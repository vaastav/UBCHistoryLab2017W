WORK, All is quiet on the Rappahannock, but it is because the wave of war has rolled be yond it. During a terrific bombardment, yesterday, which laid the rebellious city of Fredericksburg in ashes, our troops crossed on pontoon bridges, and this morning will be marshalled for fresh work beyond the Rappahannock. At present writing (12 midnight), we are without details of the fight, but we cannot believe that any con siderable share of Lee’s force remained to dispute the crossing of Burnside. Tiiev have fallen back to a fresh situation of de fense. Our army may rely upon being again met at one or more points between Fredericksburg and Richmond. The next place selected by the rebels for a stand will probably be tbe North Anna River, thirty miles south of Fredericks burg, and about a mile and a half north of Sexton’s Junction. We shall there have a stream equally formidable with the Rappahannock to traverse, at the same time that the strength of the rebel position, the shortness of their lines of communica tion, and the length and exposed condi tion of ours, will work very powerfully on the rebel side. They will expect to detain tis at the North Anna for an interval equal to that'wlnch has kept us at Frcder icksburg. The rebel journals report that our forces in North Carolina are moving towards “Weldon; and those near Norfolk are said to be operating in the same direction also. Weldon is eixty-three miles from Suffolk by railway; Petersburg, on the James River, is fifty-eight miles from Suffolk by another railroad. Weldon again is distant from Petersburg sixty-four miles by the Petersburg Railroad. If, as the Fortress Honroe reporter insinuates, General Banks is moving from Suffolk upon Petersburgh (which is distant twenty miles from Rich mond.) then General Foster would most likely attempt to meet and assist him, by way of Weldon. The strength of our forces in that part of the country it would not be proper to make public: but we may Count it certain that if General Banks is indeed in Virginia, then we have an army South of the James River quite strong enough to meet the entire rebel army in Virginia. That is to say, we should be approaching Richmond from two opposite directions, with two armies, each able alone to meet the rebel force which is pro tecting the city. Our armies in Virginia are to-day so strong that Burnside abund antly covers Washington, and meets the enemy from the north, while, on what we Considers a most probable hypothesis, a force almost equal to liis is operating on the south on the communications of the enemy. Our army is eager to fight, and is now led by fighting generals, who desire to hurt the enemy, and the goal is Richmond. THE 

VACANCY IN THE CABINET. It seems to he a settled matter that Sec retary Smith retires from the Cabinet, to lake the vacant Judgeship in Indiana. The question, as to who will be his suc cessor is being vigorously canvassed in news channels. There have been but two names mentioned; one of them is Judge Holt of Kentucky. The other seems to hV iJK a small wav Mr. O. H. Browning. Doubtless the name of tbe last has to only a limited extent been mentioned in such connection. If it bellolt that is appointed he represents somebody—brings influence and power with him. Browning brings nothxngbut a small bundle labeled Brown ing. He represents nobody, and can aid nobody. In the late election what little force he expended, was thrown, so as to help on the side of the opposition to the administration, in this State, but while he managed to injure the Republican ticket, he did not secure a scat on the Democratic train. Recently the Indiana delegation were in caucus at 'Washington and decided that their State would prefer no claims to the va cancy. There is a section of country,howev er, that might admirably well prefer claims, and strongly, to the vacant place. Draw a line from Wheeling westward to Si. Louis. North of this line you have the great Northwest, the close and firm centres of power that sustain the President, send him men, pledge him their lives and fortunes. This region has no representative in the Ca binet of Mr, Lincoln. And has it no rinims ? Why may not its prevailing sentiments of pluck, and zeal for the vigorous prosecu tion of this war, be happily placed in close juxtaposition in Cabinet meetings beside the influences that sustain do-nothing gen erals and the sit-still-and-wait policy ? We might name half a dozen men of Wiscon fnr>l Virbigauj Minnesota and lowa, to say Nothing of pails of Western States lying above the line above designated who would fill this bUL We know of one we can con-' fidently commend- We should like to see plucky, sound, sensible, and earnest John P. Potter in the position. Can the Presi dent call to his side abetter man? We urge that the locality and the principle that rules therein be represented. The free North west should have, a voice in the Cabinet As to the individual -nun), we have less care, so he he a representative man from this section. ‘ hundred and forty-three vessels have been seized by the blockading squadrons, worth, with their cargoes, $40,000,000! Veri ly, this is a splendid record, and yet it but faintly tells the stoiy of the actual amount of service rendered to the good cause by this •ceaseless, noiseless agency. 

VOLUME XV. THE CAJIPAIGI'S IN VUE . GINIA. A Utile C Uron ology. Virginia Las thus far been the chief theatre of lids war. The two capitals of the Union and Seccssia, one hundred and thirty miles apart, have been on each side the of operations, the most gigantic within *be reach of the bel ligerents. The gran*? armies of the Union have turned an* swung on Washington as a centre. I’ho rebel leaders have ne glected nothing that might promise addi- tional security to the defence of Richmond. IVilh varying fortunes, the tide of war has ebbed and flowed between these two Now the adventurous balloonist, tethered to ids cord in tbe Federal camp, has looked down into the streets of Richmond and once and again the smoke of rebel camp fires has been seen from Washington. Xow that the silence of the situation on the Rappahannock has been broken hy Burnside's cannon, and the sharp conflict of the third Federal essay against Richmond, has begun, a little retrospect of events that have made the soil of Virginia memorable in this war, inay perhapsbc of interest to our readers. The war for the Union dates from April 12th, IS6l,day memorable by tbe attack on Fort Sum. ter.- ThePresidem’s proclamation and call for 75,000 troops was issued April 15th. In six days, or on April ISih, the first troops rallying for the defense of the Union, had reached Washington. From that time forward ac tivity grew and multiplied on both sides of the struggle. The earlier battles of the war look place in Western Virginia, as Phillippi, June 3, Falling Waters July 2, Rich Mountain July 11, Garrick's Ford, July 14. Mean while the most rigorous preparations had massed our army before Washington, and strengthened Fortress Monroe with a large force. From the latter place, the failure to penetrate the York Peninsula northward had been christened in blood at Big Bethel, on June 10th. The enemy were throughout June coneen ccntrating at. Manassas, regarding that as the kej* to Richmond. The movement on this rebel fastness began from Washington July ICth, and Bull Bun came five days later. This was the first move on Eichmond. A change of commanders. The venerable commander in chief could not supervise field operations and younger energies were requir ed. Wc had won some luster to our arms in Western Virginia, mid the commander of that division of our army was called to Washing ton, where he arrived July 27th. From that lime on, preparations and preparations only. The army was noble in numbers and equip ment, but its camps closely hugged the Yir inia shore of the Potomac mouth after month, “while all the world wondered.*’ The Federal line extended with broken iuter- V;ds from a Uitllc below Alexandria, north ward, from Washington, on IheMarylandside a distance of forty miles. The enemy extended northward from Manassas to Leesburg. An ill starred movement of our right, swinging it across the Potomac, gave.us the massacre ofßalls Bluff, October 21st.then “all quiet on the Potomac,” ruled the rest, of the marvel ous season, and the winter camps, finishing he record of lbt»l. The first two months of the present year aw no change or movement on the Potomac* In the West, the mouth of February was made glorious by Fort Demy and FortDonelson, but the army of the Potomac made no sign. The earliest work of the spring took place in Virginia, on Monday, Fcbrnoiy 33d, when Gen. Banks crossed the Potomac at Harper's Ferry, the third similar movement of our ex treme right wing, the first being Ball’s Bluff, as named, the second at Hancock. On the 23d of March, after some intermediate skir mishing, took place the battle of Winchester, following which the rebels slowlv retired down the Shenandoah. The first blow struck by the rebels was the affair of the Merrimae and the Cumberland in Hampton. Roads, March Sth. The following day it was accidentally discovered that the rebel army had left Manassas, and the lair was cold. Then commenced the second move on Rich mond. Our army swept out from Its winter camps and took the field, marched inland, reached the vacated stronghold, counter marched, and bore down the river in trans ports from Alexandria. The change of plan lay wholly within the mind of the Commander in Chief. We arc giving dates, not theories. Massing at Fortress Monroe, the army of Mc- Clellan pushed north on the Tork Peninsula. •Yorktown was evacuated MaySd. Williams burg followed two days later. West Point came May 7tb. The army pressed on and crossed the Chiekahominy, the enemy assail ing onr advance eoulmn at Fair Oaks May 31st and June Ist. Onr army was then fairly be fore Richmond. Meanwhile, the rebel raid had swept northward through the Shenan doah. The Federal repulse at Front Royal took place May 24th, Gen. Banks retreating through Wincecster on the day following. At this juncture, Gen. Fremont was sum moned from his Mountain Department to the aid of Banks, and bore his share in the cam paign of the Shenandoah, which has been the theatre of varied scenes and vicissitudes of this wra in the successive changes of its occu- pancy by troops. The great, decisive battles in front of Rich mond commenced with the rebel attack on our left on Thursday, -Tone 201b, and ended on July Ist, the sixth day finding our re- pulsed army on the bank of tbe James River. This was the end of the second advance on Richmond. Gen. Pope took command of the army of "Virginia July 14. An ordt-r for Gen. McClel lan's withdrawal from the James River with Ills whole force was issued August 3, aud.aftcr a protest from Gen. McClellan, obeyed,elcvcn days later, or August 14th. Meanwhile, Gen. Pope pushed southward from Alexandria, be- yond tbc Rapidan, met the enemy in overpow ering force, met what was worse, a lack of co operation audharmony in commanders,experi enced defeat at Cedar Mountain August I>, held Ids ground until the 271h, on a new lino, to which ho had fallen back, then flanked by tbc enemy, left the Rapidan August 2Stb, and the two days following scored up the dis asters ot Bull Run, and again our army was at ■Washington. The rebels poured northward through the Talley of Virginia Into Maryland. Onr army, again under McClellan, pressed northward through Maryland, and September 14th wit nessed the encounter at South Mountain. The disgrace at Harper’s Ferry took place the following day, or on the 15th. Autictam gave its bloody but glorions record on Wcdnesdav, September 17th. and Maryland was free. With their retreat may he said to finally terminate the second movement against Richmond. As the first failure brought a change in the Federal command, so tardily In response to the second repulse, Gen. Burnside superseded Gen. McClellan, November 7th. From the point of time and the locality where the change was made, no event has marked the campaign in Virginia until now before Fred ericksburg. A failure to sustain Burnside's movement cost us long delay, which the rapid march of his army from Warrenton illy de served. Our forces reached Falmouth about tbe ICth of November, surprising the enemy, and had Burnside’s pontoons reached him with promptness, there would have been no stand by the enemy on the Rappahannock. The interval furnished them has been devoted to extraordinary preparations for defense, and the tremendous bombardment of yester day was thus made the necessary purchase of • onr crossing the Rappahannock. Farther from the Fayette ville Victory. St. Louis, Dec 11.—Gen. Blunt telegraphs Gen. Curtis that the rebels with whom he fought the battle of Prairie Grrovc, near Fay etteville, Arkansas, have probably crossed the Arkansas River. The enemy left all of hiss wonnded and most of his dead on the field. 100 of their wounded Tiave died since tliebaltle,and a large number of the remainder arc wounded mortally. The total loss of the enemy is estimated by Gen. Blunt at nearly 2,000. Our loss is about 200 killed and 500 wonnded; most of the latter will recover. Gen Herron puts the loss of tbe enemy at from 500 to 700 killed and 2,500 wounded, and estimates our own loss higher than Blunt. Lieut. Col. Black of the 37th Illinois is among the killed, and Adjt. Thompson of the 201h Illinois is among the wounded. The enemy lost five Colonels. THE WAR IN

BOATS UNDER FIRE. A Battle Will be Fonght To-day. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] FIRST DISPATCH. Washington, Dec. 11—7.30 p. m., 1502.“ The city Is wild with excitement and re- joking. Fredericksburg is ours, and all is well. It has been a glorious day's work for cur army. Dispatches liithcrto received at the War Department give few particulars, but they arc momentarily expected. The bom bardment was terrific, and the town suffered fearfully. Under the tremendous fire of our batteries our troops were thrown across, the gallant boys of tbe 7th Michigan being hon- orably mentioned as having taken the flag of the enemy. The city is nearly in ashes. All onr guns opened on the city, by Burnside’s order, at C o’clock this morning, the enemy responding with heavy guns. SECOND DISPATCH. Washington, December 11,1SC2—midnight Contrary to expectation, little farther news is yet received from Fredericksburg. It is known that our army is safely across the river, that the town is almost consumed, and that the fighting was mostly with artillery] It is stated that up to a pretty late hour, at least this afternoon, our loss had not been heavy. It seems to be that the rebels have nearly all fidlen hack a short distance, thongh nobody really knows as to that. It is still hoped that further particulars muy come in to-night. Headquauters Austy op the Potomac, ) Dec. 11, oa. m. f Everything last night was hustle and activi ty, as to-day was the time fixed for crossing the Rappahannock. During the night pon toons were conveyed to the river, and the ar tillery (143 pieces) placed in position opposite Fredericksburg. At five o’clockthis morning the rebels fired two signal guns. During the latter part of the night rocketswerc frcpuently seen to as cend within their lines. At 5 o’clock the construction of three bridges in front of tbe city was commenced. When the bridges were about half completed, the enemy opened a murderous fire of infantry frmn l«nn«r*a nn thr> river hank. Up to this time not a shot had been fired from our side. Tile engineers were driven from the bridges. Several were killed or wounded. At alx o’clock Gen. Burnside ordered all the guns to open on the city. The cannonade, which continues to the present time, is terri ble. The city is on lire. Its destruction is cert ain. At seven o’clock tbe enemy opened ’with their heavy guns from their works, hut have done no serious damage yet. Gen. Franklin constructed his bridges about three miles belowjthe city, meeting with but slight opposition. IBs troops arc now cross* ing. Gunboats arc shelling the enemy fifteen miles down the river, where they have been concentrating their forces the past few days. The concentrated fire of our batteries on the city had the cflcct of driving back the ene my’s infantry, and the work on the bridges has again been commenced. The troops are all under arms uearthe rivcri prepared to rush over as soon as the bridges are completed. 

HEADQUARTERS ARMT OF THE POTOMAC. ) Dec. 11.15U2. s' On the attempt being made to finish the bridges in front of the city, the rebel infantry again opened fire. The artillery in position again opened on it, tbc result being that it was fired in several places. The enemy has used very little artUlciy up to this time, as it would endanger their own men holding the riverfront. Burnside has issued an order to concentrate every available gnn upon the clfy,undercover of which, It is believed, the bridges can be finished. Onr killed and wounded do not amount to more than fifty. Wasiiixgtox, Dec. ll.—At 6 o’clock tins morning 143 of our guns opened fire on Fred ericksburg. Up to the latest the fire contin ued uninterruptedly. The destruction of the town appears certain. The enemy opened fire at 7 o'clock. Thus far no serious damage has been done. Franklin's division is crossing the Rappa hannock. throe miles below the city, on con structed bridges, with slight opposition. The gunboats arc shelling the enemy fifteen miles down the river. New York, Dec. 11.—A special dispatch from the N. Y. Times' correspondent with Gen. Hooker, says that the rebels continue ac tive work on their fortifications, and it is re garded ns a ruse to conceal their movements toward Richmond. Headquarters Atott of Potomac. 1 Dec. 11—Evening. ') But little firing toot place between 1 and 3 oVloi-k p. m., during which time all the avail able batteries were placed in position. They number 176 gnus. At a signal all opened on the city. The fire was terrible, but the rebel sharp-shooters couldn't be driven from their hiding places. The shot and shell went through the houses in many cases, setting them on fire, causing a dense smoke, winch, together with the explo sion of so large a quantity of powder, almost hid the city from view. It soon became evi dent that the bridges could not be built ex cept by a bold dash, and volunteers were call ed for to cross in small boats. The order was no sooner given than hundreds stepped for ward ; but all could not go, and about 100 were selected. They were soon on tbeir way, while the artillery threw a perfect storm of iron hail on the opposite bank. They reached the opposite shore but not without loss, with fixed bayonets. They rush ed upon the enemy killing several and taking 101 prisoners who were safely landed on this side. At half-past four in the afternoon two bridges were finished opposite the city, when the troops immediately began to cross over. The enemy were soon driven from the city back to their line of works. The two bridges in front of Gen. Franklin were successfully laid early in the day, but his troops did not cross until, the two upper ones were ready. A sufficient- force is now on the opposite of the river to resist any attack that is likely to be made. The rebels fired but few guns in the morning and none in the afternoon, although their works were in easy range du ring the forenoon. Tbe rebels burnt the railroad bridge outside of the city. Between thirty and forty houses were burned, mostly in the business part of the city. During the day between 8,000 and 9,000 rounds of ammunition were fired by our artillerry. Evc.ything is quiet to-night. The indica tions are that a battle will be fought to morrow. CHICAGO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 12,1862. MAHERS AT THE CAPITAL Doings of Congress Yesterday. Political and Military Changes. A Measure for Emancipation in Missouri. tee McDowell and porter TRIALS. General McClellan on the Stand. SIGNIGIGANT SUPPER PARTY [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Washingtok, Dec. 11,1862. Indiana members explain that at the meet ing of their delegation the other night, they did not wish to be understood as abandon ing any claims Indiana might have for the Cabinet vacancy,but merely decided not to in terfere as a delegation, unless the President desired it. Browning is nobody's favorite. Lieut. Col. Chas. H. Adams,of thelstHliuois light artillery, discharged from service last month for absence from his regiment, was re stored to-day by the special order of the Pres ident, it appearing that he was absent on spe cial duties under the orders of Gen. Halleck Vice President Hamlin made his first ap pearance in the Senate to-day, since some weeks before the adjournment of last session. Freeman of Kentncky, successor in the House to Gen. Jackson, killed >t Chaplin Hills, introduced resolutions condemning the President's 'proclamation. They were sum marily killed. The subject of military arrests continued to engross the Senate to-day, the immediate question being whetherthe Senate should call oil the President for reasons for the two ar rests in Delaware, the debate, however, cov ering the whole question of the President’s right to make arbitrary arrests and the man ner in which he had exercised it. Mr. Fes senden made the principal speech of the day. G. H. Davis has been appointed Baggage blaster in charge of malls between St. Louis and Odin, Illinois, vice John Belknap, re moved. Secretary "Wells, to-day, reported that he had appointed two acting midshipmen from Oliio, two from Illinois, six from lowa', and three from Missouri. [Special Dispatch to tbe Chicago Tribune.] Washington, Dec. 11— Midnight. A vigorous effort is being made to hare Brig. Gen. D. S. Stanley, of Ohio, a regular army ofiieer, given a Major Generalship. Grant and Rosccrans both recommend him. It is reported that the President may possi bly be induced by Seward to veto the Western Virginia Bill. It is not thought probable, lowcver. Rumors are in town that Banks’ expedition has returned and is binding the forces at Suf folk. Nobody knows whether to credit it or not, though some evidence seems to confirm the reports. No one was examined in the Porter Court Martial to-day, but Lieut. Col. T. C. Smith of Cincinnati, of Pope's staff He related a conversation with Gen. Porter, tbe afternoon before Friday’s battle at Bull Run. From Porter’s expression, and from his tone, looks and manners, he became convinced that it was his purpose to fiiil to co-operate with Pope. On seeing Pope that night, he told him that a certain Porter was a traitor and would fail him. He further testified Ms belief that had Por ter attacked the enemy’s right flank as order ed his defeat "would have become a.rput. In cross-examination Colonel Smith was asked to give bis reason for IMs belief. His reasons were that the enemy consisted of several divisions of the rebel army detached from the main force which was towards and beyond Thoroughfare Gap. EverytMng during the day indicated nearly all the force they had in the field was on our front; that about the time Porter should have made his attack the enemy had become so ex hausted as to be obliged to give back. That attack on : Ms right flank at that time must have overpowered him, and by cutting Ms line of retreat, rolling him up to the northeast upon Pull Run, have caused Ms rout. Being asked whether he knew the ground on the enemy’s right was practicable for Por ter to make attack, Smith replied, he believed it to be so from the general character of the country there. And because on Saturday the enemy moved over this very ground to attack onr left. It begins to be believed that the finn] upebot-of Porter’s and McDowell's court will be to necessitate the court martial of Mc- Clellan. Considerable curiosity is manifested to see how McClellan will testify in the Porter case, where it is expected to come plump against Pope’s evidence. The Committee on Ways and Means to-mor row take up the estimates of the Deficiency Appropriat ion BUI. The House adjourned over to-day till Mon day, to give committees opportunity to ma ture work. McClellan, in the examination before the McDowell Court to-day, answered the ques tion he had declined to answer yesterday. The question was, “Ton have stated that the troops wore retained for the defense of Washington, Did those plans provide for the force to be retained from the force under your command, and if so, how large, was to be re tained, and what troops were to compose it "3” McClellan answered that the troops to be retained for the defense of Washington were almost entirely from those under Ms imme diate command. He could not state from memory as to the precise force, but on the Ist of April he sent a letter to the Secretary of War giving full particulars of the forces left for the defense of Washington. There wore 70,000 men, independent of tho corps of McDowell. Instructions were given in regard to positions of these troops; He contemplated posting the mass of them In the vicinity of Manassas, on the line of the Manas sas Gap Railroad near Front Royal, so that the whole force would he available on either approach to tMs city. In reply to questions by the court, witness said: “I think Gen. McDowell was correct in his opinion, that it was safe and properfor Mm to unite with the army of the Fotomac immediately after the occupation of Hanover Courthouse by a portion of the army of the Potomac.’’ There was no rebel force between Hanover Courthouse and McDowelL There might have been some rebel cavalry, bnt no force of any consequence. The main object of Jackson’s movement against Banks was to prevent reinforcements being sent to the army of the Potomac. I expressed that opinion in a letter to the President. Within a day or two of the time I received information of Jackson's move ments, if General McDowell had moved di rect upon Hanover Courthouse instead of the direction of Front Royal, Jackson would have rapidly retired to join the main army at Rich mond. With a strong army of our own in the vicin ity of Richmond and threatening, I do not think the rebels would have detached a suffi cient force to seriously endanger the safety of Washington. Question. —What was the largest number of troops suggested by any corps commander to be left for the defense of Washington ? and in this connection state the number recom mended by Gen- McDowell. Answer. —My recollection is that the sug gestions as to the forces to be left variedfrom 40,000 to 50,000. I think Gen. McDowell proposed the latter number. Of one tiling I am confident, that with facts fresh in iny mind I thought it more than was suggested by any corps commander. This testimony Is said to conflict in some material points with the evidence’in the pos session of the War Department, and it is in timated that rebutting testimony may possi bly bo introduced. Sam. Cox gave a dinner this eveningto Gen McClellan, and Gen. Porter and Wickliffe, Of Kentucky. Certain others of the Kentucky delegation are invited guests. The composi tion of the party is regarded as highly signifi cant. New York, Dec. 11.—A special dispatch to a morning paper says: It is reported on very direct and trustwor thy authority, that President Lincoln has opened a correspondence on matters of na tional concern with the Governor elect of 2s ew York. Late advices from Kansas give of the arrest of Colonel Adams' and ' Lieutenant Colonel Hayes, of the 12th Kansas volunteers, in Western Missouri, by General Vaughan of the Missouri State Gnards. Adams had made a successful expedition into Missouri against the guerillas, capturing about 100 wagons and fifty negroes, and on being ordered by Vaughan to surrender the negroes and prop perty and leave the State, expresseda willing ness to comply with all the demands except the surrender of the negroes, which he re fused. Vaughan having a force of 1,000 men with artillery, and Adams only 250, the latter had no chance but compliance, and has been sent to St. Louis for trial on the 15th iust. Adams is a son-in-law of Senator Lane of Kansas. Washington, Dec. 11.— Mr. Noell of Mo., has prepared a bill which he will introduce in the House, to submit the proposition of President Lincoln to the State of Missouri. That'upon the adoption by that State of a sys-. tern for the immediate abolition of slavery therein, to take effect on or before the first day of January, 1861, the United States will provide for the compensation to loyal owners of slaves to the extent of $20,000,000 in United States bonds redeemable in thirty years, and will remove to some place out of the United States, and colonize suchaf the emancipated slaves as shall leave the Slate. The President to-day sent a message to the Senate, in compliance -with a resolution of Dec. oth, requesting the President to furnish the Senate with all the information in his possession touching the late Indian barbarities in the State of Minnesota, and also the evi dence in his possession upon which some of the principal actors and head men were tried and condemned to death. from mm km below.

Hovcy's expedi tion from Helena into Mississippi cut up and destroyed a portion of the Mississippi Rail road and burned bridges and otherwise Injur ed the Mississippi and Tennessee road. Dur ing the progress of the expedition it met and engaged the enemy at three different points, in all of which encounters the Federal arms were successful and the rebels driven before our infantry as well as cavalry. Skirmishes were fought first at Tallahatchie, the 2d, at Torkney River, and the 3d near Oakland. This last was the most severe, and in it Gen. Hovey’s men lost fifteen horses and a few were wounded, but none killed. One cannon was lost—the horses being all shot. Gen. Hovey states that he did occupy Gre nada, nil other reports to .the uot wiQfttatiduig, without the loss of a also captured a rebel courier with important dispatches from one general to another stating that the Confederates would certainly fight at the Big Black. It is supposed they were retreating toward Canton, Miss., being afraid to.pass through Grenada, knowing the Fcderals were there, to escape gobbling up. Their trail ran cast of Grenada. I hear a report that Vicksburghasbecu sub jected to another bombardment. ; Gen. Hovey passes up on the steamer Sun shine to-day, on a visit to Ms wife, at Mt.

A gentleman from Holly Springs says the last word from the Confederates was, that they were retreating, and the impression pre vailed that they would not make a stand until they reached Jackson, wherethey could easily concentrate from Mobile and Vicksburg. The steamer Polar Star has just returned from a trip below Helena. At Council Bend 100 guerillas came to the levee and not suc ceeding in hoarding the steamer, burned some cotton then ready for transportation. On Thursday the boat went eighty-five miles be yond the Pcdcrallines toKnowUon’s Landing, five miles below. The steamer Catahoula was tied to the bank and appeared to be in the hands of the rebels. At Abercrombie’s Landing on the return trip, fifteen or twenty guerillas came to the banks and shouted “ d—-n Lincoln, d—u the gunboats, d—n the Union and hurrah for Jeff. Davis,' 1 but they did not offer to molest the boat or goods. It appears some cottonactnally comesthro 1 these meus hands, wMch they have stolenfrom ibeir friends, into hands of Union merchants The Polar Star returned to Helena, Saturday morning. Richmond papers of the 29th demand a demonstration equal to Austcrlitz or Jena, aud say one such battle would decide the con test and place Washington in their hands. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Cairo, Dec. 11, ISGi News matters arc very quiet here to-day. Lt. G. W. McDonald who was accidentally shot here two weeks ago by a brother officer in the Irish Legion has so for recovered as to be able to walk about on crutches.

Baldwin being under ar rest, is a base fabrication. Jxo. Phillips, Co. A, 57th Reg. El. YoL Cairo, Dec. 11.—I have received from an officer who left Oxford on Monday reliable in formation from General Grant's army. The mnin body of bis Infantry ‘was then encamped near to and south of Oxford. Cavalry under Col. Dickey were some thirty miles farther down the road, near Coffee ville, and within fifteen miles of Grenada. It is not probable that a movement would be made by the in fantry before to-day, for the reason that they were waiting the arrival of a supply train from Holly Springs, wliich would not reach them before this morning. Many of the regiments were short of rations. From Memphis we have contradictory re ports as to whether the rebels occupy Grenada. Be that as it may, Grant will occupy it when ever he gets ready to move forward. The transport Tolar Star-has just returned from a trip down the river, eighty-five niiles below the Federal lines. While at Council. Bend, 100 guerillas came to that place and burned some cotton. Five miles below Laconia the steamer Cata hanla was tied to the shore, and from appear ances it was thought she had been captured. When hailed by men on board thp Polar Star no reply was made. , , , The guerillas are anxious to trade cotton, which they have confiscated, for supplies, and as a general thing do not interfere with boats whi(3i trade witlTthem. , . The Texas Bangers hold possession of the country south ana west of White river. . Gen. Hovey is expected here to-day. He is on his way home to see his wife who is very ill. Philadelphia, Dec. 10.—A dispatch to the Ircss says: Bcports from Grant’s army indicate that the troops arc brought to a stand-still owing to the muddy roads, ten miles beyond Granada. The tenor of government dispatches show that Pemberton has gone to Alabama to form a junction with the rebel forces in Tennessee, Grant cannot follow at present. It is rumored that the Mississippi is now nearly clear of rebels, and Vicksburg can be easily taken. GRENADA. &c., &c. SECOND DISPATCH. THE WAR IN TENNESSEE.

Johnson is about to issue a -proclamation, assessing the wealthy-rebels of Nashville to the amount of $60,000 for the support of the indigent durin°- the winter. The list contains all the prom? nent rebel sympathizers In the city. All is quiet in front to-day. Gen. Neglcy,.-at his own request, has been relieved from the command of the city. He takes the field. General Mitchell succeeds him. , Gen. Johnson captured in August at Galla tin, having been exchanged, has been assigned to the command of the 2d division. Nashville, Dec. 10.—Col.

He commanded the 51st Ohio, 35th Indiana and 21st Kentucky infantry, with one gun of Swallow's 7th Indiana battery, escorting fifty forage wagons. Ten men. and a sergeant of the 21st Kentncky were left fora guard at Dobbins’ Ferry, and the wagon filled, when Wheeler’s rebel cavalry brigade, 12th Tennes see infantry and a full battery attacked In the rear. The 51st Ohio and 35th Indiana were taken hack by Matthews at double quick, and in thirty minutes the enemy was repulsed. The wagons were retired rapidly to camp, es corted by the 51st Ohio and 3th Kentucky, forming the rear guard. Half an hour later, the enemy attacked ns again in our rear, and after sharp fighting were repulsed. The brig ade returned to camp without losing a wagon. Lieut. Col.

Five wounded and one dead were left behind from iuabllitv to cariythcm off They were conveyed to Dr. Charleston’s residence, near the field. The rebel loss has not been ascertained.

Dodges the San Jacinto at Martinique, . New York, Dec. 11.—A Vessel has arrived here having the officers and crew of the ship Levi Starbuck, capture! by the pirate Ala bama and burned Nov. 2d, latitude 35:30, lon gitude 66. The Alibama also captured the sMp T. B. Walls, of Boston, Nov. Bth, in lati tude 28:30, longitude 58. The Alabama went to Martinique, arriving on the 17th November. The San Jacinto ar rived on the same afternoon, and, finding the Alabamr there, went outside to wait for her. On the 18th, at 10 o'clock at night, the Ala bama escaped. The San Jacinto was still off the harhor on the 23d. LATER, New York, Dec. ll.— The Alabama, until close upon the captured vessels, carried the American flag. The crews of the two vessels, except Capt. Sinclair of the T. B. Wales, were kept in irons till they reached Martinique. Semmes said she was the twenty-third vessel, he bad burned. The second mate and eight of her crew joined the Alabama’s crew, winch now numbers 150. Upon the arrival of the San Jacinto at Martinique she furnished the brig Hammon, in port, with rockets to be sent up when the Alabama was leaving port. The San Jacinto also kept two armed boats plving about the harbor at night but they did not observe her exit. The Alabama was furnished with a pilot by tbe French authority, and was, it is supposed, piloted out by a channel unknown to the San Jacinto. The Hammond was immediatelv seized bv the French authorities and was still in custo dy when the schooner Alice left. The San Jacinto was three miles at sea and onlv knew of the Alabama’s escape when the Alice came out. The cargo of the T. B. Wales was valued at $200,000. The Alabama went to Martinique to receive coal from an English brig, the latter also brought her’ two Armstrong 100-pounders. The brig went off with the Alabama. It was reported at St. Thomas that the Ala bama had been piloted into the harbor of St. Johns, a fewmilcs above, and was there taking in coal and guns. The intelligence was sent to the San Jacinto. Semmes boasted of having been at one time within seventy miles of Sandy Hook. PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS. Washington. December 11,1562. SENATE. Messrs. HALE of N. H. and SUMNER of Mass, presented petitions protesting against the action of the Advisory Board of the nauv. Messrs. KING of N. Y., POMEROY of Kan. sas and HOWARD of Michigan presented pe titions in favor of a generalbankrupt act. Mr. BROWNING of HI. introduced a bill to amend tbe act establisMng the Territorial government of Ut:ih, and to facilitate the ad ministration of justice in said Territory. Re ferred to the Judiciary Committee. A message was received from the President, recommending a vote of thanks to Lient. Geo. W. Morris, for the determined valorand hero ism he displayed in defense of the sloop-of war Cumberland against the rebel iron-clad Merrimac: also recommending a vote of thanks to Lient. Geo. L. Worden for the skill and gallantly esMbitedby Mm in the battle between the* Monitor and rebel steamer Mer rimac. Referred to Naval Committee. A communication was also received from the President, answering a resolution of the Senate calling for information and evidence relative to the Indian barbarities in Minne sota. Ordered printed. The resolution relative to the arbitrary ar rests of certain citizens of Delaware was taken up. Mr. 

MORRILL of Me. contended that the resolution as it now stood was not a mere resolution of inquiry, but a charge against the government and an’ indictment against Presi-. ent Lincoln, and he (Mr. Morrill) should vote for no such resolution. He claimed that In this state of war and rebellion, with the land full of traitors and spies, the Command er-in-CMef has the right to arrest such men. No one, not even the senator from Delaware, (Mr. Saulsbuiy), had claimed that these men were loyal. There had been many arrests made, and the proper presumption is that the President has been arresting guilty men, and simply doing Ms duty. He (Mr. Lincoln) ought to do it. It will not do to pretend that a whole State and all its people are loyaL It is known that the State of Ken tucky has been but a nest of traitors. Three out of every four of the able-bodied men of Kentucky have gone to reheldom, and nobody is left there hut old women. Yet, the Senator from Kentucky (Powell) had denounced the Government from the beginning, the same as Ms colleague, who followed the logical result of his reasoning, and had gone into the rebel army, hut not a single worn does Sena tor Powell offer against the rebels, and re joices over the recent elections, and says the : lion-hearted Democracy are rebuking this Ad ministration. Well, every rebel throughout rebeldom re joices In the same way. It is supposed there will be a peace party in the North that will force this Government into an inglorious peace, and that party encouraged Jeff Davis and foreigh countries in their schemes of in tervention. There ought to he some proof" that these men were loyaL Mr. 

BAYARD of Del., argued at some length to show that the affairs of the State of Kentucky had nothing whatever to do. with the State of Delaware, and ttxn the country did not imply h&adi&jto anw* single individual, •If tins is a freocountiy tize people In it certaiillVljaxea right to? inquire into the acts of thePresMeht. _ Mv. POWELL of Ky., said he had arid the President had violated the constitution, and he was ready to prove it. He defied the Sen ator from Maine, or any Senator on this floor, to the lists on this question. He denied that three out of f<mr of the people of the State of Kentucky were in the rebel army. Three fourths of the people of that State are not in arms -at all, and he believed that . .there were more men in the Umon than the rebel army. He (Powell) wanted to indulge in no personalities with any Senator here, as there was a way to settle personal matters else where. He wanted Senators to meet his arm ments lairly. He did not believe this Union could ever be restored by force of arms* therefore he opposed the war and should con tinue to oppose it He was in favor of the convention proposed by his colleague (Davis.) He should also vote for an armistice while that convention should continue to be in ses sion- He contended that President Lincoln violated the Constitution in enlarging the reg ular army, in suspending the writ of habeas corpus „ in arresting citizens, in interfering with the freedom of the press, and in his re cent proclamation. Mr. 

FESSENDEN was willing to admit some things had been done apparentlv with out law. The cry the country was in' dano-er came always from papers sympathizing with the rebellion. Many things may be and must be done in times like-these which ordinarily could not beallowed._ : Does' anvbody doubt the patriotism of the President o*f the United States V Does any one pretend that he has not done what he. thought was best to sup press this rebellion and preserve the countrv or that he has wilfully violated the rights of any citizen? [No adjournment received here (Buffalo) up to 1:20 a. m.— Operator. 

HOUSE. The bill passed to adjust the appropriation heretofore made for the civil service of the Navy Department, to correspond with the re cent organization of the Department. Mr. ROSCOE CONKLING asked leave to report a bill to establish a uniform system, of bankruptcy, and desired a day should be as signed for its consideration. Mr. MORRILL contended that there was no ground complaint, that men were ar rested ou suspicion, for they were always ar rested on suspicion of crime. Mr. ‘WRIGHT of Indiana moved to amend the resolution so as to make the call upon the President instead of upon the Secretary of War, Mr. Wright said he knew no man was permitted to live in the South who had any sympathy with the North. He would like to see some of the spirit that was shown bv Stonewall Jackson when ho found forty-sev en of his men skedaddlimr from the battle, he marched them in front of the regiment and had every man of them shot. Instead of this we have propositions for conventions. He (Wright) would stand bv the government and the President. lie would have the power of the government felt bv every traitor, North or South. TheSPEAKER rcmindecUhegcntlemcn that the Select Committee on that subject had ex pired with the former session of Congress and would have to be revived. Mr. YEATMANof Mo., offered the follow ing to lie over for further consideration: Jfcsolred. By the Hon sc of Representatives, the Senate concurring, that the proclamation of the President, of the 22d of November. I6>J2, is not warranted by the Constitution. Jle*dred. That the notice of eraancination, as indicated!]} the proclamation, is not calculated to hasten the restoration of peace; is not well chosen as a war measure, ami is an assnmption of power dangerous to the rights of citizens and the perpe tuity of a free government. Mr. LOVEjOY moved to lay the resolution on the tabic. Carried by 04 against 45. The House then went into Committee of the Whole on the President’s Message. Mr. 

HUTCHINS of Ohio spoke at length, taking for a text that freedom and slavery are incompatible, beyond hope of reconciliation and compromise. Mr. MENZIES of Ind.. replying, said ho was in the habit of regarding tlic enemies of the proclamation as tlic friends of the Consti tution. He understood the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.Huti-hinsUn beopposedto the Union as it was. No doubt the reasons assigned by him for rcccntdefcnts of the Republicans were satisfactory to the gentleman himself, but he, (Monzics,) would tell him that these disasters to that party wcrcattributabletothe abolition programme of the President and his party. Mr. Meuzics recapitulated the measures adopted by the Republicans including the abolition of slavery and the conlisoation act which he said were shocking to the civiliza tion of the age. The recent 'elections,: how ever, were more appalling to the rebels than anything that could happen, because a free people who will not submit to the tyranny at "Washington will not submit to the overthrow of the Constitution.by the rebels. The committee arose and the House ad journed. - Orleans. New York, Dec. from New Orleans the 4th, has arrived. Tfnr newspapers contain no accounts of military movements. The election in the Ist Congressional dis*. trict of Louisiana resulted in the choice of Mr. Flanders by a vote of 2,180 against 100 for Bonligny, and in the 2d district Hahn received I,444,"Dewitt 904. Greathouse 325, Barker 282 votes. Another Rebel Pirate.
