graves It is Impossible however for some persons not to worry They are r so constituted that the slightest trou l t blet or even Inconvenience make them miserable They fret over tmag nary Ills as well as real ones Tin t habit grows and its wearing effect becomes worse constantly until th physical frame weakens and breaks I under It But the habit of worrying like an other habit can be resisted with more I or less success The battle against It should begin early In life It should be part of tile selfeducation of every individual Natural tendencies can often be checked and in many cases entirely overcome Wo have all seen persons who have exceptional reasons for worrying ant I I yet were the gentlest and sweetest tem pered of our acquaintances These ji illustrations of selfconquest should be e inspiring to us all Most of us are apt II to look for trouble When things an going reasonably well with us we wor I I ry because they are no better When there is no real trouble In sight we im agine that there is plenty of It just be yond the reach of our vision and make ourselves unhappy without cause It has been said that we suffer more from dread of troubles that never come than from any actual experience Old General Dow has given us a valuable hint and if we use it rightly it will conduce to our comfort and hap piness and to our prospects of long life Atlanta Journal 3 A Long War
