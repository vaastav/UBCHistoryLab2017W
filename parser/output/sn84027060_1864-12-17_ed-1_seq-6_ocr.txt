WASHINGTON, Dec. 10,1864. In the Supreme Court, on assembling, tbe proceedings were inaugurated by eu logies upon tbe late Chief Juatice. Thia waa regular and right. And the deceased well deserved high compliments. He waa a Christian a conscientious man aa up right aad able judge but few liable to have been appointed woulfl have better filled tbe place. But why aay more than was due, except in hyperbole which was •Aderstandable by everybody—why say more, deliberately He was, by eminent lawyers, eulogised as the greatest of our Chief Justices. Everybody kaows tbat waa»untrne. No sensible aod intelligent mad will dispute with Chief Justice Mar shall tbe first place in our Judiciary, on behalf of any one. Nor, indeed, ia there any reason to believe that he was the equal of his successor—though Mr. Chase may, of course, prove less than is to be pre sumed, oertaiuly be is, however, intefiec tually greater tban Judge Taney. He haa a broader mind and more intellectual at-, tainments. Again: Why, because be is dead, justi fy everything he did while living? As much is due to the truth of history as to tbe memory of an individual. There was a defense of bis Dred Scott decision oa that funeral occasion. But everybody knows tbat, in tbe case of Dred Scott, the Chief Justice reversed tbe previous doctrine of tbe Supreme Court, and in unnecessaiy obiter dicta: there was a stretch of duty u serve tbe cause of slavery in such an act everybody knows tbat he turned his back upoii himself in doing it, for he himself had previously given a negro standing in Court, anddeaided in favor of tbe negro on the merits of the case, at tbat tbat he overrode unquestioned and unquestionable ilets, quoted to bim by Judge Curtis and Others, to establish tbe primary basis of his argument on that occasion. No. Let tbat act stand accursed—a blot and a shame on our jurisprudence, until it ia reversed, and let him who performed it, fitly accompa nying it with those memorable words, "A negro bas no rights tbat a white man is bound to respect," be he dead or living, wear upon bia reputatioa the ignominy, that all just-minded men will uttach to it. The removal of thedeposita was even de fended on that occasion—so old a deed as that and it, too, properaa.it might have been of itaelf, and exira official act—an act which it is bard to deny as above the law, if not in clear contradiction to it. Having said this, it ia proper to add, that science than moot men would have done for whils he treated his own a eg roes with a child*like kindness,—among the last acts of his life being a tender embrace, becom inga christian brother aad a pure-hearted man, of an old negro servant,—he was thoroughly saturated with tbe pro-slavery notions ot bis class, who repealed the Mis souri Compromise, enacted tbe Lecompton outrage, invaded Kansas with ruffian hordes and overthrew long-established ju dicial safeguards in order to extend the empire of Human Servitude. It was his creed, bis belief, inwoven with bis educa tion, a conscientious conviction, though it is not to be denied that his conscience was miserably tutored in tbat regard, nor that be followed tbe direction of hia miod with aa uaaeemly, unusual, disreputable alac rity in that emiaent instance. With theee criticisms, due to Liberty, to Law, and to History, I concur in the touch ing and sincere eulogies on the death of the departed. An interesting Incident has lately come to my knowledge, that is worth recording. A short time previous to our Presidential election a large number of the leading slaveholders of Cuba put in the bauds oi tbe Captain-General, a petition for the ab olition of slavery iu that island, with thd request that he would forward it to tbe home government for action. He took it, but refused to forward it, and gave no ex planation of his conduct. Since the elec tion of Mr. Lincoln he has forwarded be probably damned the nMro r»(* iko' Vd ^^ntofall the Societies in tbe State, Union, one part being slaveholding and one free, in which case it would have been for the interest of Cuba to have retained slavery, whereas now the Union was to be preserv ed and tbe whole nation to become free, it waa for tbe intereat of Cuba to get rid of slavery also. Though mole-eyed men in thia country conld not read the signs of tbe times in coonectiou with their own public affairs, especially through the spectacles of party faoaticism, a foreigoer, with millions aependiog, was clear sad oertala enough. IOWA. Every dispositioo is msoifested to have aa active session, and it would appear as if buainetfa waa to be attended to with an un uaual diligeuce. It makes oae almost sick to aee the awsrms of "operators" here to lobby in couneotiott with so many of tbe great iu terwts to be affected by the ioleraal tax aad tariff lawa. If members are to give themselvea up to their consultations and beseecbings, the session will be s miserable abortion. And it will take a stiff back and resolute determiaatioa to keep them off. They should be heard, but oaly by deputa tioa in Committee, aad a limited and stip ulsted cumber of times. Tbe whiaky mea are more numerous and importunate,—aay, threatening and impe rioua,-tbao aay others. They threaten t^ shut up shop/ Only think of that. Tie faot is, tbey pay leas tax, under stress of extraordinary circumstances in this coun try, than in almoat any considerable Euro pean State, And yet they threaten and swear like a Flandera army. Don't they know that people will bave liquor, any way? To be sure they do. It is more a movement for a new speculation tban aay thing else. Governmeat raised all thefi stock en their hands, immensely, last ses- ff V aion. And they are not satisfied, yet. They want it to "do so more." They are more soiioitpus about modifications of the tax enuring to their advantage rather than to the advantage of the Treasury, than they are aqout mere amounts, though amouuts agitate them severely enough. The liquor bnsinesa Is a vice tbat will bear the biggest burden with the greatest ease, and is tbe most legitimate subject of heavy taxation. Tobacoo is in trouble, too. But I do not understand the objection, oo tbe part Oi the dealers in the weed ia so much to the amount aa to tbe manner of taxation of that article. And doubtless the manner of deal ing with tbe weed should be and will be radically changed. Tobacco is easily to be got alhng with with, as compared with wbiskgr, limhense as is the interest in it. A aew and powerful effort will be made to pass the anti-slavery amendment to tbe oon»tUmidn. Those who have taken sound ings in tbat regard settn to feel a consider able degree of conQrience that it will pass. But it is too early yet to judge. It depends upon the temper of ci"p|erheads, and tbat has n^t fully ^disclosed itself yet. Consti tutional abolition of slavery is a certain event. Every one understands that. But whether Copperheads will, this early, ac cept this fact, and conclude to swim with tbe current of fate, or fight against it, ia yet to be ascertained, and depends altogeth er npon wbetber personal ambition and practical sense or party malignity proves to be uppermost in their bearta and their counsel* Ouly a few Cope are necessary to tnsfire tbe result. Tbe bankrupt bill will be early on the docket.* Tbe fall electiona not including the fare of any membera of Congress, ia a fact which makea in ita favor. I think the chances of ita passage are very favorable indeed, and tbat if it posses it will pass in a form in which it will he likely to endure. A great many copies of the bill, aa it was substantially perfected laat seasioo, have been aent through tbs country into the hands of leadiag commercial men and tra ders of all sorts duriug tbe summer, so tbat it has been well scaoaed by parties most likely to be luterested ia it, and ob jections and modifications tbat have conse quently been suggested will be made early. There ts bettor feeling here, in our own party, tban ever before since the rebellion declared itselfand the true temper and dis position of the Administration was made manifest. Events have brought all true Uniop men necessarily into more thorough accord, by narrowing the grouuds of dif ference between them as to the more prom inent pablio topics.

Tfce state of public sentiment on tnis oause is rapidly beooming all that oonld be asked or wished for by its most enthusias tic friends. Tbe more it is investigated and the clearer the light, the better it stands and tbe more favor it receives.

Mr. J. H. Hartrock and Lieut. E. Frack er attended iny meeting in Iowa City with a favorable opinion of tbe cause and a pur- Eearitsg ir, with the explanation, to the signers, tbat the reason he did not previously forward it was because, if McClellan was elected, there would be a division of our ose to do something f*r it. But, upon i: fully, they advanced from five to tifty dollars with cheerful hearts. Noble men s-ay to me, "I went to your meeting with a dollar or two for your cause, but aoon feit that it would te a privilege to give a Life membership."

And it is proof enough of it tbat in u y five months and one week which I bave diligently devoted to raising money I have averaged $2,209 a week. And then, in ail this good public sentiment, and in the bestowment upon this cause of tbe best intelligence and heart of tbe State, Iowa inaugurates a new era on the ques tion and care of orphanage.
