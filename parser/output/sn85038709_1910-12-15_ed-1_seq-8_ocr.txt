Seldom has a young man risen in the politics of a state so rapidly as has V. F. Knox in the political circles of Michigan during the past two years. Two years ago Mr. Knox took an ac tive part in the republican campaign but did not come under statewide no tice. This year he managed the cam paign of Governor Elect Osborne in the Primaries and after Osborne's nomination was made chairman of the Republican State Committee. That the committee chose its leader wisely is shown by the success of the party when other whole states were revers ing on the G. O. P. Mr. Knox left this week for Washington and New York whcre.among other things he will have a conference with Roosevelt. The Free Press in speaking of a re cent visit of Knox to Detroit gives the following: "W. Frank Knox, of Sault Stc. Marie, chairman of the Republican sate central committee, was in the city yesterday on his way to Wash ington and New York. He received an invitation to attend the Gridiron club dinner, which will be held on Saturday, but according to statements made by him to his friends he is going to New York to secure a political conference with Col. Roosevelt, who commanded the Rough Riders, of which he was a member.

Roosevelt is going to be ct candidate Knox wants to be his Michigan manager and will submit as nas credentials the fact that he is now at the head of the Republican state organization. ttcforc leaving the city Knox talked the matter over with several of his friends, and promised to bring back something definite as to Col. Roosevelt's future political plans." Deserves Great Credit. John Quincy Adams deserves great credit for the excellent manner in which the Comedy f Errors was pre sented. It is not the purpose of this paragraph to laud the play. Those who. witnessed it have said that it was very well done. That is enough. Hut Coach Adams deserves especial credit for whatever worthy rf praise was done last Tuesday evening. Not de tracting from the honors of the in dividual players, it seems safe to say that there was none who can rightly claim any extraordinary ability along the dramatic line. Yet the fact that Professor Adams took this company of willing young people and in a few short weeks iiv spite of illness and losses of players, in spite of the fact that he himself had a difficult part of the play, produced as heavy a play as Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors in such a satisfactory way, shows re markable coaching and executive ability.
