Upon tho , temper of the Democratic leaders de- . pends entirely the amount and the , character of the legislation to be en- ; acted into law at the present session of the 61st congress President Taft and his advisers have outlined an ambi tious program. How much of it he may be able to put through is a problem j no one at this early day would be jus- , tified in predicting. The country has heard much of the rules of the house of representatives ( during the past two years. Within that . period material changes have been . made in the methods for controlling , the house. Among other things the , rules have been so modified by provid- j Ing for specific performances that but three days each week may be set aside j for the general business of the house- j The short session of a congress expires By COnSLllUUUimi mujuiuuu til ki. months. It meets the first Monday in December, and dies, automatically, -at noon on the 3rd of March following. This gives it but three months for ac tual work, theoretically. As a matter of fact, that time actually is much less. J There usually is a holiday recess tnat consumes a fortnight. -Adjournments over from Friday to Monday cause a loss of valuable time, and in the end, by reason of these various causes, there remain only about 60 working days for the congress, reduced to quite half that time in the house as a result of the new rules. "Within this short space experi- nee has proved that it is well nigh impossible to do more than enact the supply bills by which the funds are provided for the maintenance and sup port of the various branches of the government. May Hurry House But Hot Senate. The foregoing, therefore, indicates what ordinarily is the situation in con rress during a short session. Special rules providing for emerpencies are possible in the house and there debate can be limited and delay prevented. In the senate there is nothing akin to cloture, and so long as a single senator desires to speak there is no way to bring debate to a close. It is in the senate, Therefore, that the danger comes if obstacles are thrown in the -way of an outlined legislative pro gram. In the face of all this the ad ministration has mapped out a pro gram that will require the, most adroit political and legislative management to bring to fruition.

"t- attention, in view of the result of the recent elections, is the proposed reap- portlonment. This is the determination , of the allntmpnt nf mmhiT-c nf tii i house of representatives to the various j states, based upon the population as- j certained by each decennial census. While this ought not to be a political ' question, it invariably involves poli- ! tics, and the Republicans are anxious ' to deal with it while they control both houses of congress. It is not essential j that this new reapportionment be en- ' acted Into law at this session, and if a I bill considered unfair be submitted the Democrats in the senate may be count- ! ed upon to prevent its conclusion before ! March 3. Beis of Representation The present representation is one representative to every 134,182 of pop ulation, making a total membership of the house of 391. Upon the same fig ures the membership of the house thereafter would Tie enlarged material ly. There is opposition to increasing j-j. -mcic i& opposition to increasing the size of the house, which already is , unwieldy, and the proposition will be made tO finlftTPP fhe "haoir flmn-oo Tl-.,. I will bring about an increase of mem- bership in some of the larger states, j and result in loss in some of the less thickly populated. It easily is seen, therefore, why the Republicans are anxious to deal with this subjefct and retain whatever of political advantage the situation may .have. A big fight is promised with regard to the tariff board for which the pres ident asks a still larger appropriation and, incidentally, increased authority In the matter of conducting Its Inquiries and making its investigations both at ! home and abroad. Many leading Dem ocrats, like senator Bailey, for instance are opposed to the tariff commission plan and will antagonize this. Whether thej- can do so to the end that consider ation and final determination will be postponed until the Democrats control the house, remains to be seen. The I president is very earnest in this matter, j protect men i.pprhei'dc-i through, th Then, too, there are many men in both agency of the federal courts at least, parties who believe the tariff should Much Talk ond Little Action be removed from politics entirely, and . if one attempted to perdict- what will men of this view hold that this probably ! be done at the coming session it would may be accomplished through a com- ; be safe only to prophesy that the ap mission, and are Inclined to give It a j propriatlon bills and Incidental meas J teJf " ' ures necessary to the ordinary conduct If the effort threatened by senator! of the government will be enacted into Gallmger and others to push through a law. There will be much talk and very snip suDsiay dui at tne short session , is made seriously it promises to precip itate a time-consumins: contest. The Democrats are opposed to this sort of legislation. , It does not appear likely that Aldrich will be able to put through anj-thing in the shape of a revision of the cur rency laws at the coming session, al though he has been credited with hav ing that in mind. Time will be too J short to admit of full and free consid eration of so important a subject 3Iany Conservatlop .Schemes. The administrations legislative plan includes also various conservation schemes, an anti-injunction 'bill giving relief, in a measure at least, demanded by organized labor, and a plan of pen sion retiremert for aged civil employes of the government. With the end in view of forming a cohesive Republican working force to accomplish that which he has at heart, ,the president has had several conferences with lead ing regulars and progressives at which his program has been thoroughlj threshed out. The outlook seems to be good for united action of all classes of Republicans in the senate but as has been intimated, the danger comes J CASffu. stu&o. congress will disappear nt the close from those Democrats who will an- tagonize ail tnat Dears a political :s- j Pect in proposed legislation. The session mav not he without its share of sensational incident. The committee whicly investigated the 3al- j l'nger-Plnchot controversy has con- ( eluded its labors and Its report is ready j fcr tne consideration of the two houses J of congress. By the majority of the j Joint committee the secretary of the! interior is exonerated; by the minority, ! including one progressive Republican, j Pinchot is sustained, and the discussion of the report doubtless will cause some j sensational speeches in both houses. Liorlmer Report Ready. The Lorimer bribery chartres. arrow ing out of the allegations that the Illi nois senator was elected through the i corrupt Use of money, were investigat- j ed by a senatorial committee during the summer and that report is ready. The impression here is that the com mittee did not find the charges sus tained by evfdence that was of suif1- lamea Dy eviaence tnat was or sUft- I cient importance to warrant an unfa-! vorable report.

"M .U.K i""- Sixty working days "is all too pated short a time for the consideration. even, of the supply bills in these days when economy is the watchword, and the leaders -find it uphill work to prac- tice economy in the face of the demands of individual members, each laboring zealously for appropriations of value to his own district without regard to the general welfare and unmindful of the recommendations of the president and- the efforts of department heads to pare down the budget to the lowest possible minimum. What will happen when the new con gress-comes into action is a problem to J the solution of which neither Republi can nor Democrat will now attempt to apply himself. It is a question for the future, and no answer is forthcoming. Look for Extra Session. Leaders among the Republicans, as well as among the Democrats, are pre dicting that events are tending toward an extra session of the new congress, either immediately on the expiration of the next session, or early in the sum mer. These leaders believe that if president Taft does not call such a ses- I sion for the consideration of a revision of the tariff schedules that the Demo cratic or Republican leaders may force an extra session by holding up the passage of the necessary appropriation bills. The Democratic leaders believe, at least some of them, that an extra ses sion for the consideration of the tariff schedules would be fatal to 'the Repub licans, because whatever the Democrat ic majority in the house might do would be blocked by the Republican senate. Some of the Republican leaders sav i that an extra session would be fatal 1 to Democrats on the Republican theory ) that the "Democratic party can be counted on to do the wrong thing at ine rjgnt time, ana tnat n tne lanii. schedules are revised the Democrats will make some kind of a blunder. i However, if the Democrats should j force an extra session by a filibuster j I against the appropriation bills the Republicans probably will not he espc- j cially annQyed. Some of the Republican leaders believe that an extra session j will be the one thing needed to insure I Republican success in the 1912 elec- tions. It is indeed seldom that two parties. at the same time, believe that an ex- tra .session will be of advantage to j each. Everything done at the next ses sion will be with an eye single to a ' point of advantage from which the campaign to capture the white house in 1912 can be conducted. It is fully realized that the short session will have the greatest weight in determin ing which party will be victorious in 1912. Democrats Confer. While the Republicans are agitating i the matter of an extra session, they j probably will wait for the Democrats I to make the first move towards that ! end. Leading Democrats are already j conferring on the question of an extra session. Some of the leaders believe that it will be good "politics to force an extra session, by a filibuster, and then bring in a bill to revise the whole tariff downward. Not however, until coneress assembles, will confer ences be held to definitely map out a ' plan of action. Republican leaders are i equally 'active, but both parties will I rest on their oars until the session ac- j tually begins. I Indications now are that an extra i session win oe called, probably to be gin immediately on the adjournment of the regular session on March C. Democratic leaders are counting on the support of insurgent Republican in the special session, if one is called, in the revision of the tariff schedules. Whether they will receive this support is problematical. The Presidents Message. President Taft. who has been work ing on his message to congress for several weeks, had it ready for trans mission as soon as the session opened. ! One of the most important recomrren- I dations in the messace Is susrtrnst ed . legislation changing the anti-trust law so that violators of tn law con ho j punished by imprisonment Snstvid of! nnes.

I That the Democrats intend to lose no ! time in getting ready for 1912 is shown j by the recent call for a meetintr of the national league of Democratic clubs, i which will meet in this city Januarj 9. 1911. Only the executive board of the league, which includes many senators representatives and prominent politi cians will take part in the delibera tionsV but they will have the advice of all Democratic leaders in the house and senate. At the meeting plans will be mapped out for the next two years which will have much effect on the i success of the Democrats in the elec- ! tions irt 1912. Speculate on Nominee. Speculation has begun among mem- t bers of congress as to who will be the Democratic nominee for the presidency , 'n 1912- Three names are before the democrats Wilson. Harmon and Dix. Eacn of7 these will figure prominently ,n tne Democratic convention of 1912.; Harmon, who has been in the public j c-ve .lu,uei ,lMdn l"e otner two pros- j Pective candidates, seems to be favored j by a mairit5" of Democratic senators j and representatives, though Dix is a ; f -nv.-MA -.-A..: Ix-.

They want an extra ses- sion for revision of the house rules; j xne appointment or a committee on committees, and a general reduction in the power of the speaker. On the 1 whole, it is probable, however, if ??amp Clar.k is a.llve the. beginning of the next session, that he will be elected speaker of the house. xi,e wimcrauc caucus
