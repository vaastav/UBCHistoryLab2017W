iisiratlon jf the entin law An ex nunaiion of the law and understanding f 1 th nature of the facts which should 1 onsidered in discharging the func t oiis i iTipOS11 upon the executive show Thai I have the power to direct the tariff bu id to make a comprehensive glossary ii7d 1 encyclopedia of the terms used and iriiclts cmbatd in the tariff law and v > > iure inturniation as to the cost of 1ro < u < lon nf such goods In this country arl the < ot of their production in for i ign countries I have therefore appoint ed a tariff board consisting of three mem is and have directed them to perform nl the duties above described This work Tiii perhaps take two or three xirs ILii I ask from congress a continuing mutual appropriation equal to that al ready made for its prosecution I b lles e that the work of this board will be wU b c prime utility and importance whenever cintjrcss shall deem it wise again to r udjifct the customs duties I the facts bt cured by the tariff board are of such a I character a = to show generally that the rates are excessive under the principles < if protection as described in the platform r the successful party at the late election tin I shall not hesitate to invite the attention 01 congress to this fact and to te necessity for action predicated there I tn Nothing however hal business and Interferes with the course of prosperity go much as the threatened revision of the tat if and until the facts are at hand after careful and deliberate Investigation upon which such revision can properly + be undertaken it seems to me un 4 + wise to attempt it The

make + i 4 an investigation undertaken by it 4 + holy without respect t th effect 4 4 which the facts may have in calling 4 + for a readjustment of the rates of 4 + duty + Economy in the War Department In the interest of iuimoiliata economy and because of the prospect of a de ficit I have required a reduction in the estimates of the war department for the coming fiscal year which brings the total estimate down to an amount < 

OOOA90 less than the corresponding estimates for last year This could only be accomplished by cutting off new projects and suspending for the period Jwjls year all progress in mili tary matters For the same reason 1 have directed that the army shall not he recruited up to its present author led strength These measures can hardly be more than temporary to last until our revenues are In better condi whole of tin i and until the question expediency of adopting a definite mil tary policy can be submitted to con gress for I am sure that the interests of the military establishment are seri ouoly in need of careful consideration Lv congress The law regulating the organization of our armed forces in the went of war need to be revised In or der that the organization can b modi fied so as to produce a force which would be more consistently apportioned throughout its numerous branches To explain the circumstances upon which this opinion is based would necessitate a lengthy discussion and I postpone I until the first convenient opportunity shal arise to send to congress a spe cial message upon this subject + The secretary of war calls at + + tention to a number of needed + + changes in the army in an of 4 4 which I concur but the point 4 4 upon which I place most em + + phasis Is the need for an elimi + + nation bill providing a method by 4 4 which the merits of officers shall 4 have some effect upon their ad 4 4 vancement and by which the ad + + vancement of all may b accel 4 4 erated by the effective elimina 4 + tion of a definite proportion of 4 + the least efficient There are 4 in every army and certainly in ours a number of officers who do not violate their duty in any such way as to give reason for a courtmartial or dismissal but who do not show such aptitude and skill and character for high command as to justify their re maining in the active service to b promoted Provision should be made by which they should be retired on a certain proportion of their pay in creasing with their length ot aorvie at the time of retirement There Is now a personnel law for the navy which itself needs amendment and to which I shall make further refer ence Such a law is needed quite as much for the army Coast Defenses Generally Good The coast defenses of the United States proper are generally all that could b desired and in some respects they are rather more elaborate than under present conditions are needed to stop an enemys fleet from entering the harbors defended There is however one place where additional defense is badlyneeded and that is at the mouth of Chesapeake bay where it is proposed posed to make an artificial Island for a fort which shall prevent an enemys fleet from entering this most Impor tant strategical base of operations on the whole Atlantic and Gulf coasts I hope that appropriate legislation will be adopted to secure the construction of this defense The military and naval joint board have unanimously agreed that it would be unwise to make the large expendi tures which at one time were contem plated in the establishment of 8 naval base and station in the Philippine Is lands and have expressed their Judg ment in which I fully concur in fa vor of making an extensive naval be at Pearl harbor near Honolulu and not in the Philippines This does not dispense with the necessity for the com paratively small appropriations re quired to finish the proper coast de fenses in the Philippines now under construction on the Island of Corregi dor and elsewhere or to complete a suitable repair station and coaling supply station at Olongapo where is the floating dock Dewey I hope that this recommendation of the joint board will end the discussion as to the com parative merits of Manila bay and Olongapo as a naval station and will lead to prompt measures for the prop er equipment and defense of Pearl har bor Efficiency of Navy Proven The return of the battleship fleet from its voyage around the world in more efficient condition than when it started wa a noteworthy event of in terest alike to our citiens and the na val authorities of the world Besides the beneficial and farreaching effect on our personal and diplomatic returns in the countries which the fleet vis ited tne marked success of the ships in steaming around the world in all weathers on schedule time has in creased the respect for our navy and has added to our national prestige Our enlisted personnel recruited from all sections of the country is young and energetic and energetc representa tive of the national spirit I in more over owing to its intelligence capable of quick training into the modern man ofwarsmen Our officers are earnest and zealous in their profession but I is a regrettable fact that the higher officers are old for the responsibilities of the modern navy and the admirals do not arrive at flag rank young enough to obtain adequate training in their duties as flag officers This need for reform in the navy has been ably and earnestly presented to congress by my predecessor and I also predeessor urgently recommend the subject ror considera tion CUDmtcr Reorganization of the Officers Early in the coming session a com prehensive plan for the reorganiatlon of the officers of all corps of the navy will be presented to congress and I hope it will meet with action suited to its urgency Owing to the necessity for etouomr In expenditures I have tuUUIJ curtailment of recommendations for naval appropriations so that they are 38000000 less than the corresponding estimates of last and the etmates year request for new naval construction is limited to two firstclass battleship and one repair vessel Owing to the necessity for economy purposes and there has been found need in the department of a military branch dealing directly with the military tary use of the fleet The secretary of the navy also felt the lack of re sponsible advisers to aid him in reach ing conclusions and decding Important matters between coordinate branches of the department To secure these re sults he has Inaugurated a tentative plan Involving certain changes in the organization of the navy department including the navy yards all of which have been found by the attorney gen eral to be In accordance with law I have approved the execution of the plan proposed because of the greater ef ficiency and economy its promises President Should Appoint Astronomer The generosity of congress has provid ed in the present naval observatory the most magnificent a expensive astron omical establishment In the world I Is being used for certain naval purposes which might easily and adequately b subserved by a small division connected cnnee Wi11 the navy department at only I frac tion of the cost of the present naval ob s i vatory The official board of visitors established t by congress and appointed in 1 > 1 expressd its conclusion that the of ficial head of the observatory should b an eminent astronomer appointed by the President by and with 1h advice aria consent of the senate holding uls place by a tenure at least a permanent as that of the superintendent prmau coast surveyor or the head of the geological survey and not merely by 1 detail r > f two 1 three years duration I fully foncur in this judgment and urge a orovision by law 1 for the appointment of such a director 1 I may not b necessary to tnke the observatory out of the navy deoartment and K put It into another department in which opportunity for scientific research scen fc rfsarh afforded by the observatory would seem to iv more appropriate t ouhh I bel > v sucii a transfer in the long run is I ue 1 ii ht ioi r am Kllrej Aowuer I tx 1 Irs tne desire of the astronomers and those learned in the kindred sciences I when I urge upon congress that the noval observatory b now dedicated to science under control o a man of science who can if need b render all the service to the navy department which this observa tory now renders and still furnish to the world the discoveries in astronomy that a great astronmer using such a plant would b likely to mako Need of Reform i Court Procedure The deplorable delays in the adminis tration of civil and criminal law have re ceived the attention of committees of the American Bar association and at many state bar associations a well as the considered thought of judges an jurists In my judgment a change in judicial pro cedure with a view t reducing its ex pense t private litigants in civil cases and facilitating the dispatch of business and final decision in both civil and crim inal cases constitutes the greatest need ce gotet nee + in our American Institutions I do f + not doubt fo one moment that much muc + of the lawless violence and cruelty i exhibited in lynchings is directly u + to the uncertainties and Injustice I 4 growing out of the delays in trials + judgments and the executions the + of by our courts Of course these 4 remarks apply quite as well to the ad ministration of justice in state courts KB to that in federal courts and without making invidious distinction it i per haps not too much t say that speak ing generally the defects are lees in the federal courts than the state courts But they are great in the federal courts The expedition with which business is dis posed of both in the civil and the crim inal side of English courts under mod era rules of procedure mae the daleys In our courts seem archaic and barbarous The procedure in the fed eral courts should furnish an example fo the state courts I presume eap possible without an amendment 10 the constitution to unite under one form of action the proceedings at common law and proceedings in equity in the federal courts but it t certainly not impossible by a statute to simplify and make short and direct the procedure both at law and In euit In those courts I is not im possible to cut down still more ban I 1 cut down the jurisdiction of the su preme court so a to confine I almost wholly to statutory and constitutional questions Under the present statutes the equity and admiralty procedure in the federal courts is under the control > f the supreme court but in the pressure of bu mess to which that court is subjected I is impossible to hope that a radlsal and proper reform of the federal equity pro cedure can b brought about I ther fore recommend legislation providing ro the appointment by the President of a commission with authority to examine the law and equity procedure of the federal CUr of first instance the law of ap peals from these courts to the courts of appeals and to the supreme court and the costs imposed in such procedure upon the private litigants and upon th pub lic treasury and make recommendation with a view to simplifying and expediting simplfin RO the procedure as far as possible and k In i a inexpensive pb b to h litigant of little means Party Platform on Injunctions The platform of the successful party in the last election contained the following + The Republican party will uphold = 4 at all times the authority and In + p tegrity of the courts state and fed 4 eral and will ever insist that their i 4 powers to enforce their process and + to protect life liberty and property i shall b preserved Inviolate We be i lieve however that the rules of procedure in the federal courts with respect to the issuance of the writ te H of injunction should b more ac curately defined by statute and that 4 no injunction or temporary restrain ing order should b issued without 4 notice except where irreparable In o Jury would arise from delay In which t < case a speedy hearing thereafter 4 should spy + I recomend that in compliance with the proml thus made appropriate legisla tion b adopted The ends of justice will best b met and the chief cause of com plaint against illconsidered injunctions without notice will b removed by the enactment of a statute forbidding here after the issuing of any injunction or re straining order whether temporary or permanent by any federal court without previous notice and a reasonable oppor tunity t b heard on behalf of the par ties to b enjoined unless I shall ap pear to the satisfaction of the court that pr t cu lht the delay necessary to give such nntlfce and harIng would result In irreparable injury to the complainant and unless flso the court shall from the evidence make a written finding which shall b spread upon the court minutes that immediate and irreparable injury I likely t ensue to the complainant and shall define the Injury state why I 1 Irreparable and shall also endorse on the order issued the date and the hour ot the issuance of the order Moreover every such injunc tion 01 restraining order issued without previous notice a opportunity by the defendant to b heard should by force of The statute expire and b of no effect after seven days from the issuance thereof or within any time less than that period which the court may fix unleee within such even days or such lees period that InjuncUon or order I extended or renewed newed after previous notice and oppor oppr tunity t b heard My judgment is that the passage of such an act which really embodied the best practice in equity and is very like the rule now in force In some courts wU prevent the issuing of ill advised orders of injunction without notice and will render such orders when Issued much less objectionable by the short time in which they may remain effective Special Message Will Come Later The jurisdiction of the general gov ernment over Interstate commerce h been left to the passage of the cUed Sherman antitrust law and the in terstate commerce law and its amend ments The developments In the ment opera I tion of these laws as shown by indict in t trials judicial decisions and other sources of Information call for a discussion and some suggestions as t amendment These I prefer to em body in a special message instead of including them in the present com munication and I shall avail myself of the first convenient opportunity to bring these subjects to the attention of the congress District Jail a Living Reproach My predecessor transmitted to the congress a special message on January 1 1909 accompanying the report of commissioners theretofore appointed to Investigate the jan workhouse etc in the District of Columbia in which he directed attention to the report as set ting forth vividly the really outrage ous conditions in the workhouse and jail jailThe congress has taken action in pursuance of the recommendations of that report and of the President to the extent of appropriating funds and en acting the necessary legislation for the establishment of a workhouse and re formatory No action however has been taken by the congresa with re spect to the Jail the conditions of which are still antiquated and unsani tary I earnestly recQmmend the pas sage of a sufficient appropriation to enable a thorough remodeling of that institution to be made without delay I is a reproach to the national gov ernment that almost under the shadow of the capitol dome prisoners should be confined in a building destitute of the ordinary decent appliances requisite to cleanliness and sanitary conditions Secondclass Mail Matter The deficit every year In the post office department Is largely caused by the low rate of postage of one cent a pound charged on secondclass mal matter which Includes not only news papers but magazines and mlscellane + ous periodicals The actual loss 4 + growing out of the transmission + 4 of this secondclass mall matter 4 4 at one cent a pound amounts to 4 + about 63000000 a year The aver 4 + age cost of the transportation 4 4 ot tiiia matter is more than nine + + cents a pound + It appears that the average distance J over which newspapers are delivered to their customers is 291 miles while the average haul of magazines Is 1049 and of miscellaneous periodicals 1128 miles a Thus the average haul of the maga zine is three and onehalf times and that of the miscellaneous periodical is nearly four times the haul of the daily newspaper yet all of them pay the same postage rate of one cent a pound The statistics of 1907 show that secondclass mal matter constituted 391 per cent of the weight of all the mail and yielded only 519 per cent of the revenue The figures given are startling and show the payment by the government of an enormous subsidy to the news papers magazines and periodicals and congress may well consider whether radical steps should not be taken to reduce the deficit in the postoffice de partment caused by this discrepancy between the actual cost of transporta tion and the compensation exacted therefor The total deficit for the last fiscal year in the postoffice department amounted to ptofice 17500000 The branches of Its business which i did at a loss were the second class mail service in which the loss as already said was 63000000 and the free rural delivery in which the loss was 28 000000 These losses were in part offset by the profits of the letter postage and other sources of income I would seem wise to reduce the loss upon secondclass mall matter at least to the extent of preventing venting a deficit in th total operations of the postoffice department A great saving might be made amounting to much more than half of the loss by imposing upon magazines and periodicals a higher rate of post age They are much heavier than newspapers and contain a much higher proportion of advertising to reading matter and the average distance of their transportation is three and a half times as great I recommend the whole subject to congress not unmindful of the spread of intelligence which a low charge for carrying newspapers and periodicals assists I very much doubt however the wisdom of a policy which consti tutes so large a subsidy and requires additional taxation to meet It Postal Savings I Banks Desired The second subject worthy of men tion in the postoffice department Is the real necessity and entire prac ticability of establishing postal savings banks The successful party at the last election declared in favor of postal savings banks and although the propo sition finds opponents in many parts o the country I am convinced that the people desire such banks and am sure that when the banks are furnished they will be productive of the utmost goo The postal savings banks are not constituted for the purpose of creating competition with other banks The rate of interest upon deposits to which they would be limited would b so small as to prevent their drawing deposits away from other banks I believe them to be necessary in order to offer a proper inducement to thrif and saving to a great many peo ple of email means who do not now have banking facilities and to whom such a system would offer an oppor 4 tunity for the accumulation of 4 + capital They will furnish a satis + + factory substitute based on sound + + principles and actual successful 4 + trial in nearly all the countries of 4 4 the world for the system of gov 4 4 ernment guaranty of deposits now 4 4 being adopted In several western 4 4 states which with deference to + 4 those who advocate f seems to + 4 me to have in it the seeds of de 4 4 moralization to conservative + + banking and certain financial dis + 4 aster 4 The question o how the money de posited in postal savings banks shall be Invested is not free from difficulty but I believe that a satisfactory provi sion for this purpose was inserted as an amendment to the bill considered by the senate at its last session I has been proposed to delay the con sideration of legislation regarding pos tal savings banks until after the re port of the monetary commission This report is i likely to be delayed and properly so because of the necessity for careful deliberation and close In vestigation I do not see why the one should be tied up with the other I is understood that the monetary com mission has looked Into the systems of banking which now prevail abroad and have found that by a control there exercised In respect to reserves and the rates of exchange by some central authority conflicts are avoided I is not apparent that 1 system of postal savings banks would in any way in terfere with a change to such a system here Certainly in most Of the coun tries in Europe where control is thus exercised by a central authority postal savings banks exist and are not thought to be inconsistent with a proper financial and banking system Earnest Plea for Merchant Marine Following the course of my distin guished predecessor I earnestly rec ommend to congress the consideration and passage of a ship subsidy bill looking to the establishment of lines between our Atlantic seaboard and the eastern coast of South America and well a lines from the west coast of the United States to South America China Japan and the Philippines Toe profits on foreign mails are perhaps a sufficient measure of the expenditures which might first be tentatively ap I plied to this method of Inducing Amer ican capital to undertake the estab I lishment of American lines of steam ships in those directions in which we now feel it most important that we should have of means transportation tion controlled in the interest of ex pansion of our trade A bill of this character has once passed the house and more than once passed the senate and I hope that at this session a bill framed on the same lines and with the same purposes may become a law Statehood for the Territories The successful party in the last election in its national platform de clared in favor of the admission as separate states of New Mexico and Ari zona and I recommend that legisla tion appropriate to this end be adopted I urge however that care be exercised in the preparation of the legislation af fecting each territory to secure delib eration in the selection of persons as members of the convention to draft a constitution for the incoming state and I earnestly advise that such con stitution after adoption by the conven tion shall b submitted to the people of the territory for their approval at an election in which the sole issue shall be the merits of the proposed consti tution and If the constitution is de feated by popular vote means shall be provided In the enabling act for a new convention and the drafting of a new constitution I think It vital that the lsiie as to the merits of the constitution tution should not be mixed up with the selection of state offices and that no election of state offices should be had until after the constitution had been fully approved and finally set tled upon Government of Alaska With respect to the territory of Alas I ka I recommend legislation which shall provide for the appointment by the President of a governor and also of an executive council the members of which shall during their term of of fice reside in the territory and which shall have legislative powers sufficient to enable It to give to the territory local laws adapted to its locl Is present growth I strongly deprecate legisla tion looking to the election of a ter ritorial legislature in that vast district The lack of permanency of residence of a large part of the present popula tion and the small number of the peo ple who either permanently or tem porarily reside in the district as coin pared with its vast expanse and the variety of the interests that have to be subserved make I altogether un fitting in my judgment to provide for a popular election of 1 legislative body The present system Is not adequate and does not furnish the character of local control that ought to be there The only compromise ft seems to me which may give needed local legisla tion and secure a conservative govern men is one I propose Conservation of Resources In several departments there Is pre sented the necessity for legislation looking to the further conservation of i our national resources and the sub ject is one of such importance as to require a more detailed and extended discussion than can be entered upon in this communication For that reason I shall take an early opportunity to send a special message to congress on the subject of the Improvement of our waterways upon the reclamation and irrigation of arid semiarid and swamp lands upon the preservation of our forests and the reforesting of suitable areas upon the reclassification of the public domain with a view of separat ing from agricultural settlement min eral coal and phosphate lands and sites belonging to the government bor dering on streams fiitaMe for the uil ization of water power I comment to yiMir careful ClnMder atlon the report of the creisiry of agriculture as showing the immense sphere of usefulness which that de I i partment now fills and the wonderful addition to the wealth of the nation made by the farmer of this country in the crop of the current year Work of Lighthouse Board I The lighthouse board now discharges its duties under the department of commerce and labor For upward of forty years this board has bee con stituted of military and naval of leers and two or three men of science with such an absence of a duly constituted executive board that i is marvelous what work has been accomplished In the period of construction the energy and enthusiasm of all the members prevented the inherent defects of the system from Interfering greatiy wan the beneficial work of the board but now that the work is chiefly confined to maintenance and repair for which purpose the country Is divided into sixteen districts to which are assigned an engineer officer of the army and an inspector of the navy each with a lighthouse tender and the needed plant for his work i has become apparent by the frequent friction that arises due to the absence of any central in dependent authority that there must be a complete reorganiatlon of the board I concede the advantage of keeping in the system the dignity of discipline that the presence of naval and military officers in charge insures but unless the presence of such offi cers in the board can be made con sistent with a responsible executive head that shall have proper authority I recommend the transfer of control over the lighthouses to a suitable civil ian bureau This is in accordance with the judgment of competent per sons who are familiar with the work ings of the present system I am confident that a reorganization can be effected which shall avoid the recur rence of friction between members in stances of which have been officially brought to my attention and by such reorganization greater efficiency and a substantial reduction in the expense of operation can b brought about I request congress for authority to enable the secretary of commerce and I labor to unite the bureaus of manu factures and statistics This was rec ommended by a competent committee appointed in the previous administra tion for the purpose of suggesting changes in the Interest of efficiency and Is requested by the secretary Swift and Sure Penalty Advised I greatly regret to have to say that the Investigations made in the bureau of immigration and Other sources of infor mation lead to tbe view that there is urgent necessity for additional legislation and greater executive activity to sup press the recruiting of the ranks of pros titutes from the streams of immigration into this country an evil which for want Of a better name ha been called the white slave trade I believe i to b constitutional to forbid under penalty the transportation of persons for purposes of prostitution across national and state lines and by obtaining a fund of SO to b used by the secretary of commerce and labor for the employment of special inspectors it will be possible to bring those responsible for this trade to indict ment and conviction under a federal law Need of Public Health Bureau For a very considerable period a move ment has been gathering strength espe daily among the members of the medical profession in favor of a concentration of the instruments of the national govern ment which have to do with the promo tion of public health In the nature of things th medical department of the army and the medical department of the navy must b kept separate But there seems to b no reason why all the other bureaus and offices in the general gov ernment which have to do with the pub lic health and subjects akin thereto should not bo united in a bureau to he called the bureau of public health This would necessitate the transfer o tie marine hospital service to such a bureau mune a aware tbat there is a wide field In respect to the public health committed to the states in which the federal gov ernment cannot exercise jurisdiction but we have seen In the agricultural de partment the expansion into wide use fulness of a department giving attention to agriculture when that subject is plain ly one over which the states properly ex ercis direct jurisdiction Th ° opportuni ties offered for useful research and the spread of useful Information In regard to the cultivation of the soil and the breed Ing of stock and the solution of many of the intricate problems in progressive ag riculture have demonstritiii th wisdom of establishing that dfpartm Similar reasons of equal force can be given fr the establishment of a bureau I of lieaUh that shall not only exercise the police jurisdiction of the federal government r I specting quarantine but which shall a afiord an opportunity for Investigate and research by competent experts no questions of health affecting the wh < > > country or important sections there i questions which in the absence of tv era government work a D likely iu b promptly solved Civil Service Commission The work of t United Hates chI service commission bas been performed to the general satisfaction of the executive officers with which the commission has been brought
