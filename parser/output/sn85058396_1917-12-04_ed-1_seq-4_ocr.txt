A MOTHER'S LETTER TO THE STANDARD . No greater burden is borno during this war than that intiicteu on me mothers, and, therefore, The Standard prints with admiration this letter- of fortitude and prayerful composure ad dressed to us by an Ogden mother who has made her sacrifice: Dear Standard: A mother thinks much has been said con cerning the great problem of .the 'day, the war. Our conversations, newspapers, .magazines, sermons and prayers are filled with the thought, but, after all has been said and done, it seems to me the mothers of the human race have to pay the bill. We pass over the long, weary days, weeks and months of anxi ety and suffering before the birth of a child, and later cling to the rollicking, noisy, freckled-faced boy. God only knows what a mother can see in a troublesome youngster,- but she sees much, and dreams and plans accordingly. She bends her tired, aching back day and night, in labor and sickness, caring for her boy, and there is no time but she would give her life for her child. After she has given . the best years of her life to her children, has tried to train and .educate them in the proper way, and after the boys have arrived at - the age of from 20 to 30 years the . finished product so far as she is concerned the old gray-haired mother must stand and sec them march by, to "somewhere" be a target! However, it seems the war was inevitable and could not bo avoid ed. The time has arrived for all of us to bo loyal to our president He was forbearing, enduring and has added patience to patience, in the grandeur and magnificence of his nature. He had no desire for a slaughter pen, if it could bo honor ably avoided. Amid the jibes, in sults, ahuse and cartoons, lin slnnrl squarely on the pedestal of right, and now, if I may, I would ask a righteous blessing on the rulers of this great .earth, together with the people they represent, trusting Almighty God will grant us the eternal blessing of peace on earth and good will toward men, . nn .

PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE- We are pleased with President Wil son's message to congress. His decla ration in favor of making war on Aus tria will meot with general approval, as the great majority of the people have not fully understood why Austria Hungary should not hav9 been includ ed in the state-of-war pronounced upon Germany in April last. Obviously in response to the taunts of the pro-Germans, the president an swers the questions as to why the United States is at war and what are the ultimate aims of our fighting forces, and his rojoinder Is powerful. No part of his message Is a stronger appeal' to American patriotism than ! his declaration that this country will remain in the war until the German people are made to respect the rights of others and the world Is freed from the" menace of the militarism of the German plotters. President Wilson warns the Ger mans they are in danger of. lasting ostracism' by the free people of the world. He points out the possibility of the allies forming a commercial pact which will exclude the Germans, if they persist In attempting military domination. This threat of ovenlual ly reducing the Teutons to the level of outcasts If they persist in their out rageous attitude, should make more than one Gorman overlord squirm. Evidently the president has not lost hope of separating Turkey from Ger man control, a he places Turkey and Bulgaria in the class of misled victims of Germany. The big note in the president's mes sage is the resolve to turn the whole energy of the nation to the winning of tho war; although almost as im portant is his urging of penitentiary sentences for alien enemies who vio late tho rules of conduct which have j been prescribed for them during this war. 00 NO 

EXEMPTIONS FOR REGISTRANTS Within the next few days, hun dreds of young men, married and sin gle, living in Ogtlen will receive the "questionnaire." They are part of the army of 0,000,000 registrants In the United States. On the first page of the questionnaire will be found the name qi the registrant, his serial and order numbers, telephone call and ad dress, and- Just below this introduc tion will appear this notice: "You are requested by law to return this questionnaire filled out In accordance with instructions contained herein within seven days from date of this notice. Fail ure to do so is a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprison ment for one year and may result . in the loss of valuable rights and in". Immediate induction into mili tary service." On Monday Provost Marshal Gen eral Crpwder issued a statement that no man will be granted exemption fronr the draft because he has depend ents, saying: "War must . bring inconveniences and sacrifices to all. The selective service law' exepapts no person from military service on the ground pf de pendency. The reclassification scheme is designed to defer the Induotlon into the army of registrants upon whom other persons are mninly dependent for support until after persons without actual dependents have been called." "The military needs of the nation require that there be provided in ev ery community a list of names of men who shall be ready to be called into service att any time. The economic needs of the nation, while deferring to the paramount military necessity, re quire that men whose removal would Interfere with civic, family, Industrial and agricultural institutions of the na tion, shall be tdken in the order in which they can best be spared. For this reason the names of all men lia ble to selection are to be arranged in five classes in the inverse order of their importance to the economic in teresfs of the nation, which Include th.e maintenance of necessary industry and agriculture and the support of de pendents. "Section 4 of the selection service law exempts no person from military service on the ground of dependency. The present scheme Is devised by tho creation of several classes, arranged in tho order of their availability for military service, to defer the induc tion into the army of the registrants upon whom other persons are mainly dependent for support until persons without actual -dependents have been called. "While an actual dependency must be established before any kind of dis charge can be granted, there are cer tain conditions of dependency which it Is advisable to recognize to a full er extent than others. "The present classification is de signed to afford the maximum of pro tection to dependent relatives consis tent with the military necessity of the nation." Young men who were under age when tho draft was ordered, but have since reached 21 years, may be relieved- of uncertainty by tho follow ing declaration: J, Desplto the agitation in congres- slonal and other governmental circles to bring under the draft the class of men who have reached the age of 21 since June 5 last and make accessible the classos of 20 and 19, thereby guar anteeing the practical exemption of married men with dependent families, it was indicated officially yesterday that the war departments would op pose any extension of the draft until the present registered men have been "used up." To bring in one or more tho present machinery and the new classification, both of which were carefully prepared and worked out, it was slated. . on . 

UNITED STATES NAVY IS SECOND Repeatedly The Standard has been roquested to state the comparative strength of the American and Ger man navies. Since the opening of the war it has been almost Impossible to get any accurate information on the German naval forces. Today no one, outside the inner circle of Germany's military advisers, can state with cer tainty the losses to tho Germans at iho battle of Jutland. But it Is gener ly conceded by well-informed authori ties that the Teutons have not been able to keep up their naval construc tion of capital ships, for nearly all their ship-building energy has been de voted to submarine production. On August i, 1914, the United States had 12 dreadnoughts in commission to Gormany's 22. In the Jutland engage ment the Germans, are said to have lost three large ships. Germany's 19. The Scientific American places the United States navy second in naval power, with the completion of the war ships started before war was declared. Wo shall have 25 dreadnoughts to Ger many's 22, and G battle cruisers to her 5, in addition to a destroyer fleet the largest in the world. When war broke out, the United States had under construction 5 super dreadnoughts of 32,000 tons each, car rying twelve 14-inch guns and plans were made for four ships of 32,500 Ions with eight 16-inch guns, and four warships of 40,000 tons, carrying 16 inch guns and six 35-knot 35,000-ton battle cruisers, with ten 7,500-ton 35 knot scouts. When the Spanish-American war nrnn (ho nlrl Drnrnn rr c rmn nf nnr largest and most powerful warships, i At that time the British had the Ma 'jestic, Magnificent and the Illustrious, which were the pride of all English j men. These battleships were of 14,900 tons displacement and carried four 12 j inch guns. Our newest vessel of 40, ; 000 tons, with twelve 16-inch guns, haying a range of 16 miles, could have destroyed the finest warships of Great Britain3 and . never have been within range of the British guns. One most remarkable feature of our new ships is the speed. Vessels of 35,000 tons can make 35 knots an hour. To do this requires 1S0.OO0 horse-power. Great Britain had under construc tion at the beginning of the war ten super-dreadnaughts of 27,500 tons and had just completed the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth. Tho Queen Elizabeth took part in the bom bardment of the forts of Gallipoll, us ing her eight 15-inch guns. But all those ships are small compared with the 10,000-ton fighting machines which the United States has under way. j oo IJongress Urged tc Devote Energies to War (Continued from page 1.) American Attitude Unchanged. From every point of view, thorofore, it has seemed to be my duty to speak these declarations of purpose, to add must; oijuuiiii' nm;ijiuiiuiuiio iu wnai I took the liberty of saying to the sen ate in January. Our entrance Into the war has not altered our attitude to wards the settlement that must come when it is over. When I said in Jan uary that the nations of the world were entitled not only to free paths upon the sea, but also to assured and unmolested access to those pathways I was thinking, and I am thinking now, not of the smaller and weaker nations alone, which need our countenance and support, but also of the great and powerful nations, and of our present enemies as well as our present associ ates in the war. I was thinking, and am thinking now of Austria herself, among the rest, as well as of Serbia and of Poland. Justice and equality of rights can be had only at a great price. Wo are seeking permanent, not tem porary, foundations for the peace of the world and must seek them can didly and fearlessly, as always the right will prove to be the expedious. What shall we do then to push this groat war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all impediments to success and we must make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a fighting unit. One very cmbarraslng obstacle that stands in our way is that we are at war with Germany but not wtih hor al-lies- I therefore very earnestly recom mend that the congress immediately declare the United States in. a state of war with Austria-Hungary. Docs it seem strange to you that this should be the conclusion of the argument I have just addressed to you? It is not. It is In fact the inevitable logic of what I have said. Austria-Hungary is, for the time being, not her own mis tress but simply the vassal of the Ger man government. She must face the facts as they are and act upon them without sentiment in this stern busi ness. Tho government of Austria Hungary is not acting upon its own in-, Itiative or in response to the wishes . and feelings of its own people's, but ! as tho instrument of another nation. ; We must meet its forco with our own and regard the central powers as but one. The war can be successfully con ducted In no other way. The same log ic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria They also are tho tools of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand in the direct path of our neces sary action. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, but It seoms to mo that we should go only whore immedlato and practical . considerations lead us and not heed any others. The financial and military measures which must be adopted will suggest themselves as the war and its under takings develop, but I will take the lib orty of proposing to you certain other acts of legislation which seem to mo to be needed for the support of tho war and for the release of our whole force and energy. Alien Enemy Laws. It will be necessary to extend in cer tain particulars the legislation of the last session with regard to alien ene mies; and also necessary, I believe to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance and depar ture of all persons Into and from the United States. Legislation should he enacted defin ing as a criminal offense every willful violation of tho presidential proclama tions relating to alien enemies promul gated under section 4067 of the revised statutes and providing appropriate punishments; and women as well as men. should be included in the terms of the act placing restrictions upon alien enemios. It Is likely that as time goes on many alien enemies will bo willing to bo fed and housed af the expense of tho government in the de tention camps and it would be the pur purpose of the legislation I have sug gested to confine offenders among them in penitentiaries and other simi lar institutions where they could be made to work as other criminals do. Limits to Prices. Recent experience has convinced me that the congress must go further In authorizing the governmont to sot lim its to prices. The law of supply and demand, I am sorry to say, has boon replaced by the law of unrestrained selfishness. Whilo we have eliminat ed profiteering in several branches of industry it still runs impudently ram pant In others. The farmers, for ox ample, complain with a groat deal of justice that, while the regulation of food prices restricts their Incomes, no restraints are placed upon the prices of most of the things they must them selves purchaso and similar inequities obtain on all sides. Use of Water Power. It is imperatively necessary that the consideration of tho full use of the waterpowcr of the country and also the consideration of the systematic and yet economical development of nutii ui me natural resources of thp country as are still under control of the federal government should bo im mediately rosumed and iffarmatively and constructively dealt with at the earliest possible moment. The press ing need of such legislation is daily becoming mom obvious. The legislation proposed at tho last session with regard to regulated com binations among our exporters, in order to provide for our foreign trade a more effective organization and method of co-operation, ought by all means to be completed at this session. Appeals to House. And I beg that tho members of the house of reprosenUUlves will permit me to express the opinion that it will be impossible to deal in any wav but a very wasteful and extra vagRnt fash ion with the onormous appropriations of tho public monies, which must con tinue to be mado If the war is to be properly sustained, unless the house will consent to return to its former practice of initialing and preparing all appropriation bills through a single committee in order thai responsibility may bo centered, expenditures stand ardized and made uniform and waste and duplication, as much as possible avoided. ' Railroad Transportation Problem. Additional legislation may also be come necessary before the present congress adjourns In order to affect the lost officlent co-ordination and op eration of the railway and other trans portation systems of the country; but to that I shall, if circumstances should demand, call tho attenion of congress upon another occasion. If I have overlooked anything that ought to be done for tho more effective conduct of the war, your own counsels will supply the omission. What I am perfectly cloar about is that in the present session of the congress our whole attention and energy should be concentrated on the vigorous and !
