The secret of It is largely this: the proprietor seeks far and wide through the region tor wom en who have a reputation for making aome single dish.

The shrewd hotel keeper offers these women a handsome sum of money to fry chicken and make doughnuts and pandowdy for six weeks for his for tunate guests. So superiority again •finds its market and its praise. Ambi- to excel Is good comrrfon sense. A great king may boild -himself a monu ment designed to eclipse all other royal mofiuments. A rich man may try to roll up a fortune bigger by millions than other fortunes. But neither king nor millionaire can become exclusive possessor of the rewards of superior ity. Good, plain work superlatively well done fits into the scheme of the universe. It makes the world richer, by contributing its share to that per fection which is civilization's constant quest •tmV'.?•-• American Gastronomy. It Is generally recognized that the digestive organs of the American are fearfully and wonderfully made. In no respect is this more apparent than In the consumption of so-called "sea food," from the Atlantic seaboard to the Mississippi valley. The Chicagc epicure may be forgiven for liking Cape Cods and Blue Points opened a thousand miles from tidewater. But among the strangers who sojourn in New York hotels .and dine in New York restaurants, the is an unhal lowed taste for fish which should either disgust the ea AT or Induce ptomaine poisoning, oj both. Weak fish, When served under the alias of "sea trout," are devoured by visiters from the west, in season and out, whether softened by hot sun or hard ened and spoiled by cold storage. The wise man, disregarding all the timo honored warnings, knows that he may eat his fill of lobsters and crabs, and may even wash them down with milt, provided they were alive when cooked. But not all the digestive tablets ic America can act as antidote to bluo fish which have been dead for days in the hold of a smack, or have been laid out in tbe arctic atmosphere of a cold storage plant, to be resurrected after several moons have waxed and wanecL A. good sauce may (temporarily) con ceal the fact that fish cannot be em balmed. So, says the New York Post, we suppose tbe Bostonian will go on eating red snappers from the Gulf of Mexico, while the Galveston gourmet enjoys "live cod" beneath a tropical ton. v. A "Burning" Subject, ews Prof. Flux, who has jost edited new mpj' SL 4 bJs-+ edition of Jevons' "Coal Ques tion," first published 40 years ago, shows that that writer has been much misunderstood, and generally reas sures the British public as to the day when It must do without coaL The rate of increase of coal cosumption during the last 20 years Prof. Flux proves to have been materially less than during tbe preceding 20. But this diminution is not constant, as the Increase was slower In the decade 1885-94 than in the decade following. The average annual increase Prof. Flux nets at two per cent. If the pres ent rate of Increase Is maintained till 1954 tbe total output a year will then be 669 millions of tons, according to the London Tribune. As there is a visible supply of 100,000 millions of tons, with a probable, as yet un proved, supply of 40,000 millions more, four-fifths of the former will still be intact in 1954. So that even the great grandchildren of the present genera tion will not feel that the danger of a coal less hearth is pressing.

IOWA COUNTY OFFICIAL SUICIDES. Faced Thirty-three Indictments For Kmbuztemsnt.

Re was to have been brought into court that morning to face no- less than thirty-three indictments for forgery, embezzlement and larceny of road funds.

In spite of this he was allowed by officials to spend the niglit In his own home. Prelster arose early In the morning and went out to the barn as usual. Some time elapsed and then members of his family, growing alarmed, went,! 5*es* out for him." A dreadful sight awaited inside- the barn. He lay there with his tUru&x cut deep and wide and the blood streaming forth. Prti3ter was found by his wife in the haymow of the barn. She had gone oft to the barn to get coal ana discovered blood upon the chunks she was shoveling. On going up in the haymow, from whence the blood evidently came, she discovered the body of her husband. FREE HUGH SLOAN Van Buren County Judge's Son V/'i's in Suit.

Th« senate, yesterday llstehed to the seo ond speech Which has been made thlj session against* the continuance ot Reed Smoot as senator from Utah. It waq delivered by Senator Dubois of Idaho, who after reviewing in de tail the workings of the Mormon ohurch and Mr, Smoot's prominent connection therewith, concluded with the charge that President Roosevelt iiad used the weight of his adminis tration to assist the republican Mor mon vote in the last election. ^"The address was of considerable length, the first portion belag devot ed to a review of the Mormon church., Dubois asserted that polygamous marriages were still being contracted, although surreptitiously, and that an aristocracy of polygamists was being built up by the church officials who now arrange and select these polyga mous marriages. But no record oi polygamous marriages Is kept which is available for the American people. Because of thi3, he pointed out, the futility of passing a national law hibiting the practice. As to Senator Smoot, he declared, it made no difference whether he wa^ or was not a polygamisu "Smoot," he said, "represents tha church -and net thfe state and would do the bidding of the chu-rch before he would serve the real interests of tha state or of the nation. Turning his attention to* the cam paign preceding the recent election, Mr. Durbois read the pr6ss dispatches of Oct. 22, which stated the president hid ^ent Secretary Taft into Idaho to speak in adovcacy of law and order. At that time Mr. Dubois said he had telegraphed the president that the only Issue In Idaho was the desire of the Mormon hierarchy to continue to dominate the politics of the state, and that the president had been misled if he thought there wka any other issue. "I call attention to these messages of the presidents for two purposes, one to indicate the views of our form er executives, the other to mark the contrast between them and the pres ent occupant of the White House. Mormonism is inore insidious, more dangerous and' a greater menace to our government and civilization today "The non-Mormon citizenship of Utah and of Idaho think they are en titled to the support of law abiding citizens everywhere in their efforts to maintain American citizenship in these Mormon states, and If they can not receive that, they have the right to demand that the president of the United States shall not use the great power vested in him in the interest of those law defying and wi-American organizations in their determination to rule the politics of this section of our country," 

QUITS REFORM SPELLING. President Will Withdraw Order .to Public Printer. Washington, D. C., Dec. 14.—Presi dent Roosevelt will withdraw his sim plified spelling order to the public printer and hereaftc all documents from the executive departments will, again be printed In the old fashioned style. Representative Landls of the Joint committee on spelling had a con ference* yesterday with the president, v/hen the president said he did not wish to have spelling overshadow matters of great Importance, and ex pressed a willingness to revoke his order for the new spelling in case the house of representatives should go on record as opposing the system. Accordingly, late this afternoon, Mr. Landis introduced the following reso lution in the house: "Resolved, That it is the sentiment •A. the house of representatives that Hereafter In presenting reports, docu ments, or other publications author ized by law, ordered. by congress or either' branch thereof, or emanating Vom the executive departments their bureaus 'or branches, and indpendent •ffices of the government^ the govern ment printing office should observe and adhere to the standard of orthog raphy prescribed in generally accept ed dictionaries of the English lan guage." The measure was passed without a dissenting vote, although Mr. Gtllett of Massachusetts, who made a fight for simplified spelling before the house committee on appropriations' and has been regarded as the cham pion of the president's attitude, ex plained that he did not wish to give the impression that he had changed his mind. Mr. Glllett said he saw that the house was overwhelmingly against the innovation and consequently he bo*'*(| to'Its-will. Ylifc system of reform" spelling was put into enect by the .president during the recess of congress, and all pu-bllc documents supplied to the executive departments have been printed In tbe simplified way. These' documents have teen pouring in on congres since the opening day, much to the dissatisfaction of a large majority' of the members of .the house. As a result the- government printing office was using two forms of spelling in public printing, the staid old method for congress and the reformed method' in the executive documents. This caused a confusion and continent unfavorable to the reform, and finally was made an Issue between the legislative de partment having previously frowned upon tfct president's order,
