Jor.es :n the Tvw::; r ' C..'::va' r.r'j Last month attention was called to ]' the importance of supplying animals, { in winter, with wann water and arm L food. It v;.i> suggested fir i water be , brought from spring?, in underground ' c pipes, directly'into the stalls, when- * ever this was practicable, i?ui as this : j cannot be done on many farms, we ; ( suggest another arrangement. which ; ( i- practicable on every larm. A force pump may be placed in the barn or t stable with pipe running from it lo a , well near by. With such arrange- \ incut, the farmer without exposure, ; and without taking his animate from , their stalls, could supply them with , iresh, warm water, by pipes running j from the pump to drinking vessels in each stall. The pipe, leading lo the well, should be sunk deep enough in the ground lo cscape freezing in the ; coldest weather. How quickly, how easily, how pleasantly could slock be : supplied with fresh, warm water iti winter, and cool, fresh water in summer. The first outlay would be soon returned in the saving* of time and labor in taking animal* in and out of their stalls. Irregularity in feeding and watering lays the foundation for much of the sickness of stock. Ar-j range everything, therefore, about i barn and stable with reference to great- j est convenience and dispatch. The j easier a thing can be done, the more! cerisitily oi* its being done. Rainy weather usually sets in this j month and continues during the win-; ter. If slock has been allowed the vim t'm *irr>.-? afnri ! it at once. There is 110practice in ouv i'arming more short-sighted than allowing stock to tramp the \vet ileitis during winter. Pretty much everything of value as food has been gleaned already; the stock will get little or jiothing, but they will damage the land greatly. The land is entitled to all the debris of the crop. Don't be so snortsighted as to try to get everything out i of it at once. iiemember the story of the goose that laid the golden egg.! Moreover, it is true economy, as well j as kindness to stock, to keep them out of the coid rains. The little gleanings j they get will not produce more animal! heat than that which exposure to cold rains will take from their bodies In other words, the animals will gain nothing, the tields wili lose their vegetable matter and the soil its friability. In ail the more thickly settled portions of the country we have passed beyond the mixed pastoral and farming state, and have "reached the farming state proper. Our policy now is to provide ; special pastures and raise food for all the stock kept on the farm. This must j become, as much as any other, an or-: ganized, well-developed part of our: farm economy, ^cc "how readily and quickly it assumes this shape on the stock farm- scattered over the country. Owners of Jerseys?who attach j value to their stock?very soon have good pastures and unlimited supplies of forage. It only requires that one should make up his mind to have them. "With Bermuda grass, red, white and burr clovers, lucern and 5Danish cio- : ver, orchard, herds and blue grasses, barley, rye, German millet, sorghum, pea vines and drilled corn; why should j one ever be at a loss in providing for his stock? With so many available crops, supplemented by an unlimited supply of I cotton seed and a mild, genial climate superadded, why should not Southern farmers raise more stock? Why should ? a mule or a horse ever be brought from the north side of the Ohio river? Why i should hundreds of tons of butter and oleomargarine from the Xorth i be sold in Die South every year?; Why work ourselves to death to: raise cotton to buy horses, mules, j bacon, tlour, lard, meal, glucose or i starch syrup when every one of these, except the glucose, which can be supplanted by sorghum syrup, can be raised at home without' the slightest. difficulty! Why play into the hands ; of middlemen, railroads, banks, speculators, etc., to say nothing of the dependence upon the unsteady, unreliable ; laborers in our midst? You say cotton is always salable, always brings cash, j So does first-class butter, so does1 bacon, so does lard, so does a good I mule or horse. Jersey butter linds ready sale simply because in is good ' butter. The owners of such stock I make butter in a business-like way; i they have good milk-houses and! proper arrangements for cooling and ; keeping rniikT water power or some ! other mechanical device for churning. i JL AiV * ViV i*V/L Hi tWi >V VJiilller and pour hot water in the churn; they know that slow churning makes the most and the best butler. They know that large feeds of cotton seed spoil butter, and they feed something else. It ail of our farmers handled their milk and butter in like manner, Northern butter would soon be driven out of the market. In the olden time, the little surplus butter on our farms was regarded as a trifle, and little attention given it. Hence, we have .? fallen into careless ways and methods ?let us change them. Let every farmer arrange to make some butter : for market?handle it properly, make > its quality good and its appearance j attractive and he will always find: ready sale at good prices. ifl this connection attention may be I eaiica tome importance of improving! our native stock. This can be most j quickly done by crossing1 ivith some \ of the improved breed-. Jersey bulls I can now be purchased at very reasonable prices. Kxcepting those from most noted strain*, bull calves can be bought from fifteen to fifty dollars, If a large, well-formed native cow. with good udder and large teats, be crossed i with a Jersey hull, the resulting grade j i will be valuable for meat, milk and j butter. It is remarkable how much ; both the quantity and quality of the i3 butter is improved by such a cross.! ] - For general purposes on a farm, such j\ a Jersey grade is. if anything, prefer- j] able to a full-blooded Jersey. It is ' hardier, has longer teats and is, there- \ fore, more easily milked, and when j old, makes more meat. In short, it is i a good combination animal. One near ; i a large market, who prefers selling \ inilk to baiter, might cross with a j I JLlolstein bull. The Hcistcin is a large : c breed and perhaps the deepen: milkers jt we have. They require good pastures ; ' and abundant food. ;; A cow is sometimes deli tied as a ! ] machine for converting food i::to :niik: i to get milk, therefore, there must be \ { food. A cow cannot make something! r out of uothing-^-ihat is an attribute of | j: omnipotence only. But the foods i j; given io animais ;,re quite variable i:: their.cotnposition, and one wight nat- ';uraily infer that a food with a certain a composition mi<rht be more cu.-ily and '' completely converted into milx iinin , ' some other of ditioreni character: an-! other might be more readily converted ;; into flesh aud fat. in a genera! way this has been recognized and accepted a fact.

Tables of composition and digestibility ci'the more common kinds of food and forage arc given in a little book' cailed "Farmer's Animal Handbook," j published by I). Appleton & Co., j of New York, * 'which every : farmer would lind useful and! convenient to have. (This is gratui-1 tons advertising, given without the knowledge ot "said publishers). In ; making up the ration for an animal, : the proper proportion of the three in- j gradients mentioned above can be secured only by mixing two or more foods in certain proportions. 2Co sin-; gle food contains them exactly in proper proportions, though some approximate it nearer than-others. If anyone of the three be present in a, ration in excess of the amount called ~ .1 V_- 1.^ for, it will not i>c appropriated uy mu animal, and will, therefore, be practi-; cally lost. A question of economy is, therefore, largely involved. Oar object now is to call attention to it to get our readers to think about the matter. At some future time we hope to give i several rations properly proportioned,; and mfde tip of the foods* and forages generally found 011 Southern farms. The work of the year is about finished. Would it not be weli to bal-; ance accounts and see whether we have ; made or lost? We hope all will find the balancc 011 the right side of the \ ledger, li any are so unfortunate as i to be in debt, we hope they will find ; themselves nearer out than they were 1 a year ago; and, inspired with fresh: hope, will enjoy the happy reunions of, the approaching1 unristmas. 10 onu and all the writer sends his warmest1 greetings.
