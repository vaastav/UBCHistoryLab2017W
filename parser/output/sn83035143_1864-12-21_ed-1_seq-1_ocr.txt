This morning a salute of one hundred guns was fired in honor of the great vic tory of Thomas over Hood. 1 be rebels snddeniy threw a few shells in reply, but they did no damage.

The resolution passed. Mr. Sumner, from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, reported the following aubsiitute for the House resolution pro viding for the termination of the Reci procity Treaty of June 5th, 1854, between the United Slates and Great Britain : Wherxas, It is provided in the Beci procitv Treaty, concluded at "Washington June 6ib, 1864, between the United States of one part, and the United Kingdom c f Great Britain and Ireland, ot tne otner part, that the treaty shall remain in force ten years trom tne date at wnicn u snau come into operation, and further until the expiration ol twelve months after either of the hign contracting parties snail give notice to tbe other of its wish to terminate the same, and W heezas, it appears by a procla mation ot the President of tbe United S'.s'e?, bearing date cf the 17th of March, 1855, that the treaty came into operation on that day, and W hebe ah. it lurtber appears tnat it is no longer for the interest of the United Slates to continue tbe lame in force, therefore Resolvei by the Senai and Homte of Representative of the United State o America, in Congret assembled, That notice be given of the termination of the tteciprocity Treaty, ao sordine to tne pro visions therein contained, for the termina tion of the same.

Mr. Wilkinson explained tbat it was not meryy for the purpose of retaliation that he sjlrsired the passage of this resolution. It had been staled by the rebels that the prisoners turned over to us in exchange would never be able to enter the service again, whilo their prisoners released from coLfinement in the North, would be fit for service immediately.

Mr. Grimes hoped the Senate would call for information, as requested by the Sena tor from Keiitucky. Ha had no doubt but the information would completely vin dicate the President and his Cabinet from tbe cbarges made by the Senator from Kentucky, and he did not propose to sit with his arms folded and hear, while the Representative ot Kentucky told of such deprivations of personal liberty. Johnson and Henderson, also, took part in this discussion, after which a vote was taken, and the Senate took up the resolu tion.

FROM NEW YORK. NEW YORK, Dec. 20. The Richmond Dispatch of the 17th, says, it is confidently reported that Sher man s forces were m front ot Hardee on the 16ih, and the surrender of Savannah being refused heavy fighting was going on that day. General Foster's operations on the Charleston and Savannah Railroad, are detailed by the Herald correspondent : . On the 8th tne whole army was ad vanced to within two hundred yards of the road, to cover the operations of a large working party trom the oath Massachu setts, who were sent to cut down a forest, so as to open a range for our artillery. The rebels used the railroad embankment for a breastwork and heavy skirmishing ensued, aoou a signal was given tnat tne 65th had Massachusetts aouoinpiisiied their work ard our forces were withdrawn. This the rebels took for a repluse, and rushed forward with a yell. Tbey paid dearly for their rashness, as at the proper time they were received with a witbering lire, and soon afterwards retreated. Uur line was then resumed, with skirmishers in sight of the railroad. Our artillery has command of the road through the wtnrow made in the woods by our men. Among the guns in position are some 30-pound pcrrotts. Tne neraias t on JncAaiiister corres pondent says of the capture of that fort, tbat at 4:3i A. M. on the 14th, General Hazen placed his division in position, with anotuer division of the 15th Corps as a support, and the order was given, when his gallant division marched at a double quiet tor ward, penetrated theabattis surrounding the work, plunged through the ditch, and scaled the parapets of the fort, ten feet in heighth, and swarmed into the work, under a hot fire, which, while it cut down many, failed to check the advance, and the work was ours. Most of the garrison bewildered by the sudden sweep of our veterans surrendered in haste, but otaers stood by their guns and fought until they were cut down. Not over three minutes had elapsed after our veterans leaped tbe parapetere tneir cheers announced the work done to the eager troops stretched aronnd the doomed city. Uur captures were zoo prisoners, 21 heavy guns and a large quantity of ordnance, subsistence and supplies, besides an open port, tnrougn wnicn uenerai Sherman can draw aii ot mi supplies. FROM ST.

A Washington special says: Prisoners lately arrived from the South are urging upon the President the imperative neces sity ot inaugurating retaliatory meas urc, for the protection ci our men in the rebel prisons. They assert that the rebels are not to reduced, that they need starve their prisoners, but have adopted the sys tematic plan to do so, ia order to kill them or force them into their array. They urge the President to notify the rebel Govern ment by proclamation or otherwise, that if fair and humane treatment is not accorded to prisoners within thirty days, all the rebels in eur hands will be reduced to such rations and accommodations as our men receive. They feel confident that such a course would bring the rebel authorities to terms within the specified time.

The Richmond Whig, in a long article on Sherman's march, Admits that he succeeded in reaching the coast without lots, and hints that the rebels might have made it worse for him. It says, that the fall of Fort McAllister does not secure the fall of Savannas, and even, if that city is captured it is of no account, and would amount to a3 much in tha conquest of the South as the capture of Chicago would to that of thf-; -i. SHERMAN AND HOOD. The Richmond Examiner makes a re view of Sherman's and Hood's campaign, and claims that the results are greatly for the advantage of the Cot federacy. It says: Even it Savannah falls, it will be nothing compared to the advantages of Hood's position in Central Tennessee. It thinkB that the destruction of the Virginia salt work3 by Baxbriuge isofmore injury to the rebels than would be the fall of Savannah. STOCK MARKET.

Yesterday's Evening Edition. Yesterday's Evening Edition. SHERMAN'S MARCH. NEW YORK, Dec. 20. The Herald correspondence from Fort McAllister and Hilton Bead, dated the 14th, says : When General Sherman ar rived in front of Savannah, after having marched 300 miles his troops, meanwhile, living on the very best r rovisior.s he had with him a drove of 1200 cattle, thou." a he started from Atlanta with only 203. He also gathered up on the tvay over 1 000 able-bodied negroes, and so many horses, muies and wagons as to embarrass him. His army, during a considerable portion of the march, extended over a sweep of country 60 miles in breadth, as much as four miles, at times, intervening between the right wH&g of one column and the left of the other, but communication was at all times kept up between the two. His whole loss in men from the time cf his leaving Atlanta until he arrived in front of Savannah, from wounds, sickness, cs p tares, straggling, and all other cases, was only about 1,00) the average daily march was about twelve miles. When the Ci'.y ol Savannah was invested by Sherman, it was unprepared for a siege, and it was be lieved that it could not hold out for mora than a few days. General Slocum holds all the approaches on tbe north side of the city, including all the railroads leading out of the town, and General Howard's army connects with his right, and swings around the Ogeechee River at Fort McAllister.

EXCITEMENT IN CANADA. MONTREAL, Dec. 20. It is reported that a number of the raiders wko went east have been arrested. A proclamation has been issued, offering a reward for their apprehension. There is much excitement in reference to the order calling out the militia. A large number have volunteered. There are reports ot an intended out rage by the Fenians, FROM THOMAS. NEW YORK, Dec. 20. The Times' special from Nashville, 19th, says: Thomas is pursuing the enemy to Duck River. We have nearly ail HooU's artillery. : The rivers are high, and the bridges in front of Hood are destroyed. We have captured 9,000 prisoners, inclu ding 8,000 wounded at Franklin, and four Major Generals. Hood had sixty-five guns, fifty-four oi which we now nave. The en emy's killed and wounded are about the same as ours. The number will not reach 3,500. Forrest gave Murfreesboro another trial on the 15th inst., and was repulsed by Rousseau and Milroy. The rebel General Johnson ssys their loss ; tbe - battle of .Franklin was 5,000, while ours was 1,900. Stoneman has whipped Breckinridge in East Tennessee, near the Virginia line, killing wounding, and capturing a large number, and taking most of his artillery. General Ed. McCook is alter Lyon iu Kentucky, and he cannot escape. . Murfreesboro, Bridgeport, Stevenson, Chattanooga and Knoxville, are all right. Oil Items. The Meadville Republican says: Ia the early days of the oil excitement a well was bored three hundred feet deep in tho vicinity of Sajgertown, but when the flow ing wells were discovered on Uil Creek the work was abandoned. Operations are about to be renewed, and our csegertown neighbors feel conflcent of success. In a few weeka we shall know whether tha up per part of French Creek Valley is profit able on territory. J The Oil City Register, in an article on the oil business, states that the shipments to foreign ports during the past year have reoched 29,000,000 gallons. A single well, tbe Noble and Delamater, has yielded over $1,600,000 the first cost of which was hard ly over $2,500. And we suppose that the total expense cf this well since the time it first commenced to flow, has not exceeded $19,000. Thus, for an investment of 12, 600, over $1,600,000 has been realized. Manv other weiis have been equally valu able to their owners, and the outlay has not been any greater, in regard to the pro portion of oil produced. . Two ' years ago the two acres upon Cherry Run. on which is the Reed & Chris well wall, could have been purchased fo' $1,500. It was lately sold for $650,000. The Smith farm, just above, consisting of fifty acres, was purchased about one year since, fpr $6,500. it now yields to its owners, the Cherry Valley Oil Company, three hundred barrel of oil daily, in roy alty, the company having been to little or no expense in its development. The Graff. Hasson farm, consisting of 1,000 acres, was purchasec in isat lor i.uuu. A few weeks since 325 acres of this farm sold for $750,000. General Rosecrans Removal. General Rosecrans has published a card in the Cincinnati Commercial refuting the slanders in circulation against him in refer- . ence to his removal from the command of j the Department of the Missouri. In refer ence to the oft-repeated charge that he was an habitual opium-eater, he says: I never rued opium, either to excess, or otherwise; in all my life. I never used any of its preparations morphine, laud anum, &a except as a medicine, and this, thank God, I have but rarely needed or taken. This vile slander could never hart) originated nor circulated among those wbo knew me. Woolen Garments for Discharged Soldiers. fliers. - 1 he Aid Societies of X or them Ohio are desired to consider the following letter as an especial appeal to their benevoicsce. It is from the Sanitary Commission at Mem- . phis, Tennessee: MEMPHIS, TENN., Nov. 28,1862. Societies of Xorthcm Ohio .- There is one want here, to meet which I think some direct steps should be taken at one?, and I am constrained to make special mention of i, not only because it is one of special urgeney, bat because it seems also ' that a call for more stores simply does not bring tbe articles to fill this want. Tbe ca'.l must needs bo a "spfeial call." Wool en undarslotmng, especially onderanirU and socks for individual cases of destitu tion, mainly among furloughed and dis charged men going North, are just now more needed than any other articles that could be named The excessive dampness o. the climate at this season of the year, as well as through the winter and earry spring, puts a fearful emphasis upon tha want for woolen underclothing daring this cool weather. I do not hesitate to say that this kind of clothing is more indispen sible to haalth here, than in the cooler cli mate of the North. I call for nnder shirts and not shirts, because we have an abund ant store of cotton shirts. Give ui nnder shirts, and wa can supply each man with both, and thus makehina com fortable, with less expense than if we attempt to supply full-lenf th woolen shirts. ' At present wt have neither undershirts, nor socks, ner drawers. For the two first the call is great often piteous. All. the fall ws have been turning away the needy nn supplied, still hoping for stores of this kind. During tha week just closed, we had at the Lodge a party of eighteen exchanged Federal pris oners of war, some of th unfortunate men of the Ill-fated Bed river expedition, and wbo were just from the rebel prison as Tyler, Texas. They were en route North. At the time they were here people wera wearing fnll winter dress, including over coats, mittens and furs. But these men were without underclothing, overcoats, and vests, of course, and I fear few of as who have never soldiered it, have thought how much warmth there is in a vest. The only shirt each had, showed age and condition such as no class of men I have ever seen, besides soldiers, ever yet accustomed to. Most of them had only the thin blouse and ragged pants. AH of them, sines they could not get new army clothing, were greatly in need of warm underclothing. I . robbed our store- rooms of almost the last undershirt and woolen shirt of any kind, and thus bore away six, but could not get a single pair of socks. Afterwards, how ever, five pairs were found at the rooms of the Christian Com nission. The matron of the Lodge transformed the cotton -fiannei hospital shirts into flannel undershirts, -and alter seising tha undershirts ef soma wno were not soldiers, we got togetner a fair outfit of underclothing for tiM men. And this is not an isolated ease of need. Besides the large number of eases met daily among furloughed and discharged men, this was; the third party of paroled and exchanged Federal prisoners of war that had thus appealed this fall to tha charitable reaoarces of the Commissions st this point. Nor was this ease soy more needy than thou daily met with in tha field of the Commission's labors. But I give it by way of enforcing my plea for woolen, under-clothing. Cannot a cheap article of an undershirt be furnished, ons t.at shall not cost mors than cotton shirts T Lven if one should represent the mousy value of two, yea three, cotton shirts, tha outlay would be wise, for that one. just now would do more good than ten cotton shirts. W ill not the Aid Societies as readily fur nish woollen ss cotton underclothing, to a limited extent, if once told that it is need ed f Cannot ws have, here at tha Lodge, 500 undershirts, 300 woollen drawers, and 500 pairs of soaks u LA. me. da oi ta -win- . ter, lor men sot in the hospitals nor with their commands, but who are furloughed and discharged, northward bound, and have been unable to supply themselves with suitableunderclothing T It should ba remembered that we have to issue woollen nnderclothing, inanv a time, when an overcoat, a warm undercoat or a new pair 01 pantaloons would mors tuny meat tha want. The work of fitting the Lodge for winter has not vet been begun. The city authorities still hold as in suspense. lam ratified in beina- able to ut thax in my Department everything goes on smoothly. v ery respectfully yours, E. W.
