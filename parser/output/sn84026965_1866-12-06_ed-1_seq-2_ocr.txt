two hundred years, and was intimately interwoven with the whole social, indus? trial and financial fabric of the State. "We obeyed. When the Legislature as? sembled, we were required to ratify tho Constitutional Amendment abolishing Slavery in the United States, and were made,, in part, instruments to accomplish ^tfeatresult in Kentucky and Delaware, ?when those States had refused to do so of their own volition. We obeyed. In ad? dition to this, all the citizens of South Carolina, with scarcely ai? exceptionfc took :the amnesty oath, which required them to sustain and support all the proclama . tiohs and laws made during the war, and _ particularly those relating to the abolition ; of slavery. These oaths have been ob . served by tho groat mass of the people with singular fidelity, and every essential attribute of a true and thorough loyalty to the Constitution and Union has been exhibited and praoticed. In addition to all this, the General Assembly of the State has, by solemn enactment, accorded to the black race all the rights of person and property enjoyed by the white race. . They can buy and sell, grant, convey and devise. If their person or personal rights are invaded, the same judicial tribunals " vindicate them. They go upon the wit? ness stand and testify j they are permit? ted to testify in their own cases, even when on trial for the gravest offences. " How many of the States now enjoying a representation in that Congress which proposes this amendment to us for ratifi? cation accord by their own laws the same general rights and privileges to the black man? They have out a meagre number Of negroes in their midst, ami if allowed to tote, their ignorance and depravity would produce no appreciable effect upon the result, being less than one-and-one oigth per cent, of the voting population, whereas their relative number here is as fortyrone blacks to thirty whites. Do sensible, fair and just men at the North desire that these people, without infor? mation or education?steeped in igno? rance, crime and vice, should go to the polls and elect men to Congress who aro, to pass laws taxing and governing them? New, that all this has been done, what further or higher pledge of honorable obedience can be given by one people to another? Does the majority who now rule Congress expect to mako us better men or better citizens?more serviceable to the country in peace and in war, by further humiliating and degrading us ? Notwithstanding all those pledges and concessions, it is sought still further to humiliate and degrade the South. Eleven of the Southern States, including South i Carolina, are deprived of their represen? tation in Congress. Although their Sen? ators and Representatives have been duly elected, and have presented themselves; for the purpose of talcing their credentials have, in most instances, been laid upon the table without being read, or have been referred to a committee, who have failed to .make any report on the subject. In short, Congress has refused to exer? cise its Constitutional functions, and de? cide either upon the election, tho return, or the qualification of those selected by the States and poople to represent us. Some of the Senators and Represents- j tives from the Southern States were pre-1 pared to take the test oath, but even j these have boen persistently ignored, and iept out of the seats to which they were j entitled under the Constitution and laws. Hence this amendment has not boen pro posed by "two-thirds of both Houses" of j a legally constituted Congress, and is not,1 Constitutionally or legitimately, before a ; single Legislature for ratification. Wav-1 ing this point, however, is it compatible J with the interest, or consistent with the honor, of this State, to ratify that amend? ment? Do not its first and last sections, if adopted, confer upon Congress the ab? solute right of determining who shall be citizens of the respective States, and who shall exercise the elective franchise and ^nj?y any and all of the rights, privi? leges and immunities of citizenship ? ?The sections referred to not only do - this, but they subvert the theory and practice of the Government since its "foundation, by abrogating the right of fixing the elective franchise conferred upon the respective State Governments, and by giving the representatives of Or? egon or California in Congress the power -to declare what shall constitute the meas? ure of citizenship within the limits of South Carolina or Georgia. Who is most likely to exercise this power judiciously, the citizens of tho State wherein the regulation is to be made, or non-residents, who are entirely ignorant of the popula? tion, the intelligence, neeessities and resources for which legislation is under? taken? With this amendmont incorpo? rated in the Constitution, does not the federal Government cease to bo one of "limited powers" in all of the essential -Qualities which constitute such a form of Government ? Nay, more; does net its adoption reverse the well approved doc? trine;, that the United SHtes shall exer? cise no powers, unless expressly delegated fey the Constitution ? . The third section, if its spirit were car? ried out, would not only disorganize the State Government in all its departments, but would render it nearly imnossible for the people.of South Carolina, at least, to ?re-organize a government until Congress, by a two-thirds vote in the case of each individual person, removes the disability. And this, or the reason that when seces? sion was determined upon by the Conven? tion of the State, South Carolina may be truly said to have been a unit in sustain? ing "the doctrine, and in earnestly and zealously prosecuting the war. When, therefore, every citizen who, at any time prior to seoession had taken the oath "to snpport the TJonBtitution of this State, ana of the United States," and who sub aeqtiently aided and abetted the war, is ?xcluded from every official position, State as* well as Federal, tho magnitude of tho disability is unveiled. Every officer in the past of the State, civil and military, was required, before entering upon the discharge of the duties of his office,-.^ subscribe to such oath, from the Senator in Congress to the lieutenant in the boat companies. Wao then can be made Judges, Congresmen, Legislators, Dis? trict Officers and Magistrates? It is to bo observed, therefore, that as to this State, the adoption oi the amendment will necessarily result in perjury on the part Of those who attempt to fill such offices, .or to anarchy, if they are not filled. Con? gress, violating another established prin ciple of the Constitution, confers upon itself the right of the pardoning power, when the Constitution Tests it in the President. Hew long would it occupy the attention of that body to remove the disabilities imposed, for a sufficient num? ber of our eitizens to fill the respective offices in South Carolina alone ? Is an? archy to pervade society until it suits tho interests, the prejudicies, the passion or the caprico of Congress to proclaim such acts of grace and mercy ? There are other objections of a grave character which might be urged; and among these it may bo mentioned, that if the amendment is adopted, wc not only have no guarantee that our representa? tives would bo admitted to Congress, but there are unmistakable indications that thoy would still be excluded! It is un? necessary, however, to dwell upon a sub? ject which has been so far decided by tho public opinion of the peoplo of the State, that I am justified in saying, that if the Constitutional amendment is to be adopt? ed, let it be done by the irresponsible powor of numbers, and let us preserve our own self-respect, and the respect of our posterity, by refusing to be the mean in? struments of our shame. I tender to you, gentlemen, my cordial co-operation in discharging the grave duties and responsibilities devolved upon you at this critieal and eventful period in our history. You have the glorious rem iniscenses of the past to stimulate, and the precious hopes of the future to en? courage you, in meeting these responsi? bilities with fortitude, courage and dis? cretion, and relying upon the support and protection of the all-powerful arm of a gracious God, your patriotic efforts to re? store the blighted prosperity and reclaim the broken fortunes of a generous, noble and confiding constituency will be crown? ed with grateful success. 

JAMES L. ORR. &IMiE83Ms So (P. Thursday Morning, December 6th, 1866. ANDERSON HIGH SCHOOL. Aa examination of this School will bo held in the Court House on to-morrow (Friday) morning, commencing at 9 o'clock. Declamations at seven o'clock p. m. The publio is respectfully invited to attend. Several original speeches from tho students may be expected. ?;. 1 ??*? SENTENCE COMMUTED. The sentence of Moses Lacket, oonvioted of horse-stealing at the October term of the Court of General Sessions and condemned to be hung on Friday, 14th inst., has beenoommutedby the Gov? ernor to ten years' imprisonment in the Peniten? tiary. GEN. ELLISON CAPEES. We are gratified to learn that this gallant and accomplished soldier has received a fitting tribute at the hands of the Legislature. On Saturday last Gen. Capebs was elected Secretary of State by a vote of 97 to 86 over his opponent, W. B. Humtt, Esq., the incumbent. We oongratulato tho General upon this evidence of his popularity. -o THE GOVERNORS MESSAGE. To the exclusion of our usual variety, the Mes? sage of Gov. Onn is presented in this issue. So many of our readers will bo unable to obtain this document elsewhere, that we cheerfully give place to the most important portions. It is clear, manly and straightforward, and deserves an attontivo perusal. PERSONAL. We are pleased to announce a visit from Col. R. A. Thompson, of tho Pickens Courier, who has been sojourning in our town for two or three days past. Our old friend "Bob" has been running the gauntlet down in Columbia, havingjjust been re elected Commissioner in Equity for Pickens Dis? trict, without opposition. May he ever thrive in all his efforts! -? THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. This document appears at length in the Colum? bia Phoenix of Tuesday, but we are compelled to defer any extracts therefrom. President Johnson firmly adheres to the positions always assumed by Mm in regard to reconstruction. Wo are enabled from the source above indicated, to present the proceedings of Congress during the first day of the session. 

ADMITTED TO PRACTICE. On Wednesday last there were admitted to prac? tice, in tho Courts of this State, over fifty appli? cants in law and thirty in equity. If the people can bear this inundation of newly-fledged attor? neys, we are certain they will prove equal to every emorgency. John 6. Moore, Esq., of this town, was admit? ted to Equity, and our whilom townsmen, Wm. Vau Wick, Jr., and Augustus Va* Wtck, admit? ted to the practice of Law, and the last named to Equity also. Wo oongratulato these gentleman upon their successful entrance into their respective spheres, ? ? ? REPORTED DEAD. The negro Dan, the chief actor in the murder of young Gxsa in January last, is reported to have died at tho plantation of Dr. 0. R. Bbotles, near Jonesboro, Tenn., on the 4th ultimo. Two young men from this community had been sent to East Teaneaaeo for the purpose of arresting Dan, and upon their arrival, they ascertained that his oareer was ended most miserably aa above stated. These gentlemen returned a few days ago, bringing cer j tificates from citizens of the neighborhood, sub? stantiating tho fact of his death and identifying j him beyond doubt Though human justice did not [ reach this vile murderer, tho throes of death indi j cated a more terrible retribution beyond the grave. Truly, "tho way of the transgressor is hard." -? - ?-? THE LEGISLATURE. The proceedings of this body have been generally i unimportant. The introduction of bills, presenta? tion of petitions, and elections for minor offices, j form the chief portion of business transacted as yet. We presume that the various Committees aro [ diligently preparing business for both Houses. I The election for Solicitor of the Western Circuit took place on Tnesday, but we have not heard the i result. Hon. J. P. Reed, Gen. W. K. Easlxt, and ' Jons H. Etrms, Esq., are the candidates. The election for United States Senator will pro | bably come off this week also. The term of Ex Got. Masxin? expires on the 4th of March next, and this election is to supply the vacancy thus created. Hon. J. B. Campbell, of Charleston, is spoken of in this connection. An effort is being made to postpone the election, but we presume that the Logialaturo will hardly acquiesoe in the propooitlon. EDITORIAL NOTES OV TRAVEL. After a pleasant and agreeable relief from the labors of the sanctum, the editor has returned to his post and mamed his position in the treadmill, prepared Ttith increased rigor and determination to yield a constant devotion to his chosen pursuit. During his absence, these columns have boen pre? sided over by the accomplished contributing edi? tor, Warrbi* D. Wiljcss, Esq., and to the latter are earnest thanks due for the faithful discharge of all duties appertaining to the position. So much by nay of preface, and we proceed to indite a few observations made during our visit to charleston. Leaving Anderson On Monday, the 19th ultimo, tho cars boro us away with considerable velocity from the scenes of ovcry-day toil, the unceasing round of labor, and the comforts and endearments of home. In schedule time, the train arrived at Columbia, and although detained at the depot to obtain a trunk from amongst the pile of "uncheck? ed" baggage, we got to Nickersox's in ample time to receive a hearty welcome from the obliging as? sistant, Mr. Hamilton. Parenthetically, we will -remark that there was nothing extraordinary in the aforesaid trunk,?little indeed beyond a change of linen, tooth brush, oomb, several unpaid ac? counts, &c,?yet we were anxious to keep it in closo proximity, for there is no knowing what an editor may "pick np" when he is cut looBe from tho moorings. Ilence we were obliged to wait until the baggage was assorted, and the expected receptacle of our pickings appeared, owing to the annoying fact that the Greenville and Columbia Railroad lost all their "checks" in a little game played by a Mr. Sherman down there some two years ago. However, this difficulty is soon to be remedied, and new ohecks provided, as we were afterwards informed by the energetic President and worthy Superintendent. But to return from this complaining digression?the trunk and our self wero safely registered at the Hotel of Colum? bia, and having enjoyed an excellent supper, we took a stroll amid the ruins of our onoe beautiful capital. Business occupied most of the evening, and we will defer observation upon tho desolate scene presented until another part of our "notes" Is reached. Leaving by the morning tram', we were soon whirling away to the point of destination, and en? joying the luxury of arespeotable ride on the South Carolina Road. The conductor was polite, the car neat and comfortable, and the company most agreeable. At four o'clook p. m. the train reached Charleston, and our party wag speedily conveyed to the charleston hotel. This magnificent and well appointed establish? ment extended the greeting of other and more prosperous times. The reputation achieved in former years is still maintained, and since the war closed the entire building has undergono thorough repair, the rooms newly furnished, and the corps of polite attendants fully re-organized. In every respect, the "Charleston" ia a model in its line, and deserves all the' praise and admiration be? stowed by its numerous patrons. The gentle? manly proprietors and their assistants devote un? remitting attention to guests, and the man who does not feel perfectly at home under their hospi? table care is fit alone for "treason, stratagem and spoils." We are under especial obligations to our clever friend, George Mixer, whose genial coun? tenance and rotund form bear tho impress of a no? ble nature. And we must not forget to mention the kindness of Chablih Miller, the obliging book-keeper, who took such pains in showing us about the public and private parlors, whioh aro adorned with all that good taste or ingenuity can invent. In a word, our sojourn with the good fel? lows in this establishment has convinced us that there are some folks who understand keeping a ?hotel. But we must hasten on. the grand lodge of ancient fbbhasoxs, In and for the jurisdiction of South Carolina, con? vened at Masonio Hall, in the city of Charleston, at high twelve on Tuesday, 20th ult., and therefore was in session upon our arrival. Being favored with the credentials of a delegato to that body, we were soon in the midst of our brethren of the mys? tic tie. The Grand Master, Hon. J. L. Orr, de? livered his address beforo we reached the city, but it is propor to remark in this connection that tho address expressed the prosperous condition of the Order throughout the State, besides conveying the intelligence that the liberal donation of $1,000 from the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania had been mado to assist in rebuilding tho temples destroyed by fire and sword, nhjch donation was afterwards suitably acknowledged. The proceedings havo al? ready been published, at least such as are intended for general information, and we will not trespass upon the patience of our readers by another re? capitulation. Suffice it, that the session was large? ly attended, and marked with unanimity and brotherly love. The Grand Lodge was closed on Wednesday night, at twelve o'clock, and we were theft aft er free to enjoy tho Bights and renew an acquaintance with the city. memories amid TBS roths. In April, 1860, it was our privilege to be In at? tendance upon the famous Charleston Convention, where "history was enaoted," and where Yanoet and Douglas, both now silent in death, repre? sented the opposing wings of the great Democratic party. The impetuous Southerner lead the van j against the friends of the Western orator?for, be it remembered, Douglas was not in proprio per tojut there, but only his views controlling the an? tagonistic element?and day after day witnessed the struggle, until finally came the culmination of the powerful combat, when members from various States seceded from the Convention. We might dwell upon this soene, and sketch the several char? acters of the Imposing drama. There stood the cool, intrepid Vallandinoham, the smoothly pol? ished Fernando Wood, the plaoid Caleb Cushino presiding with consummate ability, and others of lesa notoriety, from amongst the Northern poli? ticians. Here, making their egress from the spa? cious Hall, now tumultuous with the uproar of contention, were the Southern delegations, headed by their ohosen and eloquent leader, the gifted Yajcobt. Anon, with impurtable gravity, stood another whose devotion to principle made him quail not before the popular voice, and whose "Union proolivities" then were uttered with man? liness and courage Though no admirer of Gov. Pbbbt as a politician in those days, we entertain? ed the highest respect for his boldness and te mority. Such was the scene presented at the In? stitute Hall just one year before the bombardment of Fort Sumter. What mighty changes I Civil war ensued this aotion of the Democratio party, and after four years of gigantic strife, peace has spread her snowy drapery, after a fashion, over this land. But where find we, amid the ruins, tho Institute rendered so famous by the scene thus described ? Alas! its walls have crumbled, its columns broken, and not a vestige remains of the magnificent structure. The destructive fire of 1861, which swept away hundreds of houseB, em? braced within its desolating track this historical building. Such were our reflections while stand, ing on the site of the Institute Hall, ftnd po&derisg over the memories of the past. The great fire referred to has left Charleston a lasting nonam^stv yy> fair, y ty. dgsolAtipj} and -i i extent. From tbe Copper to the Ashley, the wide breach then mado is scarcely touched by the hand of improvement. Many years of prosperity will bo required before the ravages of that awful De? cember night will be effaced. the batteby by mooslioht. Yielding to the kind solicitation of a friend, wo joined a small party of ladies and gentlemen, and sought an inspection of the Battery and Harbor by moonlight. Ante bellum, this stroll would have been among gay crowds of damsels and gallants, but on this occasion the almost loneliness of the sceno induocd Bombre reflections. Beyond the party spoken of, scarcely an individual ventured to be seemingly romantic by a visit to this once general resort of the elite and the humbfe *'The Battery" always occupiod a prominent niche in the affections of Charlestonians, but with the neg? lect and :'ocay of the past five years apparently has gone glimmering those anticipations and delights. However, wo strolled around the fine terrace walk, despite the ominous silence and in defiance of the stiff November breeze. The signal lights were glistening hero and thero, and by the bright efful genoe of Luna we were onabled to descry upon the water's level some of the points noted during the protracted siege of Charleston. Castle Pinckney seems almost within a stone's throw on the left, while just beyond in the samo direction lies Sulli? van's Island, where Fort Moultrie stands in con? fident strength. To the right, and farther in the distance, tho dismantled walls of Sumter quietly breathe a tale of heroic suffering and endurance such as is not equalled by the pages of history, in the old or new world. We remember the obivalric Elliott and the brave Calbode, with their com? rades and successors, in this connection. Time cannot destroy tbe record these men made while in defence of the grim fortress. Just out beyond Sumter is the point of Moms' Island, known aa Cumming's Point, where the iron-clad battery brought to bear the missiles which compelled the fort's surrender in 1861. This Island was the theatre of operations for so many months during the siege, that only.a simple reference is needed to refresh the memories of those who participated in its glories and defeats. Nearer to the city, and in plainer view, is James' Island, stretohing its beach for miles within reach of the naked eye. Planters have gone back to its enchanting pleasures, and they reck not that this Island is included within historic ground. The palo moon withdraws from the scene, and shelters behind friendly clouds. Our walk upon the Battery is ended, and we leave its precincts with a sigh for tho men who gave up life on thoso consecrated embattlements of Sumter and tho en sanguinod desert of Morris' Island. the stbeet bailwat. The most gratifying advancement in the way of new improvements is tho construction of a street railway, which begins at the intersection of Broad Street on East Bay, and from thence up Meeting, through Wentworth to King, and then continuing the course of the latter street to the upper portion of the city. The double track is about completed, and we are confident that the good people of Charleston will derive comfort and convenience from this enterprise, which is sustained by North? ern capital. tbe b?8iness of chable8t0x. The fall trado of tho merchants has been truly encouraging, and they aro determined to retain the patronage now flowing in upon them. Tho inter? ests of our commercial metropolis are so closely interwoven with the prosperity of the entire State, that wo hail with satisfaction the evidences of suc? cess and advancement. With facilities equalling any period within its history, Charleston is pre? pared to furnish the dealers and consumers of this and adjoining States with any article at as low figures as Northern cities. The business of im? porting has largely increased during the past few months, and indeed is stamped as a permanent and profitable feature in the trade of that city. With proper encouragement from our own people, we are prepared to say that Charleston is destined to be? come ono of the chief commercial marts of this country. Though desolated and blackened by the ravages of war, thero is manifested a spirit of en? terprise and determination among her citizens which will eventually succeed. sunday in the cht. Among tho pcoplo intent on divine worship, thero appeared to us a remarkable coincidence.? Residents may fail to observo this fact, but we were impressed with the idea that all the up-town folks attended the down-town churches, and vice versa. Being for tho nonco connected with the lower section of the city, wo embraced the oppor? tunity of hearing the Rev. Mr. Cuthbebt, of the Citadel Square Baptist Church, in tho forenoon.? The earnest, impressive style of this reverend gen? tleman enchained our attention immediately, and for three-quartors of an hour we listened with un? abated interest to his practical and argumentative discourse. At night we had the pleasure of listen? ing to a leoture from Bev. Dr. Winklee before the Young Men's Christian Association, being the oponing lecture of the season. This admirable so? ciety is presided over by Leonard Chapin, Esq., and has just resumed its operations after the sus? pension caused by the recent struggle. In addi? tion to their charitable designs, and efforts for the moral and religious training of young men, a regu? lar weekly lecture is delivered in one of the church? es by some designated clergyman. The occasion above alluded to was fraught with more than ordi? nary interest, and the Second Presbyterian Church was amply filled with the young of both sexes.? Dr. Wmkxeb's effort at that time was, in every re? spect, worthy of his exalted reputation as an ora? tor and minister. jg^ Having extended those "notes" beyond the space intended to be ocoupied in this way, we must come to an abrupt conclusion, but may re? sume in our next issue. -o HOT 

SUPPER. The ladios of the Presbyterian congregation in? tend regaling the appetites and pleasing the fancies of our people by an unique and inviting entertain? ment just prior to the holidays. On Friday night, 21st inst., they propose to give another Hot Sup? per for the benefit of their Church, and we bespeak from tho public a generous share of patronage.? FreBh Norfolk oysters, rich and deucious coffee, meats of every description, elegant cakes, oonfec tionaries, &c, will be embraced in the attractive bill of fare. Besides all these delicacies and sub stantials, there will be on exhibition a handsome tree, filled with presents for folks of all ages. Of course, you buy the present and thus obtain an in? terest in the tree. We know that the ladies in charge of this affair will display their proverbial energy and good taste, and would earnestly commend their praisoworthy purpose to the citizens generally. -o J?* Attention is directed to the new advertise? ments in this issue. We shall take occasion next week to direct special notice to each one of our Charleston and Columbia patrons, -?> ?Jfca?" Mr. B. F. Cbattch will please accept our thankB for a pamphlet copy of Got.

At an early hour, crowds of people were on. the way to the Capitol, and by noon the galleries of both houses wero densely crowded. There wan a quorum pres? ent, and punctually at 12 m. the presiding officers of both houses appeared and called the respective branches to order. The Senate was opened with prayer by its Chap? lain, Dr. Grey. Thirty-seven Senators were pres? ent, and the first business was the presentation of the credentials of Senators Pollard, of Vermont, Cattell and Freelinghuysen, of New Jersey, Ed? munds, of Vermont, and Fogg, of New Hampshire, elected to fill unezpired terms. The credentials of Messrs. Burnett and Roberts, from Texas, were laid on the table. Mr. Sumner moved to take up the bill to establish negro suffrage in the District of Columbia, saying the people demanded its pas? sage, and would hail it with joy. After a slight discussion, the Chair decided that tho motion to take the bill up was not now in order. Among the bills introduced was one by Mr. Chandler, request? ing the President tc communicate to the Senate whether the Emperor of the French had complied with the stipulations entered into with our Govern? ment, relativo to the withdrawal of troops from Mexico. The Message of the President was com? municated about two o'clock, and read by the Sec? retary. After the adoption of the usual motion to print, adjourned. In the Houso, a resolution was introduced by Elliott, of Massachusetts, providing for the ap? pointment of a Standing Committee, to be designa? ted " Committee on Freedmen." Mr. Boutwell introduced a bill, calling upon the Secretary of State for all tho correspondence rela? tive to the arrest of John H. Surratt. Mr. Schenck offered a bill to provide that the regular time of meeting of the 40th Congress, and of every subsequent Congress, shall be at noon on 4th of March, and the ensuing session on the 1st January. The bill was made the special order for Thursday. Mr. Stevens presented a bill to regulate removals from office. It provides that upon all cases of ap? pointment, where the consent of the Senate is nec? essary, the President shall not make removals while the Senate is not in session, unless concurred in by that body under the provisions of this bill, within ten days after the Senate assembles. The bill was made the special order for Friday next. Mr. Boutwell introduced a bill to authorize the Secretary of tho Treasury to sell out at public auction, in New York, two millions in gold, on Monday of each week, in lots not exceeding ten thousand dollars. The following measures were also Introduced, and referred to appropriate committees: One to provide by general law* for modes of proccedure in trials for impeachment before tho Senate, and another calling upon the President for information relative to the application of Confederate General Pickctt for pardon. The day was consumed en? tirely with the introduction of resolutions and bills, until the arrival of the message, before which Mr. Stevens made an incffeclut.l motion to adjourn. The Postmaster-General's r;port shows that the liabilities for mail service in .he late Confederate States for the year ending June 30, last, were on? ly $75,383 in excess of the n<;t revenues for pos? tage in that section. The report of the Secretary of tho Treasury is regarded as likely to have au extremely favorablo effect on the public credit; th j opinion expressed by the Secretary that specie payments should be resumed July 1, 1868, is variously disoussed, and the prevailing opinion is that within that time our 7-30's and compound notes cannot be paid. It is rumored that McCullough is selling gold secretly, to depress the premium, but there is no authority for this. A reception was given to the Republican mem? bers of Congress in the afternoon, on the Eastern portico of the capitol. The procession which pro? ceeded thither was composed of more than one half of negroes. Speeches were made by Justice Carter, Speaker Colfax, Senator Yates, and Repre? sentative Kelley. Their remurks were ultra radi? cal, and were received with great favor by the j mixed assemblage. Mr. Elliott asked leave, during tho session to? day, to introduco a bill to repeal the 13 th section of the Act of July 17, 1862; which section au? thorizes the President to extend by proclamation to persons who may have participated in the re? bellion, pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions, at such times and on such conditions as he might deem expedient for the public good. Mr. Finch objected to its introduction, the rules requiring one day's notice. Upon motion of Mr. Elliott, the rules were suspended, and ihe bill passed by a vote of 111 to 29. ^????
