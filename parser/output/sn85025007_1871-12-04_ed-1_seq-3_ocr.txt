Year by yea; those who wish to keep them elves informed in the literature of the day come more generally to recognize The Living Age as the best means for attaining that end within the reach of per sons of moderate leisure." This is owing tc the fact that The Living Age. being published in weekly numbers of sixty-four pages each, gives more than three thousand double column oc'tyo pages of rcadiug matter yearly, and is thereby enabled to present with a satisfactory completeness, nowhere else attempted, whatever ia of immediate interest or permanent value iu the vast and generally inaccessible mass of foreign periodical literature.?a litera ture embracing the productions of the able*' living writers in every department, whether relating to history, biography, fiction, poetry, wit. .science, politics, tneology, criticism or art. As a fresh compilation of the admirable and noteworthy in current literature, including the ablest and most interesting essays, reviews, serial and short stories, poetry, scientific, histoiical, and politioal information, it has become invaluable, iu the great and growing multiplicity of quarterlies, monthlies, and weeklies, to every person or family of intelligence and taste. The highest critical authoritiesot the country unite in pronouncing it "the best of all our eclectic publications." The uibscriptiou price ($8 a year) is cheap iu proportion to the amount of reading matter niroished ; but for those who desire the cream of both home and foreign literature a st'll cheaper offer is made by the publishers (Littcll & Gay, Boston), viz:, for $10, they will send The Living Age, weekly, and cither one of the leading American $4 monthlies, for a year; or for $S.oO The Living Age and Our Young Folks. "Possessed of The Living Atre and of one or. other of our vivacious American monthlies, a subscriber will find himself in command of the whole situation.

Alcorn, ui Mis sissippi, were presented and thai senator advanced and took the oath of otrice The usual committer* to inform the President and the other Moure that Congress had assembled, was appointed. A resolution was introduced for the immediate re construction of the destroyed public buildings at Chicago. Mr. Sumuer presented Uu? petititions from Dr. Augusta and Dr. Powers, complaining that they were not admitted lu the Medical Society of the District of Columbia 01: account of their color, and urged that Congress should, at ihe earliest period, take r.lejjs to jn..t,-ei mo colored race. A petition of Mr. Plcasanton, Into Com mis ioner of Internal Revenue, prole.-ting against the manner oi' his removal IVoni the olliou of Commissioner of Internal Revenue was pre. senled. It was suggested that this busiue?s was ' proper for executive session and the paper was withdrawn. Mr. Sumner introduced a hill for substitute ' ing legal tender notes for compound interest notes. The effect of this bill would, he said, in a few months make paper equivalent to coin and bring about specie payment. The susnoni sion of specie payments and of the writ of habeas i corpus were, he said, war measures, and tocon tinuo :heni beyond the war was an outrage. The President's message was then received i and read. In the House of Representatives the u.Mtal committee to inform the President of the assembling of Congress was appointed. The standing commit tecs ol the House were announced. A resolution of inquiry into the suspension of habeas corpus in South Carolina was introduced. Mr. Dawes, oi" Mass.. objected, and on motion of Gen. Butler it was referred to the committee on insurrectionary States. The President's message was then received and read. Mr. Sumner's early attack upon the President's suspension ol the habeas corpus is looked upou as the first gun from the uuti-Administration republicans.

At the court martial the Chaplain Siated that it was only a student's frolic and did not deserve severe sentences, but the clamor.-, of the volunteers overruled everything else, and eight were condemned to death, eleven sentenced ru six years in the chain gantr, nim teen to lour years iu the same gang, four ?o six moths imprisonment and t-o ",'i v libmatod.
