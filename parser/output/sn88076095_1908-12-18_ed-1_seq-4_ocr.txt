Whatever may be the feelings of the members of Congress con cerning the strictures passed up on their action in curtailing the use of Secret Service men, the fact remains that the people's representatives are met for the business of the nation. The time of session is short, and it is nec essary for the representatives of the people to give their attention to legislation, rather than to dis cussions of the respective rights and functions of their branch of the government and the execu tive. Much valuable time may be wasted in deepening an unfortu uate breach. The first duty of the members of Congress is to the country, and not to them selves. The time-honored divis ions of the government will re main as the Constitution pre scribed long after Mr. Roosevelt liaa relinquished the reins, and the activities of Congress will not s u ff er serious detriment through his opinions or measures. The necessity of the present is not work for vindication of dig nity, but work to assure the peo ple that their representatives are superior to the aspersion, too often made, that Congress spends too much time in talk. This has become the bane of the age. Talk, talk, talk. Congress should turn itself to work—and keep at it The market reports a break in eggs. But, then, it ought not, in the natural course of things, be hard to. break an egg corner. A Gift for the Family Get a Packard for your .home and you give to all again and again.

EATON Bowbells, N. D. The attendance -at the tuber culosis exhibit in New, York shows the great general interest in the movement. So much of co-operation is needed on the part of the general public that this evidence of intelligent inter est in the big fight against one of the greatest scourges of hu manity is highly encouraging. When the mass of the people are eager to learn what to do in daily life to help stamp out the White Plague they will put in practice the preventive means, the know ledge of which these public ex hibits will do much to spread. One of the political prophets says that war is inevitable be tween Germany and England. No friend of humanity wants a war between these two powers to come, and it is consolation to the peaceful-minded that the language is not always equal to emergencies, so that "impossible" things sometimes do happen and "inevitable" catastrophies are sometimes averted. The "boss" mayor of San Fran cisco has been found guilty of bribery, and the ring of grafters who dominated that city is being broken up, with the chief graft ers either in prison or facing terms. Among the other mills which have resumed active op eration are evidently the mills of the gods, which, according to a i i o n w i e e y i n slowly, grind exceedingly small.'' Carrie Nation is now in Dublin, pursuing her work of reform. She is in the right place for a fight, and while the sons of the Emerald Isle are too gallant to be rough with a lady, she will probably find her visit quite as lively as she could desire. According to a press dispatch a woman of sixty-five in a trial in St. Louis swore on the witness stand that she had never told a lie in her life. At last the im mortal George Washington as a miracle of veracity is outclassed. A French admiral has been re lieved of his command for talking too much. The general revolu tionary tendencies of the times seem to be working havoc with the talking habit in high places. Mr. Bryan may be nominated a university president. With William Jennings Bryan e i nomination habit seems hard to overcome. The Powder Truar^Vidently had the other trusts beaten to a frazzle, for, according to facts just developed, it had cornered the earth, and was only stopped in its operations by the uncer tainty yet existing as to whether the rest of the solar system is inhabited. The "hazardous" oil business, as Mr. Rockefeller is pteased to term it, in six years made a profit of $24,000,000 on a capital of $1,000,000. Even a man conserv ative to the point of timidity might be induced to take risk like that. Congress fiercely resents the idea advanced in the President's message that it might need watching. And yet there have been times when the country dimly suspected it, even though everybody was too polite to say so. John D. Rockefeller is reported as having given a New Bruns wick waiter a five-cept tip the other day. It was long ago pre dicted that John would sooner or later develop spendthrift pro clivities. The funerals of the late Em peror and Dowager Empress of China will cost that nation over $4,000,000. But, still, there are many who think that even at that figure the occasion is worth the price. A fifty million dollar spinster has just died in New York in her nineties. There must be some heartaches over this news in noble European families who missed such a prize. Boni says Helie is a scoundrel, and Helie says Boni is a dishonest fool. From which it would ap pear to the ordinary human that each seems to bear the other great Anna-mosity. And now charges are matie in Chicago of a funeral trust. This is running the thing Into the ground and an exchange remarks that the charge forms a grave is sue. Pat Crowe is now an evangel-, ist, but it's a cinch, however, that he'll never convert any of the Cudahy family. Church Notes.
