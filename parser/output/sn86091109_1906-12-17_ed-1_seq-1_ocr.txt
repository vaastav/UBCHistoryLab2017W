NO r TO BLAME President Elliot Claims Fuel Supply Is In* adequate WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.—In re sponse to an inquiry addressed to the presidents of several western rail roads by the inter-state commerce commission as to the cause of the re ported shortage of cars for the trans portation of fuel by reason of which great suffering is entailed, President Elliott of the Northern Pacific railroad telegraphs to the commission from St. Paul in effect that the company has done all,and will continue to do all It can do to prevent suffering. He says his company warned fuel deal ers In June and July that the fuel supply was likely to be Inadequate, advising them to provide stock and to seek new sources of supply. President Elliott says the charges sf extraordinary delays in transporta tion do not apply to his company. He says the difficulty In Washington, Ida ho and Montana is that not enough coal is being produced to supply promptly the Increased domestic trade and at the same time furnish the rail roads with .sufficient fuel to operate their trains. The floods in the Cas cades in November damaged the North cn Pacific tracks and a number of important mines could not be reached for weeks. Heavily Increased traf fic In all commodities has also tended to increase the difficulties of the situ ation. " ... ,i FEW 

FROM Portland, Dec. 16—While today passed without serious incident, it Is feared that tomorrow will see de monstrations more riotous than those of Saturday night when a mob of sympathizers of the striking street car operatives In- this city forced the Portland Light and Power company to abandon Its service for the night. This is the fear of the police depart ment and of General Manager Ful ler of the street car company. It Is freely admitted by the street car men that they will leave no stone unturn ed to prevent the operation of cars tomorrow. Bright and early this morning the strikers were on hand at the car barns doing missionary work among those who remained faithful to the com pany and this missionary work was followed up during the day by the strikers wherever and whenever a car operatives could be found willing to listen to their arguments. In many cases the operatives remained firm In their allegiance to the company, but In many others they did not. A meeting was held by the strikers today after the com« any had sent Its cars to the barn, but nothing that transpired was given out. It ,is known, however, that the street' car men have been assumed the support of the Federated Trades assembly. It Is also declared that the team *ters' union has decided to obstruct all street cars as much as possible by keeping their vehicles on the car Tracks. It is a matter of note that no striker has been involved In any of the disturbances that have taken place ä-nd no street car man has so far been Placed under arrest.
