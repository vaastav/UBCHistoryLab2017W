A Confidential Clerk in the Office of the First Comptroller of the Treasury Makes Some Damaging Allegations of Irregular Disbursements of Public Moneys "ft ork for the Springer Committee. Washington, d . C., December 5. There were lively proceedings before the Springer Committee to-day. J. J. Barker, confidential law clerk in the office of the First Comptroller of the Treasury, was heard in response to the following letter : Washington , I). C., December 2. Hon. Wm. M. Springer, Chairman: Sir ;—October 24, 1884, I wrote an open letter to the President, citing in stances of wrongful extraction of public funds from the Treasury. I have no copy, of that letter here, but inclosed is an edi torial from the Cincinnati Enquirer of October 28th, to give an idea of its main points. I am especially familiar with the. manner in which accounts are adjusted, in the judiciary division of the First Comp troller's office. In this division the ac counts of commissioners, clerks, attor neys, marshals, etc., of theFederal Courts are finally passed upon. Vouchers on file in the Register's office will furnish evi dence of the fact that for years it nas been the rule to make illegal allowsrjces to; these officials through the Compi/i'oller s office, by design, or inexcusable ignor ance of the provisions of the law. I insist that more than half of the ac counts presented by the court officials contain illegal or improper charges; many of these items are allowed. These im-, proper allowances will aggregate _ an. enormous sum. Convincing proof of this statement w ill be found in the file rooms of the Kegis-i ter's office, but the evidence can only be produced by some one well-informed con cerning the contents of the books and lo cation of vouchers. When investigations of those matters have been attempted, only those papers asked for by resolution have been exhibited. Persons being investigated do not usu ally volunteer evidence tending toward their own condemnation. Of course in the limits of this letter, I cail only briefly indicate the things com plained of, but I should be very glad to furnish your committee with details. Very respetfully, J. J. Barker. Barker consumed considerable time citing instances where alleged fraudulent vouchers were presented by United States officials and allowed by order of Comp troller Lawrence in the face of protest by himself (Barker). He said that United States Commissioner Shields, of New York, presented an account of fourteen hundred dollars for swearing super visors of election of 1880, to their ac counts, when the statute provided other means of payment of the service. He had protested against the allowance of this voucher, yet the allowance was made. United ^States District Attorney Stone, of Western Pennsylvania, had filed a voucher for $60 per diem in term of court, where there were but four cases far trial, one of which was disposed of by demurrer, another nolled and the other two continued. The account was allowed without inquiry. In the eleceion of 1882 in New York, a voucher for §23,000 was allowed for su pervisors of election, when it was shown that the supervisors were paid from §5 to $10 for two days' service, but one day each was all the service required, and no evidence was produced to show that more service than one day was necessary. The examination proceeded at considerable length, and is still progressing. 

LAYING SPOOKS. The Mystery of Mystic on the Sound Satis factory Solved—A ValUant Youth In Fe male Attire Captures a Ghost and Lands Him In the Arms of the taw. New London, Conn ., Decembers. Three ghosts have been frightening tht women and children of the quaint littlt village of Mystic on the Sound, eight oi ten miles east of here, for' several weeks Women and girls were at first pursued almost nightly by a tall, white figure thai rose np suddenly from the way side, and seemed to their affright ed vision to float swiftly on tht wind toward them. They spec down the street closely chased by the ap parition and dashed into their homes oui of breath and fell on the floor. At length the terror became so general that few •women and girls ventured out of theii houses after dark, and when they did so, hurried along their roads, often turning ,an affrighted glance over their shoulders lest the three ghosts might steal on them unawares. Next a company of young men was or ganized to lie in wait, with loaded shot guns, for the ghostly disturbers of the peace, and several parties staid out all night for a week or more at different points about the village, lying on the frosted grass behind w-alls and fences, or in the phadow of unlighted buildings. No spec ter appeared in tiie silent streets, and the watchers went home and thawed out in the chimney place with draughts of hot cider. Thereupon a committee of two or three young men arrayed themselves in hoop skirts, dresses and bonnets, and after dark minced coquettishly up and down the sidewalks hoping to lure the ghosts into pursuing them. For two nighte the ruse was without results, but a few evenings ago one of the ghosts was tempted out. He sprang at one of. the masqueraders, who al first fled, leading the ghosl Ion, until he suddenly wheeled, and ; throwing his arms around the ghost, held him in a merciless hug. The captive wai ïugged before a police justice, who hac him locked up. The ghost was Albert C. Briggs, a jack-of-all-trades of the village •He was sentenced to thirty days in jail foi disturbing the peace. Who the othei ghosts are is not known, as Briggs refuse* to expose them. They have not beei gees since his arrest. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.. The Last General Communie of President Arthur to Congress. itioiï. ABeview of Our Domestic an'l Foreign Belations and of Our Mora Pressing Needs. The President Expresses His Sense, of. Obligation to Ali Parties For Their Support. Washington, D. C., December 1'. To the Congress of the United States: Since the close of your last session the American people in the exercise of their highest right oi suffrage have chosen their Chief Magistrate for the four.years ensu ing. When itisreinemberëdthat at no period intiiç country's history has the long political con test which customarily precedes the day ot the Rational election been waged with greater fervor and intensity, it is a subject oi con gratulation that after the controversy at the polls was over, and while the slight prepon derance by which the issue had been deter mined was as yet unascertained, the publie peace suffered no distubrance, but it he peo ple everywhere patiently and quietly await ed the result. Nothing could more striking ly illustrate the temper of the American citi zen, Iiis love of order, and his loyalty to law. Nothing could more signally demonstrate* the strength and wisdom of our political in stitutions. the electoral vote. Eight years have passed since a con troversy concerning the result of »National election sharply called the attention of Con gress to the necessity of providing mora definite regulations for the counting of the electoral vote. . It is of the gravest importance that this question be solved before conflicting claims to the Presidency shall again distress the country, and I am persuaded that by the ■ people at large any of the measures ol relief thus far proposed would be preferred to con tinued inaction. foreign relations. "'| Our relations with all foreign powers con tinue to be amicable. With Belgium a con vention has been signed whereby the scope of the present treaties has been so enlarged as to secure to the citizens of either country within the jurisdiction of the other equal rights and privileges. In the acquisition and alienation of property a trade mark treaty has also been concluded. The war between. Chili and Peru is at an end. For the arbitra tion of the claims of American citizens,who, during its continuance, suffered through the acts of the Chilian authorities, a convention will soon be negotiated. V china. 1 The state of hostilities between France and China continues to be an embarrassing feature of our Eastern relations. The( hints« Government has promptly adjusted and paid the claims of American citizens, whose prop ertv was destroyed in the recent riots at Canton. 1 renew the recommendation oi ray last annual message, that the Canton in demnity fund be returned to China. Ihe true interpretation of the recent treaty with that country, permitting the restriction or Chinese immigration, is likely to be again the subject of your deliberations. It may be seriouslv questioned whether the sta-.ute passed at the last session does not vioxate the treaty rights of certain Chinese who left this country with return certificates valid under the old law and now seem to be de - baired from landing from lack of eertuicate.i required by the new. The recent purchase by'the United States of a large trading fleet heretofore under the Chinese flag has con siderably enhanced our commercial im portance in the East. In view of the -large number of vessels built or purchased by American citizens ;n other countries and exclusively employed in legitimate traffic between foreign ports un der the recognized protection ot our flag, ig might be well to provide a uniform rate lor their registration and documentation, so that the bona Ilde property rights of our citizens therein shall be duly evidenced and properly guarded. the congo country. Pursuant to the advice of the Senate at the last session, I recognized the flag or tne In ternational Association of the Congo as that of a friendly Government, avoiding in so do ing any prejudgment of conflict.

International Conference for the considera tion of this subject was called by the l mj)( r or of Germanv, and is now in session al i.er lin. Delegates are in attendance on behalf of the United States. Of the results ol the conference, you will be duly adv ised.
