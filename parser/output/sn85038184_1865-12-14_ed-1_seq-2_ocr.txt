BJSU The SOtlt Congress commenced on tho 4th inst., nnd was duly organized: Mr Fester acting Vice President presiding in tho Senate, and Schuyler Colfax being duly elect ed Speaker of the House of Representatives by an unprecedented inujority: McPhcrson Clerk. Chaplain and all officers being chos en from the Union party. On the organization of the House, it will be seen from the publication of the proceed ings, thnt those who proffw to represent tho states lately in rebellion xccre excluded from all participation in Un organization, nnd that the question of their future admission, together with the conditions on which they will be admitted to scats, if nt nil, wns referred to n joint committee of the two Houses, whose report in all probability will finally settle this vexed question. It will also be seen from accounts which we publish, that the Ohio Delegation through n Caucus hid the preceding week, adopted res olutions indicating the course which wns ulti mately pursued by Congress on its organiza tion, in rcgnrd to the Representatives from States luto'y in rebellion, which is highly com. mendable, as it is indicative of their future policy. Beyond question, it is necessary to define the terms nnd conditions on which the Representatives of thoso lately in rebellion, shall mingle with those of the loyul people, and the; manner and mode in which it is about being done, is the proper one. BQi. The assemblage of tho United Stntcs Congress, is necessarily accompanied by n great mass of documents, which are laid be- foro that body by the Executive Departments through the President, including the Message, which truly constitute un array of documents, tho most importunt of which we feci it oblig atory to lay before our renders. Consequent ly, happening to bo nt Cincinnati when the j message &c, were received, we had the good fortune to procure from the "Gazette" office extra copies of the Presidents Message, to gether with a partial report of Secretary Mc- Culloch and other valuable publications, which wo had the pleasure of distributing nmong our subscribers the following Friday. To-dny we lay beforo our readers a synopsis of the highly valuablo report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which gives a comprehens ive and satisfactory exhibit of the financial condition of this Department, running into 1807, and looking to tho ultimate extinguish mcnt of tho national indebtedness. We will hereafter, as the crowded columns of our pa per shall permit!! like manner furnish state ments of tho reports of the other departments of the Eexeeutive Government, including that of tho Postmaster General, until all these valuable papers shall bo duly laid before our readers. In tho meantime we will continue our nsu al report of the daily roceedings of Congress. Smuggling on the Canada Fron tier. . This species of unlawful trade has become quite prevalent, nnd to cover a large value of merchandise thus surreptitiously introduced into our country free of import duty, nnd in its progress many artifices ore resorted to, to deceive onr vigilant officials: nmong which may be enumerated, tho vast number of "ba bies" carefully wrapt in shawls" which wore carried acioss the lines in woman's ttaheart arms, but nono nppears to return. On inves tigation by curious officials, it wns discovered that nine-tenths of the tleepinff babies were nothing less than tin cam, corresponding in size nnd shape to babies, filled with choice liquors. The best dodge reported in this con nection, represents our officials interposing with a funeral cortege, which having just passed into our territory for the interment of somo deceased person accompanied by nu merous Keeping 'friends, On opening the coffin, lo and behoH, instead of a cold and gastly corpse, it contained a choice and val uable lot of silk goods! Persons from De troit and its surroundings bnve also crossed to Canada, almost in a nude state, and in a short time thereafter have returned, covered with new habiliments! The revenuo laws howev er being rigidly enforced, the last M well as tho other species of trade appear to be pretty well suppressed, but what new and further arti fice will be resorted to remains to be seen. S A Raleigh paper gives the following good advice,to the North Carolina Legisla ture : "Pass the constitutional amendment unnni" monsly, in the first place. That must be donei for if left undone all else that may be done will be as nothing. Then pass a law allowing the blacks to testify in the courts of justice; that is not only necessary to enable the State to get back into the Union, but justice and good policy demand it Then give the blacks perfect equality before the law, as far as per sonal protection and the rights of property are concerned, and let him rest Do this, gentlemen of the Assembly, and you will have discharged you duty to the State and coun try, and done full and complete justice to the inferior race."

If the expenditures for the remaining three- quarters of tho present fiscal year shall equal t!ie estimates, there will be a deficiency, to be provided for by loans, of $112,194,047 20, to which must be added 832.53(3,001 for the 'five pet cent. Treasury notes, (pnrt of the public debt,) which becomes due the present month, and are now being paid out of moneys in the ircasury, ana all otner payments whicu may be made on the public debt The heavy expenditures of the last fiscal year, and of the months of July and August ol tho profcnt hscnl year, arc tlio result ot the gigantic sca!e on which the war wns prosecu ted, during a portion of this period, and the payment of the officers and men mustered out of the service. The large estimates of the War IJeparlinent tor the rest ot the year are for the payment of troops which are to remain in the service, nnd of 'those which nro to be discharged, and for closing up existing bal ances. The statement of the probable receipts and expenditures for the next fiscal year is, in the highest degree satisfactory. According to es timates which are believed to be reliable, the receipts of that year will be sufficient to pay all current expenses of the Government, the interest on the public debt, and leave the handsome balance of $111,682,818 12 to be applied toward the pay mcut of the debt itself." On the final pnymcnt of the national debt the Secretary remarks : ."When tho whole debt shall be put in such n form that the interest only can be demand ed, until the Government shall be in a con dition to pay the principal it can bo easily managed. It is undeniably large, but the re sources of the country are even now ample to carry and gradually reduce it; and with the labor question nt the South ssttled on terms just to the employer and to the laborer, and with entire harmony between the ditlerent sections, it will oe rapidly diminished, in burden nnd amount, by tho growth of the country, without an increase pt taxation. The following estimate of the time which would be required to pay the national debt (if lundcd at live per cent and at hve and one- halt per cent; by the payment ot two hun dred millions of dollars annually on tho in terest and principal, and also of the diminu tion of the burden of the debt by the increase of productions, muy not be without interest to Longrcss nnd to tax payers. The national debt, deducting moneys in the Treasury, wns, on the 3Utof October, 1865, $2,740,854,750. Without attempting a nice calculation of the amount it may reach when all our liabilities shall be accurately as certained, it seems safe to estimate it, on the 1st of July, 1866, at three thousand millions of dollars. The exact amount of existing in debtedness yet unsettled, and the further amount that may accrue in the interval, Sire not now capable of exact estimation, and the reyenue of the same period can be only ap proximately calculated, but it will be safe to assume tnttt the debt will not exceed tne sum named. - The annual interest upon three ' thousand millions, if funded at five and a half per cent per annum, would be one hundred and sixty five millions, hut if funded at five per cent it would be one hundred and fifty millions. Now, if two hundred millions per annum should be applied, in half-yearly installments of one hundred millions each, in payment of tne accruing interest ana in reduction ot the Driocioal funded at the hieher rate of five and a half per cent, the debt would! be en tirely paid in thirty-two and oneeigbtb years. At five per cent per annum, it would be ex tinguished by the like application of one hun dred-millions every six months, in a little' over twenty-eight years. At tne higher rate, nr sun applied in the first year in the reductieo of the principal of the debt would be; thirty-five millions of dol lars; in the last or thirty-seemtd year, when the interest wonld be diminished to a little over nine millions, about one hundred and !MHI!5!!BnSH!5!H! ninety-one millions of tho uniform annual payment Vvould go to ' the reduction of t,he tirinpinnl ' i - f i .i y- ,- j- On the subject of coin the Secretary further romarks:'1! . '.-..'Ji; ' . ' "Tho receipts of coin have been for some months past so large that there have been constant accumulations beyond what has been required for tho payment of the interest on the public debt The Secretury hns, therefore, deemed it to bo his duty to sell, from time to time, a portion of the surplus for the purpose of supplying tho wants of importers, and fur nishing the means for meeting the demands upon the Treasury for currency. The sales have been conducted by the Assistant Treas urer in New Yorioin a manner entirely satis factory to the Department, and, it is believed, to the public. The soles, np to the 1st of November, amounted to ?i,y.'-'o n, and the premium to S12.310.45fl 76; thus placing in the Treasury for current use, the sum of $40,303,675 87, without which there .would have been a necessity for the further issue of interest-bearing notes. Tho necessities of tho Treasury have been such that a complinnco with the requirements ot the act ot F ebruary !, JSoz, lor tno crea tion of a sinking fund has been impracticable. As long as it is necessary tor the Ltovern mont to borrow money, nnd to put its obliga tions upon the market for salo, the purchase ot these obligations for the purpose ot crea ting a sinking fund would hardly bo judicious. After tho expiration of the present year, the incouie of the Government will exceed its ex penses; and it will then be practicable to curry into effect the provisions of the law. ine secretary is, nowerer, oi tno opinion mat the sato and simple wnyot sinking tno nation al debt is to nppry directry to its pnymcnt the exoess of receipts over expenditures. ' Ho thercforo respectfully recommends thnt so much of the net of February 25, 1862, as re quires the npplica'ion of coin to the purchase or payment ot one per cent ot the entire debt ot the United Mntcs,to be set apart asa sink ing lund, be repealed. . ' liy virluo of the authority conferred by the fifth section of the act of Mareh 3, 1863, the Ireasurerot the l;nitctl htates, and tho As sistant Treasurer in New York, have been in structed to receive deposits of coin and bul lion, nnd to issue certificates therefor in de nominations of not loss than twenty dollars. lustrations wero given for the issuo of these certificates to promote the convenience of officers of customs nnd for the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurers, and for the accom modation of the public. Other considerations also prompted the Secretary to avail himself ot tho authority reterrea to. Jt is expected that tho credit of the Government will be strengthened by the coin which will be thus brought into the Treasury, and that the effect of the measure will be to facilitate, to some extent, a return to specie payments. If the experiment should be satisfactory in New York, it will be extended to other commercial cities." NfcWS OF THE DAT, Washington, Dec. 7.

PATIHOTIO LADY. A thank offering of fifteen dollars was re ceived bv tho Secretary of the Treasury to day from a widow lady in New York. In a letter containing the remittance she states the amount is five per cent of what she is worth, and having had a son in the service, although he came back to her broken down in health, she was yet thankful for his return, and forwnrdpd the money as her nronortion of the war debt She also desired to know how much of the national debt would remain unpaid if every adult in the country should send five per cent of his or her property, nnd how much more her share would be in pay ing off the debt entirely.
