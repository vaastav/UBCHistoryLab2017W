Chilton Smells a Mouse. P Joe Chilton hastened to Washing3&;-! ton when lie learned that some ol pB the Democratic congressmen-elect who are publicly regarded as owing 5,"their election to certain sources, ' were entering into a compact, foj ' selfish purpose. i. Did he break up the plot? II seems that he v.as Impressed agalr , with the adage that sometimes ht who Is the beneficiary or others it not always grateful. Witness the following from a Washington dis1 patch: "The West Virginia Democrat^ contingent In Washington was further augmented today ljy the arrival of the Hon. Joe Chilton, whe took pains during his short stay tc keep aloof from other West Virginia Democrats like the Cornwell broth * erst-.tAndy Price and F. R. Hill, ol :Marlington; Congressman-elect l-.lt-tlepage and Senator George iPrice, ol Pocahontas. It was told Chilton. _ that the above named, with Con.* gressman-elect Davis. of Clarksburg had b^en. conferring conifldeutlally presumably on the senatorshlp. and Chilton's reply was a prediction thai Clarence W. Watson wou'd be the senator, and he Intimated that dark horse ambitions on the part of Davis and. Cornwell had best be put on cold storage. " It Is apparent that the Watson managers have information of letlota written to legislators by Corn well and Davis supporters, suggest, ing that a combination can be made to beat Watson with either one named above. "It was suspected ,l>y the Watson managers that the visit here of Lit tlepage. Davis and Cornwell was to fix up an anti-Watson combination, hut Littlepage tonight declares that no conference was held, tlyit neither he nor Davis has designs on the senatorship and thnt both have agreed to keep out and be faithful to their trust as representatives in the House only. There was some emphasis on the Littlepage declaration tonight, even In behalf of Davis, who went home last night. One result of the conferences here between Democrats nam-ed has been artful intimations that sentiment in agricultural sections of the state is being worked up against Watson, and also in southern Industrial sections, where Watson is a stranger." Red Cross Pictures. u The National Association for the p study and prevention of tuberculosis has announced a motion pic. lure flint* entitled "The Red Cross Seal.** to 'be exhibited throughout the United States December 15, in connection with the campaign against tuberculosis. The fllm, which is 1,000 feet long f is produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company and portrays a story of New York life. Ellen Williams. a poor girl of tlie tenement district, but young and pretty, who makes her living by decorating lamp i : shades, applies to an art school for a course of study, but is unable tt procure the cost. ?iuu. as ?? turns to leave the office she is seen "by a young man of wealth, who If t;' struck with the pathos of her beauty and disappointment. Tired or his purposeless life, Jordan resolves tc soe for himself how "the other half' JTves. Dressed as an ordinary day ; < laborer he rents a room in the same tenement and soon becomes greutly attached to Rllen. A prize of $100 haa been offered for the best Ret IAPer I t- Cent A ^ ^ [ Crone seal design. and . Jordan sees I Ellen enter the contort and finally win the prize. Just as she is about t to realice her longed-for course lA , art, however, a neighbor's boy eontracts the deadly consumption and ' she generously applies the money to j a course of treatment for the con sumptive at a sanitarium. Jordan is struck by such a noble ' BAA.IAaa en/1 Vtuvo anH ronoirofnn ' the tenement, providing against fu, ture infection. When he reveals to Ellen his identity and proposes that : she share his mansion on Fifth ave| nue, she finds that after all the Red Cross seal and her sacrifice have ! brought her lave, home and the sat isfactton of her ambition. : Steal Is On llgsln. ft bglns to develop why Democratic legislators-elect held a recent meeting in Parkeraburg. Announcement was made that the object of the meeting was primarily to come to some understanding as to proposed legislation and secondarily to see what could be done to organize ' the legislature, especially the State ' Senate, which will be a tie, according to the returns of the recent election. Xo sooner had the confab ceased than announcement was made of ' two contests as to the membership of the State Senate. One was from the First senatorial district, where a man named Caldwell had already had a recount in one of the big counties and lost. He suddenly discovered that there had been irregularities, so-called, in smaller counties of bis district, but he gave no intimation of the thought until after the confab at Parkeraburg. Xext. the public has the spectacle of a Democrat in another senatorial district with but one vote to his credit filing a contest against a Republican senator-elect. who received nearly eight thousand votes and had no rominated opposition. This act also happen derl after the confab at Parkers' burg. Under the circumstances. asj quoted, and in view of the fact that! | Lhe Democratic party did steal the governorship of this tate once, when i General Nathan Goff, now judge,! was elected, is there any wonder that the puiic believes there is a steal planned now? Wasted Advice. President Taft said in his message I that the recent abundance of iegisla- I tion had reached such dimensions! that we can stop for a while and observe the effect of the execution of the laws we already enjoy without enacting: more. On the same (lay. notes the New York Times, 558 bills were introduced in the "House, not to mention several amendments of the rules of procedure more important than most of the bills, or perhaps than any of them. The gentlemen who introduced these'bills are among those who complain that the message has no teeth in it. and who are prepared to introduce a bill to cure anything that anybody complains of. Having so monv r^nioHins thpv naturallv have no use for the rest cure for the country's case of nervous prostration. What are a pitiful 500 bills when ho country is suffering from so many troubles? What is wanted Is thousands of hills, millions of laws. These bustling gentlemen are weary already of the humdrum conditions which contrast so strongly with tlie regretted past when each fresh day brought its novelty and excitement. There could not he too much of that to please them, and naturally they canont understand the sentiment which the President so well expressed that the country could not have too little legislation tUa ?nrf r?f which it lias had too much. Check on Yellow Journalism. The Century Magazine invites attention to the recent utterances of Mayor Gaynor, of New York City, on the question of the yellow press of the country and suggests the advisability of a movement to check the growth of unbridled defamation from this quarter, i .Under the guise of devotion to the cause of the dear 'people, says the Philadelphia Record, there is a growing miinher of publications in this country ? daily newspapers, magazines o:id weekly periodicals? i whose editors and writers pay little attention to the truth when the matter under consideration is a "good story.*' or one which furnishes op? -* >"<?" fm. /'ppntin? the aimed-at !impression that the publication in| 1 which it appears is more devoted to

Honest newspaper men no less than the victims of the yellow journal methods are interested in suppressing this growing .evil. It might be a gehif start in this direction If. instead it Ignoring the work of the pernicious yellow journal, the other style oT JflurKal. and others affected, should immediately, upon such evidence of misrepresentation. brand the fake. City Mini on Farm. It is true enough that farming today is one of the most attractive of occupations. There Is more money in it than ever before. It is little less than criminal, however, to Induce city dwellers, who know nothing of planting, to give up positions and move to a new and wild country. there to lead the lffe of pioneers, although they are wholly unfitted for it. It Is a mistake to^thlnk that anybody can farm. It requires skill. Just as every other vocation requires skill. City dwellers who wish to go in for farming should settle In an old farming district, where there are willing farmers to advise and aid them and where the conditions are not those or the frontier. "Moreover, it is hopeless for city men to move to farms unless thdy> own them ' 0 fee and have sufficient money to weather a disastrous season. It is undoubtedly true 'that a great many people would lie better off in the country than In the city Families have to return to the soil a't given periods in order to regain vitality. The difficulty now is that the movement of farm boys to the towns is not balanced .by a counter movement of city boys to the farms. We do not think this latter movement will ever l?e of great magnitude t'intil holding companies are formed which will furnish sufficient capital to guarantee a living until former | city men. have become skilled in j farm management. "Mamma, what's a seal?" askod eight-year-old Mary, looking up from the paper whose black headlines she was-laboriously decipherings "A seal is a little animal that lives in the ocean. We use Its fur for coats and wraps,*' was the enlightening an- > ! swer of the parent. Mary puckered her brow for some 1 minutes, and again interrogated, 4 Mamma, will seals stop plagues?" | referring perhaps to some of the ; Bibical narratives she had heard told In Sunday school. "Stop plagues! Why. child, what are you talking about?" cried the mother In amazement. "Why here it says, 4Red Cross Seals Stop White Plague,4 " triumphantly holding up the paper. Then mamma explained to her little girl that the Red Cross Seal is a tiny slahip-like sticker which is placed on the back of leters and packages coming from Santa Clans Ideal Gi Christ Select your gifts early the largest and most comple
