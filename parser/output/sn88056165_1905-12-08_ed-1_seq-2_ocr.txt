Despite all the denials at the meet ing of the American league in Chicago of any amalgamation between the Na tional and American leagues there are some of the magnates who honestly believe that some such move will be made. It now looks as though Matty Fitz patrick would be the next match for Honey Melody. The Chicago boy has been trying to get a go with Gardner or Sullivan, but has about given up hope as the two latter men claim to be lightweights. Now Fitzpatrick comes out with the statement that he is after Mellody and wants to fight the Boston boy in San Frnacisco. Jack Kerns, matchmaker of the 20th Century Athletic club, at Spokane, an nounces that he has matched Kid Scaler of Spokane and Kid Harrison of Salt Lake to box 20 rounds before that club December 15.

Army and Navy Even. Princeton, N. J.—Army 6, navy 6. While the army-navy football game Saturday was probably one of the most exciting ever played between the two institutions, it was simply a side show to the. social football event of the season. The 25,000 people saw the game. From all sections of the United States came spectators who or dinarily would not travel a score of miles to see a football contest. All this was doubtless brought about by the fact that President Roosevelt was to be present. Standing at end of Pacific coast league season: P. C.

CONGRESS RESUMED MONDAY'S SESSION BEGINNING OF MOST IMPORTANT MEETING. Message Tuesday—Preliminary Work Only Will Occupy Attention for a Week—New Senators Appear—In Upper House There Will Be Four to Take the Oath. Very little besides the organization of the house will be accomplished the first week of the session, although it is possible that an emergency appro priation for the Panama canal may be passed the last of the week. Un til the committees are appointed such a bill would have to be considered by unanimous consent or under a special order. The leaders of the house have been informed that the emergency appropri ation will not be needed until Decem ber 25, and consequently the bill may not be passed until next week. Monday was taken up with the elec tion of a speaker and other house of ficers. It is already understood that the rules of the last house will be adopted, as the members have been sworn in. The biennial lottery for seats was an interesting occasion on the first day, and at its conclusion ad journment followed. Tuesday was de voted to the reading of the president's message, and that closed the real busi ness of the house for the week. Speaker Cannon has not yet com pleted his committees, but it is expect ed he win be ready to announce them early in the session. Bills will be introduced every day that the house is in session from the beginning, and will be printed and re ferred tor the committees when ap pointed. It is expected that many im portant propositions will be presented during the early days of the session. Work in Senate. Nothing but preliminary work will engross the attention of the senate this first week of the session. The senate is already organized, as it is a continuous body, and besides, there was a special session last spring, when the new senators were sworn in. Senators Brandegee of Connecticut, Warner of Missouri, Frazier of Ten nessee and LaFoilette of Wisconsin have not yet taken their oaths. The two former had not been elected when the special session adjourned. Monday was a very short session and the senate adjourned out of re spect for the late Senator Platt of Con necticut as soon as the necessary for malities for the beginning of a new congress have been concluded. Tues day the president's message was re ceived and read, and Wednesday was devoted to the introduction of bills. A short session was held Thursday, and the senate then adjourned until the following Monday. 

THREW AT ROOSEVELT TRAIN. Deadly Chunk of Iron Hurled Into Car In Quaker City. Some unknown person hurled a heavy iron plumbbob through the win dow of one of the cars of President Roosevelt's special train on the run from Princeton to Washington.

B. Hayes, who was a guest of the presi dent on the trip to the army and navy football game. Fragments of the broken glass fell upon Major Hayes, who was sitting with his back to the window, but did not injure him. IN 

DARK AS TO MOSCOW. Last News From There Is of Pillage and Arson. Berlin, Dec. 5.—Absence of news from Moscow leads to the worst con clusions in respect to that city's fate. The latest information was that the old capital was in the hands of mobs that sacked and burned all the gov ernment buildings, and the police and Cossacks pillaged the imperial gran eries and cut the telegraph wires. It is evident the last line of communica tion was severed at least 24 hours ago and that Moscow is isolated, not only from the world, but from the remain der of Russia. Roosevelt Married 19 Years. Nineteen years ago Saturday, at St. George's church, London, Canon Guth ridge performed the ceremony which made Theodore Roosevelt, now presi dent of the United States, and Miss Edith Carew, of New ¥ork, man and wife. Canon Guthridge was selected because he was a cousin of the bride, who was then traveling in Europe with her mother and sister. The Pennsylvania railroad is plant ing trees so as to provide crossties for use 15 or 20 years from now. in of RECORD OF LIFE 8AVER8. Thousands of Persons Rescued and Many Crafts Saved. The work of the life saving service for the last fiscal year is summed up in a report of General Superintendent Kimball to the secretary of the treas ury, recently made public. The life "saving crews saved and assisted in saving 464 imperiled vessels and their cargoes, besides affording assistance of more or less importance to 677 oth er vessels, including craft of ail kinds, making a total of 1141 vessels to which aid was furnished. In addition, the report states, 83 steamers and 88 sail ing vessels running into danger were warned of their peril by the signals of the patrols and lookout in time to escape disaster. The saving of many lives and much property is attributed to such warnings. No less than 365 disasters to docu mented vessels occurred during the period stated, inyolving the lives of 4809 persons, of whom 27 were lost. The estimated value of vessels and cargoes so affected was $10,320,660, of which $7,917,385 was saved. Sixty three vessels were totally lost. Succor was afforded at the various stations to 624 persons, to whom an aggregate of 1510 days' relief was furnished. Four hundred and twenty casualties were sustained by undocumented vessels, such as sail boats and row boats, in volving 955 persons, 10 of whom were lost. The value of property involved in these casualties is estimated at $264,690, of which $258,025 was saved. The report concludes with an earn est appeal for pensions to widows and children of members of the life sav ing crews losing their lives in the performance of duty and for retire ment when disabled from injury or dis ease incurred in the service. MINING NOTE8. A special from Goldfield states that the great Kendall mine, owned princi pally by United States Senator Nixon and George Wingfield, is the mining sensation of the hour. To date two consignments, aggregating more than seven tons, of ore that is worth $60 per pound, have been deposited in the vault of the John S. Cook bank. Ac cording to careful sampling, this pre cious stuff is worth $119,000 a ton. A 3 per cent dividend aggregating $405,000, has been declared by the shareholders of the Granby Consoli dated Mining, Smelting & Refining company. The Granby mines and smelter are located at Phoenix, B. C., and Grand Forks, B. C., respectively, constituting the largest mining and smelting en terprise under one company in Can ada. The ore is copper-gold, carry ing principal values in copper, and being a low grade, self fluxing prod uct. Granby shares have advanced on the New York curb from $3.50 to par for the $10 shares within 12 months. Two prospectors took out $5000 in gold from one pocket near Gold Bay, Ore., last Saturday, according to a statement of E. R. Ray of Medford. The full capacity of eight furnaces is now running at the Granby smelter, treating about 2500 tons of ore daily. The three shifts of eight hours re cently commenced are working with out a hitch, there being now over 300 men employed as a result of the eight hour system being inaugurated. Nighthawk, Wash.—The Prize Min ing company has struck a new ore shoot on Mount Elemeham, which as says $125 a ton. A big deal is now on foot in Lar deau camp, B. C., that may mean much for that district. The Metropolitan and Tryune groups, upon which the last payment has recently been made by the Metropolitan Gold & Silver Mining company, may be sold to the Broadway syndicate. Elk City, Idaho.—After many delays due to changes the cyanide mill of the CrookejJ River Mining & Milling com pany is at last running steadily. This is the first mill of the sort to be in stalled in the district, and owners of other low grade dykes have been watching with interest the experiment by this company. A reduction of five cents a ton has been made voluntarily by the Canadian Pacific railroad in the trans portation rate on ore from Rossland to Trail. The Gold Coin mine, near Durkee, is to open this winter. It is located 20 miles southeast of Baker City. It has an abundance of free milling gold ore. Just south of the state capitol build ing at Helena, Mont., and within the city limits, E. Hahn has struck a 20 foot vein, with a pay streak one foot wide, which averages from $30 to $33 a ton in gold, silver and lead. The strike was made at a depth of 14 feet. Albuquerque.—Joseph Johnson and Peter McGann, on Belen cutoff, were blown to atoms at Camp No. 6, also John Mclsaacs, foreman, was injured. The v cause of the explosion is un known but it is thought to have re sulted from thawing out dynamite. Lord Templemore, the "father of the house of lords," sat in that body for 28 years before he delivered his maid en speech, and his effort consisted of 21 words. in of a of a of ly • DEMANDS REJECTED RAILWAY EMPLOYES AT WARSAW JOIN TELEGRAPHERS' STRIKE. Government Will Not Concede a Point —Thirty-Four Provinces in 8tate of Insurrection—Situation It Desperate —Police at Warsaw, Poland, Said to Be Powerless. Warsaw, Poland, Dec. 4. —The gov ernment has rejected all of the de mands of the railway employes, and the latter have joined with the tele graphers in their strike. Large crowds of strikers are pa trolling the various depots and are re fusing to let any of the "weak kneed'' return to their posts. The police are powerless to prevent incendiary as semblages at which the speakers con tinue to urge an uprising in force. The soldiers having been withdrawn from patrol duty, the work is thrown upon the police, who are thoroughly inadequate. An army officer, who has just ar rived from Sebastopol, states that im mediately after the capture of the mutineers there, drumhead courtmar tials were held, at which Lieutenant Schmidt, leader of the uprising, and all of the warrant officers from the fleet who participated were ordered shot to death. More than 200 were killed in this way before the officer who brought the Story here left there. He said that the workingmen are arming themselves and that the situa tion in southern Russia is desperate in the extreme. Thirty-four provinces of Europe Russia, excluding Poland, Finland and the Caucasus, are now in a state of insurrection, and the old time regime is at an end. These provinces have a population of 58,000, 000, or more than half of the popula tion of Europe Russia. December Attractions at The 8pokane. Dec. 7-8—Britt Nelson Moving Picture.

Since owning the auto, Mme. Calve has made the trip to Nice and Monte Car lo in it, and she put in considerable time touring in Soutnern France and Italy. Calve has learned to run the car herself. Her chief pleasure once was found in driving horses so it is natural that sue should not be content until she cou- be her own chaffeur.
