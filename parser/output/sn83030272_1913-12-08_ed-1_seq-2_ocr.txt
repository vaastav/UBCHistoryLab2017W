Prlvnto de spatches received hero from Cludad 1'or fio Dlax, opposite ...irIo t'ass, Tex., In dicate that the Carraiizlsta. movement has omplotely paralyzed coal mining In tho aorthtrn part of Coahulla. All this lm aienso coal mlnlnc district Is deserted nnd Sot a pound of coal has been extracted Hnc last February. All tha mines have either been totally 4atroyed or filled with water as a re nit of tho operations of the rebels In that part of the State, Plants were dyna mited and the employees wero compelled to flea or to Join the rebels. These plants eould be repaired and trre mines could resume operations within six weeks If laborers and railroad cars cculd be ob tained. All the coal used by the smelt ins companies nnd the National Hallways In this part of the republic Is being Im ported from the United States at winter rates. Men Interested in tho rubber Industry throughout the country are Indignant over the new tax of fifteen centavos per kilo gram, which is being levied by the Gov ernment, as each case of rubber shipped here contains one hundred rounds and tha tax also applies to the weight of the Itnhhrr Price Inerenard. The prlco of rubber has greatly In creased recently nnd although It has now reached forty ents u pound thir tax eats up almost all tho profit. Many big rubber concerns, especially In the soutk arn part of the republic, havo discontin ued tapping nnd hundreds havo been thrown out of work. Much American cap ital Is involved tu this Industry in Mex ico. The Oovcrnment Is facing a recrudes cence of tho Zapatista movement In the State of Morelos.

How far tho Zapatista movement In Its present phase Is connected with the revolution In the north Is not regarded here. It Is clear that tho Zapatistas may now say they Mippuit Cairanz.i, but if Carranza, betamo I'riMdcnt It Is thought generally hcio that he would soon have the Zupatlstu problem on bis hands.
