2 president stands squarely for tariff re form of the Wilson variety, bnt ignore? the leeion taught by the last election, and assume! tbe people are anxious for a radical revision of the exisiting Bcheduleß. Hia allueion to the work of aiding people through the work of tariff reform ie misleading. For it is perfectly clear the people are suffering today aa the result of tbe general fear tbat the policy which he advocates will be carried out" The Philadelphia Telegraph: "The document makes a wilderness of wordß, coy ering every possible subject before the executive for his official cognizance, and gjvea far more attention to divers and sundry irrelevant and unimportant things than it does to others which are not only foremost in tbe public mind at thia time, but which must be earnestly conaidered, and for tbe time being, at least, definitely settled." The Philadelphia Bulletin says: "Tbe message is diaappointing in ita failure to deal mora cloeedy with the important queationa of policy which interest all his countrymen. F.ven thoae aubjecta on which be expresses emphatic opin ions are disposed of in sweeping general conclusions, rather than in exact state ments. Cleveland's mental reluctance or inability to grasp great questions at short range or in specific detail, has ■ever been more evident than in this de jeune document." Tne St. Louis Globe, Democrat: "It is, on the whole, a clear, well written and busirasaslike document, and, ex cept on the Hawaiian and aiiver ques tions, will prove fairly satisfactory to the country. The Hawaiian matter ia destined to make trouble for the ad ministration, and Mr. Cleveland ap pears to have a foreboding of this, but he proposes to adhere to the policy which he has maTked out. His views on tbe financial question are wiEe." The Bt. Louis Republic: "If the message outlines any special policy it is that he wsll be contont from the hour when his pen traces the name Urover Cleveland at tne bottom of the tariff reform bill, to be judged by hiscountry men aa an administrator." St. Paul Pioneer Press: "We can find in tbis message evidence only of tbe undesirable qualities of dullness and jealousy, that leave even to his partisans no room for enthusiasm over tbe beginning of thia administration." The Times (Democratic) eevereJy con demns the president's position on the Hawaiian queation and says he ia not to be congratulated on tbe astuteness with which he haa laid out tbe lines of retreat from hia unpopular aud unten able position. Tbe genera! tone of com ment is very unfavorable. The Inter-Ocean says: "The general tone of thia message is as common place aa the one of 1887 was eeneat oral " The record sayß: "The general motive oi the meaaage, aa a whole, may be eaid to be economy." The New York World aaya: "The meaaage, aa a whole, while it will not add greatly to Mr. Cleveland'a fame as a writer or leader, is a sensible, sincere, patriotic document." The Morning Advertiser aaya: "The people know what they may expect. A great fight ia before tbem, headed by the preeident himaelf. The free traders wili make a desperate effort to pass the Wilson bill, which, while it ia not a free trade measure, has in it a menace of the extention of our industries which we have all feared." Tbe Herald says: "The dominant note of tbe meaaage is prompt tariff re vision. All other mattera are subordi nated to thia, which Mr. Cleveland properly regards as the now over shadowing issue before congreea and the country." 

COAST COMMENT. How the San Francisco I'apers Slae Up the Message. San Francisco, Dec. 4.—The Call (Rep.j says editorially of Cleveland's message: "It covers a great deal of ground, but on points upon which in formation was looked for, little light is thrown. In respect to tbe tariff, as was expected, the result of the elections of '08 is disregarded. In respect to the Hawaiian problem tha message assumes as iac.ts statements which are evidently dioputed. Not less than nine-tenths of the message is a sum mary of department reports and a re statement of known fact?." The Examiner (Democratic) says one ol the moct important duties of the present adminiatration seeniß to be the reversal of the various policies initiated by Harrison. On tbe whole Mr. Cleve land has given us a good, busineas like meesage, one that promieea a session of congress fruitful in results of vulue to the country. The Chronicle (Iter.) says themes sage does not rife above toe dead level of mediocrity. It would bo difficult to conceive a more unsatisfactory treat ment of the silver question than that in the message. The president haß nothing new to a&y about tariff. 

BRITISH COMMENT. lvi President's Mesaage Commended For Its Frankness. London, Dec. 4.—The Daily News will lay oi Cleveland's mesaage: "Tbe message is well worthy of the national crisis in which it was delivered. The iuference from Mr.Cleveland'e facts and figures, whether intended or not, isthat it is the true policy to cultivate clo9e re lations with us. It seems generally agreed that the new tariff proposals will not largely affect our trade with the United States." The Chronica says: "In reference to Brazil and the Bering sea in l'resident Cleveland's message, there is nothing that might not bave been fathered by President Harrison. It is otherwise with reference to Hawaii. In awaiting Clevelands decision the friction that would probably have been caused there by interference at the time has been avoided. But the result is tbe same." In regard to reform of the tariff the Chronicle says: "While the president will have the good wishes of every sound economist in the battle he bas begun, it would be premature to regard it already won because tbe biggest batallionß are at present on his side." Tbe Telegraph says: "The portion of the message which displays President Cleveland at his best ia his reference to Hawaii. Such a frank and honeßt ad mission of a mistake and declaration of intention to reverse it, reflects tbe high est possible credit upon the president and indirectly upon tbe nation. Also, the president wbb evidently convinced tbat the American public would be magnanimous enough to uphold his action, and he waa probably right in so thinking." The Morfiing Post Bays: "President Cleveland's abstention from party rhet oric, at the expense of hia opponents, is all the more creditable as bis opportu nities for tbe employment of scathing invective were exceptional." The Post expresses surprise that the Hawaiian incident is mentioned in the message without any expression of shame or indignation. The Daily Graphio saye: "Mr. Cleve land ie to he congratulated upon hie tirr.mesH and conaistency." The Timea aaya : ''The portions of the message that bear upon foreign affairs are conceived in a highly creditable spirit. Considering thn Chauvinism of car American kicfolk, it is more creditable that the president has frank.. admimed the wrong done to Hawaii Mr. CSeveland would doubtless be in clined to go a good deal further than the Wilson bill, but recognizes the obstacle to progress, caused by thu deficit in the Wilson fcdU* He would benefit Ameri can workingmen and place the manu facturers upon something like a level with thefr foreign competitors. Whether these chvjtiges iv tbe long rnn will bene fit British industry and trade is doubt ful." Tbe Standard says : "From our point of view, ltd in spite of Mr. Cleveland's friendly altitude toward? England, we might almost regard the proposed new tariff aa tine work of an enemy. The natural conFequence is to create a new competitor fotr our business abroad, and we can only hope experience and benefit of cheap raw materials may lead to bet ter things in oether directions." 

BENNY WON'T TALK. The Kx-Presldant Declines to Discuss the President's Message. * Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 4. —Ex-Preßi- dent Harrieon declined to talk about the message. "The impropriety of an ex-president discussing publicly the president's meaaage," aaid ha, "is very palpable, and Ido not care to do bo. lam a Re publican and President Cleveland is a Democrat; consequently we differ radi cally in our views and opinions, and his ; suggestions and recommendations are j not in accordance with my ideas. I ; notice, however, he goes down tbe line j of departments and treat" of tbem fully. | Its length, too, is greater than the , average message." A 

BEAR POINT. Cleveland's Message Used to Depress Stocks. New York, Dec. 4.—There waa nothing left thie morning of the firmnesß with which the stock market closed Satur day. Speculation waß weak and sym pathized with the heavineaa of the Lon don market for American securities. The publication of tho president's mes sage in London in advance of its deliv ery to congress gave the atreet knowl edge of ita contente, and the fact that it made no mention of a contemplated bond issue, waß regarded as a bear point and helped to depreciate values. Ways and Means Committee. Washington, Dec. 4 —The ways and means committee met this morning and discussed the proceedure on the new tariff bill.

A letter to Louvois by Louis XIV. | written in cipher, lias been long in the archives of the ministry of war and has at length been deciphered. In it the king orders Louvois to arrest General do Burlonde for having raised the siege of Conti without permission, to send him to Pignerol and to conceal hia features under a loup, or black velvet mask. The order was executed, and the presumption is therefore violent that tlie "Man lv the Iron Mask"—it was a black velvet one with iron springs—waa Gen eral de Burlonde. The story tallies with the known fact that the prisoner made repeated attempts to communicate his name to soldiers; that he was treated with respect by his military jailers, and that Louis XV, who knew the truth of the whole affair, declared it to be a mat ter of no importance. The difficulty is to discover the king's motive for such a precaution, but he may have feared dis < , ,n; <ml it ii,i aiu lv* irrwi" •■»■ soldiery. It must, however, be possible to discover from the lists in the war office whether General de Burlonde was recorded as "missing" or "dead" about the right time.—Saturday Review. Tricks In All Trades. The young doctor was sitting in his consultation room chatting with a friend when some one entered the outer office. He stepped out, and the friend heard him say: "Pray take a seat. I'll be at liberty in a few minutes." Then he came back into the consulta tion room and closed the door after him. "I'll skip," said the friend. "Not for the world. Sit down," said the doctor. "But you have a patient waiting." "Well, it's a woman. Let her wait about 15 minutes." "You may lose her business." "On the contrary, I'll get it regularly. I always make them wait." "Why?" "To give the impression of a rush of business. It is the only way to keep a woman. If she thought I wasn't rushed to death, she'd lose confidence in me and go somewhere else."—Chicago Record. A Cabman's Ilevcnse. A good story is told of a stipendiary ; magistrate in a Yorkshire town, not given to err on the side of leniency, who heavily fined a cabman for fast driving. A few days after the magistrate, de tained rather longer than usual in the court, was hurrying along to catch his train when, seeing an emply c ab handy, he hailed the driver and directed him tc proceed to the station, telling him that lie was pressed for time. The driver, however, heedless of the hint, kept to a gentle trot. "I say, 1 say, my man,' exclaimed the fare, with his head out oi the window, "drivo faster than thisl" "It can't be done, sir," replied the driver. "Ye see, if we drives faster we'ro had up afore the 'beak,' and we gets fined, go we has to be careful." He did not I alter his pace, and neither did tho "-beak" i catch his train.—Loudon Tit-Bits.

FRIEND OF TRAMPS. Oovernor Lewelllug Issues an Extraor dinary Address. Topeka, Kaa., Dec. 4.—Governor Lew elling this afternoon issued a senea tional executive circular addreeeed to all the boards of metropolitan police cotnmiaaionere. Tbe circular, after picturing tbe dietreea existing in t lie United Statea and Europe, orders tbe police guards to arrest no tramps on the charges usually brought againat thia claas, namely, riding on freight cars, vagrancy, beg ging, etc. The governor says city or dinances fining tramps and com pelling them to work on rock piles and in bull pens are merely instruments to oppress the poor and unfortunate, and are un constitutional and opposed to the liber ties guaranteed by that instrument, and claaßea such punishment with tbe auc tion block. Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 4. —Tbe Times' Topeka epecial says: Governor Lswel ling has issued an extraordinary ad dress to all the boards of police commis sioners in Kansas, which practically renders nugatory all vagrant laws. He criticiees the manner in which tbe ex isting lawa are being enforced upon the unemployed, with regard to tbeir being ordered to leave town and move on. Thie, he says, ia • violation of the rights of per sonal liberty, guaranteed by the constitution of the United Statea, and there iB no power in the legislature, or city councils to deprive tbe people of thia right. He regarda the practice o! compelling vagranta to work out their lines in the workhoueea as a violation of a conatitutional provision, Ml<| calls on the police commissioners to carry out the spirit of these suggestions.
