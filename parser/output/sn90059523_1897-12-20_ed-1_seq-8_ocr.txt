8 BEHIND THE BARS ARE EXECUTIVE SESSIONS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE HELD. SECRETS CLOSELY GUARDED. DIPLOMATIC QIESTIOXS DISCUSSED WHICH SHOILD NOT BE MADE PUBLIC. THE FIB.ST SESSIONS WERE OPEN. Bonn- Interesting Communications In the Early Da>n of the Republic. Bprcial to the Globe. WASHINGTON. Dec. 18.— The execu tive sessions of the senate are, and al ways have been, reclusively and seclu- Bively si'Ciet. The doors are closed, and all cowans and eavesdroppers are kept away by stern sentinels. In the year 1829, and in the year 1860 the senate authorized the publication of the jour r.als of executive sessions, and they are interesting bits of history. In the executive journal of the first two ses sions of the senate there is nothing to Ehow where the senate was located; but the journal of the third session is care-fully headed: "A Record of the U. S. S., Assembled at Philadelphia, December 6, 1790." In the journal for Monday, Jan. 17, 1791, there is an In teresting letter received from the king of France and transmitted to the sen ate by the president. The letter is ad dressed "To our very dear friends and allies, the pre-sident and members of the general congress of the United gtates of North America," and says: "Very Dear Great Friends and Allies: We have received the letter by which you In form us of the new mark of confidence thai you have shown to Mr. Jefferson, and which puts a period to his appointment of minister plenipotentiary at our court," followed by complimonts tc- Jefferson and expressions of friendship for the United States. It Is datfd Paris, IKb September, 7190. and signed, "Your good friend and ally, Louis Jlontmor im." Once did Washington condescend to date a communication from Philadel phia, It was marked "Philadelphia, March 1, 1791," and it was addressed to the president of the senate, calling the senate together in the senate chamber in Philadelphia for the 4th of that month. The business of the special ses sion related to the nomination of Unit ed States officials to put the federal government into motion in the state of Vermont, which became a part of the Union on that day. The journals of the executive sessions of the senate are now kept by a gen tleman who bears no special title; ex cept that he Is a clerk in the office of the secretary of the senate. For a num ber of years there was an executive clerk, whose special duty it was to pre pare and preserve the journal of the executive proceedings, but that office has been abolished. The last Incum bent of the office was James Rankin Young, of Philadelphia, now an honor ed member of the house of representa tives. Mr. Young held that office for a. number of years, and his official rec ord Is most honorable and praise worthy. Executive secrets of national and international interest were con flded to him; and they were safer with him than they were with some sen ators. His Journals may not be pub lished for a generation; but they will be found to be In keeping with his character for painstaking attention to detail. It Is fair to presume that they ■Will be found to be more elaborate and possessive of more literary finish than «ny of the Journals of his predecessors, Hot one of whom obtained literary rep utation. The first publication of the executive Journals of the senate was in 1829, when the book was printed In Washington by jDuff Green, under a resolution passed by the senate on April i, 1828, as fol lows: Reeiolved, That the entire executive journal frf the senate, from the commencement of the federal government to the close of the last session of the senate, be printed and pub liahed. Resolved, That the said Journal be printed under the direction of the secretary of the •enato, who shall cause a suitable index to be mado and printed with each volume and that 700 copies be printed. Owing to the small number of copies printed the publication has never be come a common one, and at this late day a copy of it is rarely seen. There is a well-worn copy of it in the office of the secretary of the senate and it would be difficult to imagine anything more interesting in the way of political reading that a look through that Jour nal. The first executive communication re ceived by the senate bore the signature of Geo. Washington (as he always wrote himself down) and was delivered into the hands of the vice president by Gen. Knox, secretary of war. Its ob ject was to lay before the senate some treaties which had been made under the official superintendence of Gen. Knox with several tribes of Northern and Northwestern Indians. The mes sage began, "Gentleman of the Sen ate," and closed simply with the sig nature of "Geo. Washington," without any complimentary flourishes or quali fications whatever, and was dated New York, May 25, 1789," which was the in variable form of such documents. The second executive message was delivered June 8, 1789, by Mr. Jay, not secretary of state, but "Secretary of the United States for the Department of Foreign Affairs," who wrote himself down as hailing from the "Office of Foreign Affairs." It related to the con vention between his most Christian majesty (the king of France) and the United States, for the purpose of deter mining and fixing the functions and prerogatives of their respective consuls, agents and commissaries.

But in September, 1789, New York got too small for him, and thereafter he dated his communi cations not from New York, but from the "United States." His last execu tive communication from New York was dated Sept. 11, and his first from the "United States" was dated Sept. 16, 1789. The nomination Dec. 22, 1791, of Gov. Morris, of New York, to be minister of France; of Thomas Pinckney, of South Carolina, to be minister of London; and of William Short, of Virginia, to be minister to the Hague; led to the pro longed contest in the senate on a mo tion "that in the opinion of the senate it would not be for the interest of the United States to appoint ministers plen ipotentiary to reside permanently at foreign courts," but in the end the nominations were all confirmed. It would appear occasionally that Washington found it desirable "to turn the rascals out," for occasionally In their records of nominations is such a line as this: "John Armistead, to be surveyor of the port of Plymouth, in North Carolina, vice Thomas Davis Freeman, suspended " and in the army, "Cornelius Lyman, captain, vice Platt, cashiered." If the Father of His Country could not tell a lie he could make a mistake now and then, as wit ness his own confession in this letter: United States, Feb. 28, 1793— Gentlemen of the Senate: 1 was led by consideration of the qualifications of William Patterson, of New Jersey, to nominate him an associate justice of the supreme court of the United States. It has since occurred to me that he was a member of the senate when the law creating that office was passed, and that the time for which he was elected is not yet expired. I think it my duty, therefore, to declare that I deem the nomination to have been null by the Constitution. - Modern presidents constantly violate i the constitution and with impunity, j The organic law provides that the ■ president shall make certain appoint- j ments with "the advice and consent of the senate." The appointments still require the "consent" of the senate, j but it has been many a long day since j a president has respected the consti- : tution by requesting the "advice" of the senate. As a matter of fact, Pres ident Cleveland made many appoint- i ments and held his men in office, ! without the "consent" of the senate. As a well-known example, he appoint ed a colored man, named Matthews, to be recorder of deeds for the District j of Columbia when the senate was not j in session. When Matthews was re jected by the senate, he held the oliice just the same, until the senate ad journed, when Cleveland again ap pointed him. In the case of David G. Browne, who was made collector of customs for Montana, President Cleveland hold him in office for three years, although the senate declined to confirm his nomination. This was because one senator alone prevented action in the case. Nevertheless, it was not in ac cordance with the spirit of the con stitution, as it was understood by Washington. To prove this assertion, we may turn to the published executive journal and j ascertain that one of the first nomina- i tions which "Washington sent to the senate was that of a gentleman to take charge of the affairs of the United States at the court of France, during the absence from there of our minister, Mr. Jefferson, who had ap- | plied for permission to return home for a few months. In his message Washington said: "For this purpose I nominate William Short, Esq., and request your advice on the propriety of appointing him." A decision in the senate as to whether nominations should be voted upon by ballot or by viva voce was decided in favor of bal lot and on June 18, 1789, the seriate re solved to "advise and consent" to the appointment of Mr. Short, and the resolution was ordered to be trans mitted to Mr. Jay for communication. The Becetary to the president never goes to the senate now-a-days. On the contrary, for many years an ex ecutive clerk has delivered to the sen ate all messages from the White house. O. L. Pruden, who was pri vate secretary to President Hayes, fulfills that function. It is recorded that on Aug. 3, 1789, Mr. Lear, the president's private sec etary, first appeared as the president's messenger to the senate. He con veyed the nominations of a number of collectors, naval officers, and sur veyors; and as several applications for appointments had been addressed conjointly to the president and the senate, the president at the same time sent all such applications to the sen ate for their information. When these nominations were confirmed the action of the senate was communicated di rectly by the secretary of the senate to the president of the United States Instead of through the head of the department, as in the previous case of Mr. Short. The president of the United States never visits the senate chamber, al though It was contemplated by the constitution that he should do so. George Washington understood the constitution and was imbued with Its letter and spirit. The senate journal for Aug. 22, 1789, contains the following entry: "The president of the United States came Into the senate chamber attend ed by Gen. Knox, and laid before the senate the following state of facts, with the questions thereto annexed for their advice and consent." The state of facts related to the trou blesome Indian problem. On Monday, Aug. 22, 1789, the president was also present in the senate chamber, attend ed by Gen. Knox, of the war office, while the senate discussed and voted upon various questions Involved in the negotiations with the Indians. When President McKinley was Inau gurated he received the oath of office and delivered his address from the sen ate wing of the capitol, because the senate committee on rules decided that the inauguration of the president was an executive function. That was usur patory and violative of the spirit of the constitution, as it was understood by the founders of this republic. It is recorded in the executive jour nal of the senate that when the time came for John Adams to take the oath of office as president. It was done in the hall of the house of representatives in stead of the senate chamber, which had been employed by Washington. It Is noticeable that in enumerating the dignitaries present on the occasion of Adams' inauguration the official record alludes to "the great and good Wash ington." In Adams' inaugural address there Is one sentence which contains five times as many words as Washing ton's entire speech four years before, and, strange to say, that very sentence was devoted to telling his listeners that he would endeavor to follow the ex ample of Washington. Like Washington, Adams adopted the habit of dating his communications from the United States. His first ex ecutive communication to the senate, delivered by his secretary, Mr. Mal colm, said: "I nominate Joshua Sands, of New York, to be collector of the District of New York, vice John Lamb, dismissed." The word "dismissed" had never been used by Washington, but It was often used by Adams. In his second message he nominated John Quincy Adams, of Massachusetts, to be minister to Prussia. On the 4th of March, 1801, it is noted for the first time that the senate as sembled In their chamber in the city of Washington, which has been the seat of government ever since. Adams followed the example of Washington so well that just once he, too, wrote after his name the words, "President of the United States." That was in the com munication which he addressed to the senate calling the special meeting on March 4, 1801, to witness the inaugura tion of the new president. Jefferson's first message to the sen ate, communicated March, 5, 1801, the day after his inauguration is as fol lows: "Gentlemen of the Senate: The offices of secretary of state, secretary of war, at torney general of the United tSates, and min ister plenipotentiary to the Republic of France being vacant, I ncminate the following per sons to them: James Madison Jr, of Virginia to be sec- THE 

SAINT PACT, GLOBE: MONDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1837. retaxy of state; Henry Dearborn, ot Massa chusetts, to be secretary of war; Levi Lin coln, of Massachusetts, to be attorney gen eral, of the United States. ""Robert R. Livingston, of New York, to be minister plenipotentiary of the United States to the Republic erf France. As soon as these nominations were confirmed the senate adjourned to meet again in December. During the recess Jefferson completed an entirely new cabinet by appointing Albert Gallatin, Robert Smith and Gideon Granger to be, respectively, secretary of the treas ury secretary of navy and postmaster general. At that time there was only six departments, that of the Interior not yet having been organized. The members of Adams' cabinet are record ed by Jefferson as having resigned. But the members of Washing-ton's cab inet did not resign when John Adams in 1797 became the president, and no new cabinet officers were appointed. Washington's advisers were retained by Adams, but Jefferson selected his own. Although he never said it, in so many words, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to emphasize his belief in the doctrine that "to the victor belong the spoils." Before the conclusion of his term, President Adams sent to the senate the names of a num ber of men whom he desired to place in good offices. President elect Jefferson exerted his influence to prevent the confirmation of the favor ites of President Adams; and they were not confirmed. In his message Jan. 6, 1802, President Jefferson informs the senate of some commissions he had Issued during the recess, showing that twenty-three of the commissions were issued to fill va cancies caused by "removal," and twenty-seven were to take the places of gentlemen nominated by Adams in the last days of his term as president, but not confirmed by the senate. The form in which these nominations were communicated was like this: "George Maxwell, of New Jersey, at torney for district of New Jersey, vice Frederick Frelingftuysen, nominated March 2, but not appointed."Jefferson attributed to the senate the function of "appointment." The word now used is "confirmation." All the offices which Adams thus sought to fill with his own favorites were good, desirable offices, such as those of United States attorney, the United States marshal. In every case, without exception, Jefferson brushed aside the man named by Adams, and gave the commission to a man of his own selection. This may be termed "Jeffersonian simplicity," but it looked a little rank, even to admirers of Jefferson. He had nerve, detrmination of character; and he believed that friends of the admin istration should have preference. May be Jefferson would't have done a thing to the civil service law, this year, if it had left a lot of Cleveland men in tha best offices. — gmlth B. Fry.

J., Dec. 19.— The man ufacturing potters and their employes are still at odds over the matter of a scale of wages to go into effect on Christmas, the time when the manu facturers promised they would restore the 12% per cent cut made on the wages of the men some time ago. The men do not want a uniform 12% per cent raise of the wages they are now getting, but want modifications made to meet the changes that have been made in the matter of designs of certain lines of gec-ds and the changes in the demand for different goods. Several conferences have been held without result, and the men are threatening that unless a sat isfactory result is agreed to by the manufacturers by Friday, they will go on strike.

Sailors From the Ranger Rescued From a Barren Island. SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 19.— The four masted British ship Roby, Capt. Jones, arrived in port today 144 days from London. Capt. Jones reports that last Thursday morning, when off St. Nich olas island, he was hailed by a crew in distress. He hove to and sent off a life-boat to the distressed men, who were found to be five sailors and their captain of the sloop Ranger. The lat ter states that he was engaged in tak ing supplies from San Pedro to St. Nich olas, and that on the night of Dec. 9 the sloop dragged her anchor in a fearful storm and went on the rocks a total wreck, the crew escaping with their lives only. All the men had been without shelter for seven days and were suffering greatly for food and nourishment. They were taken on board by Capt. Jones and shown every attention. 0 ,|j J|k__ Sallle— l looked through the key hole last night when sister Mary and Mr. Staylate were in the parlor. Nellie— What did you find out? Bailie— The gas.

ONE GIRAFFE BREAKS HIS NECK. Animals Generally Stood tbe Voy age, Although; a Few Died on the Way. Barnum and Bailey's greatest show on earth, as it is called, is in a fair way to make as big a hit in London as did Buffalo Bill's wild West. Clar- j ence L. Dean writes that the show will j open its season at Olympia on Dec. 27 j (Boxing day), and work is being rapidly pushed on the building to get ready in ■ time. The preparations include the building of a complete fireproof wall and asbestos drop curtain between the audience and the stage, the opening of ; the proscenium being 365 feet long. This ! work has been undertaken to meet ob jections of the London county council to the biulding as it stood when rented by Barnum & Bailey, and as it had been for other exhibitions for the past eight or ten years. It will delay the j opening two weeks beyond the date j originally fixed upon, but will make the ; building one of the best in the world for exhibitions of this kind. The fact that Mr. Bailey immediately set about this work, and showed perfect willing ness to go to any expense to comply with the wishes of the county council, j has created a most favorable impres sion in London. Mr. Dean encloses a clipping from the London Daily Chroni- j cle of Nov. 25, which devoted over a column to the arrival of the show and the incidents of the voyage. This says: i It is betraying no secret of "LloyeVs ; to say that the life insurance premiums on giraffes, and particularly giraffes which travel, have become so high as to be practically prohibitive. The rea- | son lies upon the surface. Only <t I month or two ago the zoological gar- j dens had to mourn the loss of a male | giraffe which had been sent to the queen by King Khama as a jubilee present. He was, however, never fated ! to set foot on native British soil, for | he died from general debility, occa- ! sioned by a prolonged fit of sea-sick ness, Just as he was about to be taken out of his cage and presented to his i bride in the giraffe enclosure in Re gent's park. That bride, now a widow, some four and a half years of age, and fifteen feet in height, has risen In value since yesterday, according to the | inexorable laws of commerce, because | the decease of Daisy, one of the five i living giraffes in captivity, was an nounced yesterday on the arrival of the Massachusetts, which is bringing a portion of Barnum & Bailey's show into j the Thames. She broke her neck, and now there are four. This lamentable and expensive accident — for Daisy was valued at £1,000. and was the only giraffe ever exhibited in the states—oc curred when the vessel had left New York but two days. On these the Mas sachusetts encountered the only rougn weather of the twelve days' voyage. A sudden lurch, and Daisy was no more, having broken her "pretty neck," as the sorrowing keeper expressed it, in two places. She was buried at sea, af ter her skin had been removed. On the whole, however, there were very few casualties on the trip across the Atlantic. Three draught horses and two monkeys, a couchee-couhcee stal lion, the most elebrated performing horse in the collection. Eagle had had a long distinguished career, having been born in 1861. His earlier years were spent in Germany, but for a con siderable time he has supported the show with a vigor which be'.ied his age. Gravesend is a melancholy place at most times; yesterday it was positively appalling. A thick, dirty mist hung over the rfver, the river itself looked like a sewer in flood time, and the hoot of the syren as some boat was feeling her way up stream on the top of the tide set the general effect to fitting mu sic. A score e>r more of London jour nalists had come down at a depressing ly early hour to receive the Massachus etts, which was expected off Garvesend at 7 o'clock in the morning. It is my experience that the expected vessel at Gravesend generally happens to be at least half a dozen hours late, and so it was with the Masschusetts. Still there was a thick fog in the channel and at the mouth of the river, and as the boat had as valuable a cargo on board as can well be imagined — apart from bul lion or diamonds-r-the skipper was not prepared to take any risks. It was no mean feat, indeed, to bring her to an chorage off Gravesend by 2 o'clock, though by that time the fog had lifted a little. She stood rather high In the water, for lions and tigers and monkeys don't make the best kind of ballast, and having a good deal of top hamper in the shape of the wagons and other paraphernalia on deck she would prob- A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE. ably have rolled a good deal if the blessing of calm weather had not ac companied her during the greater part of the voyage. The upper decks pre sented an interesting scene as our tender neared the Massachusetts; most of the trainers, keepers, riders and so forth were massed on the starboard side of the vessel, about 250 in all, and they cheered us and we cheered them; the band on the bigger vessel struck up "Hail, Columbia," and thy waved little American flags and exchanged greetings with their friends on the ten der, who shouted facetious inquiries to them. And at length we got aboard. The steamer has been termed a "Noah's Ark," and that is a good enough de scription of her for advertisement pur poses. Probably no vessel has ever carried so many animals of so many different varieties before. She has on board thirty cages of wild animals, nineteen elephants, 240 working horses, 13G ring horses, twenty-six ponies, elev en camels and half a dozen zebras. The collection of elephants in the show is numerically strong, and in gross tonnage remarkable. Besides the nineteen on board the Massachu setts eleven more have booked their passages by another boat. The larg est of them on the steamer which ar rived yesterday were stewed in sta bles situated in the fore and aft main hatches. They have stood the voyage remarkably well, in fact that was the only thing possible, for there was not sufficient room for them to lie down, as is the habit of elephants when they want a nap. Only once has it been necessary to give any of them a, pick me-up in the shape of a two-gallon peg of rum; for the most part they have been steadily engaged in dimin ishing the 100 tons of hay which the vessel carried. Old Fritz is the doyen cf the elephantine staff. His fighting weight is 12,580 pounds, some 280 pounds more than the famous Jumbo turned the scale at. Fritz, however, is six inches shorter, though this doesn't seem to depress him as much as might be expected. He is a most gentle beast, according to his keeper, and a child might play with him. Now Mandarin, on the contrary, has a shocking temper, so that he had to be chained up. He has killed his man in his time, the precise time being dur ing the last visit of the show to Eng land in 1889-90. He attempted to get out of his box a night or two ago, and they had to use a donkey-engine, or some such contrivance to keep him back. Baby Ruth is an interesting in fant of two years, the youngest ele phant in the show, and has a storage capacity of about half a ton of hay a day. Close to the tigers' cage, in which four phosphorescent eyes were all that could be seen of the crown prince of beasts, was Jo hanna. She requires a little introduction, for she has not before made her bow to the Brit ish public. Whether she Is a gorilla or not | is a moot point, but she is certainly ' edu cated," which after all Is the principal point. She Is a precious animal, and lives pr-ncipa.ly i In a glass case. Standing four feet nine In j her stocking feet, she has been educated up , to the point of drinking a quart of o!d fruity port per diem. With this, a dozen eggs or ; so and an occasional cup of coffee and a cigarette, Into all of which vices her trainer. In other respects a quite blameless man. has Inducted her, she has cultivated the higher life sufficiently to sit at table and eat with knife, fork and spoon, though, if her diet be what her trainer says it Is, the latter articles would seem to be superfluous. Sunset Willie. so called because of the peculiar tint of his nose, is another gorilla, from Papua, where, according to the natural history books, goril'.as are decidedly Eearce. The tint of his nose is suppc-sed to be due to the fact that he had to put up with or put down, inferior port before he came into the possFssion of his present proprietors. The return journey, after one had interviewed Johanna as far as one can interview a lady in a glass case, was even more embarrassing then the previous one. First one had to run the gauntlet of the performing horses, which though comfortably stalled enough, touch each ethor's noses across the gangway. It may charitably be supposed that they were rather out of practice, and were anxious to make the most of It, but when a flea-bitten mare had taken your hat off, and an Ameri can thoroughbred rifled your handkerchief in an impossible attempt to find carrots, it was rather a relief to find yourself in the stable of the zebras, in spite of the fact that "they all bite," as the keeper casually informed y The Massachusetts, having missed the tide, was not docked until the early hours of this morning. Today the animals will be tak-n on Bhore but owing tff cou:ty c uncil r. gu a:t»ns they will not be able to pass through the streets to their temporary home at Olympla until after 6 o'ciock in the evening. 

PITTSBURG WANTS THE VETERANS. Half Million-Dollar Monnment to Be Unveiled In IJIOO. PITTSBURG, Pa., Dec. 19.— The in itial 9tep toward securing the G. A. R. encampment for Pittsburg in 1900 was taken last night by the Allegheny Coun ty G. A. R. association, and the plan will be agitated at the coming Cincin nati encampment. In connection with the encampment, if it should be held here, it is proposed to unveil a grand poldiers' monument to cost in the neighborhood of $500,000. The Pennsylvania legislature of 1895 parsed an act empowering each county to erect a suitable soldiers' monument at the expense of the cit'zens, thj neces sary amount to be raised by taxation. It is believed by the veterans here abouts that 1900 will be the last year for encampments. It is their ambition, therefore, to have the organization wind up its career in this city, and at the same time take part in the dedication of the proposed grand memorial to the nation's dead. * _ — c»~ Plate Glass Workers Go Back.

But this is a pleas ure as much as a task, and many of the old folk have as great fun in trim ming the tree and preparing to sur prise the children as the young ones themselves do in the completed tree and the gifts they find thereon. As for the tree itself, there are five different kinds, all beautiful in them selves — the pine, hemlock, spruce, ce dar and balsam fir. The prettiest of all and consequently the most expen sive is the cedar, covered with small, gray berries. The smallest of these trees cost 75 cents and the largest as high as $4. Ordinary trees of good shape and bright green color range according to size from 50 cents to $1. It is most convenient to have the tree placed at once in a holder, but the price of this may be saved by mounting the tree in a deep box well packed with earth. The tree must be | well braced, and the box must be as nearly square as possible. The box should be painted with green pnam I. The decoration of a tree, unlike the building of a h,ouse, begins at the top. Custom has made it almost Imperative that a figure of Santa Claus occupy this, the most conspicuous position. The figures sold in shops for this pur pose are made of either cardboard or plaster, and cost from 15 cents to 7T> cents. Except for very large trees the 35-cent size will answer admirably. The figure may be held in place with wire or strong black thread. Stock should now be taken of all the | articles which are to be used for dec orations. Tinsel plays an important part in this, for it gives a brightness and glitter obtainable from nothing else. Strings of popcorn are also use ful. Both whit*? and red popcorn may be procured already strung, or it may be bought in bulk very cheaply. With a needle and strong thread it is easily strung. Each string should be from three to four feet long. Granberrii s scattered at frequent Intervals along the strings add color to them. Strings of silver and gilt balls, ami balls of raw cotton, make pretty and effective decorations. Shreds of raw cotton may also be sprinkled over the tree. This does very nicely to repre sent snow. English walnuts, either natural or gilded, may be tied with ribbon and added to the other mate rials. You cannot have too much. Quantity rather thnn finality makes a tree beautiful. A dnzen or more dolls, made of bright colored tissue paper, should be added, if there are any fittle girls In the house. Candy canes and sugar animals of every conceivable kind are always appreciated by th • youngsters. "Little pasteboard boxes may \»- had at any drug store, and when touched up with ribbon make very pretty orna ments, l-nst of all. the candles, if it is intended that the tree be lighted. See that these are very securely fixed In their sockets, so that there can be no possibility of their falling. All these articles should be spread out around the tree before the work of decoration begins, so that a glance will show just what material there is to work with. Then commence at the top and festoon the popcorn and strings of glass balls in graceful loops, selecting the most prominent branch) s for fastenings, and covering up as much as possible any bare spots. The cotton balls, walnuts, candy boxes and figures come next. Tie the lighter ar ticles at the tips of the branches and the heavier farther in. The tinsel may represent icicles, ani the more thickly It is hung on branches and twigs the better. Last of all add the candles. Fasten the holders at the frrUs of branches. This prevents t£em slipping. Small presents may be placed on the tree and larger ones around its base. Th» tree must, of course, be set. be fore decorating, in the room in which it >« (<> remain i^'pfs it is a v v small tree, in which case it may be decorated in a room to which the chil dren seldom go. On Christmas morn- Ing it may be carried to the nursery while the little ones are enjoying their breakfast or exhibiting their toys in some other part of the house. In this way the sudden appearance of the tree will seem all the more wonderful. DOX'T GO TO CHINA. Consul Coddnow's Warning to Hnll r<»:n! Men. WASHINGTON, Dee. 19.-The first report to the state department from United States Con sul General Goodnow at Shanghai rontains a warning to American railroad men not to go to China for employment. Says he: "The American only Invites star vation who comes here without a definite con tract of employment with some reputable firm made before he leaver Araerira. I must ad vise United States railway employes that there is at present no mark?t for their labor in China, and should more roads ba constructed there will be a market only If these roads are built by Americans." The consul general says he has had many inqulries from American railroad men as to the chance for employment In China, so he de scribes the small Chinese railroad system to show the hopelessness of looking in that di rection for work. There are only two rail ways In operation with a total mileage o: mile?. They -employ only twenty-seven for eigners, of whom four are engineers, and the managers and division superintendents. The operatives are practically a:i Chinese, and a foreigner cannot compete with them. Th<> highest salaried natives are the telegraph op erators at $40 per month. Engineers get from $20 to $30 and train hands and trackmen $5 to $10 per month. All of this Is In Mexican ellver, worth 44 cents gold on the dollar. The roads are paying 15 pr-r cent dividend. Another road Is under eonstruet'on from Shanghai to Woo Sung— fourteen miles— and Chinese are doing all of the work, and on Dec. 18 the first sod was turned on th« projected road from Hankow to Peking, the completion of which depends upon the suc cess of the Belgian syndicate in floating Its loan. Mr. Goodnow recounts the ambitious schemes of Director Sheng, of the Imperial railway, to create a vast system of railways in central China, and encloses a map show [ Ing the projects. He says sheng's plan Is to build these roads aa money can be borrowed outside of China. lie proposes to couple with the railway loans a government loan of $80, --000.000 to pay the balance of the Japanese war indemnity. In this way the option of building tin- Chinese roads would be h»»hl out to the parties taking the government loan, and tha support of foreixn governments for the gov ernment loan would be Becun <1 by allowing the successful syndicate to furnish all the ma terial and skilled labor needed for the rail roads. Mr. Goodnow points out that under these conditions there will be no market for Amer ican railway material or labor unless Ameri cans furnish the money to build the railways. _4^_
