METCALF'S REPORT PRO-JAPANESE? Washington Officials Pro fess to Think Unions Caused School Rumpus QUEER DEDUCTIONS SPECIAX, DISPATCH TO THE CALL WASHINGTON, Dec 10. — President Roosevelt . will soon send to Congress a message transmitting- the report made to him by Metcalf, Secretary of Com merce and Labor, on his investigation of the exclusion of the Japanese from the public schools in San Francisco. ' This report will in some respects be sensational, because it will : show that complaints of the Japanese, while based on the alleged violation of treaty rights In the matter of equal treatment, were probably prompted by maltreatment; of Japanese residents of San Francisco^by riiembers of labor unions and other or ganizations who objected to their pres ence as workers on the~Paciflc Coast. Metcalfs report has been kept very quiet. There has been a demand from Congress for details of his investigation and all the facts Metcalf was able to obtain, except a few that It will be in judicious to publish, will be laid before the legislators. Some of these facts will not be to the liking of those who have been engaged in what an adminis tration ofScia.l today characterized as "an effort on the part of -the labor unions to drive the Japs from the coun try." Secretary Metcalf sent his account of his Investigation to the President to day. It will .be made public to show there was Justification for the message of the President, which criticised the action of certain people in California against the Japanese. It is said Secretary Metcalfs report •will show that some such emphatic treatment of the subject was necessary to bring the labor unions of California to a realizing sense of where their per secution of the Japanese was tending. According to a high official if some thing had not been done to check the incipient lawlessness there would have b»»en a repetition of the old Chinese riots when Derfnis Kearney held forth in the sand lots. The school matter was only an incident, it is said, and it is understood the report of Metcalf shows there would have been a serious anti-Japanese movement which would have interfered with the friendly rela tions between the United States and Japan or compelled the President to use force to protect the Japanese. The special cable in the Herald to day from Paris, showing how countries abroad are busily discussing the possi bility of war between the United States and Japan, was read with great interest here. The official view here Is that the discussion will do no harm now, and may do much good- in compelling Cali fornia to realize that the Japanese are not to be treated as the Chinese were a generation ago. Apropos of Kahn's bill for torpedo boats, the administration is rather pleased that members of Congress from California are waking up and it is not at all disposed to discourage discussion of possible war between this country and Japan. It believes ofiScial relations between the two countries. are now so good there is no possibility of a misun derstanding, and it has only to guard against the unexpected, which may ap pear In an anti-Japanese outbreak in San Francisco or from anti-American agitation In Japan. It is also felt that discussion will have a good effect in overcoming the tendency in Congress to pare down navy.and.army.appropri ations. ' ,\l, * ,\;: „*..;,". 

CVEXO SAYS LADrS MISTAKEN The public -will have to choose be : tween the veracity of a lady and a Japanese diplomat in forming its opin ion of the alleged boycott that has been Inaugurated against the Oriental Public School at Clay and Powell Etreets. /. The lady is Mrs. C. C Newhall. prin cipal of the school, who says that Con sul General Uyeno, organized the boy cott shortly after the Board of Educa tion had adopted resolutions providing for the segregation of Japanese. ' Uyeno himself "says he didn't do any Buch thing. Yesterday he was confined to bed with a cold at his home. 1730 Pine street, but his secretary, Ujlra Oyama, when seen at the Japanese Consulate said he was authorized to discuss the matter for his chief and impeach the veracity of the lady. "No representative of the Emperor of Japan will consent to be coached in international courtesy by a public school principal of San Francisco." de clared Oyama. "I don't wish to Inti mate that Mrs. Newhall purposely con veyed wrong information to the Board of Education, but I am convinced that she assumed too much when she re ported that Consul Uyeno organized a boycott against the Oriental school. : "What, let me ask, would be accom plished by such a boycott? It would have no effect on the protest lodged against the discrimination - shown* by the Board of Education against Japan ese and could not strengthen their, case in any way in the International,nego tiations now pending* on the /juestion. Consul Uyeno could not possibly ac complish, anything by boycotting this or any other public school while. the matter was being decided./ "He was - careful to observe /every convention surrounding his position as Consul General the day he visited. the school. He asked and obtained the permission of the principal before pro ceeding on his tour of .Inspection through the building, and she accom panied him in it throughout. "It 1b true that he spoke to a Jap anese pupiL This pupil, by the way, was the only Japanese then attending the school, and the Consul . General made no effort 'to coerce* him in ; any way. He simply talked , to , him as he might talk with any Japanese he would casually run across. Nothing was men tioned, about a boycott. -and no {effort was made to Induce the pupil to remain away from the school. As I remarked before, what could be accomplished; by such a boycott? — / / "60 far as I know, the matter /dis cussed by the Consul.General. and. the principal of the school related . to ac commodations. The Consul General re marked; that more students 1 would un-[ doubtedly; attend the school -than ;_was the' Case before the segregation;resolu tions ' adopted by ' the Board~of Educa-1 tion .went "into effect The}- principal agreed /with -him on this point* and ire marked' that the building /would ; prob ably be,. enlarged. That was. all there was: to their, lnterview.'* ".y \u25a0 ? ; .. . : .", Mrs. Newhall has reported differently, to the Board! of Education -and Secre-* tary" Metcalf. however, and until the matter Is officially adjusted it will have to remain In doubt', so 'far as: the public Is concerned.

They eloped : from Oakland,- and; Miss Cunningham was accused by. her mother, of having taken, valuable jewels, and 5400 worth of. fine clothing, belonging. to the latter, before the couple left.?. Miss Cunningham and Holly came . on the steamer Santa Rosa, and by request of the Oakland Chief of Police detectives were awaiting , them at Port Los ; An geles. The young people were recog nized at once, but,, to, make" sure, ,the officers took ' the next seat | behind"; them in the train coming to the" city and then arrested them. : : ;'*> \u0084 . ' - Holly/ who is of striking appearance, 1 lived with his mother in Oakland, and there met Miss Cunningham, .who. came from Detroit with her; mother to "re-" side. She claims ' her ; mother ' is es tranged from her father, Andrew; Cun ningham," a wealthy Detroit shoe polish manufacturer. Holly says he comes of a good New Orleans family, claiming Samuel A. Truf ant, -cashier of the Citi zens' National Bank, ; and /W.,W. Finley, vice president of the Southern Railway, as uncles. Hefdeclares Mrs. Cunning ham refused to consider him for a son in-law because she learned his race track vocation and deemed him inferior to her daughter. \u25a0 % Before Mrs. Cunningham was 'aware that her daughter had left home, the girl was in hiding in* San^Francisco with Holly, ready to start, and they left there Sunday morning. - They in tended being married the hour they ar rived in Los Angeles, tl.ey told the de tectives here, and seemed to take the whole affair as a joke when arrested. Seen in her cell at the City Jail to night. Miss Cunningham said: "Oh, this Is certainly humiliating. Certain ly I eloped with Mr. Holly. And I took my mother's jewelry, but it was not ex tremely valuable, I assure you. "" The clothing was mine. The only thingl de sire of the Los Angeles, police -is that they fix our bail. : It is outrageous to keep us locked up this way. I hays nothing to say regarding my mother's actions. She did not desire me to marry Mr. Holly, and I was determined. Yes, and I am still very decided about the affair." • \u25a0 •' . Holly seemed more concerned about the girl's welfare than his own. He spoke about as she did. It has been generally understood ; by Holly's friends that he is a married man and that his wife la in Japan. To night, however. Holly emphatically de nied . that he had a wife or was ever married. . . V'""-" ' \u25a0
