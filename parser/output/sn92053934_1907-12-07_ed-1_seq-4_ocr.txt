On the occasion of one of the largest and most representative gatherings of democrats ever assembled in nortncni ; Illinois, at Freeport yesterday, W. J. Bryan sounded the keynote of demo cratic success in the national cam paign to be waged next year. The great commoner spoke to three immense crowds, a banquet in the evening, at which COO sat down, being the culmin ating event of a day, in which the honors accorded Bryan were shared by J.. Hamilton Lewis of Chicago, candi date for the Illinois democratic guber natorial nomination. Tariff and currency reform, compul sory labor arbitration, and stringent regulation of the trusts were the is sues Mr. Bryan presented in his char acteristic forcible style. Such a meas ure of success as the party in power has enjoyed, and such popular policies and reforms as the present president has attempted to inaugurate, Mr. Bry an asserted with correctness and em phasis, involve the adoption and ap plication of democratic principles. The Nebraskan also spoke for har mony within the ranks of the demo cratic party, the wiping out of internal political differences, the putting away of personal grievances, and the union of all forces whose object is the ad vancement and enforcement of true democratic principles. It was a sound and logical position on the. part of the party's recognized jl 1 I . . 1 , . ,1 . . nf filnnlc who has grown in strength and popu lar favor and confidence during the 12 years that he has been before the peo- ' Ti-k 'it- a ti'Winnil phn nf tor $ le ?Irgus Daily Short Story "OneTight in the Car."-By Mabel Syms (Copyright, 1907. by P.

The 'drug stores in .Jacksonville are said to be doing a rushing business already. Can it be possible that our own Les lie M. Shaw has been lost in the shuffle?

The Chicago announces that reived the best Mr.' Bryan. Tribune rightfully ' Mr. Roosevelt re- his ideas from An Utile as Possible. The congress that has just assciu ! bled in Washington will have a great many important matters presented for its consideration, but probably will take definite action on. but few. It is the "time-honored" policy of the re publican party to do as little as pos sible at the session of congress imme diately preceding a presidential elec tion. This leaves so much less for the party to be criticised for. The repub lican party prefers a general mdict ment for sins of omission rather than a bill of particulars for sins of com mission. But the demands of the country may be so important that the G"th congress will have to overthrow precedent and actually do something. Stjwng efforts may be made, even within the ranks of the party itself, to bring about a revision of the tariff, but the advocates of tariff reform are not listeuing to the delusive whispers of hone and Ihev really expect nothing along this line. The republican lawmakers who as sembled in Washington this week win try and "mark time'' instead of re sponding to the desire of the people for a "forward march." Beatrice thrilled with excitement as the low buildings oii the river's edge came into sight. To lier the dlngy-Mi-tranc-e to the ferry house was the gate to the Hall of Rune.' She wished that Ben might be there to see the company start, but Itatsey, the ferret eyed little stage manager, had announced that none of the chorus girls might be accompanied to the train by friends or relatives under penalty t of a five dollar fine. He was nervously pacing the cobblestones in front of the entrance every minute to make certain that the rule would not be broken. On the block above the ferry house leave takings were plentiful, but the "house Itself was free of a crowd of weeping relatives nnd mournful "gen tlemen friends." ' ' "You are Miss Faber?" asked Ratsej In bis quick, tense tones as Beatrice came up. "You bunk with, Miss Stil liugs; berth 0, car 2. Better get right over and go to led before the train pulls out." "I thought I might be able to get a berth by myself," protested Beatrice "I am willing to pay the difference." "I have no time to make a chang?," said ItatsVy impatiently. "After the opening night you may, do as you please, but the management pays to the opening town, nnd you will kindly permit us to arrange matters. Miss Stilliiiffs has gone over already. You will timl her there." , The niggle, word "company'' passed Beatrice through the ferry gate anil on the. other side Into. the train shed..

When sheMiad graduated from the dramatic school she had expected to get a part with a Shakespearean com pany at least, but she had Iteen glad Twenty-four collpge graduates are street car conductors in Pittsburg. This shows that the educated man is sure of a job. Mr. Bryan approves of many parts of the president's message. This is bit natural when he had been giving him the suggestions right along. A vast number of the people of Bock Island are taking The Argus' advice in the matter of Christmas shopping. They are doing it now. The wedding of Mias Gladys Vauder bill, and Count Uv.eio Schechenyi has been postponed. Perhaps Miss Van- uerbilt can only put up cashiers checks. The Illinois legislature is giving the record-breaking exhibition of holding continual session without doing any thing, but that is characteristic of thii republican legislature. It 4s to be hoped that Santa Clans will make friends with some of those fellows who have been stuffing it in their bootlegs instead of depositing it in the banks. A jolly man like Santa ought to make a good borrower. The importance to a country of its inland waterways, including rivers and canals, is shown in the case of Ger many, with its total mileage of 1S,0K. in ieijt me Height carried on the unme alone totalled 5,500,000 tons and now 18,000,000. The watch trust has just declared a dividend of 175 per cent. This sounds Incredible, but it has boon clearly dem onstrated that under the present pro hibitive tariff American watches are sold abroad at a figure so low that the American dealer can well afford to buy them abroad, pay the shinpins charges both ways, and have them at a less figure than they are sold whole- Bale here to the trade. While lawyers are popularly suppos ed to be without heart or conscience, yet the attorneys of Burlington are seriously considering the proposition or refusing to appear In divorce cases. The leading attorneys of the city have practically agreed to refuse to take divorce cases of aif and all descrip tloj. , Many reputable lawyers will not ins"uVw; she had not rearriea'the ropes and had applied literally the rule that no relatives ruijrht see her off. There had lieeu no hand clasp at parting. and she had not even seen Ben. Her fastidious taste revolted at the Idea of spending the night in a nar row bertu WJtn a strange gin as a Iiedfellow, but there was no hope for it, and she entered the car. The special car was excessively hot and without sufficient ventilation. The aisles were packed with girls in va rious stages of undress and noisy with their chatter. xThe ear was entirely occupied by women, and the berth cur tains were regarded as superfluous, The stateroom door was partly open. showing three of the principals playing cards. The musty odor of Egyptian cigarettes came through the door and gradually mastered the other scents in the car. Two girls sat swinging their feet over the edge of upper 0, but the half of the lower lerth was occupied by a girl who-lay with her face to the window, her frail shoulder shaken by softs. "You draw lower G'i" grinned one of the occupants of the upper lerth "Bet you don't sleep. Stillings is home sick already. If she keeps up the yowling after the train starts we're going to have a pillow tight" "You'd better sit up in the smoking room,"- urged tinotber. "You don' want to get drowiied. and Stillings Is flooding the car with her tears." "I think it's a shame tp talk tha wav." declared Beatrice as she saw that the gibes were adding to their victim's discomfort. "You should bo ashamed of. yourselves." "One of them Salvation Army girls again this season," chanted the tor mentor from above, and the cry was caught up along the car until Beatrice Country Merchant) and tlie Parct;! Post. The Chicago Journal calls attention to the 'fact that 40,000 country mer chants are associate members of the Chicago Association of Commerce, and therefore it was to be expected hat the association iso dominated. would oppose Postmaster General Meyer's scheme for a parcel post. The country merchant sees clearly what a parcels post would do to him. He would be unable to compete with great- mail-order houses in the big cities when the government delivered their goods at almost no expense to them. Nothing then would be left for him but bankruptcy and ruin. Therefore the Association of Com iueice. wnich is an organization of merchants, city and country, has de clared itself against the postmaster general s project. The association has adopted resolutions to that effect, bas- ng the action on the facts that the pioposed parcels Post law would be class legislation, tending, toward so cialism; that it would cause discrim ination among different classes of citt zens and that there is no demand for it except among government officials. The postoffice department now Is run at a loss and taxpayers are un willing to add to the deficit by allow ing the department to act as a parcel delivery and express company for few city merchants, at the expense of a large and valuable section of the population of the entire state outside of Chicago. Postmaster General Meyer had bet ter drop the subject and devote his energies to managing the postal ser- vlce.which needs all his attention. B3dly Mixed Up. Auranam Brown of Winterton. N.
