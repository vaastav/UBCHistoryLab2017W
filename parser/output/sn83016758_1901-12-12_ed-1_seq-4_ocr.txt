THE PRINCETON UNION ByR. C. DUNN. PUBLISHED EVERY THURSDAY. TERMS, $1.00 Per Year in Advance. $1.25 If Not Paid in Advance. OFFICE- FIRST ST EAST OF COURT HOUSE. 0. I. STAPLES, Business Manager. GEO. F. WRIGHT, Editor. JOHN CHINAMAN must pay an indi vidual assessment of one dollar to fipht the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion act. John might as well keep his money. PROM the way the war department distributed that pri7e money for the sinking of Cervera's fleet, one would infer that there was considerable gross favoritism in that department, which is evidently controlled by a lot of con temptible officials who lack American spirit and fairness The rascals should be fired. Sampson gets $25,797.44 and Schley $149.53. Is that so? Well you ean-'t buy the applause of the American people for no $25,797.44, eh! HE State superintendent of public instruction has notified one of thethese school officials of Pierz, in Morrison county, that repeating the Lord's prayer in the public schools is in viola tion of Sec. 16, Article I, of the State Constitution, which decision was made by H. W. Childs, as attorney-general, in 1895. Minnesota school children must worship the text books and black boards and let it go at that. IN speaking of President Roosevelt's message, the London Spectator says there is the moral vigor of a Cromwell in President Roosevelt, and adds: "We are convinced that President Roosevelt is going to play a great part and a good part if he continues his work in therather spirit which inspires this remarkable sermon. He will prove the most sweet ening influence in the whole lump of American civil life that has been known for many years." HE 

UNION closes its twenty-fifth year of publication with this issue. It has passed the quarter post of the cen tury run and is now headed for the half. As this edition passes out of the UNION office into Uncle Sam's big sacks, and a few papers are filed away for future reference, the quarter cen tury's work is finished, there is but a moment's reflection, the types com mence to click again and life's story of io\e and hate, of woe and sadness and loy and gladness is told again MINNESTOA congressmen fared very \ell in committee appointments at the hands of Speaker Henderson. Fi\eof the seven members get chairmanships, i-ddy gets mines and mining, Fletcher expenditure on public grounds and ouildings, Heatwole printing, McCleary library committee, and Tawney expo sitions. Morris retains his place on ri\ers and harbors and is the Minneso ta member on the special committee having in charge the memorial services for President McKmley. 

CONGRESS is discussing a Philippine tariff, with a view to applying the Dingley law as against Philippine ex ports to this country and applying the Philippine commission's tariff sched ule to goods entering the Philippines A further section grants a rebate of customs tariffs on goods which have paid an internal revenue tax in this country There is no proviso in theresentative measure that it shall be temporary, so that the rates, if imposed, would be applicable until congress otherwise acted. Some members are of the opinion that it would be wise to dis ci iminate in favor of American goods in certain eases, as Germany and Great Britain are doing a larger busi ness in the Philippines than Uncle Sam is, but President Roosevelt and the cabinet are of the opinion that the United States must tote fair with all nations in our Pacific territory, and maintain an "open door" there. HE new canal bill has been intro duced in congress by Representative Hepburn of Iowa, who was the author of the bill passed at the last session. It differs from the Hepburn bill passed last year, in making the total appro priation $180,000,000 instead of $140,000,- 000. Of this total amount, $10,000,000 is made immediately available to be gin work, In some respects |he bill follows that of last year, authorizing the president to acquire a right of way from Costa Rica and Nicaragua and theu to direct the secretary of war to begin the construction from Grey town on the Caribbean sea to Brito on the Pacific ocean with suitable de fenses, etc. It begins to look as if the big ditch would become an assured thing. The Nicaraguan government has signed a treaty with the, United States leasing a section of Nicaraguan territory six miles wide which includes the route of the proposed canal, to the United States perpetually.

GERMAN TARIFF. Charlesn R. Flin indan article on the name of the federal government against any person or persons, or cor porations who in any way violate the provisions of the law. Another feature of the bill makes it compulsory on all parties summoned to testify in pro ceedings against any trustor monopoly and also in producing all books, papers contracts, agreements and documents to give $10,000,000 for the establish ment of a national university in the city of Washington, provided the gov andsciftntififlfiftvftlnnmfink TU the university. The Smithsonian Insti tute was made possible by Mr. James $1,000,000 for the purpose of establish ing an institute at Washington for the purpose of the diffusion of scientific knowledge.

Mr. Flint thinks that in the present state of the world's development that the enactment of any additional pro tective or prohibitive tariff is distinc tively a retroactive step. "Nations of the first class that ex pect to progress and grow must stead ily enact laws looking to a free trade than a more .restricted one," says Mr. Flint. "In our own case I am not in favor of the enactment of anyof provision that will inter/ere with vested interests, but if we must have tariff legislation at all, let us have it in the direction of lower rates rather than higher ones. I do not think the time has come when we should mater ially scale down our duties, such as they are, but when we do have tariff legislation it should be in the line of such scaling down, so that we should encourage freer intercourse with the other nations of the earth."' 

CONGRESSMAN LITTLEFIELD of Maine, has started in to carry out President Roosevelt's suggestions in regard to controlling the "'community of inter- est1' enterprises that are making so many radical changes in our industrial and commercial life. According to the terms of his bill on or before Septem ber 3 of each year, the corporations in question are to file a return, stating date of organization and constituent companies the amount of authorized capital stock, with the amount issued, outstanding and paid in: total indebt edness, giving nature of the same and the purpose for which it was incurred: statement of assets and liabilities, in cluding mortgages, total earnings and income, operating expenses, salaries of officials and wages of employes. Swear ing to false returns shall be deemed perjury and the offender punished by the laws of the federal government. An annual tax of one per cent, on thecircuit capital stock issued and outstanding is to be imposed where corporations are engaged in interstate commerce.
