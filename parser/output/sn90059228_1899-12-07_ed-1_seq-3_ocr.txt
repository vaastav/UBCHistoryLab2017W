Washington, Dec. 2.Considerable interest is felt here in the news that the insurgents at Bayombong have surrendered, particularly as the num ber is said to exceed that captured by the United States troops at any one time. Bayombong is the city to which Agninaldo at one time contemplated retreating for the purpose of locating the rebel capital, after he was forced to flee from Tarlac, but the American troops pressed him so hard that he was unable to carry out his intention.

INTERNAL REVENUE. IT.xtraets from, the Report of Com mission er Wilson Estimated Jf Revenn es for Next Year. i Washington, Nov. 29. Commissioner George W. Wilson, of the Internal revenue bureau, in his report to the secretary of the treasury of the operations of his of fice for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, shows that the receipts from all sources aggregated $273,484,573, an increase over the preceding year of $102,617,000 and an in crease of $3,484,573 over the estimate of the commissioner made one year ago. The re ceipts from the several sources of revenue during the last fiscal year, and. the in crease or decrease in each as compared with the year 1898, are given as follows: Spirits, $99,283,534 increase, $6,736,534. To bacco. $52,493,207 increase, $16,262,685. Fer mented liquors, .$68,644,558 increase, $29,- 129,137. Oleomargarine, $1,956,618 increase, $640,838. Filled cheese, $18,098 increase, $1,579. Mixed flour, $7,840 (law not in force last year). Special taxes not elsewhere enumerated $4,921,593 (law in force only small part of last year). Legacies and dis tributive shares of personal property, $1,235,435 stamp taxes under schedule A of the war revenue act, $38,618,081 me dicinal proprietary articles and prepara tions required to be stamped under sched ule of the act, $3,219,737. The collections by districts during the year where the amount collected is over $8,000,000 are given as follows: Illinois, $47,- 359,523 New York, $46,634,980 Pennsyl vania, $23,335,573 Kentucky, $22,215,234 Ohio, $21,341,065 Indiana, $17,213,070 Mis souri, 16,369,075 Wisconsin, $9,467,065 Mas sachusetts, $8,152,620 Maryland, Delaware, District of Columbia and two counties in Virginia, $8,130,409 New Jersey, $8,074,261. The total amount expended in the col lection of revenues during the last fiscal year was $4,591,754, or 1.68 per cent, of the collections. This percentage of cost is the smallest that has ever been reached in the history of the bureau. For the fiscal year 1898 the cost was 2.29 per cent, of the collections. The estimated expenses for the next fiscal year are $4,877,340, a slight increase over the last year. In addition to the statement of the re ceipts for the last fiscal year figures are presented showing that the receipts for the first four months of the current year amounted to $103,103,485, an increase over the receipts for the corresponding period last year of $9,378,307. While it may be pos sible, the commissioner says, that this large ratio of increase will he maintained during the current year, he is of opinion that it will not be wise to anticipate such a result. All things considered, the com missioner estimates that the receipts from all sources for the present year will ap proximate $285,000,000, which is about $11,- 500,000 in excess of the receipts for the year closed June 30. 1899. &> (,V w_ j^ Griggs, Cooper & Cou's wholesale gro cery' store," at Third and Wacouta streets, .St. Paul, was damaged by fire, the dam age on stock and building probably Teaching $150,000.

During the fiscal year ended June 30,1899, the public lands disposed of aggregated 9,182,142.16 acres. The total cash receipts during the year amounted to $3,070,137.34, an increase of $792,142.16.

VICTORY DEARLY BOUGHT.^ vgy"?" Britisli Loan 'at Buttle Graa of Nearly 200Gen. Met linen Womide Battle Pan London ~Nov. 29.A dispatch has been1 received here from Gen. Buller giving a list of the casualties among the troops engaged in what was hitherto known here as the battle of Gras Pan, but which is now officially designated the battle of Enslin. I proves, as an ticipated, that the British success was heavily bought. The losses announced Tuesday, added to the naval brigade casualties previously notified, make a grand total of 198 as the cost of Gen. Methuen's second battle. The York shires, apparently, bore with the naval brigade the brunt of the fighting, as there were, in addition to three' of the officers, 48 of the rank and file killed, wounded and missing. The fact that the list contains the casualties of the Ninth lancers seems to dispose- of the fears that the cavalry was surrounded and captured especially as none of the Lancers are reported missing. N ew York, Dec. 1.A dispatch to the World from London says: The casual ty list of the Modder river fight is awaited with the keenest anxiety. A rumor is current that the English losses, Including both the killed and wounded, probably were 500. Distress ing scenes were witnessed about the war office, where relatives of the offi cers and men engaged in the battle waited in agonizing suspense for news. It is understood that the war office re ceived the first rough estimate of the casualties at six p. m., but refused to give out any information. London, Dec. 1.It is officially an nounced that Gen.Methuen was among those wounded at the battle of Modder river. Gen. Methuen, it developed later, was slightly wounded' by a bullet which inflicted a flesh wound in the thigh. 'z $*- Insane Patient Murdered. Kankakee, 111., Dec. 2.

Moore, Chief of This fv#..-.y,iw." .Valuable Service. ^SJ^jN^" Washington, Dec. 1.The annual report of Prof. Willis L. Moore, chief of United States weather bureau, deals largely with the work of the bureau in announcing the tempestuous weather of the closing months of 1898, and in the exploration of the upper air by means of kites and clouds observa tions. No destructive marine storm occurred without the danger warnings of the bu reau preceding the storm. Probably the most severe storm within the memory of the living swept along the Massachusetts coast on November 26-27, 1898, entailing a loss of at least 200 lives and many vessels. Hundreds of craft sought a safe anchorage on the advice of the weather bureau. Climate and crop services have been es tablished in both Cuba and Porto Rico, and the organization is far enough advanced on both islands to issue weekly and monthly bulletins giving the condition of the crops as affected by the weather.

ROOT GIVES BIS IDEAS Many Sua-n-estions Are Made by tb Secretary of War In Hts An nual Report. Washington, Dec. 2.The annual report of Elihu Root, secretary of war, was made public Friday. The first half is devoted to the operation of the army In the Philip pines, Cuba and Porto Rico. The report gives a full history of the military opera tions in the Philippines from August 12, 1898, up to the present time. An impor tant feature of the'report is the comprehen sive outline of a plan of government for Porto Rico. It is understood that Pres ident McKinley is in entire accord with Sec retary Root on this question, and that the plan outlined by the secretary will be the identical plan which the" president will rec ommend to congress, in his annual message. Concerning the plan of government pro posed ,for Porto Rico, Secretary Root cites the Paris treaty, which provides that con gress shall determine the civil rights' and political status of the natives of the terri tory ceded to this government. The scheme outlined includes a definite declaration by congress of what American laws are to be made applicable to the Porto Ricans, fol lowing which it is recommended that a federal judiciary he established. The report cites in brief the history of the military operations in the Philippines, Porto Rico and Cuba during the fiscal year ended June 30,,1899. Relief work in all three places Is dilated upon. The transport serv ice, it is stated, includes 51 steam trans ports, with a saving in work done over or dinary commercial rates of $501,000. The re moval of the dead from Cuba and similar work contemplated from the Philippines is touched upon. An increased and reorganized regular army, with many new and novel features in the system involved, is earnestly recom mende. Radical changes, which contem plate the betterment of the service in every department, are proposed. The ehinge in the army organization and the increase proposed are in the first instance specified particularly, while in the second no definite statement is made except as to artillery. The present artillery force is recommended to be increased five times its present strength. The increase in officers and enlisted men is to be sufficient to man the equipment in the seacoast fortifica tions, besides providing for the other branches of the service. The secretary recommends- the enlarge ment of West Point military academy and an increase' in the number of cadets to be admitted annually. Especial attention is to be paid to the artillery branch of the service in that institution and in the army. A ranking officer of artillery is recommend ed, there being no such officer now. The regular army now numbers 61,999 en listed men and 2,248 officers, making a total of 64,247, and a volunteer force numbering 30,050 enlisted men and 1,524 officers, making a total of 34,574. The deaths from all causes, including casualties in action, for the 14 months from May, 1S98, to June, 1899, in clusive, were 6,619. The deaths from disease from all causes were at an annual death rate of but 25.68 per thousand. Estimates of the cost of maintenance for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, are as follows: Civil establishment $1,967,706 Support of the army and military academy 87,015,290 Fortifications and river and harr bor improvemnts 30,499,576 Miscellaneous 5,196,799 A liet deficiency appropriation of $16,000,- 000 is asked for. The secretary declares in favor of a cable from the United States to the Philippines, via Hawaii and Guam. Among his other recommendations is one that Gen. Shafter be retired, with the full rank of major general. The continuance of the river and harbor Improvement work now under contract, it is announced, will cost $15,436,626.68. A monument to Gen. Grant, to be erected In Washington, is also recommended, as is a memorial bridge extending from the cap ital city to Arlington, where the national cemetery is located. It is also recommend ed that $65,000 be appropriated for purchase of the ground for a battlefield park covered by the battleground of Fredericksburg, Salem Church, Chancellorsville, the Wil derness and Spottsylvania Court-House.

New York, Nov. 29.After an unin terrupted career of 82 years the great publishing house' of Harper & Brothers is compelled to acknowledge that it is unable to meet its maturing obliga tions. Bravely, and with a spirit which will meet with approval in business circles the world over, the members of the corporation, seeing the stress in which the Franklin Square house is placed, decline the proffer of further loans from the banking house of J. Pierpont Morgan & Co. Upon the sug gestion of Harper & Brothers, and with the consent of its principal creditor, J.

HEAVY Tiro Fires in Philadelphia Causirir Total Destruction of Property^ Worth Nearly 2,000,000.' Philadelphia, Nov. 30.Nearly $2,000,- 000 worth of property was destroyed by two fires in the heart of the business section-of the city Wednesday. The greater of the two fires started in the big department store of Partridge & Bichardson, at the southeast corner of Eighth and Filbert streets, the very center of the shopping district, at 6:30 a. m., and before the flames had been put under control they spread to ad joining property and caused a loss of about $1,000,000. While this fire was in progress and spreading every moment another fire broke out four blocks away on the fourth floor of 'No. 419 Market street. The loss of this fire is estimated at $110,000. The losses of the two fires are more than covered by insurance. 'a# The Eighth street fire started in the basement of Partridge & Bichardson's store from an electric spark, and soon the entire building was amass of flames. The two stores to the south of Partridge & Bichardson's were soon gutted, and then the flames attacked the big-build ing of the J. B. Lippincott Publishing company, on Filbert street, east of the burning department store. This pub lishing house is one of the best known in the country, many high-class refer* ence books, periodicals and numerous other publications being produced by the firm. The building was completely ruined. Iiit Bros.' large department store, which adjoins the Lippincott building, and which is valued with its contents at more than $1,000,000, was saved, but only after the contents of one corner of the building had been damaged. Straw bridge & Clothier, another large depart ment store on the west side of Eighth street, also had a narrow escape and tha building and contents were damaged TO the extent of about $50,000. A number of other business houses, adjoining Lippincott's and Partridge & Richard son's, were either entirely destroyed or badly damaged. The second fire was discovered at 7:30 o'clock in the four-story buildinjr at No. 419 Market street, occupied by several manufacturers and wholesale dealers. The entire building was gutted, as was also the adjoining building, No. 417. The estimated loss is $110,000. More than 2,000 persons were thrown out of employment by the fires, but pro prietors of other department stores offer temporary employment to all of Partridge & Bichardson's 900 employes at the salaries they received from the burned out firm. Mr,.- v:., REVIEW OF TRADE. November Somewhat Quieter Than the Preceding monthPrice Situ ation Generally Strong New York, Dec. 2.Bradstreet's says: "Warm weather and a holiday, have im parted an appearance of irregularity and even dullness" to some lines of distributive trade, completing a month which has been on the whole quieter than was the pre ceding month, but one which still makes, satisfactory comparison with a correspond ing period a year ago, when the weather conditions particularly favored distrib utive business in seasonable goods. Th* price situation generally is apparently one of notable strength in view of these con ditions. Farm products, it is true, notably wheat and corn, have been weak and lower on unsatisfactory foreign demand, and a bearish influence exercised by in creasing supplies of the former grain. Other cereals are stronger, however. Pro visions have been lower, largely on in creased receipts of hogs, but lard has been, steady on good export demand. Iron and steel are even quieter than they were a week ago, and some shading of prices* more in the nature of readjustment, how ever, than of weakness, have given an ap pearance of irregularity. The feature of the week has been the agreement upon iron ore prices, placing the price for the com ing: season, as was intimated in this column last -week, at nearly double that paid at the opening: of the present season. The in dustrial situation has been rather im proved by the practical agreement upon a sliding scale system in the New England cotton manufacturing districts. Some fur ther advances in wages of railway em ployes and of glass workers are to be noted, and some strikes of coal miners* have been settled." -v Seek Heavy Damages Detroit, Mich., Nov. 29.Announce- ment is made that libel suits amount ing to $450,000 are about to be begun against the Detroit Free Press by Gov, Pingree and several others. Gov. Pin gree claims $250,000, Assistant Cor poration Counsel C. D. Joslyn, $100,000, and Assistant Counsel Eli R. Sutton, $100,000. Speaking editorially, the Free Press says that until the complainants have recited their grievances in court, which they have not done as yet, de tailed reply is impossible, but that in all matters in which they have opposed these individuals, the opposition has been for what the Free Press considered the public weal. Personalities were employed no farther than was thought necessary to attain a righteous end. "Will Reduce Rates. New York, Nov. 30.The Western.
