CUBAN CONVENTION Has Before i Three Constitutions to be Considered, By Associated Press. ' Havana, Dec. 4. Tho Cuban Consti tutional Convention was sitting today. Threo complete constitutions wore sub mitted by General nivora, Senor Ques ada and tho colored General Morna, re spectively. Delegates will discuss them later. General Rivera proposed a constitu tion that provides for a President, Senate and House of Representatives, a governor for each of tho six: prov inces, a legislative body for each prov ince and one member 'of the House of Representatives for every 30,000 In habitants, with the election by popular vote. His schemo also calles for threo electors In each municipal district, whose duty It shall be to olect a legis lative body of eleven for the provneo in -which they reside. This legislative body shall olect a governor and four members of tho Senate. Finally tho six legislators shall meet and choose a President, who mu3t be a native Cu ban. General Rivera's Idea Is to have all power vested In the central govern ment, and the convention virtually pledged Itself to one state government at tho yesterday session.

General Morua offered for tho ap proval of the convention the constitu tion of the United States, with tho ex ception that any one who has fought In war might bo chosen President.
