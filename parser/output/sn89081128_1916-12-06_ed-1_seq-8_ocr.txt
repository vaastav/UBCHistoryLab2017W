A Declares That Their Opera tion Should Not Be Stopped or Interrupted by the Con certed Action of Organized Bodies of Men Until a Pub lic Investigation Shall Have Been Instituted. I* N one of the shortest messages ever sent to congress President Wilson urges that early action be taken to complete hi*? pio gram of "settlement and regulation" recommended at the last session The message in full is as follows Gentlemen of the Congress In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the constitution of communicating to you from time JO time information of the state of the Union and recommending to your con slderation such legislative measures as may be judged necessary and expedi eat I shall continue the practice, which I'hope has been acceptable to you of tearing to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs •f the public senice and confine mv •elf to those matteis of moie geneial public policy with which it seems nee e*sary and feasible to deal at the pies eat session of the congiess I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at tills session and shall make my sng gestions as few as possible But theie Were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public to do at once The Railroad Problem. In the first place, it seems to me im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideiation and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settlement and regulation which I had occasion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the public dan fen disclosed by the unaccommodated difficulties which then existed and Which still unhappily continue to ex ist between the tailioads of the coun try, and their locomotive engineeis, conductors and trainmen I then recommended* First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In the, bill recentlv passed by the house of representath es and now awaiting action by the senate in ouler that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various du ties now devolving upon it with a promptness and thoroughness which •re, with its present constitution and means of action, piaetically impossible Second, the establishment of an eight hour .day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages in the employment of all railway employees who are ac tually engaged in the work of operat ing trains In interstate transportation Third, the authorization of the- ap pointment by the president of a small bodj of men to obseive the actual re sult* Jn experience of the adoption of the eight hour day In railway transpor ts$ssi alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the in terstate commerce commission of an Increase of freight lates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by the adoption of the eight hour day and which have not been off Mt by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed Justify the increase Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to It a provision that, in case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public Investigation of*~the merits of every •ueh dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted Control by the Executive. And, sixth, the lodgment in the hands of the executive of the power, In cast of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railways of the coun try a may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft Into the military service of the United State* such train crews and adminis trative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use The second and third of these rec -emmendations the congress immediate ly -acted on: It established the eight hottr day as the legal basis of woik •ad wages in train service and it au thorised the appointment of a commis sion to observe and report upon the ^practical results, deeming these the measures most immediately needed, but It postponed action upon the other sug jattkmi until an opportunity ghould be offered for a more delibeiate consider ation of them. The fourth recommendation I do not deem it necessary to renew The pow- r~~ W&c sLd't N33MI 

OPERATION OF RAILWAYS SHALL NOT BE STOPPED To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual work man to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society in doing so would be to adopt a new principle into our jurispru dence which I tako it for grant ed we are not prepared to intro duce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not bo stopped or interrupted by the concerted ac tion of organized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at is sue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any sueh prineiple. It ie based upon the vry different I principle thai the concerted ao tion of powerful bodies of men shall not be permHted to stop the industrial processes of the na tion. fc er of the Interstate commerce commis sion to grant an increase of rates on the ground referred to is indisputably clear, and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the commission's authority or its inclination to do justice when there is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions—the increase in the interstate commerce commis sion's membership and hi- its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate* the rail ways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity—I »ow very earnestly renew. New Legislation Necessary* The necessity for such legismtion is manifest and pressing. Those who hare intrusted us with the* responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them in such matters would find it hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action. Not only does the interstate com merce commission now find it practical ly impossible, with its present member ship and organization,, to perform its great functions promptly and thorough ly, but it is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heawy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative instrument. The country cannot and should7not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbi tration and conciliatlon^whkjh the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make Immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues Its own case in the mere statement of It. With regard to one of its items, the increase in the ^efficiency of the interstate commerce commission, the house of representatives! has al ready acted. Its action needs* only the concurrence of the senate. To Safeguard Industrial Processes. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupa tion should be obliged by Jaw to con tinue in an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or pre vented the individual workman to leave his work before receiving the approval of society in doing so would be to adopt a new principle into our juris* prudence which I take it for granted we are not prepared to introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by the concert ed action of organized bodies of men ttntil a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the concerted action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial pro cesses of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportu nity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between employee and employer, time to form Its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to consider all practl I cable means of conciliation or arbitra tion. I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbitrary or unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupulous re gard for the interests and liberties of all concerned as well as for the per manent interests of society itself. Three matters of capital importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives—the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged t» pre iu«toiMaaiipMff^ Urges the Passage of the Corrupt Practices Act Reg ulating the Expenditure of Money In Elections and Fa vors More Freedom of Com bination to Those Engaged In Foreign Commerce. motlng the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the law's against monopoly, the bill amend ing the present organic law of Porto Rico and the bill proposing a more thorough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, commonly called the corrupt practices act. I need not labor my advice thai these measures be enacted into law Their urgency lies In the manifest cir cumstances which render their adop tion at this time not only opportune but necessary. Even delay would se riously jeopard the interests of the country and of the government Immediate passage of the bill to reg ulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less neces sary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer, because at least two years will elapse before another election in which fed eral offices are to be filled, but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pies ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience And a delay would have the further serious disadvantage of postponing action un til another election was at hand and some special object connected with It might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and ^without suspicion of partisan purpose Enlarging Our Export Trade. I shall not argue at length the de sirability of giving a freer hand in the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume, 

REGULATE EXPENDITURE .OF ELECTION MONEY Immediate passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less necessary than the imme diate enactment of the other measures to which I refer, be cause at least two years will elapse before another election in which federal offioos are to be filled, but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the present method of obtaining and spend ing csmpaign funds stand clear under recent observation *nd the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience. has indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessary instrumen talitles for its prosecution. It is deem ed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an-adequate scale un der our present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesl tate or delay. The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Portp Rico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not Just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily remove. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular We oujrht to do it at once. Legislative Annals Enriched. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it is not necessary that I should speak Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say With what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you In the many measures of constructive policy with which 'you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor in such company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare servkeablenesg and distinction. *~-"ir 

SITUATION VERY CRITICAL DAJ Roumanian Capital and Armies De- fending It Continue Under Serious Menace From Trdops of Central Pow- ers Advancing Prom Three Sides, London, Dec. 5.—The Russian war office announces that the Teutonic forces have occupied the village of Gradichtea, south of Bucharest. Ob stinate fighting is proceeding between Alexandria and Bucharest. The situation in Roumania, still the chtef center of military interest, does not appear markedly less critical for the Roumanians, despite the reported success of the Russo-Roumanlan of fensive southwest gt Bucharest in holding back, temporarily at leasjt, Field Marshal von Maekeaft#n/s iA yadiag forces. Bucharest and the armies defend ing it continue under serious threat mt only from the forces on the south west, hut also from those along the line ©f the Argechu, stretching north westward to Piteshti, and from Gen eral von Falkenhayn's armies pressing southward from the mountain passes. Advancing From Three Sides. The force of the converging .at tack thus being pressed from three sides of Bucharest does not appear to have diminished, but the resisting powers of the Roumanians, reinforced by Russian troops, seem to have strengthened somewhat. On their successes in preventing further important breaks in the de fensive line apparently depends not only the safety of Bucharest, but of the main Roumanian armies engaged with in the angle of the Teutonic thrust. The Serbians have renewed their successful advance in Macedonia, cap turing a height north of Orunishte and driving the Bulgarians in the di rection of Stravina, four miles to the northeast, according to the French war office statement Desperate battles have been in progress for several days in this re gion, which lies beyond the Cerna river, east of Monastlr. BELGIANS REVOLT AND HUNDREDS ARE SLAIN London, Dec. 5.—Two Belgians who have arrived at Sluiskill, Holland, from Ghent report that there was a revolt in Antwerp Nov. 30 in which between 200 and 300 inhabitants and many German soldiers are said to have been killed, according to a Reuter Amsterdam dispatch, quoting a Sluis kill correspondent. The reported re volt was due to a call on the inhabi tants for work in Germany. RIOTING AT ATHENS CEASES City Calm After Recent Anti-Ally Demonstration. Athens, Dec 5.-—The city is calm After the rioting and anti-ally demon stration allied troops are in control. Six batteries of field artillery will be delivered to the allies as soon as a protocol is drafted between the gov ernment and Admiral Fournet. Normal relations have been re-es tablished between the allies' com mander and the Greek government. By turning over the batteries Greece complies with the allies' last demand, despite the statement in the premier's appeal to America Saturday that Greece would not yield further. FRENCH TRANSPORT IS SUNK Berlin Reports Deetruetion of Six Thousand-Ton Vessel. Berlin, Dec. 5.—The sinking by a German submarine of a 6,000-ton French transport filled with troops was announced by the admiralty.

RUSSIAN PREMIER HOOTED IN DUMA Petrograd, Dec. 5. —When Premier Trepoff mounted the tribune in the duma to read a government proclama tion members of the Socialist and La bor parties began such a hostile dem onstration that the premier was un able to speak for a quarter of an hour. Three times M. Trepoff appeared on the tribune, but each time the turmoil forced him to leave. Finally the president of the duma procured the adoption of a proposal that twelve members of the two par ties, including their leaders, be ex pelled for eight sittings. This demonstration is taken to mean that final settlement of the dispute be tween the government and represen tatives of the people, relieved tempo rarily by a partial change in the min istry, still is far distant.

DEFENDS WAR|C0NSCRIPTI0N North Dakota Senator Would Draft "Less Commendable." Washington, Dec. 5 —Conscription in time of war is absolutely necessary, in the opinion of Senator McCum ber of North Dakota "Whether we should make military training universal will depend a great deal upon what the result of the pres ent war may be," he said. "•There is one thing, however which I think we should insist upon,'if not upon military training. That is con scription in event of war. Volunteer service means the slaughter of the most patriotic, the bravest and best, leaving the less commendable to popu late the world." ATTEMPTS TO SEE PRESIDENT Stranger Tries to "Deliver Letter" to Wilson at New York. New York, Dec. 5—A man giving the name of Jacob Acks, aged twenty, who said he was an Austrian by birth, but had lived in this country for eighteen years, was arrested at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel when he tried to make his way into the banquet hall where President Wilson was dining.
