Dear Sir: I was agent for the sale of your An tidote forMalaria at Elizabethtown, Ky., when chills were almost uni versal every season. The medi cine cured when all else failed. It was my habit to say that I could live in a frog pond without danger to myself, but that conceit has been taken out of me, for last fall I had a violent attack of chills. I re membered the Antidote, procured a bottle, and was cured immedi ately. I now say to every one suffering from Malaria, don't fool with quinine; it may be good, but Shnllenberger's is belter, and doVt make you deaf, either. Your friend, E. If, IIavcraft. Liberty. Time honored town, place of pleasing and delightful memories, cherished be thy name! Long hast thou held a high place in the affec tions of the people of the good old cwmty of Amite, whose business center for near a century has been here. In this town the courts of judicature have passed upon the rights of persons and property of four generations of men, who have appeared upon the theatre of ac- tisn and most of them passed away, but have left behiud them others who took their places in the drama. The foot-lights are still burning, the curtain is up, and the play still goes on. When we consider the many events that have trans pired affecting the progress of busi ness in this old settled town, and contemplate the effect that despair aging remarks from the drones of each generation have had, as they have traveled down the years to the present time, we can but won der that the town has bcon able to live to see the afternoon of the nineteenth century with vitality enough to attract the attention of business men, and to offer induce ments to the artizan, the merchant and the professional man who cast their lot with her people Yet we rejoice to see that the outlook is brightening, and that in spite of the restless and dissatisfied croak ers, who can only find time to com plain ot what others arc doing, that business is improving, enterprise is meeting with more encourage ment and crowned with better suc cess than has been the case for many years. To men of business and families of children to be edu cated, we can offer good facilities for the prosecution of their callings and the education of their children. A high school has been established in the town, under the conduct of an educated and experienced teach er, who is the head of a family, and expects to make this a permanent home, and if he receives the pat-' ronage he deserves, will in the near future build up a college in which the children and youth of the country may be qualified for the higher walks of life, and at the same time have the benefit of parental influence and home train ing, thus shielding them from the danger of contracting habits of dis sipation, so common to students while at colleges far away from their homes. We are pleased to learn that a number of families are makingarrangements to avail them selves of our business and educa tional advantages, and expect to move to our town soon, and we would here suggest to parties who own property abont town that is now unoccupied and in a dilapidat ed condition, to go to work at once and improve their places, and make them lcnantablc for families, as there is now and will be still more demand for houses suitable for residences. There are several saw mills around not far from town, where lumber can be had at reasonable prices, for making the suggested improvements, and we we do hope to see repairs on old buildings, and new ones put up as the incoming families may need them. Ye habitual grumblers, for get your complaints, and repair your houses before they fall upon your heads or got beyond repair; and if vou will not repair vour own houses, do not by your pic tures of gloom prevent others with more sunshine around them from improving their property. Liberty is and ever has been a safe place for well conducted business, and ever will be while the county seat is here, and. owing to the central position of our town in tho county, that may be regarded as a perpep uity. This, like all other towns, is and will continue to be just what the people make it. If every one will do all that they can to foster our school, encourage our home business men, and persist in this self-sustaining effort, we will ere the ides of November next sec a wide awake town, thronged with a busy people, hear the sound of the hammer in many directions, and see the sign of the painters brush all around, yards and gar dens neatly fenced, and homes again be emblematic of the refine ment, prosperity and happiness of our people. The Star says the wages of the sewing women of New York, and there are many thousands of them, average from $2 to $4 a week.

The Macon Sun states that Miss Willie Mays, of Shuqulak, who re ceived the second highest number of votes at the Macon Fair as the prettiest young lady in Noxubee county, eloped with a gentleman from Washington City, and was married to him in Mobile last week A statement prepared at the Treasury Department shows that during November there was a net increase of $2,360,967 in circulation and a not increase of $8,871,746 in cash in the treasury. The total circulation Dec. 1 was $1,368,873, 016, total cash in the treasury $617, 371,748. The revenues of the government from all sources during the month of November amounted to about $30,500,000, beine an averace of little more than one million dollars a day. The disbursements during the month were unusually heavy and nearly equalled the receipts Over $18,000,000 was paid out on account of pensions. The Redemptorist fathers of the province of Baltimore have had prepared for presentation to th Pope, on the occasion of his golden jubilee,a combination writing desk and bookcase.

Our Washington Letter. Washington, Dec. 3, 1887. The Democratic Congressional Caucus, which will assemble at the Capitol the last of this week, will settle the fate of a number of as piring gentlemen who are ambi tious to serve their country as sub ordinates of the House of Repre sentatives. It is the opinion of many that the Hon. Sunset Cox is to be both temporary and perma nent chairman of the Democratic Caucus. Since I last wrote you, the situation has changed somewhat all the candidates for Doorkeeper having withdrawn except two, Don aldson and Hurt, a contestant for the Clerkship having appeared in the person of W. G. Raines, of Rochester, N. Y.,and it is said that he is supported by powerful influ ences. On the other hand, the friends of the present Clerk, Gen. Jno. B. Clark, of Missouri, confi dently claim his re-election. Greater interest is felt in politi cal circles in Washington as to what may transpire at the other end of the Capitol next Monday, as the seats of at least two of the twenty- six Senators who will present them selves to be 6worn in on that day, are to be contested one each from California and West Virginia, lo say nothing of a protest from Indiana the situation being complicated by the fact that of the fifty Sena tors holding over, twenty-five are Democrats and twenty-five are Re publicans Riddlcberger included. Thus the Senator from Virginia holds the balance of power. I am informed that it is the policy of the Democrats to forestall the contests by urging the seating of all the new Senators at once in a body, and in case the Republicans refuse as sent to the proposition, to produce a legislative dead-lock. The ad mission of the Senators from Cal ifornia and West Virginia involves the right of the State legislature to choose a United States Senator at an extra session; thus the decision in these cases will be useful as a precedent to settle future contests of this character. There is every indication that the Senate will wage a vigorous war against the President this winter the provocation being Mr. Clcav land's appointment of the Ameri can Fisheries Commissions, who rank diplomatically as special en voys, without the "advice and con sent of the Senate." The question of prerogative thus raised is quite an old one, dating back early in the history of the Government, and it affords political demagogues a ready subject of interminable contro versy. The International Fisheries commission is now in secret ses sion at the State Department, and consequently the deliberations of this dignified body are not known to the public. The argument in the Standard Oil discrimination cases, much to the surprise of nearly everybody, has been postponed by the Inter state Commission till January 16th . From all your correspondent can learn of the evidence, it seems that a rather strong case has been made out against the Jumbo of monopo lies, if Jay Gould's telegraph lines be excepted. Chief Justice Waite, of the Su preme Court, celebrated his seventy-first birthday this week, but he does not look a day over sixty years. One year ago the venerable jurist was eligible to retirement, and he could then have resigned his commission and demanded a salary of $10,000 per annum the remainder of his life. The same may be said of Associate Justices Field, Miller, and Bradley. Per haps in no other country of the world can be witnessed four sep tuagenarians vigorously working every day, when they could re ceive precisely the same compen sation for doing nothing whatever. According to the annual report of the First Assistant Postmaster Gen eral, the number of postoffices in the United States on June 30, 1887, was 55,157; it further shows the still more gratifying fact that over 25,000 Democrats have been ap pointed postmasters during the past two years. It is surprising to think of the vast amount of money lost in trans mission through the mails. The report of the dead letter office shows that the sum of $29,687 was found in letters, of which amount $22,639 was returned to the send ers. There was deposited in the Treasury $6,672, taken from dead letters that could not be restored to the owners, also. $2,921, the pro ceeds of auction sales of packages of merchandise, which could not be restored. The President's Message. Times-Democrat: The message gent yesterday by the President to Congress is unique. It is, first of all, the shortest Presidential mes sage ever sent, and it is confined wholly to a single subject the tariff. The President declares that the reports oi the various depart ments will show their condition, and, therefore, it is unnecessary for him to recapitulate them again; and he, therefore, devotes himself to the consideration of the tariff as the question of the most vital and immediate importance. It is a matter, he asserts, the considera tion of which Congress cannot post pone without great danger to all our interests, without risk of a financial crisis brought about by tying up too much of the people's money in the Federal Treasury. It is something of a tribute to this country, its great and increas ing wealth, its natural resources, and the economical administration of its affairs, that the great ques tion to be considered by the people is how to reduce the revenue and get rid of the surplus in the treasu ry. It does not need, however, the strong presentation made by Mr. Cleveland to show us the evils likely to follow from overtaxation and from the rapidly accumulating surplus. Some relief has hitherto been obtained in the purchase of bonds, but this is no longer possi ble, save by paying extortionate rates for the redemption of securi ties that do not fall due for years to come. And now as to the President's views on the tariff. They are put strongly, emphatically and uneqiv- ocally. The President declares himself, in no uncertain terms, a revenue reformer and opposed to protection, pure and simple. He would have Congress leave the in ternal revenue alone, and concen trate itself in the work of reducing the tariff; he would have the free list greatly enlarged, the duties cut down principally on articles of ne cessity. Mr. Cleavland argues these questions and points out why he recommends changes. The "in dustrial," as the manufacturing classes of the population are some times called, constitute he says, but a Bmall proportion of the work ing population, yet all are taxed and burdened to support them; the duties prevent our competition abroad with other countries, and otherwise injure instead of benefit ing the country. It must be admitted that the President presents these views forcibly and strongly. It cannot be doubted, after the manner in which his views are pressed upon Congress, that the tariffwill become the chief matter of legislation this winter, and that a tariff bill of some kind or other will be passed. It will rest with Congress to frame one that will accomplish the great est good to the country, with the least injury to our industries. We do not agree with the President in regard to the non-reduction of the tobacco tax. It is true that tobacco is not a necessity, but the tax is troublesome and burdensome to the agricultural producer, and the cost of its collection is consid erable. In regard to the tariff du ties, the President himself recom mends, in accordance with the plank of the Democratic platform on this subject, that the reductions be made so as to entail the least injury to the laborers engaged in our several factories, and to allow the capitalists a fair share of profit, at the same time that no encour agement, aid or support be given to "trusts" and monopolies. Such a programme, if faithfully carried out, would reduce the reve nues with the leaBt injury to our manufacturing industries. It is possible, but in view of local, po litical and other prejudices it is difficult, and it will require great statesmanship and wisdom to ac complish this result. Natural gas displaced in the year 1886 no less than 6,358,000 tons of coal valued at $9,847,150, a fact which goes far to explain the com paratively small increase in pro duction of coal contrasted with the far greater increase in the produc tion of iron. In every community there are a number of men whose whole time is not occupied, such as teacher's, ministers, farmers' sons, and others. To these classes especial ly we would Bay, if you wish fo make several hundred dollars dur ing the next few months, write at once to B. F. Johnson & Co., of Richmond., Va., and they will show you how to do it. It Will Not Fail. THE
