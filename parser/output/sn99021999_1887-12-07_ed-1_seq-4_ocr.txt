They have hitherto boon higher than in any other section of the country , and complaints from tlio traveling public have bcon numerous and vigorous of late. COMPTKOLUiii Tronholm has re ceived over forty pinna from financiers of all parts of the country , .respecting . anew now basis for national bank circulation , but not ono of thorn is sutllciontly free from objections to bo adopted. This is a very curious circumstance in a country in which nine men out of every ten know just how the national llnanccs should bo managed. THK people of No Man's Land , which lies between Kansas and tlio Texas Pan handle , will this winter make an at tempt to have their country organized into a territory. Tlio region is not very largo , being only ono hundred and 'sixty-seven miles by thirty-seven , but would rank very well with Rhodn 'Island ' or Delaware in respect to flize. A Kansas congressman will lay the matter before congress. SOMK of the state papers have been reducing their surplus recently in ad vocating the removal of the state capi tal. Inasmuch as there is no possible way to move it at the present time , it appears that the question is entirely out of order. There may como a time when it will bo serving the interests of the people of Nebraska to locate the capital - tal elsewhere. But the time is not yet ripe.

THE president's message has finally bcon delivered , Mr. Cleveland recog nized the truth of the expression thai brevity is the soul of wit , and condensed it to 7,000 words.

The third annual message of Preside - de | t Cleveland marks a notable do- pnrUiro in tlio character of thc ! < u com munications to congress in the fact that it Is devoted wholly to the onenubject of revenue reduction. The president could have chosen no more forcible way to emphasize to the country and to congress his profound conviction of the paramount Importance of this subject , and ho lias treated it with a clearness and earnestness of statement which are evidence of the careful study ho has given to the question and thu deep con cern ho feels in it. lie has left no room for a doubt respecting the attitude of the administration regarding what should bo dune to relieve the people of unticccs.-ary taxation and reduce the revenue of the government to the necessary expenses of its economical operation. Without outlining , on h6 was expected to do , n measure of tariff revision , the president .very . plainly indicates tlio character of the measure which ho thinks necessary to meet the requirements of the exi gency. Tlio message reviews the financial condition of the country since the ad journment of the last con gross and the operations of the treasury that wore re quired to relieve monetary distress and avert a more serious state of affairs believed to be threatened. All the au thority and expedient ! ) within executive' control for affording financial relief having been exhausted , the responsibil ity of preventing further trouble is now devolved upon congress. Tlio several methods that have been suggested for disposing of the surplus are briefly con sidered , and none of them receives unqualified approval. As between the policies of buying bonds and refunding them at a lower rate of interest , the president indicates a preference for the former. lie does not see it to be certain that refunding would result in moro financial benefit to the government than buying bonds , and the latter course would reduce the debt instead of extend ing it. With regard to the deposit of money by the treasury in banks through out the country , which has been done tea a moderate extent as a measure of re lief , the president thinks it to bo objec tionable as creating too close a relation ship between the operations of the gov ernment and the business of the coun try , and too extensive a co-mingling of their money , thus fostering an unnatural reliance in private business upon public funds. The view of the president is that the treasury should be as far as possible divorced from private enterpriseand he condemns the policy of granting power to a single individual to bo used at his discretion to withhold from or release to the business of the people money held in the treasury , thus.at his will affect ing the financial situation of the coun try. The president is averse to ex travagant expenditures for avoiding the accumulation of an excess of revenue. Such a policy would bo demoralizing to just conceptions of public duty and would encourage a reckless improvi dence not consistent with the mission of our people or the high and benefi cent purposes of the government. With regard to revenue reduction the president clearly believes that it should , come wholly from the tariff. He regards the taxes derived from tobacco and liquors as giving no just cause of com plaint to consumers and working no hardship to any portion of the people. In urging the reduction of tariff duties the president sayo it is not proposed to en tirely relieve the country of this tax ation. It must be extensively continued as the source of the government income , and in a readjustment of the tariff tlio interests of American labor , as well as the preservation of our manufacturing industries , are to bo considered. But the protection to be given manufac turers should not mean a condition which , without regard to the public welfare or a national exigency , must always insure a realization of immense profits instead of moderately profitable returns. The claims of labor to a full share of regard and advantage are not to bo lost sight of , but of moro than seventeen millions of our population , according to the last census , engaged in all kinds of industries , less than three millions were employed in the indus tries claimed to bo benofltted by the tariff. With no disposition to deprive this minority of an advantage , the presi dent argues that being consumers with the rest they would derive equal benefit from such wise reduction of the tariff as need not diminish the demand for their labor nor reduce their compensation. Special reference is made to the duties on wool and woolen manufactures to show that the farmer gets in the end no advantage from the .alleged protec tion on his wool , since he must pay out the whole amount gained as tariff profit , or more , in the clothing nnd other manufactures of wool which ho must buy. In the formation of com binations to reduce competition and to maintain the prices of commodities at the tariff point the president sees a proof that some are willing to accept lower prices , and that such prices are remunerative , evidence which he thinks worthy of consideration in an effort to reduce taxation. The president concludes his careful and straightforward presentation of this subject by pointing out that both parties are solemnly pledged to the people to reduce taxation , and urging that tlio question "imperatively presented for solution should bo approached in u spirit higher than parti sanship. " The message commends ib-olf to the attention of the country as a clear , Mraichtforward , patriotic and statesmanlike discussion of the ques tion which ovwslmdows all others in its immediate importance , and is cer tain to exert a great influence upon the public mind. 1 Tlio Treasury lleport. The rcport'of Secretary Fairchild is n clear and comprehensive statement of the operations of the national treasury for the last fiscal year , with es timates of receipts and expenditures foi the present and. the next fiscal years , Much of the statistical information it contains has been anticipated. The surplus taxation 'during the l < u > t fiscal joai-viw a fraction over VlO 

OOO.OOO and during' the present fiscal year ll will amount to $ Il,000,000. : ! Regarding the question of what shall be done with this surplus revenue , the secretary says , that both bond 'buying , except for sinking fund ptirjxteos and governmental expenditure in ex cess of the needs of the government should bo rejected , and urges thnt reduction of the revenue from taxation is the only fit remedy for the uvils which threaten the country. In considering the methods of reduction proposed ho takes positive ground against oitheraboHshlngor reducing in ternal revenue taxation , holding that the articles upon which excise taxes are collected whisky , beer and tobacco "are in very small measure necessary to the health or happiness of mankind. " In an equally positive way the secretary assorts that reduction of revenue should be made from customs taxation alone. Ho says : "Add to the free list as many articles as possible. Reduce duties upon every dutiable article to the lowest point possible ; but in ascertain ing these possibilities the pres ent situation of labor and business must always bo kept in mind. " The secre tary offers ojily a brief argument in sup port of liis position , it evidently being understood that the elaborate discussion of the subject was to bo left to the pres ident , whoso message covers the ground very thoroughly. Regarding 'tho sur plus , the secretary advises that a portion tion of it bo allowed to lie in banks , "where it would bo available for the business of the country , and , as upon withdrawal from them it would be at once returned to tlio channels of busi ness through government payments , no shocks would be caused by such with drawal. " An interesting part of the re port is devoted to customs ad ministration , of which the secretary - rotary says the difficulties in the col lection of duties pointed out by his pre decessor still exist. He states that the number of customs suits resulting from the defects of the system lias grown so large that there is no reasonable pros pect of disposing of them in this gen eration. The laws enacted ostensibly to prevent fraud by undervaluation pro mote rather than suppress that evil. Numerous remedies for the diflicultics are suggested , perhaps the most impor tant of which is a change from ad val orem to specific duties. The secretary says that "theoretically considered , ad valorem are preferable to specific duties ; nit in practice , under such ratcs _ as we uivo had and must continue to have for ears to come , tlio former are the'too easy source of deception and inequality it the custom house. " Regarding the foreign commerce of .ho country the report directs attention. : o the disagreeable fact that this corn- nerce carried in the vessels of the LTiiited States , measured by its value , ; ias steadily declined from 75 per cent in 18-30 to less than 14 per cent in 1887and , von of this small per contago less than one-half was carried in steam vessels soaring our flag. The sccretar.ydis- misses this rather important subject with little moro than the very--Instruc tive figures , but with this observation : It is ditlicult to understand why it would not 1)0 well to so change our nav igation laws as to allow foreign built ships owned by our citizens to come and go between this and other countries while bearing the ( lug of the country of their owners. " On the subject of the currency the re port states that the circulation of coin and paper increased from July 1,18SG , to November 1 , 1887 , to the amount of $10tUOO,000. ) The secretary thinks it is waste to coin and store any moro silver dollars at present , as there is no func tion which those that are coined after this time will probably over perform except to he in government vaults and bo a basis upon which silver certificates can bo issued. Ho recommends that the law bo amended so as to authorize the secretary of the treasury to issue certifi cates against the coining value of the bullion bought and to coin only such number of dollars as ho might deem expedient hereafter. Suggestions of safeguards against the depreciation of the silver dollar merit the careful at tention of congress. The report of Secretary Fail-child is a practical , business-like presentation of the numerous affairs administered through the treasury department , and is valuable rather as a compilation of facts with only necessary explanatory comment than as a treatise on financial and economic questions. A "Colony" Fraud. The BKK receives from Portland , Ore. , information to the effect that the Puget Sound Co-operative Colony is an extravagant swindle. Tlio Omjonhtn , the leading newspaper of Portland , de votes considerable of its editorial space in a recent issue exposing the methods by which one Smith is duping the people ple who are allured by his false state ments concerning the co-operative col ony. Inasmuch as the same Smith has hold meetings in Nebraska and urged honest and decent people to move to the Port Angeles community , wo deem it proper to caution all persons to thor oughly investigate before accepting his dizzy scheme , The paper in question says that not withstanding the misrepresentations of the leaders of the now idea , there are not to-day over two hundred and fifty residents in Port Angeles , and they will suffer for the necessaries of life this winter. The chief evangelist of the colony fraud assesses all who join a cer tain sum , and in this way ho manages to mnko a reasonably good salary , and can afford to indulge in his shameless and baseless misrepresentations. Many honebt farmers , merchants and poor citizens in Iowa and Illinois are re ported to have joined the colony , paid their assessments and finally ascer taining the lads , of course refused to go. The Orcyonian says : "Last August a number of its victims whoso eyes had been opened stated without reservation to many poi > ons .they mot on their re turn to the east that the whole scheme was so Impudent and so extravagant that the only reason why they did not print a detailed s.tufcment of its utter baselessness as a l/usinesa enter prise was the natural roluctauco of the liunuin pigeon to admit how badly ho had been plucked. " > II 'Is further claimed that the colony did not raise sufficient farm produce for their winter supply , but had spent the summer months building n largo hall for a society of "ethical culture. " All In all , unless our iniCM'inntlon comes from a very prejudiced iniiitl , V.'hlcli Is not probable , Mr. Smith and his so called co-operative colony are both ! lr l-wnlci' frauds. Men with families and of limit ed means can ill-afford to bo humbugged by these mountebanks who prey upon the credulous by cjttortlng the charms and advantages of a section of country which offers ncItuV'r .recompense nor happiness to those who unfortunately locate there. As a general proposition it is always a good business principle to turn a deaf car to traveling strangers who offer glorious things for a small compensation , and wo believe it espe cially true in this instance. Doing Its Duty. Tlio sago left in charge of our ancient Douglas street contemporary , says that it takes "something besides the absence of Mr. Rosownter from the city to stop the dirty work of his paper. " Dirty work , indeed ! Was it dirty work to expose a fraud ? Was it dirty work to tell the taxpayers how Mr. O'Kceffo saved the county many dollars by check ing Cadet Taylor in his attempt to cap ture tlio county commissioners and their printing at rates extravagant and ex cessive ? Was it dirty work to relate the circumstance of liow Cadet Taylor used his paper in nn attempt to levy blackmail upon a candidate for regent of tlio state university ? And it might bo remarked that the absence of Cadet Taylor from the city and his paper , leaves no ono in his edi torial chair who is so sublime in impu dence that ho will attempt to defend Taylor's efforts at corruption and job bery. The Omaha BKK will bo found in the future as in the pant , contend ing for honesty and decency in all things. And when plunderers attempt to rob tax-payers and individuals , it is the unyielding policy of this paper to expose them , whether its editor is in town or out of town. IT is announced that Senator Pad dock wants to head the next republican delegation to the national convention. There are many Nebraska statesmen who yearn for this distinctive honor. AM , the Chicago nnd Omaha lines , following the Burlington , will put on fast trains by the first of tlus new year. Omaha is getting there with botli feet. 

FRAUDS IN The McthodH Used by < ] ) calcrs to De ceive Tliolr Customer * , There is no article used Hvhich figures as prominently us flour , yet , notwithstanding , few families know auytiiui | ? concerning its value. People are hi ithOjhabit of buying from their grocer , un THlre whatever brand is sold them without rtijyio&ialderation what ever. This is a greift mistake , as a very small proportion of the flour sold in Omaha is disposed of over the name of the manu facturer , and dealers resort to many little tricks in order to uiulro consumers believe that they are gutting well-known mill brands. There arefor , Instancs , over twenty brands of Hour known ns Superlative on this market , and nineteen of them are counterfeit. There is but one mill which manufactures the gen uine article , nnd dealers use tlio name for the purpose of deceiving the public and selling' a cheaper grade at an advance in price. A fav orite trick with some jobbers is the mixing cheap grades with higher ones ; one-third of inferior Hour with two-thirds of best grades , which in reality iimkes a fair article of bread , but does not contain the nutrition which should charac terize the genuine article. Some Jobbers have machines made esj > ecinlly for this mix ing process. For thia reason the very best grades of Hour are riot us a rule handled by Omaha flour men. Consumers would do well to refrain from purchasing flour that does not bear the brand of the manufactur ers , as this would lesson in a great decree the practice above mentioned. Situated us Omuha is with regard to being able to get the grades necessary to making a first-class grade of flour , it is absolutely imperative that it should have good flouring mills in or der to avoid this imposition. The major portion tion of the inhabitants depend upon the bakers'for their bread , who use an inferior grade of flour , they as a rule being unable to purchase first-class flour in cnr lots , and being nt the mercy of the flour jobbers , who works off his mixed articles upon them. Flour is being jobbed In this city at a profit of from r > 0 cents to $1 per barrel , and the re tailer sells it at another profit , and ns stated , it is of very inferior quality. If housekeepers would , or could , rather , purchase tlrst-class flour the difference In the bread produced would bo very noticeable ami instead of being eaten as is the case at present , merely to fill up , there would bo a little genuine pleasure at meal timo. A thoroughly posted flour dealer stated yesterday that the highest priced Horn- is the cheapest in the end for the reason that it produces from 20 to 40 per cent more bread than the cheaper grades. Prof. William Jags of England innilo a re port to the crown last year on the wheat anil Hour supply of the United Kingdom which was afterward issued for the use of millers , brokers and merchants. It stuted that upon fifty tests from homo and foreign grades , the surplus analyzed contained in crndp gluten. which is the mitritous substance from 18 to 43 per cent , with ono exception , that of a well-known Minnesota mill , which contains 48 IHMcent. . This last brand is very nearly standard. There are several first-class brands of Hour on the market , nnd they nro in reality the best to purchase , anil if parties would give stricter attention to this ono matter alone the results could not fail to bo appreciated , not only from the fact that better results would be obtained as regards the quality o bread , but from a sanitary standpoint.

The City Council. There was a good turnout or councllmen nt the meeting last night , nnd the lobby was crowded with an expectant audience. Tlio usual buttonholing and whispering was ex tensively Indulged In , and did not cease until the gavel of President Hechcl fell. The following communications were re ceived from the mayor : Approving ordi nances passed at lust meeting appointing K. M. Stcnberg , .f. H. Lacy and L. Utiggun , uppralserrt.for the opening and widening of Twenty-seventh street from Grunt to Paxton street ; notices from William Anderson und MM. P.

When reports from the board of public works were read , Councilman Ford uroso and said ho would not vote favorable on anything from that body that was not signed by at least two of the members. Huscall also gave Chairman Hal- combo n dig. Several grading estimates were received from the board and approved. A communication containing thu opinion of City Attorney Webster on the city hall con tract was referred to the Judiciary commit tee.

The city physician reported S7 deaths and 119 births In Omaha during the month of No vember. The November report of the police judge was referred. The communication from thu board of fire and police commissioners asking for addi tional policemen was read and referred to a special committee. Councilman Leo said that ho had learned through the newspapers that this communi cation had been sent to the council sometime ago. Councilman Hascall defended the council by asserting that thu newspapers had misrepresented them , nnd indulged in a wild hurunguo which fulled to draw applause from the lobby. A petition of the Chicago , St. Paul , Minne apolis & Omuhu railroad for permission to construct a sewer along Grace street was referred. The water works company reported the locating of nind lire hydrants in different parts of the city. J. Gross and Ad. Janetschko asked permission to use the lire hydrant nt the corner of Howard and Fourteenth streets for flooding a skating rink. Referred to the chief of the tire department. Henry W. Pottlt , on motion of Councilman Leo , was allowed $30 for making necessary repairs on the smallpox hospital. A communication from the hackincn of Omaha asking the council to afford them rights which they claimed to be deprived of WHS referred to the committee on Judiciary. G. A.

OMAHA , Dec. 7. To the Honorable City Council : I would respectfully report that at u meeting of the board of public works to-day I moved that the resolution passed November 17 , 1SS7 , by this board , cancelling the con tract of Regan Brothers for the construction of the city hall basement , be reconsidered. " This was seconded by Mr. Hchnrod nnd car ried. I wish to call the attention of the city council to the fact that the said resolution is still before the board of public works and has not been acted upon nnd therefore said contract is not yet cancelled as has been re ported. Respectfully , C. E. MATXK , Member Board of Public Works. A petition from property 'holders on Will iam street , between Eleventh and Thirteenth streets , protesting against the introduction of the sewer system along saidstreet , was re ferred to the city engineer. A communication from the fire and police commission asking for additional horses for the police patrol wagon , was referred to the committee on appropriations. The meat insj > cetor reported having con demned . ' 1,045 pounds of meat and fish during the month of November. The street commissioner was directed to tour down and remove the arch at the inter section of Sixteenth nnd Furnam streets , and John F. LIsy was given permission to erect a s'gn ' In front of his premises , No. 18'U South Thirteenth street. Permission was given to the Cable Tramway company to put in a tempoary wooden curb in front of their power house on Twentieth and Harney streets. The following resolutions wore adopted : Relaying the crosswalks or > Park nvenuo at the crossing of Poppleton , Pacific , Mason and Lcuvenworth streets and across Leaven- worth street at the intersection of Park nvenuo ; compelling contractors to taku care of and replace sidewalks torn up for grading ; to clean Thirteenth street between Mason and Hickory streets ; that the street com- niissioncr bu instructed to repair sidewalks in various parts of the city ; compelling ueo- plo living on Nawton street to arrange fences to conform with tlio proper lines ; ordering the city clerk to advertise for several pieces of land for park purposes , nonu of which shall bo less than ten or moro than 2,000 acres ; directing the board of public works to advertise for thirty days for bids for all kinds of paving ; locution of lumps in front of the church at Eleventh and Center streets and Jewish synagogue ; employ ing a fireman to run the furnaces in the city building. Councilman Kicrstead offered the following : Whereas , Thu city attorney has sustained Chairman Balcombo in his action annulling the contract with Regan Bros , .fe Co , for the building of the basement or the city hall , therefore be it Resolved , Thnt the council approve and sustain Mr. Balcombo' In his action nnd that the board of publlu works IKS nnd is hereby instructed to at once take the necessary steps to enter into n new contract for its comple tion. tion.Councilman Councilman Kicrstead said that Mr. Bal combo had the interests of the city at heart and the council should sustain him. Councilman Ford compared Mr. Uulcombc to the czar of Russia , a sort of a supreme being in his own mind who Ignored the or ders of the council. Ualcombu , Ford alleged , was neglecting his work and was not in his ofllco half the time , un'd wound 4ip his tirade of abuse by giving Mr. Balcombo fair warn ing that there were men In thu council who would not put up with his assumption any longer. Ford favored letting Regan Brothers go ahead with the work. Councilman Lowry moved as an amend ment to Councilman ICiersteud's resolution that Regan Brothers bo directed to go ahead with the work. Councilman Hascall said it xvns a good thing for Omaha that n supcrstnict- uro was not put up on the con tract in vogue with Regan Brothers and the plans nnd specifications tarnished by the architect. Thu latter were indeUnlto and de fective , and wore the direct cuuso of the ex istlng trouble between thu chairman of the board of public works and Ucgan Brothers and Brcnnan. Mr. Balcombo was blamed by the speaker for letting the contract for fin ishing the basement and building the super structure of Nevlns , k Co. without advertis ing , us U required by the law. Councilman Alexander considered that the board had u perfect right to annul the con tract , with Itegan brothers. Ho was oppontsd to thu tutting of thu contract us conU'inpIuted by the board of publlu. works. The sum of $10,000 , for HnUbing the basement wus too inucti money.

Further discussion of the subject wa.s closed. The ordinance confirming certain rights to thu Omaha market com pany was referred back favorably by the ordinance committee , nmV created considerable talk. Councllmcn Ford , Lee und Bedford wore opposed to blocking up Harney , or any other streets with market houses. Further action was postponed for ono week upon the council adjourning , The Troublesome Question of Twen tieth Street's Width. No bids were yesterday received by the board of public works for the grading of cither Dodge between Twcntv-sccond und Twenty-fourth streets or Twentieth street between Davenport and Cuss. This is all the more surprising because it was thought the Cable Tramway company would put in a bid ixs Itvan anxious to have completed the work which It started some time ago. Ono of thu reasons which has doubtless operated against bidding has been the fact that the work b-iing mainly of n surface character , there wus not enough , In view of approaching winter to attempt to make money on. As a consequence of this failure to sccuro bids , the board will ask no more on this work , before next spring , when the question of narrowing Twentieth street will ngain bo brought up. Notwithstanding the beauty of some of the residence property on that thoroughfare , judging from thosu who huvo ulreudv been to sec the chairman of the board of public works upon the matter , there will bo found many who favor grading thu street to u width o'f 100 fuel , even if lawn and trues must bo sacri ficed. The majority of these live on the northern part of the streft and hold thnt when the cable lines and street car line run together , they will leavu not even room enough for a baby cart between the outside track and thu curb. To obviate this difficulty , they claim , thu street must be graded to the full width. Yesterday afternoon thu following bids were opened for the grading of Farmim street from Thirty-sixth street to the city limits , there being

This resolution was adopted , Messrs. Mayne and Heimrod voting nye nnd Chair man Bnlcombe no. Mr. Maynu then offered the following : Resolved , That the action of this board on November 17 , 1887 , cancelling the contract with Regan Brothers for building the base ment of the city hall bo madu and the chair man is hereby instructed to notify Regan Brothers to proceed at once and finish the said work according to the original contract. Considerable discussion foliowinl this and Mr. Hehnrod asked for time to consult legal authority before voting on the measure. The board therefore adjournud until 7 p. m. Just before the board convened in the even ing there was quite a lively scene , in which Messrs. Maynu , Rothacker nnd Lowry fig ured , caused by thu introduction of the reso lution , and although there were some pretty worm words bandied back and forth , no blows were struck. Thu first things considered In the evening session were the bids for the grading of Far- nain street from Thirty-sixth street to the city limits. Mr. Maynu moved that the con tract bo awarded to Hugh Murphy. Mr. Huimrod moved that it bo awarded to D. A. .Tansen. The ballot resulted in one vote for Murphy and two for Jtinbon. Mr. Muyno again presented his resolution In regard to allowing Regan Bros , to proceed with the work on thn city hull basement , but it was rejected , Mayno voting aye and Bul- coinbe and Heimrod no.
