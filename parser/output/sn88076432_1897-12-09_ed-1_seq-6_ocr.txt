THOUSANDS of American citizens where given the marble heart by means of President McKinley's message to congress this week and will now realize how little was in the ante-election glad hand. Ex-GOVERNOR CHURCH died Thanksgiving Cay at Juneau Alaska. He was governor of Da kota during the territorial days, receiving his appointment during Cleveland's first administration. IT is quite generally .rumored that the St. John branch of the Gt. Northern will be extened next summer to Brandon, Man. This would undoubtly mean daily pas senger service for the people out that. way. THE 

COURIER-DEMOCRAT illus trated editicu last week was a good one and shows up the six business blocks of Langdon town nicely. The C-D is giving the Langdon people a fine paper.— Walhaila Mountaineer. FARMERS in the south end of the county are in many cases drop ping grain for stock with encour aging results. This is setting the men of Milton thinking and it is likely that J. B. Beauchamp's cheese factory will be moved from Olga to that town. LIVE stoci statistics of North Dakota shows au aggregate of 217,263 horses, 3S65 mules 270, 193 cattle, 297,271 sheep, and 88, 150 hogs. These figures compared with last year show a wonderful increase in cattle and hogs, but a slight falling off in horses and sheep. JUDGE SAUTER was called to Bismarck last week to try the criminal libel suits brought against Editor Moffat, of the Settler. Change of venue was taken to Morton county, it being found impossible to secure an un prejudiced jury in Burleigh county' The cases will be called at the April term. No TROUBLE to get state office in North Dakota under a republican administration. Any old thing goes. Look at Joe Devine, elected lieutenant governor and for nearly six months has pursued the un disturbed even tenor of his way studying law at Ann Arbor, Michigan. "What a dog in the manger outfit the whole gang is anyway. UNDOUBTEDLY the effort will be made at the coming session of con gress to enact currency legislation that will be satisfactory to Wall street. This will mean the calling in of the treasury and Sherman notes, leaving national bank notes as our only currency and probably placing the burden of their re demption upon the government. Of course it is their plan (the goldbugs) to contract the volume of currency with a consequent further reduction of prices as a result. Farmers do you think this republican financial plan will give give you even the present prices of your products? The gold crowd will attempt to face the measure at the coming session, for they, rightly, are afraid that the complexion ot the next congress will be too white and not yellow enough to suit their purpose 'k They evidently believe that it is good policy to "Make bay while l& 

'ONLY SCORCHED. THE personal organ of congress man Dingley, whose name is attached to the revenue deficit tariff law, remarks, after surveying the results of the last election, that the silver question was "only scorched, not settled, that the con gressional campaigns of next year will be fought out on the line of 1896. This statement is the result of the out come of the recent elec tions, in which Kentucky and Nebraska showed how they would vote next year and the year after. Mr. Dingley's personal organ seems to think that Nebraska should see in the rise in wheat a "refutation of the Bryan theory that wheat and silver are linked together by the Almighty." Of course Mr. Bryau has no such theory as that, and the men have uever advanced any such argument. What they did and do say is that owing to the fact that the silver using nations compete with our wheat growers in the world's markets, the prices of wheat and silver, under ordinary conditions, rise or fall together. That has been demonstrated by the statistics of twenty-odd years, a ad is today confirmed by the fact that wheat rises in price when there is no competition from silver-using nations. These countries have had no wheat for export this year, and, consequently, the price has risen. Nebraska also sees what every body else must see—that the in crease in the price of wheat is simply the depieciation of the dollar with respect to that cereal. So far as wheat is concerned., the dollar has lost nearly half of its purchasing power, so that all the good that has been accomplished by the rise is the result of a sinful and an immoral 50-cent dollar. With respect to "scorching" and "burning," we think Mr. Dingley's organ makes a full, though per haps unintentional admission that the republican party was some what scorched in the recent elec tions. Next year it will be still more thoroughly scorned, and in 1900 it will b9 badly burned. That seems to be the outlook now. But we think Mr. Dingley's organ would help its party some what if it could convince the peo ple that the Dingley law is pro ducing revenue instead of creating a deficit. The figures show that the excess of expenditures over receipts are $45,500,(00 this year as compared with $20,090,000 in 1895. Is this the result that Mr. Dingley intended to produce? ONE of the members of McKin ley's executive cabinet, Hon. Lyman J. Gage, who is secretary of the treasury and owns a big national bank in Chicago, is at loggerheads with the president on the finance question. His latest move, evidently mtde in accord with expressed views of his brother bankers of Wall and Lombard streets is to retire the greenbacks and issue gold bearing bonds for them, turning the bonds over to the national banks and have them issue their promises to pay in place of the government's promise to pay. McKinley knows as well as all other quiet thinking men that the frantic clamoring of the. gold-bugs is without avail. That we are not doing business on a gold-basis and furthermore are unable to because we haven't the gold to do it with. Both "Mac" and the people are "onto" the three card monte game that retary Gage would like to in. .33 Sec- "ring
