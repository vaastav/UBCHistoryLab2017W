Well, it's a bad time of the year to be out of meat. The Cash-Book claims to have "more than double the circulation of the noiBy and reckless Democrat." The Piedmont Leader favors J. T. Ake, for Register of Lands at Ironton Mr. Ake is peculiarly fitted for the of fice. Reynolds Outlook. W. A. Munger is now one of the ed itors of the Reynolds Outlook, Bro, Khriver havin? taken him in. The editors have our best wishes. The old Cooper house, about one mile southeast of Frederlcktown, was 'destroyed by fire last Friday week. It was occupied by Mr. Jos. Stevenson. The contents were nearly all saved. ' Since John Sherman has been elect ed president of the Senate, the Jeffer son IJtmocrat thinks all good people ought to heartily pray for life and good health to Grover Cleveland. Amen! ; J. Logan Nations has been raising Cain again. The other day he tried to " force a young lady to elope with him Why the nation don't the good peo ple of his section (Ripley county) abate him? . ;' ; The Poplar Bluff Citizen says: 'C as good an article of butter and cheese be made in this county as is made in ' other localities?" The asking of the . question Is a slap at the Butler county . butter-makers. Dr. L. W. PUleywas one of the pas sengers , aboard the "Sunny South,' which was burned at New Madrid last Saturday week. He, as well as all others on the boat,' escaped, but at the baggage went up in the fire. Work on the Farmiogton courthouse progresses slowly. The foundation was finished last week only, and this is mighty poor weather for brickwork The contractors, by the terms of the bond, were to have had the building under roof in two weeks. Centre ville had a fire last Thursday airs, saran eny's resilience ana con tents were burned, the neighbors be ing unable to save anything. The alarm was given about two o'clock in the morning, and the family were ab sent. There was some insurance. . Potosi is putting on airs and feeling - big because Gen. Hazen has made her 'a signal-service station. The cold " wave flag went up fir the first time - last week, floating from the pole over Postmaster Teasdale's quarters. By j the way, we desire right now and here to congratulate Mr. T. upon his get ting safely and securely "in." The ' society ladies of De Soto are "after" the fashion editor of the Watch- . man. He has been reporting some of : the toilets worn by the prominent ladies at a late swell wedding. He gave it to 'em strong about two and a half columns. We read those columns with admiration and envy, and in our ignor ance sigted for that editor's knowledge of lacet., and surahs, and biases, and things. With somewhat of gleeful vin dictiveness, we therefore reproduce the winding-up of abetter from a wrathfu dame to his rivals pap-. These exasperatm.Ihhvminduce us to hope the next time cards affe Bent to the r Watchman, that the fashion editor will have the measles or be too busy to attend; and advise him in future to confine his flights of fancy to the congratulations, where he seems to be at home, if not truthful. Patience is a virtue most ladies possess, but it won't bear much strain when a fashion editor, who don't know full-draped fronts from full draped backs, makes of his descriptions such hopeless muddles and calls a floral canopy an umbrella. The Cape Girardeau News wil ' change to an all-at-home next week. There are now four papers in the South east who have dropped "patents" with in the past three months. This virtu - ous spurt of home production will probablv-Iast through six months, and then weexpect to see the adventurous spirits return, lank in pocket, short in circulation, but rich inexperience. The faot is a "patent" used,but not abused, is a necessity these days. On our sub . acription list are many subscribers who take no other paper than the Regis ter. Do vou suppose tbey would be as well satisfied if the paper were all at home? Brethren, let us reason to- - trether: take the last week's edition of the Registeb, tor Instance. In add tion to eight columns of home reading, and twenty columns of advertising, we, through our patent aide, gave our readers twenty-six columns of good, wholesome, interesting matter. Of . these, six columns contained compiled news from all over the world, the ed iting of which would keep the ordina ry country editor busy three days in the week; six columns contained varied reading wit and humor, scientifio mis cellany, household recipes, etc.; the President's message took six more: to the details of the funeral of the late Vice-Presideut were given three col umns; and the remainder of the space was taken up by a aerial story, politi cal matter, agricultural reading, etc. With the opening of Congress or the 1 assembling of the Legislature com mence boiled down reports of their pro ceedings. Not a bill or resolution in troduced into either body, but that the reader of this paper has the faot set be fore him. au our all-at-home breth-, ren do so much for their subscribers? We think not. The abuse of "patents" lies in neglecting the home part of the paper, and depending on the excellence of the "inside" to carry it through. Do your duty to your side of your pa per, dear brother, aud you may safely set down the subscriber who objects to the 'tother side as well, as as defi cient in judgment. , t Ex-Governor B. Gratz Brown died at his residence at Kirkwood, shortly after 7 o'clock last Sunday . morning. He first complained of Illness on Thurs day, and his demise was hastened by imprudently leaving.his bed while suf fering from pneumonia. The eminent jurist, was born at Lexington, Ky., May 28, 1826. He inherited his powers of mind, by natural succession, his grandfather being at one time presi dent pro tern, of the senate, and his father winning fame as a jurist. Young Gratz took his classical course at Tran sylvania university, Lexington, and stepped from there to Yale college in 1845, where he graduated in 1847. On his return to Lexington he was admit ed to the bar. Iu 1849 he moved to St. Louis. In 1852 he was elected to the legislature as a freesoiler, and two years later became editor of the Mis souri Democrat. During the heated discussion of slavery questions prior to the rebellion, he was again elected to the legislature, and warmly advocated freedom for the negro. In a duel with Thomas C. Reynolds, growing out of the election excitement, Mr. Brown was wounded in the knee. Mr. Brown was instrumental in raising the first three months regiment in the state, and went to the front as a colonel. He was shortly advanced to the rank of general, and did good service in South western Missouri. In 1863-4 the legis lature sent him to the senate, but. ow ing to ill health, he wa9 compelled to resign. In 1870 by a coalition of dem ocrats and republicans he was elected governor of Missouri by a majoritg of 41,917 votes. He was afterwards nom inated tor vice-president of the United States on the ticket with Horace Greeley. Of recent years the ex-gov ernor devoted himself to his law prac tice, but died a comparatively poor man. The funeral took place from his late residence on Tuesday, and was largely attended. May he rest peace! ,
