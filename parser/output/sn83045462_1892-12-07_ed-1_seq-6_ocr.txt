W"siegton is safering from a freight bleek ads, and as a natural sequence there is wrath in the hearts ot Washington merchants and pro fanity on many lips. Never sins rairoeads frst entered the District of Columbia has there been greater diseontent with freight handbag methods than is apparent in about every business establiahment in the city. Men who have for years been struggling to build up reputations for meeknese and every day piety no longer endeavor to con ceal the warmth that Is within them when ay one makes mention of rail road Wights. Go where you will-end a 4Ta reporter wandered haphasard Oto a num ber of stores and omes this morning-the growl is just as loud and just as long as it possibly could be. Mod ern railroads are supposed to eliminate distance from mercantile calculations, but the roads that walk into Washington (they used to run in. but they don't do that any more) are only making the element of distance more con pionous. LOOKING Poe waTEn OoWVmICATIOu. A tew of the business men who have suffered most from the delays are on the verge of de spair, and several of them are figuring out how best to establish satisfactory water com munication with Baltimore, Philade~pbia and New York. for only by some such method can they get easterq freight within a reason able period. They cannot, however, map out a water rout. from the west, and as there is greally more trouble with western freight than with that coming from the east they don't know just what to do That is why so many of them swear. Judging from a number of interviews secured today the situation is very bad indeed. It less bad on one road as it is on another. and, as a grumbling Irishman said, "perhaps a trifle worse." Most of the persons seen wanted to know why Congress did not permit the Norfolk and 'Western road to come into the city, and there was pretty general condemna tion of the Pennsylvania and Baltimore and Ohiom anagementfor eforts which were alleged to have been made to keep the new line outside the District. The demand in for increased activity on the part of cotopanles now in here or the Introduction of such corporations as want to do businese with the people of Wab ington. oxE xxncuAlr's uxPuasuan. "This freight blockade is extremely serious," said Mr. Frank Hume, the wholesale grocer, to I a STan reporter, who met him on the street. "There is no choice between the roads; one 1 is just as bad as the other. It seems to me that the companies are not aware of the fact that Washington is doing very much I more business today than it was five years ago. Our trade has grown immensely, and yet the freight facilities 'of the companies are no better today than they were when the I volume of traffic was not half as great. I .Quite frequently it takes a month to bring any thing from Baltimore here, while freights from the west are moving in on good time if I they reach here within twice t't period. Ever since early in October we have had a car of hominy on the road from Cincinnati; I suppose it will be along about spring time, when nobody eats hominy. If the companies I have not sufficient room here to conduct their business properly why don't they buy the prop erty they need? If they have sufficient room why do they place their business in the hands of incompetent subordinates? I don't mean to say that their subordinate~are incom petent, but it would necessarily follow that I such is the cane if the companies have a sui cient quantity of space at their command." L 3'caRTY "KICKs." "l am a kicker," said Mr. D. J. McCarty, the contractor. "It would tire me to figure out how much money I have lost through delays caused by the railroad people. Never was the trouble so great as it is at this time. When anybody complains they try to switch him off the track with pleasant little fairy tales about the Grand Army encampment 1 and the manner in which it hung the freight up. Any one would naturally suppose that by this timo the situation would have improved somewhat, but instead of improving it is getting worse right along. Just imagine what a serious fix a contractor is in when he is under heavy bonds to complete a building before a cer tain date, and cannot do it because the railroad company has his car load or two or three or four car loads of iron sidetracked any whe: . from fifteen to fifty miles away. I want more railroads and would like to have two or three of them in a hurry." woasE THANc I'nmNG TE wAn. "For twenty-one years I have done business 1 in the city of Washington," said H. O. Towles, the furniture dealer. "and have never in all that period been so much annoyed by freight troubles as I have been during the past six months. It makes me feel like shooting everybody connected with the railroad I freight carrying. It takes two'months to get shipments here from Chicago and about as long from Detroit. This is bad enough, but when you add to it the annoy ing and unprofitable fact that freight was never so carelessly handled you have a riev ance of more than ordinary proportions. There is carelessness somewhere, for the amount of freight coming in bad condition and the num ber of pieces lost is steadily Increasing. D~o you know that the situation Is actually wore than It was during the war, when every thing camne in and~ went out on the Baltimore andi Ohio over a single track? I find it pays me to get everything I can get from New York. Philadelphia or Baltimore by steamer; the shipments get here on time and undamaged. Under present railroad conditions we can do but little business with Virginia, for the Penn sylvania road insists on the transfer of all freight at Alexandria. I am an earnest advo cate of ihcresed railroad facilities. Give us one or two new roads. Let the Norfolk and1 Western conme In." A 

NONTH FnoU PUILADELPHIA. "In all my life I have never had so much trouble about freight as I am having now." said Mr. B. F. Guy, the dealer in stoves, "It frequently takee a month to get any thing from 'hiladelphaia; two weeks seems to be about the reguarschedule. Goods I have ordered have ben promptly shipped, and when they failed to make their appearance three weeks after shipment I had the firm du plicate my order. Two weeks later both orders came on the same day." wOt-LD NoT aE TOLERATED EIsnwmEBE. "Freight conditions as they exist here would not be tolerated elsewhere for one day," said Mr. James F. Oyster, who deal, in such perish ablee as butter and eggs. "Twice or three; time the necessary amount of timme is consumed in the tranaportation of almost every shipment. liomething ought to be done, and done soon." ,DEE&Y is TuE aULE. "When freight is on the road eleven days be tween Culpeper and this city there is some thing wrong with the railr'oad," said Mr. Boller of the Bria of Miller b Roller, commission merchants. If theae delays were only occasional they might be overlooked, but they are the rule and not the exception. Not very long ago we hadt a lot of hive calves and turkeys shippe frees Whitewater station, about ten miles beow Quantico; it took just a week to bring them up here after the mall road company had received them. One shipment of pork made from Eernon Va, was two and a half days on the road; it sol have been here in three hours. Of course It was damaged by the delay and we lost money." TaasavanT DAT. "You can't say too much nor abn ye say anything that could be regarded as ezag gerated when you discuss this freight business," *said Mr. P. J. H~ae-11ci dealer in agraultural implesments and fertilisers. "There's trouble every day In the week and Instead of beeoming lees it growsecsinally. It Is bad enough when there is delay In trasperte-. tion on goods you have bought, hut It Is meek1 Iworse when t ie on gosyou have sold.

Pinally they succeeded in getting the public mind in such a condition that it became necee ary that there should be a temporary revolution that the people might test the honesty and wisdom of the men who told hem that their future happiness depended on ihe success of the democratic 'party. They are sow to be given the test. They are now placed in t position where they are called upon to bring forth their boundless blessings and distribute hem among the discontented people. Are hese blessings at their disposal? If they are sot the party will be convicted of - sis. pre enss, of lying and fraud, and an angry public will drive them out in disgrace. Then will :ome the lasting triumph of the protective policy. This restoration of the republicans I in not expect to sea long delayed. I believe hat we will come into power in the House after the very next congressional election. 

DUTT or Tes DENOCRAT5. "As Mr. Harrison points out in his message, he democrats must act at once. They have a tuty to perform. They cahnot delay it and re ain any reputation for honesty. It is a matter of regret that this work must be delayed 'or at least three months; tn that state nut the President points out to the lemocrate with the most withering irony the ,bligaton before them-to get at it. They hould be Impatient. If the people are being obbed they cannot stand by for a moment. tfter they have the power in thqir hands, and ee it done. If they do they will be accessory to he crime. If they revise the tariff on the ines indicated by their platform and their peakers we shall elect the next House by a age sgajority; if they do not they will confess o their fraud. We can afford to stand pat on he President's message and wait for their dlay. "I do not think there will be any difficulty bout the democrats organizing the Senate. I ope not. We do not want a republican Senate o stand between them and the responsi ility they have taken upon themselves. Vberever there is doubt as to. the elec ion of a Senator and the democrats ave a fair show for success we should let them ave it. If the Senate is republican when the mack. hasicleared away I hope that the good 1ord will interpose in some way to take the sajority from us."
