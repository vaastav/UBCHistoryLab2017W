MESSAGE IN HOUSE AND SENATE RECEIVED WITH NO DEMONSTRA TION BY EITHER BODY, Icretary Carlisle Forward the Appropri ation Estimate Republican Perplex. Ity fu the Senate a to Sllverltes. "Washington, T. a Dec 7. Trie United States senate began the second session of the Fifty-fourth congress with crowded pelleries, and with that accompaniment pf activity and of greeting that usually ittends the re-assembling of congress. But the upper branch of congress never puts aside its dignity, and the meeting developed no demonstrations or dramatic Incidents. The reading of the president's message was the reature of the proceed ings, and beyond this no attempt was made to enter upon the business of the session. To many of the foreign repre sentatives occupying the diplomatic gal lery the message had special interest and Bignificance, owing to the part they had taken in the conspicuous foreign events to which the president referred. Sir Julian Pauncefote, the. British ambassa dor, and the new Turkish minister, Mus tapha Bey, were present Senor Dupuy De Lome, the Spanish minister, was not In attendance during the day, but two of the secretaries of the Spanish legation carefully noted the references to the Cu ban conflict. Minister Hatch of Hawaii and Mr. Cooper, the Hawaiian minister of foreign atfairs, were listeners, al though the message contained no refer ence to the -Hawaiian islands. The dip lomatic gallery was vacated as soon as the foreign questions referred to in the message .had ben read. On the floor of the senate printed copies of the message were distributed and these gave the sen ators an opportunity to read the salient Eeaturea'instead of listening to them. As a. result there was scant attention after the reading had proceeded beyond the first half hour. The reading of the mas sage took one hour and fifty minutes, nd at its conclusion the senate ad journed. While the scenes attending the open ing of the house today Tvere boih bril liant and interesting, in the crowds that thronged the galleries and the conspicu ous perspnages present, the proceedings themselves were dull and spiritless, be ing distinctively routine. The house met the chaplain invoked the divine" Wess big on the work of the session, the roll was called, a committee consisting of Mr. Cannon of Illinois, Mr. Payne of tCew York and Mr. Turner of Georgia, was appointed to wait on the president and the latter's annual communication was read. The reading consumed about two hours. It was Mr. Cleveland's fare well message and there was much curi osity as to his views, on Cuba especially, but there was no demonstration, either Df approval or dissent, throughout Its reading. The holiday nature of the day was sadined by the announcement of the death of ex-Speaker Crips, which Mr. Turner of Georgia formally made to his associates. Out of respect to the mem ory of the distinguished Georgian, the bouse, after adopting appropriate resolu tions, immediately adjourned. 

SEXAT32 GETS TOGETHER Seventy Members Attend to Koutino First Day .Business. Washington, r. C, Doc. 7. The senate chamber was a center of interest long before the hour for assembly had arrived and by 11 o'clock the public galleries 5ere well filled and crowds were at the Kitiance unable to gain admission. Sir Julian Pauncefote, accompanied by mem bers of his staff and several members of the diplomatic corps, were in the gallery reserved for foreign representatives and with them were several ladies bearing cards from Secretary Olney. In the seats reserved for the vice-president's family and friends, sat Mrs. Ste vensan and several other ladies. Back of them in the seats reserved for the fam Hies of senators, were many of the wives and daughters of those prominent on the Boor. The gallery crowds found ease End comfort in the new theater seats, put in since the last session closed, al though it resulted In reducing the seat ing capacity almost one-half. The senators were rather late in arriv ing. Mr. Palmer (Dem. 111.,) came In about 11.30, and was the center of inter est of the galleries, owing to his promin ence in the recent campaign. Mr. Till man of South Carolina also came in for considerable attention, as he went to his desk and busied himself with writing. Exactly at 12 o'clock the vice-president entered the chamber and, going to the desk of the presiding officer, gave a tap which brought the senate to order, while the blind chaplain, Rev. Dr. Millburn, delivered an impressive invocation. The chaplain referred feel5"ly to the illness of Mr. Allison and besought his fcpedy restoration to health. He spoke of the recent exciUng political contest through which the country had passed, marked, he said, by a freedom from much of the rancor and scandalmonger Ing of former years and by a quick and balm acceptance of the results of the whole nation. Peace with all nations, prosperity to our industries and the up building of all our people in the grand brotherhood of American citizenship were eloquently invoked. The roll call showed seventy senators present. Mr. Cullom was the first to re ceive recognition and .his resolution that the house of representatives be notified that the senate was in session and ready to proceed with business was agreed to without comment. Mr. Hale followed with a resolution that the daily hour for meting be 12 o'elock, meridian, which was agred to. Mr. Sherman made the customary mo tion for a committee of senators and members to wait upon the president and " upon its adoption the presiding officer - named Mr Sherman and Mr. Smith (Dem 2. J.,) as the senators of the committee. Mr. Morrill (Rep. Vt,1 was the first to suggest anythlngin tie nature of legislative-business by presenting several peti tions asking for the passage of the Ding ).Jey bill. He yielded, however, to Mr notrs suggestion that all business bo deferred as a matter of courtesy until the president and house of 'representa tives iad been communicated with and thereupon at-12.15 p. m., the senate took a recess until 1 o'clock. , Most of the senators remained in their eats while the reading of the president's message proceeded and followed it with much interest throughout its stages. Printed copies were distributed and the senators ran through these, picking out the most salient features and anticipat ing the formal reading. At the conclusion of the reading of the president's message the senate adjorun ed at 3:30 p. m. After the first hour of the reading, the reserved galleries were well-nigh empty and the senators, who had run through the printed copies, turned to other busi ness, whispering in groups, and retiring to the cloak rooms. Mr. Morgan, who was prominent during the Cuban debate of thelast session, made notes while the Cuban branch was being read. Mr. Gor man showed noticeable interest in the president's summary of the receipts and expenditures of the year. The venerable Mr. Morrill was one of the few senators to keep the printed mes sages before him from beginning to end of the reading. Mr. Frye also followed it throughout. The main interest was seen in the first and last parts of the message, wherein the president's personal views were ex pressed, the interest lagging on the re view of departmental branches of the service. The reading of the message closedat 3:35 p. m., having taken just one hour and ilifty minutes. The president's clos ing reference to trusts and monopolies was carefully followed by Mr. Sherman author of the anti-trust law to which the president referred. After the usual formality of laying the message onThe table, the senate, on mo tion of Mr. Hale (Rep. Me.,) adjourned. 

ASSEMBLING OV THE HOUSE Cresldent's Message qeu One Broad Smile But no Applao.se. Washington, Dec. 7. The house pre sented a very animated scene for an hour before Speaker Reed appeared. The galleries, to which the public were ad mitted without cards, were crowded to the doors before 11 o'clock, while the halls were jammed with those unable to gain entrance. The reserved galleries filled more slowly, but before 12 o'clock were brightened with the handsome gowns of fair women. From the floor below rose the Indescribable buzz of many voices as the members exchanged greetings, with much handshaking, after the manner of college students meeting again after the long vacation. There were reminiscences of the campaign, ex planations of defeat, exploitations of vic tory, congratulations and condolences. The aisles were crowded with outsiders, many of them local politicians, already besieging their members for the fruits of service rendered, lobbyists already press ing for the consideration of bills in which they were interested, and old com plainants, hoping against hope that tnis session would see the consummation of their long-deferred desires. But in the midst of this general re joicing there was an air of sadness, as members glanced at the black pall which covered the conspicuous desk of the late ex-Speaker Crisp, the Democratic lead er. On it were some cut flowers. His portrait in the lobby in the rear of the house was especially apparent on the Democratic side, where his loss wilLbe so keenly felt. On the desk of Mercer of Nebraska, secretary of the congressional campaign committee, was a huge shield of crysan themums and American beauty roses across which was written in large let ters the word "Secretary," while on that of Mr. Babcock of Wisconsin, chairman of the committee, was a miniature chair of rose3 and soft .nosses. There jvere many conspicuous personages both on the floor and in the galleries. M. Pater notre, the French ambassador, and sev eral other diplomats with him. As the hands of the clock pointed to 12, Speaker Reed quietly entered the hall and ascended the rostrum. He was at tired ia a black frock coat and looked bronzed and vigorous. jrThe silver mace, the emblem of the authority of the house, was lifted to its place on the green malachite podestal to the right of the rostrum, and with a sharp crack of the gavel, the speaker called the house to order. The hum of conversati 3.T instantly ceased, and the galleries became rulet. Rev. Cowder of Michigan, the blind chaplain of the house, offered the invoca tion. His prayer was simple, but im pressive. When it was finished the speak er ordered the clerk to call the roll. "While this formality was in progress the members resumed their felicitations. Thf roll call showed the presence of 271 members. As soon as the speaker an nounced the presence of a quorum and that the house was ready to proceed to business, a dozen members demanded re cognition, but the speaker first received the usual message from the senate, stat ing that the senate had a quorum pres ent and was ready to proceed to busi ness. The usual formal resolution for the ap pointment of a committee to join a sim ilar committee of the senate to inform the piesident that the house was ready to proceed to business, and another di recting the clerk to inform the senate that the house was prepared to proceed, were adopted. The speaker appointed Mr. Cannon of Illinois. Mr. Payne of New York and Mr. Turner of Georgia to constitute that committee. The selection of Mr. Turner was con sidered a significant indication that the Georgia member would succeed ex Speaker Crisp as member of the commit tee on rules, as it was a formal recogni tion of him as the leader of the Demo cratic side. In order to await the presi dent's message, the house, on motion of Mr. Henderson of Iowa, took a recess until 1:30. The house took a further recess until 2 o'clock and then Mr. Pruden, the pres ident's clerk, presented the message, which was read by direction of the speaker. The opening words of the message, Congratulating the country on the result of the election, created a broad smile, the Democrats as well as the Republi cans seemingly enjoying the political condition which allowed a Democratic president to felicitate himself upon a vic tory gained under the banner of the Re publican party. The president's expres sions on Cuba ana Venezuela were list ened to attentively but there were no demonstrations, even when he an nounced that the administration some months ago had suggested home rule for Cuba to Spain, or when he announced the term'nation of the controversy be tween Great Britain and the Lnlted States over the Venezuelan ooundary Hne. . . There was not much Interest in the re mainder of the message, except those portions relating to the tariff, the cur rency and trusts. The reading of the massage occupied one hour and forty minutes. At Its conclusion, on motion, of Mr. Dingley (Rep. Me.,) the massage and accompanying documents, were re ferred to the committee of the whole on the state of the Union. Mr. Grow (Rep. Pa.,) showed a dispo sition to debate the massage, 'but yielded until a later time. Mr. Turner (Dem. Ga.,") then informal ly announced the "untimely death" of his late colleague, ex-Speaker Crips, and stated that at some further day he would ask the house to fix a day for paying tribute "to his distinguished character and eminent public service." A resolution presented by him reciting that the house had heard with profound regret the announcement of Mr. Crip's death, was adopted, after which, at 3:45 p. m., as a further mark of respect, the Continued on Sixth Pare.) 

WICHITA, KANSAS, TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8. PEOPLE WILL TALK WHAT THEY SAY OF THE MESSAGE IS VOBTH HEABIHG. Members of tke Ways and Means Commit tee la the Hoaie and of the Foreign Affairs Committees la the Uoase aad Senate Deliver Moch Apt Comment on the Docameat Joha Ball Admonishes Spain to Wake op, It's Time to Take Her Medicine, and the Junta People Express Disappointment. Washington, D. C, Dec. 7. Comments in the senate on the message were gen. erlly favorable to the tenor of the mes sage, on the Cuban question, though there were some opposing views express ed. A large number of senators, including a majority of the members of the commit tee on foreign relations, excused them selves from expressing opinions, on the ground that they had not given it care ful reading. Mr. Mitchell (Rep. Ore.,) The message seems to leave the Cuban situation as he finds it, refraining from any recommen dation as to congressional action. The president's quasi-endorsement of the ex isting tariff act will scarcely be accep table to Republicans who believe in the protective policy. Mr. Pettlgrew (Rep. S. D.,) It is the first time in our history that an execu tive who is the representative of a de feated party ever glorified, as Mr. Cleve land does in the first paragraph of this message, over the success at the polls of his party's opponents. Mr. Pritchard (Rep. X. C.,) The only noteworthy part of the message was that devoted to Cuba, and on that question it reminds me of the old rhyme: "He wired in and wired out and left the public still in doubht "As to whether the heart that made the track was coming in or going back." Mr. Pugh (Dem. Ala.,) The message is sound on Cuba, sound on tariff and especially sound on trusts and monopo lies. Mr. Brice (Dem. Ohio,) The president has handled the questions In as diplo matic a manner as possible. Mr. Nelson (Rep. Minn.) It is a fair statement as regards Cuba. Senator Tillman (Dem. S. C.,) It is commonplace. The best thing about It is that it is the last we will have from that source, at least the last annual mes sage. Mr. Morgan In the president's recital of the facts, and his statements of the moral duties of the United States toward the Cuban belligerents there is a response to the sentiment of the people, and. I believe, of the senate. In asserting that no other nation must interfere in the af fairs of Cuba there Is the most decisive and practical declaration of the Monroe doctrine that has yet been made. But while the president warns off all other nations, the message calls the great civil war an insurrection and on this false declaration justifies active aid to Spain m furnishing all kinds of military muni tions, while it refuses our people the right to send anything, even bread or "medicine, to the insurgents. I regret that this national action is so illogical and uijust and that it must still cost many lives and terrible suffering to a people who are admitted by the message to be at war for the sake of liberty, and not as a means of gaining power for per sonal ends. Senator Chandler (Rep. X. H.,) Its treatment of Cuba is elaborate and very strong. While not going as far as I wi3iied it would, it does, by implication from the last rentence, very plainly say that if Spain does not suppress the rebel lion very quickly the United States will be sure to intervene to secure the inde pendence of the island. The most nota ble feature in the message is the omis sion to mention the free coinage of sil ver or the currency question, except to make the useless recommendation that greenbacks be retired or not re-Issued whn they come to the treasury. In his brtef allusion to the tariff, Mr. Cleveland reiterates that the amount of duty al ways increases the cost to that amount but his feeble treatment of the tariff question compared with the vehement as saults made upon the tariff in previous messages is noticeable. The tone and temper of the whole message is is ex cellent and the fervid patriotism and in tense personal views shown in it are doubtless sincere. 

INTERVIEWS IX THE HOUSE Whn Foreign Affairs and Ways and Si cans Men Have to Say. Mr. Hitt of Illinois, chairman of the committee on foreign affairs, declined) emphatically, to give any expression up on the message. Mr. Heatwole (Rep., Minn.), member of the foreign affairs committee The president evidently has been impressed with the sentiment which has been voiced by the people of the country in regard to Cuba during the congressional recess. He seems disposed to Urge som action by the United States at the proper time, but fails to indicate when that time shall arrive. Mr. Cannon (Rep., 111.), chairmanofthe committee on appropriations The deficit since the beginning of Mr. Cleveland's present administration to December 5, 1S96. is $178,646,000. This has been paid from proceeds of the sale of bond. This defiiclt was $25,000,000 for the twel-e months ending June 30, 1S9G; but for a little over five months, from June 30 to December 5, 1S96, the deficit is more than S40.000.000, which shows that the president's confidence that the present tariff law, if allowed a fair opportunity, will yet yield sufficient revenue, is not well founded. In other words, the de ficiency in revenues is incrsasing and not diminishing. All of which demon strates the absolute necessity for reve nue legislation that will bring increased revenue. I do not believe it is practica ble to fund the United States reasury notes, although a provision giving the secretary of the treasury authority tem porarily to hold these notes in the treas uryas they are placed there in redemp tion or received from taxes would prob ably be wise. iThe president rivs we have a surplus of $12S,000,000 wmva can be devoted to curremt expenses. The proceeds are borrowed money. The tare statement of that fact shows th reces sity for increased revenue; and with revenue equal to expenditures, any sur plus in the treasury can be used in pay ment of the interest-bearing debt of the United States. I do not know what th facts are touching Cuba except as I gather them from the message. From a hasty reading of tne message I do not see but that wisdom dictates that con gress should await executive action and lecommendation as to Cuba. Mr. McMillln (Dem.. Tenn.), member of the ways and means committee I agree with the president in seeing no immediate necessity or excuse for in crease of tariff duties. The surplus on hand outside the gold reserve, with strict economy, probably will meet all de ficiencies in revenue for more than half of Mr. McKinley's administration and probably fcr the full four years. To in crease the tax on the necessaries of life in order either to squander or perma nently hoard this surplus is wholly in excusable. Mr. Cousins (Rep., Iowa), member of the foreign affairs committee It is v-:-' dent that the president occupies the savne .position that he has formerly. To be plain, he does not Relieve that the Ignit ed States has any right to Interfere,. d, to be equally plain, he feels, in a grfflfter degree than he has formerly expreSd, the sympathy of the American people for Cuba He seems to think it might be possible for a condition of affaigt-to exist in Cuba at some time, nojjone knows when, that would justify hjtter ference on higher grounds than thos&in volved in the ordinary rights of nations. What can be added to the situatkoijal ready existing to make it sufficiently serious to justify the interference w&Ich the president has in mind? d Mr. Taft (Rep., Ohio), member of jthe committee on foreign affairs The presi dent's treatment of the Cuban question as a whole may be considered as a for mal notice to Spain that the present con ditions cannot be prolonged indefinitely. Indeed, it lays a basis for an interven tion even before he goes out of office, or it gives him an opportunity to throw the question on the shoulders of the succeed ing administration. Probably he will pursue the latter course. , Mr. Bolllver (Rep., Iowa), membejr of the ways and means- committee The president's treatment of the Cuban ques tion is hardly satisfactory, either to .those who desire to see Cuban independ ence recognized or the class who desire the United States to keep clear o for eign disputes. Mediation by theUnited States would be in the direction of a set tlement acceptable to all parties, but the president's hint of what is lilrely to happen in case mediation be refised is a little too mysterious for practical pur poses. Mr. Dalsell (Rep., Pa), member of the ways and means committee The mes sage gives U3 no additional light on. Cuba. The Dresident assumes, from his information which is, no doubt, relia-, ble that the insurgents lucve no claim to possess a government praptal. I! this is true they are not entity to recog nition as belligerents and it -bllows tha t they could not be recognized-as possess ing independence- In his treatment of. the tariff the president is a Ittle wnflil in juggling with figures. He und-rtal:es to compare the operations of the Wfison bill one year with theame bill another year instead of with another bilL He thinks the Wilson bill is now of a -higher character than it was when he Tefused to sign it. He seems to fear that the country may have too much ieTenue and become extravagant; a fear in hich the neonle will not Join him. Representative Walker (Rep., 3lra?s.), chairman of the committee on banking and currency The best message Presi dent Cleveland has ever written. What he says about the weakness and Mcious- ness of our financial methods is i tating it mildly and ought to prompt tht com mercial organizers and bankejrs of the country to come to the assistance of the banking and currency committee with a bill carefully prepared that would rem edy the evils admitted to exist by every thoughtful financier. Representative Lacey (Rep., Iowa) President Cleveland is evidently anxious' to pass the Cuban question over to Major McKinley. There is no real solution of the question embraced in Ills message except that Spain had better sell Cuba before the property is all destroyed. Representative Livingston (Dijm., Ga.) The president has made a full and un auestionable showing in his message of the necessity for our interfeimce in Cuba now. 

CUBANS ARETrtSAFFOIlf JtjED Message Shows Igaoraae of the Subject and Mattejus swasa rt If Xew York, Dec. 7. The "Woirld will nublish the folowlng Interviews tomor row on the views of prominent Cubans on the president's message: Piedel Pierot. of the junta The mes sage as an enigma and puzzle I would have a far higher regard for Mr. Cleve land had he simply announced that the United States government was opposea to the cause of Cuban liberty and sym pathized with Spain's efforts to crush the revolution. The message will not make a particle cf difference one way or the other, so far as the revolution, is con cerned. If the svldlers of Gomez and Maceo realize that the message means that the United States will not raise a finger t' atop Weyler's "butcheries-, they will fight with that terrible energy born of desDaK C.e eland's talk about au- tonomv only shows how little he really knows" of the real state of affairs. The idea of autonomy is dead. Scarcely any one in Cuba, even among the Spanish thmeselves, consider it seriously. The autonomist paity vent to pieces mouths ago. For us now there are lert only tne two alternatives independence or ex termination. Manuel A. Recio de Morales I resign ed my position as a leader of the Re formist party, which Is similar in its aims to the Autonomist, because I be came convinced that absolute independ ence is all that can save Cuba. Dr. Henry O. Zayas The president's message is decidedly unsatisfactory to both sides. The Cubans have a right to expect more, but the consolation remains that he treats Spain with the scorn which she deserves for her weak and cruel rule. Towards the end the presi dent promises that at some future time his attitude will be clearly defined. Let use hope then that he will act in accord ance with the expressed wish of the American people. Dr. Rafael Xavarre. of the Cu"ban san itary corps Cleveland does not say any thing in his message; he does not mean to say anything. It is words, words and only wordi. My hope is in congress. Mrs. Carlos Manuel, widow of the pres ident of Cuba during the last war Per haps Mr. Cleveland is really more fried ly to Cuba than his message would indi cate. From motives of policy, perhaps, he has refrained from expressing the sympathy he really feels. Delegates Estrada Palma and Joaquin Castillo declined to be interviewed, but declared through their secretaries that they would issue an official statement within a short time.

All of the news paper" this morning have editorials on President Cleveland's message. Most of them regard the message as one of rather minor importance, except so far as it concerns the Cuban question, to which pnase the buls of the comment is de- oted. The Daily News, the Liberal organ, says of the Cuban portion of the mes sage: "President Cleveland's argument is clear enough that no country possesses tne right to foster a perpetual source of trouble, and that Spain must either grant autonomy or selL Spain, however, will probably refuse to do anything of tae kind.

OLNEY BREAKS OVER DISBEGARD3 AH AB0IEHT STATE DEPARTMENT EULE. Make a Report et Hta Own J cut Like Other Cabinet OMcers, Which ia Presented Aleac With, aad Sappleaseatary to the President' Message, Which, aa Regard Caba aad Other Foreign Matters Toach ed Cpoa, is Oaly aa Echo of tha Sec retary's Docameat Foreign Affairs ia General. Washington, Dec. 7. For the first time within the memory of the oldest officials, the secretary of state has made a regular report to the president, for transmission to congress like the reports of other offi cers of the cabinet. This report was laid before congress today as an appen dix to the president's message. It treats on many details of our relations during the past year with torsi gn governments that either were not touched upon at ail in the message or were more briefly treated. 

SPAIX AXD CUBA. Under the head of Spain Secretary Ol ney has much to say in regard to Cuba and in his report he sets out in great de tail the story of the growth of the re bellion, the present evil state of affairs on the Island and other facts on which the president bases his broad statement and conclusions. Xo reference is made to a report from Consul General Lee, but the secretary intimates that his informa tion comes principally from the United States consuls and so must be regarded as confidential as to itssource. The sec retary's estimate of the present situation is. disclosed in the following paragraph, made after a preliminary statement of the destruction of the industrial re sources of Cuba. "From whatever point of view we, regard the matter it is Im possible not to discern that a state of things exist at our doors alike danger ous to good relations, destruction of le gitimate commerce, fatal to the interna tional resources of Cuba, and most vex atious and trying because entailing upon this government excessive burdens in its domestic adminIstration and Its outward relations. This situation cannot indefi nitely continue without growing still worse and the time may not be far dis tant when the United States must seri ously consider its rights and Interests as well as its international duties in view of its peculiar relations to this Island." 

WORST REBELLION YET. To begin with, the secretary makes it plain that the present insurrection is far more formidable than the famous "ten years insurrection" which began at Yara in 1S6S. He says that, starting the same portion of the Island, It very early took proportions beyond its prerecessor and assumed the aggressive phas?. Passing the defensive lines of the trochas traversing' the island from north to south, formidable bodies of the revo lutionary forces early in the year estab lished them selves in the rich sugar planting districts of Santa Clara and Cienfugces, made hostile forays almost in sight of Havana itself and advancing westward affected a lodgement ia the fertile tobacco fields of Pinar del Rio, which has so far resisted all efforts of the Spanish forces to overcome. The sec retary says that while no prominent sea port has been attacked by the insur gents, a large part of the 2,200 miles of sea coast Is practically in their hands, and from its rugged and wild character is peculiarly fitted for guerrilla warfare and affords easy means of holding clan destine supplies of men and arms. 

INSURGENT TACTICS. The secretary adds: "While thus In fact controlling the large part of the Is land of Cuba from Cape San Antonio to Cape Maisi, and enjoying practically an unlimited use of an equally large part of the coast the revolutionary forces are scattered, being now united for a length of time to form an army capable of at tack or siege and fit to take the defen sive in pitched battle. Assembling sud denly at a given point, often In a single night, they make unexpected sallies or carry destruction to the tobacco and canelields of Cuba and at the first sign of pursuit or organized assault they dis perse, only to reassemble in a like man ner at some other point." RECOGNITION IMPOSSIBLE. As bearing upon the question of recog nition of the insurgents which is to come up in some shape before congress, the following statement from Secretary Ol ney Is of importance in explaining his reasons for declining recognition: "So far as our information shows, there is not only no effective government by the insurgents In the territory they over run, but there is not even a tangible pre tense to establish administration any where. Their organization, confined to the shifting exigencies of military oper ations of the hour, is nomadic, without definite centres and lacking the most ele mentary features of municipal govern ment There nowhere appears the nuc leus of statehood. The machinery for the exercising of the legitimate rlght3 and powers of sovereignity and responding to the obligations which de facto eover eignty entails in the face of equal rights of other states is conspicuously lacking. It Is not possible to discern a homogene ous political entity, possessing and ex ercising the functions of administration, and one cabaple, if left to itself, of main taining orderly government in it3 own territory and sustaining normal relations with the external family of govern ments." AMERICANS IN CUBA. The secretary Illustrates his point as to the irresponsibility of the insurgents by citing their destruction of American plantations and oppression of American planters who grind cane, which he char acterizes as acts of anarchy. On the other hand, he shows that in the capital cities and seaports and all parts of the island which the United Suites or Its citizens maintain legitimate normal in tercourse the Spanish power is supreme, though often exercised in a vexatious and arbitrary way, calling for Just re monstrance, and that nvwt of the func tions of the government procetd as in time of peace Recurring to his comparison of this in surrection with those that have preceded it. Secretary Olney makes this significant statement: "From every accessible indication It la dear that the present rebellion is on a far more formidable scale as to numbers, in toIlJgeace and representative features than of the preceding revolts of this cen tury; &a t the corresponding effort of Spain for its repression has bn enor mously augmented, and that, despite the constant influx of fresh armies and ma terials of war from the metropolis, the rebellion, after nearly two years of rac cesful resistance, appears today in a con dition to indefinitely prolong the contest on its present lines." 

INSURGENTS COMPLIMENTED. He also compliments the tactical skill displayed by the leaders of the insurrec tion, saying tijat when the disparity of nambers and the comparatively indefen sible character of the central and west em vega. country are considered, the pzst saze of a considerable force In Pinar dei Rk, folia wed by its succsfnl mainte nance there for many month, must be regarded us a military success cf a pro nounced character.
