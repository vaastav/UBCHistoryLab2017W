After a litigation lasting 14 years the will disposing of a San Francisco estate once worth $75,000 has just been sus­ tained and litigation suspended, be­ cause the estate has been- exhausted in paying legal fees. Mrs. Gertrude Latty, of 563 South Franklin street Wilkesbarre, Pa., is the owner of a clock which may have been the original grandfather's clock, for Mrs. Latty is able to account for its ex­ istence for over 150 years. Mrs. Harriet R. P. Stafford, of Cot­ tage City, Mass., presented to the gov­ ernment the tirst flag bearing the stars 6nd stripes ever hoisted over an Ameri­ can vessel of war and the first that was ever saluted by a foreign naval power. A popular lecturer is quoted as say­ ing: "The first care in building a home is the selection of a proper place." This is trite. Nothing is easier than to se­ lect" a place. What the lecturer should have made clear was how to get- pos­ session of the place after it is selected. The Vermont legislature has passed a bill creating the office of attorney general of that state. Vermont has now no attorney-general, and the plan to establish the office had its origin, in Connecticut, where, for the first time this year, an attorney-general was voted for. An inventor has hit upon a method of putting stone soles on boots and' shoe's. He mixes a waterproof glue with a suitable quantity of clean quartz sand and spreads it over the leather sole used as a foundation. These quartz sole* are said to be very flexible and practically indestructible, and *o give the foot a firm hold even on the most slippery surface. The ingenuity of the counterfeiters now appears to be chiefly devoted to the turning out of bogus copper and nickel coins, rather, than those of larger denomination According to the report of the United States treasurer for the fiscal year, no less than 69,265 pieces of this character were detected last year, and they circulated chiefly in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Because of the fact "that 2,000,000 peo­ ple in Italy are attacked by the malaria every year, and 15,000 of that number die from the disease, a great society has just been formed in that country to study the malady, and if possible to master it. During the present year 63 provinces have been besieged' by ma­ laria and it has rendered impossible the cultivation of 5.000,000 acres of land. Reports from recruiting officers of the regular army show that during the month of November there, were nearly 4,000 enlistment's apd over 7,000 rejec­ tions. Of the enlistments 1,982 were in the general recruiting service and about 2,000 special were enlistments for particular regiments, Thfe figures indicate an increase rather than dim­ inution pf interest in the regular army service.

Four men—*-all of them veteran, sol­ diers'—playing with a gun. One goesi through the manual of arms and winds up with a burlesque of shooting at an­ other.

DEATH OF A PATRIOT. Close of the Career of the Noted Cuban Warrior, Gen. Garcia. Succumbs at Washington to ta At­ tack of Pneumonia His Dying Thonchti Were of His Coun­ try—Sketch of Hia Life. Washington, Dec. 12.—Gen. Calixto Garcia, the distinguished Cuban war­ rior and leader and the head of the commission elected by the Cuban as­ sembly to visit this country, died here Sunday morning shortly after ten o'clock at the Hotel Raleigh, where the commission has its headquarters. The sudden change from the warm climate of Cuba, with the hardships he had there endured, to the wintry weather of New York and Washington is re­ sponsible for the pneumonia which re­ sulted in his demise. He contracted a slight cold in New York, which did not assume an alarming stage until the early part of last week. On Tuesday night Gen. Garcia, in company with the other members of the commission, at­ tended a dinner given in his honor by Gen. Miles, and it was a result of the exposure that night which culminated in his death. Last Thoughts Were for Cnba. During the 12 hours or more pre­ ceding dissolution Gen. Garcia was un­ conscious most of the time. At inter­ vals he recognized one or more of those about him. In his dying moments, as all through his busy and active life, his thoughts were for his beloved country and its people, and among his last words were irrational mutterings in which he gave orders to his son, who GEN. GARCIA. is on his staff, for the battle which he supposed was to occur and in which he understood there were only 400 Span­ iards to combat. Just before he died he embraced his son. Rev. Father Ma gee, of St. Patrick's church, was called in during the day and was with Gen. Garcia until the end, administering the last rites of the Catholic church. Other members of the commission and Mr. Rubens, their council in this country, were also in the bed chamber when the end came. Cuban Officials Notified. After Gen. Garcia's death steps were taken to notify the government offi­ cials here and also the executive com-, mittee of the Cuban assembly, which has its headquarters at Marianao, Cu­ ba. Secretary Jose Villalon, of the commission, sent a telegram of notifi­ cation to Mendez Capote, the pres­ ident of the Cuban assembly, who is now in Havana. As soon as the death became known a number of visitors, in­ cluding many public men, came fo the hotel to express their condolences. President McKinley manifested his sympathy by sending a suitably word­ ed letter and Vice President Hobart sent his card. Among those who called were Senators Foraker, Money, Proc­ tor and Chandler and Maj. Gens. Law ton and Wheeler. Gen. Garcia left a large family, only one of whom, Justo, a captain on his staff, was with him when he died. His widow and Mercedes, a daughter 17 years of age, are at Thomasville. Ga., where the girl is quite ill Mario, a son 19 years of age, is with the mother at Thomasville, and Col. Carlos Garcia, another son, is in Cuba. A daughter. Leonora, who married an American, is now living in Paris. Gen. Garcia's mother is still alive and resides in Ha vana. Funeral arrangements have not been made. The members of the commission feel keenly the blow which has befallen them in the death of their leader, who they say was a man of intelligence, valor, energy and probity in whom the great majority of people had absolute confidence. The work in hand, they say, will continue without interruption and the ideas and views held by Gen Garcia will be impressed on all "that is done. While it is possible that an­ other chairman may be chosen by the Cuban assembly, yet the commission­ ers say that it is not essential, as those now here are thoroughly equipped to take up the work where their leader laid it down. Career of a Patriot and Warrior. Gen. Garcia, whose name will be ever linked with those of other patriots who have fought against unequal odds for the freedom of his country, has had a most ac­ tive and varied life, much of which has been spent In fighting for the cause of Cuban liberty, which be had the satisfaction of seeing accomplished so short a time before his death. He was a man of culture and re­ finement, of splendid education and came from a distinguished family of Jlguani. of Santiago de Cuba province. He was born in Cogquin, October 14,18S9, and was there­ fore In the sixtieth year of his age. Gen. Garcia was educated in Havana and In Spain. In ^864 hs was married to Isabel Veles. Gen. Garcia Was the original con­ spirator in the uprising of the Cubans against Spain In 1868 and in that war under Gomez be attained the rank of a brigadier general. In October of 1868 he captured the towns of Jalquani and Balre and recruited many hundreds of patriots. He had com­ mand of the eastern departments during that revolution after 1873 and won many notable victories, including those at Melones and Aures. While the revolution was in a critical state in the other prov­ inces and its outcome was uncertain he maintained it with vigor in the territory under his command. Preferred Death. In 1875 while reconnoitering with his es­ cort he was surrounded by 2,000 Spaniards. Preferring death to capture and subse­ quent execution at the hands of his enemy he attempted suicide by placing his re­ volver under his chin and firing. The bul­ let came out between his eyebrows. For months he lay between life and death, but was saved Anally by Spanish surgeons, who possibly had owed their lives to his mercy. The Spaniards believing he was about to die gave him a pardon. The hole which the bullet made when it entered the cbin and came out between the eyebrows »ae always visible and shows plainly in the calmness of death. For his participation tn the revolutionary movement Gen. Garcia was sent to Spain, where for years he was confined in castles and fortresses, remaining there until the peace of Zahjon. He then returned to the United States and together with Jose Marti, attempted another revolution. He landed in Cuba with a few followers, but the country was tired of war and wanted to try the home rule offered by Spain. He capitulated to the Spanish forces in order to save his few remaining followers and was again banished to Spain in 1880, where he remained under surveillance until 1895, when the last revolution broke out in Cuba. Then he escaped to France and later to New York. His movements since that time and his active participation in the war are familiar to many newspaper readers. After coming to this country he endeavored to get an ex­ pedition to the island of Cuba in the steam­ er Hawkins, but this met with shipwreck in a storm and the cargo was lost. Gen. Garcia was the last man to leave the ves­ sel. Undaunted- by his failure Gen. Garcia made another attempt to ship stores for the insurgents, this time obtaining the ship Bermuda. He was intercepted, however, by United States authorities and was ar­ rested on the charge of filibustering, but was released on $5,000 bail. He forfeited this bail and In a final attempt landed on the eastern coast of the island with one of the largest expeditions that ever reached Cuba. After landing he succecded Gen. Antonio Maceo in command of the troops for the eastern department, holding the rank of major general, Gen. Maceo march­ ing west with bis men. Succeeds Maceo. At Maceo's death Garcia was elected lieu­ tenant general of the Cuban army, which position he held to the close of the war During this command he assaulted and took by siege Tunas, Guisa and Guaimaro. and cleared the interior of his department o£ Spanish troops. After declarion of war between the United States and Spain, Gen. Miles, commanding the American army, sent his representative to Gen. Garcia and subsequently the American and Cuban gen­ erals cooperated in their movements against Santiago. Al! the officers who participated In the active work around Santiago bear testi­ mony to the great aid, assistance and loy­ alty manifested by Gen. Garcia during the campaign. When the Cuban assembly met at the close of the war Gen. Garcia was one of the principal advisers and was elected chairman of the commission directed to come to the United States and confer with the authorities here with reference to the work in hand. 

FLOOD IN BROOKLYN. Hose Water Main Bursts and Uamaife Estimated at $500,000 Results. New York, Dec. 13.—For several hours Sunday an area of 20 blocks in the Twenty-eighth ward in Brooklyn was inundated by raging waters, which washed out the foundations of houses, tore down trolley and telegraph poles imprisoned people in their houses and nearly drowned some who were caught by the flood. The damage will reach several hundred thousand dollars the police think $500,000. The great water main at Hobart street and Central avenue burst at five o'clock in the morn­ ing. This main is four feet in diameter and when the pressure became too great the water shot up eight feet in the air, tearing a hole in the pipe itself seven feet long and a half of its circum­ ference. For the first hour 1,500,000 gallons, it is estimated, rushed through the streets and there was little diminu­ tion for three hours. The flood came so suddenly that several persons were caught and three were rescued by life lines. Every house in the 20 blocks was flooded and a number of them so badly damaged that they will fall if they are not pulled down. Hundreds of others were damaged so badly that it will be a costly matter to repair them. Ten families were homeless Sunday night because the commissioner of buildings would not let them enter their shaky houses. TRIPLE MURDER AND SUICIDE. Bloody Traicedy Near Freaoll, Mich. —An Ax and a Knife the Weap­ ons Used. Detroit, Mich., Dec. 12.—A special to the Journal from Fresoil, Mich., says: A man named William Hitchings, a brother-in-law of John Hunt, a farmer who lived about two miles west of this place, killed Mr. Hunt, Mrs. Hunt and ineir hired man, Thomas Jdaywaru, Friday afternoon and cut his own throat. Hunt and Hayward were in ths woods cutting wood and Hitchings splitting it, when the latter struck Hunt with his ax, killing him instant­ ly. Hayward started to run, but fell and was struck by Hitchings while ly­ ing on the ground, also killing him in­ stantly. Hitchings then went to the house and killed Mrs. Hunt by stabbing her in the neck with a jackknife. After killing Mrs. Hunt, Hitchings went upstairs and cut his own throat from ear to ear and must have died at once from the way blood is splashed about the room. Generous to the Soldiers. Omaha, Neb., Dec. 12.—The World Herald has sent by telegraph $1,000 to the First Nebraska regiment, located at Manila, and $1,000 to the Third Ne­ braska regiment, commanded by Wil­ liam J. Bryan, now at Savannah, Ga., preparing to start for Cuba. This money is contributed at the solicitation of the World Herald by over 3,000 con­ tributors, and is sent to the two regi­ ments to provide for a Christmas din­ ner. Perish In a Fire. New York, Dec. 12.—After a fierce fire that occurred Sunday in a flat building at 134 Prospect place, Brook­ lyn, four bodies were recovered, and the police expect to find more dead in the ruins. The house was occupied by five families and a boys' club had rooms in the basement. It is supposed the boys accidentally set the place on fire, as the flames were first discovered com­ ing frOm the basement. Resignation Accepted.

London, Dec. 12.—The death is an­ nounced of William Black, the novelist TREATY IS SIGNED. The Peace Commissioners at Paris Finish Their Work. The Final Scene a Memorable One Main Features of the Historical Document—Spanish Government Approves the Protest. Paris, Dec. 12.—The treaty of peace was signed at 8:45 Saturday evening. The treaty as signed consists of 17 ar­ ticles, it having been found advisable to subdivide two or three of the articles in the draft agreed upon at the last meeting. The commissioners of the two nations wrote their signatures on two copies of the treaty, one copy be­ ing for the archives. The document was prepared by Secretary Moore, in behalf of the United States commis­ sioners, and by Senor Villa Rutia for Spain, on account of the continued ill­ ness of Secretary Ojeda. of the Spanish commission. Each copy contains the English and Spanish texts of the treaty in parallel columns. The wording had been approved previously by the com­ missions witnout a joint meeting, so there was no controversy on this sub­ ject. Principal Features. The essential features of the peace treaty are as follows: First—The customary preface of treaties in the nature of an expression of amity and of hope for perpetual peace. Second—The relinquishment by Spain of her sovereignty over Cuba. Third—The withdrawal of all Spanish troops. Fourth—Relinquishment by Spain of sovereignty over Porto Rico. Fifth—Spain's cession of the Philippines Sixth—The withdrawal of the Spanish troops there. Seventh—Payment by the United States of $20,000,000 for the Philippines. Eighth—The provision for the "open door" commercial policy in the Philippines. Ninth—Cable station rights in other Span­ ish colonies. Tenth—Release of Cuban and Philippine political prisoners. Eleventh—Mutual abandoning of all claims for indemnity. Memorable Scene. The signing of the treaty would have afforded a subject for a great historical painting. The group gathered about the table in the stately chamber of the foreign office was impressive in itself, while the sense of the momentous is­ sues which the act decided was deeply felt by all the participants, giving au impressive and solemn tone to the scene. Around the great mahogany table sat the ten arbiters of the des­ tinies of an old arid a young nation. Standing behind them were numerous attaches of the American commission. To the Americans it was a happy end­ ing of the epilogue of war for the Spaniards it was plainly a bitter trag­ edy, none the less painful because long foreseen. They sat silently, as though almost crushed, and none could with­ hold sympathy from Senor Montero Rios, the president of the Spanish com­ mission, who, coming from his bed, was bundled in a great overcoat, though logs were burning in the fire­ place near by. Clone of the Labors. Although the commissioners met at half-past three o'clock, expecting to finish their work in half an hour, the engrossing of the treaty on parchment was found to be so troublesome that it delayed the signing of the document until 8:45. Clerk Martin, of the Amer­ ican commission, worked all day with­ out even stopping to eat. When he came into the chamber at 7:30 with the document he found the commissioners waiting. The Spanish copy had arrived a half hour earlier. Arthur Ferguson then proceeded to read first the English and after that the Spanish version of the treaty. This finished, two copies were passed around the table, the com­ missioners signing them in the order of their rank, as follows: William K. Day, Senator Cushman K. Davis. Sen­ ator William P. Frye, Whitelaw Reid and Senator George Gray Senor Mon­ tero Rios, Senor Abarzuza, Senor Gar nica, Senor Villaurutia and Gen. Cerero Saenz, each commission signing its opponent's treaty. Both were tied with the Spanish and American colors. When the seals were prepared to be affixed attendants were sent scurry­ ing for ribbons of the French tri­ color. with which the documents were sealed as a compliment to the French hosts of the commissions. Many of­ ficials interestedly watched every detail of the proceedings. Spaniards Criticise Americans. The last Beal being impressed,, the commissioners rose and without for­ mality each member shook the hands of all his intagonists and exchanged assurances of sincere personal esteem. The Spaniards afterwards commented acridly upon what they termed the bad taste of the Americans in muster­ ing a crowd of attaches to gloat over the consummation of their downfall and to scramble for relics. The signing was finished at 8:45. At that time the door of the chamber opened and Senor Villaurutia appeared and exclaimed to a group of corre­ spondents who were waiting in the cor­ ridor: "C'est fini!" The other mem­ bers of the Spanish commission fol­ lowed Senor Villaurutia and passed si­ lently through the vestibule to their wai tin carri ages. Th A erican com­ mission strolled out, chatting com­ placently, and as they descended the steps the lights in the chamber were darkened. There has been a great contest among the families and friends of the American commissioners for posses don of the pens with which the sig­ natures to the treaty were written. Some of the Americans were provided with handsome pens purchased for the purpose.

Madrid, Dec. 12.—The government entirely approves the memorandum of protest against the action of the United States commissioners filed by Senor Montero Rios at Paris. The memorandum protests against the refusal of the Americans to surren­ der the securities deposited in the treasuries of Cuba and Porto Rico by private Spaniards, remarking thai "never has a civilized nation commit­ ted such an act of violence." Secondly, it protests against the ulti­ matum demanding the Philippines. Thirdly, it protests against the posi­ tion in which those Spaniards are placed who desire to remain in Cuba. Fourthly, it protests against the ref­ erence to the destruction of the Maine in President McKinley's message to the United States congress. On this point the memorandum says: "Spain has proposed arbitration but the United States refuses to give her the right which is granted to a criminal, namely, the right of defending herself. The Spanish commissioners leave the care of fixing the responsibility for the explosion to the en­ tire world, which will say whether those are responsible who desire the truth or those refusing to seek it."

MINNESOTA NEWS. The board of prison managers, in their biennial report, gave thoroogfc history of the binder twine ImoBas transacted during the past two yesrs^ •ayiog in part: We have increased the capacity of our twine factory from to 5y 000,000 pounds per *.«»«• ««!•»,- adding new machinery of latest improved patters, and making other important dtaofes for the gradual extension and improve­ ment of the plant. We earn say with pardonable pride that we ncpr have one of the best twine plants of its sbe and second to none in the United Ltates. We have made gradual pro­ gress in the quantity and quality at all grades of twine manufactured, and oor product is now generally conceded to be as good as the best twine that can be found on the market. Early the past season the conditions were as usnaL Orders for twine were sent in by dealers and in clubs, after which prices suddenly jumped up. It must be conceded by all fair minded and honest men that to have canceled the orders which had been received would have been a great injustice to honest dealers who could have bought elsewhere at the time orders were placed, at prices but little above the prices finally fixed by the board of managers. The fact that the twine industry has been a success to the state financially and through it a direct benefit to all the taxpayers, and by its competitive effect has held down the prices of other twine sold in the state, ought to be proof that the affairs of the plant have been honestly and faithfully con­ ducted. Was a Sneeesab The beet sugar factory at St. Louis Park has closed its first run and the experiment has proved a complete suc­ cess. The mill ran night and day for seventy-five days, and a daily average of 350 tons of sugar beets were used. About 2,500.000 pounds of sugar were manufactured, and nearly all was sold in the Twin Cities. So great was the demand for the native Minnesota pro­ duct that the managers of the St.Louis Park plant were compe'led to go into the market themselves to fill requisi­ tions from outside points. The farmers who sold beets to the factory received on an average of $4 a ton and are weU satisfied with their part in building up the new industry. One hundred and ten men were em­ ployed by the mill when in operation. Next year the mill will probably run at least 160 days and use 400 tons of beet roots daily. The managers of the plant hope that the farmers will see the advisability of keeping the factory well supplied. The beets raised this year contained a larges quantity of saccharine matter than those of any other state except California. News in Baief. The Brainerd & Northern railroad is completed to Bemidji.
