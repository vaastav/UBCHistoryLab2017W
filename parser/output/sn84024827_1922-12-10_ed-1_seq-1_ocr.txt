CANNOT ACCEPT VIEW Russia Declared to Be Highly Dissatisfied With Ismet on Straits Question ' LAUSANNE, Dec. 9. (By the Asso ciated Press) European delegates who attended the meeting of the sub commissions devoted to discussion of the treatment of foreigners in Turkey and the disposition of the Ottoman debt described the attitude of the Turkish representatives participating therein as recalcitrant. The question at issue before the former subcom mission today was the position of foreign property holders, and two young deputies who recently arrived from Angora adopted an attitude which seemed to augur intransigence when the vital question of foreign ports is to be considered later. No advance was made at the session. At the meeting of the subcommis sion on the Ottoman debt the Turks said they would refuse to accept re-, sponsibility for the entire Turkish debt contracted during the great war and insisted that it should be divided pro rata between Mesopotamia, Syria and . those parts of Greece, Bulgaria and Jugo-Slavta which formerly be longed to Turkey. . ... .- The allies have announced that they cannot accept this view, and a deadlock exists on the question.
