Read it. The message of President Harrison submitted to congress yesterday is a moet important state document. It treats such topics as the Chili outrage and our relations with Italy in a calm and digmhed manner. Matters of a political nature are presented in a way that will please those in political accord with the president. .The Princess Victoria Mary is sweet 24, and Prince Albert Victor is 27. They say the princess isn't particularly pretty, but that 6he possesses all the cardinal virtue, which is ahere she differs from her fiance, who has won distinction by his collars, his cuffs and vulgar vices. Being the eldest son of the Prince of "Wales, he may some day come to the throne, but it will be a sorry day for Great Britain and Ireland when that day comes. John Parxell, brother of the late Charles Stewart Parnell, proposes a settlement of all disputes between the contending parties in the Irish nation il ists ranks. He says: "As the repre sentative of the Parnell family, I will insist that no further quarrel should be kept up over differences, whether wisely or unwisely inaugurated, so that the two factions may come together. I am confident of the place which his tory will give to Charles Stewart Par nell. As the man who set in motion the ball for Irish freedom, his family will insist that his personal affairs are no longer matters of debate. Taking up the platform upota which he led the Irish people to the polls in 1885, we can still unite and stand upon it. I would propose that Kome such man as William O'Brien, holding the confidence of the Irish people, .should be called to the leadership, around whom all should rally. We would then surrender, the Paris fund into the hands of the man thus chosen. I am sure .that this is a reasonable proposition, ; and, coming from our side, it should be readily ac cepted. I regret that so much rancor has been displayed, but that is all past now and our duty is with the future." The New oik papers are .clamoring for the repeal of the electrocution law of that state. Warden Brown says that the latest electrocution under his man agement was a "complete success." If this simply means , that Loppy was killed, says the Advertiser, the warden is warranted in styling the performance a "success." But this success was se cured by meansof no less than six min utes of horrible tortures, which, by the combined accounts, exceed in savagery the most diabolical devices which the worst barbarians of whom all history makes any mention could inflict or in vent. And the most hideous .view of it the one that fairly forces itself upon the public mind before all others is the admission of the experts engaged in the electrocution, that this infliction of keenes agony jand suffering upon a humen being ""is still-"experimentaT!" The amount of voltage necessary to kill the victim is a matter of "experiment." If the first shock is not fatal, there is a respite for the victim; then a second shock, to be followed by a third. Such minor matters as the baking, boiling, blistering of the man are mere incidents in the grand "experiment." Let's reason together. Here's a firm, one of the largest the country over; it has grown, step by step, through the years to greatness and it sells patent medicines ! ugh 1 "That's enough !" Wait a little This firm pays the newspapers good money (expensive work, this adver tising I) to tell the people that they have faith in what they sell, so much faith that if they can't benefit or cure they don't want your money. Their guaran tee is not indefinite and relative, but. definite and absolute if the medicine doesn't help, your money is "on call." Suppose every sick man and every feeble woman tried these medicines and found them worthless, who would be the loser, you or they ? The medicines are Dr Pierce's "Golden Medical Discovery," for blood diseases. and his "Favorite Prescription," for woman's peculiar ills. If they help toward health, they cost $1.00 a bottle each 1 If they don't, they cost nothing I 

MISCELLANEOUS. There are only three words in En glish that end in "ceed." They are ex ceed, proceed, succeed. It is interesting to note that only four English words end in "cion," namely, coercion, epine cion, internecion, suspicion, and only four end in "dous," to wit, hazardous, jeopardous, stupendous, tremendous. A happy family dwells in an engine house in Madison, Indiana, and the an tics of the members afford amusement to the fire company. The family is composed of a coon, a cat, a pair of rab bits, two white mica and a shepherd dog. They occupy the same apartment, sport tog-ether and eat from the same vessel. ' George AU Right "When George asked you to be his wife," inquired the mother, "wasn't he a good deal flustered and confused? "Yes mama," "replied Laura, looking admiringly at something that sparkled on her shapely finger, "but what he said had the right ring about it." Chicago Tribune. The Hawaiian islands were dis covered by Gaetano, a Spanish navigator, in 154-2. The independence of these islands was recognized by the United States in 1829, and more formally in 1843; by Belgium in 1844, and by En gland and France later in the same year. G orb am Gray, inventor of a kind of wire by which the conductivity is in the core instead of on the surface of the wire, says he is convinced that tele phony is practicable not only between this country and Europe, through the Atlantic ocean, but for 9,000 miles from New York through to San Francisco and Hawaii. Hello, there! An Equivocal Puff. "'Did you see the notice I gave you?" said the editor to the grocer. "Yes, and I don't want another. The man who says I've got plenty of sand, that the milk I sell is of the first water, and that my butter is the strongest in the market, may mean well, but he is not the man I want to flatter me a second time." Secretary Blaine is very proud of the success achieved by his eldest son, Emmons, who has just been appointed assistant to the president of the Balti more & Ohio railroad, with general charge of the western department of the road. Secretary Blaine has never recovered from the shock of his son Walker's death, but his pride now cen ters in his eldest son. Hotter Than Azure Blood Pater "So you don't like Mr. Fahrweste?" Daughter "I don't He's too coarse. I don't believe there's a drop of blue blood in his veins." Pater "Never you mind that. He's a mine owner, and the contents of his veins are ores that as say twenty thousand to the ton." Daughter "I'll wed him." Pittsburgh Bulletin. A Worldly Mite. Sick Child "Mamma, do folks that die and go to Heaven wear white robes and crowns, and have harps to play on when they want to?' Mamma "Yes, dear." Sick Child "And do they have bicycles to ride and sponge cake to eat?" Mamma "No." Sick Child "Then I guess you can bring me that medicine I didn't want to take." Pharmaceutical Era. A strange story comes from Bruns wick, Me. A worthy citizen of that town was breaking ice, preparatory to making some ice water. In the middle of the square of ice he discov ered a dark-brown substance. Cutting. closer to this object, he saw that it was a toad. While the gentleman was gaz ing in amazement, at it, the toad, which at first seemed lifeless, recovered ani mation, and leisurely hopped away. It is evident that there was no con troversy about the source of the Mis sissippi when the treaty of 1783 con firming the independence of the United States was signed. It was stipulated in that treaty that the boundary between the two countries should run from the northwest corner of the Lake of the Woods due west to the source of the Mississippi. It was not discovered for many years later that the sources of the Mississippi are far south. Hundreds' of mistakes creep into maps through misinformation given by savage or semi-civilized people, or the misunderstanding of explorers. Here is one instance: A conspicuous place, the capital of the Laos country, east of Burmah, has been known for many years as Zirame, and the name has ap peared in large letters on the maps. The real name of this place is Chineg Mai. The Burmese can not prc-nonnce this name, and the name introduced on our maps is their mispronunciation of it One of the most successful practical Inventions recently perfected in Dres den is a knitting machine which can be employed on all varieties of fancy work as well as on round and flat work, capable of producing1 colored, striped and vari-colored patterns without ihanginpr the machine. It knits Cardi gan stitch, pearl-Cardigan and two-and-two rib. For durability, however, no machine has ever taken the place of the knitting needle. Mr. Theodore Bent who was sent to investigate the famous Zimbabye ruins in South Africa, writes home that these ruins are undoubtedly of Phoeni cian origin, and that the inscriptions and other evidence he has found un mistakably indicate the form of wor ship, the manner of decoration, and the system of gold smelting practiced by the vanished people who erected the structures. They are relics of a people who were far advanced in civilization, though the present inhabitants are mere savages. A distinguished foreign physician, paying a visit to the Berlin Medical In stitute, found Prof. Brieger busily at work in the laboratory, surrounded by a most formidable array of chemical and bacteriological utensils. The pro fessors sole attention and care, how ever, appeared concentrated on one par ticular vessel, which was enveloped by smoke and steam. "Guess what I am boiling here," said the professor to the visitor. The latter began to enumerate the entire scale of micro-organisms. "Micrococci?" "No." "Gonococci?" "No." "Spirochetal" "No." "What then?" "Hot sausages," replied Brie ger. This cut illustrates the Normal focus on the retina. THE 

UPSON JEWELRY CO, and CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS. Mr. Stillar'e BMolatloi on Committer Chairmanship Adjournment. Washington, Deo. 10. After Mm read.g of the President's Message, Mr. Hoi man, of Indiana, moved that the House adjourn until Saturday, with the understanding that lc should adjourn on that day without doing any business until after Wednesday. Pending a vote on Mr. Holman's mo tion, Mr. Miller, of Wisconsin (Dam.), submitted a resolution requesting th Speaker to apportion the committees of the House among the several States ac cording to populatiou, and that each State receive at least one chairmanship. The resolution caused a buzz, and Mr. Milliken, of Maine (Rep.), called out: "I think the Speaker should not be em barrassed in this way. We have confi dence in his ability to select his commit tees." Before a discussion could take place, Mr. Breckenridge, of Kentucky, moved the reference of the resolution to the Committee on Rules, and this was done. The House then adjourned until Sat urday. The Senate adjourned until to-day im mediately after the reading of the mes sage. House Committees. Washington, Dec. 9. Some of the prominent Democratic members of the House are urging Speaker Crisp to appoint the committees before the holi day recess, but there appears to be con siderable doubt as to whether this work can be accomplished in so short a time. Mills May Withdraw. Washington, Dec. 10 The report it current here that Congressman Mills contemplates withdrawing from the House to enter on a compaign for the Senatorship. Iutclifa County Election Case. Poughkeepsie, N. Y., Dec. 10. The Dutchess County Canvassing Board yes terday counted the votes for Senator, in accordance with the order of Judge Barnard. This gave Osborne a major ity of 130 in the county, and gives the district to Gilbert A. Deans by a major ity of 40. Immediately after the cer tificate of result was filed, on the order of the County Clerk a mandamus from Judge Barnard was served upon the board, ordering them to show cause why the marked ballots returned by the different inspectors, and questioned by others, should not be declared.null and void. E. B. Osborne is the relator, and the writ is returnable before Judge Barnard on Saturday next at 10 o'clocs. Suuol Sa-iti t be Umt, Stockton, Cal., Dae 10. The state ment is published here that Sunol, the trotter, is crippled and there is little hope of a cure being effected. The mare went lame after her recent feat of breaking the record, and despite the best known treatment no relief was reached. Expert horsemen here think a ligament was strained, in which event Sunol will be lame permanently. Charles Marvin is reported to have said that the lameness was caused by a blis ter, and that the mare may recover, but is apt to go lame again after fast work. Haitian Denial the Cliarga. San Francisco, Dae. 10. Ned Han lan, the oarsman, has requested an in vestigation of the chargas that he pur posely lost his race, with McLean last Sunday, and President Sullivan of the Pacific Rowing Association has accord ingly called a meeting of the association for to-night. Hanlan attributes his de feat to a lack of condition and sud lea nausea and deelares that, in view of the charges, he will decline the match with Henry Patterson.
