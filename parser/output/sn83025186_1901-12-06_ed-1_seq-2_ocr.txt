'jW'V f-v v,:v i. :a Iowa State Bystander* BVSTANDBB FCU. CO. SK J. IOWA DES MOINES, NOTES FROM THE CAPITAL Governor Bhaw is in receipt of A) letter from ex-Governor Francis, \E^president of the Louisiana' Purchase exposition, suggesting that December 2D be observed as Iotiisiana Purchase Flag day. This is the anniversary of the actual transfer of title by France to the United States. Gov ernor Shaw is in hearty sympathy with the movement, and requests that the American flag be displayed frpm all public buildings, state, coun ty and municipal, in honor of this historic evernt, which has proven to be of such value to the world as well as to the nation. In the forthcoming biennial report of the state superintendent of pub lie instruction there will be an em phatic endorsement of the present system of free text books, which has been adopted in a number of counties in Iowa. The state superintendent, while acknowledging that there has been some criticism of the methods employed in some counties by the firms seeking to secure the adoption of books, says the practical work ings of the law have been satisfac tory. As an argument against any change in the present law, the su perintendent cites the fact that dur ing the present year between forty and fifty counties have adopted or re adopted a uniform series of booKS for a period of five years, and any changes in the law would greatly em barrass these communities. On recommendation of the city physician, Dr. N. .Rchiltz, the city council has taken action looking to t.he ordering of general vaccination in the city. A communication of Dr. Schiltz was referred to the city so licitor with instructions to prepare a communication addressed to the local board of instruction and to pre pare another communication ad dressed to employers of labor in the city, and especially to proprietors of large.stores and factories. Governor Shaw has offered a re ward of $150 for the apprehension of the slayer of Samuel Crafton, the colored preacher found dead in a corn field near Ireton the middle of last October. An appeal case which will test the features of the Iowa code which was designed to circumvent the original package theory ot the courts with regard to interstate commerce, .will come on for admission at the next term of the Iowa supreme court. In the Iowa code it was sought to pre vent the sending into the state of liquor in original packages by mak ing it a crime to solicit orders for liquor to be shipped into the state. On behalf of this feature of the law it is claimed that, the solicitation of orders is an act entirely within -the state and entirfly separate from the act of making the sale and ship ment in another state. A number of cases have been tried in the dis trict courts involving the construc tion of this law. some decided one way and some another, but a test ease has been made of one from Jef ferson county in which one Hanaphy was fined for taking orders for an Illinois liouor house. Judge Eichel berger decided that the law is con stitutional, and the convicted per son appeals. The papers have just been finished in the case. The de fault relies on the well known prin ciple of non-interference with inter state commerce. The supreme court has not passed on the question as applied to this statute. The case is of great importance as involving one feature of the Iowa prohibitory liq or law. State Auditor Merriam in his forth coming biennial report makes a rec ommendation for the establishment of an insurance department. This recommendation is one of the most important features of the report. An insurance commissioner, with pow ers similar to those conferred on like officers in other states, is recom mended, in view of the fact that the auditor's office as now constituted is overburdened. The collection of Chinese arms of warfare presented by Major E. H. Conger to Kinsman post of this city recently, has been removed to the state historical department. Kinsman post has loaned the collection to the state museum, with the intention of donat ing it permanently to the state. 

QUKISJ* FORGIVES HENRY. Efforts to Gloss Over Trouble in Holland's ltoj-al tamlly. Amsterdam. Dec. 6.—In view, of allaying public indignatir and ex citement semi-official intimations have been crculated to the effect that Queen Wilhelmina has forgiven hor liusband, Prince Henry of the Nether lands, the sugestion being that the public ought to follow suit. Sizice Prince Henry returned to Het Loo the queen and he have been dining together and gradually resum ing normal relations. Yesterday they walked together and afterward drove in the castle park. The relations be tween Prince Henry and the members of the court are however, very strain ed. The former cordiality has been replaced by an attitude of frigid polite ness on the part of the prince consort, and apparently the gentlemen of the court are equally indisposed to gloss over recent occurrences. Cabinet IK Satisfied. Washington, Dec. 4.—The cabinet meeting yesterday was principally consumed in a discussion of the insular decisions handed down yester day by the supreme court. On the whole, it is believed, the views of the majority of the court were quite satisfactory to the administration. It was pointed out that the ultimate re sults of the decisions are in a mca3' ure speculative at present with the exception that the customs duties will fcave to be refunded. THE 

NEWS IN IOWA TWO KOBBKIW MUST DIE. Found Guilty of the Murder of Marshal UtdiM or Greenville. Storm Lake, Dec. 6.—A sure ven geance 'was meted cut late yesterday afternoon to Albert Phillips and Lewis Brooks, the two bank robbers who killed John Sunblad while escaping from their Greenville bank raid. Af ter a day's deliberation the jury in their cases declared Uiese two men guilty of murder in the first degree and condemned both of them to death by hanging. Neither Phillips nor Brooks mani fested as much excitement over the vedict when it was announced as the hundreds of spectators who had crowded into the court room. They were unmoved and merely looked sig nificantly at each other aB they sat together in the prison box. They will probably be taken to the Anampsa prison to await their penalty as soon as sentence is passed. These two men raided the Greenville bank about three weeks ago. They were discovered near Albert City soon after and a running fight followed, in which Sunblad and a constable were badly wounded, both dying later. Brooks is a white man and Phillips a negro. Neither has given any clue to his identity. STA KCU TVOKKI BURNED.

Des Moines, Dec. 5.—Miss Lilian Pederson, who lives at 1408 Maple street, has been taken ill with the smallpox and is quarantined. Her sister, Miss Laura, is one of the stenographers in the state board of control and undoubtedly has been exposed to the infection and in dan ger of taking the smallpox. As soon as this was discovered there was consternation in the office of the board of control and elsewhere, in the state capitol, and Dr. Kennedy, secre tary of the state board of health, was called on to vaccinate all who had not before been vaccinated. The room*, of the state board of control were fumigated and every precau tion taken to prevent any spread •of the disease from that source. It is confidently believed that no danger exists of a spread elsewhere in the state house. Failor Murder Trial Is On.

QUARTER OF MILLION Capitol Improvement Commission /lakes Its Report. Iowa City, Dec. 4.—A highly im portant report has been sent from Iowa City to Governor Shaw. The report recommends an appropriation of almost a quarter of a million doU lars for rjpairing and beautifying °1 the capitol at Des Moines. It was written by the^three commissioners, empowered by act of the Twenty eighth general assembly to pursue "investigation as to the repairs and improvements needed upon the in terior and exterior of the capitol building and the property of the state connected therewith." The mem bers of the commission are, Hon. Peter A. Dey, of Iowa -City, who for about sixteen years was connected with the building of thie capitol H. 8k Josselyn of Cedar Rapids, an chitect who has a state reputation, and Charles A. Cumming, the head of the art school at Des Moines. To use the exact figures, the commis sioners recommend the appropria tion, in all, of $232,950 for the pur pose noted above. They state in their report the fol lowing: "We have aimed to make the estimate large enough to cover any and all contingencies, and while in the aggregate the amount is large we feel confident that it will be money well expended." The estimate referred to in the quotation just noted are as follows: Corriders, halls and rotunda—-Six mosaics in the arcade, $10,000 paint ing in large panel, $10,000 walls, lob bies, arches, etc., around the grand stairway and corriders, $15,000 ro tundas and walls, $25,000 pictorial objects for semi-circle spaces, $8,000 painting and decorating library, basement, etc.. $10,000 total. $78,(C0. Elevators. $8,500 electric lighting, dynamos, etc., $50,100 burglar alarm, telephone system, etc., $2,500 roof repairs, $13,250 furniture, $4,000 re pairs of walls, $7,000 painting and regilding main domes, $14,900 heat ing, ventilation and plumbing, $27, 300 boiler house repairs, etc., $3,300 fire proof ware house for documents, $14,000 contingencies and supervis ion, $10,000: grand total, $252,050. The commissioners declare that "during the fifteen years that passed since the building went out of the control of the capitol commissioners little had been done in the way of thorough and radical repair, and we reached the conclusion that a much larger expenditure of money was needed than had been anticipated to place the capitol building in a state of perfect repair." SHOT ltY SOCIK1V VODJiG'LADY. Alias Margaret Kunlz«o( Hasting Shoots K. L. Wilson. Hastings, Dec. 5.—Hastings was stirred to its limit by the report that 11. L. Wils-m. th^ lii^'it iter ator at the Burlington station, hud been shot by Miss Margaret Knnr/e, ore of the best known and most pop ular young ladies of the lown. It seems that Wilson had left, a bowl ing alley to go to work when Mi'-ss Ivuntze stepped from an alley near her mother's home and shot him in the back with a 32 ealibre revolver. The heavy overcoat worn by Wilson saved his' life, for the shot took ef fect. in the back of his shoulder, aT.d had it been but a few inches iDwer would have resulted fatally. No cause is known for the shooting. Wilson's father .came and took the voung man to his home at Thayer. Wilsuw is not seriously injured. BURLINGTON F1B1! liUGS. Insurance Companies Hasten to Cancel lieir Risks. Burlington, Dec. 5.—The four mys terious fires at the big Farmer wood working mills north of the city have so alarmed the local and foreign in surance agents that nearly all of the risks have been cancelled. The fires occurred Friday and Saturday morn ing last, and were in various parts of the buildings. The circumstances point unquestionably to incendiarism. There was a total* of $77,000 insur ance on the plant, over $50,000 of which was placed by Burlington agents, the remainder being chiefly through Chicago insurance brokers The loss by the recent fires wil amount to about 10 per cent. The mills are among the largest on the Mississippi river. Cliili ar­ lv.lled Ills Brother. Boone, Dec. 5.—Word reached this city of a fatal accident that occurred near Mackay. Little Andrew Ahrens the 5-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Ahrens, shot and instantlv killed his brother Eddie. Eddie was but one. year older than his broth er, and the two boys had been sent by their mother on some errand to the home of her sister-in-law, Mrs Mart Ahrens. The lads arrived at the house, and after delivering their message, Andrew, while lookinp around the room, saw a rifle stand ing behind the door and took it uj and raised it to his shoulder as i' to shoot. lTis aunt saw him am" cried out for him to put it down, but 'before she had finished the little fe' low had pulled the trigger. The ball entered the neck of his brother, passing through tb« body, killing him instantly. Farmer Seriously Hart.

Des Moines, Nov. 30.—Charles Mein ky of Fontanelle, a juror in the Bal liett mining ease now on trial in the United States district court, was found dead in his room in the Graefc house. It was evident that he blew out the gas before retiring and was asphyxiated. His death will not in terfere with the trial, and the case will proceed with eleven jurors to day.

HEWS IN GENERAL 1 &"•' vw PANACEA FOR 1'AN ICS. Seeretitry Osf« Submit® Pima In It is An nual Report. Washington, Dec. 5.—Secretary of the Treasury Gage yesterday submit ted his annual report to the speaker of the house of' representatives It is notable fp« the fact that he recom mends the repeal of all war taxes, an important change in the banking system and the payment of shix bountie=. Concerning the latter he shows that while the exports from America are increasing and the commerce expand ing, but a small fraction is carried in American vessels and that in many cases large investments of- American capital are made in vessels flying foreign flags because of the favors shown shipping by other countries. The secretary urges tha^ bounties be immediately offered for American vessels and suggests that the best means of applying it would be in the way of big mail contracts. Concerning the reduction of rev enue, the secretary says the receipts are in excess of disbursements at an increasing rate and that at least $50,000,000 annually could be easily dispensed- with. As a first step, he advocates the repeal of the remainder of the war taxes entirely. On the subject of banking, he says that while our system is an admira ble one during prosperous times, it has been demonstrated a miserable failure in times of financial distress. He says the panic of 1893 could have been averted by a proper sys tem. A large central bank with multipled branches is suggested by him as the ideal arrangement but he admits thsi would never meet with popular approval. As the next best and a very acceptable substitute, he recommends that the principle of federation be applied to banks, with one general system of officers or managers at the bead. He explains that this would prevent panics. The secretary shows that the gov ernment finances were never before in such excellent condition nor so large a surplus in the treasury. The gold reserve has been maintained and he says the crold standard must be preserved. He advocates more paper money as a necessity to in creased population. BRITISH. ON TH# MESSAGE. The London Papers Generally Give It Their Approval. London, Dec. 4.—The London daily papers this morning, looking at Presi dent Roosevelt's message from the point of view of its literary power and the wealth of weighty matters discussed, regard it as one of the most characteristic and remarkable messages ever sent to congress. At the same time the papers recognize its conservative and business-like moderation and that no attempt has been made, as the Morning Post re marks, "to strike an attitude or car ry his listeners away.' On the whole, however, the news papers are skeptical of any great out come from the president's efforts in the direction of reform of the trusts, anti-anarchism or reciprocity, the idea being that the senate will eventu ally step in and prevent any great changes in the existing system. Most of the papers remark upon the tone of exultation adopted by President Roosevelt in dealing with the canal question, but they do not show the slightest disposition to cavil thereat. 

HUSBAND OF WILHELMINA IN DUEL Is Said That He Insulted the Queen and Resented Interference. Amsterdam, Dec. 5.—In spite of of ficial denials, investigations show there is substantial foundation for the story of a duel having been fought between Prince Henry of the Netherlands, husband of Queen Wil helmina, and Major Van Tets, the queen's aide de campe. It appears that at a dinner at Het Loo, her majesty was hurt by some inattention on the part of the prince and spoke to him sharply. Prince Henry retorted offensively, where upon Major "Van Tets made a re mark regarding the., impropriety of the prince consort's conduct. A quar rel followed between the aide de campe and the prince, who had been drinking freely, and a duel with swords was fought after dinner. Van Tets was wounded. He has since been removed to Utrecht to be operated upon. The same incident gave rise to an other duel between Prince Henry and a gentleman of the court. The lat ter was slightly woundod._, CHAFFEE ADOPTS EXTREMES. Ports in Lngana and Batangns Provinces Are Closed. Manila, Dec. 6.—General Chaffee uas issued orders for the closing of all ports in the Laguna and Bat ngas provinces. The quartermasters there will cease paying rents to the Fili pinos for the buildings used for mili tary purposes, as it is known that a large proportion of the money finds its way to the insurgents in tne shape of contribution and General Chaffee in tends that no more government funds shall nnd their way into the hands of the enemy. The reason for closing the ports is that too many supplies are found to be getting into the possession of the insurgents. General Chaffee intends giving Gen eral Bell, commanding the troops in Batangas province, every assistance he may require to subdue the in surrection. Governor Taft is improving rapidly ana now expects to return to the United States on the government transport Grant, which sails before Christmas. -Taft Gets Leave of Ahsence.

Governor Taft is to leave for the United States on the first transport available.

Washington, Dec. 5.—Senator Hoar has introduced a Vill for the pro tection of the president, which pro vides as follows: "That any person who shall within the limits of the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, willfully kill- or cause the death of the president of the United States or any officer thereof, or shall willfully kill or cause the death of the ruler, or chief magistrate, of any foreign country, shall be pun ished with death. "That any person who shall with in the limits of the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, make an attempt on the life of the president of the United States, or any officer thereof or who shall make an attempt on the life of the ruler, or chief magistrate, of^ any foreign country, shall be punished with death. "That any person who shall within the limits of the United States oi any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, advise the killing of the president of the United States, or any officer thereof, or shall conspire to accomplish the same or who shall advise or counsel the killing of the ruler, or the chief magistrate, of any foreign country, or who shall con spire to accomplish the same, shall be punished by imprisonment not ex ceeding twenty years. "That any person who has con spired as aforesaid may be indicted' and convicted separately although the other party or parties to the con spiracy are not indicted or convict ed. "That any person who shall will fully and knowingly aid in the es cape from punishment of any person guilty of either of the acts mentioned in the foregoing sections shall be deemed an accomplice after the fact, and shall be punished as if a prin cipal, although the other party ox parties to said offense shall not be indicted or convicted." 

CHECK TO PROSECUTION. Further Belay in the Trial of the Neeley Postal Fraud Case. Washington, Dec. 6.—The prosecu tion in the case of Charles Neely, charged with postal frauds in Cuba, has met with a check which may cause delay in the trial of this case. It appears that the prosecution is of necessity relying largely upon letters setting out testimony taken in the United States. Such depositions may be used according to the Spanish prac tice. But the question has been raised and has been discussed by the cabinet if such a proceeding is lawful under the statute by means of which the extradition of Neely to Cuba was secured. The extradition laws are held by Neely's friends and counsel to demand for the accused the oppor tunity to be confronted with witnesses aginst himself, or have full opportuni ty to cross-examine on depositions, as he should have under the American legal practices. To admit this point would be to greatly endanger the suc cess of the prosecution, in the opinion of the officials here, but so far no de cision has been reached. AGAINST ADMIRAL SCHLEY. Court of Inquiry Said to Have JJecided lie -Was in Error. New York, Dec. 6.—A special to the Ft ess from Washington says: Rear Admiral Schley has been found at fault on five counts by the court of inquiry. This comes from a person who is in a position to learn the opin ion of the three admirals on the dif ferent specifications of the precept. It is understood, however, that the court finds Schley: "First—For the delay of the Flying Squadron off Cienfuegos. "Second—For misrepresentation of the reasons for returning to Key West to coal. "Third—For disobedience of orders in making the retrograde movement. "Fourth—For failure to destroy the Colon. "Fifth—For conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman in the Schley Hodgson controversy." It is impossiole for the Associated Press to confirm the report of the Press' statements in regard to the finding of the Schley court tonight. Bulgaria's Reply Is Impudent. New York, Dec. 4.—The Bulgarian government's reply to United States Diplomatic Agent Dickinson's note has just been made public by the Austro-Hungarian foreign ministry at Vienna, says the Vienna corres pondent of the World. It was written by Mr. Daniff, min ister of foreign affairs and concludes with the following words: "I am sur prised that you have come to the conclusion that the United States will hold Bulgaria responsible for Miss Stone's death. I must regard it as certain that the using of violence by the brigands can only be laid to your delay. "The Bulgarian government de clines all responsibility." Tn Vienna this answer is considered most impudent, and the hope is ex pressed that the United States will hold Bulgaria responsible for Miss ^stone's safety. Boys .Accused of Forgery. Clinton, Dec. 3.—Two young boys, aged 13 and 15, living west of Low Moor, were arrested, charged with attempting to pass forged checks. They offered the checks to William Porter and tried to pass others upon prominent farmers. One was offered to Chas. Wenzel and the forgery was detected. It is claimed the boys drew up the checks and made them look like originals of the signatures used. Numbers of men like to lean on other men. (iovernor of Oklahoma to be Ousted.
