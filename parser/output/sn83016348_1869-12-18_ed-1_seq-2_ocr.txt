m* ; IXKTOA. DECEMBER IS. 1569. “Let Him Alone.” , “ C,” as if ashamed of the manly senti ments expressed in The Democrat some three weeks since, in favor of educating , tlie colored people, and which we com mended as wise and liberal above his Je shuitieal party, retracts, iu a measure, by attempting to qualify and explain his rea sons for tlie noble utterance. Ho says, “ Let him alone, Democrat—tho negro be longs to us.” Here is the fog in which the Democracy arc bewildered. They cannot comprehend the negro, except as property. In fifteen States he was so long classed as a chattel —a peculiar property having a representative value iu Congress, which was appropriated exclusively hy the Democ racy, that it is not surprising its loss is felt to ho a great deprivation. Nevertheless, the fact has got through tho hair, finally, that they own him no longer ; but another equally important truth, that tho negro is a free man, and in the language of our Declaration of Independence, entitled to “life, liberty, and tlie pursuit of happi ness," does not yet seem to be fully com prehended, even hy tlie most advanced members of that party. Hence “C.” puts tho following language into tlie mouth of The Whig —“the negro belongs to us, — and wc are abundantly able to take care of him.” AVe don’t propose, however, that the Re publican party, as “ C.” intimates, shall take care of tho colored man, hut believe him “ abundantly able to take care ” of , himself, and “ say let him alone,” as wc , let every other man alone who has a white skin; according to all alike the political rights and privileges promised in the Decla ration of Independence, as “self-evident" truths and “ unalienable rights," to secure ; which “ governments are instituted among men.” AA’e are charged with making the negro our “main stock in trade ever since father Abraham sent forth his hull of i emancipation.” It would boa satisfaction to know what has been the stock in trade of the Democracy, not only since the ap- i pcaraneo of father Abraham's bull, which i gored the rebellion, and its parent, Democ- i racy, to death, but long anterior to that i event, if it lias not been the negro? Has that party, for tlie last twenty-five years, i made a political canvass, the most promi- i neut issues of which did not embrace the i “ negro question ?” and for the last eight i years little else has been written about ar i talked of by that party, but the negro ? He was proclaimed the corner-stone of their i proposed new government in the revolting i States. And now, at this very hour, why i do the whole party cling to the hope, like drowning men to straws, that the Fifteenth . Amendment will be defeated, if their po litical salvation did not rest entirely on keeping the colored man in a state of serf dom ? AVe do not say, let him alone iu Ids ignorance, but let him alone to enjoy the i lilierty which is his “ unalienable right;” and educate his children that they may be wiser and better men, than that debris from Europe which has long been used to fill up the ranks of tie Democratic party, as they become depleted hy education. It has long been a favorite theme with tho apostles of Democracy to decry the ig norance of the negro, and “C.” in his last article, imitates this bad example.— He is not storked with book lore, we admit, but there are other standards of intelli gence than the A, B, C criterion. His his tory, for eight years, has proven him, to tlie prejudice of his traducers, to be far above the brutes, as this charming Demo cratic party constantly picture him. The leaders of the rebellion found they could not impose upon him, or deceive him, when bis freedom was at stake. Since then they have hob-nobbed with him, or attempted it, to gain his vote : but he has proved too intelligent to be duped by bis former masters. His knowledge of politi cal affairs, has made the negro proof against both flattery and persecution, and when not overpowered by force, lias steadily voted against the men who held him in slavery, and now seek to withhold the ballot from him. Ho has steadily and consistently voted just as tho most intelligent white men would have voted if placed in similar ' circumstances. The Democracy have tried, hut their success lias not been flattering, 1 to impose upon the negro with lies. Why ■ then does “ C.” say “wo can make him ; believe any lie we choose ?” AA'o agree, however, most heartily, with 1 “ C,” in urging upon tlie State tho duty of educating the colored race, the rising gen eration of whom are more exposed to temp tation and vices than ever before. Every child should be properly educated without regard to color. Society reaps a hundred fold hy it. If educated, and tho conflict of color and race still maintains its hold on the future generations, as an educated peo ple they can separate. Tlie world is wide. The educated colored man can carry the civilisation and arts of the Anglo Saxon to the untamed continent of his fathers. He never can do it as an inferior, or ignorant man. Report of tlie Postmaster-General. The first Report of Postmaster-General freswell is conceded hy tlie press of tlie country generally, to bo one of the ablest ever coming from the Post-Office Depart ment. Tlie firm stand taken by Mr. Cres wcli to reform the abuse of tlie franking privilege meets with universal approval; and the remedy suggested to diffuse infor mation among the people, of Government affairs, which is now supposed to be accom plished by distributing Public Documents free, is eminently wise and practical. In lieu of tlie franking privilege, which is possessed by upwards of thirty thousand Government officers at an estimated ex pease of $1,000,000 annually to the Depart ment, the Postmaster-General suggests that newspapers be sent free to boifide subscri bers from offices of publication. By the means of free newspapers vastly more in formation would be spread among the peo ple than is at present covered hy official franks. The amount of revenue derived from postage on newspapers is $77,883, which is proposed to bo given up in order to stop tlie immense frauds growing out of the franking privilege. AVhen the Post- Office, is relieved of this incubus, which is increasing yearly in weight, then a further reduction of letter postage, it is probable will bo found practicable, which cau never , be hoped for while the present abuse of the franking privileges continues. A Christmas or New Year's Present. —A monthly or weekly publication for young people makes one of tlie most ac ceptable presents that can lie given during the holidays—and for fids purpose the Youth’t Cotnpanion, of Boston, is admira bly adapted. It will make its appearance new and fresh with each succeeding week, is always sprightly, entertaining and prac tical. Some of tho most brilliant writers in the country contribute to its columns. wm VW~ We publish on our first page tins week a very readable Utter from the coal , regions of Pennsylvania, written by a former citizen of Ceell, which will interest every ( reader of The Whig. AVo hope the same gentleman who wields such a facile pen, ( will not “weary of well doing,” but let the ( readers of The Whig bear from Tamaqua often. Gold is down to 121 j in New Y’ork. ' What Has Hr come ol American Commerce 5 Tills question is suggested by the intima tion contained by the Free Trade article of I The Democrat of Saturday last, whore it is ’ charged by implication that the present 1 tariff is the cause of the present state of American commerce. The writer says : “Our commerce is languishing, our mer- 1 chant licet rotting in the docks. The : American merchant ships were once the i pride of our country, and their sails win- , tuned every sea, now the gallant sailor seeks another dag, whilst the moth is eating his own bunting. The Committee on Commerce, appointed to investigate and report the cause of this 1 deplorable calamity, have recently made 1 public the facts of their investigation, which 1 wore not that import duties on foreign 1 goods had driven it from the seas, but the ' British built and manned rebel corsairs, ' which under the encouragement and assist- I ance of the aristocratic government of Eng land, were protected in their piracy on the i high seas, in capturing and burning de fenceless merchantmen, sailing under the United States flag. 1 It was not the numbers of ships wan- ' touly burned and destroyed by this pirati- 1 cal arrangement between the old enemy of American commerce and the Rebel Confcd oraoy ; but witli such freebooters as the : Alabama roving the seas, merchants who I shipped in American bottoms were unable 1 to procure insurance, without paying such i enormous rates as would sink the entire i profits of the cargo. And the consequence I was that American vessels, to escape the danger of being pounced upon in mid-ocean, by these pirates, were transferred to British 1 protection, took out British papers and sail- 1 cd under the British flag. The American 1 commerce, which had been building up for ] the greater part of a centuary, was hy this 1 foul alliance between the rebel leaders, and the natural enemy of that commerce, driven 1 from the seas in four years. A commerce 1 like that of the United States before tbo < war, cannot be re-established in a day or a ] year. Another cause reported by the Com- 1 mittce is the high wages demanded by 1 American sailors above those of the British ' marines, serving at present to keep the | freights of British vessels below those of American shippers. These are the jirinie i causes of the present state of our com merce, clearly attributable to the madness that ruled in the southern half of our conn- ] try in 1800, and not the present tariff.— ’ And if the tariff on imports is high, it is i the result of the debt caused by the self- 1 same war, which was the ruin of our com merce, all brought about in tbo effort to 1 establish a dominion wboly dedicated to i slavery. This much we have thought it necessary to say in reference to the decline of our . merchant marine, in taking leave of the '■ editor pro tem. who during his brief instal- I ment in the editorial chair of The Democrat, ' gave his readers plain, honest thoughts in i strong Saxou words, in lieu of the hazy, < labyrinthian rhetoric, on which they have been refreshed so long. : His theory of paying the public debt by < direct taxation, wc fear would not find i many friends among the farmers ; and those ' few would rapidly diminish after the first : levy. To advocate paying our immense puhlie debt hy direct taxation, is only a I mild name for repudiation. It could not be done. i 

CONGRESSIONAL. The United States Senate was notin ses- ] f ion on Saturday. In the House of Roprc- ] sentatives a debate arose upon a motion to j lay on tbo table Mr. Ingcrsull’s bill to au- i tborize the issue of forty-fourrailliou dollars i of legal tenders, the Secretary of the ' Treasury to purchase with them and cancel gold interest bearing bonds. The motion to lay the bill on the table failed by a vote of 01 to 88. The bill was referred to the : committee on Banking and Currency. A , resolution was adopted, requesting the i Committee on AVays and Moans to report a bill repealing the manufacturers’ tax on provisions, and so explain the present law as to relieve dealers from the interpretation . placed upon it by the Commissioner of In- , temal Revenue. The Census bill was dis cussed, but no important changes made. In the United States Senate, on Monday, Mr. Carpenter, from the Committee on the Judiciary, reported a hill to perfect the re construction of Georgia, providing for the assembling of the Legislature as originally elected, with no expulsion of members on account of race or color, the exclusion of all persons ineligible under the the Four teenth Amendment, and that the provisions of the act be enforced by the military and naval power. The bill was laid over for the present. Mr. Drake called up bis bill prohibiting the Supremo Court from jurisdiction upon acts of Congress, and made an argument upon it. Mr. Drake took the ground that 1 if the Court could pass judgement upon and reverse an act of Congress it was prac tically the highest power in the land, and 1 that the Constitution never intended but 1 that Congress should be the sole and su- ' preme legislative power. In the House of Representatives Mr. Butler introduced several bills for the ad mission of Virginia, all of which were re ferred to the Committee on Reconstruction. Several bills to abolish the franking privi lege were referred. A message from the Secretary of State i was received announcing that official no- I tieo of the ratification of the Fifteenth : Amendment had been received from twen- i ty-ono States. The Census hill was then i debated on the representation question up : to the hour of adjournment. The House : agreed to adjourn for the holidays from De- I cember 22d to January Ith. • On Tuesday, the session of the Senate was devoted to tho official announcement of the death of Senator Fessenden. ' Much of the time of the House was also 1 taken up with tho same subject. 1 Mr. Getz, of Pennsylvania, introduced a 1 resolution directing the Committee on AA'ays ' and Means to inquire into the expediency 1 of abolishing the office of Collector, As- 1 sessor and other agents of tho Internal Revenue Bureau, and apportioning the amount of taxes among the several States , to be collected by them. Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. In the Senate, on AVcdnosday, ajmomor- j ial from the National Colored Labor Con vention, recently in session at AVasbingtoii, i setting forth the necessity of Congress in- ( terfering to ameliorate tho condition j of the laboring men of the South, and asking Congress to divide the lands i belonging to the Government in the South i among tho colored men, was referred to , Committee on Public Lands. Senator i Brownlow had read by tho Secretary a statement relative to bis course in Tonnes- i see politics. He defends bis support of Senior and denounces Stokes. The lan guage of bis paper became so personal and 1 abusive that Vice President Colfax objected i to its reading, but at tbo request of other , Senators, the feeble condition of Mr. ■ Brownlow being urged as an excuse for his ’ conduct, the reading was proceeded with. ' In the House of Representatives, a rose- ] lution calling for information in regard to i the payment of tho reward for tho capture 1 of Jeff. Davis was adopted. Other rcsolu- 1 tions and new bills wore introduced and referred to appropriate committees, and ( the Census bill was taken up. The consid- j eration of the bill in Committee of the 1 Whole was concluded, it was reported to * the House, and was debated until the hour ] of adjournment. , Before the Footmots and Behind the Scenes.— Wo have received from tlic publishers, Messrs. Panneleo & Co., ad vance sheets of a new book of the above title, from the brilliant pen of Miss Olive Logan, the former actress, and present lec turer and author. An examination of the | table of contents is such as to excite the strongest interest, and awaken the greatest i curiosity, to see the work. The subject matter treats of that curious world, known in the theatrical parlance as the “Show World, - ’ and includes everything in the shape of amusements that wo ever heard of—oven to lectures, which are often, it must be admitted, the reverse of amusing, except when delivered by a Gough, or an [ Olive Logan—for Miss Logan, is a whole entertainment in herself. It is a peculiarity of this lady's writings, that, whatever else they are, they are never dull. She is al ways bright, witty, anil fascinating, when speaking, or when writing. This hook takes us into the secrets of the “player folk’’—conducts us behind the scenes of the Theatre—takes ns into the dressing-room of the Circus—among the caged animals of Menagerie—exhibits a brilliant phantasmagoria of buffoons, mountebanks, actors, actresses, operatic artists, street tumblers, jugglers, wild- ! beast tamers, their public and private lives, | habits, botli good and bad, and in short, is I a veritable turning “ inside out ” of that mysterious world concerning, which so lit- | tie has hitherto been reliably known. In the bands of an ordinary writer, this , book would suggest much that is danger- j ous to road and introduce to the public; , but, Olive Logan, lias so nobly proved her ! love of good morals, and sound virtuous I principles, that no one need fear that the | tone of the book will be low. No such work has ever been issued from ! the press in any ago or country. It is the : only work of the kind in existence, and is a work which no living person could have produced better than Olive Logan. It is the crowning achievement of her restless genius, and the good it will do bo mind can measure. Beautifully illustrated, sparkling with anecdote and story, full of sound common sense, and pure morality. Wo publish on our first page, this week, some extracts from the work. gin A New- A" ear's Gift for Ai.i,.—The publishers of the American Stock Journal wishing to place a copy of that publication in the bauds of every Farmer, Planter and Stock Breeder in the country, have put up i 100,000 packages, containing a specimen copy, large illustrated Show Bill, a prem ium list, and one of the following 2.1 cent Books: Horseman’s, Hog Breeder’s Sheep I Breeder’s, Dairyman’s or Poultry Breeder's Manual. These packages they offer to send free and post-paid to all who apply for them. Wo hope all our farmer friends will avail themselves of this generous offer, as the Premium list contains many articles, such as Blooded Cattle, Sheep, Hogs, Poultry, Potatoes, Agricultural implement, Sewing Machines. Books, Watches, &c., | &c., that can easily be obtained by a few days’ canvassing for this popular Journal i which is published at the low price of

National for 18T0, as it promises to bo j better than ever, and Peterson always keeps his promise. It would be a very interest- I ing and useful gift. The January number of this most excellent Magazine is on our table, with two splendid steel engravings. The first one is called “ Parted by Fate,’’ and is accompanied with a story by Frank Lee Benedict. The second is called “A Bitter Morning,” and represents two chil skating on the ice. This is one of the most ! cunning pictures we have seen for a long time. We cannot understand how Peter- | son can afford to give the superb Berlin patterns be does, as every color in these patterns lias tube printed separately. The stories arc always interesting. The price of this magazine is only two dollars a year, while the inducements to Clubs are j very great. Specimens arc sent gratis to those wishing to get up clubs. Address Charles J. Peterson, No. 300 Chestnut St., Philadelphia. A Model Parlor Magazine.— For beau ty of typography, artistic engravings, and high-toned literary articles, together with a large and beautiful display of Fashions, Demoretl’t Monthly Magazine is certainly unsurpassed. The January number, just received, in addition to unusual holiday at tractions, lias a fine steel Portrait of both Mr. and Mmo. Dcmorest. The rich display of novelties offered in Dcmorcst's Monthly would seem to be enough to secure a circu lation sufficient to satisfy its publishers, but in addition we sec they propose to give a vary large and fine engraving to each sub scriber, valued at $lO. The Engraving alone would make a very appropriate Holi day or Birthday gift; but when added to the costly picture the best Parlor Magazine is included, to he a monthly reminder of the friendly feeling of the giver, there is certainly no better way of investing $3. — Address Dcmorcst's Monthly, 838 Broad way, N. Y. Circumstances control some men, other men control circumstances. Four hundred thousand dollars’ worth of goods, above and beyond the apparent and ordinary de mand, would throw most men into a fever, if not sink them in hopeless despair. But Messrs. Wanamaker & Brown seem equal to any emergency, and the people are showing the appreciation of their pluck by hand somely patronizing the Sale. “No customer must bo allowed to leave the store unsupplied.” That is one of the orders given at Oak Hall for the present crisis. Not that the salesmen arc to bo rudely importunate, or to try to over-per suade any one, hut that such pains shall be taken to suit, and such accommodation made on prices, that all will, of their own free accord, desire to buy. tST"“Frarient” sends us a sermon.

Wnsliin^tuii. —A largo number of Georgians have ar rived at the Capital to jnotest against Geor gia to representation in Congress iu the manner recommended in the President's message. They are opposed to the appli cation of the test oath to members of the Legislature assembled under Gou. Meade’s ; proclamation. Notwithstanding their oh ; jaetions, tliat will prohaldy he the only basis upon which Georgia will bo admitted to full recognition as a State in the Union. Senators and representatives deem it but a mild rebuke for the expulsion of legally elected members from the State Legislature. —Commissioner Delano has decided that officers of Internal liovonnc shall not be allowed to charge citizens for making out papers which the latter are required to fur nish, and gives notice that those who make such charges will he instantly dismissed from the service. —A delegation representing the National Colored Labor Convention called upon President Grant on Saturday, when an ad dress on behalf of the Convention was made by Senator Jas. 11. Harris, of North Caro lina, pledging to the Administration the i support of the colored men of the country. I President Grant, in response, praised the organization of the colored working men, and said that he was willing to do anything in his power to protect and advance their condition. He also anticipated the coming of a time when no party would make color a test of citizenship. —The Post Office Department has com | pletcd its selections ot designs for a new j series of postage stamps, to take the place of those now in use, which were adopted j by the late Postmaster General Itandall i about one year ago. The new designs will | be one-third larger than the present stamps, i or, in other words, the same size as the old stamps, and consist entirely of profile busts | taken from standard original marbles exo j cuted by artists of acknowledged reputa | lion. They will be engraved and furnished | by the National Bank Note Company, from | photographs from Brady, taken from the original statues and busts, and comprise heads of the following distinguished Amer icans : On the ono-ccnt stamps, bust in Frank lin Institute, Philadelphia ; two-cent, by Powers; three-rent.

The increase over the number exchanged in 18(it> is 1,408,122. — The increase over the number exchanged in 1808 is 1,408,122. Estimating the num ! her exchanged with the Dominion of Can ; ada, of which no accurate account is re ported, at 3,000,000, the whole number of letters exchanged in the mails with foreign countries exceeded 15,500,000. The total postages on letters exchanged with foreign countries, estimating the postage on letters to and from Canada at $330,000. amounted to $2,014,183. —The abolition of the franking privilege, except as it is applied to purely legitimate public business of the Government, is a forgone conclusion, hut it is noticed that Congressmen, as a general rule, are not anxious to discuss the subject, and arc in no hurry to urge final action on any of the bills presented for that purpose. —General Butler’s proposition to abolish the present system of paying army and navy pensions meets with serious opposi tion, because it will legislate out of office all of the pension agents in the country.— It will he remembered that he proposes that they shall be paid by the Pension Bureau through the money-order post offices. —The rumor is revived with great force | that the President intends to oiler the va | caney on the Bench of the Supreme Court } created by the resignation of Justice Grier, jto the illustrious Edwin M.

The nation would applaud the tribute of the Great Soldier to the Great War Minister. —Discussion of the census bill threatens to lie interminable. —On Wednesday next Congress adjourns I until January 3. j —The Philadelphia Preen, in summing ! up the results of the late elections in Mis sissippi and Texas, remarks, under the head of “Southern Whites:” The fact most gratifying in the Missis sippi election is the large white vote thrown for the whole Radical Republican ticket.— Wc gather the following from the Missis sippi papers just received : In twenty-nine counties, with a majority of white votes, the Republicans carry all but three. Tishomingo county, almost exclusively white, votes Republican. Our gain there over last, election is 1,524, and in Lee, another white county, the gain is 1,340. Iu Warren comity, where there arc over eighteen hundred white votes. Judge Dent got but 1,005 votes, proving that some 800 whites voted for Alcorn and the Republi can ticket, or refused to vote against them. The election was bloodless and peaceful; the whole people seemed to he animated by the determination to obey the law and finish agitation. As the Yazoo Republican says, speaking of the result in Yazoo county, where the Republicans bad a majority of over eighteen hundred, and a gain over the last election of over fifteen hundred : “ The colored voters have acted nobly, as was expected ; but the most cheering aspect of the conflict and victory is the fact that the masses, in spite of the pressure of party and its discipline, have risen in their might to rebuke the last struggle of the secession leaders in favor of the ‘Lost Cause.’ ” The majority of General Alcorn, the Re publican candidate for Governor, will be thirty thousand at least. Two-thirds of the Legislature arc Radicals, and five Rad icals are elected to Congress—Harris in the First. Morphies in the Second, Barry in the Third. McKee in the Fourth, and Force in the Fifth District. In Texas, where the election lasted four days, the same peace and good-will are re ported. Large numbers of whites voted the Republican ticket. Here, as in Missis sippi, tbe froedmea were solid, showing that, where they have no protection, they prefer their friends. The theory—based upon the manner in which they have been threatened and persecuted into voting the Democratic ticket in Georgia—that they would eventually he controlled by their former masters, is completely refuted by their solid unity iu Texas and Mississippi. The value of these data is two-fold. The whites of the South are finally satisfied that there is uo resisting reconstruction, and the Democrats of the North, who are soon to see the colored men voting in their midst, cannot resist an example so full of wisdom. ><n liavv •->atii:na! cheerful ness ami Imp- 1 piiu*ss ot: roar wifi*'* iMiint. iiaiice?
