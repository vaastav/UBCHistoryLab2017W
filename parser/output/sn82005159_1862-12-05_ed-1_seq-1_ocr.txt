[From the Piftnot <J- Union.] THE DEATH OF THE RENEGADE. At midnight, on his oilice lounge, Forney was dreaming of the hour • When Democrats, in suppliance bent, Should tremble at his power; In drcnius to Washington be bore Election news, as conqueror; In dreams, his song of triumph sung; Then heard bold Sumner's words of praise Then, through old Abratn, made a raise Of contracts, that in profit pays, Tlie gold from frccincn wrung. At midnight, in another square, • The Democrats their council held ; The good, the great, the wise were there, And with high hopes their bosoms swelled They were the sons of those who stood, No firmly for their country's good, In days of Jackson—bold ; And now, they felt that, without pause, They'd fight us bravely for our cause, • The Constitution and the laws, As did their sires of old. As time passed on, Forney awoke, That bright dream was his last— Ho woke—to hear the ringing shout, . That heralded the utter rout, •Of those who, tor the "counterband," Would flood with gore our happy land, And madly into ruin east A government by patriots formed, And held by compromise unharmed. He woke, —to hoar his naino, That once upon the record stood, "With those who for their country's good Would sacrifice their wealth and blood— Coupled with every shame. He woke—to hear all good men say. Thank God, this ends the recreant's power, The dog is dead—he's had his day, And 'neath the lash must ever cower. His traitor comrades clearly saw Jlim droop, when rang the proud huzza, And all his hopes were sunk. Then saw him close his bottle clasp, And struggle in its deadly grasp Until lie fell dead drunk. Come to the bridal chamber, denin i Come to the mother, when she feels, For the first time, her first-born's breath v Come when the blessed seals That close the pestilence are broke, And crowded cities wail its stroke ; Come in consumption's glastly form, The earthquake's shock the ocean's storm ; Come when the heart heats liigh and warm With banquet-song, and dance and miine- And thou art terrible ! —The tear, The groan tho knell, the pall, the bier, Are dreadful; —yet with conscience clear Wc calmly hide our time. But to tlbe man whose perjured soul With every evil thought is crammed, Thy v<iee sounds like a prophet's word ; And in its hollow tones arc heard, The glee of fiends who wait the damned. John Forney! in thy traitor grave, Condemned to infamy through time, Kent thee: thero is no greater knave Storied in any clime. Wc tell thy doom without a sigh For thou notorious now, art Fame's —• One of the few, dctostod names Immortal in their infamy. Buchanan's Final Reply to Scott. To the Editors of the National Intelligencer: With a few remarks, I shall close the contro versy with Gen. Scott, into which I have been most reluctantly forced by his voluntary and un expected attack. This has, nevertheless, afford ed mo an opportunity of correcting many un founded reports which I had long borne in pa tience and in silence. In my answer, I have already furnished clear and distinct responses to all the allegations of Gen. Scott; and in his rejoinder he has not call ed in question any of my statements, with a single exception. Which of us is correct in this particular depends upon the question whether his recollection of an event which occurred more than eighteen months ago, or the state ment of Mr. Holt, reduced to writing on the very day, is entitled to tlie greater credit. The General, in the introduction of his re joinder, assigns as an excuse for the criticism on my public conduct that this was merely in cidental to his alleged official report to Presi dent Lincoln on the condition of our fortifica tions, and was not primarily intended for my self. From this statement one would conclude that he had made such a report. Hut where is this to be found? For it lie refers to the Intel ligencer of the 21t of October; but there 1 discover nothing but his letter of four points to Mr- Seward, dated on the 8d Marcli, 1801, ad vising the incoming President how to guide his administration in face of the threatening dan gers to tho country. In the single introducto ry sentence to this letter he barely refers to bis "printed views," (dated in October, I860,) which had been long before the public; but it contains nothing like an official report on the condition of the fortifications. Whether the introduction of this letter to tho public without the consent of President Lincoln, by one of tho General's friends, in a political speech during a highly excited gubernatorial canvass, had influenced him to prepare his crit- icism on my conduct, it is not for me to deter mine. At what period did Gen. Scott obtain the six hundred recruits to which he refers in his rejoiaderl This was certainly after the date of his "views," OO the 30th October, I860; be- those 1)0 states emphatically that the 

VOLUME .18. NEW SERIES. forces then at his command were "in nil five companies only within reach to garrison or re inforce (he (nine) forls mentioned in the "views." Did he obtain these recruits in November? If so, had he visited Washington or written and explained to me in what manner this military operation could he accomplished by the four hundred men in the live companies, and the six hundred recruits, I should have given his rep resentations all the consideration eminently due to his high military reputation. But he informs us lie did not arrive in Wash ington until the I2ih of December. His second recommendation to garrison these forts must consequently have been made, according to his own stalcmcnt, on the 13th, loth, 28th, or 30th of December, or on more than one of these days. At tins period the aspect of public affairs had greatly changed from what it was in October. Congress was now in session, and our relations with the Seceding Cotton States had been pla ced before them by the President's message. Proceedings had been instituted by that body with a view to a.compromise of the dangerous questions lietwcen the North and the South; and the highest hopes and warmest aspirations were then entertained for their success. Under these circumstances it was the President's duty to take a broad view of the condition of the whole country, in all its relations, civil, indus trial and commercial, as well as military, giv ing to each its appropriate influenrc. It was only from such a combination that ho could frame a policy calculated to preserve the peace and to consolidate the strength of the Union. Isolated recommendations proceeding from one department, without weighing well their effect upon the general policy, ought to be adopted with extreme dhution. Hut it seems from the rejoinder (lint Secreta ry Floyd, at Hichmond, had claimed the honor of defeating Gen. Scott's "plans and solicita tions respecting the forts," "it being there," says the General, "universally admitted that hut for that victory over me there could have been no rebellion." This is, in plain English, that the secessionists of the cotton States, who have since brought into the field hundreds of thousands of undoubtedly brave soldiers, would have abandoned in terror their unlawful anil re bellious designs, had Gen. Scott distributed a mong their numerous forts four hundred meu in October, or one thousand men in l>eecmber! This requires no comment. 1 have never been able to obtain a copy of tfenYScotf refers"bufTTeanfe.Tfell, at the time and since, from gentlemen of high respectability; that in this same speech he de nounced me most bitterly for my determination In stand by and sustain the Union with all the power I possessed uuder the Constitution and the laws. And here permit me to remark that it is due to Gen. Scott as well as myself to deny that there is any portion of my answer which justi fies the allegation that "the ex-l'resident sneers at my 'weak tUvicc ,' (the words 'weak device' being marked as a quotation) for saving the forts." This mistake I must attribute to his "accidental visitor." And in this connexion I emphatically declare that the General, neither before nor after the publication of his "views" in the National In telligencer of the 18th January, 1801, without my consent, assigned any reason to mo for ma king this publication, or ever even alluded to the subject. In this I cannot be mistaken, from the deep impression which the occurrence made upon my memory, for the reasons already men tioned in my answer. I should have nothing more to add had Gen. •Scott, in his rejoinder, confined himself to the topics embraced in his original letter. lie has extended them, and now for the first time, and in a sarcastic and no kindly spirit, refers to the alleged stealing of public arms by Secretary Floyd and their transportation to the South in anticipation of the rebellion. The most con clusive answer to this allegation is that, not withstanding the boasting of Mr. Floyd at Rich mond, evidently with the. view of conciliating his new allies, cited by the General as his au thority, no public arms were ever stolen. This fact is established by the report of the Committee on Military Affairs of the House of Representatives, now before mo, made by Mr. Stanton, of Ohio, their chairman, on the 18th volume of the Reports of Committees of the House for the session of 1860-61. This re port and the testimony before the committee es tablish: 1. That the Southern States received in 1800 less instead of more than the quota of arms to which they were entitled bylaw; and that threo of them—North Carolina, Mississippi and Ken tucky—-received no arms whatever, and this sim ply because they did not ask for them. Well may Mr. Stanton have said in the House "that there are a good deal of rumors and specula tions and misapprehension as to the true state of facts in regard to this matter." 2. Secretary Floyd, under suspicious circum stances, on the 22d December, 18(30, and but a few Jays before he left the Department, had, without the knowledge of the I'rcsidcnt, order ed 113 columbiads and 11 thirty-two pounders to be transported from Pittsburg to Ship Island and Galveston, in Mississippi and Texas. This fact was brought to the knowledge of the President by a communication from Pitts burg; and .Secretary Holt immediately there after countermanded the order of his predeces sor, and the cannon wero never scut. Tho promptitude with whichjwe acted elicited a voto of thanks, dated on the 4th of January, 18(31, from the Select and Common Councils of that city, '-to tho President, the Attorney General, and the acting Secretary of War." (Mr. llolt.) After this statement how shall we aocount for tho explicit declaration of Gen. Scott that, "accidentally hearing early in March that under this posthumous order (that of Mr. Floyd of the 22d I>ecember) the shipment of these guns bad commenced, 1 communicated the fact to Freedom of Thought tod Opinion. 

BEDFORD, PA., FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 5, 1862. Secretary Holt, (acting for Secretary Cameron,) just in time to defeat (lie robbery V And this is the same Secretury Holt who h vd countermanded "the posthumous order" in the previous December. And, strange to say, these guns, but for the alleged interposition of Gen. Scott, were about to be sent so late as March from the Loyal States into those over which Jefferson Davis had then for some time pre sided ! Had General Scott reflected, for a moment, lie could uot have fallen into this blander.— It is quite manifest he was "without a print ed ami my (his) own ollicial pa pers." 3. The Government had on hand in the year 1859 about 500,000 old muskets, which had been condemned "as unsuitable for public ser vice," under the acl of 3d of March, 1825. They were of such a character that although offered both at public and private sale for $2 50 each, purchasers could not be obtained at that rate, exuept for u comparatively small num ber. Gn tho 30th of November, 1859, Secretary Floyd ordered about one-fifth of the whole number (105,000) to be sent from the Spring field armory, where they had accumulated, to live Southern arsenals, "in proportion to their respective means of proper storage." This or der was carried into effect by the Ordnance Bureau in the usual course of administration and without reference to the President. It is but justice to say that from the testi mony before the committee there is no reason to suspect that Secretary Floyd issued this or der from any sinister motive, its date was mouths before Mr. Lincoln's nomination for the Presidency, and nearlya year before bis election, and whilst (he Secretary was still an avowed opponent of secession. Indeed, the testimony of Col. Craig and Capt. .Maynadier, of the Ordnance, before the Committee is wholly in consistent with any evil intention on his part. And yet these "condemned muskets," with a few thousand ancient rifles of a calibre then no longer used, are transformed by General Scott into "115,000 extra mtuketi and rifles, with all their implements and ammunition." This is the fust time I have heard—aWainly there was nothing of the kind before tlic committee—that ammunition was sent with these condemned and inferior arms to their places of storage—just as though they had been intended not for sale but for immediate use in the field. arnis and t rans'porf 'theni lfom one depository M another without the knowledge and active par ticipation ot the ollicera of the Ordnance Bu reau, botlt at Washington and at these deposi tories.

JAMES BUCHANAN. WHEATI.ASD, near Lancaster, Nov. 17, 1802. The Twelve Puritan Crimes which no Man Can Gainsay. Whatever Ilenry Wanl Beeeher, who pre tends to be a Christian may say, we intend to day to present a record which even lie dares not deny. Wet lien present what we cnll thtttccli* Pu ritan crimes, and let clerical humbugs, who have displaced the Gospel foV their diabolisms, con trovert us. We are aware of this, that good men, theologians, Who are now filling Northern pulpits, and who get their salaries by succum bing to Northern prejudices, take ground against the South. But let us look at the affair as it stands, and if the vast interests of Christianity are against the teachings ot the Puritans, let us ignore them, and turn to the doctrines of the Bible. This we know may bo difficult, and the more so, because the wealth of the Northern churches is, at present, held by the Abolitionists, and they pay the salaries of the ministers, alas! too much governed by Mam mon. Now what are the tieelce Puritan crimes ? T.et us record them for the sake ot history, and we give them because they militate against Freedom, Humanity and the Union. First. The crime in the beginning of blind and cruel persecutions, in putting to death per sons of other belief than their own, imprison ing, banishing or killing Episcopalians, and Bap tists, Hogging Quaker women upon their naked backs in the public streets, imprisoning and ban ishing and hanging them, aye, ami hanging even women as witches. Second. The crime of stealing negroes by whole sale and bringing them from Alriea and selling them as slaves to the South. Third. The crime, according to their present theology, of agreeing to the Constitution anil forming this Union, on the condition of exclu ding nil foreign ships from the carrying trade of the South, and securing a monopoly of' the slave trade for twenty years, thus bringing in all the slaves that ever were brought into the U nion, and agreeing to secure protection to sla very for the contract moiwpoly m, the slave trade. Fourth. The crime of thus agreeing to the Constitution, JIB a bond ol Union, and then, when enriched by the slave trade and slave pro duce, annulling this covenant with the South and the Union, and setting to work to break up the Constitution and destroy the Union! Fifth. The crime of making slavery, of which themselves tfere most guilty, (if there be guilt,) the pretence of this breach of faith, and for this appalling betrayal of the hopes of man in self government; this horrible outrago upon the wido world's freedom and humanity ! Sixth. The crime of treason to the Union in the war of 1812, striking our national colors in Canada, under the Puritan Hull, refusing the government call for troops to defend the U nion, burning blue lights for the enemy upon our coasts as treason signals to betray the Union. Seventh. The crime of the Hartford Conven tian in 1814 for dissolving the Union—dissol ving the Union by tho vote of Massachusetts' | legislation on the admission of Louisiana, and again, attempting to dissolve thellnion on the ad mis siou of Texas—the sending of Adams to Cengress to present petitions for the dissolution of the Union in 1842 and permitting the trea son of Hale, who presented ei'j/tt petitions for tie dissolution of the Union in 1800-0 I 1 Eighth. The crime of persecuting the defend on! of the Constitution and the Union, among idiom the foremost was
