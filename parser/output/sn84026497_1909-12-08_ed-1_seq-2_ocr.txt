My Dkar Eiiitor: You ara hereby authorized to announce my name aa a ramlirialo for Conirretia In (be Twenty Kihlh Congressional District of Penn sylvania, auliject to the rulea governing the Primaiy to be held Saturday, June 4lu, 1910. N. P. WHKKt.KR. Cuiia ia reported to have crisis due to diaappointed ofhee aeekera. A republio subject to revolution from this cause can never hope to settle one emergency with out runuitiff into another. Salt In now finding lta medical advo cates, even at the season of the year when it ia the principal agent in salting down the things which are to work mightily lor indigestion during the coming year. Thk United States courts will do the country a valuable service if they can make competition take the place of com bination in afftira of business. Let free dom reign again, is a popular slogan. Thk holding of farmers' institutes throughout Pennsylvania for the winter season under the auspices of the Agri cultural Department baa already begun, saya the Punxy Spirit. Instructive pro grams are arranged and competent lec tures are provided. These Institutes are Dot only very Instructive, but highly beneficial in a social way. The farmera are beginning to look forward to tbem with pleasure, and many of the. Ideas and suggestions there received are put to practical use. Every farming community should have at least one of these Institutes during the winter season. After December SI the new state law as to automobiles will go into effect ia Pennsylvania and its provisions will knock city and borough ordinances end ways, so far as speed limit la concerned. After that date it ia permissable for the machines to run -i miles an bour except where signs are erected bearing the word "Dangerous," when it will be imperative to run the machine not faster than 12 miles an hour. As these signs must be placed on every street and painted in large letters to compel the observance of the lower speed law, it will be realized that veiy little will be done iu this line, Dksions for the new postal cards to be furnished by the government have been approved by Postmaster General Hitch cock. Tbey will be issued on January 1 The bead of McKinley will be continued on the ordinary card, but a better likeness of the late president has been secured and the border design has been improved on On the new small card, intended for in' dex purposes and for social correspond' ence, the bead of Lincoln will appear, The two cent International card will bear a portrait of General Grant. The double or reply card will contain a new feature, On the original message half will appear a likeness of General Washington, while the stamp on tbe reply will contain a picture of Martha Washington. Post office department officials say that tbe borders of tbe stamps on all the different cards will present an attractive diversity. Thk bunting season, which closed No vember 30th was marked by many fatal accidents as usual, the number of dead reaching 90 and tbe injured 43. In tbe previous year 57 were slain, in 1907, fti and iu 1900, 74. Wisconsin and upper Michigan continue to furnish tbe greatest number of victims. Tbe number of killed and injured in various states were: Arkansas, 1 killed; Illinois, 8 killed, 2 in jured; Indiana, 4 killed, 2 Injured; Iowa, 3 killed, 1 injured; Kansas, 1 killed; Maine, 1 killed, 1 injured; Michigan, 14 killed, 4 injured. Minnesota, 3 killed, 7 injured; Missouri, 1 injured; Nebraska, 8 killed; New York, 2 killed; North Da kota, 1 killed, 1 injured; Ohio, 3 killed; Oklahoma, 1 killed; Pennsylvania 12 killed; Wisconsin 26 killed, 20 injured; District of Columbia, 1 killed, 1 injured; Canada, 1 killed. Total, 00 killed, 43 in jured. Thb health officer of the Dlstriot of Columbia wants to abolish the Chautau qua salute because tbe waving of band kercblels may throw germs into the air. This shows just bow crazy a man can get over an idea. Tbe handkerchiefs waved by Chautauqua audiences belong to dainty little school ma'ams, neat old ladies whose delicately perfumed lace squares would not carry any germs, stu dious young mothers who are as neat as surgeons and would not take germ-laden handkerchiefs to lectures. Tbe man who is making the fuss about tbe salute ought to go over to tho Capitol at Washington and make a protest ovor the germs that come with every train to Washington in palace cars, some visible and some in visible, and over the way tbe germs get into tbe tainted money that passes around down there. Be is not doing the country any good by fussing about tbe Cbautau- tauqua salutes. Franklin News. Mr. Wheeler a Candidate. Formal annouucement of tbe candidacy of Hon. N. P. Wheeler for Congress, troru the 2Sth district, appears in this issue of Tbe Breeze. Mr. Wbeeler, who is seek log a renomination, has proven a trusty official, worthy of his party's support, and bas no opposition for the place as yet Sandy Lake Breeze. Tbe sentiment in favor of tbe re-elec tion of Nelson P. Wheeler as Congress' ruau from tbo 281b district appears to be growing stronger iu Mercer county every day since tbe withdrawal of James P Whitla of Sharon. It is generally held throughout the eastern half of the county that Mr. Wboeler'a record during tbe past four years in office bas demonstrated biB fitness for tbe position, and the indlca lions are that Mercer county will go solid for bim inasmuch as tbere seems little probability that another candidate will Bntr the race from this county. bharon Eveuiug Telegraph. Hon. Nelson P. Wheeler, Representa tive in Congress from tbe Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania district, which Includes Mercer, Venango, Warren, Forest and Elk counties, has authorized tbe an nouncement that he will be a candidate next year for re-noinination on the Re- publican ticket. To date be Is tbe only caudidate la tbe Held, but It Is not likely that be will be permitted to carry off tbe honor without a contest. However, be Is in a position to make a strong fight. Mr, Wbeeler on Monday will enter on bia second term in Congress and be can go before tbe people with an excellent record lo recommend bim. During bis two years in Washington he has won recogni tlon as an earnest supporter of the ad ministration and one of the most effective workers in tbe lower House, though his activities have been confined to commit tee and routine work. His long and successful business career bas proved ot great value and increased bis usefulness as a representative. He bas served bis constituents faithfully, regardless of pol itics, and by carefully guarding their in terests baa made a boat of friends. With Mr. Whitla out of tbe race, be likely will be tbe choice of the majority of Mercer county Republicans. Unquestionably be will poll practically tbe entire vote in Forest, wblle he will have strong fol lowing in every other county In the dis trict, no matter bow many candidates may oppose bim. This being admitted, and as the nomination will be made by direct vote of the people, bis chances of success seem very bright. Mercer Dis patch and Republican. This paper has been duly authorized to announce the name of Hon. N. P. Wbeeler, of Endeavor, Forest county, our present able and popular Representative in Congreaas a candidate for re-election to the office which be bas filled with so much credit to himself and his party, and much to tbe benefit of all tbe Interests of bis district, and tbe announcement will be found in another column of this paper. Mr. Wbeeler is now serving bis second term in Congress, and will go to Wash ington tbe last of this week to be in bis seat when Congress is called together on Monday next. During tbe brief time Mr. Wbeeler bas been in Congress be has not only been found on tbe right side on every question peculiarly affecting the people of his district, but be has done ef fective work for the interests of bis peo ple. Mr, Wbeeler bas never been much of a politician, or self-seeker for himself, but be is a splendid business man, and having been called to tbe high office sim ply because of bis excellent character and Hue business ability, he bas taken bold of tbe duties of tbe office with a firm grasp and earnest purpose, and it is surprising wbat good things be bas been able to do for bis district in spite of bis lack of ex perience in Congress at the start. Tbe fact that be bad represented bis own county for a term or two in tbe State Legislature a number of years ago was probably of some use to bim in getting on to tbe ways of law makers, but be bas been a very apt scholar, and the work be bas accomplished is very satisfactory to bis constituents. We bave no doubt he will be renominated and re-elected, and be certainly well deserves it. It is for tuuate for bis party that such a clean and honorable man aa Mr. Wheeler Is willing to accept the nomination and give tbe party the benefit of bis clean recoid and high standing as a member of Cougress. Ridgway Daily Record. President Tail's Message. President Taft's first annual message lo Congress was read in both Houses yes terday and was received with profound interest. It is Just tbe calm, dignified and common sense document that one would expect to come from a man like our present cbief magistrate. Tbe Presi dent deals with every Important issue that is before tbe American people and makes himself clearly understood on every point. Tbere Is no quibbling or "beating about the bush," but eery topic ia fully discussed In a plain straight forward way. The Republican presents tbe document to its readers Ibis morning and is confident it will be carefully scanned by all of tbem. KellcttTille W. C. T. U. Tbe work of the Women's Christian Temperance Union at Kellettville is wor thy of mention, as progress is being made in several important respects. Mrs. Ellen B. Catlin, as president, Is a wise and efficient leader and ber helpful in fluence is always given as needed in tbe various departments. Tbe Kellettville Union is now in its third year and in that time tbe members have enjoyed the social side of the meetings and bave all secured a broader and brighter vision ol wbat the W.C. T. U. as a world-body is accom plishing. Among tbe recent interesting meetings beld was tbe Parlor Meeting at Mrs. Andrews' ball, November 17th, at which most of Its members and many invited guests were present. Mrs. Lilly Dotterer, as superintendent of tbe Parlor Meeting, bad an interesting program ar ranged, after which fried-cakes, coffee and fruit were served, and during the social part of tbe meeting names of six new members were secured. At a meet ing beld December 1st, at Mrs. Mary Tobey's home, tbe State report as sub mitted by Mrs, Nettie Adams, of Tio nesta, whb enjoyed and appreciated by all.

CHENEY & CO., Toledo, O. Sold by Druggists, 75. Hall's Family Pills are the best. Pennsylvania Is Out of Debt. Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania, pros perous and proud. Pennsylvania, tbo best governed In our galaxy of States. Pennsylvania, the leader In enterprise and energy. Its strong arm protecting in nil their rights both tho employer and the employed. Us departments making the pace for all th other States In this great nation in chari table and philanthropic efforts. Its well defined purpose of regulation without confiscation or destruction and at the same time administering graciously to those In need or distress have made It great beyond compre hension almost. Its magnificent ad ministration, courageous and capable; its efficient financial system and Its abundant revenues, drawn almost en tirely from sources capable of produc ing them without being burdensome or oppressive, give to Pennsylvania the undisputed record for being tho best governed State In this wldo coun try. The proud position of tho Stato makes tho people of the State proud. And Pennsylvania is absolutely free of debt. No other State In the union can make that proud bonst. If any other State has Pennsylvania's en viable record, that record Is not known. Pennsylvania's record of to day Is today's record of the Republi can party and of those who havo made the Republican porty what It is today. The fact must be conceded. Therefore, all hail to Republican Pennsylvania. May sho live long and prosper. Rev. J. Leonard Levy, D. D when the announcement was mnde last weeks that the State was entirely free, from debt, and, beside, had money enough for all legitimate purposes In Its strong box, sent a delightful thrill throughout the State by saying: "That certainly speaks well for the Republican administration. The an nouncement Is particularly full of meaning, too, when we reflect on what the critics had been saying that the Republican rule would mean extrava gance and that the money of the peo ple would not be safe In Its bands. Now to hear thot the State Is out of debt well, I can only repeat that It certainly speaks well for the Re publican administration." Dr. Levy also said that Edwin S. Stuart was one of the very best gov ernors the country had ever known. Dr. Levy is admittedly one of the leaders of his people In America. He Is pastor of the Rodeph Shalom con gregation In Tlttsburg and he enjoys the distinction of being the highest priced minister In America. If he does not really enjoy that distinction his friends do and he Is beloved wherever he Is known. Have a look about at the other States. Heretofore Massachusetts has been the pride of tho nation. The administration of that State has been thorough and good, but the record es tablished by Massachusetts is entirely eclipsed by that of Pennsylvania. Be yond question Massachusetts Is a great and prosperous State but it has hardly half the population of Penn sylvania, yet model Massachusetts has a State debt of about IG6.000.000. Pennsylvania Is free from debt. Tho ordinary revenues of our State are close to $30,000,000 annually and every penny of that vast Income Is systematically and honestly disbursed. Gov. Stuart, of the people and for the people, has had a prominent part In keeping Pennsylvania great. His Rc; ublican associates In the existing administration of the State's affairs also deserve liberal credit, but tho State administration reflects the pur poses of the Republican party leod ers In the State. Gov. Stuart summed up the pleasing situation when he said: "It Is a matter of great gratifica tion to know that the State is out of debt. We could pay off every bond now and have over $3,000 left if tho people who own the bonds would pre sent them. More than that, our sink ing fund is earning money and, as the bulk of the bonds will not fall due until 1912, we will secure from $40,000 to $50,000 a year until that time through the operation of the law regu lating such deposits of State money. I am more than glad to be able to make this announcement about the State's excellent provision to meet its bonds." Detailed reports on the State's record-breaking income show that $9, 916,840.41 came from lax on the capi tal stock of corporations and $4,315, 441.85 from State tax on personal property. These two Hems make up more than a third of the total In come of $29,101,183.70, which Is $2. 000,000 beyond the previous high water mark, that of $27,027,000 made In the fiscal year of 1907 with the aid of some bond Bales. This year's huge Income Is largely flue to the enforcement of laws for the crlrctlon of delinquent tax and the vigor with which licenses, fines and other sources of Income havfl eeu followed up. The total amouM of disbursements reaches the record figure of $30,021,773.57, but the Stata started the year so well that the bal ance amounts to $8,620,014.79, of which $5,967,979.83 is In the general fund. This is the first year in ntna that the general fund balance has gone below $6,000,000, and the pre diction is made that it will go lower next year, so that Gov. Stuart's reduc tion of appropriations by the last leg islature is largely Justified. The bonded debt sheet shows that the State had a net debt of $47,085.91 on the corresponding day last year, but that since that time $45,700 of bonds have been redeemed, so that the State debt stands at $2,643,917.02 and the sinking fund $2,652,034.96. The principal Items of State In come afford an Interesting study. Tho source of Income, next to the two Items mentioned, was the State tax on corporate loans of bonds, amounting to $2,497,480.81. Next came the State tax on corporate gross receipts, yield ing $1,520,973.84, while the Insurance companies paid in $1,340,215.64 as the State tax on premiums. Collateral In heritance tax paid $1,739,852.73. Tbe peculiar properties of Chamber Iain's Cough Remedy , bave been thoroughly tested during epidemics cf influenza, and when It was taken in time we bave not heard of a single case of pneumonia.
