the pKiJiiui:>rs missage. j The annual message of President | llavvs, as it comes foith in advance ot j its delivery to Congiess, logins by con- j gratulating that body upon the success I ?f the financial operations ot the treas ury and their good effects upon the bus- i iucss ot the country. The resume is not materially different troiu the facts and ti -ures presented in the report of the Secretary ot the Treasury, to be found elsewhere, and of which we treat in an other article. 'Hie public credit has been as greatly benefited by resumption as the general business of the country, and the President thinks that all the re maining 5 per cent, and 6 per cent, se curities of the government can be re funded in 4 per cent, bonds, thus effect iug a further reduction of $11,01)0,000 in annual iuterest. . The silver dollars coined under tne recent acts ot Congre* * no* ^ A 4 5,000,850, of which #3f?*00, 334 still remain in the treasury. I Pou 1 ,e a8|6 , of this tact and of the current propos- , lion for unity ot action to effect a per manent system tor the equality of gold and tsilver in the exchange between com Mietvial nations, the President advises Congress to refrain from further experi ments with the coinage and to suspend the coining of silver dollars as now or dered by law. lie says that "the retirement from cir culation of United States notes, with the capacity of legal-tender in private con tracts, is a step to be taken in our pro gress towards a sa(W and stable curreu cy, which should be accepted as the |?ol- ! icy and duty of the government and the interest aud security ot the people." The President expresses it as his "tirin c-onvictiou" that the issue of legal-teuder paper money on the credit and authority ot the government, except in extreme emergency, **is without wan ant in the constitution and a violation ot sound fi nancial principles." lie therefore advo cates their retirement and the rigid main tenance ot the sinking lunds, in order to extinguish the national debt as soon as possible, in pursuit ot our traditional government policy. It more revenue needed, it can be easily obtained by duties on tea and coffee. The President refers to the continued deliberate violation of the laws sup pressing polygamy by prominent cit izens ot Utah, and demands the strict enforcement of these laws, which have Wen decided to be constitutional by the Supreme Court. lie appeals to Congress and the peo ple of the country to unite in bringing general public opinion to bear in favor of the general observance ot and respect tor the laws enforcing the sanctity ot ihe suffrage throughout the whole land, and launches into a long and earnest ar gument in favor of his views about the reform ot the civil service, which have M-veral times before been discussed by fiim. The President leports that con siderable satisfactory progress lias alrea dy been made in these directions, but be thinks that much remains still to be done. He distinguishes elaborately be ween offices which are simply executive and administrative and those which are more or less political, deeming it to be eminently proper for the Presidents of ficii! advisers to explain before the peo ple the policy of an administration brought into office by the popular vote, and advocates the providing of just and :i (equate means t*?r examining candidates foi office, so that the worthiest claimant may be cei tain ot getting the appoint ment. The President's duties iu these particulars are obvious, but he contends j hat nothing adt quite in the premises can be accomplished by him without the eo operation ot Congress and the con siderate and intelligent support of the people. The resumption ot work by the t ivil service commission is recouiended, aud an appropriation to that end is urged. Tlit- foreign relations of the govern ment continue peaceful. The difficulty ' with (ireat liriiain growing out of the Port line i?ay (Newfoundland) outrages is being considered by Lord Ueacons fieM's govei nmeiit. The fisheries ques- I tion, only temporary adjusted by the treaty at Washington, needs to be per manently settled as a whole, and nego tiations to that end are now in progress. The message also touches upon the cat tic trade restrictions, upon life-saving measures taken by the Dominion gov ernment in connection with the com merce of the great lakes, and upon the Australian international shows, recom mending an increased appropriation for American exhibits. The late treaty with Japan, it is ex pected, will serve as a model fcr other countries. China has expressed willing ness to discuss the emigration question >viih us in a dispassionate way, and ne gotiations to that end are now pending. Uorder raids on the Iiio Grande fron tier have been checked, and our diplo matic intercourse with the United States of Columbia is again restored. This is regarded as especially fortunate i:; view of the prominence which has just been attained by interoceanic canal pioject. Our increasing trade with Mexico and South America suggests to the Presi dent the expediency of Congress pro dding means for regular and more fre quent mail communication with these countries. Additional legislation is claimed to be needed for the protection of the rights of people in Alaska, and a form 1 ol territorial government is recommend ed there. The President after comment ing upon the operations of the army and navy during the year, and showing that the Department of Justice has been ob structed by lack of appropriations and that the business of the Supreme Court is largely in arrears as to demand the creation of intermediate courts and the appointment of additional circuit judges; considers with approval the propositions of the Postmaster-General in regard to increased facilities for domestic and for eign mail service. The Indian problem is fully treated of in the message, and the President recommends specifically to Congress the suggestions of Secretary Schurz and Commissioner llayt upon this subject, , which have already been explained. lie says that, while the Executive is deter mined to protect the Indians in their territorial rights, it would be unwise to ignore the fact that organized raids like that against the Cherokee country, which was broken up by Executive proclamation in last April, are liable to be repeated year alter year as the land gets scarcer and more valuable, and hence the expediency of speedy changes in onr Indian policy. At the same time the President deprecates the proposed transfer of the Indians from the Interior j to the War Department. The President renews his recommen dations in favor of enlarging the facili- j ties of the department of .agriculture. | lie also calls the attention of Congress to the paramount subject o( education ' aud its progress, urges the oompletiou ot the Washington monument, aud in- i vokes a generous policy on the part ot the national legislature towards the District of Columbia, its throughfareft,ap proaches and its schools. The message is clearly and plainly i written, and reviews all the national at* fairs in an exhaustive %av. .the coun* try will probably be surprised to find that the subject of civil service reform, j which it was generally supposed had ! been abandoned, still occupies such a j large space in the President's thoughts. II is remarks and his recommendations in regard to the treatment of the cur rency will be generally welcomed and j applauded as resting upon the soundest financial principles, aud the tone of the j message is throughout conciliatory and i conservative. ?

On Tuesday of last week, I run over the hill to Ganotown, Berkeley county, to lend the sanction of my presence to the marriage of Mr. Algernon Barney ; to Miss Lona A. Gain. I was just too late to witness the ceremony, but was in time to kiss the bride, and to enjoy J a In i r share of the bountiful dinner, to which we did ample justice, two weeks "keeping bachelor's hall" having given us an admirable appetite. We returned in the evening, and had the good fortune to sight three wild tui keyson our return, but we only 'sight ed' them, tor they Hew away betore we could get ready to shoot.

TEMPLAR. _ _ _ .... ? i 4 O H VII *li'ATKI>. Mr. Editor ? Prompted by that which every man should have for his race, viz: low, I wish to call the attention of the public to the fact that my people are 1 not to be blamed iu full (or the troubles in which they have gotten from viola tions of law. There is an iu visible hand, or a grkat wiikkj. around which these small wheels revolve. Last year many ot the colored citizens ot Shep herdstown got into trouble about t lie public free school, doing what they i were advised to do by those whom they took to be their friends ? not knowing at the time that their best friends were they who advised to the contrary. I also see in your last issue that the col ored people at Kearneysville havo got ten into trouble about their school, and I am very sorry indeed. I know nearly all of the colored people about Kerneys ville, and were it not for the unseen hand, or great iv'iee/,- alluded to above, Prof. Carey could have not so justly and tiuthiully compared his troubles and trials with those ot" Job, ami the colored people w ho now stand as viola tors of law would be considered peace able citizens. I was afraid that my Kerneysville friends would get into trouble, and I went out there two or three times and talked the matter over, just to save my friends. I knew Prof. Carey had sense enough to take care of himself, so i was looking out for my people. When John Brown captured Har per's Ferry, he knew just what his des tiny would be it his friends and advisers forsook him, but tuy colored friends did not know it. History tells us that the heathen worship idols, and still they are not accountable for their folly until they refuse the light when it is given. The way my people look at things which concern their best interests is equiva lent to the worship of idols. Unless the colored people drop these pretended friends of (heirs, who are getting them into small troubles, they will soon get , into a condition that will clearly prove that they are not worthy of the posi tions they hold in these United Stales. I hope the time will soon come when colored people will appreciate intelli gence, iustead of trying to destroy those who are intelligent. Fools are not do ing much harm among the people, but those whom people think are wise. Some people will work until they gain the confidence of many, and get them to follow, aud then they will lead them to the devil before they can get away from thetu again, I ABRAHAM PIXOX.

The Washington S'ur of Thursday the 20th contains the following mention of an unpleasant society sensation: The announcement of the separation of ex-Governor Swann, ot Maryland, a millionaire, ami who represented the city ot Baltimore in Congress lor sever al terms, from his wife, whom he mar ried but a little over a year ago, at her home in l'rincelou, New Jersey, has caused much stir in social as well as po litical circles. The Governor hat. long had a magnificent home in this city, where he has entertained in princely style. Mrs. Swann was conspicuous in society more than twenty years ago as the wife of Senator Thomson, of New i Jersey. The prominence of both par ties has, therefore, afforded a bounteous supply of material for gossip. A lady distinguished in social circles here, who was a noted beauty at the time of .Mrs. Thompson's reign in socie ty here from 1H5.5 to 1-SCO, says that the couple afforded considerable amusement on account of the disparity ol thvir ages and the naturally ludicrous situations which resulted from such an incongru ous union. The Senator was a gouty i old man of sixty years and upward, and during a long career of fashionable life had partaken of many fine dinners, ? washed down with old .Madeira and Sherry. He, therefore, was in little } condition to meet all the requirements of his young and active wife, she, when he married her, being a young and blooming girl of twenty, the is re membered hero as a beautiful blonde with large blue eyes and magnificent tresses, whose charming manners and exquisite toilets attracted scores of ad mirers from both political and diplomat ic circles. Notwithstanding the dispar ity in their ages and tastes, it is stated that they lived most happily together, as the Senator usually passed his time at the card table w ith a few choice spir its. while she was theqieen of the di aw ing room. It is also stated with considerable amusement that along toward midnight the Senator, feeling the necessity oi re pose lor his aching bones, would sally I into the drawing-room, and after a brief parley persuade the youthful shaver of his j ?y s to consent to retire from the I scene of gaiety. They would leave the ? room together, but would almost inva riably return in a few moments, she hav ing obtained the Senator s consent for one or more rounds in the giddy mazes of the dance, while he would accompany her to the door of the drawing-room and there stand with his arms piled full with her ermine-trimmed wraps. There he would stand until the "wee sma hours" patiently awaiting her return, and when rallied with the rematks of his friends, "Senator, are you ready to go?" with his huge form shaking with laughter and a merry twinkle in his eyo, he would reply ; "Yes; but it is a hard matter to get these young people to abandon the fascinations of the dance.' ; The death of the Senator terminated for the nonce her brilliant career in i Washington, and she retired to 1'rincc ton, N. J., his late home, on a compe tency which he had left her. Here ma ny years passed, her chief social amuse ment being the entertainment ol a few of the students of 1'iinceton College. Upon the election of Representative Kandall to the Speakership of the House Mrs. Thompson returned to the city, she being the sister of Mrs. Kandall and j the daughter ot General Aaron Ward. She occupied palatial quarters in the vi- ' cinity ot ex Governor Sw ami's residence, she and hei maid living in sumptuous st\le in the house ot Mr. Fish when Secretary of State. During her resi dence here she frequently met ex Gov. Swann, who was 3 warm personal Iriend of Speaker Kandall, and it w as not long before it was announced that the vener able ex Governor had offered his hand and fortune to the blushing widow of the late Senator from New Jersey. Their marriage soon i*?llowed, the bride beitict given away by Speaker Kandall, and *" the distinguished party left for Princeton in a special palace car. After oassing the summer at the Governor's seaside villa at Newport they returned to Washington. Mrs. Swann, remembering her social achievements a quarter of a century be fore and not having outgrown her fond ness for society, and desiring to renew with even more gorgeousness her rela tions with the distinguished statesmen, diplomats and military and naval offi cers, induced the ex-Governor to con- j sent to a most elaborate system of en tertainments, and to that end his theu i palatial residence in this city w as exten ded to meet the requirements of this, for hirn, new departure. A magnificent saloon and dining room were added, and the entire building was subjected to a ; most elaborate renovation in the way of ' decoration ami works of art. This was ' accomplished and the residence of the venerable ex Governor of Maryland was regarded as one of the most elegant mansions iu the city. The seasou of entertainment began, and the residence was often the scene of a brilliant assent- j blage ot the moat distinguished people at the capital. No reasoa has been aligned lor the separation other than that ex-Governor Swann was opposed to this style of liv ing, and had entered serious objection to it. This check did not please her | ladyship, and it was soon discovered ili3t coolness existed between them, which the friends and relatives of the j ex-Governor took no steps to interfere with, simply maintaining a neutral posi tion and allowing matters to take their course. Subsequently Mrs. Swann took her departure for Princeton, and the ex Governor left for Baltimore with Mrs. Dr. Carter and her husband, a gentle man of fiue presence and elegant style, aud the accomplished widow of his only son. Last summer, instead of going to Newport, they spent the summer with Dr. Coates at his country residence iu Maryland. The ex -Governor lias now returned to this city, aud is again seen with his elegant turnout bowling along j the avenues and drives of the capital, while his wile remains domiciled at her residence in Princeton. Mrs. Dr. Car ter and young Mrs. Swann will dispense the elegant hospitalities of the ex-Gov ernor's home during the coming winter in a manner more in consonance with the good aged statesman's wishes than was the case last season. * ATlO.Vl I. <.'K A IGK. Hon. \V. G. Wayne, Master ot the State Grange of New York, welcomed the members of the National Grange, held at Canandaigua, New York, on the ll'th of November, in the following beautiful remarks : ? Worthy Master, Br other i and Sisters cf the Xutional Grange : As the representative ot the patrons of New York, it gives us pleasure at this time to tender to you a most cor dial greeting, and In their name wel come you to our State. Coming as you do from all the differeut States in our Union, with one mind and one purpose in view, and that purpose the elevation of the producing people to a higher and nobler manhood and womanhood, to a purer and better social standi ug, to a more dignified and honorable position than we have heretofore occupied it is proper and right that we should give you a hearty aud honest welcome. We know you came here with fra ternal feelings extended to all the differ ent classes scattered over our whole Union, looking not back to the past, but forward to the future, with the further purpose iu view of creating a more per fect uuiou of sentiment and feeling to ward a government that should protect all its citizens alike whether rich or poor, and without regard to location or other surrounding circumstances. Wo kuow you come here from your differ ent States as the representatives of the industrial interests, and that your work while here will be for the better pro tection and advancement of those inter ests, for they are the foundation upon which our government rests, and upon which all alike should prosper. We welcome you, Worthy Master, Brothers and Sisters ot the National Grange at the commencement of this our inclem ent season, with h var ts warmed by sym pathy for the industiiul men and women located in all parts ot our common country, whether on the farm, iu the forest, the work-shops, the mills, or the mines, knowing as we do that should they cease from, active, energetic labor, the wheels of commerce would stop, the government would become embarrassed and the whole country would mourn, for a panic would ensue greater than has ever yet befallen this country. Our government was designed and instituted for tlie express purpose of dealin^out simple justice to all its citi zens alike, and should not be diverted from that purpose, and would not be but for tho spirit of party which now prevails to such an alarming extent as to crush out justice and equity*, and by the selfish greed of the partisans who are entrusted with the duties of legisla tion, the people are robbed that they may retaiu their power and the emolu ments of office. Great and powerful mooied corporations now control our State and National governmental, and unless a change is effectually made, and that speedily, we will all go down under the enormous burdens, that are now be ing imposed upon us. The noble order you represent was none too soon in its coming, and should not now delay action in the right direc tion, for unless some sure means are de vised for consolidating the agricultural strength of this country and directing it in such channels as will break up the partisan rule that now prevails, we. need not the spirit of prophecy to tell us that but few years more will pass before our agricultural and industrial people will be "hewers of wood and drawers of wa ter ' only for the gigantic powers that are now reaching out all over our fair laud, and with the tread of giants fast crushing us out by their insatiate greed. You come here at this time, worthy Patrons, to counsel together and point out the remedy for these evils that are j now weighting us down with burdens greater than we can bear and prosper. And we know you come with bouest purposes, and that you will use your best efforts in planning some remedy that will be effective in awakening our people up to their true intere>ts and in duce them to ask ' our government re spectfully but earnestly to deal out equal and exact justice to its citizens, wherever located, without fear or favor to any one ot them. We have good reason to feel that our great State, the justly termed Empire state, is honored by the meeting here of representatives o? out noble order of l'atrons of Hus bandry, and we welcome you to this, one of our beautiful villages, located upon this, one of our picturesque lakes, and assure you we have many other such villages, and many other sich lakes, surrounded by enterprising far mers who only ask for just laws that will not allow discriminations against them and their business, aud that special favors may uot be granted to other classes and other sections to their detri ment, 1-ut leave all equal in the race of the pursuit of wealth and the common necessities of life, when they will prove by their industry and thrift that they are of real value to the government and society, and well worthy of that foster- | ing care and protection that is now de nied to them. We know we express the sentiuieots of each and everyone of our Patrons and farmers when we again say to each and every one of you, Broth ers and Sisters all, welcome to our j State. Welcome to our home?, and ! welcome to the hearts of the Patrons I we have the honor to represent in this thirteenth annual meeting of our Na tional Grange. l-fr/I 1 I.R 1'KON UA^IU><I"i'o^i Washington, D. C.. ) Dec. 2nd, 1879. f The opening of Congress yesterday was not in any way impressive, and was not as interesting 3s usual. The message of Mr. Hayes and the important reports of Departments had beeu sold iu ad vance to newspapers, and not only Sen ators and Representatives bat the crowd in the gallery were already informed of its contents belore the formal reading commenced. Of the message itself it may be said that there is little in it but routine mat ters. 1* oreign relations are pleasant, the country is pros{>erous, <?c. ' There are two or three subjects treated at length which are of exceptional interest. Mr. Hayes recommended the retire merit of all tie greenbacks. This is not entirely a new recommendation tor a Republican Executive, Graut having asked that in certain cases that the legal | tender quality be takeu from this class of paper, and Secretaries Bristow and j Morrill of Maine favored the complete destruction ot this circulation. But the position of Mr. Hayes on this subject has not been well understood until very lately. Doth he and Secretary Sherman were very reticent until after the Fall elections. Mr. Hayes says much for civil service rtfoim. i his irresistibly reminds one ; of the Vermont man, who, having mur dered his father, spent the rest of his lite praising him. I ntil the incoming of Mr. Hayes and his Cabinet compara tively little was known of the violations of official propriety by occupants of the ' \\ hite House and high government offi cials. Mr. Hayes commenced by get ting Stanley Matthews into the Senate in place ot* Garfield, and has meddled with nearly every political contest that has occurred in Ohio since. His Cabi net officers have stumped the States prodigally. As to what Congress will do, little can be said with certainly. Both par lies will be governed almost wholly by , l,,eir respective caucuses, to beheld this week. Of course the appropriation bills w ill be passed, but I hope with amounts largely reduced from the estimates. I ? wish to repeat what so often has been said, and what is known to every old Washingtoniau, that every Department c osts too much. I believe iu reasona ble salaries, and in plenty of officers to transact the public business. But at present, and for the last fifteen years, at least, we l.ave had too many officers, and employees, and lar too many au thorized ways of squandering public money. No bills were introduced yesterday, and, except under a suspension of tho rules, none can be in the House until next Monday. Mr. Kelly will, howev er, to-day attempt to get before tho House a resolution denying the right of the Kxecutive to coucludo a treaty w hich shall fix rates ot duties ou impor tant articles, l'he bill to create the of fice of Captain-General will be intro duced at the earliest opportunity. Transfer of the Indian Bureau to tho \\ ar Department will be urged at once. This Bureau, as well as others of tho Interior Department, is not believed bv . any one to be efficiently conducted
