WASHINGTON THEATY. When Ccnri- uuj turned in June last, a questi.m bl beeu ruUod by Great Britain, and vm ttieu ponding, which, "for a time, seriously imperilled the settlement by friendly arbitration of the differences exUtinir between this Govern ment and thiit uf Her Britannic Majesty ; the treaty of Washington hud been referred to the tribun d of arbitration whieh had met at Geneva, in Switzerland. The arbitrator?, however, dis posed of the question which hud jeopardized the whule of the treaty, tti.d threatened to Involve the two nation in the mast unhappy relation toward each other, iu a manner mtirely satis factory to tin- Gowriiiucnt, nud iu accordance with tho view nud the policy which It had maintained. The tribunal which lud convened in Geneva iu 1). ceiuber, coucludtd it laborious tesjiuii on !.f 14th day of September last, on which day, !.. nailed it- If of the discre t'anary power t-iven to it by ih- treaty tonwaid a sum iu nrn--. i i d- its dori-iou, whereby it awarded the soui of .-l."i old) (tf)0 iu icold, us thu indemnity tu l c oiidty Great Britain to tho United St i!e. t'i.- thu saiisfacli'iii of all the claims refeiTni tor iis uon-ider tiou.

Tli" r poi i nf tho iient of the Uiiited Stites, appoint.! t utteud the Geneva tribunal, accom panied by the protou.ils of th proccedinia of the couuscl of noih Government ; the award of the tribunal, and the opiuions given by tho several arbitraturs is transmitted herewith. I "n.ivrt caused to be communicated to the heads 1 of the three friendly powers who complied with the joint request made to them under ttie treaty, the thanks of this Government for the appoint- 1 meut of tho arbitrators, made by them, respec tively, mi al3 my thanks to the eminent per sonages named by them, and my appreciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality, and great ability with which they discharged their ardu ous and hitih functions. liar Majesty's Government haseommunicaUd to me its appreciation by Her Majesty of the ability and indefatigable industry displayed by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named on the part of this Government during the protracted inquiries and diHCussious of tho tribunal. 1 cordially unite with iter Majesty in this appreciation. It is due to the aent of the United States before the tribunal, to record my appreciation of the marked ability, unwearied patience, and the pro deno aud discretion with which he has conduct ed the very responsible and very delicate duties committed to him : as it is also due to the learned and eminent couusel who attended the tribunal ou the prt of this Government, to ex press my sense of the talents and wisdom which they bron ir tit to bear in the argument of the result so happily reached. nisiKutuTioN or the awakd. It will be tho province of Congress to provide for the distribution among those who may be entitled to it, of their respective shares of the money to be paid. Although the sum awarded is not payable until a year from the date of the award, it is deemed advisable that no time be lust in makiuur a propsr examination of the sev eral cases in which indemnification may be due. I consequently recommend the creation 01 a Board ot Commissioners. THE SAN J CAN SETTLEMENT. By the thirty-foutth article of the Treatr of Washington, the respective claims of the United States and Great Britain, in their construction of the treaty of the loth of June, 184G, defining the boundary line between their respective ter ritories, were submitted to the arbitration and award of his Majesty, tho Emperor of Germany, which of these claim is most in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty of 1846. His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, haviug been pleased to undertake the arbitration, bus the earnest thanks of this Government and of the people of the Uuited States, for the labwr, paius and cire which he has devoted to the con sideration of this long-peudiug difference. I have caused un expression of my thanks to be communicated to His Majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the representative of this Government at Ber lin, c inducted the c.ise aud prepared the state ment on the part of the United States with the ability that hi past service justified the public in expecting t his bauds. k--ll As a member of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty which ha iven rise to the discussion between the two Governments ; as the Minister to Ortat liritaiu when the construction, now pronounced unfounded, was first advanced, aud as the agent aud repreaentative of the Govern ment to present tho case aud to reotive the awurd, he has been associated with tho question ;., . 1 1 ..f :. .1 if . u ui iic puasos, aim m every staye has luatii- tested patriotic zel and earnestness m the main tetiaiae of the claim ot the United States, he i entitled to much credit for the success which has attended tlie miIuiiUmchi.

This award confirm the I'liitod Slates iu their claim to the important archipelago of il nds lying between the conti nent and Vancouver' Island, which lor twenty six yrs, ever since the ratification of the troaty. Grout Britain ha contested, arid leaves us for the first time in the history of the United States us a nation without a question of dis puted boundary betweou our territory and the possessions uf (J rent Britain on this continent.

I aa grateful to be able to announce that the orders for the removal of troops have bee a executed, and the military joint occupa tion of San Juan baa ceased. The inland are now in exclusive possession of the Uuited State. It now becomi necessary to complete the sur vey and determination cf the boundury line through tho Haro Channel, upon which the commiaeiou, which determined the remaining part of the line, were unable to agree. I rcc commend the appointment of a commission to act jointly with one which may bo nanud by Her Majuety for that purpose. TUB ALASKA. BOUKDABV. The experience of the difficulties attending the delatmioation of our tamiil d line of boun dary, after the occupation of the- territory and iU settlement by tnose owing allegiance to the respective Governments, points to the import ance of establishing, by natural objects or other measurements, tho actual line between tho ter ritory acquired by purchase from Russia and the adjoining possessions of her Britannio Ma jesty. The region is now sn sparsely occupied that no conflicting interests of individuals or of jurisdiction re likely to interfere to the delay or the embarrassment of the actual location of the line. If deferred until population shall en ter and occupy the territory, some trivial con test of neighbors may sgain array the two Gov ernments in antagonism. I, therefore, recom mend the appointment of a commission to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the p irt uf Great Britain to determine tho line be tween our territory of Alaska and the coter minous possessions of Great Bntuin. THE FISHEHIK8. In my last aunu il message I reeommended , legislation necessary on the part of tho Uuited States to bring into operation the Treaty of Washington of May, 1S71, relating to the fL-h-tries end to ither matters touching the relations of the Uuited States toward the British North American possessions, to become operative so souii us the proper legislation should be hud ou the part of Great Britiau und her possessions. That legislation on the part of Great Britain atid its possessions had tot then been had, and durii.g the session ef Congress a question was raised, wLich, for the time, raised a doubt whether any action of Congress in the direction indicated would become important, a question which has since been disposed of, and I tiare re ceived notice that the Imperial Parliament and the Legislature of the Provincial Government have p.fed laws to carry tee provisions of the treaty en the matters referred to iu operatiou. I therefore Teoommend your early adoption of the legislation in the same direction necessary on the part of tbia Government. SOUTHERN BOUNDARY. The Joint Commission for determining the boundary line between the United States and the British Possessions, between the Lake of the Woods and the Rocky Mountains, has organized and entered npou its work. It is desirablu that the force shall be increased in order that tba completiou of the survey and determination of the boundary may be sooner completed. Te this end I reoommeud that a sufficient appropriation be made. FOREIGN RELATIONS. With France, our earliest ally ; Russia, the constant aud steady friend of the Unittd Slates ; Germany, with whose government and people we have so many causes of friendship and so many common sympathies, and the other powers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most friendly terms. Sinoe my last annual message, the exchange Las been made of the ratification ef a treaty with the Aastro-HuBgarian empire relating to natu ralization; also of a treaty with the German Empire respecting consuls and trade-marks ; also of a treaty with Sweden and Norway relating te naturalization, all of which treaties have been duly proclaimed. INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CONGRESS. Congress, at its last session, having made an appropriation, to defray the expense of Commis sioners on the part of the United State to the International Statistical Congress at St. Peters burg, the persona appointed in that character proceeded to their destination, and attended the sessions of the eongress. The report shall, in due ssason, bs laid before yoa. This cougien meets at intervals of about three years, and has held its sessions in several of the countries of Europe. I submit to your consideration the prepriety of extending an invitation to the Con gress to hold its next session in the United States. The centennial celebration to be held in 1S70 would afford an appropriate occasion for such meeting. TUB VIENNA EX POSITION. Preparations are making for the International Exposition to be held during the next year in Vieaaa, on a soale of great maguitude. The tendency of these expositions is the direction ot advanced civilisation and the elevation of in dustry, of labor, and the increase of human hap piness, as well as 01 greater mterceurse aud uood will between nations. As this exposition i to be the first which will have been held in Eastern Europe, it is believed that American inventors and manufacturers will be ready to avail them selves of the opportunity lor the presentation of their productions, if encouraged by proper aid and protejtion, At the 1 .st session uf congress authority was given for the appointment ol one or more agents to repieeeut tni governmeat at the exposition. The authority thus given has been exercised, but in tne abaet.ee of any appro prlation there it danger that the important tene fits which the exposition otfer-, win, in a l .iye degree, be lost to ciuztu et tho Lulled States. I commend the subject strongly to your consid eration, aud reoommeud that au adequate ap iiMpri.itiuB be made for the purpose. To further aid Auterioati exhibitor at tbu Yi ntia Exposition, 1 would roomuied, lu addition nil ppropriatiou of money, that tba Secretary of ibo navy be authorised to fit up two naval vessels to trsusport between our Atlantic cities nud Irteste or the most convenient port to Viun n a, ..nd back, their article for exhibition. OUIt RELATIONS WITH MEXICO. Smce your last sesaiou, the l'resideut of th Mexicaii Republic, distinguished by hi hiuh character and hi services to hi country, has aieu. in temporary successor ha now been elected with uuauiuiity by the neonli', a nroo of oonlideuoe ou their part iu hi patriotism mi l wisdom which, it is believed, will bo confirm 1 by the results of bis Administration. It is particularly desirahhi that nothing should be left undone nr thd vovermnent of either re publics' to strengthen their relations s neighbors and friends. It is inaeh to be regretted that msny lawless acts continue to diaiuro ine quiet of the settle meets on the border between our territory am that of Mexico, and that complaints uf wrong to Atncrieau cimens In various parts of the country are innao. 1 lis (evolutionary condition la wbiuli thu neighboring republic ha so long bsn invol ved, has in some decree contributed to this dl turbanoe. It is to be hoped that with a more sen ma rule ot order throughout the republic wman inay be expected Irotn tae present trov erniaent, the sots of which just complaint is nude win cease. 

TRADER: SA'J UKDAY, The proceeding of the commission under the convention with Mexico of the 4th of July 1868, on the subject of claims, have unfortunately been checked by an obstacle, for the removal of which measures have been taken by the two gov ernmenu, which it i believed will prove suc cessful. The commissioners, appointed pursuant to the joint resolutions of Congress, of the 7th of May last, to inquire into depredations on the Texas frontier, hava diligently made investiga tions in that quarter. Their report upon the subject will be communicated to you. Their researches were necessarily incomplete, partly on account of the limited appropriations made by Congress. Mexico, on the part of that gov ernment, has appointed a similar commission to investigate the outrages.' It is anoouueed uffl cially, but the rresi of that country states that the fullest investigation is desired, and that the co-operation of all parties concerned is invited to secure that end. I therefor recommend that a special appropriation be mado at the earliest day practicable, to enable tho commissioners on the part of the United States to return to their labors without delay. CL'UA. It is with regret that I have again to announce a eontiouance of the disturbed condition of tbe Island of Cuba. No advance toward the pacifi cation of the discontented portion of the popula tion has been made, whilo the inaurreotiou has gained no advantages, and exhibits no more of the elements of power, or of the prospect of ulti mate success than were exhibited a year ago. Spain, on the other bund, has not succeeded in its repression, ana the parties stand apparent ly in tbe same relative attitude which they have occupied to? a long time past. This contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were it seen at a distance from our neighborhood, we might be indifferent to its result, although hu manity could not be unmoved by means of its 1 incidents wherever they might occur. It is, however, at our door. I cannot doubt that the eontinued maintenance of slavery ia Cuba is among tho strongest inducements to tbe contin uanca of the strife, terrible wrong is the natnral cause cf a terrible evil. The abolition in the administration of the government in Cuba could uot fail to advance the restoration of peaoa and order. It is especially to be hoped that the present liberl government of Spain will volun- tarilv sdoDt tbia view. The law of emanc: jP i tion, which wa passed more than two years since, has remained unexecuted iu the absence 01 regulations lor us eniorcemeiu. 11 was uuia feeblei steD toward emanciuation. but it was the recoguitiou uf right, and was hailed as auch, and exhibited Spain iu harmony with tbe sentiments of humauity and of justice, and in sympathy with the ether powers of the christian and civil- ized world. Within the lst few weeks the reg ulations for carrying out the laws of emancipa tion has been announced, giving evidence of the sincerity of intention of the present government to carry into effect the law of 1870. I have not failed to urge tbe consideration of tbe wisdom, tbe policy aud the justice of a more effective system for the abolition of the great evil, which oppressed a race, and coutiuties a bloody und destructive contest close to our border, a well a th Axrcdinrv uii.l tlm instiisAiif ftnnudini reforms, of which the Droorietv is not Question- ed. Deeply impressed with the conviction that me conusance oi ...vrry is one o, memos active causes of the continuance of the unhappy condition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citi- Kens of the United States, or those claiming to oe sucn, are large noiaers in v,uoa o, wa there claimed as proporty, but which is forbid- dsn and denounced by the laws of the United Ststes. They are thus, in defiance of the spirit of our own laws, contributing to the continu- ante of this distress!. and tickenin, ronte.t. In my laat annual message I referred to this subject, and I again reoommend euoh legislation L- J . J it . . rent at least to disoour.ire. American citiz.n. from holding or dealing in slaves. t-t-'MJ fii'AlN AND THE rACiKic itETUitLlCS.

It in a docu ment to Lie commended for its purely business like character, and largely for not containing many things which it might have contained. The President makes no boastful or offensive allusion to his rc-tlection ; he makes no hy pocritical prouiioes of civil service reform, or ot a milder or more lenient policy towards thu South, both inevitably to be broken ; and is prudently dumb on the San Domingo question. Ilia only positive recommendations arc, lir.it, in favor of the quixotic and dangerous elastic currency scheme proposed by Mr. H.mtwc-ll ; and second, in favor of the Niagara ship ca nal, and the appointment of a commission to examine the other cheap transportation schemes that have been proposed to facilitate the shipment of western produce. to the sea board. He endorses Boutwcll's impudent claim of credit for reducing the public debt, while the enormous revenues ot the govern ment rendered such reduction utiaviodable, and that the present rate of reduction of t'e debt may continue, opposes auy reduction ot taxation. 31any other important subjects are referred to, such as increase ot the navy, steamship subsidies, postal telegraphy, and the like; but the President is chary of commit- ting himself to any of them, uu.l contents him 9elf by commending them to the caretul af.cn. tion of congress.
