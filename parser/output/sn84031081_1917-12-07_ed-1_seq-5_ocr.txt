It is the present busi ness of the allies to do their utmost in the interval which must elapse before American forces are effective. It is quite certain that Germany will utilize every moment. "It obviously is her polcy to force a decsion in the next few months and the Germans, being fine soldiers, their leaders being desperate men, ana nnthinir hoinr certain in war, they have at least a sporting chance of success."

HUT.,, 1 tV MONIN JOUNt "CIAL LIID WIHIl Chicaeo. Dec. 6. Arthur Meeker vice nresldent of Armour & Co., today telegraphed the national food admin-. istiation that newspaper articles say ing that he lavored a porkless day, but not beefless and muttonless days, were incorrect. He favored both meatless and wheatless dfiyri, as present observed, he said. The error arose through Mr. MeeM cr's presence at a meeting of livestock commissioners who recommended that a porkless day only be observed. Mr. Meeker exnlalned to the commission ers that a present surplus of meats was fortunate in view of the expecta tion of heavy government purchases. "The aim of my remarks," Mr. Meeker telegraphed, "was to show the slock raisers of the middle west that there should be a good market for all the cattle they can raise for some months to come, due to depletion of the world's stocks as a result of the war. I see every reason why meatless and wheatless days should be strictly enforced." yiiss Frances Lavender of, Iowa Becomes .Instructor in Musie and Art; Comes Well Equipped for the Work,

Vienna's INsliim. Within one month thereafter the imperial and royal government, eoln- tidentally with the German declara tion of February 10, 1916, on the treatment of the armed merchantmen announced that "all merchant vessels armed with cannon for whatever pur pose by this very fact lose the char acter of peaceable vessels" and that under these conditions orders have been given to Austro-Hungarian naval forces to treat such ships as belliger ent vessels. In accordance with this declara tion several vessels with Americans on board have been sunk in the Med iterranean, presumably by Austrian submarines, some of which were tor pedoed without warning by subma rines flying the Austrian flag, as in the cases of the British steamers Be cundo and Welsh Prince. Inquiries made through the American ambassa dor at Vienna as to these cases have so far elicited no information and no reply. Again on January 31, 1917, coin-I cidentully with the German declara tion of submarine danger zones In waters washing the coasts of the en tente countries, the imperial and royal government announced to the United States government that- Aus tria-Hungary and its allies would from February 1 prevent by every means any navigation whatsoevqf within a definite closed area." " 'From the foregoing it seems fair to conclude that the pledge given in the Ancona case and confirmed in the Persia case Is essentially the same as that given in the note of the imperial German government dated May 4, 1916. viz: "In accordance with the general principles of visit and search and destruction of merchant vessels recognized by international law sucti vessels both within and without the area declared as a naval war zone, shall not be sunk without warning and without saving human lives, un less theBe ships attempt to escape or offer resistance," and that this pledge has been modified to a greater or less extent by the declarations of the 1m- ner.al and- royal government oi tea- ruary 10, 1916, and January 31, 1917.

" 'In view, therefore, of the uncer tainty as to the interpretation to be placed upon those declarations and particularly thiH latter declaration It is important that the United State government be. advised definitely and clearly of the attitude of the imperial and royal government in regard to the prosecution of submarine warfare in these circumstances.

"The Austro-Hungarian govern ment also stated that Austro-Hungarian submarine had taken no part In the sinking of the British steamers Secundo and Welsh Prince and that 'tho assurance which It . gave the Washington cabinet in the Ancona case and renewed in the Persia case has neither been withdrawn nor re stricted by its declaration of February 10, 1916, and January 31, 1917.' "The Austro-Hungarian note en deavors through a legal argument to show consistency between these as surances and its declarations. In this way the Austro-Hungartan govern ment nvudes a direct answer to tho American inquiry, biit in its argument It substantially adheres to the dec laration of January 31, 1917, for it states that 'the entire declaration if essentially nothing else than a warn lnf to the effect that no merchant ship may navigate the sea zones ac- ctiBitely derinea in me auciaruuuu ami hllt the Imperial and royal gov ernment is, however, unaoie to ac cept a responsibility for the loss ot human lives which, nevertheless may result from the destruction of armed ship or ships encountered in the Closed zones.' "In view of this acceptance and avowfl by the Austrian government of the nbliiy which had lea to a ra-eacn of relations between the United Slatesland Germany, the government of the!

The Drive Into Italy "Until the present Austro-Oorman drive in northern Italy, the Austrian forces were gradually being driven back by the forces of the Italian army. With tho assistance of German troops drawn from the Russian front, a very serious catastrophe was in flicted on the Italian arms, which, if it had not been stemmed, might have resulted In the collapse of Italy. Such a result would have a great blow to those with whom we are associated In this war and as much to the United States as to any of her co-belligerents. "As a result of this situation the allies have rushed uid to Italy and the United States Is sending ships, money and supplies and will -probably soon send troops, who will be facing and making war on Austrian soldiers. Situation Is Important. "The Itulian situation is one ot the utmost importance in the present con duct of the wur. A declaration of war by the United States against Austria Hungary will hearten the people of Italy, who have been misled by the mlschleyoug and diluting propaganda engineered by Germans. It will strengthen from a military point ot view the whole allied cause. These are strong considerations for a dec laration of war against Austria-Hun- gaiy. 'These considerations and the fact that Austria-Hungary is adhering: to' the illegal and inhumane policy -of ' ruthless submarine warfare and Is, as the committee believes, making- war on American vessels and' American citizens on the high seas, and other reasons which are not deemed neces sary to recapitulate here, Induced the committee to report unanimously the accompanying' resolution declaring that a state of war exists between the Imperial and royal Austro-Hungarian government and tho government and people of the United States and male )ng provision to prosecute the same.
