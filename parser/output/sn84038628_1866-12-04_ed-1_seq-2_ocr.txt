A review is tien madeof the facts set forth in the last messaee. relative to the measures which the executive had taken for the eradual restoration el the southern states to tbe Union, soon as appointing pro visional governors, eto. Only one tbtug tnen remained, the message sajs, to be done, and that was the admission of loyal representa tives to congress. This question was devolv ed solely upon congress, . In the meantime, the President says, no other plan having been proposed, he continued his efforts to perfeet restoration through the judicial, rev enue and postal system of the country. The south had Also ratified the amendment abol ishing slavery ; conformed their social laws to the fact ; repudiated the rebel debt, snd proceeded, in good faith, to legislate tcr tbe amelioration ot the eoiored race. The presi dent then speaks as follows "CcEsress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of these states to representation, and it was cot until the close ot tbe eighth month ot the session that an exception was made in favor of Ten nessee. I deem it a subject of profound re gret that congress has thus tar failed to ad mit to scats loyal senators and representa tives from the other states, where the inhabi tants, with those of Tennessee, had evgsged in rebellion. Ten etates more than one fourth of the whole number remain without representation, Tbe ssats of fifty members of the house, and twenty of the senate, are yet vacant ; not by their own consent ; net by a failure of election, but by the refusal of congress to accept their credentials. Their admission, it is believed, would Lave accom plished much towards the renewal and strengthening of our relations as one people, nd removed serious cause for discontent on the part of the people ot those elate?. . It would have accorded with the great princi ples enunciated in the declaration of Ameri oan independence, that no people ought to bear the harden cf taxation and yet be deni ed the right of representation. It would hare been in coneononoe wits the express provisions of the constitution, that each state shall have at least one representative, and that no state, without its consent, fchail be deprived of equal seffrare ia the senate. These provisions were ictecdeil to secure to every state the right of representation in congress, and so important was it deemed by tbe fraiaera of the constitution that tbe equality cf tbe states shall be preferred in the seriate, that not even by an amendment of the constitution can any ktatc, w ithont its consent, bo denied a voice in that branch of national legislation. It fcas ben as sumed that these sutes, by rebellion, became territories; but all departments cf the govern ment, with great distinctness, refused to sanction trj assumption so incompatible with tbe nature of our republican system, and the professed ob jects of the war. Throughout tbe recent legis lation of congress, the urjeniable fact makes it self apparent that these ten political commoni ties are nothing less than states,' The President then quotes the Crittsnden resolution of 1S51, on the object of the war. and reviews the legislation cf congress, wherein tha etates are recognized ; and also in Mr. Lincoln's proclamation. He then pro ceeds again, as follows : "In tbe admission of senators and representatives from all ot the states, there can be no just grounds of apprehension that persons who are disloyal will he clothed with the powers of legislation, for this eouid not happen when the consti tution and the laws are enforced by a vigi lant and faithful cungrese. Each house is the judge of its own members. A senator, or member, may be admitted or rejected, or his credentials referred to a proper commit tee. It admitted to a seat, it must be cc evidence, satisfactory, that he possesses the requisite loyal and constitutional qualifica tions. If refused admission, and sent to his constituents for want of due allegiance, they are admonished that none bnt persons loval to the United States will be allowed in the councils of the station, and the political pow er and moral influsnoe of congress are thus effectively exerted in the ioterests of loyalty to the government, and fidelity to the Union. Upon this question so vitally affecting the restoration of the Union, and the permanency of our form of government, my convictions heretofore expressed have undergone no change, but, on the contrary, their correct ness has been confirmed by reflection and time, If the admission of loyal members to eats in congress was wise and expedient a year aja, it is no less wise and expedient now. If this anomabus condition is right now if in the exaot condition of these states at the present time, it is lawful to eiolade them from representation I do not see that the question will be changed by the effect of time. Ten yeare bence, if these etates re main as they are, the right of representation will . be no etrjnger, and the light of exclu sion will be no weaker. Tha constitution makes it the duty of the President v recom mend to the consideration of oongreea 

SUCQ measures as he shall deem expedient. I know of no measure more imperatively de manded by every consideration of national interest, sound policy and equal justioe, than the admission of loyal members from the un represented states. It would consummate restoration, renew vigor and stability, allay doubt, induoe emigration, and open new fields of enterprise." - The President eonoludes on restoration by repeating the warnings of others against a consolidated despotism, and does not make the slightest referenoe to the pending consti tutional amendment, nor to the much talked of amnesty and suffrage questions. All be says of zesonstraction I have given verbatim. 

MEXICAN AFFAIRS. The President speaks as follows on Mexi can affairs : "In the month of April last, as congress is aware, a friendly arrangement was made between the emperor of Franco tad the President for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French expeditionary forces. inis withdrawal was to be eaeetea detachments, the first of whh it was un derstood was to leave Mexioo is November, the second in March, the list 1 JNevam ber, 1867. Immediately en : the cosaptetion of the evacuation ht. F reach geveramsnt was to assume the tame attitude ia regard U non-intervention as held by the jr,0verment of the United States. : Repeated assurances have been given by the emperor: since that agreement, that he would complete the pre mised evacuation within the period named, r even eooner. Ik was reasonable to expect that the proceedings thus contemplated would produce a crisis of great political interest in the republic of Mexico. The nswly appoint ed minister of the United State, Mr. Camp bell, was therefore cent forward on Nov. 9, to assume his functions. -It was also thought expedient that he should be attended in Msxioo,'by the -lieu tOBant- general of the United States srnay, with, the view of ob taining such information as might be x im portant to determine the coarse to be pur sued by the United States, in reestablishing and maintaining necessary and proper inter course with Mexico . " s - - - - - - I Deeply interested in the course cf liberty and humanity, it seemed an obvious duty on Our patt to exercise whatever influence we possessed fcr the restoration and permanent establishment ia that ceufitry f a democratic and reoubUoan form, of government, Such was thetwnditien of affairs in" regard loHex- ico, when, on the 22d day of November, of ficial inferasation was received from Paris that the Emperor had some time since decided not to withdraw a detaoarnent of his forces in the month of November, ' according to agreement : but that this decision was made for the nuroose ot withdrawing the whole cf these forces in the ensuing spring. Of this latter determination, however, the United States has received no notice or intimation, and, so soon as information was received from this government, care was taken to make known its dissent to the Emperor of France. I cannot forego the hope that France will re consider the subject, and adopt 6ome resolu tion in regard to the evacuation of Mexico which will conform to the existing engage ment, and meet the expectations ot this gov ernment. - The documents on the subject will be laid before congress. With the evaauation of Mexico by the French, no serious differ ence between France and the United States would remain." OCR 

RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN. Oa oar relations with Great Britain, the President writes as follows : "It is a matter of regret that no considerable advance has been made toward an adjustment of the dif ferences between tbe United States and Great Britain, arising cut of the depredations on our commerce, and other trespasses commit ted during the civil war, by British subjects, in violation of international law and treaty obligations. The delay, however, may be be lieved t have resulted in no small degree from the domestic situation cf Great Britain. An entire change of ministry occurred in that country during tbe last session of parlia meat. The attention of tbe new ministry was called to the subject, at an early day, and there is some reason to believe that it will be oocsidsred in a beooming and friendly spirit. Tte importance of aa early deposi tion ot the subject cnrt be exaggerated. Whatever might be tbe wishes cf the govern ment, it is manifest that good feeling and friendship between the two countries cannot be established until a reciprocity in the prac tice cf good faith and neutrality shall be re stored between tha respective nations." THE 

FENIAN INVASION' OF CANADA. The President then alludes to the fenian invasion cf Canada as a violation of the neu trality laws. and to the proclamation which be issued, and the trial and sentence of captured lenians, and says: "Sa?h representations have been made to Great Briuia tswill, it is hoped, induce judicious amnesty to all ho were engaged ia the invasion." 

COXCLCDIXG REMARKS. After referrrcg briefly to th- annual te ports, and reoommendmg that tbe District cf Columbia be allowed a delegate in congres?, the President concludes as iol.'cw : '-In the performance of a duty imposed bj the consti tution, I have tbus submitted to the repre sentatives of tbe states and the people euch information cf our domestic and foreign af fairs as the public interest may require. Oar government is now undergoing its mott trying ordeal, and my earaess prayer is that the peril may be successfully and final! v parsed without impairing its original strength and symmetry. The ictererts cf tbe nation ere beet to be prometei by tbe revival of fra ternal relations, the complete obliieratica of our past differences, i.nd the inauguration of ail the pursuits of peace. Directing our ef forts to the accomplishment of these fret finds, let us endeavor t-j preserve fcarmcrsy between tbe co-ordinate departments of the government, thtt each, in its proper sphere, may e'rdialiy co-rperate with the other in sh earing h maintenance cf the constitution, the preservation of the Union and the perpet B.lty offree institutions.
