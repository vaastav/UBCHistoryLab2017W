SUCCESSFUL RAILROAD MANAGES, We see that the exhibit of the financial management of the Memphis and Charles ton "Railroad shows that for the past four months the net earnings of that road, un der the management of Capt. Jos. Jaques, have increased one hundred and eighty thousand dollars. This is at the rate of one hundred and forty thousand a year, or equal to six per cent on nine millions of capital. This, be it remembered, is an In crease of net earnings over the previous management. It is a splendid exhibit and shows Capt Jaques to be one of the very first railroad men of the South. OUR WORST ENEMIES. There is a large landholder near one of our ne krhborins towns who owns one thousand acres of fine land immediately surrounding the place. One of its citizens, pointing to it some days ago, said : "There is a snlpndid tract of land, two-thirds of which lies uncultivated. The owner re fuses to sell it and has entailed it to his children as far in the future as our laws wilHpermit. A neighbor. near by hold ing not quite so much, but equally as fer tile land, ispursuiug the same policy." "These men," said our informant, "speak right out and say they don't want immi gration. They propose to hold their lauds and cripple us." The town referred to is partly hemmed in by such farmers and it is scarcely necessary to say that for the last six years hardly a single neAV house has been built. If the exclusive pol icy of the Chineso were carried out and a huge wall built about that place over which immigrants were not allowed to pass, a more ruinous policy could not be pursued. How many such landholders are there in our State? How many men arc there holding three or five times as much land as they can cultivate, which they will not sell and which is now lying idle? Can not people understand that this is a crying evil and one that does more to impede im migration than anything else ? We hear meu cry out for more manufac tories. Just what we all want, we admit. But where is the population to consume the products of your workshops ? A foundry is a poor investment when there is no de mand for engines or machinery. Men do not build manufacturing establishments where there is no thrifty, growiug popu lation to use their products. There must be population before there can be shops. Population is the basis upon which every department of industry or trade must rest. As well try to build a solid massive ware house upon a foundation'of sand as to try to build up a State, or .city, or manufac turing interests without population to sustain them. Of course every industrial enterprise depends some upon patronage from abroad, but un less sparsely populated localities have ex ceedingly rare and peculiar advantages for manufacturing, such enterprises will al ways seek the populated regions. Here 9 A w we have great advantages, but the main dependence of most manufacturing inter ests must be upon local support. If Knox " and adjoining counties bad four times the population they have and this they should have we would have four times our present industrial interests. To come to the root of our present trouble then, we repeat, we must have more pop ulation. To secure this we must force in to market our idle lands. Our farmers who hold twice as much land as they work must sell part of it to good men. Such men as we referred to in the beginning of this article must be forced to sell their land Their Chinese notions are against public policy. They are our worst enemies. They are keeping our people poor and our coun try depopulated. If we had the power we would tax all such lands so high that the S2lfish, miserly owners would be compelled to sell part or them. The industrious far mer now helps pay taxes on these idle lands. His enterprise and capital is taxed three times as much as it would be if all these waste fields were yielding abundant crops through the labors of thrifty immi grants. They can riot fail to see this. This is one remedy for the evil now crippling us, and though it.may not be the best, it is worthy the attention of our Legislators soon to assemble to devise some relief for our embarrassed tax payers. . . 

COMMESIS ON I HE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The comments of the press ou the Presi aenvs message are on tne wnole very favorable. The Isew York Times savs. nothimr could be more plain or business-like and that not in twenty years has a President been able to lay before the people a more gratifying public exhibit. The Herald (Ind.) pronounces it a good message and a valuable State paper, brim ming over with all the vast and multifa rious concerns of the country, at home and abroad. i : ' f ;i V A H : - T A - The Tribune (Ind.) declares that it is a plain, business document,- pressing some mischievous old plans and presenting some naur mioa i t . - The Sun (Dem.) thinks it common-place and conspicuously encourajriDjr every measure looking towards centralization. The World (Dem.) thinks the message does not show the President far-sicrhted. It pronounces hia recommendations as "gathering up the tail ends of spent ques tions." The Philadelphia Press says : No words of ours need be added in praise of the message, which is simply a calm review of the nation's history in the last year, and a clear statement of its necessities in the next from the President's standpoint. me Missouri ucmocrat says: it is a plain, straightforward, business-like pa per, comprehensive in its scope, and going sufficiently into detail to convince the peo pie or the nation that President Grant is an honest, faithful and pains-taking guad ian of the public interests. The Chicago Inter-Ocean says of it : It is marked by that straightforwardness of statement which has characterized all the messages and public acts of President Grant, and adds to his reputation as a cau tious, shrewd, far-seeing statesman, who gains strength as he gains experience, and giving promise of entering upon his second term with deservedly largely increased popularity among all classes of thejpeo- ple.
