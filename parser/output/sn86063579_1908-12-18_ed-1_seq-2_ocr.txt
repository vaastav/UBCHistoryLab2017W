Bryan feda that he is called up on to save his country rather than SüUlá. Congress is in full sway and ftatehood for New Mexico looks exceedingly bright. The El Taso Times is rapidly growing into one of the best and most relk'.Me daily papers in bijr old Texas. Splendid improve ments have recently been made in the paper. The Fanama canal continues to be a warm number. It is not at all surprising that several tons of dynamite have just pone off down there simultaneously -and then some. Quite a few papers in the ter ritory are losing sleep over a new name for New Mexico when she becomes a state. The Graphic will be delighted with any old name if we get Ftatehood. New Mexico is good enough for us. We are reminded that a rose would be just as sweet with any other name. Says President Roosevelt in his message just out: "I advo cate the immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states. This should be done at the present session of the Con gress. The people of the two territories have made it evident and I trust that this will be done without delay." If such an unlocked for thing that Delegate Andrews don't get us statehood should happen, we hive at least the happy consola tion of knowing that he is the only man on earth who could have come within a mile of gel ting it. However, we look fur the man who "does things" to push her through at the present short session. The one feature of the Christ mastide that cannot be overdone is the giving of comfort to the needy. Sometimes it appears that the custom of exchanging gifts has its questionable side, in the increasing demands upon Blender purses and the cultiva tion of a spirit of mendicancy in servitors. These matters, how ever, regulate themselves, and probably little harm is done by the swelling of the spirit of gen erosity at this holy time. But the relief of the poor and un fortunate is blessed work that can never work injury to him who gives. A Mr. F. M. Tarter, of Rich Hill, Mo., wants a place under the incoming administration. Although he has his first and sacond choice as to the plums he would like to have bestowed, he does not confine himself to eith er of those or nothing. He ha3 written a letter to a friend, prominent in politics, soliciting aid in landing what he most de sires. In that letter he expres ses a decided preference for the fish and game wardenship. He says in his communication, how ever, that "if that place is promised, state mine inspector will do. If that place is also promised, then any old slice will do-anything, in fact, to keep me from digging coal in my old days." The letter has been re ferred to Attorney General Had- leyby the gentleman who re ceived it. Trouble for Postal BUL It looks now as if a thorny path confronts the postal sav ings bank bill. When Senator Carter secured a special order to take up this measure it is said he had pledges of sufficient votes to'pass the bill h the senate. The situation seems to have changed and at present it is doubtful whether Senator Carter can rally anywhere near the required number. In fact, it is stated that he will fall short a dozen votes on the Republican side. This change of front has been brought about by investigations conducted abroad by members of the National Monetary Com mission, who reported adversely to he establishment of postal savings banks. Several members are now on record in favor of the govern ment keeping out of the bank business rather than engaging in this new policy. Chairman AUrich u ready to take a positive stand against the passage of the bill and will have the support of a large number of senators because of the op position of small bankers throughout the country. The position is taken that these small banks in many instances would be driven out of business by the postal banks, and in view of the strong opposition arising the prospect is that no vote will be obtained on the postal savings bank bill at any day in the im mediate future. Cattle barons, whose ranches in the west are gradually bein? cut up for agricultural purposes, are investigating Mexican lands with regard to advantages they oiTe for the raising of cattle. Consul Griffith, of Tampico, reports thai the cattle rangers have been vir tually forced to look elsewhere for a cattle country, and they have discovered that cattle can be raised at less expense in Mexico and also that there is an advantage to cattlemen in in land and water transportation facilities for shipment to the United States. The climate, grass and water and general to pography is taid to be we adapted to animal growth and comfort. Work as a Medicine. One of the most noticeable things among the unemployed is the rapidity with which they age. The more delicately adjust ed a piece of machinery is, the quicker it rusts out and goe3 to ruin when not running. Whea the mind is not health fully employed and constantly exercised it ruins itself very quickly. There are many in stances in history where great men, when deprived of liberty, when their employment was taken away from them, very quickly went to pieces. They were unable to sustain the shock. Statistics show that great men tal workers are, as a rule, long lived. Activity is conducive to longevity. There is nothing like having plenty of work, something to look forward to constantly, something to plan for, think for, live for. There is nothing more fatal to growth and normal liv ing than the monotony which comes irom mental inaction, nothing more fatal to growth han stagnation. There are a great many semi- invalids in this country today who could probably be cured by the right kind of work, mental or physical, because they are in valids mentally because they are physically.
