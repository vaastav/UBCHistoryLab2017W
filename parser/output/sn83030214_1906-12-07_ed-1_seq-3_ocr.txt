jfEED OF BATTLESHIPS lEPORT OX THE NAVY. Jir. Bonaparte Suggests Reorgani zation of His Department. XTashlattor., Dec. 6.— Secretary Bonaparte of the ssWT Department, in his annual report, which was ga.6e T*blic to-day, suggests plans for a general re (jjar.:i of the department, and recommends an tjcrease in the strength of the navy in battleships. Oa t:^« sol it of reorganization he says: •».$ work of the department should be grouped fcto"four sections, one under the immediate direr jr oa cf the Secretary, another under that of the Asi'snast Secretary, anil the remaining two under c*»ccrt of flag rank. Of the last mentioned two sietioas, or.« should be intrusted with the duties row imposed npon the bureaus of yards and docks. tcrpcatDU construction and repair, steam engl reer:r.g cr.d ordnance, and the officer at its bead •'-a-'ld have ac a.*!«istant3 the chief constructor, ti:# er-siaaer in chief and two officers not now de« i^»X£, !:. tha law, for whom I suggest the titles ft lister of oriir.:.noe and master of public works, ♦he las' mentioned tj be a civil engineer of the ,* av v.

Regarding the need of battleships Mr. Bonaparte says : I may note the frequency with which new types or structures have i»een thought destined to make battleships obsolete. This was first expected of automobile torpedoes, then of torpedo draft, then of submarines, and. lately, oven of dirigible bal loons. Experience has indeed indicated that all of tne.«e several inventions, except the last, may have a legitimate, although very circumscribed, eld of utility in modern naval warfare, but I feel that I ought to place on record in this connection th* con viction of the department that the only trustworthy safeguard for our country against injury from a hostile battleship Is to have at leapt one American battleship ready to deal with her. ARMOR PLATE CONTRACTS. The situation arising from the bids for armor plate. In which, Mr. Bonaparte says, there were indications of a combination to maintain a high price, is dealt with. Concerning its correction, the following recommendations are made: There are only two ways in which It 1h practica ble to control such a situation: either the govern ment must be authorized to manufacture its own armor plate or It must be permitted to buy this abroad. I recommend that both privileges be ac corded to the department. The first mentioned of them would be. however, probably Ineffectual. ... If. however, the Secretary of the Navy were authorised to buy armor plate abroad whenever, in the Judgment of the President, the price at which he could obtain such armor plate In the United States was exorbitant or unreasonable, there is good reason to believe that the manufacturers would either rot form a combination at all or agree upon a reasonable and moderate price. I would extend the like authority to the purchase of tor pedoes, ammunition, projectiles and, in fact, all articles n-ceasary to the national defence. It is evident that such articles stand on a totally dif ferent footing from such ac are manufactured only for private consumption. The government has the constitutional right, a right inherent in its sov ereignty, to take, by the exercise of its power of eminent domain, any art!cl«» necessary to the na tional defence and already In existence, upon pay- Ing- for it a reasonable price. When citizens of th« United States, enjoying the protection of Its laws, who are engaged In the manufacture of articles of this character, refuse to manufacture, them for the government unless it shall agree to pay for them an exorbitant and un reasonable price, they evidently defraud it of an opportunity to exercise Us Just constitutional pow ers and evad«» the fulfilment of their own duties as patriotic citizens. Therefore, whatever may be the general economic policy of the government, the markets of ihe world ought to be open to It in dealing with the situation thus created. 

SCHEME FOR PERSOXXEL. Board's Plan Provides for More Of ficers and Regular Promotion. Washington. Dec —"An examination of the navy list discloses a condition of affairs under the pres ent law that seriously affects the efficiency of the service and constitutes a grave menace, if .not a positive danger to the public interests." This statement rums up briefly the decision of the navy personnel board under the presidency of Assistant Secretary Newberry. The board was ap pointed last August to jnggest such modifications la the law affecting the commissioned personnel of the navy as might seem to It advisable. The board's recommendations offer a remedy for two serious evils in the line, namely, the absence of opportunity for officers of flag rank to b»come familiar by actual experience with their duties as commanders of fleets, divisions or squadrons In the short time between their promotion and their retirement for age. and also an impending period of great stagnation In promotion. As an illustra tion of what is likely to happen, the board says that unless Congress ta.k<--s immediate action the lower grades of the service ■will become so con gested that a midshipman now in one of the lower classes at Annapolis may possibly not be promoted to lieutenant until he is between forty-five and fifty years eld. This situation is brought about by the fact that Congress has authorized a considerable Increase la the number of midshipmen at the Naval Academy, and these midshipmen on graduation are promoted to ensign and lieutenant (Junior grade), but no provision was made for a corresponding in crease in the upper grades. The details of the board's scheme have been care fully worked out as to the minimum number of officers required for the fleet, the number of officers In each grade, the length of time to be spent in each, and the amount of eea service required in each grade, all betas based upon the experience of years and upon modern requirements. The scheme is automatic in its action, being constantly regu lated co that there are no sudden flights of promo tion nor long- periods of service in one grade. The board regards it as of the utmost Importance that there should be pee vice-admirals and twen ty-one rear admirals on the active list, the vice admirals to be increased la number by one for every Increase of the personnel by eight thousand. The active list of the Una officers, it Is recom mended, should consist of a sea-going list of fifteen hundred officers below flag rank, plus those carried as additional numbers. The present list, it is de clared, should be increased accordingly by not more than seventy-five numbers annually, in addition to the vacancies normally created during the year, until the total number en the sea-going list be at tained. The rnpnrt also recommends the formation of a reserve Hat. of officers for shore duty, with the pay and allowances r.ow given to officers on shore duty. In order, however, to prevent an excess cf officers upon the reserve list beyond the requirements of the duties which they are to perform, It is recom mended that an officer who is transferred to th« reserve list should be r.-Mr--.l on three-fourthß pay in one cradle higher than he holds when placed on the reserve list. It further is recommended that lieutenant commanders transferred to the reserve list be allowed to retire voluntarily as such on half pay of grade, at the discretion of the President. » 

REJECT OFFER OF INCREASE. New Bedford Operatives Want 10 Per Cent, Instead of 7 1-2. New Bedford. Mass.. Dec. 6.— The New Bedford Textile Council to-night voted to recommend to the various unions timt the off» r of the Cotton Manufacturers' Association to advance wages 7*i l*r cent on Monday next ba rejected. Special meet ing* of the unions will be held Saturday afternoon to act upon the recommendation, ami a meeting of the Textile Council will be held Saturday night to itceive the ::i*tructl'<nH of th« unions. Last month the Textile Council requested thai an advance of 10 per cent t«3 granted In all th« .-,"i!. mills of the city by December 10. As the Fall Etlver operatives were successful In their demand for v 10 per cent Increase, the New Bedford Textile Council holds that the local manufacturers should put Into effect the same rate of Increase. It la thought that the unions will accept the re<- ommende.tl in of the Textile Council, but at this time a strike In the event of a refusal by the manu facturers to give 10 per cent in not looked for. The local cotton mills employ about seventeen thwusttn<j hands. WILL SIXTY-SEVEN WORDS LONG. August* J.

David Noble. Augustus Holtio. Frank Bennett, Mlohaal f'lark. Robert Pierson and Halsey Van Horn. The omission of tho name of Inspector Samuel Archibald -was explained by his application for retirement under the pension art. The exemption of Detective Sergeants Ke»nan and Prescott, of the headquarters staff. was not explained, but It was hinted that they might he ■tvitnesses. The board did not appoint any one, to tak» Chief Murphy's place, but announced that the uffairß of the department would be managed by F^rgear.t James Hopkins, who was made acting Inspector, and will be the superior of Captains John Kelly, John-. Cody. Thomas Xugent jand Charles Harrington. J The remarkable shake-up of the department and deposing of its heads followed formal charges mai:o by Mayor Fagan to receive which the Police Board was convened In special ses sion. The anticipated sensational developments attracted such a vast throng of citizens that the Police Board, to accommodate the crowd of epectator*, held Its meeting In the district court room, as Its own quarters were Inadequate. Intense feeling was manifest. Police Commis sioner Mitchell, an organization Republican, when the charges were read and the decree of suspension was moved, entered a protest. He declared it was a political movement, and said: "I know It Is useless to protest, for you havo got to do as you're told." President Potts sharply retorted: "1 sm not Influenced by politics nor will I do the bidding of any one. Serious charges have been made and suspension is Justified. But these officers shall be accorded a fair trial, and I shall. In voting for the verdict, be guided solely by the evidence." Whin the meeting closed there was a remark able demonstration. Cheers were given for Chief Murphy, and were repeated In the corridors. Mayor Fapan's determination to reorganize the Police Department has b^en known in the inner circles for a long tlmp Several months ago the movement was palpable, when Chief Murphy was summoned before the Police Board, presumably to explain an act of alleged In subordination, as he had been quoted as having said that "politics was driving the Police De partment to Hades." Tha chief said he had not be<»n properly quoted, but it was evident that the foundation was being laid f<>r the charges. The Mayor advocates the dismissal of the accused officers. H« declared emphatically in his communication that they were either dis honest or Incompetent, and recommended the suspension pending" trial by the board. 

WATERWAYS CO Speaker Cannon Warns It Not to Expect Too — $50,000,000 a Year Wanted. Washington. Dec. The appropriation by Con press of at least $50,000,000 annually for the Im provement of the rivers and harbors of the country was urged In speeches delivered before the Na tional Rivers and Harbors Convention, which as sembled here to-day for a two days' session. At the morning session addresses were made by Harry D. Goulder, president of the congress; Speaker Cannon and Representative Burton, chair man of the House Committee on Rivers and Har bors. Mr. Cannon warned the delegates not to ex pect too much from Congress, "for." he said, "too much cannot be done at one time. Do the most important thing first, and concentrate upon It, and then take up the next most Important thing." Mr. Burton said that the convention should not ask lor appropriations from Congress for any particu lar community, but for the greater projects of the country- He thought less should be spent on the navy and more for Improvement of the rivers and harbors of the country. At the afternoon session speeches were made by John Barrett, the American Minister to Colombia- John Fitzgerald. Mayor of Boston; Bird S. Col«r, J. S. Teal, of Portland, Ore.; W. G.

Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 6. — Commenting on President Roosevelt's message, W. J. Bryan said that there was much that was good and much that was bad In It. but It may be regarded as th» President's most important state paper. Mr. Bryan says: The message contains much that Is democratic and for which the general public may well thank him. It contains some things that ought to arouse severe criticism. The President boldly approprt ateg some of the doctrines which, the Democrats have been advocating, and. on the other hand, he announces some doctrines which ar« so absurd as to excite amusement if the suggestions came from a less prominent source. In some cases he takes advanced ground; in some cases he retreats from ground already taken. Mr. Bryan complains that what the President says on government by injunction will not be satisfactory to the laboring m«*a or those who respect the right of trial by Jury. The President's stand on child labor, the eight hour law and tho right of the people to criticise a judge la com mended. 

GRESS MEETS. On President Roosevelt's reference to the Jap anese question. Mr. Bryan says:' He pays a deserved tribute to' the progress of the Japanese nation and a.-i'ta fur legislation which will enable Congress to protect the treaty rights of foreigners. That th*>-» should be such legislation eaai-ot be disputed generally, but a great deal de pends upon the character of the legislation. If t-ny bills are presented in regard to this suggestion they must be carefully scrutinized lest they deny to the states thr» right to protect themselves ami their people in matters purely local. Finally, .Mr. Bryan deplores what he calls the President's warlike attitude. He says: There win be general disappointment at tt. war lik»- tone of his message where he Uiscusses the army and the navy. He speaks of the luivy as the surest guarantor of peace which this country pos sesses. Shame upon the Chief Executive, that tie should place an instrument of brute fores above tha nation's sense of justice as a guarantor of peace! The best guarantor of peace is our na tion's principle to deal Justly with oth>?r nations. War ought to be a last resort not a hrst consid eration. It. is bad enough to have a few profes sional soldiers. It Is not necessary thai the -whole nation shall be keyed up all the time to the tight ing point. 

SETH LOW ON "COTTON." Speaks fore Commercial Club of Montgomery, Ala. Montgomery, Ala., Dei I Setl Low, former Mayor of New York. spokt* before the Commercial Club of this city last night. In commenting on the growth of cotton manufactures in th« South, hf! said In part : Then has been, a.* y«">u know, a large trade with China in Pepperell ilrills and sheetings for the better part of a century, hut up to the time 1 speak of the brands exports:] to me East r-oui.i have been counted on your lingtrs. The mill owners very frankly told roe that they would till. in. ;t; t commis sion, any order that wo might give, but that the* would riot manufacture for a market so remote when they nad a market so much better at home especially, they would not agree to pack the gooils or to make them, except upon commission |n any form that would render them unavailable ■,. the market here. In tho interval, my understanding Is that a very large trade baa grown op with China In cotton goods manufactured In the South. I ;,,. pose that, in the first Instance, when the South was searching for a market, tho market abron.it was aa good as * market u.t home. The Srst result of that old experience was to make th.- understand that if in America we want to command a foreign mar ket for anything w« must study the needs of that market and conform to them as fur as possible Our trade with the Orient both in, cot! and In cotton goods ought to be very large, and the South ought to have a constantly Increasing share of the trade In the manufactured, article. When tho Panama Canal is opened tne South will be still moTe advantageously situated, and It only remains for the United States to Bee that the door for commerce is not shut, either -by others or by our selves. Speaking of education, Mr. Lowe said: In the city of New York we know what it is to be called upon to provide education for a vast army of children, many of whom cannot even speak the English language. In the lust four years I suu pom the city has appropriated not far from I4G.UUO.OUO for new school buildings alone to pro vide for this arm/ of children. But New York is the point at which the wealth of the nation Is largely centred, and it 13 hardly too much to ear that th« nation Itself is working through New York City to Americanize and to educate th« children of the immigrant. What the wealth of the Unit.*! States is doinjr locally, throujh the city of New Xork.
