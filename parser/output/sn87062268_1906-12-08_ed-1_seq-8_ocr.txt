REESE CO EVERYTHING TO WEAR 1H f t V J t f 4 I Va4 f X t K S I OPPOSITION TO FRE tT SEED DISTRIBUTION V it II Matter Will Probably Be Thrashed Out Again By Congress MANY REASONS ADVANCED WHY I GOVERNMENT SHOULD CEASE I EXPENDING MONEY FOR THIS PURPOSE AND DIVERT FUNDS TO MORE VALUABLE WORK By William Wolff Smith Washington Dec 7Whlle it is not expected that the house of repre sentatives will devote a week to dis cussing the question ot whether the government should continue distrib uting pumpkin and squash seeds as It did last session the matter will no doubt again come before that body when the agricultural appropriation bill is considered Last session the house committee on agriculture which had considered the matter very care fully reached the conclusion that as the government had been distributing the same varieties of seeds for many years and that all the seeds sent out I have been on the market for from ten I to fifty years and could oe purchased at any seed store the farmers had been well educated as to the charac teristics of those seeds and it was a I waste of money to spend 242000 annually In distributing such common varieties of garden seeds The committee also took cognizance j of the fact that the seeds were dis tributed through the mails and entail I ed a burden on the postofflce depart ment and also considerable expense I estimated at from fifty to two hun dred and fifty thousand dollars per annum The committee omitted the Item for seed distribution but it was reinserted by the house of represen I tatives by a vote of 153 to 83 after a debate which raged for nearly a week i I One of the strongest objections made I to the omission of the item was that the committee had acted without any one appearing before it to object to the distribution This was explained I by the fact that altuough the seed I dealers had objected to the distribu I tion for many years they had no inti mation that the committee would take action on the subject and there fore did not appear before it I When the point was raised It was of course too late to make represen tation to the house committee but a large delegation appeared before the senate committee and as a result of that hearing it reported that a distinct majority was opposed 10 the plan of free seed distribution and hoped at this session to be able to make a sat isfactory change In order that those opposed to free seeds shall have an opportunity to present their case to the house committee on agriculture that committee has granted them a hearing on December 12th at which the entire matter will be very I care fully gone into The anti free seed movement has the support of the National Grange National Farmers Congress and other national state and local organizations 01 farmers to gether with the horticultural socie ties both state experiment stations and agricultural colleges It is unnecessary to remark that the American Seed Trade Association the Wholesale Seedsmens League and all associations interested in the seed trade are also opposed to this distri bution The seedsmen take the ground that this government is the only one that gives away anything in competi tion with private enterprise and that I the only thing given away is the com monest varieties of cheap garden seeds and therefore the congression al free seed distribution is an un justified interference with a private legitimate business The farmers pro test that while this appropriation Is made ostensibly for their benefit there are mills of packets that are burned or otherwise destroyed or are distributed to merchants bankers mechanics laborers and others who can not possiblY have any interest in them They also maintain that as they are perfectly familiar with the varieties of seeds distributed they can learn nothing from them and as they are distributed In pennyweight packages the amount received is too small to justify the majority of the farmers In planting them They there fore contend that this money should be turned over to the department of ag riculture for use with the state ex periment stations In developing new i rare and valuable seeds and plants of both domestic and foreign origin whose adaptability to the locality can be determined by the experiment stations Some of them think a part I of the money can be properly em ployed In developing superior breeds of hogs sheep cattle and even horse If their proposition were adopted the department would have from five to ten thousand dollars annually avail I able for additional work with each of the experiment stations and this idea I strongly appeals to the experiment stations and agricultural colleges As no one except a few members of con cress has appeared to defend the dis tributlon of pumpkin and squash seed and as the entire agricultural press and ninety per cent of the daily press has been attacking this distribution for years there is reason to hope that congress will at last do away with it at the present session There will be presented to the house committee a series of interesting ex hibits One will be approximately one thousand packages of these seeds which were rescued from a bon fire on Long Island last summer They show the franks of the members of I congress to whom the seeds were al lotted and testimony will show that none of the varieties was less than ten years old and some had been on the market for from thirty to fifty years Anti free seed resolutions will also be presented from the National Grange National Farmers Congress Louisville Board of Trade Board
