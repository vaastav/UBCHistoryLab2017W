HOME AND SCHOOL. Parents and Teachers Meet and Discuss Matters of Import ance to Doth. A good sized audience of parents mot at the Nelson Dewev school last Friday evening in response to an invitation sent by the principal and teachers of the school through the pupils. After a very pleasing musical number by Mr. Gra ton Mason, Mr. Whitney was in troduced and gave a very helpful talk, lie made a plea for both a practical and a culture education. Mr. Thomas G. Alvord made an inspiring speech on what the school may be expected to do for the child. Mrs. Geo. L. brooks spoke of tiie need of care in surround ing the children with the right health conditions. The home training of the child was discussed by Miss Corkery and Mr. A. D. S. Gillette. Miss Cork ery read an excellent paper, w hich, by unanimous vote of the audience, is printed in this issue of the Times. This paper should, in the words of a promi nent citizen, “be printed, and read by every parent and committed to heart.” Mr. Gillette’s talk was a verv thought ful setting forth of the force of habit, the need of considering the rest of the school as well as the pupil involved in any particular case of discipline. Judge Roberts spoke of the necessity of parents keeping children oil from the streets and brought the meeting to a point bv introducing a set of resolu tions calling upon parents to keep the children otf from tiie streets, and upon police officers to send children home. After the meeting adjourned the rooms were all thrown open and light ed and each teacher held a reception in her room. It was voted by all a most inspiring meeting, and the desire for more was quite universal. Miss Coikery’s paper on the “Rela tion of Home and School” will be found on the second page of this issue. Spice r-I'arming Opening. The grand opening of the “Big Store” on Monday evening was a little the big gest affair in tiiat line ever attempted by any house in Superior. To do jus tice to the event would take columns of space. Of course everybody was there and the crowds who couid not get into the building were well paid for the trip hv beautiful window displays. Inside the scene was one of beauty far sur passing any former holiday opening of that store. The thousands of incandes cent lights and the hundreds of thous ands of dollars’ worth of goods dis played in every shape and form known to the decorators’ art, with Muhlbaur’s full orchestra in attendance, made a magnificent picture, and no one who was there could have gone away with out being impressed with the magni tude of the institution.

WASHINGTON LETTER. From our Rospilnr Correspondent. Washington, Dec. 11th, 1599. President McKinley lias taken occa sion to congratulate the republican members of the House for their prompt ness in dealing with the financial bill, debate upon which opened in the House today to continue for one week. This bill will not only receive the vote of every republican in the House, but it will get from ten to fifteen democratic votes, making its passage by a large ma jority certain. Never before has there been such unanimity in favor of a fin ancial measure. The reason may be found in the fact that this bill has the approval of the business sentiment of the country. So far, the democrats have shown themselves to be afraid of the bill as a whole, confining themselves to attacking it in spots. They may work themselves up into attacking it more directly as the debate progresses. They will he given every opportunity, and if they wish more time than has been al ioted to them, they can easily get it, as the republicans will be perfectly w illing to give them a part of their time. Gen. Leonard Wood will return to Cuba this week and resume his duties as Commander of the Santiago district. If he knows that his nomination to be Major General of Volunteers, sent to the Senate last week, was a preliminary step toward making him Military Gov ernor of Cuba, as many believe, he keeps the Knowledge to himself very discreetly. But discretion is one of his strong points. 11 Senator Mason expected his speech on the resolution of sympathy for the Boers, offered by him last week, to create a sensation, he is a disappointed man. Senator Burrows has presented Pres ident McKinley, a petition signed by tbe Hollanders of Michigan, asking that he use his good offices to bring about The Finest Line of

Hon. John Barrett, late U. S. Minis ter to Siam, said, in a lecture on “The Philippines and the Far East,” deliv ered under the auspices of the National Geographic Society: “If I were asked to state the necessary immediate influ ences that will assist in making America forever the paramount power of the Pacific, I would enumerate in order of importance: First, permanent sover eignity over the Philippines; Second, construction of the Trans-Isthmian Canal; Third, Preservation according to the Treaty of our trade rights throughout all China; Fourth, Laying of the Pacific Cable; Fifth, upbuilding or reasonable subsidizing of onr mer chant marine; Sixth —anew but import ant proposition—the extension ot a par cel post system of mail to the far East to compete with similar European sys tems, and seventh, the early sending of a Commission to fully investigate and report on Asiatic markets, as recom mended in the President’s message.” With the exception of the Sixth, the President anticipated every one of Mr. Barrett’s suggestions, in ids annual message to Congrtss. One of the most important commit tees of the present House, will be the Insular Committee, which will have charge of all legislation pertaining to the Island possessions of the United States, the formation of w hich has been authorized by the House.
