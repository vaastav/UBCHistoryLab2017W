MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 18C0 The session of Congress which opens this morn ing will, we hazard little in saying it, be the most important that has ever been held within the walls of the Capitol at Washington. It is conceded on all hands tlwt the agitation which p rvades the country, must be quieted by a speedy and perma nent settlement of tbe slavery question. The two great sections of the UNION have been irritated against eaeli other to a degree beyond which ill-feel ing cannot go without leading to an open rupture ; and their representatives are standing face to face upon the spot where the dispute will, in all likeli hood, be brought to a close one way or the other. Within a few short months, or it may he weeks o r days, a reconciliation will have been effected, and we will be still citizens of one of earth's most powerful, free aud prosperous nations, or the glorious Re public which has for eighty-four years challenged the world's admiration aud respect, will be a shat tered and prostrate ruin. It is no wonder, then, that the people of America await so anxiously the action of the body whose course is to influence for all timeto come the destinies of this continent,if not of the human race. Otir own expectations about the result of the session are not, we confess, of a cheerful character. Our hopes, however, are those which are shared by the honest and patriotic men of every section, aud we will not, until tbe last moment, abandon tbe idea of their realization. We have before us a copy of tbe official journal of Lima, the Peruana , of October 2Gth, containing the concluding correspondence between Mr. CLAY and the Peruvian Government, and the circular of thelatter to the diplomatic body, in regard to the controversy which has resulled in a suspension of diplomatic relations between the UNITED STATEJ and the Republic of Peru. We have already ex pressed, at some length, our views in regard to the merits of this dispute, and we cannot refrain from reiterating our regret and mortification, that the Executive of the Union has seen fit to deal with it in the spirit and upon the principles which have brought it so peremptorily to its close. Between maintaining and enforcing the just rights of our citizens—at every hazard and in every shape—and throwing the weight of our national power into th e scale of every claim, which speculators and adven turers from among us may set up against weaker nations, there is a distinction as obvious as it is Just. We had hoped that the disreputable and humiliating result of the Paraguay job had opened the eyes of Mr. BUCHANAN to the necessity of regarding that distinction a little more closely in the future, and that it would be some time be. fore this Government would again compromise its position among nations, by pledging itself, its national resources and character, to the enforce ment of pretensions, either wholly destitute of foun dation in good faith, or open to reasonable doubt or suspicion. As we have said, on a previous occasion, tlie whole matter which lias set the two nations at va riance, is the claim made upon Peru by theowner 3 of.two American vessels, the " Georgiana" and "Lizzie Thompson," which were captured in Feb rnary, 1858, by a Peruvian vessel of war, while engaged in violating the laws of that country, and were duly confiscated, with their cargoes, by the competent, tribunal, in pursuance of the statutes which they had so violated. 11 happened at the time that the rebellion of VIVANCO, (and not of ECHENIQUE, as the New York Times supposes,) was in progress. The revolutionary party having seized upon the guano deposits, which are national property, had commenced disposing of guano, at the lowest prices, to all comers,, and the two ves sels in oiifstion lim-iiior lin ... il.o pose, by the revolutionary officers or their agents, were iu the act of being loaded with guano for exportation, when they were discovered and seized. That they were deliberately violating the laws o' the Republic is conceded. Those laws lind been published long before; had been officially commu nicated lo lliis Government, and had by it been promulged, in executive reports, to Congress and the people at large. That they were well known to the masters of the vessels in question is not de nied, and that those vessels and their cargoes were confiscated, in conformity with the legislation which they had thus treated with contempt, is fully conceded. It is contended, however, by our Government—and the whole controversy turns upon the aigument—that the revolutionary forces had inaugurated a government clc facto at the points where the vessels were captured, and that the ship-masters had a right to deal with such a government and under it, and had acquired rights by such dealing, which the government de jure could not subsequently divest, without a violation of international law. Such is the substance of the opinion of Mr. Attorney General BLACK, un der whose advice the course of ilie administration has been taken. The question raised by this opin ion is a mingied one of fact and law, and it seems to us as plain as day, that the doctrine of the At torney General cannot staud a moment's scrutiny, in either point of view. First—ns to the question of fact. Was there a goyernment defacto under the revolted officers, at the points where the vessels were taken? A gov ernment de/ac(o is one which is actually govern ing within a particular jurisdictiou. Its whole authority and legitimacy are centred in the single fact of its ability so to govern. Whenever and wherever it lacks the physical power, or fails to maintain and enforce its authority—then and there it ceases instantaneously to be any government at all. Now it is simply absurd—we respectfully submit—to contend in the case before us, that the rebel authorities were exercising any such power as made them a government tie facto, at the localities in question, when the seizure of the vessels was made, in spite of them, within those identical lo calities, by the cruiser of the government de jure. Beyond all peradventure, the latter government was also the de facto government, tor the time, at those points; for the capture of the vessels demon strates that it had the power, within those locali ties, and notwithstanding the presence of the rebel forces, to enforce its own laws and arrest the par. ties engaged in their violation. The masters of the vessels, when they relied upon the rebel au thorities ns a government in fact, assumed the risk of that fact's continuing, and when, therefore, it ceased to continue, and the government thereby ceased de facto, to exist, for their protection, they had nothing to do but to take the consequences, of which they had voluntarily Incurred the risk. Hut even if the partizans of VIVANCO had con stituted a'government in fact, at the localities where the vessels were found, such fact would not have altered the case. The doctrine of the At torney General, in this regard, is merely a misun derstanding or a misapplication of a familiar and reasonable rule of international polity. When a nation is divided by intestine strife, the citizens of friendly nations, trading to its ports in the prose cution of legitimate commerce, have doubtless a right to acquiesce in the state of things which they find there, and they incur no responsibility to the rigblfal government by doing so. If they find the government, which their own authorities recognize, subverted, and a de facto government in its place, they may safely pay the duties and submit to the local regulations which the latter prescribes. If there be no blockade, they may en ter and clear, with security; dejrosi t their cargoes and take new ones, aud in line, go through all the functions of the lawful commerce which they are pursuing. In other words, they may practically recognize the existing authorities, so far as the necessities of their legitimate intercourse with the country may demand, and they are protected by the lawof nations iu so doing. And it is perfectly reasonable that this should lie so, because, s citizens of a friendly Power, they ave the right i„ carry on a lawful trade with the I revo utionized i.niioiq and it is the misfortune or the fault of the lwler js enough to maintain possession of ils own ports But the rule goes no farther-not a „ ng ,e eteD . When the friendly trader, nol content muting to the necessities of the situation, en deavors to abuse them; when be un(lertflke3 (Q beyond them, and voluntarily d eal 3 wilh thfi (fe fado government, not merely as the government of the locality, but as the government 0 f the na tion, he ceases to be within the protection of the principle, and takes the chances upon himself. Especially is this true, where he undertakes to acquire a title from or under the party in revolt, to the public domain or property. In such case, his title shares the fate of the power to which he trusts for it, and if that power cannot secure it to him he loses it. No principle is better settled, in public law, than this: that it is for Governments only, and not for individuals, to determine the po litical status of the revolted colonies or provinces of other nations; and that where the Government to which the individual belongs lias not officially recognized the altered position of tbe district or party in revolt, but continues to recognize the previously existing Government as the true one, not only the individual citizens, but even the trib. unals of justice, are bound to do likewise. The Supreme Court of the UNITED STATES has authori tatively ruled, in at least half a dozen well-known cases, that, until the Government of the Union has officially recognized a revolutionary Govern ment, 110 American citizen can have the protec tion of our Courts or our laws, 111 dealing with it, against the rights of the Government previously existing, aud still recognized here. In the case under consideration, not only bad our Government not recognized the revolutionary movement of VIVANCO— or even the existence of a Civil war in Peru—but Mr. CLAY whs, at tl.at lime, accredited to the Government of Caslilla at Lima, and was in the daily discharge of his diplo matic functions there; a treaty negotiated by him with Castilla being, about that very lime, either under negotiation or pending for ratification. It follows, therefore, as a consequence, too clear to be successfully resisted, that when the masters of the vessels in question undertook to go beyond the sphere of their lawful traffic, and to acquire a title, by spoliation, to the national property of Peru, under the grant of a pretended Govern ment which their own country did not recognize, they submitted themselves to the penalties which the laws of Peru prescribed, and they assumed the risk of arrest and its consequences. Nay, more —in voluntarily taking part with the faction in open re volt, and lending it aid and succor against the Government recognized by their own, they indu bitably incurred responsibilities still graver and more perilous, which any Government less feeble than that of Peru would surely aud justly have enforced against their persons. That our Govern ment, instead of recognizing-in good faitii and in favor of .a frieudly people, with whom we were in peace and amity—these plain principles of public law aud international comity, and instead of leaving the criminal parties to bear the losses of their illegal enterprise, as best they might, should have leaned in favor of their spoliations, and have given its sanction to their misconduct, is to be deeply lamented, as a matter involving our national respectability. To our legitimate" com merce, everywhere, the support and protection of our government are, of course, emineutly due; but it is discreditable to any high-toned nation, to be encouraging its citizens to aggravate tbe domestic feuds of its neighbors, and take advan tage of their dissensions for profit aud speculation. As we stated, when the subject was previously before us, the Government of Chili—several of whose vessels were captured at the same time and under the same circumstances with the Gcorgiana and the Lizzie Thompson— A t once volunteered to disavow all sympathy with its citizens so trespass ing, aud left their property to its fate. So too the Government of France—whose Consul was in terested in the cargo of one of the American ves sels in question—after consulting* the learned tri bunal attached to the department of Foreign Af fairs, and receiving a formal decision against the right of these vessels, under the law of nations, to undertake the traffic in dispute— not only re fused to interpose nny claim, but at once punished its Consul, by vacating his place. It has been left to our Government, not only to uphold, alone the doctrine of international spoliation, under the circumstances referred to, but to make its defence a matter of international quarrel. When we add that thi3 has been done, after repeated offers on tbe part of Peru, to submit the question to tbe arbitration of any sister government which the United States may designate, we present a picture, certainly belonging to the series of which the Ostend Manifesto was the beginning. Even if our claim wore as just a3 it is manifestly the contrarv, and even if Peru were as strong .13 she is weak the simple fact that two other sovereignties equally interested with ourselves in the identical controversy—should have deliberately abandoned, as wholly unfounded, pretensions identical with our own, ought surely to have suggested to Mr. 

BUCHANAN and Mr. BLACK, that it was possible they might he mistaken, and that an impartial arbitrator might say so. We sincerely trust that Congress will not permit the national reputation to be compromitted, by acquiescing in the per verseness of the Executive. Of all the Northern journals which have essayed fn nnraw Ihn mmnlninla nv unmisalinna il,„ South, the New York Tribune, has adopted the most offensive tone and resorted to the most tin candid arguments. For sometime prior to Mr. LINCOLN'S election it assumed a more conservative character than usual, but it ha 3, apparently, de termined, as an offset to that period of self-imposed restraint, to indulge, for a season, in the largest liberty. It no longer endeavors to conceal its real sentiments, and its readers have, therefore, been lately treated to a series of articles in which extreme views and scurrilous language were most happily combined. Whether the Tribune desires to drive the North and South further asunder than they are now, or hopes to convert the latter from the error of its ways, by villifying it continually, we will not stop to inquire, as we are neither soli citous to understand its objects nor to expose its motives. Rut as that journal exercises no incon siderable influence over the mass of the Republican party, justice to ourselves requires that we should, so far as we can, correct its misrepresentations. If we can satisfy the Northern people that we are not quite as unreasonable and reckless as that un scrupulous organ reports us to be, it is our duty to do so. The interests that we have at stake are so vast and important that it would be neither manly nor becoming to allow pride or passion to con strain us to a sullen silence. Whatever of indigna tion or contempt, therefore, we may feel towards the journal in question, we must still repel its in sinuations and reply to ils arguments. A few days ago the Tribune , in au article enti titied "The Southern Grievance," undertook to set forth what it affected to believe was the mate rial point at issue between the North and South. It informed its readers that, if they would "wade "through the columns of Southern diatribes "against the North," they would find that "the "master grievance" therein alleged against the people of the latter section was their "deficient "alacrity in catching and returning runaway "slaves." It went on to say that "the mass of "the people of the free States never did heartily "co-operate in negro catching, aud never will;" that of the fugitive slaves who cross Mason & Dixon's line "nine-tenths get safely to Canada, if "they really try, as they always did, and always "will;" and that, by the repeal of the Personal Liberty Bills, "the South would not be profited "one sliver." All this, it is further said, "South "ern politicians do not. comprehend," and Jest they should propose to "daub the cracks in the "Union with the untempered mortar of a new "compromise," they are informed, for their future guidance, that "all stipulations for greater alac "ity and efficiency in slave hunting on the part "of the free States will prove an illusion and a "sham." In reply to all this we have only to say that "Southern politicians" and the Southern people do comprehend much better than the Tribune seems to do, their own situation, and. that of the inhabitants of the free States, and also the nature of the obligations the latter are_ required to dis charge. It is not true that "the gravamen of the offence," with which the North is charged, is its "repugnance to slave catching." The South does not complain of the simple "repugnance" of the North to the rendition of fugitive slaves—she does not expect to allay that feeling—she does not in sist that all the citizens of that section shall aid in securing such fugitives—and she does not ask that any one man north of Mason k Dixon's line shall, at her dictation, abandon liis individual opinions concerning the institution of slavery. But the-South does demand, and will have jus tice—and she lias inexorably determined that, while the Union lasts, the North must honestly abide by the Constitution and the laws. She sais to the people of the free States that, whateve r may be their views about slavery or their unwil lingness to make any personal efforts to arrest fugitives, they shall, at least, abstain from insult, outrage and aggression towards those who differ with lliem. They must cease to murder and im prison Southern men, for attempting peacefully aud legally to maintain their rights—they must curb the mobs which assail, with brutal violence, the officers of the law for daring to grant the slaveholder the redress to which he is entitled— they must prevent their Courts from fraudulently using the process of the several Stalls lor the ex press purpose of defeating the remedies which an Act of Congress has provided—they must refrain from encouraging and applauding the ruffians who incite seditions and instigate murders in our midst—they must cease to scatter the most incen diary and abusive documents broadcast through out the South—they must not nullify the statutes of the land, deny the authority of the Federal Courts, and repudiate the guarantees which the Constitution framed for the protection of the Southern people. In other words, they most fairly and frankly recognize our rights, and fulfil in good faith their own obligations, if we are to re main one people. Though the South, in virtue of her peculiar institutions, has difficulties to contend with, and dangers to guard against, which the Norlli cannot or will not consider, she still asks no extraordinary favors from any quarter. She requires only what the laws and the Constitution give lier—she expects only that forbearance which the people of one race and nation usually extend to each other. Less than this will not content her, for unless these fair-demands are complied with she cannot hope to remain in the Union, grid at the same time to live in peace and salety. AN EVENTFUL WEEK. —The present week bids fair to be one big with important events. Congress as sembles to-day. To morrow, if everything goes oil well, the President's Message wi'l probably be presented, and on Thursday the choice of delegates to the South Carolina Convention takes place. MAIUN-E DISASTERS FOR NOVEMBBR.— The marine losses during llm month of November, were one steamer, six ships, four barks, one brig, and twen ty-five schooners. Of these two are missing, twen ty-three were wrecked, four burnt, five foundered, two sunk by collisions, and one capsized. Tbe to tal value of tbe craft is estimated at $560,000. 

FRONT STREET THEATRE AND CIRCUS.— This place of amusement opens this evening with Madigan & Co.'s Circus, and the world-renowned Blondin. The last named personage i 3 sufficient to draw an overflowing house. The continued success of this personage has impressed the public mind with great confidence in his powers; and it may well be so, for it does seem that anything that a man can do on a rope Blondin can accomplish. We believe that it is not too much to say that he is the greatest acrobat of the day. The performances of Monsieur Blondin this evening consists of hi 3 Wooden Shoe Dance, the wonderful Chair feat, turning a somer sault over burning candles, and a back somersault while playing a violin. lie will also make his Cat aract Ascension from the back of the stage to the farthest limit of the gallery. He will also stand on his head while blindfolded and enveloped in a sack, and also carry a man on his back. All of these per formances will be executed while on the tight rope. The equestrian corps of the Circus consists of a large number of excellent performers, many of whom are recognized stars in the profession. Uoi.r.TDAY STREET THEATRE.— Through Mr. Ford's determined will to furnish variety for our theatre goers, Ave are to have a change in the entertain ment this evening. Tbe play styled the Dead Heart, which has created such a sensation at the North, will be produced at Holliday Street, in the manager's usual liberal manner, to-night. We know nothing of the merits of the play, but judg ing from the notices given it by the press wherever it has been brought out, we feel justified in saying that our citizens are about to be presented with a stage spectacle of great interest. MUSICAL.— We would again direct attention to the advertisement in another column of the con cert to bo given to-night at the Law Buildings, by the Leethoven Society. The programme abounds in the richest classical gems, and the lover of Beet hoven will be attracted by the selections announc ed to be performed from his great Sinfonie in C. The entertainment promises to be at once varied and delightful. We must not omit to mention that the Hall has been entirely renovated, and beauti fully frescoed by the Messrs. Wissard, artists of superiority in their profession. GUN. Tost THUMB.— The veritable Tom Thumb commences his exhibition at the Temperance Tem ple to-day. The little folks will bo glad to hear of the advent of this human wonder among us. We see, that for tiieir benefit, the General will give an afternoon entertainment every day, as well as in the evening. THE ARMED INVASION OF MEXICO—LETTER FROM GEN. BICRLEY. Ihe Knights of the Golden Circle are vet alive, as will be seen by the following letter from the President of the Order to the Houston (Texas) TelegrajjJt: HUNTSVILLK, Texas, Nov. 3, 1860 EDITOR TELEGRAPH— Dear Sir:—As it is almost impossible to keep up the correspondence of the R.

LANDING OP SIX THOUSAND AFRICANS IN CUBA.— HAVANA, NOV. 25, 1860. —Never since I hare been a resident of this fair Isle have 1 before beard of the landing of so many cargoes of Bozales (Afri cans,) iu the same space of time, as have come to my knowledge within the last six or eight days.— The intelligence of the several landings reached me with such rapidity, following so close one upon the other, that I was at first chary of giving it cre dence, and consequently in the last two or three of my letters to you, have avoided all allusion to the subject, feeling that it was wiser to have my infor mation lully confirmed before giving circulation to statements capable of being contradicted. I am now, however, in possession of "proof, strong as Holy Writ," that from six to eight thou sand Bozales have been landed at various points on both sides of the Island within the last ei"-ht or ten days. It is difficult, to believe—indeed, to speak the truth, I cannot believe—that any one of these land ings of Africans has been effected without the con sent, it not with the connivance, of the Spanish au thorities of the various jurisdictions, from the Cap tain of the l'urtido (District) to the Governor or Lieutenant-Governor of the jurisdiction: and yet to prove this would, perhaps, be a matter of utter im possibility. This you will the more readily understand, when 1 tell you that, for a comparatively trifling sum of money, almost any number of witnesses required may be obtained to swear to any circumstance named to them, of which in reality they do not pos sess the most distant acquaintance.—Cor. JVeic York Times. 

FROM ANHUILIA, W. I.— A correspondent of a ISew 1 ork journal, writing from Anguilia, W. 1., under date of Nov. 2, says: The bark A. A. Dre bert, Captain Hewitt, sails to day tor Philadelphia with salt and $22,000 in specie. The island is but seldom mentioned in American newspapers. Its products, viz.: sugar, cotton and tobacco, are of a superior quality, aud England is the mart of sale. The last crop shipped to London and Liverpool consisted of 12,000 hlids. sugar, 1,720 hhds. tobac co, and 14,000 bales cotton. Large tracts of wood land are being cleared, also over 100,000 acres of beachland, banked and secured against tide water, all of which will be under successful cultivation next year. The weather is of a mixed nature, wet and warm, which is healthy and favorable for the growing crops, which promise more than an aver age yield. LATER FROM MEXICO. —The correspondent of the New York Timet at the city of Mexico says that the country will be in full possession of the Liberals in a very short time, though the Church Party, with Miramon as their tool, are improving the present, and probably only opportunity, to prepare for them along list of harassing reclamations from foreign countries, as a somen hat peremptory re minder of the dynasty which has gone before. The report of the robbery of the English Consulate is fully confirmed. Au important circular has been issued by the Minister of Justice of the Juarez Government, accompanying a communication from the Bishop of Linares, which indicates a willing ness on the part of a portion of the clergy to con form to the Laws of Reform, and those natTonalizing the Church property. 6 I* ROM Itio DE JANEIRO.— By the clipper shipGrev Eagle, at Philadelphia, we have advices from Itio de Janeiro to the 21st of October.

PerkiDS, of Worcester, Mass., for a supply of powder, revolvers, and breach-loading rifles, to be smuggled into Russia byway of the German ports, in concealed cotton baies and casks ot rice. The scheme was discov ered, and peace having been declared, the Russian broke the contract. Capt. Ferkins laid bis claim before the State De partment and a diplomatic correspondence ensued, daring which Attorney General Black sustained the claimant. His agent, Mr. Stewart, went to St. Petersburg last summer, and it is said that, with the aid of Mr. Appleton, onr Minister at St. Pe tersburg, he has obtained $385,000.-- iFaAiny(on Corretpondent, i'HE DAILY EXCHANGE, DECEMBER 3, 1860.
