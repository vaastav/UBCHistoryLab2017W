AND WILL BE EXHAUSTIVE Views of the Member From Pennsylvania Concerning C auditions in the Assessor's Cilice. Soon after the holidays the House of Representatives will start an Inquiry into the subject of taxation in the District of Columbia that may open up the whole question of District finances. Representative Morre!] of Pennsylvania will introduce the resolution upon wh'ch the Inquiry will be 1 aFed. and it Is understood that through h!s own personal efforts as a member of the House District committee he has gathered sufficient data about iaxatiun in the District. the manner in which assessments are mudt- and the manifold evils of the system, to give the invesnnmmittoo a <r(V>d StllTt. V X. ? Mr. Morrell has long been interested in District matters?lif a d interested way. if the statement bo not paradoxical?and last year gave a great deal of time anil attention to th*? question of taxation and taxation assessments. He unearthed a condition of affairs that in his op:n on Is more than sufficient?even to make imperative? a congressional investigat'en ,tf the whole subject. This it is his intention to demand as soon as Congress settles down after the holiday- recess. A careful inquiry among the mere prominent members on the republican side of the m . - . V r KkI^B Representative Morrell. Chamber indicates tiiat the House w!ll iw not at all aver- - to an invastigat on having i.. 11 r?i ..I.?t ,>n nf r>i\ii.!itinntt in r*nn flection with the taxation problem in the Distrct Then* are a number o: members of the House who. although they have not gone ?nto the subject of taxation with such thoroughness as has Mr. Morrell. hold with him tli-it steps she;ihi he taken, and * at once, to remrdy the evils complained of. These gentlemen b*l:eve that as the result of ai? inquity conducted by Congress with any degree of thoroughness, a remarkable condition of affairs w 11 be shown to exist and they want such an inquiry undertaken at the carl est possible moment. Tiie resolution will have particular force coming from Mr. Morrell, as the Philadelphia member spent practically all of his time last session in a study of the District and its system of government. Moreover, he was vitally interested in an i instrumental in having f.assed a number of measures effect'ng ike District and contiguous territory. The anti-shanghaing bill, the school bill, the compulsory education bill and a number of other measures of great importance to the I Strict were put on their passage as a result of Mr. Morrell's individual efforts. Mr. Morre]l*s Views. Mr Morrell is very much interested in the taxation problem and believes that the in quiry should be undertaken without undue delay In discussing the matter with a Star reporler last night Mr. Morrell said: "The three things most striking In regard to taxation in the I>'strict of Columbia are. lirst, the undervaluation; second, the enormous outlay or expense of assessment, and third, the system of exemption.-'. "In the course of my examination of the Kith street condemnation proceedings I stumbled upon some tm y astonishing in- j stances illustrating this point. One man owned a piece which was assessed for taxation in 11X2 at the value of $iV{. Now. W IH'II li t' 1*1 ihih-;ii l' "n i"??i auuir i mu , for a street the jury gave him as damages I10.4KE*. The jury acted under oath, and making in all probability a fair estimate of the actual value of the land taken gave the owner almost forty times as much as the land was rated at upon ti e assessors' books. "I had wondered how on earth that jury eould assess the total d images to property owners in that section at $71*5,060. while all the property along the line of the street was benefit'd only to the extent of $108,000. Hut when tills was discovered I concluded that the land most have been so peculiarly adapted to streets and so useless for any other purpose that It cou'dn't be improved In value even by the construction of a grand Iniulevard through it. "Another str king case Is that of Messrs. Klbert Robinson and Oliver A. Morris, wlio owned a lot in Denison and I^'ighton's subdivision of the Kslin estate. This lot contained 2..KM.7 square feet. and was assessed for taxes at a total valuation of SM>. The Jury awarded $2.6B0.tiT> damages, which was more than twenty-eight times the assessed valuation for taxes. M?ny Other Examples. "There were a number of similar cases. I m.ght say that they were nearly al! like it so far as the 16th street extension Is con cerned. No effort was made In selecting the examples that I have to find extreme cases. My object wis If >ly to get instances of the relative ratio of taxation to the selling price of property in each of the subdivisions invdved in the Kith street condemnation proceedings. The dnmnges awarded in these cases does not include damages for Improvements, but solely for land taken. "The situation on I'aplto! Hill is not so bad. but It is still bad enough?very much worse than It olieht to tie "There is a document published by Senator Cullom's committee entitled "the refort of proceedings in acquiring square UNO Is a site for the Senate office building.' Hhich Hirows a greit deal of light upon the lubject. From this report I gather the following examples of the difference between the value of land in the District as assessed tor taxes and the value of the same land frhen condemned for public use. "Firs! A vacant lot on B street northeast tDiitaining 2.278 square feet, was assessed V>r taxes at a square foot, and was fcisessed as a whole at The owner PKea tne government R).71-l, and the jury Jwardcd him 17.MM. "Second. Two vacant lots at the corner ?f Delaware avenue and B street northeast Here assessed at a total value of $1&629. The jury awarded "Third. A front and back lot on B street northeast were assessed at a total valuation. exclusive of Improvements, of ?1.371. The Improvements wer?* assessed at ?l,-V)0. making the assessed value of the whole property 17.071. The jury awarded $19,775. "The law requires' that assessments shall be made for at least two-thirds of the valuation, and In these cases which are only fair simples of the whole, we find property paid for by the government at from three to five times the rate at which it was listed for taxes. I am told that In the proctedingj for acquiring square as a site for an office building for the House of Representatives the amount nwarded as damages was In almost every" case four or five time? as great as varuatlon put upon the lands for taxes. Where is the Awar<:< "Right here I would tike to digress a moment. I am informed that when an effort was made to find the report and award nf thp inrv in nmrppdliurc relatlll? to this square the task proved too much. It was not among the reoords of the case, where it should have been. It had not been recorded either in the Interior Department or In the office of the register of deeds of the District. The Secretary of the Interior hud approved it and then it had been turned over to a lawyer, and with the exception of that lawyer thero was apparently no living man in possession of the legal evidence necessary to : verify fhe title of the United States to the lands included in square (SH> of this city. And this seems to have been the case Ma)', 11XH. Suppose ail these lots were sold by the former owners to innocent purchasers without notice?there being no proper legal record of the transfer of the title? who would be to blame? And what would be the result? * "But though it was imposs'ble to find the report and award of the jury In any ulace where it oueht to be filed and re corded. It was possible to find a ;>etI:'on for payment of the amount due Thomas F. Mallun under the award, the following facts, wh'.ch may be taken. In the absence of the jury's complete report *>:id award, as forming an average case: "Mallan owned subdivision No. 10. in square t!V(. This parcel of land was assessed for taxation at (0,048 and the improvements thereon at jsr.sno. making a i totni valuation of J1H..848.

The Colorado building is assessed at ifo.O.5! the land at ?l.'!li.51'2 and the building at >.t* o. "Much complaint has been made in Washington. not only against the discrimination in assessments, but also against t'.ie undervaluation of land with reference to the un;,ru\ L'liiriiis mciruii. "The flat buildings of tile District seemed to be taxed according to location, rather than actual value, these in the business section, like Stoneieigh Court, being taxed on a 50 p?r cent basis, and those in the suburbs and outlying sections on a 10 and 20 p>r cent basis. This is apparent from the assessors report of 1 '.'>05. in which it is found liiat those bu:l'~iiis locate! in different sections of the city are assessed as follows: "Northwest?109 flat buildings assessed at $405,200 for all. hniMinc $."! fkV) "Northeast?115 buildings at $351.5M) for all. "Southeast- 2 I buildings at JH&.oOO for allTotal?2^5 buildings at 0> for ail. A Ridiculous Average. "From this it would appear that the average value of a flat building in this city is. according to the assessor, only $!.21t>. Deducting the aeser.sed value of Stoneleigh Court, we have Jl'.rj.OOO as the total value of 2*4 Hat buildings in the city, making the average value of such a building only J1.705. Many of these flat buildings are immense structures, costing hundreds of (I'lMicr.nrla I *i nn>1 It nnnuoro tha( iiiuuoauua <_?i uvuaio, uitu i < ? o > uav this class of property is evidently undervalued almost as greatly as the lands around Rock Creek Park. "The business interests of Washington are apparently discriminated against. Jn addition to the cases citetl from Uie report of the jury in the Uth street extension proceedings. I migiit name numerot.s ot.iers which have come to light. f\>r instance, just take tti?* following items: "One square north of Iiolmead Manor from Hth street extended to Brightwood avenue, which was assessed at $700 an acre, or 1U, to "JV. cents a foot. Yet this land sold from XU to 35 cents a foot. "Five acres in the Jones tract on ICth street extended just beyond Brightwood ; was assessed at $:i0>) an acre, yet sold at I $3,500 an acre. j "Nine acres opposite the Cleveland cottage sold at $?>,<!<*i an acre and was assessed at $150 an acre. "March 'J:>. lUttl. four acres joining the Catholic University grounds sold for $4,500 an acre; assessed at $7110 an acre. "November, 1?M, Dumblane farm of 100 acres sold for $150,000; assessed at $150 an acre. "Piftv acres between Brookland and Metropolis View sold to a syndicate of Washington and Richmond men for $107,U0?>; assessed at $25,832." Mr. Morrell mentioned a number of other instances in support of his theory, and added: "From all these citations, it is evident that the land of the District is not taxed as under th< law it should be. and shows that were the national government to assume the entire cost of the District of Colum bla. as some people would have It do, that J no one would be benefited except the land owners. Iiot Reconcilable With Law. "It is Inconceivable how the method of assessment which now obtains in the District can be reconciled w.'th the law governing the assessment of taxes which provides that 'all real estate in the District of Pniiimhiii suhiect to taxation, including; im provements thereon, shall be assessed at not less than two-thirds of the true value thereof.' "This alw appears to be habitually violated in the District assessor's office. The facts I have stated prove, indeed, that it is entirely disregarded. "There is no proper machinery fcr correcting these existing abuses, for whenever a taxpayer appeals from an assessment on his property the appeal lies from the man who made It in one capacity to the name man in another capacity. The board of equalization should be an entirely different board from the board of assessors. "And just consider the enormous outlay. The regular force In the assessor's office consists of thirty men?one at VUXKJ, two at each, three at tl.tOO each, seven at J1.2D0 each, three at n.vm eacn, one at $1.3*iO, eight at tl.UUO, two at tl**) each and two at each. In addition to this, the appropriation bills for 190T>-'0t? carried J2 ."O) for temporary relief. The salary roll was ' $43.0ti0. The total expenditure for the asJ si ssor's office in 190"> was $04,397. "The salary account In the assessor's office of Buffalo for the same period totaled $21. The Washington office is complicated to the extreme and the expanse account entirely too large. The department of assessors cost Pittsburg $37,OJO in 1iK>l, or J27.:!!I7 less than Washington. Th-j assessment of revenue for St. L.ouis for approximately the same time costs $70,:ii."0 or only $5.1NU more than Washington, although the city is double in population ' and nearly double In wealth. Tlie Exemption Privilege. "Then there is the system of exemption. The fart that the United States pays orseiiaif of the expenses of the District seo.ns to hav.j lead the local population to the iuea that property and privileges in th? District should be taxed at one-half the rate paid by the people of other cities. The nrovision in the act of 1S7X i* nmhian. ous. It does not define taxable property, and the Commissioners have exercised a very broad discretion in the matter of de^ cluiing particular pieces of property nontaxable or exempt. "In 1WH the total assessed value of lane; exempt in the District was $177,300,0!;!. and the total assessed value of irnprove mcnts exempt was making a grand total of $2S3,CUG.848. which was at that time '>7 per cent of the entire assesses value of property in the District.

If these two companies take a stand similar to that of the Baltimore and Ohio, all yardmen in the Pitt3burg district will likely be called out on strike In accordance with the result of the vote on this question by the trainmen. The Pittsburg and Lake Krie officials are understood to have agreed to pay the "middle scale," but it is not believed the trainmen will accept this rcale unless all other roads in this district agree to a similar proposition. The "middle scale Is one cent an hour less than the scale paid in the Chicago district, and is in effect at Cleveland, Youngstown and other Ohio points.

WHITE DOMINATION London Spectator Says Race Problem is World-Wide. TROUBLES OF CONGO STATE Question of the Realignment of the I n. ruwcn. SOUTH AFRICAN PREJUDICE British Government Has Same Situation in Transvaal as Roosevelt i? Mr * tuuo ui vaaiuiuia. Special Cablegram to The Star. LONDON. Dpi-embor 8.?The question of the relations bftimn the white rare niul men of other colors is one of pretty well world-wide agitation at the present moment. It occupies the public mind in Kngland. Germany. Bclcium. France and Sd*1ii and its problems are absorbing the attention of the government* of those countries. The Congo question has now passed from the stage of sentimental discii-sston Into a serious international Issue I>espito the scathing condemnation of King Leopold In the Belgium parliament, it seems doubtful if genuine reforms will b< voluntarily adopted which will lead Great Britain to abandon her declared intention to intervene iiiebehalf of the natives in the Congo. Then we shall see the first serious test of Die A I.-,..-..1. ...xgiv-ft >CHt II CHirllir. It has happened In all previous international attempts to deal with the Congo question ihat France has supported Germany. There I* littl douht that Germany will continue to oppose any Interference t>y . the powers. The British policy of some form of Intervention has been only vaguely mentioned by Sir Edward Gre> the foreign * minister, but the French attitude on the question has not been indicated If the Clemenceau government reverses the former position and sup|>orls Great Britain, then for a ftr>t time the world will realize the far-reaching importance of that recent re-grouping of the powers which ha.?i changed the direction of modern political history. France nnd Spain are on the eve of Hit execution of their mandate to reduce the turbulent Moors to ord? r, anil there i~ every indication that their task Is m.informidable than the delegates to the Algrciras conference expected. Hough work approaching war on a small so.ile swma probable. Germany watch's with jealou* eye. but apparently she has 110 intention of making the task mote difficult by reason of threatened interference. Serious Outlook. Germany, Indeed, has a race *c indal ot her own i>f the blackest de-eiiption. No story of the Congo or of the Russian antebellum atrocities In Manchuria can compare in horror with that told in the reieh stag this week by llerr ltcbel, the socialist leader. Ho described the extermination of whole villages In South Africa by German troop.--, who massacred adults and then drowned the children In the river The most that the government could say in reply was that there had been abuses, but that the worst reports hail been exaggerated. The whole race question throughout Africa lias V.eeome one of appaliuig seriousness. Europe is determined to rule that continent, and the great problem of the treatment of the nulive races musr be speedily Settled. The Spectator today sa>5 th41 there is positive diinger lest the whole native population of Africa should become penetrated with a dread and hatred of white men. It adds: "It Is reported from many quarter* tint this feeling is already betray-in* itsiif throughout the vast dominion of the Congn Free State and it may easily spresd southward and northward till the entire continent of Afrwa is tilled with a hostility to L",A.r? raa.mKllnlv f Knf .,.1,1,1, QAll ago undermined the ascendency of the triumphant Spanish monarchy There is a community of the bUck as there is of the white world, and while the black Is prepared to be governed l>y his white superior with a certain absolutism he will not beir that unreasonable cruelty which keeps him In perpetual terror as well a.- a kind of bewilderment as to what is required of him, wrhich tempts inferior races to believe thai only in missaere can they find deliverance. There Must Be Justice. "The white men in Africa can never be i t? resistible from the^r numbers and the popu lar European belief that the blacks cag never combine and can. therefore, neve, revolt successfully is but partially ?ui? ported toy evidence. A lijntu tribe annihilated a British regimen i and tiiere liavt been black generals developed from th? people who founded kingdoms and made effective armies. Europe desired to rule Africa and intends to do it, but she lias sufficient perception of her own Interest not to svisn 10 uo it i>> incessant ngnunfc or :hrougli a system like that which is graduilly extirpating the black races in t'ne vast system of valleys which we call the Congo State. However stern the conquerors are n enforcing their own superior civilization, hey must oe seen to w:sh lor substantial Ufjtice, however harsh, and must avoid a ruelty which suggests to their victims that :hey are in the hinds rather of evil demo.is han of able lighting men. "We must add, though we are unwilling to *nter upon that side of the subject, that jeaceful security will never be attained un.11 tile invaders iiave learned what we earlx earned in India?to let the women atone. "Negresses of South and Central Africa ire not Knglish ladies, but they care for heir children, mid if some of the stories in he German parliament are true there may :e hatred and dread of white men handed lown through the villages from generation o generation.

The Britisli government finds Itself facefl with a similar difficulty in the Transvaal as onfronts President Roosevelt in Caiiforlia's anti-Japanese action. The inhabitants >f the Transvaal resent the competition of latives of India who have immigrated to hat country. They have endeavored to discriminate against them by imposing serious Usabilities In what is known as the 'Asiatc law amendment ordinance."
