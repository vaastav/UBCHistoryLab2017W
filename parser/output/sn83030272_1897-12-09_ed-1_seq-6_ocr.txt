It In tho concluding sentenco of bts mes- W sage,, tho President advised Congress to : :M' dccreaao Appropriations rather than In- crcoao them. SVT " Whllo tho Congress may not And It an W easy task," ho said, "to reduce tho ex 9? praises ot tho Government, it should noton- eourafco their Incrcaso. These expenses $ trill, in my Judgment, admit of a decrcano fc 'n many branches of tho G overnment, with If out Injury to the publlo enrIco. It Is a j? commanding duty to keep the appropria I tlons within tho receipts of tho Govern fe ment, and thus avoid a deficit." &' This" Is admirable advice. Nobody can if' quostlon its soundness. $f. Yet wo find that the total of approprla- tlons recommended by tho several depart ?r ments for tho fiscal year ending Juno 30, ffi 1800, tho fiscal year for which the present V? session Is to provide, amounts to $004,522, feS, 803, exceeding the total expenditures ot tho i past fiscal year by moro than $30,000,000. '; Moro than that, the department cati 55. motes Wor 1800 exceed even Secretary v Gage's very hopeful estimate of revenue H for that fiscal year by $22,000,000. sk We lnfor, therefore, that President Mo ll Kini.ey desires the Congress to doal un fig sparingly with tho estimates of his Cabinet M officers, If a decrease, ot expenditures Is to i be achieved nnd a deficit avoided. J Moreover, tho friends of Mr. MoKinusy'b plan for breaking the endless chain will bo ta peculiarly Interested In tho realization ot tho rigid standard ot economy which tho !np President has set up for Congress, but jj? which the departments havo overlooked. j The attempt to break tho endless chain g by refusing to pay out greenbacks once re- ; deemed except In exchange for gold Is not W to begin until " tho receipts of tho Govern- lMS mentaro quite sufficient to pay all the ex- iw rienscs of the Government." j5' That Is to say, the Administration's pol- W ley Is to postpone any revision of tho cur- J rency until tliero Is a surplus instead of a ? doflclt ; a change of conditions which can K& bo effected only by either cutting down Pfe expenses or raising more revenue j. This is as it should be ; but the process jX ot cutting down expenses might appro- ' prlately and gracefully havo begun In tho '" department estimates. 'M President McKlnley and Cuban Bol- f lljrerency. A large part of tho President's message 3? was devoted to the Cuban question. Ot .,'" tho references to this subject, the most lm- ;$,, portant arc those which deal with tho ox- 'is' pedieucy of recognizing tho Cuban revolu- M, tionlsts as belligerents. Tho conclusions W arrived at by Mr. McKinlet nre, first, that, ft. In tho ejo of International law, the Cubans M do not yet deserve to be recognized as bcl- S- llgerents, and, secondly, that such a recog- f nltion would do them moro harm than ,': good. Let us examine these assertions Jjfc separately. Wo may take for granted that , the views of tho law applicable to the mat- glr ter havo been submitted to -tho President ' v tho State Department and by the At- . tornoy-General, and wo do not, for a mo- il'WL ment, doubt that ho would modify his con- ,j 4p elusions, if cause could be shown for deem 'JEJ . ' lng those views to bo Ill-founded. W Mont of tho grounds for the assertion that Mt tho Cuban revolutionists havo not yetqual- 'm lflcd themselves to be recognized as bellig- JK ercnts nre set forth in the mewuicra nf l'rpK. ffik Idcnt GnANT, dated Dec. 7, 1875, certain S, rclovant passages from which are quoted JSk by Mr. McKlNLKY. Among these passages M Is tho following: "Unless justified by M necessity, It tho recognition of belliger- ja oncy is always, and justly, regarded as "M- an unfricn(l'y acti Qnd a gratuitous demon- ;M stration of moral support to the rebellion.' tjK Gen. Giia.nt went on to remark : K "Ttie conflict muat be one that will be reeognlied, m Intheaenaeof International law.asnar. The mtro ra extitenco of eontendlnir armed bodlentand their occa I atonal conflict, do not constitute war In the Heme re ferred to. Applying to theexUttnfr condition of af fairs In Cuba the teiU tecognlird by publlclsO and writers on International law, I fall to And In the In surrection the existence of such a substantial politi cal organization, real, palpable, and manifest to the world, having the forms, and capable of the ordinary functions of Uorcrnment toward Its own people and to other States, with ourts for the administration ot Justice, with a local habitation, possessing sucli or ganization of force, such material, such territory as totnkethec Dtestout of the category of a mere re bellious lnsurrcs tlon and place It on the terrible foot ing ot war, to which a recognition of belligerency wouU aim to elevate It." Let us look somewhat closely at these passages, each of which Is based on viows propounded by Mr. H. II. Dana In his Notes to Wiiraton; views, honover, for which cry little support can bo found in any other authority on international law. Through Dana'h views runs a fundamental and fatal confusion of thought between W tho status required on tho part of an in. surgeut people for tho recognition of . bellitierrncu nnd tho statiin which n-nnlil I justify third parties In recognizing their inffcj)fii(frirr. Lot ub, for tliu sake of greater clearness, taku up tho passages seriatim. President GnANT, followlngDANA, said that, "unless justified by necessity" tho recognition of robclsas belligerents "isahvuvs, and justly, regarded as an unfriendly act, and a gratu itous demonstration of moral support to tho rebellion." It Is a mistake to assume that tho recognition of belligerency by third parties must bo justified by necessity. It Bufllcesthat It bo Justified by humanity. Indeed, humanity Is tho usual ground on which such a recognition Is based, and this k ts to tho honor ot modern civilization. 1 Tho chief aim of the lowest grado ot recognition, that of mere belligerency, Is ; to mitigate tho horrors of civil war by sub- if stltutlng the more humane regulations of tho law of nations for tho rigorous enforce- OL mentof penal laws. It Isobvlous that, so long 'IS' as tho officers and soldiers of a rebel army m 0T t'ie n'rers on(' waincn of a rebel ship, W- havo causa to fear that, It captured, they will bo Imprisoned as State criminals or vg punished by death, they will bo impelled dSL to rovengo themselves upon tho prisoners '' which they, In turn, may moke from among P tho troops of tho Government. If, on tho '$,. contrary, Insurgents are assured that the ;' euenilcs against whom they are carrylngou fa TiTI. Ti r77- I , ii . i iMnMtumfilin nriifti..iw,i warfare will not punish them as criminals, but will treat them as enemies according to tho rules ot International law, they, to6, when victorious, will conform to tho law of nations, and will abstain from nil useless barbarities. It is qui to true that tho recognition even ot belligerency Is apt to bo regarded by the parent Stato as an unfriendly act and as n demonstration of moral support to tho rebellion. It docs not follow that such a view Is just. Spain so regarded that recognition of belligerency which wo accorded to tho Spanish-American revolu tionists, " from tho commoncement of their revolution," as Mr. FonsYTll pointed out In a letter to Mr. GonosrizA on Sept. 20, 1810. We, ourselves, rcsentod tho recog nition of the Confederates as belligerents by Spain, ''but that was because wo thought her too hasty, tho stop hav ing lccn taken before tho first battlo ot Dull Dun. Presently, as Judge HAni.AN has pointed out In FonD vs. Sunoirr, we, ourselves, acknowledged that tho dictates of humanity required oven our own Government to recognlzo tho Con federates as belligerents. Touching tho sarao point, Mannino says, In tho Law ot Nations : " The concession of belligerent rights may, at a cer tain epoch of the strife, be claimed both In the Inter ests ot humanity and of neutral States. Thsro always. Indeed, arrives m moment at which snoh a concession is made (as In the oase of the late Southern Insurrection la the United States) by the very Govern ment against whloh the revolt takes plaoe." Mannino goes on to say that the main difficulty encountered by third parties lies In ascertaining the moment proper for what is called the recognition of belligerency: "It must neither be so premature as to embarrass friendly Oovernment In suppressing whatynay prove to be only a transient or partial display of dis order or treachery, nor. on the other band, so dila tory as to protract the Inconvenient) and cruelty In cident to a contest conducted on a large scale, apart from all the humane alleviations whloh the laws ot civilised war have Introduced." As to what constitutes preraatureness, and what dilatorlncss, our Government, of courso, should consider tho circumstances of eaoh particular case, but always in tho light of Its own precedents. During tho strugglo of tho Spanish-American main land colonists for their Independence, as wo have seen, and again upon tho revolt of tho Toxans from Mexican rule, the United States granted, at a very early period in the contest, tho rights of belligerency to tho Insurgents. Of course, it is a condition precedent to tho recognition ot rebels as belligerents, that tho conflict shall bo one which will be. regarded as war in tho sense of international law. Bluntsciili says : Every struggle with the armed hand, even when it may be organised in a military manner. Is not a war. When, In southern Italy, brigands form them selves Into armed troops, regularly commanded, and give battle to the Oovernment troops, they do not, for that reason, constitute a belligerent party, but only bands of malefactors. The distinction rests upon this, that war Is a political struggle, engaged In for political ends. Brigands neither aspire to defend the existing political system nor to create a new one) they obey only the guilty desire of obtaining by vio lence control of the persons and possessions of their neighbors. They properly fall, therefore, within the Jurisdiction of criminal tribunals, and the law of nations ts not concerned with them." Bluntsciili proceeds to observo: "It Is a different matter when. In a State, a large party of citizens or subjects, convinced of the neces sity of a revolution, or of the Justice of their claims, take up arms, organize themselves In a military man ner, and oppose regular troops to the troops of the Oov ernment. It cannot be maintained that such an or ganized body of citizens, animated by a political pur pose, does not possess a possible aptitude for the cre ation of a new state." It is precisely on this question of possible aptitudo that tho propriety of recognizing rebels as mere belligerents rests, and not at all upon their possession of tho much ampler qualifications prescribed for a rec ognition ot independence. This will bo clear If we bear In mind how tho terms aro defined by tho authorities. LoniMER (Law of Nations) defines belligerency as follows : "Belligerents have an lnternaUonol existence for one purpose only, viz., for the purpose of fighting, and thus ascertaining, by the verdict ot battle, their further right to full final recognition." Elsewhere the same authority says, with regard to tho lowest grado of recognition, that, namely, of belligerency : "There Is the recognition of the Inchoate State as a Jural claimant for separate recognition, that Is to say, thn acknnwtetlcrment of Its rlaht tn cnntAnri fnrfta recognition, or, to borrow a phrase from municipal law, of Mts title to sue. The form whlob recognition usually assumes at this stags Is thst of a concession of belligerent rights." The claim to bo recognized as belligerents by no means depends, as President GnANT Imagined, upon the ability of rebels to exhibit their possession of all tho proofs and Incidents of Statehood which would bo required for the recognition ot their independence. Concerning this point, Bluntsciili savs: " The quality of belligerents Is accorded to armed parties, who, without having rrcelred from an al ready existing State the right to combat with armed forcea, have militarily organtzod themselves, snd struggle In good faith, within their own State, for a political right." Touching tho same point. Halt. (Interna tional Law), remarks: "As soon as a considerable population Is arrayed In arms, with the professed object of obtaining political ends, It resembles a State too nearly for It to be possi ble to treat Individuals belonging to such populations as criminals. It would be Inhuman for the enemy to execute Its prisoners; It would be still more Inbumsn for foreign nations to capturo and hang the crews of warships as pirates. Humanity requires that such a community be treated as belligerents." So much for the confusion of thought be trayed in one of tho passages from Presi dent Gbant'b message of Dec. 7, 1875, which Is quoted by Mr. McKinley: a con fusion between a recognition of belliger ency and u recognition of Independence, and the respective requirements therefor, as defined by the law ot nations. Nowlet us glanco at the second assertion, that our recognition of tho Cubans as belllgcrcnta would do them more harm than good. It might ho sufficient to reply that tho Cubans are tho best judges of that, unless wo are to carry our nssumptlon of a pater nal attltudo to lengths oddly Inconsistent with our simultaneous refusal to maintain neutrality between tho Cubans and their oppressors. It is certain that a recognition of belligerency and Its Invarlablo conse quent, a proclamation ot neutrality, wero things passionately desired by the Spanish American insurgents in tho first quarter of this century and again by tho Tcxaus in tho thirties. Hera wu may observe that Loin ill it (Law ot Nations), after pointing out that, "by recognizing belligerent rights, neutral powers pronounco no judgment whatever either ou tho merits of tho claim or tho probability ot Its ultlmato vindication," goes on to say; "Bel ligerent recognition is a more declaration of Impartiality. To withhold from tho claimant for recognition tho rights ot bel ligerency, while wo extend thorn to the parent State, vtould be, plainly, to tako part In tho war" ou the stile of the parent Slate. To a similar effect writes Pomeiioy, (International Law) : "To refuse such recognition (that of belligerency) might, undrr certain circumstances, have the direct effect of causing the State so refusing to take the j MMtssKs "; p"gfT -e-Mstafti!w(MVI - IT 1 f ill IT liMSiiaisTsMITnilTirT " " ' trtof the mother eotmtrr against tie rebel." Asa consequence, If another power would remain strlotl neutral to the contest that very attltntH rnasf Involve the recognition of rh Insurgents as belligerents. Unless another power desires to take active part In the hostilities and throw tho wlgM of Its Influence, nnd. under some circumstances, the positive aid of Its executive powers. In favor of the mother country, It must treat the rebels as belligerents." A single cxamplo will suffice to show that, at present, wo do not even protend to bo nou tral between Spain nnd Cuba, and that tho Cubans may suffer grlovously from out withholding neutral rights. Under our neutrality act, It Is a misdemeanor to lit out or provldo tho means for a ves sel with tho object of cruising or committing hostilities against any for eign prlnco or State. The Cubans, there fore, and their Amorlcan friends, are do barred from fitting out vessels In American porta to further tho Cuban cause. As mat ters now stand, howovcr, and In tho absenco of a recognition of Cuban belligerency, Spain has a perfect right to equip cruisers In this country for uso In Cuban waters against her revolted colonists. Of this ntato of things sho took advantago In tho last Cuban revolution, by fitting out hero some thirty gunboats. Could there bo a clearer demonstration of tho fact that there can bo no such thing as" neutrality between a parent Stato and insurrectionists, until the belligerency of tho latter has been rec ognized I Do we, or do wo not, mean to stand neutral and Impartial between the Cubans and the Spantardsf For Mayor of Boston. Boston Insists upon having a municipal campaign at a time, of year when It ought to bo picking out Christmas presents. In No vemler It was a Republican city. Is It a Republican city In December? Tho Boston Republicans Bcom to havo prevented a di rect answer to this question, for In nomi nating tho Hon. Edwin Ufton Curtis for Mayor thoy distinctly absolved htm In ad vance from any "partisan" obligation, thus diminishing tho value ot tholr victory, if they should be victorious. Some Republicans ore supporting tho present Mayor, tho Hon, Josiah Quincy. Tho supporters of Mr. CunTis, who has been Mayor, and a good Mayor, for ono term, seem to rely a good deal upon tho fact, explained with much plausibility by Mayor Quincy, that tho net city debt has been increased by about five million dol lars during tho present year. Mr. Quincy, who Is known as a deep and silent thinker and an Industrious distributer of office, is said by his opponents to be lame as a man of business. Thoy assert, for Instance, that at tho beginning of tho fiscal year ho had an appropriation of $30,000 for "office, ex penses." Of that sum $38,002.02 has been spent. There remains $7.08 for the ex penses of December and January. Is that business? ask tho Jeerors. Tho real troublo with Mr. Quincy is that sinco the Chicago Convention he has never dared to Bay whether his soul Is gold or sil ver. So the gold Democrats, not innumcr ous in tho Back Bay, yearn to smite him, and tho raving Bryanltcs, on tho other hand, have sworn to have his blood, if ho has any. It Is well to rcmomber, however, that tho Boston Democratic machine is re sponsive to tho hands of Mr. Quuccy and Ib not consumed with admiration ot the Bon. Georoe Fiied Williams, Tho most interesting figure In tho cam paign Is tho Hon. Thomas Riley, straight and hot Bryanlte candidate for Mayor on a platform which Includes a plan of cam paign against department stores. Mr. Riley has an ornate curly head and ornate curly sentiments. In his letter of accept ance he sniffs at Mr. Qcincy's genealogical tree and cuddles "the poor." "I love the law, because within Its hard lines I have found the sunlight. In Its pursuit I have been able to old the weak and curb the strong. Often the welcome task has been mine to defend the poor and lowly of every faith and clime. I know their short and simple annals. In their story I read any own. Others might get certifications of good character from ancient tombs, but I could not, for my ancestors sleep far away." In Mr. Riley's opinion Mr. Quincy Is " a false knight, and unworthy of the spurs ho wears." Mr. Quincy may havo accepted the commission offered him as Major in tho Boston Light Infantry, but who ovor saw him with spurs? Onco more Mr. Riley sniffs at tho genealogical tree: "I was not brought up with a silver spoon In my mouth. My Infant Umbe wero not wrapped In purple and One linen." If ho had chorgod Mr. Quincy with being brought up with a gold spoon, tho accusation would havo been more serious. Another chargo brought against Mr. Quincy by Mr. Riley Is that he "has sought to change tho law of taxation so that all its burden might bo placed on real estate. Tills would exempt tho bonds of tho rich and crush tbo cabins of tho poor." Finally Mr. Riley calls upon Mr. Quincy and his "fellow traitors" to " get certifi cates of regularity nnd Democracy from W. J. Biiyan nnd G. F. Williams," if they can. Mr. Williams sympathizes with Mr. Riley, but Mr. Bhyan cruelly declares that ho doesn't know Mr. Riley. It has been observed that Mr. Bryan Is a little slow in getting information about munici pal elections. At a meeting last Monday ovcnlngto rat ify himself, Mr. Thomas Riley darted theso curly lightnings: " As I entered this hall to-night I heard the cry on the streets ot the President's message, nnd It flashed upon me sadly hut boldly that had It not been for treachery the most vile, for treason the most dark, at the end of that message you and I to night would read not the namo of William McKiilby, but tho name of William Jevsikos DnTAit. I stood where the battle raged the fiercest. I ssw what was going on. I passed through tho Htato of Ohio and there learned a lesson. " Passing from Democratic treachery, 1 witnessed Republican corruption, and I wish to emphasize here what my Ufo has bocn, that now, as over, I am tho enemy of tho Republican party In the city, In the State, In the nation, and In the world, as It Is exam pllfl ed. "I proposo In this campaign to devote my energy and whatever Intellect the nood (lod has given me to strike It down, uo matter what the result may he." Tho Boston Republicans hope that Mr. Riley will draw enough Democratic votes from Mr. Quincy to elect Mr. Curtis. Mr. Ill ley's method of striking down the Re publican party strikes It very favorably. China's Million Taols. Aroused to her danger from German ag gressiveness, and alarmed, perhaps, at find ing sho has not a friend to liolp her, China Is willing, It appears, to pay a million taels as indemnity for tho murder of the mis sionaries. This amount is excessive, but it includes a big slice for tho German Gov ernment. The execution ot tho murderers, the degradation of tho local Governor, and the rebuilding of destroyed missionary property, will of course ho added, whllo China will even grant railroad and mining privileges to Germany in Shantung prov- Ilnce. She will do much to get the German armed forces awny from her soil. But will her million tools and her other offers bring about this result! Tho (rank cynicism of the Reichstag discussion tho other day makes It doubtful. Ono might almost Imagine tho prevailing sentiment In tho dobate to bo that ot congratulation on tho opportunity which tho murders had given to Germany. Tho Government Is using It to Its full worth forgetting grants for naval Increase. Minister Von BOlow said that Germany was no longer satisfied to bco other powers divido tho world among them, whllo Bho contented herself "with a placo In heaven." In vlow of Germany's grabs in Africn and her formal division ot tho Pacifia Islands with England n few years ago, tho words of tho Foreign Minis ter aro fanciful, but at best they show tho current feel lng and bode HI for China. Tho sending out of reinforcements to Klao Chou Bay suggests a deliberate effort to found a German colony In Asia. It Is said that the four companies of marines number ovor 1,200 officers and men, and tho company of naval artillery about 200, and that they will bring tho total at Klao Chou to over 4,500, which Is a larger forco than Germany has ever sent outside of European waters. Tho Emperor, too, has mado a spe cial morlt of tho fact that his "only brother" Is to go In command, and will perhaps try to havo tho result shed glory on his family. Altogether, therefore, China's prospects aro not rosy. Tho Iato movement of tho Germans from tho forts to tho town of Klao Ohou, which thoy entered, is signifi cant, and tho killing of Germans in battlo would glvo the Kaiser all tho chance he desires for a long and perhaps permanent occupation. As tho case stands, China has now offered, If tho despatches aro correct, moro than adequate indemnity for tho lato crime. But her million may not buy re lief if Germany, no longer content, as Von BOlow says, with a placo in heaven, is de termined to havo a share of tho Celestial Empire on earth. Street Nomenclature. A resolution was offered In tho Board ot Aldermen on Tuesday to change officially tho names of several streets, as follows: Elm street to Lafayctto place, Clinton placo to Eighth street, Barratto street to 150th street, and Hughca avenue to Jef ferson avenue. To-day at tho City Hall there Is to bo a publlo hearing on the propriety of making theso changes, and for the discussion ot other proposed changes of tho names of various new streets in the annexed district. Tho hearing is called none too soon, for othcrwlso there is pretty certain to result such confusion and complexity In Btrcet names in Now York as to Interfere seriously with tho business of residents, to say noth ing of tho convenience, enjoyment, and safety of visitors. Tho plan adopted by tho Aldermen for street names In tho city of New York Is of a primitive and somewhat unsatisfactory character. Originally it was agreed, if not officially provided, that on Manhattan Isl and, in Wnrds Ono to Twenty-two inclusive, no two streets or avenues Bhould bear tho same designation; but there was a depart ure from this rulo in favor of somo few names particularly desired. Tho word " place" came to bo substituted as a sort of alternative designation. Thus, whllo thcro Is a Columbia street In New York, a namo of patriotic significance, there is also a Co lumbia place. Tho name ot Clinton ts in delibly impressed upon the early history of this city; It is borne jointly by a street and a place, so called, though actually by two streets. New York has never beon grudging in its recognition of Washing ton's fame ; there is a Washington street and a Washington place. There Is a Park avenue and a Park place. We have llkowise Manhattan street and Manhattan avenue; Franklin street and Franklin place; Green wich street nnd Grccnwloh avenue ; Bek man street and Beekman place, and so on throughout our beloved town to the confu sion of many persons. This confusion has been aggravated by tho policy pursued by the Aldermen, tho predecessors of the present board. In tho naming ot streets in the annexed district, the Twenty-third nnd Twenty-fourth wnrds, which havo been a part of New York since 1874. In theso wards, streets, avenues, and places havo been designated officially, without reference to tho names on Manhat tan Island. The result Is that the names given in tho territory beyond tho Harlem arc, many of them, duplicates of tho names south of that estuary. The same name is used in many instances. Sinco 1800 there has been another "an nexed district," and as the streets are laid out and tho avenues are officially desig nated and places are equipped with titles, there Is, in fact, a triplication of names. Tho inconvenienco and uncertainty aris ing irom tins memnu win oo a yet; moro serious causo of complaint after Jan. 1, when officially tho enlargement of New York goes into effect. Certain street names will appenr in tho Greater New York not less than four times. What is needed is a new, comprehensive, and progressive method of so designating tho streets ot New York that tho confusion may bo obviated as far as possible. Tho Squadron for Florida Bay. The selection of Florida Bay as tho scene of the winter manoeuvres of tho North At lantic squadron seems to be wise. These waters Ho at tho southern end of tho penin sula, between the reefs and tho mainland, and In courtesy, doubtless, to Spain, as well as with a vlow to dispel anxieties nnd disarm criticisms, the orders to Admiral SiCAlin direct him not to go boyond a lino running from Dry Tortugas to Key West. I.ast winter tho annual practlco of tho squadron in tho Gulf of Mexico was wholly Intermitted, out of consideration for Spain, nnd, In fact, if memory serves us, thcro has been no cruise ot tho squadron as a whole In Caribbean waters since Admiral Meade commanded it. His successor, Admiral Bunck, conducted his prolonged and uso fill drills In Northern waters, and tho exer cises of Admiral Sicaru havo thus far been carried on not further south than tho Caro llnos. But winter training Is ot value, and the Gulf is the latitude for it. A contemplated winter cruise of year be fore last was put off, wo believe, becansa tho Venezuela dlsputo had not yet been settled, nnd then Spain's troubles camo to tho foreground. But somo naval officers, tecognlzlng tho valuo of winter drills, bellevo that wo havo now shown suf ficient consideration In foregoing them, and tho present opportunity Is favor able for tholr resumption. The Madrid Government seems just now better satis fled with the good faith ot our own than It has sometimes been, while in the event of a Budden and great cliango In tho Cuban situation, arising cither out of the events of tho war or the action of Congress, the squadron would be In a commanding posi tion, only a few hours' run from Havana, -tlLt.u ' n 'Vfr I I, ' inn r -.3fc j, . Hat the real purpose ts the rcsumptloa of the wlntor drills. With tho battleships Iowa, Indiana, Massachusetts, Malno, and Tcxm, the ar mored cruisers Brooklyn and New York, and tho monitor Terror, Admlrat Sicaro will havo a flno squadron of armorclads under his command for cxcrclsis. Thcro will nlso bo unarmorcd vessels near hy, tho cruisers Montgomery and De troit and tho gunboat Vesuvius be ing on patrol work, whllo tho Marble head goes to Port au Prlnco and the Newport to Nicaragua. AH these belong to tho North Atlantic squadron, as do tho Nashville, now at Norfolk, and the despatch boat Fern. Of course, most or all of them will he on other duties, but the torpedo boat flotilla may bo ablo to join in tho exercises at Key West. An Obscure Point In Secretary Gage's Gitrroncy Scheme. Secretary Gage's plan of currency reform, presented by him in his report to Congress, requires clearing up in one Important point. Among other amendments to tbo National Bank act ho recommends this : " Fourth After said hanks have deposited such bonds, greenbacks. Treasury notes, or silver certifi cates lo tht amount of CO per cent, of thtir capital they shall be permitted to Issue bsnk notes In ad dition to the DO per oent. thus provided, to the extent o SB per cent, osueh deposit, which said 35 per cent, may be unsecured by any direct pledge ot security, but Issued against tho assets ot the bank." This apparently restricts the Issue of secured notes by each bank to CO por cent, ot Its capital, and that of unsecured notes to 2D percent, of tho SO per cent, deposit, or 12ia per cent, of Its capital, making 02 percent, altogether. Yet, a llttlo further on, the Secretary says : "I am confident that under an act allowing a greater liberality of Issue and less burdensome rates or taxation those banks would And It to their Interest to Issue, Instead of (18.1)1)0,000, the amount whloh they have at present outstanding, a sum racial to (fts full amount of their capital, and. In addition. In the Season of cron actlvltv. an aAAlttnnal ummiimiI volume erircuIaKon approximating US percent, of thtir capital." Hero, a volume of circulation aggregating 125 per cent, of the capitals ot tho banks Issuing It Is plainly Indicated, and, there fore, no restriction to 022 per cent, can be contemplated. Tho contradiction may bo only apparent, but It needs explanation. Prosress of the Six Days' Race. Less than three days remain for the am bitious long-dlstanco wheelmen at Madison Square Garden to mako tholr Individual records in the six days' race. Tho mon who havo held out thus far aro greatly fatigued, but are, nevertheless, courageous and per sistent. It has been proved in tho last thirty-six hours that although a rider may lead In tho first half of a 142-hour race, that clrcumstanco Ib by no means a guar antee of his winning. Tho present contest has also demon strated that in continuous bicycle riding tho mobt Important thing for a ridor to observe is method. Unless he knows by experience Just how long he enn ride with out seriously overtaxing his strength, tho chances aro nine to one that he will at tbo outset yield too freely to his ambition, and thereby disqualify his muscles for tho harder work that comes later on. At tho beginning of tho raco thcro wero somo who thought that Hale's record of 1,010 miles, mado lost year, would not bo beaten. But as tho contest progresses that Idea Is being dispelled ; and unless tho un expected happens, tho man who Is to win this timo will havo to cover more than 2,000 miles. Some of our foreign cousins have mado a splendid exhibition of skill and have main tained high places In tho list. Whether their strength, grit and endurance aro superior to thoso of wheelmen on this sldo of tho ocean will bo shown conclusively on Saturday night. Rice, Milleu nnd other American riders have a great many admirers, and ono ot them may tako first placo in tho final heat. While tho raco is moro than half over, It Is still difficult to name tho winner. If, however, Ireland is obliged to relinquish rllft wnrlri'n rlinmnlntiQliln tn tl.A TT.ilt.w1 States, it will not cause general surprise.

ART 2tOXSh rat-traits by Mr. Candar sit Bnrand.nael Th Phlladelahl Acasletar. An exhibition of six portraits by Mr. Antonio de la Gandara, a young French cslntcr of Span lsh parentage. Is in progress at tho galleries ot Durand-Ruel, 1181) Fifth avenue. Mr. Oandara is a pupil of OcTAino, and has been a regular nnd notable exhibitor at tho Champ de Mirs Salon since Its foundation, In 1800. Tho rnlnloguoof tho present exhibition Ii prefacod with rv oulo pUtlo biographical sketch In which wo nro told that "In fact, as ono of our fircat Amcrlcnn dil ettanti says 'Mr. do la Qandnra mut be considered tho painter par txctllcucc of tho grand monde,'" a pretonslon backed by tho list of hit portraits, which Includes thoso of tho Comtesso do GrelTiilho. tho l'rln cosse do Cararaan-Chttnay, tho I'rincs Ilor gheso, tho Prlnco de Sngan, and others. Then follow extracts from tho columns of Paris journals In which Mr. Qnndara's work Is re ferred to with amlnblo nhrases. The rnrd of Invitation speaks ot this exhibition as being "ot somo of his moetnotablo portraits, nalnted In Europe." Mr. Gandara has not boon hero yot, hut ho Is coming. Hut vhy "painted In Europot" Now York is not a bad placo to paint portraits. M. do Mad razo, Sargent. Munkacsy, llonjamtn Constant, Chnrtran, and IlerLomor havo come over and patntod many. Mr. lloldlnl has just nr rived and Mr. Gabriel Ferrier Is coming. Tho catalogue gives the titles of tho portraits as "Mmo. Gulllourae 11.," "Mine. S.," "Mmo. G.," "Mmo. Sarah II.," &c. This Is qulto In good tasto as regards "Mmo. 8." or "Miss It." (another portrait), bur. It It excessively mys terious In tho caso ot "Mmo. G.," who Is tho well known Paris nrofessional beauty. Mme. Gauthcreau, vhoso portrait by 8argent Is a mnstorplece, and whose picture by Courtols has been exhibited In Chicago. " Mme. Sarah 11." Is Ilornhnrdtt It is a good likeness. Tho six canvasos aro all portrnlts of women, all Ufo slzo and patntod In full length. "Mme. Gulllaumo II." is tall and stout and wears a I rose-colored gown. It Is tho least attractive of tho pictures. "Miss It.," In palo yollow, is lnde clslvo and weak. "Mmo. K" with a roso-col-ored opora cloak. Is ongaglng. well posed and substantial. Tho rose color is qualified with gray and Is dolightful In tone, and is also broadly and competently laid on. " Mme. S." is a charming llttlo lady In street costume in which grays predominate, with a hat crowned with w hi to feathers. Thoro Is solidity in the work and tho general tono of tho canvas Is agreea ble, even distinguished. Tho hands, small and simply indlcatod, are vory good. Mme. Gau thorcau is shown with her back to tho spectator and head turned so as to show her beautiful profile. -Tho hair is dressed In tbo extreme of a fashion and looks exaggerated. The gown Is whlto. and tho neck and shoulders show well, for it Ib cut very low. There Is a nlco compre hension ot values In tho light on tho shoulders and tho sheen ot tho corBogo, and tho white of the robo is of a subtlo tint throughout. The portrait of Mme. Dornbardt shows tho great ar tist In back view, with tho head in pro file. The gown Is white, with big sleoves. Tbo general cfToct Is stately and tho color Bchcmo, a simple ono, is well defined. All of theso portraits, with tho exception of that of Miss It., which has almost nothing to recom mend it, possess somo good qualities, but the host of them isadollcato sonso of color. They aro all decorative rather than naturalistic Though tho work of a joung man of thlrty-Uve, they seem to bo decadont in spirit. Tho suc cessful ones possess charm but not virility. Tho artist has had so much success abroad that it would hardly bo appropriate to say that tho pictures aro promising, for a painter who achioves success byshoit roads is not inclined to toil on tho long ones. We havo twenty men lnour studios who could. If they chose, give Mr. Gandara cards and spades and beat him at his own gamo. The nlnotleth annual report of the Pennsyl vania Acaaomy of tho flno Arts shows that it is a well conducted institution. It has held to Ub course through long yearaof vicissitudes and ctvio changos. and ita President and directors may well congratulate tho stockholders and all thoso who care for art and Its development on Its present prosperity. Sinco tho last annual re port was printod tho Henry C. Gibson collection of works of art In painting and aculpture has been transferred to tho academy and Installed In galleries C anJ. D.

Couture, Diaz, Cazln, Fantln-Latour, and Alfred Slovens. At the sixty-sixth annual exhibition last year gold medals and other prizes were awarded to George De Forest Brush, J. W. Alexnndor, Albert Iferter, and other American artists. Tho schools aro well at tended, and tho classes receive criticisms from a corps of Instructors with William M. Chaso and Miss Cecilia Beaux at their head. The general statement of tho Treasurer shows that the academy's uork was carried on during tho last fiscal year with an excess of $ 1.003 of rocolpts o er expenses. The managing director is Harri son S. Morris. This year's exhibition will ODon In a few weeks from now, and will consist In large part of pictures from New York painters.
