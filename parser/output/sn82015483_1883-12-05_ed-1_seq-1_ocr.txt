f : : : - " TUB LAUGE3T DAILY MKW8PAPER IN THE CITY. OFFICE 40O STATES STREET. Published by CABBIKQTON A CO. NEW HAVEN, CONN,, WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 5. 1883. Price Three Cents VOL LI. 1 . W Mam & Co. There is a great deal of talk throughout the oountry of doll trade. It may be so, bat our experience is to the oontrary. We have sold considerably more goods during October and November than we did in the same months last year. Is Cloaks especially we have been doing an excellent business. Tfiis we attribute to the fact that oar stock consisted entirely of new goods, and that we had the eiolnsive sale in New Haven of the garments of a certain manufacturer, who seemed to have hit the prevailing taste and fashion in a very felicitous manner. We recommend especially to the attention of onr lady patrons the very superior style, quality and fit of onr long Jersey garments, Newmarkets, Victorias, Ao., and wonld call attention also to the low prices on onr flns Seal Flash Sacqaes and Cloaks. In our Dress Goods department we offer some extraordinary value in 6-4 Ladies' Cloths, and in Styliah Plaid Dress Goods. It is no use quoting prices, as in all such merchandise the quality muBt be seen before the cheapness can be appreciated. In low priced Dress Goods, from 60 to 30o, we have some very extraordinary value. Knit Goods, Felt Flannel Skirts, Winter Underwear and Hosiery have been selling at a rate that made it quite plain that we were making the lowest prices in the city. You may advertise what you like, if your prices are not right you will not get the trade, at least not in an intelligent community like that of New Haven. And we HAVE BEEN and ARE getting the trade to aa extent that ia very gratifying tow. - We have some bargains in Shawls. Have you seen them ? If not, you should, before the weather gets any colder. Speaking of cold weather reminds ns of Blankets. That we have done the Blanket trade of New Haven this fall has been admitted even by our competitors. It is not often in these days of close competition that one can get so clear an advantage over all of one's competitors as we did get this year. It was a great stroke, and has had most satisfactory results, both ia increasing onr business and in. supplying the people of New Haven with Blankets at the lowest prioes ever heard of or ever likely to be heard of. We have still some to sell, not many now however. Daring this week we shall open a large and varied stock of Books and Fancy articles for the holiday trade ; a larger and better Btook than we ever showed before. We don't mean to say much about this in an advertisement, as they and the prices on them will be in them selves our best advertisement. If oar books sell as rapidly as .they did last year it would be wasting money to advertise them at all. But we have a maoh larger stock this time. Come and see them. Ladies who are making up Fanoy Work for Christmas Gifts will find some very oheap and at the same time very suitable materials for such purposes in the remnant box at the end of onr ribbon counter, where are short lengths of fancy, satin, plash, ottoman and other Rib bons, at a mere fraction of original cost we repeat, because we mean you to understand it literally, a mere fraction of original cost. Then there are on oar ooanters such things as Colored Felts, Fanoy Flannels, silk and cotton Plushes, fine Crash, Antique and other Laoes, stamped Linens, Cretonnes, and many other things need in getting up the thousand and one pretty things which ladies make for their friends at this season.

Wednesday, December 5, 1883. THK MESsAOK. President Arthur's message to Congress, delivered yesterday, is not very short, bat it is mora readable than such documents n anal ly are. There is mnoh in it also that will command general approval, and increase the esteem in which the President is held. The message begins with a review ef for eign affairs, which includes bat little that is notable. The President sajs that there Is good reason to believe that the law restrict ing immigration of Chinese has been violated, intentionally or otherwise, by the officials of China upon whom is devolved the duty of certifying that the immigrants belong to the excepted olassea. He things that it might be advisable to provide some means of equitable retaliation in onr relations with governments which discriminate against onr own. For example, the executive might be empowered to apply to Spanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and Porto liico the same rules Of treatment and scale of penalties for techni cal faults which are applied to oar vessel and oargoes in the Antilles. A discretionary authority to forbid the importation of arti cles of consumption iojarious to health might, he thinks, be advantageously exer oised in oar dealings with such countries as inequitably discriminate against our food produots. This will please those who do not like the way the American hog has been treated by Germany and France. The President deals interestingly with the matter of the large national revenues. He does not, hswever, advise the adoption at this session of any measures for great dim inution of those revenues, as the results of the legislation of the last session of Congress have not as yet beoome sufficiently apparent to justify any radical revision or sweeping modification of existing laws. Associated with this matter ia the question what legisla tion is needed regarding the national curren cy. If the surplus eontinues to grow the currency will be in danger of contraction by the retirement of a large amount of the three per cent bonds, which are payable at the pleasure of the government. The Presi dent thinks there should be a law enaoted re pealing the tax on circulation, and permitting the banks to issue notes for an amount equal to ninety per cent, of the market value in stead of as now the faoe value of their de posited bonds. This he believes would afford the necessary relief, and would be better than the issuing of new bonds having many years to ran, bearing a low rate of interest, and exchangeable upon specified terms with those now outstanding. Among the other recommendations are that measures be taken to better proteot our extensive seacoast; that the State militia or ganisations be encouraged by the national government; that the navy b) put into a state ef efficiency; that the rate of po3tage upon "drop" letters be reduced to one cent; and that the government keep out of the tel egraph business. The Mormon question is firmly dealt with. It is pointed out that all the members of the Utah legislature are Mormons, and that there is grave reason to believe that they e in sympathy with the practices that the government is seeking to suppress, and that its effort in that regard will be more likely io encounter their opposition than reoeive their encouragement and support. "I am con vinced," says the President, "that polygamy has beoome so strongly intrenched in the territory that it is profitless to attack it with any but the stoutest weapons which con stitutional legislation oan fashion. I favor, therefore, the repeal of the act upon whioh the existing government depends, the as sumption by the national legislature of the entire political oontrol of the territory, and the establishment of a commission with snoh powers and duties as shall be delegated to It bylaw." This is substantially the plan proposed by Governor Murray of Utah. The "railroad problem" receives attention but it is treated very caref ally. The protec tion of the forests situated upon the public domain is urged. Of Civil Service reform the President says that he is persuaded that its effects thus far have proved benefioial. The need of doing something to fully provide for the presidential suoeession is referred to. The recent decision against the Civil Bights act is noticed, and the President says: "Any legislation whereby Congress may lawfully supplement the guarantees which the consti tution affords for the equal enjoyment by all the citizens ef the United States of every right, privilege and immunity of citizenship, will receive my unhesitating approval." President Arthur has always been a firm friend of the negro. These are the main points of the message, whioh, as a whole, Is able, forcible and wise ElUTOItlAl. 

MUTKH. By the death of Henry O. Hotchkiss and Frederio Ives yesterday New Haven lost two eitizens whom she oan ill afford to spare. The work of the land sub-commissioners In fixing the rents In Ireland nnder the ar rears act has been finished. The amount ordered to be paid was a little less than $5, 000,000 , while some $10,000,000 of arrears has been cancelled. A Washington paper has the following in teresting advertisement: "The prayers of God's people are most earnestly requested for the thorough pur ifioation of a young church whose pastor and officers are inveterate tobaooo-nsers, much against the wishes of its members." A fine defence is that offered by tbe man who killed Policeman Bullard in Detroit. He ays that he was asleep when he killed the policeman, and therefore was not responsible for his act. According to his . own account of the affair, after committing the murder he Immediately left the neighborhood of his crime ; walked past the ferry boats te the ap-river end of the oity ; hired a man to row him aoroas in a small boat ; hid his weapon in a swamp and ooneealed himself in a barn, utterly ignorant of what he had done until he saw it in the paper. Fran Gallmeyer lately petitioned the Em peror Francis Joseph for the remission of a am ef six thousand florins due by her to the commune ef Vienna for unpaid taxes, alleg ing, among other reasons for her inability to pay, the unprofitableness of her American tour. Beveral German papers having im. proved the occasion to warn German actors against the disappointments which generally wait them beyond the Atlantic, Herr A. Easch, the theatrical agent who brought about the American engagements of Gall meyer, Geistinger, and othsr German ae treeses and actors, publisher the following fignres as Ulastrative of those "disappoint ments": Frao Geistinger received in 1881 for her. lour months' engagement, f 38,000, in 1882 for six months, $60,000; Fran Gallmey er netted in the season of 18S2 $14,000, be sides all her boarding expenses paid; Herr Enaaek reoeived daring the same time $9,000 and Herr Tewels for less than three months f 8,000. ! THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To the Gongrtn of the United State: ., . At the threshold of your deliberations I congratulate you upon the favorable aspect of the domestio and foreign affairs of this government. . Our relations with other coun tries continue to be upon a friendly footing. With the Argentine .Republic, Belgium, Bra zil, Denmark, Hayti, Italy, Santo Domingo and Sweden and Norway no incident has oc curred whioh calls for special comment. The recent opening of new lines of telegraphic communication with Central America and Brazil permitted the interehange of messages of friendship with the governments of those countries. Daring the year there have been perfected and proclaimed cons alar and com mercial treaties with Servia, and a consular with Rouniania, thus extending our interest with the Danubian ooantrics, 'while oar east ern relations have been pat npon a wider basis by treaties with Corea and Madagascar. The new boundary survey treaty with Mexi co, a trades mark convention, and a supple mentary treaty of extradition with Spain, and conventions extending the duration of the Franco-American claims commission have also been proclaimed. Notice of the termination of the fisheries articles of the treaty of Washington was duly gives to the British government and the reciprocal privi leges and exemptions of the treaty will ao oordingly cease on July 1, 1885. The fisheries industries, pursued by a numerous olass of our citizens on the northern coasts both of the Atlantio and Paoifio oceans, are worthy of the fostering oare of Congress. When ever brought into competition with the like in dustries of other countries, onr fishermen, as well as onr manufaeturers of fishing ap pliances and preparers of fish products, have maintained a foremost place. I suggest that Congress create a commission to consider the general question of our rights in the fisheries and tbe means of opening to oar citizens un der jaBt and enduring conditions the riohly stooked fishing waters and sealing grounds of British and Bussian North America. 

PAT7PEB EUIOBANTS. A question has arisen teaching the disposi tion by the United States of persons coming from the British islands, by governmental or municipal aid, nnable to gain a living, and equally a burden on the community here Such of these persons as were of the pauper olass as defined by law have been sent back in accordance with the provisions of oar statutes. Her majesty's government has in sisted that precautions have been taken be fore shipment, which have, however, in many oases proved ineffectual, and especially so in all recent instances of needy emigrants reaching our territory through Canada, that a revision of our legislation upon this sub ject may be advisable. Correspondence rela tive to the Clayton-Bolwer treaty has been oontinued and will be laid before Congress. v VABIOUS rOBEIGN AFFAIRS. The legislation of France against the im portation of prepared swine produots from the United States has been repealed. That result has been due less to the friendly rep resentations of this government than to a growing conviotion in France that the re striction is not demanded by any real danger to health. Germany still prohibits the in troduction of all swine products from Amer ica. - I extended to the imperial government a friendly invitation to send experts to tbe United States to inquire whether the use of these products was dangerous to health. This invitation was deolined. I have be lieved it of such importance, however, that the exaot facts should ba ascertained and promulgated that I nave appointed a compe tent commission to make a thorough investi gation of the subject. Its members havs shown their publio spirit by aeoepting their trust without pledge of compensation, but I trust tht Congress will see in the national and international bearings of the matter a sufficient motive fer providing at least for reimbursement of such expenses as they may necessarily inour. The ooronation of tbe Czar at Moscow afforded to this govsrnment an occasion for testifying its oontinued friendship by sending a special envoy and a representative of the navy to attend the cer emony. While there have arisen daring the hearing questions affecting the status in the Russian empire of. American citizens of other-faith than, that held.. by. the national ohuroh, this government remains firm in its convictions that the standing of its citizens abroad should be in no way affeoted by their religious belief. It is understood that measures for the re moval of the restrictions which now burden oar trade with Cuba and Porto Bioo are un der consideration by. the Spanish govern ment. The proximity of Cuba, and tbe pe culiar methods of administration which there prevail, necessitate constant discussion or appeal on our part from the proceedings of the insular authorities. I regret to say that just protests of this government have not as yet prodaced satisfactory results. The com mission appointed to decide certain claims of our citizens agatnst the Spanish government. after the recognition of such a satisfactory rule as the validity and the force of naturali zation in the United States, has finally ad journed. Some of its awards, though made more than ten years ago, nave not yet been paid. 'J heir speedy pavmant Is expeoted. Claims to a large amount, whioh were held by the commission to be without its lurisdio tion, have been diplomatically presented to the Spanish government. As tbe action of the colonial authorities, whioh has given rise to those claims, was admittedly illegal, full reparation for the injury sustained by onr citizens should be no longer delayed. The case of the Masonic has not reached a settlement. The Manilla court has found that the proceedings of which this govern ment has complained were authorized, and it is hoped that the government of Spain will not withhold the speedy reparation which its sense of justice should impel it to offer lor the usual security and uniust action of its subordinate colonial offloers in the case of this vessel. The Helvetian ooafederation has proposed the inauguration of a olass of international treaties for the referment to ar bitration of grave questions between nations This government has assented to the proposed negotiation of soeh a treaty with Switzer land. Under the treaty of Berlin liberty of conscience and oivil rights are assured to all strangers in Bulgaria. As the United States have no distinot conventional relations with that country and are not a party to the treaty, they should, in my opinion, maintain diplomatic representation at Sofia for the im provement of intercourse and the proper pro lection of the many American citizens who resort to that country as missionaries and teachers. I sacgest that I be given authority to establish an agency and consular general at the Bulgarian oapital. The UnitedStates are now participating ia a revision or the tariffs of the Ottoman empire. They have assented to the application of a license tax to foreigners doing business in Turkey, but have opposed the oppressive storage tax upon petroleum entering the ports of that country. The government of the iLhedrve has proposed that the authority of the mixed judicial tribunals in Egypt be extended so as to cover citizens of the United States aooused of crime, who are now tried before consular courts. This government is not indisposed to accept the change, but be lieves that its terms should be submitted for criticism to the commission appointed to re vise the whole subject. MEXICO. At no time in onr national history has there been more manifest need of close and lasting relations with a neighboring State than now exists with respect to Mexico. The rapid influx of our oapital and enterprise into that country shows by what has already been accomplished the vast reciprocal advantages which mast attend the progress of its inter nal development. The treaty of eommeroe and navigation of 1848 has been terminated by the Mexioan government and in the ab sence of conventional engagements the rights of our oltizens in Mexieo now depend npon the domestio statutes of that republic There have been instances of harsh enforcement of the laws against our vessels and citizens In Mexieo and of denial of the diplomatic resort for their protection. The initial step tow ard a better understanding bas been taken in negotiations by the commission authorized by Congress of a treaty whioh is still before the Senate awaiting its approval. Tbe pre visions for the reciprocal crossing of the frontier by troops in pursuit of hostile In dians have been prolonged for another year. The operations of the forces of both govern ments against the savages have been success ful, and several of their most dangerous bands have been captured or dispersed by the skill and valor of United States and Mex ican soldiers fighting in a common cause. The convention for the resurvey of the boundary from the Bio Grande to the Paoifio having been ratified and ex changed, the preliminary - reconnais sance therein stipulated has been effected. It now rests with Congress to make provision for completing the bound ary monuments. A convention was signed with Mexico on Jnly 13, 1883, providing for the rehearing of the oaees of Benjamin Weil and the Abra Silver Mining company, in whose favor awards were made by the late American and Mexican claims commission. That convention still awaits the consent of the Senate, Meanwhile, because of the charges of fraodulent swards, whioh have made new commission necessary, the executive has directed the suspension of payments of the distributive uotft received from Mexico, I SOUTH AMZBIOA. Our geographical proximity to Central America, and our political and commercial relations with the States of that oountry. Jus tify, in my judgment, euch a material in crease of our oonsular corps aa will place at each capital a consul general. The contest between Bolivia, Chili and Peru has passed from the stage of strategic hostilities to that of negotiation, in whioh the counsels of this government have been exercised. The de mands of Chili for absolute cession of terri tory have been maintained and accepted by the party of General Iglesias to the extent of concluding a treaty of peace with the gov ernment of Chili in. general conformity with the terms of the protocol signed in May last between the Chilian commander and General Iglesias. As a result of the conclusion of this treaty General Iglesias has been formally recognized by Chili as pres ident of Pern and his government in stalled at Lima, which, has been evacuated by the Chilians. A call has been issued by General Iglesias for a representative as sembly to be elected on the 13th of January and to meet at lima on the 1st of March next. Meanwhile the provisional govern ment of General Iglesias has applied for rec ognition to the principal powers of America and Europe. When the will of the Peruvian people shall be manifested I shall not hesi tate to recognize tbe government approved by them. Diplomatic and naval representa tives in this government attended, at Oarac oas, the centennial celebration of the birth of the illustrious Bolivar. At the same time the inauguration of the statue of Washington in the Venezuelan capital testified to the venera tion in whioh his memory was held there. Congress, at its last session, authorized the executive to propose to the Venezuelan gov ernment a reopening of the awards of the fixed commission of Caraccas. The departure from this country of the Venezuelan min ister has delayed the opensng of negotiations for reviving the commission. This govern ment holds that until the establishment of a treaty upon this subject the Venezuelan gov ernment must continue to make the payments provided for in the convention of 18G6. There is ground for believing that tbe dis pute growing out of obligations due from Venezuela to France will be satisfactorily ad justed ; the French cabinet has proposed a basis of settlement which meets my approval. Bat as it involves a recasting of the annual quotas of the foreign debt, it has been deemed advisable to submit the proposal to the judgment of the cabinets of Berlin, Co penhagen, the Hague, London and Madrid. At the recent ooronation of his majesty King Ealakaua, this government was represented both diplomatically and by the formal visit of a vessel of war to the Sandwich Islands. The question of terminating or modifying the existing reciprocity treaty with Hawaii is now before Congress. I am convinced that the charges of abuse and frauds under that treaty have been exaggerated, and I renew the suggestion of last year's message that the treaty be modified wherever itn provis ions have proved onerous to legitimate trade between the two countries. I am not dis posed to favor the entire eessation of treaty relations, which have fostered good will be tween the countries and contributed toward the equality of Hawaii in the family of na tions. THE EASTEBN NATIONH. . In pursuance of the policy declared by this government of extending our intercourse with the eastern nations, legations have dur ing the past year been established in Persia, Siam and Corea. It is probable that perma nent missions of those countries will, ere long, be maintained in the United States. A special embassy from Siam is now on its way hither. Treaty relations with Corea were perfected by tbe exchange at Lsoul on the 19th of May last of the ratifications of the lately concluded convention, and envoys from the king of Lah. Chosun have visited this country and received a cordial welcome. Corea, as yet unacquainted with the methods of western civilization, now invites the at tention of those interested in the advance ment of our foreign trade, as it needs tbe implements and products which the United States are ready to supply. We seek no mo nopoly of its commerce and no advantages over other nations ; . but as the Chinese, in reaching for a higher civilization, have con tided in this republio,we cannot regard'with indifference any encroachments on their rights. China, by the payment of a money indemnity, has settled certain of tbe long-pendiag claims of our oitizeca, and I have strong hopes that the remainder will soon be adjusted. Questions have arisen as to such of the rights ot Amerioan and other foreienlmanufactarersin China under the pro visions of treaties, which permit aliens to excise their industries in that oountry. On this speoifio point our own treaty is silent. But nnder the operation of the most favored nation olanse, we have like privileges with those of other powers. While it is the duty of tbe government to see that our citizens have the full enjoyment of every benefit secured by treaty, I doubt the expediency of leading in a movement to constrain China to admit an interpretation which we have only an lndi reot treaty right to exact. The transference to China of American capital for the employ ment there of Chinese labor would in effeot inaugurate a competition for the oontrol of markets now supplied by our home indus tries. There is good reason to believe that the law restricting the immigration of Chi nese has been violated intentionally or oth erwise by the officials of China, upon whom is devolved tbe duty of certifying that the immigrants belong to the excepted classes Measures have been taken to ascertain the faats incident to this supposed infraction, and it is believed that the government of China will co-operate with the Unite! States in sscaring the faithful observance of tbe law. The same considerations which prompted Congress at its last session to re turn to Japan the Simoneski indemnity seem to me to require at its hands like action in respect to the Canton indemnity fund, now amounting to $300,000. The question of the general revision of foreign treaties by Japan has been considered in ao international conference held at Tokio, but without definite result aa yet This govern ment is disposed to concede the requests of Japan to determine its own tariff duties, to provide suoh proper judicial tribunals as may commend themselves to the western powers for the trial of causes to whioh foreigners are parties, and to assimilate the terms and duration of its treaties to those of other civ ilized States. AFRICA. Throuch our ministers at London and at Monrovia the government bas endeavored to aid Liberia in its differences with ttreat Britain touching the northwestern bounda ries of that republic. There is a prospect of the adjustment of tbe dispute by the adop tion of the Mannih river as tbe line. This arrangement is a compromise of the conflict ing territorial claims and takes from Liberia no oountry ov. r which it has maintained ef fective jurisdiction. The rich and populous valley of the Congo is being opened to com merce by a society called the International African association, of which the King of the Belgians is prcaident, and a oitizen of the United States the chief exeontive omoer. Large traots of territory have been ceded to the association by native chiefs, roads have been opened, steamboats placed on the river and the nuclei of States established at twenty-two stations under one flag whioh offers freedom to commerce ana prohibits tne slave trade. The object of the sooiety are philan thropic. It does not aim at permanent po litical control, but seeks the neutrality of the valley. The United States cannot be indif ferent to their work, nor to the rights of their citizens involved in lit. It may become advisable for;us to co-operate with other com mercial powers in promoting the rights of trade and residence in the Congo valley free from the interference of political oontrol of any one nation. In view of tbe frequency of invitation from foreign governments to participate in social and scientific congresses for the dis cussion of important matters of general con cern, I repeat the suggestion of my last mes sage that provision be made for the exercise of discretionary power by the executive in-ap pointing delegates to suoh conventions.. Able specialists are r eady to serve tbe national in terests in suoh .capacities, without personal profit or other compensation than the de fraying of expenses actually inenrred, and this a comparatively small annual appropriation would suffice to meet. I have alluded in my previous message to the injurious and vexations restrictions suffered by oar trade in the Spanish West Indies, be- oause the natural outlet for its great national staple, coffee, is in and through the United States and it imposes a heavy export duty npon that product. A like narrow polioy is pursued in other Amerioan countries. Our petroleum exports are hampered in Turkey and in other eastern ports by restriction as to storage and by onerous taxation, and the free outward movement of onr great food pro duots is ia some quarters clogged with like impediments. For these mischiefs adequate relief is not always afforded by reciprocity treaties like that with Hawaii, or that lately negotiated with Mexico and now awaiting the action of the Senate. Is it not advisable to provide some means of equitable retaliation in our relations with governments which dis criminate against oar own. If, for example, the exeoative were empowered to apply to Spanish vessels and oargoes from Cuba and Porto Bioo tbf game tales of treatment and i Boales of penalties for technical faults which are applied to our vessels and cargoes in the Antilles, a resort to that coarse might not be barren of good results. A discretionary au thority to forbid the importation of artioles of consumption injurious to health might be advantageously exercised in our dealings with such countries as inequitably discrimi nate against our food products. THB TEEA8CKT. The report of the Secretary of the Treas ury gives a full and interesting exhibit of the financial condition of the country.

If the revenue for the fiscal year which will end June 30, 1885, will be estimated np on the basis of existing laws, the Secretary is of the opinion that for that year the re ceipts will exceed sixty million dollars. Hith erto the surplus, as rapidly as it had accum ulated, has been devoted to the reduction ot the national debt. As a result the only bonds now outstanding which are redeemable at tbe pleasure of government are 3 per cents, amounting to about $305,000,000. The ii per cents., amounting to $250,000,000, and the $737,000,000 4 per cents, are not payable until 1891 and 1907 respectively. If the sur plus shall hereafter be as large as the treasu ry estimates now indicate, the three per cent, bonds may all be redeemed at least four years before any of the 4 J per cents, oan be called in. THE 

NATIONAL REVENUES. The latter, at tbe same rate of accumula tion of surplus, can be paid at maturity, and the moneys requisite for the redemption of the 4 per cents, will be In tke treasury many years before tbo?e obligationa become parable. There are cogent rea sons, however, why the national Indebtedness should not be thos rapidly extinguished. Chief among them is the fact that only by ecealve taxation is euch rspidity attainable In a commuuicttlon to Con gress at r s last session, I recommended that all excise tsxes be sbollshed, except those relating to distilled spirits, and that xubstautlal reductions also be made in revenue from cuatomK. A statute bas since been enaoted by which anuual tax and tariff receipts of the governmeat bave been cnt down to the exteot of at least fl ty or sixty millions ot 'dollars. White I have no deubt that still further reductions mtty be wissly made, I do not advts? tbe adoption of th's session of any measures for large diminution of the natloDal revenues. The results of the It gisUtion at the last session of Congress havd not ss yet beoome scmcient ly apparent to justify any rid'cal revision or Bffoop ing modification of existing laws. In the interval whioh m jst elapne before the effects of the aot of March 3, 1881, can ba definitely ascer tained a portion at least of tbe surplus revenues may be wisely applied to the long neglected duty of reha blli atlng our nation and providiog coast defences for the pretectlon of our harbors. Tbis is a matter to whioh I shall again advert. Immediately asrociat ed with the financial subject just discussed is the im portant question what legislation la needed regarding the national currency. The aggregate amount of bonds now on deposit in the treasury to support the national bank circulation is about $350,000,900. Near ly $200,0n0,000 of this amount consists of 3 per cents., which, aa already stated, are payable at the pleasure of the government, and are likely to be called iu within less than four yearu, nuleaa meantime the sur plus revenues shall be diminished. The probable ef fect of such an extensive retirement o the securities, vhlch ara the basis of tho national b.nk circulation, wonld be such a contraction of the volume of the cur rency as to produce gr-ve commercial embarrassment. How can the danger be obviated? Tbe m.- a.t effectual plan and one whose adoption at the earliest practic able opportunity I sbali heart! y approve has already been indicated. If the revenue of the nxt four years sbali be kept substantially ooaimcnsurate with the expanses, the volume of circu'ation will not be lisely to suffer any material disturbance, but if qu the other hand there alxall b great delay in reducing tax at inn, it will become necesssry either to substitute soma other form of curreaoy in place of the national bank notes, or to make important otangea in the laws by which their circulation fa now oontrol led. In my judgment the latter oouree is far preferable. I com mend to your attention the very Interesting and thoughtful suggestions upon this subject which ap pear In the secretary's report. The objeotiona which he nrgee aaalnst tbe acceptance of any other securl- I ties than the obligation! of the government ItaeU &b a foundation, lot national bask circulation sem to ma fnsiinarable for avartina tbe threaanA w,nMA tlon. Two courses have b&eu suggested, either of which is prooaoiy isasiDie. une is tne iauance of new bonds having many years to run, bearing a low rate of interest, and exchangeab.e upon specified teraaa with those now outs ending. The other course, whioh commends itself to my cwn judgment as bei ter.is the enactment of a law repealing the tax on cir culation, and permitting the banks to Issue notes for an amount eqnal to 90 per cent, ef the market value Instead of as now the faoe value of their deposited bonds. X agree with the secretary In the belief that the adoption ef this plan would afford the neoeeaary relief. The trade dollar waa coined for, tbe purpose of traffic In oountrits where silver pas fed at its value as ascertained by its weight and fineness. It never bed a legal tender quality. Large numbers of these coins entered, however, into the volume of onr cur rency. By oommon consent their circulation in do mestio trade has now ceased and they have thus be oome a disturbing element. They should not be longer permitted to embarrass our surrency system. I reooaimend that provision for their reception by the treasury and the mints aa bullion at a small per centage above the current market prtoa'of ailver of like fineness be made. The Secretary of the Treasury advises a consolida tion ot oertaln of the customs districts of tbe coun try, and suggests that the President be vested witn such power' in relation thereto as Is now given him la resrect to collections of internal revenue by eeo- t on 3,141 of thi revised statutes. The statistics on this subject, which ere contained in his rsport, fur nish of themselves a strong argument In defense of his views. At the adjournment of Congress the num ber of Internal revenue districts was la). By execu tive order dated June 20, 1883, I directed that oertaia of these dlstriofe be oonsolidatM. The result has been a reduction of one-third their somber, whioh at present is bat OS. THB 

INDIAN QUESTION. From the report of the Secretary of War it will be seen that in only a single instance baa there been any disturnenoe oz tne quiet conainon of onr Indian tribes a raid from Meiioo Into Arizona bv a small party of Indians, which was pursued by General Crook Into the mountain Melons from which It had come. It is oonfidently hoped that a serious outbreak will not again oocur and that the Indian tribes which bave for so many years disturbed the West will here after remain in peaceable submission. foojrnKTOD ox youaia pack Hoop's .
