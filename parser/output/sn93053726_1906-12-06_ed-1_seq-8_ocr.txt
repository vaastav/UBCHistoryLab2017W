SQUIRTED ACID ON THE HORSES. knltnmaa Practices Used Against Mea and Animal. During the Team sters' Strike of J 009 In A ;. . Chicago. CIIICAGO, Dec, 6. Exposure of the methods employed by teamsters to try to win1 a strike In 1905 was given here In the; trial of President Cornelius P. - Shea of the teamsters' union and his fellow labor leaders before Judge Ball !n the criminal court by Joseph Schultz, It slugger, who with Albert Young turned state's evidence. Schnltz, while on thetnnd a wit ness for the state, declared that Shea had told him to break the legs and . arms of the strike breakers and espe cially to attack the negroes. When this means of bringing about desired results did not work satisfactorily, Schultz asserted that Shea ordered the hired pickets to throw eggshells filled with acids at horses driven by ; nonunion men. The acid throwers, ac cording to Schultz, were responsible for many runaways and were regard- r ed as a great aid In the fight against t the employers. Schultz was asked by Assistant State Attorney Miller: v " "What did Mr. Shea say concerning 1 negroes?" "He said, Break their legs or their . arms so they won't be able to work.' "Do you remember in the early part ! Of April, 1005, seeing three' negroes coming out of the alley back of the tore of Montgomery, Ward & Co.?" "Yes," replied Schultz. "I saw the men, and Shea was there. As they passed us Shea said to me: There Is one of the "finks." Get him when he comes a little further.' We caueht him about a block away and slugged him. A man named Scully was with me." "After that where did you go?' "I went down to South Water street i We saw some more 'finks' and follow ed them to a street car In Wabash avenue. I saw Jerry McCarthy, the business agent of the Truck Drivers' union, on the car, and I told him. He said, 'Get one of them if you can. I took the car brake and beat one of them. After that we went to the barn of Montgomery, Ward & Co." "What did you do there?" "We threw a few bricks." Schultz said that during the strike the strikers and the pickets would hurl eggs filled with vitriol and- other adds at horses In the streets to make them run away. He said that some times syringes were used to squirt the acid. - "They gave us the acid eggs at the pickets' headquarters," he said. The eggs had been drained and the shells filled with acid. The hole was cover ed with court plaster. "Shea came into the room," said the witness, "and said. Take these and use them, boys, but be careful not to get caught or you will be hanged.' " Schultz declared that he saw acid thrown on a horse belonging to Mont- j goruery, ard & Co. It ran away and was so wild with pain that five police men could scarcely hold It.

Californiana Satisfied President Had No Intention ot Forcing- Japs oa State Army Only to Stop Mob Violence. WASHINGTON,. Dec. C-Without debate the senate adopted a resolution calling on the secretary of commerce and labor to furnish the senate copies of all official letters, telegrams, re ports, etc., filed in the department In connection with the Investigation of the matter of the Japanese attending the public schools of San Francisco. The resolution was presented by Sena tor Flint (Cal.). The president confidently expects to be able to settle the troublesome prob lem that has arisen because of the dis crimination against Japanese in the schools ot San Francisco. Neither he nor any other member of the adminis tration has the remotest idea that there will be war or even a breach of the friendly relations between Japan and this country. The California delegation in congress has repeived what they consider satis factory assurance that the president did not desire to be understood as say ing In the Japanese section of his mes sage that he would use the military force of the United States In forcing Japanese into the California schools in which white children are taught. It Is said to have been his purpose to convey the idea that he would use the military to protect Japanese against mob violence. Californians take no of fense at this interpretation of the mes sage and agree that the chief executive should do everything in his power to protect Japanese as well as all other . foreigners against violence. 'This whole San Francisco affair Is proving to be a tempest iu a teapot," Representative Julius Kahn said. "It will die out rapidly as soon as there is a general understanding as to why California takes the position it does. "The courts and not the public must settle all the legal questions Involved In the San Francisco school situation." That the president's views on the subject meet with the hearty approval of the Japanese government was made evident when Viscount Aokl, the Japa nese ambassador, yesterday personally thanked the president for what he had said in his message regarding the vexed question. Postmaster' General George B.'Cor telyou will be confirmed as secretary of the treasury within a few days, as there is no disposition on the part of the senate to refuse him confirmation. '

SOLOMONVILLE, Ariz, ' Dee. 8.- As the result of thirty hours' steady rain over southern Arizona the min ing town of Clifton, with 3,000 popula tion, was swept by a terrific flood, and hundreds of inhabitants have fled to the mountains for safety. Owing to disabled wires details are hard to ob tain, but the known dead reaches eight een. Most of the population are Mexi cans and Italians, whose huts are now Inundated. ', , The catastrophe began with the breaking of , a big reservoir In the mountains, precipitating a vast flood on the Chase creek quarter of Clifton. The principal street was rained. It was along this street that the fatalities occurred, as the flood came in a bead and engulfed the people without warn ing. The dead are mostly foreigners whose names cannot be learned. Two Americans are known to have perished, one being caught on a pile of wreckage and drowned. North and south Clifton are swept by the current of the San Francisco riyer. . A new school building and a score of houses 'were washed away. The railroad bridge Is tottering. All In formation is sent out from a telephone office surrounded by water. - The great smelting plant of the Arizona Copper works at Clifton is said to have been greatly damaged. The Arizona and New Mexico Railway company will also be a heavy loser, as its yards and shops are inundated. ; Two bodies were recovered from the wreckage along Chase creek, but the ' exact number of deaths cannot be told. Joe Throm, who was rescued from the flood and whose wife was lost was taken to the hospital In a serious con dition, but will probably recover. Three men were caught looting and on refusal to surrender were shot and fa tally wounded by officers. ' ' So many restaurants and hotels have been destroyed that it is almost Impos sible to find a place to eat or to sleep In the town. . All trains on the Arizona and New Mexico railroad are held up. Earthquake Panlo at St. Vlneent. KINGSTOWN. Island of St Vincent West Indies, . Dec. 6. A prolonged earthquake shock was' felt here, which lasted fully eighty seconds. The vibra tions were slow. The people of Kings town were thrown into a panic. No other shock felt here has ever lasted so long. The island of Barbados, about a hundred miles to the east and the islund of St. Lucia, about twenty-five miles to the northwest also felt the shock. It was most severe on the is lund of St Lucia. There has been a continuation of earthquake shocks here at irregular Intervals and of varying severity since last February. Like a frasy Quilt, Says Crosscap. BALTIMORE, Dec. C-Judge Feter S. Grosscup of the United States court of appeals for northern Illinois, who Is now in Baltimore on a visit, said of President Roosevelt's message: "It's like a crazy quilt It covers almost ev ery possible subject, and many of them are hardly important enough for a president s message."

GOLD CUP DISPUTE Turftnen Deolde Major Delmar " Won on His Merita. LOU DILLON WAS SOT DRUGGED. Sensational 'Testimony In Famous Lawsalt Between Racing Men. R. E. Smuthera of New York ' Is Exonerated. NEW YORK, Dec. 6. The Memphis gold cup dispute was officially ended last night when the board of review of the National Trotting-association decided that the trophy had been .won on merit aud dismissed the charges against Elmer E. Smathers, the New York horseman, r ; , The case, which was taken up by the board at a continuation of its win ter meeting, grew out of the alleged drugging of Lou Dillon at the Mem phis (Tenn.) meet on Oct 18, 1904. Smathers, who owned Major Delmnr and drove him in the race; was charg ed with having been cognizant of ill treatment of C. K. G. Billings' mare which resulted in the letter's with drawal from the race and the win ning of the $5,000 gold cup by Major Delmar. When the charges were made suit was brought by the Memphis as sociation, but it was stopped by' In junction. ' The present hearing was for the purpose of determining the facts. Some of the testimony w$s sensa tional. One affidavit read was made by Ed Saunders, who originally made the charges against Smathers. Saund- ; ers in bis earlier affidavit had sworn that Smathers had paid him $5,000 to Inject eight ounces of drug into Lou Dillon's body so as to stop her in the race. In the affidavit read from Saund ers he said that he was paid to make the charges against Smathers and that they were absolutely without founda tion. . . '. At the conclusion of the hearing John S. Wise, couusel for Smathers, made a bitter arraignment of the men who preferred the charges against his client mentioning particularly C. K. G. Billings, owner of Lou Dillon, and Murray Howe, secretary of the Mem phis Trotting association. : "It Is the same Billings who dined on horseback at Sherry's amid cherry blossoms and la-la-las," said Mr. Wise, "who instigated the infamous charges against Mr. Smathers, a man of unim peachable Integrity as a horseman. It Is a coward's prosecution." Edward Saunders and his brother Mallard, with George Spears, Mr. Wise said, ought to be kicked out of the trot ting association, He closed thus: . . "I feci that we have suffered long and patiently and bitterly. The charges are absolutely nnsustalned:'' And as to those others, Billings and Howe, that is a matter for further development, which later we will take under consid eration." . The executive session lasted hardly a quarter of an hour, and then Secre tary Gocher announced the decision, that the Memphis gold cup race was won on its merits and - the charges against Elmer E. Smathers dismissed. Break With Frcaek Governatent.
