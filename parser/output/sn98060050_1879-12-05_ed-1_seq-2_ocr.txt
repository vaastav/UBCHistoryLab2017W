THE VERMONT PHCENIX, BRATTLEBORO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER o, 1879. restoring the civil service to the desired puri ty ami efficiency rests upon tho President, anil It lift! been tny purpose to do what is within my power to tulvunco such prudent and gradual measures ol reform ns will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of system essential to mako our ad ministrative methods satisfactory to n free and Intelligent people, lly a proper exercise of authority it is in tho power of the Execu tive to do much to promote such a reform. But it cannot be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can bo accomplished with out co-operation ou tho part of Congress, mid considerate and intelligent support among tho people. Iteforms which challenge tho generally-accepted theories of parties, and demand changes in tho methods of depart ments, are not the work of a day. Their per manent foundations must be laid in sound principles, and in an experience which dem onstrates their wisdom and exposes tho errors of their adversaries. Every worthy officer desires to make his official action a gain and an honor to hit country, but the people them selves, far more than their officers in public station, are interested in a pure, economical, and vigorous administration. lly laws enacted in ls.Vl and 183.", and now in substance incorporated in tho revised Stat utes, tho practice of arbitrary appointments to the several subordinate gradeB iu tho great departments was condemmed, and examina tions as to capacity, to be conducted by de partmentat boards of examiners, were provid ed for and made conditions of admission to the public service. These statutes are a de cision by Congress that examinations of some sort as to attainments and capacity are esbeu tial to tho well-being of tho public service. The important questions since the enactment of these laws have been as to the character of these examinations, and whether official fa vor and partisan influence or common right and merit were to control tho access to the examinations. Iu practice, these examina tions have not always been open to worthy persons generally who might wish to bo ex amined ; official favoritism and partisan in fluence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go before the examining boards, subjecting even the examiners to a pressuro from the friends of the candidates very difficult to resist. As a consequence, tho standard of udniissiou fell below that which the puplic interest do niauded. It was almost inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards of examiners, with no common su pervision or uniform method of procedure, should result in confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests of capacity, highly detri mental to tho public interest. A further and more radical change was obviously required. Iu the annual messago of December, 187(1, my predecessor declared that "there is no duty which so much embarrasses the Execu tive aud heads of departments as that of ap pointments, nor is there any such arduous aud thankless labor imposed ou Senators and ltepresentatives as that of finding places for constituents. The present system dots not secure tho best men, and often not even fit men, for the public places. The elevation and purification of the civil service of the government will be hailed with approval by the- whole people of the United States." Congress accordingly passed tho act, ap proved March 3, 1871, "to regulate tho civil service of the United States and promote the efficiency thereof," giving the necessary au thority to tho Executive to institute a civil service reform. 

WOKE or THE COMMISSION. Acting under this statute, which was in terpreted as iuteuded to secure a system of just aud effectual examinations, uuder uni form supervision, a number of eminently competent persons were selected for the pur pose, who entered with zeal upon the dis charge of their duties, prepared with an in telligent appreciation of the requirements of tho service tho regulations contemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and who, in their capacity as a board, have been known as tho "Civil Service Commission." Con gress for two years oppropriateel the money needed for the compensation and for the ex pense of carrying on the commission. It ap pears from the rejiort of the commission, supmitted to the President in April, 1874, that examinations had been held in various sections of the country, and that an appro priation of about 425,000 .would be required to meet the annual expenses, iucludiuc: sala ries, involved in discharging the duties of the commission. The report was transmitted to Congress by special Messago of April 18, 1874, with the following favorable comment upon the labors of the commission : "If sustained by Con gress, I have no doubt the rules can, after the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as to still more materially benefit the public service and relievo the Executive, members of Congress, and the heads of de partments from influences prejudicial to good administration. Tho rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, havo resulted benefi cially, as is shown by tho opinions of the members of the Cabinet and their suboidinates iu the departments, and in that opinion I concur." And in the annual Message of December of the same yeor, simi lar views are expressed, and an appropria tion for continuing the work of the commit siou again odvised. The appropriation was not made, aud, as a consequence, the active work of tho commission was suspended, leav ing tho commission itself still in existence, without the means, therefore, of causing qualifications to bo tested in any systematic manner, or of securing for the public service the advantages of competition upon any ex tensive plan. I recommended in my annual Messago of December, 1877. the making of an appropriation for the resumption of the work of tho commission. In the meantime, however, competitive examinations, under many embarrassments, have bbeu conducted, within limited spheres, in the executive de partments at Washington, and in a number of the Custom Houses aud Post Offices of the principal cities of the country, with a view to further test their effects, and in every in stance they have been found to be as saluta ry as they are statod to havo been uuder the administration of my predecessor. I think the economy,- purity, aud efficiency of the public sen ico would be greatly promoted by their systematic introduction, wherever practica ble, throughout tho entire civil service of the Government, together with ample provision for their general supervision, in order to Be; cure consistency and uniform justice. He ports from tho Secretary of the Interior, from the Fostmaster.General, from the Postmas ter ill tho city of New York, where such ex aminations have been some time on tiial, and also from the Collector of tho Port, tho Naval Officer and the Surveyor iu that city, and from the Postmasters and Collectors iu sev. oral of tho other large citieB, show that the competitive system, where applied, has in va rious ways contributed to improve the public service. The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the general application of similar rules cannot fall to be of decided benefit to the service. Tho reports of tho Government of ficcrs in the city of New York, especially, boar decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations in their respective offices, showing that "these examinations and the excellent qualifications of those admitted to the servico through them, have had a marked incidental effect upon the persons previously in the service, and particularly up ou those aspiring to promotion. There has been, on tho part of these latter, an increased interest iu the work, and a desiro to extend acquaintance with it beyond a particular desk, and thus the morale of tho entire force has been raised. The examinations have been attended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope aud character of the tests aud the nieth od of determining tho results, and those vis itors havo, without exception, opproved the modes employed, and several of them have publicly attested their favorable opinion up. on such considerations." I deem it my dnty to renow the recommendation contained in my annual Message of December, 1877, re. questing Congress to make the necessary ap propriation for the resumption of the work of the Civil Service Commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing a moderate compensation to persons in the public ser vice who may perform extra labor upon or uuder the commission, as the Executive may direct, I am convinced that if a just and definite test of merit is enforced for admission to tho public servico and in making promotions, such abuses as removal without good cause and partisan and official interference with the proper exercise of the appointing power, will, in large measure, disappear. There are other administrative abuses to which the at tention of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan appointment and the constant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an absorbing and mis chievous political activity on the part of those thus appointed, which not only Interferes uithahe duo discharge of official duty, but Is incompatible with the freedom of elections. Not without warrant, in view of several of my predecessors In the Presidential office, and directly in accordance with the law of 1871, already cited, I endeavored, by regula tion ou the 22d of June, 1877, to put sonio reasonable limits to such abuses. It may not be easy, and it may never, per haps, be necessary to define with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of Federal officers, llut while their right to hold aud freely express their opinions cannot bo questioned, it is very plain that theyshouldncitherbeallowedtodcvoto to oth er subjects tho time needed fortho properdis charge of their official duties, nor to uso tho authority of their office to enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the political action of those who hold different opinions. Iteasous of justice and public policy quite analogous to those which forbid the use of official pow. cr for the oppression of tho private citizen impose upon the Government the duty of protecting its officers and agents from arbi trary exactions. In whatever aspects consid ered, the practico of making levies for party purposes upon tho salaries of officers is high ly demoralizing to the public service and dis creditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free as any other citizen to give his own money In aid of his opinions or his party, he should also bo os free as any other citizen to refuse to make such gifts. If sala ries are but a fair compensation for the time aud labor of the officers, it is gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made ex cessive in order that they may bear the tax, the excess is an iudirect robbery of tho pub lic funds. I recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present statutes as shall secure to those iu every grade of official life or public employment the protection with which a great and enlightened nation should guard those who are faithful to its 

RELATIONS WITII rOREION COUNTRIES. Our relations with foreigu counties have continued peaceful. With Great llritaiu there are Btill unsettled questions, growing out of the local laws of the maritime Prov inces aud the action of provincial authorities, deemed to be- iu derogation of rights secured by treaty to American fishe .men. The United States Minister in London has been instruct ed to present n demand for 410.1,30." 0-', in view of the damages received by American citizens at Fortune Day on tho ;thday of January, 1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the British government, and an early reply is anticipated. Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary ex amination, the subject of our participation in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty, will at once be brought to the atten tion of the llritish government, with u view to an early and permanent settlement of the vv hole question, which was only temporarily adjusted by tho Treaty of Washington. Ef. forts have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions found injurious to the exporta tion of cattle to the United Kingdom. Some correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving of life and property upon the lakes, which has resulted in im portant modifications of the previous regula tions of the Dominion government ou the subject in the interest of humanity aud com uu rce. In accordance w ith the joint resolu tion of the last session of Congress, Commis sioners were appointed to represent the United States at the two international exhibitions in Australia, one of which is in progress at Syd ney, and the other to be held next year at Melbourne. A desire has been expressed by our merchants and manufacturers interested in the growing and important trade with Au stralia that an increased provision should be made by Congress for the representation of our industries at the Melbourne Exhibition of next year, and the subject is respectfully submitted to your favorable consideration. The assent of tho Government has been given to tho lauding on the coast of Massa chusetts of a new aud independent transat lantic cable between Trance, by way of the French island of St. Tierre, and this country, subject to any future legislation of Congress on tho subject. The conditions imposed, be fore allowing this connection with our shores to be established, are such as to secure its competition with any existing or future lines of marine cable, and precludajimnlcamflfinn therewith. To prnvidn for f ntirp equality, of rights to our Government and people with those of France in the uso of tho cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the priv ilege as accorded by France to the disadvant age of any future cable communication be tween Franco and the United States which may be projected and accomplished by our citizens, an important reduction of the pres ent rates of cable communication with Eu rope, felt to be too burdensome to the inter ests of our commerce, must necessarily flow from the establishment of this competing line. The attention of Congress was drawn to tho propriety of some general regulation by Congress of tho whole subject of transma rine cables by my predecessor in his Message of Dec. 7. 187.", and I respectfully submit to your consideration the importance of Con gressional action in this matter. The questions of grave importance with Spain, growing out of tho incidents of the Cuban insurrection, have been, for the most part, happily and honorably settled. It may reasonably be anticipated that the commis sion, now sitting in Washington, for the de cision of private cases in this connection, will soon be able to bring its labors to a conclu sion. The long-standing question of East Florida claims has lately been renewed as a subject of correspondence, and may possibly require Congressional action for its final dis position. A treaty with the Netherlands, with respect to the consular rights and privileges, similar to those with other powers has been signed and ratified, and the ratifications were ex changed on the 31st of July last. Negotia tions for extradition treaties with tho Nether lauds and with Denmark are now in prog. resB. Some questions w ith Switzerland in regard to pauper and convict emigrants havo arisen, but it is not doubted that they will bo ar ranged upon a just and satisfactory basis. A question has also occurred with respect to an asserted claim by Swiss municipal authorities to exercise tutelage over persons and proper, ty of Swiss citizens naturalized in this coun try. It is possible this may require adjust ment by treaty. With tho German Empire frequent ques tions arise iu connection with the subjects of naturalization and expatriation, but the Im perial Government has constantly manifest ed u desire to strictly maintain and comply with all treaty stipulations in regard to them. In consequence of the omission of Con gress to provide for a diplomatic representa tive at Athens, the legation in Greece, has been withdrawn. There is now no channel of diplomatic communication between the two countries, and the expediency of provid ing for one in some form is submitted to Con gress, llelations with Austria, Itussia, Italy. Port ugal, Turkey and lielgium continuo amicable, and marked by no incident of especial im portance. A change of the personal head of tho government of Egypt has taken place. No cliauge, however, has occurred in the re lations between Egypt and the United States. The action of the Egyptian Government iu presenting to tho city of New York one of the ancient obelisks which possess such his torical interest is highly appreciated as a generous mark of international regard. If prosperity should attend the enterprise of its transportation across the Atlantic, its erec tion in a conspicuous position in tho chief commercial city of the nation will be soon ac complished. The treaty recently made between Japan and the United States, in regard to the revis ion of former treaties, it is now believed will be followed by similar action on the part of other treaty powers. The attention of Con press is aguin invited to the subject of the in demnity funds received some years since from Japan and China, which, with their accumu lated interest, now amount to considerable sums, If any part of these funds is justly due to American citizens they should receive it promptly, and whatever may have been re ceived by this Government in excess of strict ly just demands should, in some form, be re turned to the nations to whom it equitably belongs. Tho Government of China has sig nified its willingness to consider the question of the emigration of its subjects to tho United States with a dispassionate fairness, and to co-operate in such measures as may tend to prevent injurious consequences to the Uni ted States. The negotiations are still pro ceeding and will be pressed with diligence. A question having arisen between China and Japan about the Loochoo Islands, the United States Government has taken measures to in form those powers of its readiness to extend its ennrt nffinAR for thn tnaintinAn-A nf nAAi.n I if they shall mutually deem it desirable and find it practicable to avail themselves of the j proffer. STOITINCl THE J10RDEII llilllS. It is a gratification to be able to announco that, through tho judicious and energetic ac tion of tho military commanders of the two nations on each side of the ltio Grande, un- , eler tho instructions of their respective Gov- I cruments, raids and depredations have greatly decreased, and iu the localities where former merly most destructive, have now almost wholly ceased. In view of this result. I en- 1 tertaln a confident expectation that the con tinuance of the prevalence of quiet on tho border will soon becotuo so assured as to jus tify u modification of tho present orders to our military commanders, as to crossiug tho border, without encouraging such disturb ances as would endanger tho peace of the two countries The third installment of tho award against Mexico under the Claims Com mission of July 4, 18C8, was duly paid and has been put iu course of distribution in pur suance of the act of Congress providing for tho same. This satisfactory situation bo tweeu tho two countries leads me to anticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexico, and an increased contribution of capital and in dustry by our people to the development of tho great resources of that country. I earn estly commend to the wisdom of Congress tho provision of suitable legislation looking to this result. Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia Is again fully restored by the arrival of a Minis ter from that country to tho United States. This is especially fortunate, iu view of tho fact that the question of an iuteroceauic ca nal has recently assumed a new and import ant aspect and is now under discussion with the Central American countries, through whose territory the canal by the Nicaraugua route would have to pass. It is trusted that enlightened statesmanship on their part will see that the early prosecution of such a work will largely inure to the benefit, not only of their own citizens aud those of the United States, but of the commerce of the civilized world. It is not doubted that, should the work be undertaken under the protective au spices of the United States, and upon satis factory concessions for the right of way and its security by the Central American Govern ments, the capital for its completion would readily be furnished from this country and Europe, which might, failing such guaran tees, prove inaccessible. Diplomatic relations with Chili have also been strengthened by the rece ption of a Min ister from that country. The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chili still continues. The United States have not deemed it proper to interpose iu the luptter further than to con vey to all the Governments concerned tho as. surance that the friendly offices of the Gov ernment of the United States for the restora tion of peace upon an honorable basis will be extended, in case the belligerents shall exhib it a readiuesK to accept them. Cordial rela tions continue with Brazil and the Argentine Republic, and trade with those countries is improving. A provision for regular and more frequent mail communication in our own ships, between the ports of this country aud the nations of So'-'th America, seems to me to deserve the attention of Congress as an essential pn curtor of an enlargement of our commerce with them and an extension of our carrying trade. A recent revolution in Ven ezuela has been followed by the establish ment of a p-ovisional government. This government has not yet been formally recog nized, and it is deemed desirable to await the proposed action of the pe ople which is ex pected to give it the sanction of constitution al forms. A naval vessel has been sent to the Saiuoaii Islands, to lnaku surveys and take possession of the privileges ceded to the United State a by Samoa, in the harbor of Pago-Pago. A coaling station is to Iw estab hshed there, which will be convenient aud useful to United States vessels. The subject of opening diplomatic relations with ltoumania and Servia, now become in dependent sovereignties, is at present under consideration, and is the subject of diplo matic correspondence. There is a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all European and American countries, aud it is believed that, with judicious action iu regard to its development, it can aud will be still more enhanced, and that American products aud manufactures will find new and expanding markets. The reports of iiiuln. matic aud consular officers upon this subject, under tne system now adopted, havo resulted iD obtaining much valuable information which has been and w ill continue to be laid before Congress and tho public from time to time. THE CONDITION OF AEASEA. The third article of the treaty with Russia of March .".(). 1807, by which Alaska was ced od to the United States, provides that the inhabitants of the ceded territory, with the exception of the uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to tho enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of tho United States, and shall be maintained and protected in tho free enjoyment of their liberty of property and religion. The uncivilized tribes are Fubject to euch lnws and regulations as tho United States may from time to time adopt in regard to the aboriginal tribes of that country. Itoth the obligations of this treaty and the necessi ties of the people require that some organ ized form of gov ernment over the Territory of Alaska be adopted. There appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged with common law offenses, such as assault, rob bery aud murder, and no magistrate author ized to issue or execute process in such cases Serious difficulties have already arisen from offenses of this cLaracter, not only among the oriiriual inhabitants, but among citizens of the United States and other countries who have engaged in mining, fishing aud other operations within the Territory'. A bill au thorizing the appointment of Justices of the Peace aud constables and the arrest and de tention of persons churged with criminal of fenses, and providing for an appeal to United States courts in the District of Oregon, in suitable cases, will, at a proper time, be sub mitted to Congress. THE l'CKLIC FINANCES. Tho attention of Congress is called to the annual report of the Secretary of tho Treas ury on the condition of the public finances. Tho ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal yeur ended Juno 30, 16711, were 4273,827,181.40. The ordinary expenditures for the same period were 42l!(l,!471Os3..'pi3, leaving u burplus revenue for the year of 40, 870,300.113. The receipts for the present fis cal year, ending June 30, 180, actual and t-s-timated, are as follows . Actual receipts for tho first quarter commencing July 1, 1871). 4711,843,003.01 ; estimated receipts for the remaining three-quarters of the year, 420S, 1.V1, 330.31) ; total receipts for the current fis cal yeur, actual and estimated, 4268,000,000, The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows ' l'or the quarter commencing July 1, 187'J, actual ex penditures, 41)1,(183,38,". 10 : and for the re maining three-quarters of the year, the ex penditures are estimated at 4l72.31(i,(il4.',i(l, making the total expenditures 4201, 000,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for the year ending June 30, 1880, of 424,000,. 000. The total receipts during tho next fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, estimated accord ing to existing laws, will bo 42nS,"000,ooo, aud tho estimated ordinary expenditures for tho same period will be 4-'78,0'.i7,3(;4.3!i, leav ing a surplus of 4!i,!K)2,(;3,".(;i for that year. The large amount expended for arrears of pensions during the lust and the present fis cal year, amounting to 421,747,2111.(10, has prevented the application of the full amount required by law to the sinking fund for tho current year, but these arrears having been substantially paid, it is believed that tho sink, iug fund can hereafter bo maintained without any change of existing law. Till, 

ARMT ASI) NAVT. The Secretary of War reports that the War Department estimates for the fiscal year end ing June 30, 1881, are 410,380 428.03, the samo being for a less sum of money than any annual estimate rendered to Congress from that department during a period of at least 12 years. lie concurs with tho General of the Army iu recommending such legislation as will authorize the enlistment of the full num ber of 24,000 men for the line of tho Army, exclusive of the 3,100 men required for de tached duty, and therefore not available for service iu the field. He also recommends that Congress be asked to provide by law for the disposition of a large number of abandon ed military posts and reservations, which, though very valuable iu themselves, have been rendered useless for military purposes by the advauco of civilization aud settlement, lie unites with the Quartermaster-General in recommending that an appropriation be mado for tho construction of a cheap and perfectly fire-proof building for the safe storage of a vast amount of money, accounts, vouchers, claims, and other valuable records, now in the Quartermaster-General's office and expos eel to great risk of total destruction by fire. Ho also recommends, in conformity with tho views of the Judge Advocale.Geueral, some declaratory legislation iu refcrenco to the mil itary Statuto of Limitations, as applied to tho crime of desertion. In these several recom mendations I concur. The Secretary of War further reports that the work for the improve ment of tho South Pass of tho Mississippi lliver, under contract with Mr. James It. Ends, made in pursuance of an act of Con gress has been prosecuted during the past year, with a greater measure of success ill tho attainment of lesults than during any pre, vious year. The chauuel through tho South Puss which, at tho beginning of June, 1875, had a depth of only 7J feel of water, had, ou the 8th of July, 18711, u minimum depth of 21! feet, having a width of not less than 2(H) feet and a central depth of 30 feet. Pay ments have been made in accordance with the btatute as the work progressed, amount ing iu the aggregate to 41, 2."i(),00O, and fur ther p.iymeutB will become due, as provided by the statute, ju the event of success iu maintaining the channel now secured. Tho reports of the General of the Army aud of his subordinates present u full and detailed account of the military operations for the re pression of hostilities nmong the Indians of tho Uto and Apache tribes, and praise is just ly awarded to tho officers aud troops engaged, for promptness, skill and courage displayed. The past year has been one of almost unbrok en peace nud quiet un tho Mexican frontier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts of this Government and of Mexico to main tain order in that region will prove perma nently successful. This department was en abled during the past year, to Cud temporary though crowded accommodations and n sate depository for a portion of its records iu the completed cast wing of the buildiug designed for the State, War, and Navy Dejuirtmel.tn. The construction of the north wing of the buildiug, a part of the structure intended for the use of the War Department, U being car ried forward with all possible dispatch, and the work should receive from Congress such liberal appropriations us will secure itsspeedy completion. Tho report of the Scrtary of the Navy shows continued improvement iu that brunch of the service during the List fiscal year. Ex tensive repairs have been made upon vessels aud two new ships have been completed uud m ide ready for sea. The total expenditure of the year ended June 30, 1871I, including specifU appropriations not ostimated for by thi department, were 413,.".V.,710.O'.i. The expense chargeable to the year, after deiltict iug the amount of these specific appropria tions, were 413,313,317. 711, but this is sub ject toa reduction of 4283,72.".!'.', that amount having hicn drawn upon warrants, but not paid out during the year. Tho amount of ap propriations applicable to th last Usui y ear was 4 14,.Vls,illi. Thire was, thirtfon, u balance of 4l, 1 7l',O.M.37 remutuiug unex pended and to the credit of th.i department ou Juno 30. 18711. Tho estimates for the lis cul year ending June 30, l.81, are 4l4,Hi!l, 147.1i.". which exceeds the appropriations for tho lire-sent fiscal year 43(il,Bt)7.28. The rea son for this increase is explaiueel in the Sec retary's report. The appropriations available far tin present fiscal year are 41 1. '02. 2.'i0 07, whuh will, in the opinion of the Secretary , unswcrulltln ordinary demand of the ser vice. The amount draw n from th' Treasury from July 1 to Nov. 1, lh7'J, was".,77o, !(" 1.', of which il. ('.:,, 110.3:1 has been refund ed, leaving us the expenditure for that period 41.071. Oi;3.7:i If the expenditure of tb' re matuiug two-thirds of the year do not exeetd the proportion for these, four mouths, there will remain uucxpemh d ut lh end uf the year 4177. 3.Vi 3o of th eumut appropnutious Tht report of the Seeietary shows tho gratifying fact that among all the disbursing officers of the ay corps of the Navy there is not one who is a defaulter to the extent of a single dollar. I unite with hint in recommending the removal of the observatory to u more healthful location. That institution reflects credit upon the na tion, and has obtained the approbation of scientific men in nil parts of the world Its removal from iu present locality would not only be conducive to the health of its officers aud Professors, but would greatly increase its usefulness. Tho appropriation for judicial expenses, i-i.;..i, i. .. i i -a .... i, partmeat of Justice in gross, was subdivided at the last session of Congress, and no ap propriation whatever vow mudo for the pay ment of the fees of Marshals and their depu ties, either iu the service of process or for the discharge of other duties, and since June 30 thebe officers have continued the perform ance of their duties without compensation from the Government, taking upon them selves the necessary iucideutul outlays u- well as rendering their own service!,, in only a few unavoidable instances has the proper ex ecution of the process of the United Suites failed by reason of the absence of the requi site appropriation. This course of official conduct ou the part of these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the Attorney-General, who informed them, how ever, that they would necessarily huve to re ly for their compensation upou the prospect of future legislation by Congress. I there fore especially recommend that immediate appropriation be made by Congress for this purpose. Tne uct making the principal up propriation for the Department of Justice at previous sussious has uuiformly contaiueel the following clause, "Aud for defraying the ex penses which may be incurred in'the enforce ment of the uct approved Feb 2 1870, til titled An uct to amend an uct upprov e-d May 3o, l87o. entitled An act to enforce the right of citizens of the United States to vote iu the several States of the United States, uud for other purposes, or any ucts amendatory there of, or supplementary thereto." No appropri ation was madj for this purpose for the cur rent j ear. As no general election of members of Congress occurred, the omission was a mat ter of little practical importance. Such elec tion w ill, however, take place during the eu Buiug year, aud the appropriation mode for tho pay of Marshals and Deputies should be sufficient to embrace compensation for the services they may be required to perform at such election. 

OTHER BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT. The business of the Supremo Court is at present largely in arrears. Itiauuot be ex pected that more cuuses can bu decided than are now disposed of iu its uuuual session, or that by any assiduity the distinguished mag istrates who compose the court can accom plish more than is now done. In the courts of many of the circuits, also, the business has increased to such an extent that the delay of justice- will cull the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed that all is done iu each circuit which can fairly be expected from its judicial force. The evils arising from delay are less heavily felt by the Unite d States than by private suitors, us its cuuses are udvanced by tho courts when it is seeu that they involve tho discussion of questions of a public character. The remedy suggested by tho Attorney-General is the ap pointment of additional Circuit Judges, and the creation of an intermediate Court of Er rors and Appeals, which shall relieve the Su preme Court of a large part of its jurisdic tion, while a larger force is also obtained for the performance of circuit duties. I com mend this suggestion to the consideration of Congress. It would seem to afford a com plete remedy, and would involve, if ten addi tional Circuit -Judges are appointed, an ex penditure, at the present rate of salaries, of not more than 400,000 a year, which would certainly be small in comparison with the ob jects to be attained. The report of tho Postmaster-General bears testimony to tho general revival of business throughout the country. The receipts of the Post Olfico Department for the year ending June 30, 1871), were 430,011,1162 bli, being 4704,4(i,'i '.II more than the revenues of the preceding year. Tho amount realized from the sale of postage stamps, stamped envel opes, aud pobtal cards was 4704, Ida, t)l more than iu tho preceding year, aud 42,387, ".V.I 23 more than iu 1877. Tho expenditures of the department were 33,44!t,8!Ui 4.1, of which tho sum of 4:170,401 03 was paid on liabili ties incurred in the preceding year. Tho ex penditures duriug tho year, were 4601,2011 77 less than in the preceding year. This reduc tion is to be attributed mainly to the opera tion of the law passed Juue 17, 1878, chang ing the compensation of postmasters from u commission ou the value of stamps sold, to a commission ou stamps canceled. Tho amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to the revenues of the depart ment, was 43,031,454 14, being 2,27(1,107 bli less than in tho preceding yeur. The expen ditures for the fiscal year ending Juno 30, 1881, are estimated at 4311,020,1)00, and the receipts from all sources at 432,210,000, leav ing a deficiency to bo appropriated for out of the Treasury of $7,710,000. The relations of the department with railroad companies havo been harmonized, notwithstanding tho general reduction by Congress of their com pensation, by tho appropriation for special facilities. Tho railway post office lines havo boon greatly extended, especially iu tho Southern States, The interests of the rail way mail service and of the public would bo greatly promoted nud the expenditures could be luoro readily controlled, by the classifica tion of of tho employes of the railway mail servico as recommended by the l'ostmaster Gcneral. the appropriation for salaries, with respect to which the maximum limit is al ready fixed by law, to be mado iu gross. Tho Postmaster-General recommends nu amend ment of the law regulating tho increase of compensation for increased bcrvice nud in creased speed iu star routes, so as to enable hiui to advertise for proposals for such In creased service uud speed. Ho also suggests the udvuutugeH to accrue to the commerce of the country from the enactment of n general law, authorizing contracts with American built bteuuiers, currying thi American flag, tor transporting the mails between ports of the United States aud ports of the West In dies aud South America, at a fixed maximum price per mile . the amount to be expended to be regulated by annual appropriations, in like manner with the amount paid for the domestic star service. Tho arrangement made by the l'ostmaster-Geueral and the Sec retary of the Treasury for tho collection of duty upou books received in tho mail from foreign countries has proved so satisfactory in its practical operation that the recommen dation is now mad that Congress shall ex tend the provisions of the act of March 3, 1871), uuder which this nrraugement was made, so us to apply to all other dutiable ar ticles received iu the mails from foreigu countries. THE 

IVDIAN WARDS. The rejiortB of the Secretary of the Interi or and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, setting forth tho present stale of our relations with the Indian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to udvauee their civilization uud prosperity, and the progress ulrcady uchieved by them, will he found of more thuii ordinary int. rest The general conduct of our lucii'.iti population has been so satisfac tory that the occurrence of two disturbances, which resulted in bloodshed and destruction of property, is all the more to be lamented. The history of the outbreak on the White lliver Ut' reservation, iu Western Colorado, has become so familiar by elaborate reports in the public press that its remarkable inci dents need not be stated here in detail. It is expected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to such arrangements as will pre' veut furthc r hostile contact between the In dians and the border settlements iu Western Colorado. The other disturbance occurred at th Mescalero agency, iu New Mexico, where Victoria, the hind of u small band of marauders, after committing many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military force, made his way across the Mexican border, and is now ou loreigu sou. While these occurrences, in which n com paratively small number of Indians were en gaged, are most deplorable, it vust majority of our Indian population have fully justified the cxpe-ctations of those who believed that, by humane and peaceful influences, the In dian can be IkI to abandon the habits of sav age life and to develop u cajiucity for useful uud civilized occupations. What they have already accomplished in the pursuit of agri cultural and mechanical vvork, the remarka bl. success which has attended thi experi ment of employing as freighters n elast of Indians hitherto counted among the wildest aud most intractable, and the general aud ur gent desire expressed by them for the educa tion of their children, may be taken us suffi cient proof that they will found capable of accomplishing much more if they continue to be wisely and fairly guided. Tne Indian pol icy sketched in the report of the Secretary of the Interior, the object of which is to make liberal provision for the education of Indian youth, to settle the Indians ujion farm lots iu severaltj , to give them title in fee to their farms, lualienabh for a certain number of years, and when their wants are thus provid ed for, to disfiose by sale of the lauds on their reservations not occupied and used by them, u fund to bo formed out of the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians, which will grad ually relieve the Government of the expen ses now provided for. bv, annua! niii.i-nitin-tions, must comuieud itself as just aud bene ficial to the Iudians, and us also calculated to remove those obstructions which thu cxist enci of large restrictions presents to the set tlement mid development of the country I therefore earnestly recommend tho enactment of a law enabling the Government to give In dians u titb m fet , inalienable for 2."i years, to the farm lauds assigned to them by allot ment. I also repeat the recommendation made in my first annual message that a Law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proof of having by their own la bor supported their families for a number of yeurs, and who are willing to detach them selves from their tribal relations, to the ben efit of th Homestead act, aud to grunt them patents containing the same provision of in alienability for u certain period. The exper iment of sending a number of Indian chil dren of both sexes to the Hampton Normal aud Agricultural Institute in Virginia to re ceive on elementary English education and practical instruction in farming and other useful industries, has led to results so prom isiug that it was thought expedient to turn over the cavalry burracks at Carlisle, m Penn sylvania, to the Interior Department, for the establishment of an Indian school on u larger scale. This school has now l."8 pupils, se lected from various tribes, and is in full op eration. Arrangements are also made for the education of a number of Indian boys and girls, belonging to tribes on the Pacific slope, in a similar manner, at Forest Grove, in Ore gon These institutions will commend them selves to the liberality of Congress aud to the philanthropic luuuihceuco of the American people. Last spring, information was received of the organization of an extensive movement iu the Western States, the object of which was the occupation, by unauthorized persons, of certain lauds in the Indian Territory, ced od by tho Cheroke-es to the Government for the purpose of settlement by other Indian tribes On the 2Hth of April, I issued a proc lamation w arniug all persons against partici pation in such an attempt, and, by the co operation of a military force, the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect the rights of the Indian inhabitants of that Territory to the full extent of tht Ex ecutive power . but it would be unwise to ig nore the fact that a Territory so large and so fertile, with n population so sparse and so great a wealth of unused resources, will be found more exposed to the repetition of such attempts as happened this year when tho sur rounding States are more densely settled aud tho westward movement of our population looks still more eagerly for fresh lands to oc cupy. Under such circumstances, the diffi culty of maintaining tho Indian Territory in its present state will greatly increase, aud the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to prepare for such a contingency I therefore fully approve of tho advice given to them by the Secretary of the Interior, ou a recent oc casion, to divide among themselves in sever alty as large a quantity of their lands as they can cultivate, to acquire individual titles iu fee, instead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider in what manner the balance of their lauds may be disposed of by the Government for their benefit. Ity adoptiug such a policy they would more cer tainly secure for themselves the value of their possessions, and at the same time promoto their progress in civilization and prosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate the pres ent state of things in tho Territory. The question whether a chougo in tho control of tho Indian servico should be made was, in the Torty-fifth Congress, referred to a joint com. mittee of both houses for inquiry and report, In my last annual message, I expressed the hope that the decision of that question then in prospect, "would arrest further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produco a disturbing effect upon the service, as well as the Indians themselves." Since then, the committee having reported, tho question has been decided in the negative by a vote iu the House of ltepresentatives for the reasons here stated, and in view of the fact that further uncertainty on this point will bo calculated to obstruct other much, uecdod legislation, to weaken the discipline of tho service, and to unsettle salutary meas. urea now in progress for the government and improvement of the Iudians, I respectfully recommend that the decision arrived at by Congress at its last session be permitted to staud, THE VC'llLIC 

LANDS. Efforts mado by tho Department of tho In terior to arrest the depredations on tho tim ber lauds of the United States have been con tinued, and have met with considerable sue cess. A largo number of cases of trespass havo been prosecuted in the courts of tho United States. Others have been settled, tho j trespassers offering to make payment to the Government for tho value of the timber taken by them. Tho proceeds of these prosecu- tious and settlements, turned Into the Trens ; ury, far exceed in amount the sums appropri l ated by Congress for this purpose. A nioro . important result, however, consists in tho lad tnal tne destruction of our public forests by depredation, although such cases still oc cur, has been greatly reduced iu extent, and it is probablo that if tho present policy is vig orously pursued and sufficient provision to that cud is made by Congress, such trespass es, nt least those ou n large scale, can be en tirely suppressed, except in the Territories where timber for the daily requirements of tho populations caunot, under the present state of tho law, bo otherwise obtained. I thcroforo earnestly invite the attention of Congress to the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that ft law bo enacted enabling tho Government to sell tim ber from the public lands, without conveying tho fee, where such lands are principally val uable for tho timber thereon, such sales to bo so regulated as to conform to domestic wants uud business requirements, while nt the sumo time guarding against a sweeping destruction of the forests. Tho enactment of such a law appcras to become a more pressing necessity every day. DEPARTMENT OF AOEICl'LTURE. My recommendations in former messages are renewed, in favor of enlarging the facili ties of the Department of Agriculture. Ag riculture as the leading interest and the per manent industry of our people. It is to the abundance of agricultural production, as com pared with our home consumption, aud the largely-increased aud highly-profitable mar ket abroad w hich w e hav e enjoyed in recent years, that we are mainly indebted for our firesent prosperity as a people. We must ook for its continued maintenance to the same substantial resource There is no branch of industry in which labor, directed by scien tific knowledge, yields such increased produc tion in comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the public service to which the encouragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropriately extended The omis sion to render such airt is not a w i economy, but, on the coutrury, undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums anuuully that might be saved through well-directed efforts by the Government to promote this vital interest. The results already accomplished with the very limitcel meuns heretofore placed at the command of the Department of Agriculture is an earnest of what may be expected, with increased appropriations lor the several pur poses indicated in the refmrt of the Commis sioner, with a view to placing the deiiartutent upon a footing which will enable it to prose cute more effectively the objects for which it is established. Appropriations are neidcd for a mon complete laboratory, for the es tablishment of a veterinary division and a division of forestry, uud for an increase of force. The requirements for these and other purposes indicated in tho report of the Com missioner, under the head of the immediate necessities of the department, will not in volve any exjienditure of money that the country ennuot with propriety now undertake in the interests of agriculture. UCREAt OF EDUCATION It is gratifying to leuru from the llureau of Education the extent to which educational privileges throughout the United States have been advanced during the year. No more fundamental responsibility rests ujkiu Con gress than that of devising appropriate meas ures of financial aid to education, supplemen tal to locul action in the States and 'territor ies and District of Columbia. The wise fore thought of the founders of our Government has not only furnished the basis for the sup port of the common school system of the newer Slates, but laid the foundations for the maintenance of their universities aud colleges of agriculture uud the mechanic arts. Meas ures in accordance with this traditional Ttoli- cy, for the further benefit of all these inter ests, nud the extension of the same advan tages to every jiortiou of the country, it is hoped will receive your favorable considera tion. To preserve and pertK-tuute the national lit erature should be umong the foremost cares of the National Irftcitlatiirc. The library until, cred at tbi tupttol still remains uuprovidud with any suitable accommodations for its rap idly increasing stores The magnitude and iuijortaucc of the collection, increased as it is by the deposits made under the law of copy right, by domestic and foreigu exchanges, and by tho scientific Library of the Smithsonian Institution, call for building accommodations whit h shall be nt once equal and fire-proof The location of such a public building, which should provide for the pressing necessities of the present, aud for the vast increase of the nation's books in the future, is a matter which a HresseM itself to the discretion of Congress. It is earnestly recommended as u measure which should unite all suffrages, and which 6hould no longer be delayed. TUE WAKmsaTON MONUMENT. The joint commission created by the act of Congress of August 2, 1870. for the purpose of hupcrvising and directing the completion of the Washington national monument, of which commission the President is n member, hus given careful attention to this subject, and already tbf stringthcning of the founda tion has so far progressed as to insure the en tire success of this part of the work. A mas. sive layer of masonry has been introduced be low the original foundation, widening the base, increasing the stability of the structure, aud rendering it jvossible to carry the shaft to completion. It is earnestly recommended that such further appropriations be mada for the coutinued prosecution of the work as may be necessary for the completion of this na tional monument at an early day. THE DISTRICT 01 COLt'MUlA. Iu former messages, impressed with the importance of the subject, I have taken occa sion to comuieud to Congress the adoption of a generous jiohcy towards the District of Co lumbia. Thercjiortof theCommissiouersof the District, hei ew ith trausmitted, contains sugges tions nud recommendations, to all of which I earuestlyinvite your careful attention. 1 ask your early aud favorable consideration of the views which they express us the urgent need of legislation for tho reclamation of the marshes of the Potomac aud its Eastern brunch, within the liuiitsof the city, and for the repair of the btreets of the Capital,, heretofore laid with wooden blocks, and now by decay rendered almost impassable, uud u source of imminent danger to the health of its citizens. The means at the disposal of the commissioners are wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of these important works and should be supplemented by timely appropriations from the federal treasury. The filling of the flats iu front of the city will add to the adjacent lands and parks now owned by the United States, a large and valuable domain, sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its entire cost, uud will also, us an iucideutul result, becure the per manent improvement of tho river for the pur poses of navigation. The constitution hariug invested Congress with supremo and exclusive jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, its citizens must of necessity look to Congress alone for all need ful legislation affecting their interests ; and as the territory of this district is the common property of tho people of the United States, who, equally with its resident citizens, are in. terested in tho prosperity of their Capital, I cannot doubt that you will be amply sustain ed by the general voico of the country in any measures you may adopt for this purpose. I also invite tho favorable consideration of Congress to the wants of the public schools of this district, as exhibited in the report of tho commissioners. While tho number of pupils is rapidly increasing, no adequate provision exists for a corresponding increase of school accommodation, and the commissioners nro without the means to meet this urgent need. A number of the buildings now usod for school purposes are rented, and are, in impor. tant particulars, unsuited for the purpose. The cause of popular education in the Dis trict of Columbia is surely entitled to tho same consideration at the hands of the na. tional government as iu the several States and Territories, to which munificent grants of the public lauds have been made for the endowment of schools aud universities. ltumEEFonn II, Haves.

He made a speech from the scaffold, protesting his innocence, aud accusing one Mrs. Perrin, a disreputable character, of the crime. He was sure, ns murderers mostly are, now-a-days, that he was going straight to Heaven. Mngoon was a man of peculiarly low- and brutal character, and it is said that not n member of his family, wife or children, visited him while he lay in prison. The message of President Hayes, sent to the 4i)th Congress at the beginning of its first regular session last Monday, is of rather un usual length, but we nevertheless present it to our renders in full The message com mands universal praise as n plain, sensible, straightforward paper, moderate in tone, and full of wise suggestions. The Boston Herald just hits the popular estimate of the docu. ment when it says "Its tone is eminently quiet, and the suggestions emliodied in it are. in all resjiects. suited to a time like the pres ent, when the business men all over the coun try are of the opinion that their interests will be advanced better by their own unaided ef forts than by experimental leg'slation on the' part of the national government. This beems to be the spirit in which the message is writ ten, and it is no little to the credit of Presi dent Hayes that ho has so closely gauged jKjpulur feeling in this respect. Coming, as it does, immediately after a hot political cam paign, in which stalwartism and sectionalism find that our "Chief magistrate has had the good sense to ignore these matters, except by way of passing comment, which indicates his Ksition in a manner in no way calculated to arouse partisan hostility."
