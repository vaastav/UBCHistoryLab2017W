A murder in Tucson. NoQALEI, A. X. ( December B.—One of the most cold-blooded attempts at mur der, ever committed in thia place, oc curred yesterday about 4 o'clock at tbe United States Custom House. Denny M. Kalher, agent for N. M. & A. R. R., went to tbe Custom House with the pur pose of paying duties on some oranges. After a few remarks with the deputy collector, Wilson B. E. Hamblcton, a mounted luapector of Customs rose from his chair and remarked: "Kalher, you havo been making nasty remarks about me." "Hambleton, if 1 have said any thing about you that is not so, 1 will take it back and sincerely beg your pardon, but if what I have suid is so, I relract nothing, and everything goes." Upon this Hambleton struck Kalhar knockiug him backward. As Kahlar was recovering from the blow, Hambleton stepped back aud tired, the ball entering Kalhar between the sixth and seventh rib* on tbe left side, pass ing through the lower part of the left lung, made its exit about au inch to the left of the spinal columu, carrying with it portions of the spinal column. A large crowd soon gathered and the in jured man was removed to his room in the depot. The wound is probably fatal. Hambleton was immediately ar rested and heavily ironed and a guard of live men was placed over him. Kuots of men gathered around the streets ad vocating lynching Hambleton in caae of Kahlar's death. Rumors of a probable attempt at lynching reaching the officers' ears they took the prisoner by a private conveyance to Tucson last night. A Broker's Trouble*.

FLORENCES. "Denihey and Non"mt the <;rand Opera Iloase. Mr. W. J. Florence Appeared at the Grand Opera House last night as "Cap tain Cuttle" in "Dombev aud Son," Ho wore the very make-up' in nil respects iuventod by that prinqc of eld time comedians, W. E. Burtop, It is useless to speak of its artietirj excellence to those who saw it, and equally useless to speak of it to thoße who hover saw it. The same may be said in due measure of the dressing of the pifcee throughoti', us also of the setting. TJbe dream scene of the rescue at sea was very tine. But the scene shifters should draw up the net v.oik curtain at the cud of the dream. The elegant audience present were de lighted with the rendition of the inter esting drama. Florence tvas at his best, and his support is really, in the main, very good. Tbe Mrs. Dombey of Miss Florence Noble was a most acceptable reudition of tbe role. The "Nipper" of Miss Hattie Russell, was alsu particu larity good. Mrs. Florence's dresses are so remark able tbat a brief sketch of some of them foil IM S. A gown that was coveted and copied by the Queeu of Spain la of amber satin. The Marchioness tratu is seed through a dra pery of jetted lace as Is also the petticoat. Demi sleeves of jetted lace and pelerine of the same complete the costume. A gown of garnet satlu striped with garnet and white, with richly embroidered aide panels is pretty. The roses and leaves In the em broidery are full-sized au4 'twere easy to imagine them nature's own. The bali room costume worn iv "Our Governor" is just too sweet for anything. It is of ciel blue aud suushlne sat'ln, with ducheas traiu caught In miffs over tbe touruure and long pleated side panels over a white satin petticoat. Hut the daintiest of all, the oue dream of loveliness, is a costume of white French faille silk, haud-embroidered iv nature's owu exact tints Tne low corsage la sleeve less, and elaborately embroidered to match the skirt. The tournure and drapery are the most elegant I have ever seen, aud its elegance la heightened by the graceful car riage of the wearer. In none of thesedresses I- there a taint of staginess. Neither does it appear In a single costume belonging to the ladlea of tin company. There is not a thread of tinsel, a wax bead nor a glass dia mond. The toilets might be worn at the most elegant court reception, such are their elegance of make up, richness of fabric aud elaboration. This evening T om Taylor's great moral drama and life in London! in live acts, eutitled "The Ticket of Leave Man," will be presented, with Mk Florence in bis great ami original character of Bob Briefly, a Lancashire lad- This par; has been played by Mr. Florence over 2 000 times in the United States and Canada to overflowing houses.

Chief of Police Davis Leaves Hie Position at a moment's Notice. Charges were brought once more yes terday by Offictr Focck against Chief of Police Davis, whom he accuses of hav ing attempted to bribe him on four dif ferent occasions with money considera tions, in order to prevent him from bringing tbe charges which were inves tigated by a special committee about one month ago, when the Chief was exoner ated. The President of the Council ap pointed a committee of three to investi gate these charges. Very soon afterwards Officer Weed brought in v communication, written by himself and signed by the Chief, of the following tenor: To the Hon. City Council: Gentlemen:—l have the honor Io tender my resignation as Chief of Police and ask your immediate acceptance of the same. My reasons are that I am unjustly ac cused or blamed for an act of mine which was done without any wilful or malicious motive, and solely to benefit another person; but circumstances are such that I am without witnesses to demonstrate the truth of my assertion, and I therefore prefer to resign ar, once, though perfectly conscious in my own mind, that I am innocent of any wrong, illegal or improper act, were the whole facts known. Very respectfully, Your ob'dt servant, J. W. Davis. The resignation was almost immdi ately accepted, but several members afterwards moved to reconsider the vote, accepting it, on the ground that in the face of the charges brought against the Chief, it would be more proper to investigate them and act upon the re. suit, which would be readied by the special Committee. Mr. Frankenfie'd thought that an investigation would amount to nothing, as the Council has the power only to dismiss the Chief in the event of his guilt being proved. The motion to reconsider was lost by six to six. there being no majority, Captain Ketler was suggested as acting Chief-of- Police, but Mr. Jones thought that be was too intimately connected with the charges as a witness to m ike it desirable that he should take charge. The Coun cil, however, decided otherwise, and Ketler was instructed to perform the duties of Chief -of - Police until the appointment of a new Chief at the next Council meeting. Board of Supervisors.

The hearts of the ladies engaged in this woman's work have been gladdened by donatious of lots of money by the hearty co-operation of hundreds, in the great work of car rying on our annual festivals, and now Mr. H. W. Mills has added another link to our long glistening chain of blessings. You are doubtless aware tbat our so ciety ia erecting our Woman's Home, commodious and complete in all of its departments, on Fourth, between Maiu and Los Angeles streets. A most happy thought suggested itself to Mr. Mills, w hioli he carried out by offering to furnish (more than com fortably) one of the sleeping rooms of this Home; and in additiou to this, to put into our treasurer's hands tbe sum of one hundred dollars to be used where most needed. Certainly this example of Mr. Mills is most worthy of imitation.
