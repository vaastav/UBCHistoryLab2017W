TAULBEE Tlie Congressman from our neighboring district over the way the Hon Preston Taulbee is charged at Washington with de cidedly improper conduct in con nection with a pretty young fe male in tlie Patent Office Depart ment Mr Taulbee secured her a clerkship last February and she was registered as from Kentucky but she claims to be from else where Taulbee spent the sum mer in Washington and bought a Itotise He and the pretty clerk were shadowed to an unfrequent ed nook in the upper story of the Patent Office and a sensation fol lowed Mr Taulbees first effort will be to make his wife believe that lie is a persecuted and black mailed man and then will come an angry constituency to know why he appointed a woman from another State when there are so many persons in Kentucky yea in hk own district who want of fice Those two elements appeas ed he will have the greater part of the victory won for the public will most likely treat him as were Beeoher Blaine and Cleveland DLACKBUEX OX TARIFF Concerning tariff legislation Senator Blackburn say 6 UI regard Randall as the pivot upon which the whole situation is swung and express great fears as to what he may do But Mr Randall is reading the hand writing on the wall and it is too plain for him to need an Inter preter like Belshazzer did I hope he is too sensible a man to stand in the way now If he does he must be regarded as a marplot as a man who stands in the way of righting the coun trys wrongs The situation is a graygjne Representative Stone from the First district says The House must without failure pas a bills Teduoing taxes this session or our aajoriV jtfU be reserved The country demands it My vate preference would be to make all the reduction from the rotten tariff list I would vote for the repeal of the tax on tobacco if that is sure to pass Our state is in favor of that Then I am lor taking the tariff from the prime necessaries of life We must show something tangible by next fall THE TWIN CITIES TIP Two cities equal iu magnitude to St Paul and Minneapolis do not often prow so olosn lnrpthpr A urmno n only twelve miles separates litem and tlie half way point is marked bv the State Fair grounds and bouses of vari ous kinds are springing up along tiie way between The Fair grounds are not erected on any diminutive scale They extend over a hundred acres and permanent buildings of wide dimensions dot the space in every direction Tlie Fair was in progress when I was there in September and I found horses and cattle from many different states The race track is not among the least of the attractions The art gallery contained some of tlie rarest paintings in the United States ranging in price from 5000 to 510000 and this too while tlie Minneapolis exposition was in progress with Us wonderfully fine collection of paintings Finer vegetables were probably never seen any where One pumpkin weighed 135 pounds I saw a man draw in three dozen ears of corn and he hadnt any muscular energy to spare Southern Minnesota produces excellent corn while in tlie northern part it does not grow at all but those two parts of the State are a long way removed from each other I remarked to the man with the big corn that a poor cow or horse that might chance to come along would have a picnic at his place if he would only leave the gate open Not much picnic wearily replied the man except around the edges corn stands so thick on tlie ground that a cow cant walk through it stranger All the North west had sent its choicest specimeus of produce The thrift and general pros perity of those live people were abund antly set forth The factories were well represented Drake Co of St Paul stone works who have their fac tor at Sioux Falls where they do all their tawing aud cutting by water power had on exhibition a section of auagatiued tree taken from Agate Park Arizona aud sawed at Sioux Falls It was twenty six inches in diamater aud near three feet long One piece was sawed off to form tlie top of a small table It was the finest specimen of agate I ever saw and as a matter of curiosity I asked the price Mr Drake replied that it was sold to a Masonic Lodge in Philadelphia for their altar top aud the price was twelve hundred dollars St Paul is a great aud growing city It is ierhaps most noted for its winter carnivals A gorgeous palace is con structed entirely of ice at an expense of thousands of dollars having towers and spires and domes and the weather being uniformly cold it stands until spring time People visit it by hun dreds aud at night it is brilliantly illumi nated witli electricity The ice palace carnival is to St Paul what Mardi Gras is to New OrIeau8and people from long distances visit it St Paul is the parent ot that colossal railroad system the St Paul Minneap olis aud Manitoba Railway that pene trates every portion of Minnesota aud the ramifications of which extend into Manitoba Assiuiboia Dakota and Montana The past summer eight hundred miles were added to the sys tem by construction I saw a business house in St Paul that filled my idea of perfection in tlie way of exhibiting goods It stood on a corner and the end aud entire side of the first story were plate glass 1 saw one iu Chicago like it But Minneapolis is a second Chicago It is a marvelous city and growing day by day Its buildiugs possess a noticeable magnitude It is clean and bright aud beautiful Proceeding from St Paul you are awe inspired by the gigantic stone viaduct of twenty four arches that conveys the train obliquely across aud up the river into that splen did structure known as the union depot You are overpowered by objects of interest as you glide over thai mar vel of engineering skill t lie viaduct There is St Antuonys Falls of which you have read in your school days above it a snow white suspension bridge and to the rigtil is the Pills bury A Millthe largest flouring mill in the world having a capacity of seven thousand barrels of flour a day con suming thirty five thousand bushels of wheat Near it are five saw mills that cost 50000 apiece and overlook ing them is the expansive and lower ing exposition building On the left are the famous Washburne mills aod under you is the raging Mississippi while all around is a great city From what bridge fave famous old Loudon can one see so much But the wonders do not cease upon leaving the train Walk up Nicolet street say at night aud you are struck with the display of gas Six squares area solid blaze of light The gas posts are only twelve feet apart and an arch reaches from one to another along tlie street every arch having five jets aud every post 4iiteen At the intersection of other streets there is a vast pyramid of jets and half way the squares are arches extending across Nicolet street each haviug eighty jets There are one thousand jets to the square for six squares or six thousand lets before you at one glance all in closed in globes of red white and blue street is broad and well paved and the houses are from three to seyeu and eight stories high I think the Lumber Exchange is teuand the West hotel would do credit to Chicago or New York Wheu the exposition is in progress or the State Fair or tlie Ice Palace is on at St Paul the gas lets of Nicolet street are turned on in all their magnificence aud the people come in their carriages and form a procession driving up one side of the street aud down the other They con tinue to drive for an hour or two with noted regularity By taking a position at any point along the line one can soon see the people of importance about the city It is the water power that has made Minneapolis St Anthonys Falls were not made in vain The water is diverted from the river iuto the numer ous aud gigantic mills and Minnesota and Dakota wheal pour Into them by the St P M M road in as great abundance as the water does by the Mississippi Barrel after barrel car after car aud train after train load of flour leaves the Flour City daily for all parts of the universe Among the countless attractions I taw Ju the Exposition was HarneUa painting of the old violin which Is val ued at 3300 A faithful copy of It hangs Iu the Madison Club aud is a present from Mr J K Hurd the pharmacist and druggist corner Fourth and Elm streets Cincinnati Liberatli and hb captlvatlug band from New York attracted multitudes to the Exposition It would require a large volume to describe the Expo alt ion and I could fill a eerlea of vol umes on the Minneapolis Milwaukee aud Chicago expositions aud the Min nesota Fair Among the residents of Minneapolis is Mr Tom Hawkins a nativeof Owen county Ky and who visited Rich mond last summer He is a horse dealer and has a large stable in a promi nent partfof the city Near Minneapolis is the widely known summer resort Lake Miune touka Tlie two largest hotels are the Hotel St Louis aud the Hotel La Fay ette the former of which was owned by Mrs Eglnton of Winchester Ky The lake is a beautiful body of water and has upon it two large steamers and numerous smaller craft Numbers ot persons have thought from several pieces similar to the above thatl was away from home at the time they were written in fact away up in the fir North west among the scenes about which I wrote but I must say for the information of those persons that I am not there noir nor was I when those articles were wrltteu I was there in September but I am at home now and if you doubt it call and I will show you the handsomest edi torial room in Kentucky and some rare specimens In geology and natural history
