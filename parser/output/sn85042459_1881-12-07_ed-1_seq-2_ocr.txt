The laying of telegraph wires underground is now compulsory in Germany, and tbeohange is hailed with great satisfaction by tbe peo ple. No good reason exists why ths reform should not be oarrled •nt In this country. The telegraph companies make a great deal of mosey, and the expense attending the change would be a mere baga telle to them. The Infinitely greater convenience of tbe new •ystem ie conceded on all hands. In the large cities of the United States wires are multiplying at such a rapid rate as to threaten confusion worse confounded. In Ban Francisco tbey are numerous and are often so interwoven tbat the insulators are sometimes cut through, with the result of setting Ire to the telephone boxes and In jury to the operators. The day is not far distant when tbe public will demand and the laws enforce the change. It must be admitted tbat, thus far, President Arthur has conduct ed himself with great skill and good Judgment. Yet the question constantly reours, how long can be keepltup? The stalwarts, with whioh wing of the party lie affili ates, are oortain to push tbelr de mauds upon their old comrade and he Is quite apt to yield to tljem. A test ease as to how far tbe Presi dent Intends to have a mind of bis own will be afforded by his treat ment ef Judge Robertson. If tbat gentleman continues as Col lector of the Port of New York during Arthui's term ble administration will be pitched In a conciliatory key, the Hon of atalwartism and tbe lamb of Half breedism lying down in peace to gether, at least as far as that re sult can be brought about by tbe President. There are already omi nous bints that Roberteon is about to resign tbe Colleotorshlp, which Is a euphemistic way of eaylng - that he steps down and out to avoid being kioked out. His displace ment will be the signal for an out burst of Half Breed Indignation which will probably last during tbe President's term and which may result in a serious split In the Republican party. Or late our most famous million aires are developing a disposition to patronise art aod enrich their houses with the works of men of genius. Vanderbilt and Leland Stanford, especially, ore eoiploy "fog the brushes of the best artists of France, and much of the best work of Bouguereau, Odinot and other famous living masters, is finding its way to this country, while tbe galleries of the world are being ransaoked for autlque works of art. There is one special ly commendable feature about tbis fervor for art, in addition to grati fying their owners, every fine pic ture or piece of statuary brought into the country is a permanent benefit, helping to form tbe taste of our people aud giving higher inspiration and nobler models to onr artists. Tbey often Und their way into public galleries as be quests, and where tbey are still kept In private bands a disposition Is growing upon the part of collec tors to lend their renowned works of art to assist charitable and re ligious objects. The late art loan exhibition In San Francisco dem onstrated tbe willingness of our wealthy meu to allow tbe public to enjoy their art treasures ss well as showed tbat very extensive and valuable collections already exist upon the Pacific Coast. . These have bees few incidents In public life bo flagrantly indecent aa the eoaree vehemence with which General Grant permits him ealf to assail Secretary Blame. The patience of tbe latter gentleman under these gross assaults is some thing te marvel at. Ordinarily he ia tbe most fiery of men, and his power of invective has been rarely equaled. Coneldering bow vulner able Grant Is most people ate sur prised tbat the Plumed Knight has not literally burnt him up as a scroll is consumed over a blaze. Above all men Blame is the most oompetent to do this, and bis failure to bit baok is one of the most mysterious things of enrrent politics. Grant, of late, has been aulte fastidious as to tbe Otaaraetar ef our public men, and his standard Is so high now that one wonders tbat It could ever have been low enough to Include snob men aa Laudaulet Williams, Belknap and a dozen others we could name. Grant made one mir aculous escape. Whan brave old Andrew Johnson, after a gallant struggle, got himself eleoted to the United States Ssnate, the whole couotry turned with expectancy to the scene that was certain to fol low. Nobody doubted that Johnson would prove a good sized thorn in tbe aide of tbe man wbo bad be trayed him, but death came to the resoue of the sull»n smoker of tbe White House. He Is making an equally happy esoape In Blame's unacceuntable silence. It is just possible that the Maine statesman considers it inconsistent with tbe dignity of tbe official position he holds to engage In violent contro versies, and that be is saving him self up till be becomes a private oitlzen, which will be lv a few days. If so, General Grant's purga torial experience is merely post poned, not remitted. The election of yesterday is a straw tbat shows whioh way tbe polltioal wind blows in this sec tion. The Democrats made no special efforts to win. On the con trary, we have never seen a time when so little of the "machine" was visible at tbe polls. The result Is largely traceable to a circum stance which ought not to pass un observed, viz., the action of oar fellow citizens of German birth, a large preponderance of whom have hitherto been Bspublican In poli tics. In local matters the Repub oans can no longer depend upon the allegiance of tbe Germans, wbo see with disgust adlsposition upon the part of tbe Republicans to re sort to Sunday and sumptuary laws. Thsy know that whenever this party gets tbe power they will exercise it in tbat direction, and however muoh a certain element efthe Republican party may de sir* to control their neighbors the Germans are determined not to aid in welding their own fetters. Tbis determination of tbeir* has reduced the Republican majority in Wis consin to next to nothing, it often Insures euoh strong Republican cities as Cincinnati and Chicago to tbe Democrats, and it will hereaf ter bave a marked influence In the politics of both I.om Angeles city ami county. Tbe existence of slavery had much to do with mak ing the Germuns Republicans. Tbat Issue having beeu disposed of lOBg ago, aud a strong imperialist tendency having been developed In the Republican party in the per sons of the advocates of a third term, the Germans are likely to vote hereafter according to their personal predilections. It would not surprise a closs observer If the Republican party were to Buffer heavily through the defection of this Important element of their strength both in the country at large, in California and in the county of Los Augeles. Self-preaer vatien is the first law of nature with our German fellow-citizens as with other people; and, as they are very mucb attached to th* tra ditional German ideas of a cheer ful and uuobetructed Suuda.v and free lager, tbey are apt to vote as tbey teal. While, of course, this whole matter admits of much dis cussion on both sides, the practical man takes oognizance of faots and acts aouerdingly.

The Quarterly Htvltw, a Mormon mag asl'.e, in Us last Issue, oalls for a dissolution of tbe partnership be tween Churob and State, and tbe formation of an anti-Tabernacle party. The President's message Inspires some hope among the Gentiles, though many fear it will all end in smoke as before. Tbe time was never riper for crushing out polygamy than now. 

EASTERN. The Creaideat'e ateaseae. Washington, Dec. 6.—On tiie opening of Congress tbe Presi. dent's message was read. Tbe message, after deploring tbe as sßßSlnatien of Garfield, congratu lates the country on its prosperous and peaceful condition. Diplo matic relations with various for eign powers are mentioned In de tail, and suggestions offered for the guidance of Congress In tak ing such action as will tend to pro mote tbe international interests and strengthen existing bonds of amity and good will. It deplores the lawlessness wbiob pre vails along tbe Mexioan bor der* and suggests Congress ional intervention to sup press tbe same. It congratulates tbe country on the peaceable rela tions between tbe United States and tbe Sooth American States, and suggests that tbe rights and interests of American Government be carefully guarded in tbe settle ment by arbitration of the disput ed question between Costa Rica and Columbia. It congratulates tbe Government on tbe fact tbat tbe resent treaty with China has been duly ratified on both sides, The friendly spirit evinced by the Chinese Government In conoediug modifications should secure a care ful regard for the interests and sus* ceptlbilities of that peoplo in tbe enactment laws regarding in,mi gration. While our relations with tbe Hawaiian kingdom are very friend ly, this government views with concern the efforts being made to replenish tbe rapidly diminishing population from outward souroes which threatens to Impair their native sovereignty aud independ ence. It commends efforts being made both by the American and Chinese governments to put a stop to tbe demoralizing and destruct ive opium traffic; also suggests some desirable changes in the pres ent system of consular jurisdiction between this government aud those of China and Japan. It re grets that commercial interests be tween tbe United States and Bra zil, from which great advantages are hoped, have suffered from the withdrawal of American lines of communication between Brazilian ports anil our own. It suggests tbat tbe diplomatic representa tives be restored, even on a re duced scale at Athens, Greece and Quito Equador. It suggests tbe propriety of Congress adopting a new code of ioternatiol rules for tbe prevention of collisions of ves sels on tbe high seas, and men tions ths purpose of tbo Emperor of Japan to establish a constitu tional government, aod parliamen tary Congress, as a. remarkable step toward a complete assimila tion with the Western system, and cannot fall to bring Japan into closer aud more beneliclul rela tionship with the United States. The President concurs in tbe rec ommendations of tbe Secretary of the Treasury tbat the provision for the coinage of a fixed amount of ■iiver for each year be repealed and hereafter only bo much be coined as shall be necessary to supply the demand; tbat the issue of gold certificates should not for the present be resumed, and that the National Bankß may properly be fotbiddeu by law to retire their currenoy, except upon reasonable notloe of their in tention to do so. The ordinary re sources of the government from all sources for the year ending June SOtb, 1681, are, customs, $19,816, --967,602; Internal revenue, $13,626, --438,661; sale of public lands, $222, 186,847; taxes ou circulation and of National Banus, $8,116,11872; repayment of interest by Pacific railroad companies, $810,833.80; sinking fund of Pacific railroad companies, $806,180.54; oustom fees, fines end penalties, $1,226, --614.86; fees consular, letters patent and lands, $2,244,984.99; total or dinary expenditures of tbe govern ment, $260,712,687.59; leaving a surplus revenue or $100,089,404.98. Tbe President concurs in tbe Sec retary's views iv recommending the abolition of all the internal revenue rates except on tobacco, and distilled liquors, and excepts special tax upon manufacturers and dealers iv these articles. He believes In the propriety and jus tics of repealing tbe law by which banks and bankers ure assessed on their oapltal and deposits. He commends a general revision of the revenue law and concurs in the recommendation of the Secretary of War to increase the army to 80, --000 enlisted men. He recommends legislation to prevent intrusion upon lands sot apart for Indians. Hs reoommends increased strength of fortifications and coast defenoes; alao augmenting the efficiency of the navy to place It on a footing commensurate with the necessities of ths government. He urges the vigorous prosecution of all persons found chargeable of fraud upon postal service und promises bearty co-operation iv ady lawful measures to suppress polygamy. He strongly endorses tbe public school system and advo oates popular education, recom mending liberal legislation on those subjects. Referring to tbe cowboy nuisance and their Incur sions Into Mexican territory, he oonfesses the subjsot an embarrass ing one, owing to the lack of juris diction of the general government, unless a territory applies for United States protection. He thinks tbat sucb acts are likely to embroil us with a friendly oountry and might perhaps be considered as an offense against the United States. He also tblnkstbat the army might be used as a posse commutatus to as sist tbe territorial authorities without any practical Infringe ment of the rsoent law forbidding II to be sealed. The questions growing out of tbe Panama oanal are of grave national importance. Colombia haa pro posed tbat the European Powers should join In tbe guarantee of tbe neutrality of the oanal. Tbls weald oontravene our obligations as sole guarauteer of the Integrity of tbe Colombian territory. Fore seeing a probable rellanoe In Eng. land Id tbe provisions of the Clay ton-Bulwer treaty, tbe President has proposed to the British govern ment a modification of the treaty and an abrogation of suoh clauses as do net oonform with the oblige tions of tbo TJulted States toward Colombia. Be reviewed the In dian problem at muoh length and reoommends tbe passage of an aot making the laws of tbe various States and Territories applicable to the Indian reservation within their jurisdiction.
