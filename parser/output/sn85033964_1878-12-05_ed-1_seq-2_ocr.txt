The Supreme Court of the United Sia ca having decided that the Tor bett issue of the Ba.uk of Ienue see was legally issued tmd the State is bound for lis itdi iiiitioti, it will probably bound upward very'iajiid lv from 30 cents towards par. We learn that at b ant $200,000 of this issue is owned in Maury county by W. J. Wliitthome, J M. Mays, John Frierson, Lucius Frierson and oth erB. The whole amount of this issue outstanding is $800,000, which will necessitate a levy upou the property of 'M cents for this specific purpose. Of course this will pre clude the possibility of any imme diate settlement of the State debt.. J'.nt suppose the same high tribunal, the Supreme Court of the United States, should decide that the .past due coupons of the State were re ceivable for taxes! Then the bond holders would have us bound hand and foot. The decisions of that court are law, whether right or wroDg. Had we not better com pro- mise with them as soon as practica ble? Such a decision is no more improbable or unjust than the one just made. The toils are tighten ing. It is 11 knot for the Lcgisla lure to untie. What will it do. What can it do? Echo answers What! While it is impracticable not to say impossible for the debt to be settled, atonce.it is important that immediate steps should beta ken to that end. The debt is Accu mulating at n fearful rate $1,500, 000 per annum and the sooner it is itdjusted the better. Dr. K. L. Drake of Fayetteville is a candidate for State Librarian, a position for which he is eminently qualified. We have no disparage ments to make of the qualifications of others, and especially do we dis claim any reflection upon the claims and qualifications of Mrs. llaskill, should slit be a candidate. But the qualifications of Dr. Drake are pe culiar. J Icing a graduate of the Universitv of N. C. a gentleman of literary tastes and culture, and edi tor of "Drake's Annals of the Army of lennessce and fc.arly Western History," he could and would be useful to the State in coupling the duties of Slate Librarian and editor of the periodical named, in keep ng up tne current History 01 tue iSute and exhuming the past for publication. If the olllee was at our option, hc could bestow it upon no man whose personal claims would be stronger, orwlu.se qualifi cations are more conspicuous. The calendar of the House of Rep resentatives, which has just been officially prepared, is larger, say the clerks, than any' calendar that has been ready for a second session of Congress for years. It is a docu ment of thirty-live pages, and con tains seven reports of committees and bills undisposed ot, which mean that they have had partial consider ation: live House bills and resolu tions, wiili Senate amendments; 11(5 from the Senate on first and second reading; four concurrent resolutions, ninety-one bills in Committee of the Whole on the Congress. The Congress of the United States assembled on Monday. The President's Message was read to both houses. Senator Beck intro duced a bill to retire the. trade dol lar and for its coinage into the standard trade dollai. Senator Voorhies also introduced a bill of the same import. Senator Harris introduced a bill providing for the investigation of the causes of and discover of the means by which yellow fever and cholera may be pre vented if possible. Senator Blaine has set up the usual -nowi already through a res olution "inquiring" into the late elections. Only ten Seuato-s were absent the first day. In the House 220 members were present the first day, but nothing was done except to hear and dis cuss the 1 resident s message. Mr. Wood of New York criticised and condemned that part of the message which referred to Southern elec tions, citing Congress to only two isolated instances in South Carolina and Louisiana, but ignoring greater violations in Northern States. He said that the President had changed front and bad placed himself into the hands of the radical wing of the adical party. Mr. Garfield defend ed the President, of course. The discussion was animated and interesting. FABHHTCrTCirS 

ASSAS1NAT10N. Additional Particulars of That Ter rible Tragedy Bill Porter, the Suspected Assassin, Waives Preliminary Examination. Elver Disaster. A collision occurred on the Mis sissippi river last Monday between tho steamers Charles Morgan and the Cotton Valley, which resulted in the Sinking of the Cotton Valley and the loss of a number of lives. rhe boat was struck on her star board side, just forward of the cyl inder, and sunk in fifteen minutes. Her engine was disabled by the collision, and would not move. The morning watch was on the point of eing changed. Half of .the crew and all of the passengers were isleeo, and besides, it was raining uriously and blowing a gale of wind. Instantly there was a scene of confusion. The Charles Morgan endeavored to run alongside and throw a line, which fell short, and she was blown down the stream. A life boat was put overboard from the Valley and Captain M. II. Koung, his wife, two children and an old lady put into it. Meanwhile she had sunk until the wave? dash ed over her lower deck floating the ight freight into the tiver. A rantic crowd stood upon the hurri cane deck shrieking for help. stute of the Union, and 22." bills on the private calendar. Just about one eighth part of these bids will get through. The State debt is up for discus sion ngain, but we beg to be ex cused just now. We have had our say fully heretofore. We wanted the late extra stssion to settle it, and think ,et it ought to have done so. However, we don't like the late dictatorial ultimatum of the bond holders, it is ill limed, not to say ill-tempered, and will not impress taxpayers as being an emanation from men who sincerely desiic com promise ami settlement. A Proposed Yellow Fever Act. Washington Dispatch: A bill will be introduced early during the coming session of Congress to es tablish a national quarantine against the yellow fever. It is proposed, under authority of the United States, to establish a quarantine, to begin on May 1st of each year and to terminate about November 20th, and to confide its enforcement to the Navy Department. The power of Congress to regulate com merce with foreign countries is be lieved to be ample for the purpose, and the expense will hardly be permitted to stand in the way of establishing a system calculated to save a larjre section of the country from the terrible devastation b which it has been afflicted man)" times. It is probable that the Pres ident, in his forthcoming annual message, will earnest!) recommend to Congress the passage of a meas ure of this kind. The Vote for Governor. Hon. Ceo. S.

Washington Special to the Cin Cincinnati Enquirer: The represen taiives 01 loieign governments in Washington look anxiously for the daily bulletins ot the progress of the conflict between Great Britain and Afghanistan, for it is generally believed in diplomatic circles that it will result in war with Russia, and ultimately lead to a general European war. Some of the best informed members of the Diplo matic Corps entertain this opinion ami have reached this conclusion after most careful examination of all the attendant circumstances. Sunday's American: John Du ling, yesterday, received the follow ing graphic description of the Farmington assassination from his brother, Thomas Dulisg, who is on a visit at that place: "The whole county is excited over the Neil affair, and I will give you an exact account of the whole proceeding. Friday night Neil's bnrn was discovered on fire, and of course everybody went there. As usual 1 outrun every one except Osro Nowlin, and I would have beat him bad I not had to dress. Everyone began to suspect Bill Porter, even while the barn was burning, and on Saturday morning C. A. Armstrong and Thomas Jones, of Lewisburg, came over and took out two warrants for Por'er, one for attempted murder and one for burning the barn I hey hunt ed him all Saturday night but fail ed to find him. Sunday morning the)- heard of him In Bedford coun tv, and immediately went for him. The)' found him preparing to leave Stapps , a man who lives just above John Montgomery s old store. When Porter saw them coming he ran into the house and swore he would not be arrested, and it look ed very dangerous to try to take him, as he had six or seven good revolvers. He tonally surrendered and wa3 brought here Sunday even ing, but said he was not ready for trial, and was then taken to Lewis burs to await his trial, which was set for 9 o'clock. Monday morning, at this place, he asrain appeared, but was not ready for ttial, aud on Wednesday morninsr "Rsk'ed for three weeks time, which was refused. He then waived examination and was bound over to court. The evidence is very strong against him, and there is no one who does not believe him guilty, He threatened Neil s lite, and was seen by two men Friday night com ing toward Farmington with a shot gun. The man that shot Neil, had on a gum coat and black slouch hat. These articles were found at the house where Porter was arrest ed. The gun, which was the prop erty of Stapps, was also there. Mrs. Stapps says Stapps loaded the gun with slugs and buck-shot to shoot a dor. and that it had not been used until Porter took it down Friday evening. Stapps left home Sunday night for lexas. There is, in fact, such conclusive evidence against Porter that it is believed he will be taken from jail and hanged. The incendiary fire was under full headway when the shooting was done, for I had dressed myself and run to the front gate when the shot was fired, and was at the house in a very few minutes, or rather seconds, but did not enter the house for Mrs. Neil halloed to me to run for a doctor. The sun was loaded with slugs larger than a buckshot, and nine of them eptered Neil's body and right arm. Everthing Neil had was burned up, and one horse belonging to a man who lives at Franklin. Neil may get well, hut is thought to be in a critical condition now, The President's Message, Petition for Local Option. A in Hog Heat Dirt Cheap. Sunday Nashville American: large number of farmers were 1 lie city yesterday, ami manv brought pork for sale. The cold snap has been taken advantage of for hog killing on a large scale. The market was- in consequence, glutted; and at the market-house, choice cuts of pork could be bought for 2J cents per ound, while back bones and spare-ribs sold for 10 and 15 cents each, and when move was wanted as much as forty pounds was sold lor 2t cents. These puce scarcely pay for the corn consumed in fattening the hogs Exchange: The year 1878 will be a memorable one in the annals of human misery. Famine and pesti lence have done their own work in some of the most populous regions inhabited bv makind. India aud China have been devastated by both. War has added its terrors to scourge ami starvation. lu yel low lever, which has afflicted the South, is mild by .comparison with the outbreak of cholera, small-pox :ind maligant lever now carrying death into all parts of the Empire f Morocco. Such wide spread miseries rarely manifest theui selves. Our planet must have wan dered Into the company of evil stars. The New Haven Register says a careful aualysis of the recent elec tions is producing a very sobering effect upon the republicans, and whea they come face to face with the issues of 1SS0 they will find that what in 1878 they mistook for Democratic reverse ami a iHpular verdict for Republicanism, had iu effect tha reality of welding the Democratic hosl.s tuto a solid pha- anx, before which the thin Kepub- liean lines wiii stand not for an in eUnt.
