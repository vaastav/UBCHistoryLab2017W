The two leaders iu the race still express confidence of winning, but retard the situation as serious and critical. Each man known to be-in doubt is kept in 6jght and no persuasion is omitted to induce him to definitely pledge himself It is generally believed that not more than 220 members will go into the caucus. Estimates- git en show the leaders themselves are not far apart in their calculation, and render it possible that absentees or votes for minor can didates, until their Hag is buried and tho day lot, may bring victory one way or another.

Utah will also bo an appli cant for admission, but lingering traces of Mormonism will probably keep her out. Enabling acts for New Mexico and Arizona are likely to pass next spring or summer, but these states will not come iuto the Union early enough to vote for President next year. Bills for the admission of all three, territories will be offered at tho first opportunity by their dele gates in Congress. It is quite prob able (hat there will be no opposition in either house to the admission of New Mexico and Arizona if they ate not to vote for President next fall. COM HfclWO.
