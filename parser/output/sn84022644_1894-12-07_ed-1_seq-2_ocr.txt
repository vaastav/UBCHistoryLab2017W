(The cmocat. Those Grain Bags." A very reckless person writing under the slgnsture of "Citizen" has an article In Sunday's Herald in which he seems to have been engaged In a herculean effort to dodge the truth and sets as often as possible. In order that our readers may fully understand the matter at Issue we give "Citizen's" ar ticle entire: 1 notice an Item in the Democrat, where they claim that the Albany Farmers bought 50,000 grain bags at 4 yi cts and claim it Is an act of free trade in big. It ig a fact that there is always a surplus of hags left after the grain season is over. Your cor respondent with others did buy 100,000 bags delivered In Albanv a few years ago, while the tariff wa In full force, at 4,4 cents and at the time wheat was selling at 75 to So cents per bushel. It requires cash to buy bags at these prices and you will have to hold these bags eight months before there is a demand tor them. 50,000 bags coat $ 2150 Interests months 150 Freight, storage and insurance.added 100 Toial cost 1500 Making about 5 cents .per bag instead of .Tor 4. Citizen. The Democrat is informed by one ot the directors of the Farmers Co that the 50,000 sacks which they purchased are not to be delivered until next July, and that they are not to be paid for until delivered. He further says the company does not have tny freight, storage or insurance to pay. He says in other words that the 44 cents per sack covers the entire cost to the com pany. If this be so, (and we give full fai'h and credit to the statement of our infor mant,) what becomes of the reckles? and extravagent statements of "Citizen.'' It is evident thst "Citizen'' is very feaiiul that republican farmers will see and compre hend the benefits ot free trade in sacks and will be moved to sustain the new tariff law. He would like republican farmers to believe that thU great blessing of cheap sacks is due o some other cause than the removal of the duty by a democratic congress- But he is very careful not to assign any other cause. But why should "Citizen" attempt to refute the position of the Democrat that the re moval of the duty from grain sacks will cheapen them in pries to the farmers? Is not that conclusion the very vital principle of protectionism ? Does no' the hop grower say that reducing the duty on that article will compel him to sell cheaper? Do not the mine owners and the manufacturer in all protected interests declare day in and day out that if the tariff is reduced foreign products slmiliar to what tney produce will be impeded and sold here so much cheaper than they row sell for that they will be com pelled to sell cheaper or go out cf business? If the removal of the duty from a protected article does not resu't in the reduction ct price at hich the manufacturer sold the article while th; duty was on, then is there nothing in protection? Citizen's statement that he and others several ytars ago bought 100,000 sacks at 4 S cents a price when the duty was on may or may not be true. At all events the prevailing price several years ago when the duty was on was never less than 6 to 7 cents. It is not likely that cill-z-n bought 100,000 sacks of the quality and size of those recently bought by the Far mers Co for 4jj cents each, lie is request ed to tell the public hat kind of sacks he bought and in what year he bough: them. The above argument of "Citizen" is in keeping with every argument made to sup port he tariff scheme. A plain, palpable fallacy .ireurs in it, McKinley, Reed.Hoar and every leading republican says that re moving the duty will reduce the price at whic1! manufacturer sold while Ci'izen argues otherwise. The Financial Plan. President Cleveland in his message speaking of financial reform says: This condition cannot be immediately reached, but as a step in that direction and as a means of securing- a more elastic cur rency and obviating other objections to the present arrangement of bank circula tion, tbe secretary of the treasury presents in his report a scheme modifying tbe pre ent banking laws and providing for the is sue o! circulating notes by state banks free from taxation, under certain limitations. The secretary explains his plan so plainly, and its advantages are developed by him with such remarkable clearness, that any ffcrton my part to present argument in its support would be superfluous. I shall, therefore, content myself with an unquali fied indorsement of the secretary's pro posed changes in the law and a brief and an imperfect statement of their prominent features. It is proposed to repeal all laws providing for tbe deposit of United States bonds as security for circulation; to permit national banks to isue circulating notes not exceeding in amount 75 per cent of their pa'd up and unimpaired capital, pro vided they deposit with the government as a guarantee fund in United Stales legal tender notes, including treasury notes of 1890. a sura of equal amount to 30 percent of tbe notes they desire to isrue; this de posit to be maintained at all limes, bat whenever any bank re'ires any part of its circula'ion a proportiona'e part of its guar, antee fund shall be returned to it; to per mit Ihe secretary of the treasury to prepare and ktep on hand ready for issue in care an increase in circulation is desired, blank national bank notes for each bank having circula'ion, and to repeal the provisions of the prefer, t law imposing limitations and restrictions, thus permitting such increase or reduction within the limit cf tho 75 per rent of capital, to as quickly made as emergencies arise. In addition to the guarantee fund required, it is proposed to provide a sufety fund for the immediate redemption of the circulating notes of fail ed binks by imposing a small annual tax, say one-half of I per ;nt upon Ihe aveage circula'ion of each bank until tbe fund amounts to 5 percent o' the tofal circula tion outstanding. When a bank fails its guarrantec fund is to lw paid into this sifety fund, and its notes are to lie redeemed in the first in stance from such safety fund thus augment ed. Any impairment of such fund caused thereby to be mae'e good fron. the imme diately available cash assets of said bank, and if these suouli' be insufficient such im pairment to be made good b a pre rata assessment among the other banks, tboir contributions constituting a first lien upon the assets of the- tailed bank in favor of the contributing banks. As a further security, it is conterr. plated that the existing pro vision lixin the individual liabilities of stockholders is to be retaineJ, and the bank's indebtedness on account of its cir culating n;t'es is to be made a first lien on til Its assets. For the purpose of meeting the expense of printing notes.ofticia! super vision, cancellation and other like charges, there shall be paid a tax, gay one half of 1 per cent per annum cn the average amount of noles in c;icutation. It is further pro vided that there shall be no national bank note) issued for less denomination than 910 and that each national bank, except in cag of a tailed banki shall release or ret:re its notes in the first instance at its own office or at agencies to be originated by it, and so a fixed reserve may be maintained on ac count of deposits. Another very import ant feature of this plan is tbe exemption of state banks from taxation by the United States In cases where it is shown to the sat isfaction of the secretary of the treasury and controller of currency by banks claim ing such exemption, that they have not had outstanding their circulating notes exceed ing 75 per cent of their paid and unim paired capital : That their stockholders are individually liable for the redemption of the'r circulating no'.ei to the full extent of their ownerolil? of stock; that the liabil ity ot said banks upon their circulating notes constitutes under t! eir state law a first lien upon their assets ; that such banks have kept and maintained a guarantee fund In United States legal tender notes, including United Slat's treasury notes of ifoo, equal to M per cent of their ou'standing -.circulat ing notes, and such banks have ptomptly redeemed their circuiting no .es when pre sented at their principal or branch offices. It is quite likily that this scheme miy be usefully amended In some of Its detaiis,but I am satisfied it furnishes a basis for for a very great Improvement in our present banking and currency system. YVashitmton Letter. From cur regular Correspondent, Washington, Nov. 26, I894. Of course President Cleveland and Sec retary Carlisle were pteased to have sub sc'lptlons for more than three times the amount of the bond issue submitted in an swer to the call, but they had both expect ed quite as favorable a showing. If it should be detirmlncd, as now seems prob able, the enti'e issue shall be sold V a syndicate represented by the United States Trust Company's bid, which is on a bais of 2 . per cent interest on the bonds, the record for placing bonds at the lowest rate of interest will have been broken. The matter will be sealed early this week. In any event no matter which of the bidder get the bonds, the interest will not exceed 3 per cent. It is hoped tie gold reserve fund will be strengthened to almost the total amount that will be received from the sale of the bond, but It will be several weeks before that can be definitely known. Whether the democrat c members of the House will carry out their announced inten tion of attacking this bond issue remains to be seen. They will not, if they follow the advice of their more conservative co'. legurs who realize that no possible good can come out of such aa attack . Democrats are doing more thinking than talking these day, and one of the result is a proposition that meet with much favor amosg the few demociatic Congressmen who have reached Washington. This proposi tion is in the nature of a suggestion to Pres ident Cleveland, that he omit from his mes sage to Congress all financial recommends - tions, except tbat a monetary commission be authorized by Congress, to be appointed by the President.which shall make a thorough Investigation of our entire financial system and report what ought to be done. This proposition is in the interest of party har mony and is backed by two members of .he Cabinet Secretary Morton and Attorney- General Olney, and some influenzal Con gressmen; but as President Clevelanl. and Secretary Carlisle have some very decided ideas about what our financial system needs the suggestion may not be adopts). There is a probability that Capt Mow- gatc, the man who defaulted for a large sum while acting as Disbursing Officer of the Signal Service, some fourteen years ago. aid who wa las: summer run down a" J brought back Ij Washington through the instrumentality of Secre ary Morton, may after all escape punishment. The old in dictment against him are faulty many believe purposely made so by his republi can friends and so far search for the paper In bis case, upon which a new indictment could be found, has been ineffect ual, and some of the most important wit nesses against him are dead It is believed that the papers were purpo'ely destroyed years ago by those who shared in Holgate's stealing and since it was learned that they were missing tbe number who think that those sharer in eluded officials of promi nence at tnat lime has largely increased The District Attorney expresses confidesce that eooagh witnesses are still at his dis posal to make a good case against Howgate, but that confidence is not shared by the general pnblic. Chairman Ssyers.of the House committee on Appropriations, has got his committee at Work, in order that one or two of the regular Appropriation bills may be ready to report to the House soon after ihe re ascmbling of Congress.

President Cleveland has no' been to the White House for more than a we:k, owin;. to a painful attack of his old enemy, ie rheumatic gout, but It fits nut prevented his keeping at wort on his message. The members of the sub committee of the Bouse Committee on Judiciary, who are charged with tbe duty of investigating the serious charges made against Judge Flicks, will tmet at Cleveland, Ohio, this week. Members of the committee who have been in Washington expect that the inve ligation will be made complete in time for a report to be made to the Judiciary Com m it tee at its firs meeting after the open ing of tbe session of Congress. Col Simmons, Collector f Internal Rev enue for tbe Eastern District cf S C, who is visiting Washington, says of tbe legis -lature of that State and the coming elec tion by it of the two U S Senators one to fill the unexpired term of the late Senator Vance, which runs until March 3. 18V7,and the other to succeed Ransom, whose term expires March 3, 1895: "The democrats have ten Senators out of fifty and in tbe House forty-fiv: members out of one hun dred and twenty. Tbe remainder Is pretty evenly divided between the repub'icans and populists, with a slight proportion in favor of the latter. I have no doubt that the two Senator will be elee'ed without any wranple One will 'je a lepublican and one a populist; but if Marlon Butler goes to tbe Senate, as now seems likely, there will be virtually two republicans, ax be Is a republican at heart. On the stump he attacked the Senate tariff bill, and claim ed that the McKinley kill was preferab'eto it. He is a protectionist and will vote with tbe republicans on organization and on everything else. Tbe populist leaders. by the way, are really republicans."

It has been a favorite theme of the Ore gonian to descant upon the favoritism shown the sugar refiner in the Wilson tar iff bill. It has persistently nlltd the meas ure the Havemeyer bill for the purpose of bringing it into disfavor. But Havemey er who is the great leader in the sugar trust scheme has known all the while that the present tariff jaw was far more detri mental to the monopolistic purposes of the trust than was the McKinley bill. Havemeyer lately expresses the follow ing very emphatic opinion about the mat ter. "Tho reaction that followed the passing of the Tariff bill brought about a dull sea son, and the war among the wholesale grocers in several sections of the country still further tended to demoralize trade. When to this we added the excitement of an election canvass and the general report that Congress would pass a Free Sugar bill, making all sugars free, you can read ily see there was enough cause to compel us to shut down completely. "But we ran our works up to tbe present time with a reduced force in the hope, Mt-cawber-like, that something would turn up. Our faith in the future has failed us, and beginning tomorrow we shall shut down all our works in Boston, New York, Phil adelphia and Baltimore- We cannot do anything else. We are sorry for our men. and have been trying to ward it off all along. But the truth is we haye been run ning our works at a loss for several months. "But it is time now to call a halt. Tbe last Congress is responsible for the present situation, and if they pass the Free Sugar bill at Washington, as it is reported they will, they will kill tbe sugar ,'ndustry com pletely. Things cannot b- made woise than they arc now. There is very little difference between the prices of raw and re fined sugar, and there is no reason or jus tice in continuing a business at a heavy loss. "We must either have enough profit to cover the bald expenses of carrying on su gar refining or else go out of tbe business completely. We cannot compete with the wages paid in F.urope, and our men could ' not begin to support themselves and their families at such figures. Vet we are asked to run our establishment with only the margin in refining that is to be found be tween the cost of raw and refined sugars. which Is now a trifle less than h cent a pound. "No, the only thing for us to do is to shut down corup'etely until there is a market for our gols and until we can see our way to nay expenses. And I can see nothing cheering or reassuring in the out- lo k at the present moment." Pensions. On the subject of pensions President Cleveland speaks in no dubious tone. In Ms message he says: At the close of the lat fical yrar. June 30, 1894, there were 99.S44 persons on our ; pension rails, being a net increase of 35$! j over the number reported at tne end of the previous year 1 bec pensioners may be ' classified is follow;: j Sol-ijefs ana tailor, survivors of sP wsrs 754.968 .

Tbe sum nece- j ssry to meet pension expenditure for the j year ending June 30, 1S96, i climated at j $140,000,000. Tbe commis.'ioner of pensions is of the j opinion that tbe year 189J, being the 30th j after :he close of the war of the rebellion. must, according to all sensible human cal ' cola1 ions see trie highest limit of the pension i roll, and that, after that year, it must begin ': to decline. Tbe claims pending in tbe bu ! reaa have decreased more than oo.oco dnr j fng tbe year. A large proportion of the new ; claims filed are for an increase of pension J by those now oa the rolls.

Among our pensioners are nine widow and three daughter of ccldiert of the Revolutionary tsar, and 45 survivors of the war of 1812. Tbe barefaced and extensive pension frauds, exposed under the direction of the courageous and ge-.erous veer an sold:er now at Ihe head of the bureau, leave no room for the c'alm that no purga:ion cf our pen sion roll was needed, or that continued vig ilance and piompt action are not necessary j to the same end.

On the subject of tariff legislation the president in hs message says 1 The tariff act passed at tbe last session of ixingress needs important amendments if it is to be executed effectively and with cer tainty. In addition to such necessary amendments as will not change the rates of duty, I am still very decidedly in favor of putting coal and iron upon the free list . So far as tbe sugar schedule Is concerned, 1 would be glad, under the existing aggra vations, to see every particle of differential duty in favor of refined sugar stricken out of our tariff law. If with all the favor ac corded the sugar-refining interest in our tariff laws, it still languishes' to the extent of closing refineries and discharging thou sands of workmen, it would seem to pre sent a hopeless case for reasonable legisla tion, Wna'ever else is done or omitted, 1 earnestly repeat here the recommendation I have made In another portion of this com munication, that the additional duty of 1 10th of a cmt per pound laid upon su gar imported from countries paying a bounty on Ita export be abrogated. It seems to me that exceedingly important considerations point to the propriety of this amendment with tbe advent of a new tariff policy not only calculated to relieve the consumers of our land in the cost of their daily life; but to invite a better de velopment of American thrift and create for us closer and more profitable commerci al relations with the rest of the world, it follows as a logical and imperative neces sity that we should at once remove tbe chief, It not tbe only obstacle which ha so long prevented our participation in the foreign carrying trade of the sea. A tar iff built upon the theory that it is well to check imports, and that a home market should bound the industry and effort of American producers, was fitly supplement ed by a refusal to allow American registry to vessels built abroad, though owned and navigated by our people, thus exhibiting a willingness to abandon all contest for tbe advantage of American trans-oceanic car riage. .Our new tariff policy, built upon tbe theory that It is welt to encourage such importations as our people need, and that our products and manufactures should find markets in every part of the habitable globe, is consistently supplemented by the Seat est possible liberty to our citizens In e ownership and navigation of ships in which our products and manufactures may be transported . The millions now paid to foreigners for carrying American pascen -gers and product across the sea should be turned into American hand. Shipbuild ing, which has been protected to strangu lation, should be revived by the prospect of profitable employment for ships when bulH, and tbe American sailor should be resur rected and again tk bis place, a sturdy and industrious citizen in time of peace and a patriotic and safe defender of Amer ican interest in the days of conflict. The ancient provision of our law. denying American registry to ship built abroad and owned by Americans, appears in the light of present conditions not only to be a failure for good at every point, but to be nearer a relic of barbarism than anything that exists under the permission of a stat ute of the United States. 1 earnestly rec ommend its prompt repeal.
