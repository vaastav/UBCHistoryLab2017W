FRANK STONE I IS RELEASED PRISONERS IN COUNTY JAIL SHRED HIS CLOTHES. PROVIDED WITH TROUSERS BY FRIEND This morning a very amusing and & yet pathetic scene occurred In the basement or the court house when Turnkey Thomas Tucker released from custody Prank Stone, a young '"man at about 22 years of age, who this morning finished serving his I sentence of 30 days Imposed upon him II sofe time ago -by Justice Amos. The young man. when he was plac- T od within the confines of the jail had a nice suit of clothes, a nice overcoat, and was very well dressed, but It seems that after his arrival In the jail I the other prisoners who were not lucky enough to have any good o clothes became jenlous of Stones' b splendid attire, and a conspiracy was A hatched among the prisoners, with w the result that a number of them one tl day gathered around Stone and pro- n ceeded to tear his trousers In rags cl and strips, each one of the prisoners o making a rip, and as there were about 30 prisoners In the jail, the trousers (j were well frayed. Of course during his confinement In t; i me palace or detention the condition y ,of his clothing did not bother him ti much, but this morning when Tucker ?\ notified him that ho was a free man ti he called attention to the condition of his cloting. and Tucker told him j, to wait a short time and he would get t him a pair of trousers, and the pris- j: oners thought that Stone was to re- ^ ceivo a new suit, but when the n trousers appeared in the hands of Tucker they were found to be merely a pair of old overalls which some 0 painter had left around the building, a and they were thick with the many f layers of paint which Is always found j, on the overclothos of these workmen. ti L When the man sa"w their condition [ he went before Squire Amos and told ? ! him that he would rather be put back ? in jail than to go out with such |i clothing, but after a while some kind hearted individual looked him up a _ pair of fairly respectable trousers, the Chief of Police bought him shoe j strings for his shoes, his overcoat was ' restored to him, and he left the place in pretty good condition. i uuirr RI inuKTrn ll Ill L nLILIiniLU MINERAL COUNTY FARMER SUES LUMBERMAN FOR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF AFFECTION KKYSEJl.
