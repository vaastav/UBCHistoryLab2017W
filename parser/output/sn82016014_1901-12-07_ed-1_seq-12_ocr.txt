The State Journal Is a member of h . i 1 t -. rK1vs the lull day telegraph report of that rreat news organization for exclusive afternoon puo lioation in Topeka. .. tr. The news Is received In the State Jour, ral building over wires for this sole pur pose, busy through the entire day. A complete copy of the night report Is also received. Miss Helen Stone appears to have more lives than a cat. The ice trust is having a nice long rest from the annoyances which, were showered upon It in the summer. The man who does the figuring has neglected to tell us how much per head the inhabitants of the Danish West Indies cost us. A great treasury surplus is regarded c a mpnara to the country, but a de ficit is a menace to the political party that permits it. It will take one more turn of the crank by the U. S. supreme court to do away with the tariff at the Philippine end of the line. The imperialists die hard. The $100,000 which Kubelik Is to re ceive for 100 concerts in this country, is regarded by the Hartford Post as be ing in the nature of compensation for being compelled to bear a name like that. The complimentary way in which the president referred to the fighting quali ties of the Indians in a conversation with a delegation of TJtes on day this week, indicates that he is planning to capture the Indian vote. The fact that the United States su preme court is divided five to four on its opinion on every insular case, show a lack of unanimity which is unusual, when it is considered that the division is not made on partisan political lines. It is evident now. that Pat Crowe is no gentleman. That was a mean trick that he played on the Omaha police. They have been waiting so long for him to come in and surrender as he promis ed to do that the wonder is they don't go out and arrest him. It would serve him right. The Detroit Free Press classes Thomas B. Ferguson, the newly ap pointed governor of Oklahoma as a Democrat. Fred Vandergrift says it is clearly wrong, because Ferguson Is a Methodist preacher, and all Methodist preachers in Kansas and Oklahoma are Republicans. Now it is the missionaries in Samoa who have cost Uncle Sam a big lot of money. They charged the governor of Tutuila, Capt. Tilley, with being drunk while on duty. The government spent pomething like $100,000 investigating the charge, and the court of inquiry finds that It is not true. The rural free delivery service has passed the experimental stage, accord ing to the annual report of Postmaster General Smith, and will be rapidly ex tended throughout the country. By the end of this year the service will reach a population of 5.700,000. and it is estimated that within four years it will be extended to 21.000,000. . That portion of the music loving pub lic which is expecting to go to Kansas City to hear Mr. Grau's singers will be anxious to know who Is to do the sing ing. Calve has gone to Florida to give Jier voice a chance to recuoerate from the effects of the climate that she en countered in the "Italy of America." Eames will go direct to St. Louis and nvait for the company there. Sybil San derson will remain at her old. home in Fan Francisco to have an operation per formed upon her throat. Perhaps Mr. Grau figures that any old singer ia good enough for Kansas City. The renewed attention to trade condi tions between the United States and the American countries lying south of lier borders, due in part to the meet ing of the Pan-American congress at the City of Mexico, has attracted some attention to a statement by a British official in Mexico, Consul Biorklund, which has just reached the treasury bureau of statistics. That officer calls attention sharply to the fact that in the one American country at the south with which the United States has satis factory transportation facilities, Mex ico, the trade of the United States has vastly outgrown that of other nations. Fifty years ago the trade of Mexico was carried on by British houses, and as late as 1872-'73 was in a fairly flour ishing condition, but since the opening of the Mexican Central and Mexican National railways American manufac turers have yearly increased their trade with the republic Today the British trade is confined to a few agencies, who by means of samples and catalogues undertake the execution of orders. Some of the large British houses employ travelers, who can al ways count on their usual customers for orders; but other houses frequently Bend out such unsuitable men. often foreigners, that they are unable to get a Single order. 

EXPOSITION WHICH COUNTS For nearly a week the South Carolina and West Indies exposition has been open to the world at Charleston, S. C. To some it would seem that this show business is being slightly overdone, but there are reasons why the present one should succeed, and that recommend it to the people of the whole country. In the first place its great end is to build up the interests of the only ruler of the southland, cotton. There seems to be no spot on the globe where this plant thrives as it does in the southern states of America, and the world looks to that section for much of the fabric with which to clothe itself. But within two years, the Oriental trade has been seriously damaged by the international difficulties in China. Cotton has been a drug on the market of the east and the producers have with characteristic far sightedness and shrewdness determined to attempt opening up new marts for their wares. In the West Indira there Is a demand and in order that those isl ands may get in close toux!h with the country whence is likely in the future to come so much of their cotton, it was decided to interest them in an exposi tion That is one use of the fair at Charleston, opened a week ago and to continue during the winter months. Then there is much to benefit the peo ple of a nation who can have something to draw them out of the old grooves in which they are accustomed to move with the least possible resistance and at the same time with an ever narrow ing tendency. Think of the broadening influence which a visit of ten days would have upon a farmer from the hills of New England. Or indeed, a little closer to the home of the fair it self, what will it not do for the moun taineers of that section of the land which it is to represent? Through this exposition too, Dixie will be doing its part toward the obliteration, of some past events which anything less than an great exposition in which all the ends of the nation will be drawn up together and forced to acquaint them selves with one another would fail. South Carolina was in slavery times the hot-bed of secessionism. From it came the great champion of states rights, Calhoun, and near its shores was fired the first gun of the great Civil war against the walls of Fort Sumter. So, that in this respect, in trying to live down the past, the South, if really there be such a district of the country any more, is showing a broad and kind ly spirit which is to redound to the ben efit of that section in years to come. There are advantages which conduce to swelling the attendance at this fair. Generally over this portion of the west ern hemisphere there have been abund ant crops, money is circulating freely, and everybody feels good. Northerners have an inducement in going down to Charleston where the climate is salu brious. A few days only spent in a city of the South would make the long severe cold of the Northern winter much more bearable. Railroad rates will be cheap and living In that city should be at a figure which most peo ple could afford. Congress failed to render any assist ance to this enterprise, but it is hoped that the management, with the aid of the resourceful citizens of that country will surprise the United States and the world by showing them that even if they receive no help from the general government the enterprise can still be put through and brought to a success in every way. 

WINTER MUSINGS. While the astronomical winter does not begin until December 22, the practi cal period came to Kansas with the first of the month. Gray scudding clouds and mournful winds with a rapidly changing temperature told us that fall had flown far more accurately than almanac dates or the asteroids. But there are many Interesting facts about this holiday month that the al manacs reveal with brief research. He who rises and retires with the sun will go to bed these days about 4:38 and get up at 7:04. The last day of the year will be nine hours and seven minutes in length. The new moon appears on the after noon of the 10th and like many a cheer ful citizen will become full on the morning of Christmas. There will be five Sundays in the month, also Mondays and Tuesdays. The shortest afternoons come in the third week when the day is barely over nine hours. Then the sun reaches the winter solstice and starts again on its northward course. In ancient times this turning of old Sol from its southward motion to the north, giving longers days and shortening of nights and presaging the spring, was observed as a festival of Joy and gladness. Traces of the feast time are still to be found in Italy and ancient Rome. The fathers of the church placed the Christmas merry-making at the present date to give the people a sub stitute for the Roman affair in which much killing often happened. December is essentially a month of merrymaking in which cares and business troubles are laid aside where possible. May each and all be able to truthfully exclaim at the close of the thirty-first day: "I have tried to do some good deed toward my fellowmen and to take some steps towards my own improvement." 

LESSON OF THE HALL CASE. There is a lesson in the Hall murder case which has occupied the attention of the district court this week, for ev ery officer in the service of the city or state. It is an old lesson but it is one that must be studied again and again. It refers to the treatment' of prisoners by men clothed with police authority. It is not often necessary for an officer to kill hi3 prisoner or to even pound him with a club. Policemen too often place too small a value on human life. The man who has committed a petty offense is regarded in the light of hav ing forfeited his right to existence and the consequence is that men are often brutally beaten or even killed whose offense might be entirely overlooked by a Jury of men .who are not guided by prejudice. That is why only men with cool heads should be invested with the badge of police authority. It si ay be true that the officer who pounds a man over the head with a heavy club does not intend to kill him but he certainly does know that at best his victim must suffer cruelly. There is seldom excuse for a roliceman using a club but the fre quency with which he resorts to this method of subjugating prisoners makes it almost a puzzle why more of them are not compelled to face a charge of murder. PAVING PROBLEMS. Topeka should stop and enjoy a brief breathing spell before making contracts for a great deal more pavement. While the paving craze has been at its height the city has apparently forgotten that those already here must be cared for and preserved. While a contract was in force for the maintenance of the asphalt pavements no attention whatever has been paid to any other. The time has come when something must be done with West Sixth avenue. The ' pavement, is of cedar blocks and they are in a woeful state of disinte gration. This pavement is so bad that it is really dangerous, and It is next to criminal not to give it immediate, at tention. The limestone block pavement on East Sixth avenue is also In a deplor able condition and demands attention. And to cap it all, the contract for the maintenance of the asphalt has expired and must be taken care of at once. The Barber Asphalt Paving company may at the next meeting of the council submit propositions looking to a re newal of the repair contract which the city has recently been trying to close up and terminate. The company, it is said, will submit a proposition to re move all the old asphalt from whatever streets the council may direct, and lay a new binder and surface, for the sum of $1.40 a square yard, guaranteeing the job for seven years. Another proposition for resurfacing old pavement at the rate of about 10 cents a square yard is also likely to be submitted. At the request of several councilmen, the Barber company may also submit estimates on laying pave ment to fill up the abandoned East Fifth street car tracks. Several coun cilmen are very much in favor of hav ing this work done. E. B. Demarest, the :. Kansas City manager for the Barber company, was in Topeka this week, and will come again next week. He was here nom inally for the purpose of seeing about some repairs to the asphalt laying ma chinery, but the real purpose of his visit was to find out the sentiment of the city officials and councilmen on the sub ject of a contract. While here Mr. Demarest did not say positively that his company would submit propositions to the council at once, but said that he would like to arrange with the city for a new contract on whktever basis the city might prefer. '' Several of the councilmen have ex pressed themselves as being unalter ably opposed to any further dealings with the Barber company, on the ground that it has an absolute monop oly on the so-called PItoh Lake asphalt. The other kind of asphalt, called land asphalt. Is claimed by some to be as good as Pit oh Lake asphalt, and is very much cheaper. The old asphalt contraot, which Is just now being terminated, provided that for the sum of $20,000 the com pany should keep the pavements In re pair for five years. The city thinks it would save money by paying for its re pairs by the Buare yard, and a con tract on that basis will likely be made with some company. But at any rate the asphalt pavement must be cared for, and without delay. The city is face to face with a serious proposition, and new pavements can wait until it is solved. CARS IfOR THE CROWDS. Something should be done by the To peka Street Railway company to pro vide adequate accommodations for the early morning and late afternoon pas sengers. If a man pays for a seat in a car he is entitled to the seat. Tet all men are looked upon as hogs who do not peace fully surrender their seats to women passengers who would otherwise be obliged to stand. Inborn American courtesy and respect for women makes It natural for men to do this. But it la unjust for the street car company to demand such a sacrifice from a passen ger who has paid for a seat. It is doubly unjust that a hard work ing Santa Fe shopman, or one of the 500 woolen mill employes of the city, should be obliged to give up his seat to a well dressed female shopper, whose silks and satins rustle as she stands in front of the tired-out workman and glares at him suggestively. Nine times out of ten the glare proves effective. The dainty creature drops into the workman's seat without any token of gratitude, or at best a matter-of-fact bow. Everyone who has occasion to come down town between 6 and 7 in the morning, or to return about 8 at night knows the invariably crowded condi tions of the cars, especially upon cer tain lines leading to those parts of town where the working people live. The street car company should provide trailers on these crowded lines. It should not try to haul twice as many people on a car as the car was built to hold. Every passenger is entitled to a seat. The 6 o'clock morning and evening cars on nearly all the lines in the city should carry trailers. It is no more than simple Justice to the people who ride on the cars, and it will increase the patronage of the cars if the tired-out business man and laborer knows that he can get into a car, and sit down while on his way home. The patronage of the car company is increasing, and everybody is glad of it- But the com pany should increase Its facilities, and give people what they pay for. GLOBE SIGHTS. From the Atchison Globe. Lots of people enjoy a good runaway on a crowded street. Most women forgive smoking, in the men, but chewing bah! Nothing makes a mother quite so mad as to have her children contradict her. Before going to work in the morning the chimney sweep carefully dirties his lace. When you, suddenly meet a man you hate, ever remark that you hope you are looking well? After a woman nasses forty, she be gins to complain that every style of ciotnes makes her iook tat. There is some reason for it if a man snarls at you; probably the man he met before you kicked at him. "I am eighty years old," we heard a man say lately, "and, I never knew but one woman who acted natural." We wonder if those robes the angels wear ever cause the women wearers trouble by coming apart in the back. We have never eaten anything that tasted as good as the contents of a workingman's lunch bucket seem to taste to him. In a show to be presented at the the ater shortly a farmer will attempt to blow out an electric light. Ha, ha ha! It must be very funny. Clothing that fits does not seem to be fashionable this year. Look at the overcoats worn by the men. and the cloaks worn by the women. It is not hard to become popular;- a certain Atchison woman is popular be cause she take all the kittens her neighbors want to get rid of. A woman we know gets up at five o'clock every morning, but permits her husband and son to sleep until noon. "They're less trouble in bed than any where else," she says in explanation. POINTED PAR A GRAPHS. From the Chicago News. The burden of love is never too heavy. Money is the sugar that sweetens the miser's life. Religion makes good armor, but it's no good as a cloak. It is better to hit the nail on the bead than on the finger. It takes a small boy and a pot of Jam to mark table linen quickly. The average husband imagines his wife is a part of the property he owns. Poverty has kept lots of people from making laughing stocks of themselves. Don't imagine you are cut out for a school teacher merely because you have pupil in your eye. It sometimes happens that a bachelor envies a married man almost as much as a married man envies a bachelor. A Kansas girl who recently lost her voice has received twenty-seven offers of marriage. QUAKER REFLECTIONS. From the Philadelphia Record.! The man who knows the least shows it the most. Children who eat at the second table take after their parents. This would be a better world if all persons took their own advice. Knowledge is power except in the case of a man who knows he's been whipped. Conscience," says the ManayunK Philosopher, "is that within us that tells us when other people are doing wrong." Married life is not all sunshine, re marked Mrs. Henpeck. "No," said Hen peck, sadly; "most of it is reign." Nell "I wonder why Maine gave her age as only 22 when she married old Moneybags?" Belle "Probably she was giving a discount for cash." "I think you will suit." said the mis tress; "how about a reference?" "That's all right, mum," answered the hirecT lady, affably; "I loike yer looks. Never moind a riference." Hoax "I hear that J. Pierpont Mor gan was one time financially embar rassed. Joax Yes; he had more money than he knew what to do with." "No: the editor is not in." said the Janitor; "can I do anything for you?" I don t know, remarked the visitor. doubtfully; "are you connected with the poetical department?" "Yes; I empty the waste basket." REFLECTIONS OF A BACHELOR. From the New York. Press. Some children can respect their fath ers if they don't see too much of them. No good housewife is ever satisned with her cook till she has discharged her seven or eight times. You don't have to fall out of love as swiftly as out of a balloon to be fur ther when you land. The average man who has been ac cepted acts a week later about as cheerful as when he has caught a bad cold. Occasionally you lend a man money and he astonishes you by returning it; once in a long, long while he makes you think you have lost your reason oy appearing grateful. NEWS OF THE WEEK.

LOCAL SUMMARY. The J. K. Hudson property at Ninth Avoid - SR. JOHN W. BULL. The Discoverer of the Famous Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup. Dr. John W. Bull, who discovered DR. BULL'S COUGH SYRUP 50 years ago, was the most successful doctor of throat and lung diseases the world has ever known. He had a national repu tation on account of the wonderful cures he made in cases of chronic throat trouble and so-called incurable con sumption. Dr. Bull discovered the formula which he used so successfully for many years after long practice and untiring scientific study. It has ever since been known as DR. BULL'S COUGH SYRUP. No other doctor or chemist has ever been able to com pound any preparation containing the curative qualities of DR. BULL'S COUGH SYRUP. No other formula has ever been discovered that so effectively cures all diseases of the throat and lungs as DR. BULL'S COUGH SYRUP. There is no case of hoarseness, cough, catarrh, asthma, bronchitis, quinsy, whooping cough, croup, measles' cough, grip or consumption that cannot be cured speedily by the proper use of DR. BULL'S COUGH SYRUP. Thousands of letters have been received from grateful people who were cured by it. It has been a household remedy for the past 60 years, and there is scarcely a home or a cabin in the United States or Canada that has not a bottle of this wonderful cure in the medicine closet. It contains no injurious drugs. It heals the throat and lungs and renders them perfectly healthy.' It leaves no bad af ter effects. and Tyler streets Is purchased by Armln Fassler, of the Inter-Ocean mills.

The Farmers' Co-operattlve Grain and Live Stock association, which is the state organization formed last spring to fight the grain trust, is preparing to branch out. The directors of the asso ciation have been in session here for the past two days, concluding their ses sion this morning, and have 'concluded to call a meeting of the stockholders as soon as practicable, probably in March, to decide upon several important mat ters. The meeting will be held at some point in the wheat belt that will be easy of access for Oklahoma as well as the Kansas wheat belt. One of the important matters to come up is the question of admitting Oklahoma local co-operative shipping associations in the Kansas state association. The in terests of the two states are practically the same, and the Oklahoma grain growers are asking to be admitted to the Kansas organization. For this rea son the meeting will be at some point where the Oklahoma delegates can get to it easily, which will be determined later by Secretary James Butler. It will quite likely be at either Hutchin son or McPherson. Another matter which the directors are considering is the question of ex porting wheat direct to Europe. This is already done by the local association at Solomon .as told by the State Jour nal a few days ago. It is probable that the state association may do something of the same kind. The Kansas association is growing rapidly. It is doing a sufficient busi ness to pay all expenses and leave a profit besides for the stockholders. Dur ing the month of November it handled 78,000 bushels of wheat, and wheat was not moving to any extent either. It sells all of best wheat direct to west ern mills, and ships only the poorer grades to Kansas City. "It Is remarkable how much wheat is being fed in the place of corn," remark ed J. A. Bucklin, of Oakley, psesident of the association, today. "It is esti Substitutes I

PHILADELPHIA, Pa, Sept. 11, 1901. Gentlemen In my work as a mono logist, singer and entertainer, I fre quently find the strain on my throat so exhausting as to practically make it impossible for me to continue without using a remedy. A long lecture often leaves me with a very sore and hoarse throat, and at such times I find DR. BULL'S COUGH SYRUP invaluable as a soother and voice strengthener. So much do I think of this remedy that I am never at home without a bottle of it, and on my tours through the coun try I never fail to include DR. BULL'S COUGH SYRUP in my grip In fact, it is as essential to my success as are my songs, stories or violin. Very truly yours, RALPH BINGHAM. DOCTORS PRESCRIBE DR.

It is being fed far more extensively than is commonly supposed. That is one reason why the receipts of wheat in Kansas City are so small. The receipts were only 29 cars yesterday, which Is not enough to run the mills of Kansas City alone let alone leaving any for export or other mills. It would look as though the mills will have to pay a premium for the best wheat before very long." AN ESCAPED GORILLA. Big Brute Loose From a Circus In Maryland. Ridgely, Md., Dec 7. On September 28 a huge., gorilla escaped from the Charles Lees circus at Seaford, Del., and has terrorized the residents in that section and along the eastern shore of Maryland. Frank Biles, colored, was nearly killed Tuesday night by the gorilla near Bethel Camp Ground, Del. Biles was riding a wheel when he was attacked. The animal threw him from the wheel and dealt him a heavy blow with its fist. He pulled a revolver, shot twice and escaped to Cannons. His clothing was in shreds and there was an ugiy wound over his ear. John Dyer said last night that he saw a strange looking animal, his de scription of which corresponds with that of the gorilla, on the edge of a "cripple," as a tree-grown marsh is called in this locality, on the west side of the Great Choptank river. Dyer says that he first saw the an imal about 11 in the morning, and it fled into the "cripple." He claims to have seen it again about 4 in the after noon. Dyer was visited today by Ru dolph Cephus, of Denton, a mighty hunter of these parts. Cephus was oil a ducking expedition, armed with a heavy ducking gun, and he tried to trace the gorilla in the hope of getting a shot at it, but failed. An effort is being made to gather a party to go In search of the gorilla and to thoroughly scour the "cripples" along the Choptank. The excitement among the negroes is intense, and they have kept closely at home at night. SHE
