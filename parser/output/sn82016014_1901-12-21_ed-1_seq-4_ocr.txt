The -western part of the state seems to be especially adapted for the growth of sugar beets. The experiments made this year by the farmers of Hamilton, Kearny and Finney counties indicate this, and there will doubtless be a much larger acreage grown this year. Miss Gertrude Coburn, whom Secre tary Coburn, of the state department of agriculture, sent to these southwest ern counties as his representative to ascertain the amount of sugar beets on which the state should pay a bounty, has just returned from her trip, and makes a very interesting report. The last legislature passed a law providing that a bounty of one dollar a ton should be paid to Kansas farmers for all beets used for the manufacture of sugar which yielded twelve per cent sugar It provided that the secretary of the state board of agriculture should Investigate the claims filed for bounty, but it failed to make an appropriation for the investigation, and Secretary Coburn therefore sent his daughter. Miss Gertrude Coburn, to make the In vestigation. In making her report today Miss Co burn explained that the sugar company was late in making contracts and giv ing the farmers instructions in raising sugar beets last year, so that the ground was not properly prepared. The best curat- hoots irrow entirely under ground and are tapering, reaching to a considerable aepin. io kuuii. : results the ground should be ployed and pulverized to a considerable depth. Then the ground must be leveled and Pitched for irrigation, and It required more time to properly prepare all thesa jn) adway's M Pills nf nil disorders of the stom nch liver, bowels, kidneys, bladder, ner .

One Good Man Better Than Half Dozen Poor Ones. liecords of the Collectors During the Past Year. One of the chief boasts of Mayor Hughes' administration has been the ereat saving i n the cost of collecting dog tax under the plan followed by him. The final report of dog tax collecting for the year 3901 shows that under Mayor Hughes' plan it cost 37.5 cents to collect for each one of the 1,829 licenses issued, while for the year 1900 the cost license was 35.9 cents. Mayor Hughes' plan was to aiviuc w work up among six different men, in order to satisfy as many patriots who had worked for him in the campaign as possible. Formerly it has been the custom to allow one man to collect the doe tax. The pay for dog tax coi loftnr under oithar svstem was au a mnnth rTndor the TT-.ihes svstem. It cost $687 to collect 1,829 licenses, which, represent- ui u Mil incaftip af Xz.Oza. TTnder the old svstem. It cost diu ro eolloot S62 licenses, representing a casn income of $986. The figures are for the voara 1901 anrt 1S0O reSDeCtlVelV. The Hughes collectors were lucky In finding more female dogs to collect tax on than was th collector appointea oy Mavor Drew.

It cost 35.4 cents to collect each dollar under Mayor Drew, and 33.9 to i-r,llf t w.h dollar under Mavor Hughes. If all the Hughes collectors had made as good a record as did M. K. Tounkin, the present engineer at tne city duiiu ing, the record of the whole would be much better than It Is.

Be- tv,,tar,.. thB intense cold this week. sides. Mr. Younkin killed, during tne four months which he worked. 125 re- male dogs and 85 male dogs which had no owners willing to put up the price of a license. Nels McConnell. who was at work for four months In 1901, two months under Mayor Hughes, also made a good show Iner. The following show the amounts turned In by various collectors for the war 1901: Nels McConnell, 4 months $ 491.00 M. E. Tounkin, 4 months 621.00 Marion Sheldon, 1 months.... 289.00 J. B. Jones, 2 months 240.00 J. H. Ream, 1 month 136.00 Ed Stoner, 1 month 132.00 J. H. Weed, one week 9.00 Office collections 107.00 Total collected for 1901 $2,025.00 During the year the various dog tax collectors have killed 808 stray dogs, which could not find a friend to pay thA license. . The Husrhes experiment has conclus ively demonstrated one or two things which will be of value. It has proven that one good man collecting dog tax would be better than half a dozen poor ones. It has shown that there have in nast vears been hundreds of dogs In ToDeka which escaped paying the tax. The one-man system is the most eco nomical method of collection, proviaea the right man can be given the Job. Ap parently the right man has so far never had the job. Mayor Hughes' collectors turned into the city treasury a net revenue of J1.33S. In 1900 the collector turned into the treasury a net revenue of $636. The in crease in revenue under Mayor Hughes has-been at the expense of economy, and if next year the two can be com bined, the net revenue to the city ought to reach about $1,600 from the one item of dog licenses.

The trips were made by stage, and there were three others in the governor's party. "We might have suffered severely from the cold." said the governor to day "but the wind was in our backs most of the way. and the curtains on the stage kept most of it out. Croing from Hugoton to Liberal we drove east and had the wind in the north, so that was a little more unpleasant, but I have taken many worse trips than that years ago when I first settled in Wichita and we had to drive to all the surrounding county seats to attend court.
