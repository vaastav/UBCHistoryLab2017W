I SENATOR WORKS TALKS OF MOBALS IN DISTRICT Thinks the President Should Broach Subject in His Next Message to Congress. Senator Works of California thinks that President Taft's "District" message, to he written some time after the Christmas holidays, ought to contain material touching upon moral conditions. The District Commissioners, in their estimates to Congress, have failed, says Senator Works, "to pay any attention to the moral needs." He thinks the President should make up for this supposed deficiency. Mr. Works especially complains about the large number of saloons in certain squares and the presence of undesirable people in a certain section near the Capitol. As to the saloons he thinks that their number should be limited throughout the city. In an interview Senator Works said that it was notorious that many fittest ionable resorts arc now within a stone's throw of the Capitol, lie had not Investigated tlie question, but as a member of the District committee of the Senate he Intended to do so. Senator Works said that it was right that the District Commissioners should call attention to the financial needs of the District, hut they should not Ignore moral conditions. , Senator Works was at the White House today to Introduce A T.

POLICEMEN GETBUSY, I ' Sand and Gravel Company Alleged to Have Violated ; District Law. i __________ 1 An old feud between the police and the < Benntng Sand and Gravel Company took a turn in favor of the corporation early this morning, when the police awoke to i And a brand-new steel bridge thrown i a'Toss the roadway of Minnesota avenue, 1 connecting the gravel plant with the Baltimore and Ohio freight yards. As a consequence two warrants have been issued for the arrest of officials, the charge being that they violated the District's building regulations. Several years ago the police stopped the company from building a bridge across the road, although the company's attorneys believed the police were exceeding their authority. Police on the Alert. Policemen have been keeping their eyes on the company's movements ever since that time, but last night the construction engineers stole a march on them, and between the dark hours of 2 o'clock and 5 o'clock a.m. a great big skeleton of a bridge, with a dozen girders of three tops weight apiece, was placed right where the police said it shouldn't go. As soon as No. 0 precinct heard about it very nearly all the men on the place who weren't on duty were chased over to Minnesota avenue in a hurry. They were considerably chagrined over the way the sand and gravel people had beaten them and. according to officials of the company. nearly every man on the entire premises, covering 116 acres, was threatened with arrest. Company Officials Elated. Meantime the officials of the company are somewhat elated, and are chuckling privately among themselves. Thev hold that the erection of a bridge there does not violate the building: regulations of the Qistrict, and are willing to try out the case in court. The police told Qua A. Schuldt, assistant corporation counsel, that the company had erected a steel bridge connecting the plant with the B. and O. freight yards in violation of their strict injunctions. The bridge is designed to facilitate the loading of freight cars. HWWlBUlE TO CHARLES F. WILSON Private Secretary to Mr. Knox Guest at Banquet?To Practice Law. Charles F.

Paying the Agents. The records, it is claimed, will show that the secretary of tlie iron workers paid some of these men direct at his office in this city; that he used money J g 1 1 x t A. -.Ml oruers lor paying umerg, ami mat sun others were paid through u trusted agent who held office in a labor organization. This man is the one who acted for llcNamara with McManigai until It was learned that the agent was keeping part of the money to which McManigai was entitled, and MoNamara took upon himself the payments. The federal authorities believe they will be able to prove that the work of destruction was systematized; that a certain amount was paid for certain results, and a smaller amount where the effort was made and very little or no destruction was accomplished. There is reason to believe that James MoNamara got $750 for the Los Angeles Times job, the highest ever paid for a single explosion. A report is current that McNamara also utilized express money orders in the payment of dynamiters, and thut on one occasion at least he sent money by telegraph to one of them. The government is preparing to investigate these rumors. RYAN IN INDIANAPOLIS. Iron Workers' President Complains of Being Misrepresented. INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., December !i.? Prank M.

COMMISSIONERS IN DOUBT I District Heads Have Reached No Conclusive on the Universal Transfer Measure. Tlie suggestion that excise matters in the District bo brought under the .jurisdiction and control of a board consisting of the two judges of the Police Court mid the judge of tlie Juvenile Court is by no means assured of meeting with the support of the District Commissioners. While the suggestion originated with them, and is being incorporated In a bill that is now being prepared by Corporation Counsel Thomas, there is a probability, it was learned today, of the provision meeting with opposition from one or more of the Commissioners. At all events, it is stated, this feature is the one that will , IIgiven most consideration, and practically is the only one concerning which ! any differences of opinion are apt to ; arise. I Unanimous on One Point. Whatever decision is reached finally, the "Commissioners, it was announced today, are unanimously in favor of divorci ing excise matters from (lie duties of the ! members of the board of assistant asi sessors. and will endeavor to have the bill I providing for the transfer whipped into j shape and ready for transmission to ConJ gre&s within a week or two. ! Sin e the suggestion was made concernj ing the placing of excise matters with the < | judges of the Police and Juvenile Courts numerous protests against the plan have been received by the Commissioners from citizens and civic bodies. The most recent protest was troin the Cnited tierman Societies, which passed a resolution directing that a board of three business men. who are in no way connected with the District or federal governments, be created as an excise board. Alleged Defects in Plan. Corporation Counsel Thomas has not indicated whether, in his opinion, it would be legal to confer administrative powers upon officials of the government who are charged with judicial functions. It has been urged in several of the protests that the plan is defective, in that the judges, who frequently are required to pass on eases growing out of violation of the liquor laws, would have prior knowledge of conditions which might render impossible their giving unbiased decisions with respect to liquor license applications. From an economic standpoint the plan is said to be favored by the Commissioners. While increases in the salaries of mo judges would be provided for. it is claimed that the cost of administering excise functions, under the proposed arrangement, would be less than if a board, consisting of members not connected with eitlser the local or national governments, were created. No Decision on Transfers. The Commissioners, it was announced today, have not yet reached a conclusion concerning whether they will support the universal transfer hill proposed toy the citizens' conference committee, or their own measure, which was introduced in Congress last session as a substitute for the universal transfer bill introduced by Senator Works of California. Corporation Counsel Thomas is to make a report on this matter, and the Commissioners, it is said, will endeavor to reach an early conclusion. As yet the stenographic report of the recent hearing given by the Commissioners on the new water rates, which are to go into effect July 1 next, has not been received by the District heads, f'ommis- , sioner Rudolph today said that as soon as the report is finished the Commissioners will go carefully over the argument presented. There is believed to be little or no probability of the order being revoked or amended. SAYS WIFE IS NOT DEAD. Brooklyn Man Defuses to Accept Judgment of Physicians.
