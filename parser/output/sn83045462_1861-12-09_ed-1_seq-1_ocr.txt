Secretary Smith says that the report of the operations of this Department daring the fis2*1 7*** ?<iing J0ne 30,1861, will exhibit n diminished amount of business in some of the most important bureaus connected with the Department, attributable mainly to the insurrection which has suddenly precipitated the country into a civil war. cb**ral laud omcfc. The decline of business has very sensibly affected the operations of the General Land Office. Offici^intercourse has been entirely suspended with all the Southern States which contain any portion of the public lands, and consequently no sales have been made in any of those States. In all the Northern States in which any of the public lands are situated the war has almost entirely suspended sales The demand for volunteers has called into the ranks of the army a large number of that portion of our people whose energy and enterprise in time of peace incline them tt> emigrate to the West fcnd Settle upon the public lands, thus lying the foundations of future prosperous communities and States Besides, the ordinary channels of traae and commerce hare been so obstructed br the war that the sources of income from which the settlers upon the public lands have realized the means of purchasing hare been greatly diminishedOn the 30th September, 18(11, there were 55,555,595.2j acres of the public lands which had been surveyed but not proclaimed for public sale. The lands surreyed and offered At public sale prerictis to that time, and than subject to prirate entry, amounted to 78.662,735.64 acres, making an aggregate of publio lands surreyed and ready for saie of 134,218,330 89 acres. Since the last annual report ef this Department no proclamation for a public sale of lands has been made, as the quantity already subject to private entry is more than sufficient to meet the wants of the country. During the fiscal year ending 30;h June, 1861, and the first quarter of the current year, ending 30th September, 1361, 5.289.532.31 acres have been disposed of. Of this amount, 1.021,493.77 acres have been certified to the States of Minnesota, Michigan and Louisiana under railroad grants made br Congress; 606 094 47 acres hare been certified to States as swamp landr; 2 153,040 acres have been located with bounty land warrants, and 1.508,004 07 acres have been sold for cash, producing $925.299.42. It will be seen from this statement that the public lands have ceased substantially, for the present at least, to be a source of revenue to the Government. The liberal manner in which the aets of Congress granting swamp and overflowed lands to the States have been construed and executed, the grants ef large quantities to aid in the construction of railroads, and the quantity required to locate bounty land warrants for military servioea, hare combined to reduce the cash sales to an amount hut little more than sufficient to meet the expenses of our land system. The net income from sales during the last fical year will hardly reach the sum of $200,000. The propriety of issuing bounty land warrants to the volunteers who have been called into service to suppress the existing insurrection is already a subject of discussion, and must b? determined by Congress. A warrant for lrto acres to each volunteer engaged in the service would absorb over one nunared minions of a.'re?? much larger amount than has been issued under all previous laws. It is evident that the issue of such an amount of warrants would destroy all hope of deriving any revenue from the publij lands, at least for many years. And, while such a measure would deprive the Government of all income from this source, it would afford but little benefit to the volunteers. These warrants are now sold in the market at about fifty cents per acre. An addition of tae large amount necessary to supply the volunteers would necessarily reduce the price of them to a merely nominal sum. The bounty of the Government, dispensed to the rolunteers in this form, would fail to realise to them the adrantegea intended. All the best lands would fall into the hends of apeculators,who would be enabled to purchase them at a nominal price, and sell them to settlers at full prices a* fast as emigration to the West would require them for settlement. If additional compensation to the rolunteers, beyond the amount now authorized by law, shall be deemed just and proper, it will be better both for the Government and the rolunteers to compensation bj a direct appropriation of money, or of Government securities This would give them the full benefit of the appropriations made, while the Government would, by keeping the lands until they shall be demanded for settlement, realise their full ralue. 

IXDIA!! AFFAIRS. Our Indian affairs are in a rery unsettled and unsatisfaetory oondition. The spirit of rebellion against the authority of the Government, which has precipitated a large number of States into open revolt, has been instilled into a portion of the Indian ^ribes by emissaries from the insurrectionary The large tribes of Cherokee*. Chickasaws and Choc laws, situated in the southern superintendency, hare suspended all intercourse with the agents of the United States. The superintendent and agents appointed since the 4th of March last hare been unable to reach their poets or to hold any intercourse with the tribes under their charge. The superintendent and some, if not all, of the agents of the southern superintendence who were in office on the 4ih of March, hare assumed an attitude of revolt to the United States, and have instigated the Indians to acta of hostility Some of these, whe lately held their offices under the United Statea, new claim to exercise the same authority by rirtue of commissions from the pretended Southern Gorernment. Although the Indian Offioe baa not been able to procure definite information of the oondition of affairs, and of the extent to which the Indians hare assumed a hostile attitude, enough haa been ascertained to leare no room for doubt that the influencea which hare been exerted upon the Indians hare been aufficient to induce a portion of them to renounce the authority of the United States and to acknowledge that of the rebel gorernment. It haa been currentlr reported, through the press, that a portion of them hare been organized as a military force, and are in arms with the rebels; but the Department has no official information confirming these rumors. The hostile attitude assumed by portions of the tribes referred to haa sesulted from their fears, produced by riolence and threats of emissaries sent among them, and the withdrawal frcm their vicinity of the'troopa of tho United States, whose presence would hare aff rded a guarantee of protection. It is unfortunate that the War Department has been unable to aend to that region suoh a body of tr jopa as would be adequate to the protection of tnoee tribes and rerire their oonfidence in th? ability aa well as the will of the United S:atee to comply with their treaty stipulations. Cat off from all intercourse with loyal citisens; surrounded bv emissaries from the rebels who represented that the Gorernment of the United Sates was destroyed, and who promised that the rebel government would assume the obligations of the United States and pay their annuities; aasailed by threats of violenoe, and eeeing around them no evidenee of the power of the United States to proteet then, it is not surprising that their loyalty was unable to resist sueh lnflaenees. Many white men of far Elater intelligence have joined the insurreonists against their own convictions of right under much less pressure We heve reason to believe that as soon as the United Strtes shall re-establish their authority in the Indian country, and shall send there a sufficient foree fer (he protection of the j tribes, they will renounce all connection with toe rebel government and resume their former M / ikitttig S tar.

The payment of their annuities has been suspended The tribes upon the Pacific slope of the Kocky Mountains have manifested a turbulent spirit, but have committed no acts of violence. With vigilance on the part of the agents it is hoped they may be restrained from depredations upon the white settlers, and be gradually brought under the control of the laws of the United States. Mtich trouble haa been experienced in New Mexico from depredations committed by some of the tribes in that Territory The withdrawal of the troops of the United States has encouraged them to acts of violence, while the active interference of disloyal persons from Texas has induced them to disregard the laws and authority of the Government. The presence of a military force in that Territory i? indispensable to preserve the peace and cause the Indians to respect the laws. patent office. No branch of the public service connected with this Department has been so much affected by the insurrection of the Southern Mates as that of the Patent Office. The receipts of the office from January 1st to September .10th, 1861, were $102 806. IS' and the expenditures were $185,594 05, showing an excess of expenditures over receipts of $32,79o 87. r During the corresponding period of the last I"' ihl receipt! were $197,348.40. being $94,840 -2 more than the receipts for the same part of this year. During the same period 3,514 applications for patents and 519 caveats have been filed, 2 581 patents have been issued, and 15 patents hare been extended. To meet this deficiency in the income of the office the Commissioner, with the consdrrence of the Department, has reduced the clerical force by the discharge of thirty of the employees, and reduced the grade of the remainder in order to lessen their compensation By this reduction it is believed by the Commissioner that the expenditures will be brought within the receipts. I pension office. The casualties of the conflict in which the Government is now engaged will increase the list of pensioners very largely. The amount of increase cannot be estimated, as it will I depend upon the duration of the war. The I large amount of business which will necessarily be thrown upon the office from this cause will render an increase of the clerical force em- I ployed indispensable. The Commissioner of Pensions, with the concurrence of the Department, has construed the pension laws now in forco as authorising the granting of pensiens to invalids and the Jj ren ?f d<*0"?d soldiers who have been killed or wounded In the existing insurrection. If this construction of the laws I should be deemed improper the corrective is I with Congress. whn Tn MC,ertai1ned that many of those n P'80?*1 uP<>n the pension rolls JLm. iln!U?rr?ktl0Dtry ?tate3 haTe attached themselves to the rebel cause, and have taken I Smfth1!? the Government. Secretary I Smith deemed it his duty in all such cases to direct a suspension of the payment of the pensions awarded to them. lie has also directed I a suspension of payment to all pensioners in any of the States who haVe iu any manner encouraged the rebels, or manifested a sympa- I thy with their cause. v I ' r. africa* slave trade It .o to know that nopr???4#nt?<l I success Its crowned the efforts of the past few S2dl F?r. 8QPPr?fion of the African slave InH LJ ve*seia have been seized, tried, and condemned by the courts.
