Contracts Carry Possible Produc tions Far Into the New Year. ACTUAL DEMAND THE CAUSE. New York, Dee. 11. The approach of a new year usually brings ho much of hesitation In business that the small shrinkage this year is surprising. Probably never before have the pro ductive forces of the country been so largely covered by contracts at this date insuring employment and profit far into the coming year. This result.), not from any mere speculative excite ment but from actual demands for con sumption running far beyond the pro ducing capacity heretofore arid push ing it to remarkable expansion. The increase in foreign trade has been in significant compared with the increaso of S'J4,00(),0(tO,())0 in payments through clearing houses. For the week the pay ments have been -'). 3 per cent larger than last year and 3S. 1 per cent larger than in 18112. Hides are again stronger at Chicago, although receipts of cattle at the four chief western markets in eleven months have been 3 per cent larger than in the previous year as the demand for con sumption in manufacture has evidently increased much more. Thus western production of hoots and shoes has gain ed more than east-rn, yet shipments from lloston for t tic year have been 373,000 cases. The demand for cot ton goods is heavy and covers production far ahead in many lines, while fears of important strikes have been dispelled by a gen eral advance in wages. The strength of wool is apparently unimpaired, though demand is quieter. IiOndon prices have again moved high er and the small available supply of fine grades supports the belief that prices still move upward. tieori;e V. Martin Named. Topeka, Pec. 0.

General Wood is certainly the popu lar choice, both in the United' States and in Cuba, for the position named and if he is made governor of Cuba he will continue to give the Cubans as large a measure of self-government un der the military administration as they are able to control, increasing their au thority as they grow accustomed to ex ercising the functions of administer ing their own affairs, so that when the municipal elections are held after April 11, next, the Cubans elected to office will have had experience to con duct their affairs.
