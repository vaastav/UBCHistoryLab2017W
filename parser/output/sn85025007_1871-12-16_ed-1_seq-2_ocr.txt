, gf_ ALEXANDRIA, VA. j SATURDAY, DECEMBER 10. The Radical Senators held a caucus yesterday on Mr. Trumbull's resolution, now pending in the Senate. The result was that they at last, agreed to support it, with an amendment omitting that part instructing the Committee on Investigation and Retrenchment to consider the expediency of so amending the laws under which appointments to the public service are now made, as to provide for withdrawing the public service from being used asan instrument of political or party patronage. The resolution, as tRus amended, instructs the committee to inquire into the expenditures of all branches of the service of the U. S., and report auy and what offices ought to be abolished, whether any and what salaries or allowances ought, to be reduced, what are the methods in procuring accountability in public-agents or officers in the care and disbursement of public moneys, whether the moneys have beeu paid out illegally, whether any officers or agents or other persons have been or are employed in the public service without authority of law or unnecessarily, and generally how and to what extent the expenses of the service of the country may and ought to he curtailed. The caucus theu agreed on the following named Senators to compose the committee Messrs. Buckingham, llowe, Pratt, Harlan, Stewart, Pool and Bayard, the last named the only Democrat on the committee. The caucus carefully excluded from the committee those who had taken part in the debate on retrenchment, and Messrs. Trumbull and Schurz have no place on it. The Washington Chronicle says that there has beeu paid out of the U. S. Treasury, the sum of $38,000,000, to indemuify States for money advanced in equipping troops during the late war. There are claims ol this charac ? 1 11- .1 . O ter- which have been suspeDaea oy uic occretary of the Treasury amounting to ?4,300,U00, uo uioney being available for the purpose of meeting the paymeut, the law authoring the Secretary of the Treasury to use tuouey for this purpose iu the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, having been repealed iu lST'J. Senator Wright's bill, appropriating ?2,000,000 to discharge these suspended claims, is out million less thau the sum required fur this purnose, as estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury. 3Ir. Williams, the new U. S. Attorney General, in reply to an address of his friends from the Far West, who are now in Washington, said l'his best energies would be devoted to an enforcement of the laws and the suppression of violence; that he felt a pride in the development of the Far West now represented in every branch of the Government; that he had a profound couviction in the ascendency of the Republican party for many years yet, and should earnestly labor to secure its future triumphs." Of course he will,otherwise he would never have been appointed Attorney General. In the contested-election case of Bowen vs. Be Large, of South Carolina, De Large, who now occupies the seat in Congress, has failed to put in any rebutting evidence against the testimony put in by Bowen. Additional testi niony from the confession of one of the commissioners of clcctiou seems to have satisfied BeLarge that he cannot make a successful contest, -1 * fx t- La TT?tll molr A nA 4\ i HIIU 11 IS suppuscu Uiai. lie n ill Ultivt uvr mini er effort. Bowen is the bigamy man. The N\ Y. Times now declares war against Messrs. Charles 0'Conor, Samuel J. Tildeu, William F. Havemeyer, Daniel F. Tiemann, John J. Cisco, and their fellow-Democrats,who recently brought about the victory of reform in New York. It says: 'Tudeed, Mr. Andrew il. Green is the only one of the'Democratic reformers' in whose permanent fidelity to hi* trusts we are disposed to place a grain of confidence." So it goes. Although the apportionment bill just passed the House of Representative, provides that a Territory to be admitted as a State into the Union, must have a population of 137,000, the friends of the bills admitting the Territories of Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah have not ceased their effort* to bring about their passage. The House of Representatives passed a bill ou Tuesday requiring the owners of lands in the South, sold for Federal taxes who may recover them in court, to pay all taxes, costs, &c. It also provides that the persons who bought them may draw back from the treasury the ? .?.? ?:.i amuuui lilt*) jjciiu iui oaiu laiius. There ft doubt as to whether au amnesty bill can be passed before Congress takes its recess on Thursday nest, though several Southern republican members, with many Northern oues, united with the democratic vote, will make an effort to inaugurate the new year with a universal amnesty law. There is apprehension iu some quarters that trouble may arise from the recent personal assault of the Kussian Czaroyitch on the German Prince de Keuss. It was certainly a strange affair. Gen. Sherman aud Lieut. Graut have arrived at Cadiz. The Grand Duke Alexis is in Canada, lie is expected to go to St. Louis about the 2t*th. He has beeu iuvited by Gen. Sheridan to a buffalo hunt on the plaius. Complaint is made in Baltimore of the high ] n ice of oysters.

The testimony showed that ^ Jim Williams, the colored eaptaiu of militia, | had threatened to slay the whites from the cradle up. and to apply the torch. Win. IIrat- . ton, colored, testified that he was lieutenant in i Williams's company, "and was reduced to the ranks oft account of his dissent from Williams's violent measu-es. The defence asked further time to bring witnesses to show that the Ku ( Klux was organized for sell-protect ion. and had i ceased to exist of itself. In reply to a remark by Mr. .Morton, of Indi- '< ana. in the debate iu the Senate on the proposed investigation into frauds and abuses, that i ''the movement was fur the purpose of hurting the Republican party," Mr. Schurz promptly said, either the party is not what it pretends to be. a party of reform, or the party should, iustoud of repelling the denunciation of abuses, rather encourage that spirit which .shou'd prompt its members fearlessly and without lies- \ itutiou, whenever they find a wrong in this Gov- j eminent, to disclose it before the eyes of the ' country. The Southern Claims Commission report that the whole number of claims presented up to the end of November is 10,000, aud the entire amount $20.500,000.

Iu the trial of Mrs. Wharton at Annapolis yesterday, the Court decided that the evidence of Mr. Van Ncs$, as offered by the State, was not admissible. Chas. L Ketohum, the e 1 de?t i son of the late Gen. Ketchuiu, was then examined, and testitied as to his conversations with Mrs. Wharton about the $4,000 in Government bonds,and her note giveu to the General for $2,000. During his examination the counsel for the State offered iu evidence the i books of Gen. K.. containing his entries as to this indebtedness of the^>risuuer, but objection was made to their being admitted. A report from Helena, Arkansas, says a murder was committed in Lake Village, Chicot county, on Monday last.by two white -men, who killed G. W. Wynn, a colored lawyer, who re cenrly located there. The killing grew out of a political difference in the late election in that county. Intense excitement prevails and hundreds of armed men are pouring into the town. It is feared the murderers will be taken from jail aud lynched. \\ Un.vlinfp I W A lonriniti I ot t AAlinotl JL ?* lig^HIJ^ \ IT UOL V 1 I I Ilia/ W'UUlll on the 14th iust. passed an oidinance exempt ins; the property of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in that city. from future taxation, upon the condition that the compam shall build repair and workshops there, to cost upwards of ?100.000.

Boston, who was iu 1SG9, with other persons, convicted of fraud against the Government and sentenced to live years' imprisonment and a line of $100,000.has been pardoned by the President and the hue remitted. The tobacco manufacturers are urging upon Congress the necessity of some definite action iu relation to the tax. The present agitation upou the subject is very disastrous to their interests. The New York Times of yesterday, says:? We regret to hear from Washington that Mr. Calleuder, the bank examinerrfor this district, has been suffered to resign, in place of bciDg summarily dismissed." One of the marked features of the provision trade this season, is the very large increase in the exports, the low prices prevailing inducing UDiisually large purchases lor foreign accouDt.

She was a simple country girl, and not having the advantages of an education and many of the chances for enlightenment, at an evil hour she lull a victim to the deceiver, and was deserted by him. When scarcely over eighteen years of age she left her home clandestinely and went to Alexandria, where her haudsome face attracted to her many "admirers. Here she lived until about eight years ago, when she took up her. residence in Raltimore, and finally opened the bagnio in .Josephine street.

The consequence was that Judge Shuuiaker was sent here to look into the matter,, and after a thorough iuvestigatiou decided to have Mr. Almond reinstated.

VuttiiNiA.?The men aud journals that say hat \ irgmiu s state is worse in '71 than in 7<l. worse in 7u than in lilt, take their fancies or facts, and resort not to observation of wide nous hut to isolated instances for their illustraious. Xo definite statistics arc attainable on :lie subject, but any one who lias seen with his nvu eye> different portions of the State, and >vho has combined information from various piartets, knows that the country is really reMVcrinu in a substantial mauncr from the pov;rty left by the war. Take the prices of :orn aud meat for a guide, aud we find that lie country is full to repletion of those staples ; ake the tobacco crop, the cotton, and the peaiuts of the iSouthside, aud we fiud abundant imps, at renuuierative prices; take the Valley md Piedmont, aud we fiud houses and barns cbuilt, fencing restored, fields again clothed with grass, live stock ahuudatit and general :hrift aud abundance where five years ago au >peu country and a teuautless expanse seemed aopeless of a future. Nodi; deny that the evils of the war aud of j :he violent change in our social condition stiil j ie heavy up u us. But we are bearing up | igainst them; we are slowly but surely oversowing them, aud we need but to let alone the J jatural effect of labor and economy to see the ;ouutry return to and overpass its former stanlard of wealth. J)estrov the credit of the State ind the credit of all its citizens dies with it. i'hert. indeed, will be a death beyond the hope jf a resurrection. 1'trrsbnrr/ huhx. 

('U-MUKULAND Coai. Trapk.?'The early appearance of wintry weather has had the effect >f arresting shipments by the canal before the :ime fixed by the Board ol Directors for stopping operations for the season. Ice has proved iroublesoim: for the past ten days, but by the xid of ice breakers it is expected to keep the hannel open sufficiently to enable boats caught xlong the line to get into their winter harbors icfore drawing off the water. The shipments of ;oaI from Cumberland for the season largely ex;eed those of any previous year. There were U7,97."> tons aud I'J cwt. shipped, whilst last rear the aggregate was b')t>,7u7.19?showing an oerease for the present year of 1241.Ut>t? tou.s.? Cumbirlrind Alfeyttiiiun. J>resident Clarke has direeted that all loaded joats arriving at Georgetown be unloaded as <oou as possible in order that they may go into .vinter quarters up the canal before the 2<>th ust. About twenty boats will tie up for the tea son near the collector's office. Unhappy Affair?A letter in the Piedmont (Orange Co.) Virginiau, dated Barboursrille. Dec. 11, says:?ilrfoon after the war a man moved 'from an adjoining county to this ! leighborhood, and in a short time married a vidow. Botli had children before this mar- 1 iage?he daughters and she sons. Happiness prevailed in the family until a short time ago, vlien one 01 nis daughters was tounu prostrate md suffering acute paiu. On inquiry as to the :ause, .she confessed to her father that she had aken arsenic to destroy her life, and thereby :ancel her shame. Fortunately for heT she oolc so much of the poison?about 30 grainshat it was thrown from the stomach in an tour, hut remained long enough to produce institutional effects from which she narrowly soaped with her life. It seems she had fallen lesperutely iu love with one of her step-brothirs and expected to marry him; hut he deceivd her and fled to unknown parts, as soon as lis villainy was discovered." The Radicals in the Senate having found out hat in attempting to suppress investigation ino government abuses and frauds, they made a iilse move, have partially succumbed? but will ake care to have a committee to suit themelves ! Their leaders, it is admitted, are not tatcsmen, and their action on Mr. Trumbull's esolution, so far, has shown they are not even, stute politicians. The X: V. Tribune "shocked at the late acr iou in the Senate on Mr. Trumbull's "investiation resolution," appeals to the President o lose no time in relieving himself rum the fatally false position in which, whether mistakenly or wilfully, his special riends have placed, no.t only himself, but a reat party." The X. V. Ileraid has a "sensational revelation a a Spanish intrigue at Geneva, by which the . Llabama arbitrament is to be frustrated." 'he Herald is so very sensational?that many f its reports and stories only excite a "sensaion" of a peculiar nature. The "International Parade" is to take place >niorrow in New York, without let or hinranee from the authorities. It is a very unecessary demonstration and only calculated to 1 ] o mischief. We hope, however, there will e no disturbances. The Mississippi Central railroad was protcs,'d yesterday on bonds due 1st of August last, 'he road ie leased to the Southern Railroad issociation, but both failed to provide necessap funds to avoid protest. One of the men arrested in the Indian Territory jr robbery of the Southern Express, jumped fiiu the steamer en route from Cairo to Union 1 ,'ity. Mo., yesterday, after shooting at and j lissing his custodian, whose pistol he had ?ized. and was drowned. SrOWN,
