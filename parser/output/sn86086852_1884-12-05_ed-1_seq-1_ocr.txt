Th republicaas dying prayer; “Don’l give the mugwumps any offi ces.” The N?w Yor.t Tribune tells the republican offi ;e holders that March 4th, nextyear, willbi wrilt’n “Mirch forth.” The Courier Journal says that had Blaine remained in Kentucky iustead of going t) Maine, he would have, doubtless, tiken a brigade of black horse cavalry into the confederate service, and would now be a rebel brigadier in congress. Thebe is no truth in the intima tion that Ci >v. Rusk will remove Col, Burchard from the state hoard of supervisors because of the unpopular ity of that gentleman’s name with re publican constituencies. Mississiiti has 108 254 white voters, as shown by the census. This jear Cleveland received only 78,457 votes. Acc- rding to Mr. Blaine’s logic, some 30,000 white votes* were inlh.iid.ited from voting for Cleveland. The Cherokeesof the Indian Nation are civilizing at a fast rate. They kavw passed a law excluding all white men from the na'ion. They don’t Wiiil any cheap .pauper labor in theirs. “The while man must go.” The Chicago Herald tells an ugly truth very plainly, thus: “The United States senate is a very disguit isg aggregation of monopolists, mo nopoly lawyers, cheap politicians and Mahone. The f.w wise asd good men cut no ll*ur in its councils.” The Evening Wisconsin rushed in, without knowing anything about the mutter, to critic’/, s the regents of the university for “gross mismanage ment” because there was so little in surance on the building and contents of Helen* e Hall.

Tint presid. Mil’s recommendation lliL thf) internal revenue taxes bo liken from boor and tobicc>, is one of the weak spots in a very sensi ble message.

THH SENAI om 1L PLUM Thu senatoral plum which is to drop from tin legislative tree this winter causes numerous rtpublcm mouths to w.sler; and there is a lively crowding just now to stand right under where it will fall.

Price thinks the tree could he shaken so as to make the plum fall on the bias, a litllu out of perpendicular, as it were, into his mouth. However, all this shouldering and shoving and month opening is in vain. At the proper time Senator Sawyer will take the long pole with a little bag on the end, which he uses m harvesting senatoral plums, and will tjnutly reach up, and that plum will detach itself from that tree and roll into that hag. He will then hand it to the man of bis choice and say “Here, John, try some of this fruit off from my tree.” All of Ibis is of no concern to the democrats. They have a little per Mtmnon harvest of their own on band and are measuring their poles with patriotic emulation to bo useful in their day anil generation. TO AIiMS, YE KNIGHTS: Gen.

In plain English, the secretary of the treasury of a re publican administration, right upon the heels of a high larifi - campaign, is declaring in his annual report, which is submitted with the sanction and approval of a republican presi dent, and virtually recommending as the policy of the government, sub stantially the same things that the hated tariff reformers are alvo i eating. He favors su?h tariff reduc tion on raw materials as will enable us to extend our foreign trade. He intimates that we must throw down our fences of protection H shows that our foreign trade is in a more critical condition than the public are generally aware, and that all that en ables us to meet the dram to pay for our imports from even the South American states is our agricultural products and petroleum. The secre tary outlines a policy which is but little variant from that of the tariff reformers of the democrats party. By his able and lucid exposition of the present state of our manufactures, and that they have bcou stimulated by a high tariff policy to over produc tion, the secretary makes utter non sense of nine-tenths of the tariff talk which was heard In Mr. Blaine's cam paign, during the last three months. He gives a quiet rebuff to Mr. Blaine's wild tariff ideas, ana leaves all the advocates of high tariff iu the attitude of mere pretenders iu the positions they assumed in the late canvass. VOL.

The President’s Message Washington, D. C., Dec. 1, 1884. To the Congress of the United State*:— Since the close of your last session the Ameri • can people in the exercise of their highest right ! of suffrage, have chosen their chief magistrate for the four years ensuing. When it is remem bered that at no period in the country’s history haa the lung political contest, which customarily precedes the day of the national election, been waged with greater fervor and intensity, it is a subje b of congratulation that after the controversy at the polls was over, and while the slight preponderance by which the issue had lieen determined was as yet unascertained the public peace suffered no disturbance, but the people everywhere patiently and quietly awaited the result. Nothing could more strikingly illustrate the temper of the American citizen; his love of order, and his loy alty to the law; nothing could more signally demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our political institutions. Eight years have elapsed since a controversy concerning the result of the national election sharply calh*d the attention of congress to the necessity of providing more pre cise and definite regulations for counting .the electoral vote. It is of the greatest importance that this ques tion be solved before conflicting claims to the presidency shall again distract the country, and I am persuaded that by the people at large any of the measures of relief thus far proposed would be preferred to continued inaction. ora 

REIATIONS WITH ALL FOREIGN POWERS continue to be amicable. With Belgium a con vention has been signed, whereby the scope of the present treaties have been so enlarged as to secure to citizens of either country' within the jurisdic tion of the other, equal rights and privileges in the acquisition and alienation of property A trade mark treaty has also been concluded. The war between Chili and Peru is at an end. For the arbitration of the claims of American citizens who during its continuance suffered through the acts of the Chilian authorities, a convention will soon be negotiated. Tiie state of hostility between France anti China continues to be an emharassing feature of our eastern relations. Tke Chinese government lias promptly adjusted and paid the claims of American citizens, whose property was destroyed in toe recent riots at Canton. I renew the recom mendation of my last annual message, that the Canton indemnity fund be returned to China The true interpretation of the recent treaty with that country permitting restriction of Chinese immigration is likely to again be the subject of your deliberations. It may be seriously question ed whether the statute passed at the last session, does not violate the treaty rights of certain Chinese who left this country with return certifi cates valid under trie old law, and now seem to be debarred from landing, from lack of certifi cates reqwired by the new. The recent purchases by tile United Stages of a large trading fleet, heretofore under the Chinese Mag. has considerably enhanced our commercial importance in the east. In view of the large number of vessels built or purchased by Ameri can citizens in other countries and exclusively employed in legitimate traffic betw r een foreign ports under the recognized protection of our flag, it might be well to provide a uniform rate for their registration and documentation, so that the bona fide property rights of our citizens therein shall be duly evidenced and properly guarded, rursuant to the advice of the senate at the last session, I recognized the flag of the interna tional association of the Congo as that of a friendly government, avoiding in so doing any prejudgrm-ut or conflict in tlie territorial claims in that region, subse quently in the execution of the expressed wish of congress, appointed a commercial agent for the Congo basin. The importance of the rich prospective trade of the Cos igo valley has led to the general conviction that it should be open to all nations upon equal terms. The international conference for the consideration of this subject, called by the emperor of Germany, is now in session at Berlin. There are delegates in attend ance in behalf of the United States, and of the results of the conference fyou will he duly ad vised. The government of Corea has generally aided the efforts of the United States minister to se cure suitable premises for tv.e use of the lega tion. As the condition of diplomatic intercourse with eastern nations demands that the legation (♦remises to be owned by the represented power, advise that an appropriation be made for the acquisition of the property by the government of the United States already in possession of valu able premises at Tangiers, as a gift from the sul tan of Morrocco, as is stated hereafter they have lately received a similar gilt from the Siamese government. The government of Japan stands ready to grant us entensive grounds at Tokio whereon hi erect a suitable building for the lega tion court house and gail, and similar privileges can probably be secured in China and Peru. The owning of such premises would not only effect a large saving of the present rentals but would per init of the due assertion of extra territorial rights in those countries and would the better serve to maintain the dignity of the United States. The failure of congressto make appropriation for our representation at Aatonomos Court of the Khedive, lias proved a serious embarrassment in our intercourse with Egypt, and in view of the necessary intimacy of diplomatic relationship due to the participation of this government as one of the treaty powers in ail matters of admin istration. there affecting tin* rights of foreigners. I advise the restoration of the agency and consul ate general at Cairo on its former basis, Ido not conceive it t> le tin* wish of congrvss that the United States should withdraw altogether from the he norahle position they have hitherto held, with respect to the Khedive, or that citizens of this republic residing or sojourning in Egypt should hereafter he without the aid and protection of a competent representative. With France, the traditional cordial relationship continues THE 

BARTHOLDI STATUE OF LIBERTY ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD, the generous gift of the people of France, is ex pected to reach New York in May next. I sug gest that coigress may take action in relation to the spirit which has prompted this gift, ami in aid of the timely completion of the pedestal in which it is to he placed, OCR KKI-ATIONS WITH GERMANY, a country w hieh contributes to ours some of the best elements of citizenship, continue to be cor dial. The United Slates have extradition treaties with several of the German states but by reas* n of the confederation of these states under the imperial rule the application of such treaties Is not as uniform and comprehensive as the inter ests of the two countries require. 1 propose, therefore, to open negotiations for a convention of extradition to embrace all the territory of the empire. It offers me pleasure to say that OUR INTERCOURSE WITH GREAT BRITAIN continues to be of a most friendly character. The government of Hawhii has indicated its will ingness to contiKue for seven years tie provis ions of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such a continuance, in view of the relations of tlpt country tv) the American system of states should, in my judgment. Ik* favored. The revolution in Haytl agairst the established government haa terminated. While it was in progress it became necessary to enforce our neutrality laws by instituting proceedings against individuals and vessels charged with their in fringement. These revolutions wen* in all cas a successful. Much anxiety haa lately been dis played by various European governments, and es|M*cially by tin* government of Italy, for the abolition of our import duties upon works of art It is well to consider whether the vessel discriminations in favor of the importations of American artists abroad is not likely to result, as they themselves seem very generally to believe it may, in the practical expulsion of our painters and sculptors fmm the rich fields for observa tion, study and labor which they have hitherto enjoyed. There is a pms|>ect that the long pending revis ion of the foreign treatu*s of Japan may he con cluded at anew conference to be held at Tokio. While this government fully recognizes the equal nrul independent station of Japan in the commu nity of natious.it would not oppose the general adoption of such terms of compromise as Japan may he disposed to offer in furtherance of a uni form policy of intercourse with western nations. During the past year the increasing good will between our own government and that of Mexico has been variously manifested. The treaty of commercial reciprocity concluded Ju y 30, 1883. has been ratified and awaits the necessary tariff legislation of congress to become effective.* The legislation will, I doubt not, be among the first to claim your attention. A full treaty of commerce, navigation and consular rights is much to l>e desired, and such a treaty. I have rea son to l>elie\?, the Mexican government stands ready to conclude Some embarrassment has l*H*n occasioned by the failure of congress at its last session to provide means for the due execu tion of the treat v of July 39th. 18S2. for the re survey of the Mexican boundary, and the re-loca tion of boundary monuments. A CANAL, RAILWAY AND TELEGRAPH. With the republic of Nicaraugua a treaty has leen concluded which authorizes the construction by the United Slates of a canal, railway and tel egraph line across the Nicarauguan territory. By terms of this treaty sixty miles of the river SanJnan. as well as the lake Nicaraugua, an inland sea forty miles in width, are to constitute a part of the projected enterprise. This covers for actual canal purposes seventeen miles on the Pacific side, and thirty-six miles on the Atlantic to the United States, whose rich territory on the Pacific is fer the ordinary purposes of commerce practically cut off from communication by the water with the Atlantic ports. The political and commercial advantages of such a project can scarcely be over estimated. It is believed that when the treaty is laid before you the justice and liberality of its provisions will command uni versal approval at home and abroa-b The death of our representative at Russia, while at his post at St. Petersburg, afforded to the . imperial government a renewed opportunity to ! testify its sympathy in a manner befitting the ! intimate friendliness which has ever marked the intercourse of the two countries. The course of this government in raising its representative at Bangkok to the diplomatic rank has evoked from Siam evidences of worm friend ship. and augurs well for our enlarged interior The Siamese government has presented to the United States a commodious mansion and grounds for the occupancy of the legation, and I suggest that by joint resolution congress attest its appre | ciation of this generous gift. SPAIN. This government has more than once been I called on of late to take action in fullfillments of i international obligation toward Spain agitation I in the island of C üba hostile to the Spanish crown having been fermented by persons abusing the I sacred rights of hospitality whwh our territory affords. The officers of the government have : been instructed to exercise vigilance to prevent infractions of our neutrality laws at Key West ok! other parts near the* Cubaa coast, I am liappy to say that in only one instance where these precautionary measures ware successfully eluded the offenders, when found in our territory were subsequently tried and convicted. The growing need of a close relationship of inter course and traffic between the Spanish on tides and their natural market in the United States baa led to the adoption in January last of a com mercial agreement lookingjo that end. This agreement has been superseded by a more carefully framed and comprehensive convention, which I shall submit to the senate for approval It has been the aim of the negotiation to open such a favored reciprocal exchange of production curied under the dag of either country, as to make intercourse between Cuba and Porte Rico MINERAL POINT, ¥IS„ FRIDAY, DECEMBER 5 1881. ' and ourselves scarcely less intimate than the com mercial movement in our domestic ports and t© in sure the removal of the burdens on shipping in the Spanish 1 odias, of which in the past our ship owners and ship masters have so often had cause to complain. The negotiation of this convention lias, for a time, postponed the prosecution of certain claims of our citizens which were declared to be without the jurisdiction of the late Spani.-h American claims commission, and which we, there;ore, remitted to diplomatic channels for adjustment. The speedy settlement of these claims will now be urged by this government. Negotiations for a treaty of commercial recip rocity with tlie Domnican republic have been successfully concluded and the result will shortly be laid before the senate. Cert ■in questions be tween the United States and the Ottoman em pire still remain unsolved. Complaints in be half of ur citizens are not satisfactorily adjust ed. The Porte has sought to withhold from our commerce the right of favored treatment to which we are entitled by existing conventional stipulations and the revision of the tariffs as un accomplished The tioal disposition of pending questions with Venezuela has not a* yet been reached, but I have good reason to expect an early settlemeut. which will provide tlie means of re-examining the Cara cas awards, in conformity witli the expressed de sire of congress, and which will recognize the jus tice of certain claims preferred against Venezuela. THE C EXTRA I. AND SOUTH AMERICAS COMMISSION appointed by authority of the act of congress of July, ISM. will soon proceed to Mexico. It has been furnished with instructions which will be laid before you. They contain a statement of the general policy of the government for enlarging its commercial intercourse with American states. The commissioners have been actively preparing for their responsible task by holding conferences in the principalities with merchants and others interested in Central and South Amer ican trade. INTERNATIONAL MERIDIAN CONFERENCE. Lately convened in Washington tlie in vitation on the part of the United Statet, was com posed of representatives fron twenty-five na tions. The conference concluded its Tabors on the first of November. Having with substantial unanimity agreed upon the Meridian of Green wich as the starting point whence longitude is to be computed through 180 degrees eastward and westward, and upon the adoption for all pur poses for which it may be found convenient of a universal day, which shall begin at midnight and whose hours shall be counted from zero up to 34. The formal report of the transactions of this con ferenoe will be here after transmitted to con gress. This government is in frequent receipt of invi tations from states to participate in INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITIONS, often of great interest and importance. Occupy ing, as we do, an advanced position in the world's production, and aiming to secure a profitable -hare for our industries in the general competi tive markets, it is a matter of serious concern that the want of means for participation in these exhibits should so often exclude our producers from the advantages enjoyed by those of other countries. During the past year the attention of congress was drawn to the formal invitations in tliis regard tendered by the governments of Eng land, Holland, Belgium, Germany ad Austria. The executive has in some instances appointed honorary commissioners. This is, however, a most unsatisfactory expedient, for without some provision to meet the necessary working expenses of a commission, it can effect little or nothing in behalf of exhibitors. An international inventors’exhibition is to be held in London next May. This will cover a field of special importance in whien our country holds foremost rank. But tlie executive is at present powerless to organize a proper representation of our vast national interests in this direction. 1 have in several previous messages referred to this subject. It seems to me that a statute giving to the executive general discretionary authority to accept such invitations and to appoint honorary cotmiiMßioners without a salary, and placing at the disposal of the secretary of state a small fund for defraying their reasonable expenses, would lie of great public utility. 

COLLISIONS AT SEA. This government has receive 1 official notice that the revised international regulations, for pre venting collisions at sea, have l>een adopted by all the leading maritine powers except the United States, and came into force on the first of Septem ber last. For the due protection of our shipping interests, the provisions of our statutes should at oce be brought into proper relations with these regulations. The question of securing to authors, composers art ists COPY RIGHT PRIVILEGES. Iu this country, in return for reciprocal rights abroad as one that may justly •hallenge your at tention. It is true that a convention will be nec essary for fully accomplishing this result, but un til congress shall fix the extent to which foreign holders of copyright shall l>e here privileged, it has been deemed inadvisable to negotiate such convention for this reason. Tke United States were not represented at TUS RECENT CONFBRENCE AT BERNE I recommend that the scope of nuetrality laws of the United States be so enlarged as to cover all patent actsof hostility committed in our terri tory, and aimed against the peace of a friendly nation. Existing statutes prohibit the fitting out **f armed expeditious, and restrict the shipment of explosives though enactments in the latter respect were not framed with regard to interna tional obligations but simply for protection of passenger travel, an these statutes to meet spec ial emergencies that have already arisen other emergencies have arisen since a modern ingenui ty supplies means for organization of hostilities without upen resort to armed vessels or to fili blistering parties. I see no reason why overt preparations in this country for the commission of criminal acts such as are here under considera tion should not alike be punishable whether such act* are intended to be committed in our country or in a foreign country, with which we are at peace. The prompt ami thorough treatment of this question is one of which intimately covers the nations honor. OUR EXISTING NATURALIZATION LAWS also need revision. Those sections relating tr persons r* siding within the limits of the United States in 1795 ami 1798, have now only a hiscotica interest. Section 21,172, recognizing the citizen ship of tho children of naturalized parents, is am biguous in its terms and partly a'isolete. There are special provisions of law favoring the naturalization of those who serve in the army or in merchant vessels, while no similar privileges aru granted those who serve iu the navy or ma rine corps. An uniform rule of naturalization such as the constitution contemplates should, among other things, clearly define the status nf persons born within the United States, subje* t to a foreign power (sec. 1902), and of minor children of fathers who have declared their intention of becoming citizens, but have failed to perfect their naturalization. It might be wise to provide for a central bureau of registry, wherein should In* filed authentic transcripts of every record of naturalization in the several federal and state courts, and to make provision also for the vaca tion or cancellation of such record in cases where fraud had been practiced upon the court by the applicant himself, or w here he had re moved or forfeited his acquired citizenship. A just anti uniform law in this respect wou.d strengthen the handsof the government iu pro tecting its citizens abroad, ami would pave the way for the conclusion of treaties of n duraliza tiou with foreign countries. THE DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE. The legislation of the last session effected in ho diplomatic and consular service certain charges and reductions which have been produc tive of embarrassments. The population and commercial activity of our country, are steadily on tne increase amfarw giving rise to vary ing and often c'elicate relationship w ith other countries. Our foreign establishment now-em braces nearly double the area of operations that it did twenty years ago. after the conferment of such a service within the limits of expenditures, is not, it inems to me. in accordance w ith true economy, and a community of sixty millions of people should be adequately represented iu its intercourse with foreign nations. A project for the reorganization of consular s**r vice and for recasting the scheme of extra territorial jurisdiction is now before you. If tht limits of a short session will not allow its full consideration, I trust you will uot fail to make a suitable provision for*the present needs of the service. It has been customary to define is the appro priation acts the rank of each diplomatic office to wh'ch salary is attached, I suggest that this course be abandon* and and that it be left to the presidvnt, with the advice and consent of the senate, to fix, from tim** to time, the diplomatic grade of the representatives of this government abroad, as may seem advisable, provision being deflrf*“ly made, however, as now. for the amount o* salary attached to the respective stations. THE 

CONDITION OF OUR FINANCES and the operations on the various branches of the public service which are connected with the treasury department, are very fully discussed in the report of the secretary.

The aggregate receipts were levs than those of the rear previous by about 574.000.000. The falling off of revenue from cus toms made up nearly $20,000,000 of this deficiency and about $23,000,000 cf the remainder was due to the diminished receipts from internal taxa tion. The secretary estimates the total receipts for the fiscal year which will end June 30, iSSS, at S33O,(kX).<MO, and the total expenditures at $290.- 641.201, in which are included the interest on the debt and the amount payable to the sinking fund. This would leave a surplus for the entire vear of about $30.000,000. THE VALLE OF EXPORT! from the United States to foreign countries during the year ending June 30, 1884. was as follows- D-wnestic merchandise $724,964,852 Foreign merchandise 15^548.757 Total merchandise $740,513,009 Specie 67,333X83 Total exports of merchandise and spe cie $807,646,992 TH* COTTOS Alto CCrTTOH HASTEACTTKES.

I concur with the secretary of the treasury in ree mmending the immediate suspension of coin age of silver dollars and of Die issuance of silver ce-tiflcates. and this is a matter to which in for mer communications I have more than once in \ oked the attention of the national legislature. It appears that annually, fo, the past six years, there have beeucoinel in compliance with the requirements of the act of Feb. 38. 1878, more than twenty-seven million silver dollars, aud the number now coined is reported by the secretary to be nearly one hundred and eighty-five million, whereof but little more than forty million, or less than twenty-two per cent, are in actual circula tion. The mere existence of this fact seems to me to furnish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal of the statute, which has made such a fact possible, but there are other and graver considerations that tend in the same direction. The secretary avows his conviction that unless this coinage and the issuance of silver certificates be suspended, silver is likely, at no distant day, to become our sole metallic standard. The commercial disturbance and the impair ment of the national credit that would thus be occasioned can scarcely be over estimated. I hope that the secretary's suggestion respecting the withdrawal from circulation of the one dollar and two-dollar notes will receive your approval. It is likely that a considerable portion of the sil ver now incumbering the vaults in the treasury might thus find its way into the currency. While TRADE DOLLARS have ceased, for the present at least, to be an ele ment of active disturbance in our currency sys tem, some provision should be made for their surrender to the government. Iu view of the circumstances under which they were coined, and of the fact that they have never had a legal tender quality, there should be offered for them only a slight advance over their bullion value. The secretary, in the course of his report, con siders the propriety of 

BEAUTIFYING TIIE DESIGNS OF OUR SUBSIDIARY SILVER COINS, aud of so increasing their weight that they may bear due rati© of value of the standard dollar. His conclusions in this regard are cordially ap proved. In my annual raesage of 1883,1 recommended the abolition of all excise taxes except those re lating to distilled spirits. This recommendation is now renewed. In case these taxes shall be abolished, the revenues that will still remain to the government will, in my opinion, not only suf fice to meet its reasonable expenditures, but will afford a surplus large enough to permit such tar iff reduction as may seem to be advisable when the results of recent t evenue laws and commer cial treaties shall have shown in what quarters these reductions can he most judiciously effected. OUR FOREIGN TRADE. One of tlie gravest of the problems which ap peal to the wisdom of congress for solution is the ascertainment of the most effective means of in creasing our foreign trade, and thus relieving the depression under which our industries are uow languishing. The secretary of the treasury advises that the duty of investigating this subject be entrusted iu, the first instance to a competent commission. While fully recognizing the considerations that may be urged against this course, I am neverthe less of the opinion, that on the whole, no other would lie likely to effect speedier and better re sults. That portion of the Secretary'sp-eport which concerns that condition of our shipping interests cannot fail to command your attention. He em phatically recommends that as an incentive to the investment of American capital in American steamships, tke government shall by liberal payments for mail transportation, or otherwise, lend its active assistace to individual enterprise, and declares his belief that Hnless that lourse be pursued, our foreign carrying trade must remain as it is to day, almost exclusively in the handsof foreigners. one phase of this subject is not especially prom inent in view of the repeal act of June 36, 1884, of all salutary provisions arbitrarily compelling American vessels to carry the n Us to and from tlie United States. As it is accessary to make pro visions to compensate the owners of such vessels for performing that service after April, 1885, it is hoped that the whole subject will receive early consideration that will lead to tke enactment of such measures for the revival of our merchant marine as the wisdom of congress may devise. THE BONDS. The three percent, b mis of the government to the amount of more than $109,000,000 have, since my last annual message, been redeemed by the treasury. The bonds of that issue still outstanding amount to a little over $200,000,000, about cue fourth of which will be retired through the operations of the sinking fund during the com ing year. As these bonds still continue the chief basis for the circulation of the national banks the question how to avert the contraction of the currency caused by their returnmeut, is one of constantly increasing importance. U seems to be general 1/ conceded that the law governing this matter exacts from banks exces sive security and that in their present bond de posits a larger circulation than is now allowed may he granted with safety. I hope that bill which passed the senate at lasf session permitting the Issue of .notes equal to face va’ueof deposit ed bonds, will commend itself to the approval of the house of representatives. IN THE 

EXPENSES OF THE WAR DEPARTMENT the secretary reports a decrease of more than $9,000,000 of which a reduction of $5,000,000 was effected in expenditures for rivers and harbors, and $2,500,000 in expenditures for the quarter master department. Outside of that department the annual expenses of all the army bureaus proper, except possibly, the ordinance bureau, are substantially fixe*’ charges, which cannot be materially diminished without a change iu the numerical strength of the army. The expenditures in the quartermaster's de partment readily be subjected to adminis trative discretion, and it is reported by the sec iclary of war that as a result of exercising suck discretion in reducing the number of draught and pack animals in the army, the annual cost of supplying aud caring for such animals Is now $1,108,085.90 less than it w r as in 1882. The reports of military commanders slow that the last year has been notable for its freedom from Indiau'outbreaks. In defiance of the presi dents proclamation of July Ist, 1884, certain in truders sought to make settlements in the Indian Territory. They were promptly removed by a detachment of troops. During the past session of congress a bill to provide a suitable fire proof building for the army medical museum, and the library of the surgeon general's office received the approval of the senate. A similar bill reported favorably to the house c? representatives by one of its committees, is ftill pending before that body. It is hoped that during the coming session ihe measure may be come a law, and thereafter immediate steps may Ik* taken to secure a place ot safe deposit for these valuable collections, now in a slate of inse curity. The funds with which the works for the IMPROVEMENT OF RIVERS AND HARBORS were prosecuted during the past year were de rived from the appropriations of the act of Au gust 2. I>SH2, together w ijh such few balances as were on hand from previous appropriations. The balance in the treasury subject to requisi tion July Ist, 188S, was $10,921,519.55. The amount appropriated during the fiscal year 1884 was $13,19MW-27. The amount drawn from the treasury during the fiscal year was $8.228.703.M. % Leaving a balance cf $3,112,580.03 in the treas ury subject to requisition July 1. 1884. COAST DEFENSES. The secretary o£ war submits the report of chief of engineers as to the practicability of pro tecting our important cit ies oa the seaboard by fortifications acid other defences able to repel modern met bods of attack. The time has now come wlien such defences can be prepared with me confidence that they will not prove abortive, and when the possible results of delay in making such preparations is seriously considered, delay seems inexcusable. For the most important cit ies—those whose destruction or capture would be a national humiliation— adequate defences, in clusive of guns, may lie made by the gradual ex penditure of *t.ptW.OOO, a sum 'much less than a victorious enemy could levy as a contribution. An appropriation of about one-tenth of that aswmt is asked to begin the work, and I concur with tic secretary of war in urging that it he granted. The war department is proceeding with the conversion of 10-inch smooth-bore guns into 8 inch rifles by lining the former with tubes of forged or of cold wrought iron. Fifty guns will be thus converted within the year. This, how ever. does not obviate the necessity of providing means for the construction of guns of the highest power, but for the purposes of coast defense and for the armament of war vessels The report of the gun foundry board appointed April 4 1883, in pursuance of the act of March 3. 1883, was transmitted to congress in a special message of February 8, 1884. In my message of March 26, ISM. I called attention to the recom mendation of the board that the government should encourage the production of PRIVATE STEEL WOKES | of the required material for heavy cannon, and i that two government factories, out for the army ! and one for the navy, should be established for I the fabrication of guns of such material. So ae i tion having been taken, the board was subse i quently reconvened to determine more fully the plans and estimates for carrying out its recom mendation. It has received information which indicates that there are responsible steel manu facturers in this country who. although not pro vided at present with the necessary plant, are willing to construct the "t- and to make bs-'s f<w cen tracts with the government for the supply of the requisite material for tha heaviest guns adapted to modern warfare, if a guaranteed order of sufficient magnitude, accom panied by a positive appropriation extending , over a series cl years, shall be made by congress. All doubts as to th- feasibility of the plan being I thus removed. I renew my recommendation that such action be taken by con gress as wSI enable the government to construct its own ordinance upon ha own territory and so to provide the armaments demanded by considerations of naval safety and honor. The report of the secretary of the navy exhibits the progress which has been made on THE SEW 

STEEL CRUISERS authorised by the acts of August sth. 1882, and ' March 34.1 M-3. Of thefoor vessels under contract. one the Chicago. of 4.M0 tons, is more than half : finished. The Atlanta, of 3,000 tons, has bees i succ wafnlly launched, and h machinery is now ■ flrtir z. The Boston, ate of SOu* tons, to ready for launching and the Dolphin, a dispatch steam er, of 1,5 u) tons, is ready for delivery. Certain adverse criticisms upon the assigns of these cruisers are discussed by the secretary, who in sists that the correctness of the conciuslfcs, reach ed by the advisory board and by the department, has been demonstrated by recent development iu ship-building abroad The machinery of the double-turretted moni tors, Puritian. Terror and Amphilrite, contracted for under the not of March 3. 1883, is in process of construction. No work has been done during tlie past year on their armor for lack of the neces sary appropriation. A fourth monitor, the “Monaanock,” still remains unfinished at the navy yard in California. It is recommended that early steps be taken to complete these vessels and to provide also an armament for the monitor Mlantonomah. The recommendation of the naval advisory board, approved by the depart ment, comprise the construction of one steel cruiser of 4,300 tons, one cruiser of 3,000 tons, two heavy armored gun boats, one light cruising gun boat, one dispatch vessel armed with Hotchkiss cannon, one armored ram and three torpedo boats. The general designs, all of which are cal culated to meet the existing wants of the service, are now well advanced and the construction of the vessels can be undertaken as soon as you shall grant the necessary authority. THE JEANETTE CREW." The act of congress, approved August 7th. 1883. authorized the removal to the United Mates of the bodies of Lieut.-Commander, G. W. DeLong, and his companions of the Jeannette expedition. Tlie remains were taken from their grave in the Lena Delta in March. 1883, and were retained at Yakuesk until the follow ing winter, the season being too far advanced to admit of their imme diate transportation. They arrived at New York February 30, 1884, where they were received with suitable honors. In pursuance of the joint resolution of congress, approved February 13, 1884, a naval expedition was fitted out for 1 lie. RELIEF OF LIEUT. A. W. GREELEY, of the United States army, and of the partv who had been engaged under his command in scienti fic observations at Lady Franklin Bay. The fleet consisted of the steam sealer "Thetisi” purchased in England: the “Bear,” purchased ai St. Johns, New Foundland, and the • Alert,” which was generously provided by the British government. Preparations for the expepition were promptly made by the secretary of the navy. With the ac tive co-operation of the secretary t war. com - mander Geo. W. Coffin was placed in command of the “ Alert,” and Lieut. W. H. Eaierv iu com mand of the “Bear.” The “ Thetis ” was in trusted to Commander Winfield S. Schley, to whom also was assigned the superintendence of the entire expedition. Immediately upon its arrival at Upernavik the fleet began the dangerous navigation of Melville bay. and, in spite of every obstacle, reached Lit tleton Island on June 33d, a fortnight earlier than any vessel had before attained that point. On the same day it crossed over to Cape Sabine, where Lieut. Greely and the other survivors of his party were discovered. After taking on board tlie living, and the bodies of the dead, the relief ships sailed for St. Johns, where they arrived on July 17th. They were appropriate)!- received at Portsmouth, N.H., on August Ist, * and at New York on August Bth. One of the bodies was landed at the former place, the others were put ashore at Government island, and, with the excep tion of one which was interred in the national cem etery,were forwarded to the destinations indicated by friends. The organization aud conduct of this relief expedition reflects great credit upon all who contributed to its success. In this, the last of the state messages that I shall have the honor to transmit to the congress of the United States, I cannot too strongly urge •u Us attention the duty of RESTORING OCR NAVY as rapidly as possible to the high state of effi ciency whieh formerly characterized it. as the long peace that has lulled us into a sense of fan cied security may at any time be disturbed. It is plain that the policy of strengthening this arm of the service is dictated by considerations of use. economy of just regard for our future tran quility and of true appreciation of the dignity and honor of this republic. The report of the postmaster-general acquaints J’ou with tiie present condition aud needs of the 

POSTAL SERVICE. It discloses the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from the reduction in rate of letter post tage as recommended iu my message of December 1882, and effected by the act of March 3d, 1883, has been much less than was generally anticipated. My recommendation of this reduction was based upon the belief that the actual falling off in re- ou letter postage for the year immedia tely succeeding change of rate + would be £3.(XXV 000. it has proved to be only $2,275,000. This is a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restored to former volume by natural increases of sealed correspondence. I confidently repeat, therefore, the recommen dation of my last annual message, that .single rate postage upon drop letters be reduced to one cent wherever payment of 2 cents is now requir ed bylaw. The double ."ate is only exacted at offices where the carrier system is in opcation, and it appears that at these offices that the in crease of taxes upon local letters defrays cost not only of its own collect'ou and delivery, but of the collection and delivery of other mail* matter, and this is an inequality that ought not longer exist. I approve the recommendations of the Postmaster General that the unit of weight in the rating of first class matter should be one ounce instead of one half ounce as it now is. In view of the statistics furnished by the department it may be well doubted whether the change would result In any less revenue; if not, that it would greatly promote the convenience of the public, is beyond dispute. The free delivery system has been lately ap plied to five cities, and the total number of offices in which it is now in operation is one haudred and fifty nine. Experience shows that its adoption under proper conditions is equally an accommo dation to tiie public and an advantage.to the postal service being more than self-sustaining, and for the reason urged l>3* the post master-general may properly be extended. It is the opinion of that officer that it is proper to provide means whereby exceptional dispatch in dealing with letters in fret* delivery offices may be secured by payment of extraordinary postage. This scheme might be made effective by the employment of a special stamp, whose cost should be commensurate with the expense of the extra service. In some of the large cities private express companies have undertaken to outstrip the gov eminent mail carriers by affording for prompt transmission of letters better facilities than have hitherto been at tke command of the post office It has always been the policy of the government to discourage such enterprises, and m no be'ter way can that policy he maintained than in sup plying the public with tke most efficient mail service and that with due regard to its own best in terests, can be furnished for its accommoda tion. FEES. The attorney-general renews the recommenda tion contained in his report of last year touching fees of witnesses and jorors. He favors a radi cal change in the fee bill, the adoption of a sys tem by which attorneys and marshals of the United States should be compensated solely by salaries and the erection by the government of a penitentiary for the confinement of offenders against its laws. THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. Of the varied governmental concerns in charge of the interior department, the reports of its secretary present an interesting summary. Among the topics deserving particular attention I refer you to his observations respecting our In dian affairs, the preemption and timber culture acts, the failure of railroad companies to take title to lands granted by the government, and the operations of the pension offices, the patent office, the census bureau and the bureau of edu cation. Allusion has been made already to the circumstance that both, as between the different Indian tribes and as between the Indians and the whites, the past year has been one of unbroken peace. In this circum stance the president is glad to find a justification for the policy of the government in dealing with the Indian question, and a confirmation of the views which were fully expressed in his first com munication to the 47th congress. The st ere’ary urges anew enactment of the statute for the pun ishment of crimes committed on Indiaffp-cserca tions. and recommends the passage or ftie bill now {lending in the house o t representatives for the purchase of a tract of 18,000 square miles from the Sioux reservation. Both these meas ures are worthy of approval. I concur with him also, on advising THE 

REPEAT. OF THE PREEMPTION LAW, the enactment of statutes, involving the present legal complications touching lapsed grants to railroads and the funding of the debt of the sev eral Pacific railroads undar such guaranty as shall insure its ultimate payment. The report of the Utah commission will be read vith interest, it discloses the result of recent legislation looking to the prevention AND 

PCNISHMENT OF POLYGAMY in that territory, 1 still believe that if that ab ominable practice can lie suppressed by law, it can only be by the most radical legislation, consistent with restraints of the constitution. 1 again recommend, therefore, that congress assume absolute political control of the territory of Utah, and provide for the appointment of a commission with such governmental powers as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put Into their hands. In the course of this communication reference has more than once been made to the policy of this government as regards the EXTENSION OF OCR FOREIGN TRADE. It seems proper to declare the general prin ciples that should, in my opinion, underlie our national efforts In this direction. The main con ditions of the problem may be thus stated: We are a people of mechanical pursuits, and fertile in invention, and we cover a vast extent ot ter ritory, lich In agricultural products, and in nearly ail the raw materials necessary for successful manufacture. We have a system of productive • - iMishraents more than sufficient to supply demands. The wages of labor are now here also so great, and the scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their personal comfort and the development of those higher morals and intellectual qualities that go to the maxing of good citizens. Our system of tax and tariff legislation is yield ing a rerenae which is in excess of the present needs of the government These are elements from whkh it is sought to den-e a scheme by which, without unfavorably changing the condi tion of our working men. our merchant marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new markets provided for that sale beyond our borders of the manifold fruits of our industrial enterprises. The problem Is complex, and can be solved by no single measure of innovation or reform. The countries of the American continent and the ad jacent islands, are for the United States the nat u-a! market of supply and demand. It is from them that we should obtain what we do not pro duce. or do cot produce in sufficiency, and it is to them that the surplus productions of our fields, cur mills and our workshops should flow, under conditions that will equalize or favor than in comparison with foreign competition. Your pet.be of policy seem to point to this end. First—A aeries of reciprocal commercial trea ties with countries of Amerlct, which shall faster between as sod them an anfaa.-epered movement of trade. The conditions of there treaties should be the free admission of such met -handise as this country goes not produce, in return ‘or the admis sion free, or under a favored sebetre of dories, of o_r products. The benefits of szh exchange to apply on those goods carried uadrr the flag of the parties to the contract. The retroval on both odes from vessels to be se privflegid. of all ton nage dues and national imports, so List their ves sels may ply unhindered between kt ports sad those of the other osotracriag panes, though without infringing on the reserved hone coasting trade. The removal or reduction of tL* harden on the exported products of those countries com ing withia the benefits of the treaties, and the avoidance of the technicalities, restrictions and penalties by which our intercourse with those countries is at present hampered. Secondly.—The establishment of the consular service of the United States cm a salaried fooling, permitting the relinquishment of consular fees uot only as respects vessels under the national flag, but also as respects vessels of the treaty of nations carrying goods, entitled to the benefit of the treaties. ’ Thirdly.—The enactment of measures to favor the construction and maintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United States. Fourthly.—The establishment of a uniform currency basis for the countries of America, so that the coined products of o*ir mines may cir culate on equal terms throughout the whole sys tem of the commonwealth. This would require a monetary union of America, whereby the out put of the bullion producing countries and the circulation of those which yield neither gold uor silver, could be adjusted in conformity with the population, wealth anJ commercial needs of aach. As many of the countries furnish no bullion to the common stock the surplus of reduction of our mines and mints might thins lie utilized and a step taken toward the general remonetization of silver. To tlie accomplishment of these ends so far as they can be attairod by separate treaties the negotiations already concluded and now iu progress Lav© been directed, and the lavur with which this enlarged police has thus far been re ceived warrants the belief that its operations will ere long embrace all, or nearly all. the countries of this hemisphere. It is by no means desirable, however, that the policy under consideration should be applied to these countries alone. The healthful enlargement of trade with Eu rope, Asia and Africa should be sought by reduc ing tariff burdens on such of their wares as neither we nor tlie other American states are fitted to produce, and thus enabling ourselves to ebtain in return u better market of our supplies of food, ©f raw material aud of the manufactures iu which we excel. It seems to me that many of the embarrassing elements in the great national conflict between protection and free trade may thus be turned to good account, that the revenue maybe reduced so as no longer to overtax the people that protective duties may be retained without becoming burdensome, that our sl-.ipping interests may be judiciously encourag ed. The cutrency fixed on firm bases, and above all such an unit3* of interests established among the states of tlie American system as will be of great aud ever increasing advantage to them all. All treaties iu the line of this policy which have been negotiate,! or are iu process of negotiation, contain a pro vision deemed to be requisite under a clause of the constitution, limiting to the house of repre sentatives the authority to originate bills for raising revenue. Ou tlie twenty-ninth of February last I trans mitted to the congress the first annual report of THE 

CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, together with communications from the heads of several executive departments of the govern ment respecting the practical working of the law under w hich the commission had been acting. The good results therein foreshadowed bad I wen more than realized. The system has fullv an swered the expectations of its friends in securing competent and faithful servants, and in protect ing the appointing officers of the government from the pressures of personal importunity, and from the labor of examining claims and preten tions of rival candidates for public employment The law has had the unqualified support of the president and of the heads of the several depart ments, aud the members of the commission have performed their duties with zeal and fidelity. Their reports w ill shortly be submitted, aud will be accompanied by such recommendations for enlarging the scope of the existing statute as shall commend themsel’ es to the executive and tlie coramissionets charged with the administration. Iu view of the general and persistent demand throughout the commercial community for A 

NATIONAL BANKRUPT LAW, I hope that the differences of sentiment, which have hitherto prevented its enactment, may not out last the present session. THE CHOLERA. Tlie pestilence, which for the past two years has been raging iu the countries of the east, recently made its appearance in European ports, with which we are in constant communication. The then, secretary of the treasury, iu pursuance of a proclamation of the president, issued certain reg ulations restricting and for a time prohibiting the importation of mgs and tlieiujoiissionof baggage of immigrants and of Travelers arriving from in fected quarters. Lest this course may have been witlio H strict warrant of Jaw. I approve recom mendation of the present secretary that congress take action in the premises, e nd i also recommend the immediate adoption of such measures, as w ill bo likely to w ard off the dreaded epidemic and to mitigate its severity in case it shall unhappily ex tend to our shores. 

ULSTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The annual report ©r the commissioners of the District of Columbia reviews the operations of the several departments of its municipal gov ernment, and I ask your careful consideration of its suggestions in respect to legislation especially commending such as relate to a revision of the civil and criminal code, the performace of labor by persons sentenced to imprisonment in the jail, the construction aud occupation of wharves along the river front and the erection of a suitable building or districtoffices. A PENSION FOR GRANT. I recommend that in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses S. Grant, late general of the armies of the United States, and twice president of this nation, that congress confer open him a suitable pension. Am certain of the measures that seem to me necessary and expedient, 1 have now in obeyance to tlie constitution recommended for your adop tion. As respects others of no less importance, I shall content myself with renewing the com mendations already made to congress without restating the grounds upon which such retom meudations are based. THE 

PRESERVATION OF THE FORESTS on the public domain, the granting of govern ment aid for popular education, the amendment of the federal constitution so as to make effective the disapproval by the president of pirticular items in appropriating bills, the enactment of statutes in regard to the filling of vacancies in the presidential office, and the determining of vexed questions respecting the presidential abil ity are measures which may justly receive your serious considerations. 

GOOD DYE. As time draws near when Ia n to retire from public service I cannot refrain from expressing to the members of the national legislature, with whom I have been brought into personal and of ficial intercourse, my sincere appreciation of their unfailing, courteous andoftneir harmoni ous co-operation with the executive in so many measures calculated to promote the best inter ests of the natiou, and to my fellow citizens gen erally I acknowledge a deep sense of obligation for the support which they have accorded me in the administration of the executive department of the government. Signed; CHESTER A. ARTHUR, Washington, December 1, 1881. CONGRESSIONAL Monday, December 1. Senate. —The opening session of tiie sanate was pieceJtd by a lively half hour hand shaking and gossips between the senators and their friends. Several desks of the senators were decorated with flora 1 tributes sent by admirers. The Kiosc favored being Senator Gor man, who was a recipient of two enormous '“roosters” and an arm chair, the latter bearing the words, “reserved for A, P. 0., 188a.” Those of ten a tors Ingalls, Maxly, Harris, Sable, Voor bees, Camden, Conger and Lapham were variously decorated with horse shoes, streamers and bsskets. The gal leries were filled with strangers. Promptly at noon the Pieei dent of tha senate called the body to order after which prayer was effertd. On motion of Sen. Logan, the secretary was instructed to inform the senate that the house was ready to pro cede to business. Venator* Sherman and Garland were appointed a commit tee to inform the president that the sen ate was ready to rejeive any communi cation he might be pleased to make. The secretary read the credentials of Wm. P. Sheffield, appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Sen. Anthony. At 1:35 the president’s mes sage was received and the reading pro ceeded with. When the reading of the message wat concluded, S*n. Aldrich in a few feeling remarks made a for mal announcement of the death of Sen ator Anthony, and the senate adjourn ed. House. —The galleries of the home were well filled this morning with spec tators. all anxious to view ih. proceed ings attendant on the first day of the ses-ion. Numerous floral designs or namented the desks of fnvoriu# members, and among them a handsome ship of state, of which Cox, of New York, was the recipient.

A (Juiet us to Republican Buga boos. . Lovisvimt,Ky..Dec. 2.—Somebody | wrote from New York to Henry Wat | terson of the Courier Journal, spies sing the fear that when the duiocr.\u gel into power they will K>ail the rebel debt upon the government, and also pay for the slaves set free by federal authority during the war. and pension lire rebel soldiers. To these points the witty Watiersou makes reply: To this we have to answer. First That the people of the south will attempt to obtain payment for their former slaves. Let them attempt. Waiving, for the moment, the in hibition, how are they going to get it? Where is the money to come from? Who is to vote it? Is there a man, north or south, with sense enough to carry a bag of wheat to mill, capable of believing that ten white voters and throe black voters are likely to tax themselves to pay the attorney of a dead slave owner for a doubtful darkey who went to the worms a dozen years ago! A man who stands in dread of that deserves to have holes bored iu the top of his skull to let the darkm .s oat. The south may, indeed, extract sunbeams from eacunibers It may discover a short cut to tin* moon by hand ’• asket express around Cape Horn. But as for ever reclaim ing those slaves or gelling pay for them, that will happen when Niagara turns about and flows up stream! In the language of Capt. Simon Buggs of the Tallapoosa Volunteers, the South says simply, “Them niggers is gone from me and mine forever hi’ furover.” Second That the South will have the rebel soldiers pension) and and the rebel war debts paid. The pension list is already an exact ing load. It approximates SIUU,(HK>, 000 annually. There is no thought in the South of increasing it. The boys who wofe the gray took a through ticket and hist. They played a fair, open and manly game. They have mver whined about it. and they do not propose to foul it at this late day. They expect no pension ami want none. 1 f ever a proposition to that end is made, it will cither come from Northern Republicans seeking rebel alliances, i*r from some irrospomiolo Southern demagogue, who thinks to come it over his constituents, but who will be quickly sat down upon. Be sure of that. j\s for the payment of rebel tl‘hb, the constltu lit*nof iiu> I'niteJ Stab s, article \IV*. says; Sv 4. “I he validity of the public lel*t of 11C ’’niictl Siates, authorized by law, including drill* incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services iu suppress!**; insurrection or rebel lion, shall not Im* 4piesth*ne<l. Hut neither the Fniied States or any slate, shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid *f any in sum*ollon or reUlli#n against Ui* I nite*! States, >r any claim for the loss or cmu,.. ipatmn tf any slave’hut all such debts, obligations am I claims shall Ih* held illegal and void." This is pretty strong language, isn't it? It has a case-mated, iron clad ring about it, hasn’t it? It is toler ably “numerous,” too, covers “a heap o’ ground,” and looks like it was made to last One would think so when reading the liflh article of the constitution, he finds that it can only be set aside or amended, as fol lows: “The congress, whenever two thirds >f both houses shad deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this constitution, or, on the no plication of the legislatures of two thirds of ins several atf.tes, shall call a convention for propos ing amendments, which, in either ease, shah b* valid to all intents and pm ,loses, as parts *f this constitution when ratilh-Hl by the Icgislalurcn three fourths of the several states, or by conveu tions in three fourths thereof '* This is also a pretty tight-fitting old sticking plaster, isn’t it ? So here you have it. How do you like it? Ho you think, if we wanted to pension soldiers who are able and willing to support themselves, to get pay for niggers we never lost, and to settle a debt created for being licked supposing us to be such a set ol ever laHing fools—do you really think now wecoulu make sure of the vote of New York? How, for example, would Vermont go? Then, there are the other eastern Matts, and the mid die states, and the northern styles, and the northwestern states, and the Pacific states. Is it the opmon of tbecredulous republicans who think the south and free trade art; coming “on wheels” with a car load of “i uni, roman ism and rebellion," to blight and wither Iwyal people, that te can obtain the requisite two Hinds and three fourths vole iu the c rngros.s and the slates to amend the constitution and the nig ger and the rebels, and the dogs and the cals a whack at the treasury? If thera are any such, let us know, and we promise l > see that Prosident Arthur sends the fool killer around with a hatchet and a chronio before he retiles from office. No, no, friend Nichols, the wind sets U"t iu that quarter. The people of the south are just like the people of the north, no belter and no worse. We are not playiag for a dead horse. We arc n t, and we have not been sitting like a bump on a log. It is irue that we have had to tug al the hind teat a long, long time. But we have kept up a devil of a lugging, and now that our pail of milk is full, we hive no idea of kicking it ove*'. Closing Down. Pittsburg, Dec. 2.
