Mr. Waiiamukor's viowh are expressed in those worclm "The letter writers, who contribute the largest portion of the"i)OKtal tax puid into the treasury, may justly claim that thin money ahull be given back to them in lower rates or new facilities At lire ent a part of the letter poxtnge is applied to forwarding military euiiolios to tlio nrmv. trees and Bhrubs to agiicnltin-al stations, and huge Iwxoh of census ulimlcu to the farthest end or the country.

The theory is that the postotlice department mutifc pay its expemes iteioro any reduction is made and the tremendous bulk of dead head matter is charged up to the expense of tlie postofliee department und indirectly to those that use tlie mails, whereas if each department were compelled to buy stamps the same as private individuals and have the cost charged up to the expense of the de partments, the postofliee department would hIiow a big profit every year in Htead of a deficit. The postotiice de partment is carrying tlie load of all the other departments and tlio public is compelled to Bulfer, There is an increased agitafion of the one cent letter postage question, and it iH understood that a hill will bo intro duced at once providing for the reduc tion. Mr. SVanainaher says further, in his repbrt, that "it does in'it seem fair to letter writers to take the prolit made upon the transportation of letters and give it away for the mpport of the war, the agricultural or tli ::iterior depart ment. The postofliee Co, art meut would be selt-Mistaining if it had ere lit for the work it does for nothing and if these different classes of mail matter were all put upon a Holf-supporting basis." , - NEVVSJNBRIEF: A ComlciiHiitlmi til IiitereHtljig Items ou Viii'Iiikta Nulilects, Surgeon General liaxtcr was stricken with paralysis Alonday.

Indigestion IS not only a distressing complaint,'of itself, but, by causing the blood to become depraved and the system en feebled, is the parent of innumerable maladies. That Aycr's SarsapariUa is the best cure for Indigestion, even when complicated with Liver Complaint, is proved by the following testimony from Mrs. Joseph Lake, of Brockway Centre, Mich.: "Liver complaint and indigestion made my life a burden and came near ending my existence. For more than four years I suffered untold agony, was reduced almost to a skeleton, and hardly had strength to drag myself about. All kinds of food distressed me, and only the most delicate could be digested at all. Within the time mentioned several physicians treated me without giving re lief. Nothing that I took seemed to do any permanent good until I commenced the use of Ayer's SarsapariUa, which has produced wonderful results. Soon after commencing to take the Sarsapa riUa I could see an improvement in my condition. My appetite began to return and with it came the ability to digest all the food taken, mys strength im proved each day, and after a few months of faithful attention to your directions, I found myself a well woman, able to attend to all household duties. The medicine has given me a new lease of life." Ayer's SarsapariUa,' ' """

Nine-tenths of all the ailments to which the human family is heir, aro dependent on nervous exhaustion and impaired digestion. When there is an insufficient supply of nerve food in tho blood, a general stale of debility of the brain, spinal marrow and nerves is the result. Starved nerves, like starved muscles, become strong when tho right kind of food is supplied, and a thousand weaknesses and ailments disappear A3 tho nerves recover. As tho nervous system must supply all tho power by which the Vital forces of the body are carried on, ii ia the first to suffer for want of perfect nutrition. Ordinary food does not contain a sufficient quantity of tho kind of nutriment necessary to repair tho wear our present inodo or living and labor imposes upon the nerves. For this reason it becomes necessary that a nerve food bo supplied. This recent production of the South American Continent has been found, by analysis, to contain the essential elements out of which nerve tissue is formed.
