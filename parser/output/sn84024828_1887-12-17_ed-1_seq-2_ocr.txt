following to say about the Territories In all otthe Terrftoriesjhere has been a considerable increaso during thoyear in population and in wealth In Arizona and New Mexico the native population and that of Spanish extraction has not pout ten years while during that period the total population of New Mexico has increased about 20 per cent and that of Arizona more than 100 per cent The prwjnt population of tho Territories is estimated respectively as follows Ari zona 90000 Dakota 508400 Idaho 97250 Montana 130000 New Mexico 101000 Utah 105500 Washington 142301 Wiomfnir 85000 Alaska 1ms n

fertility of largo areas heretofore suppos ed to lc arid or desert lands valuable only fnr grazing purposes Garden farms in Arizona and New Mexico yield rich semi tropieal products in profusion and orch ards in Utah and Idaho furnish a great variety of fmitH of such ecellent quality that extensive shipment are already made to the eastward and the highest prices obtained The rapid agricultural development as well as the heavy losses in tho northern Territories from the unusual severity of last winter together with the low prices prevalent during tho year have some what checked the progress of the cattle industry po far as it is carried on upon largo ranches but great advances in other important branches of stock raising have rnoro than counterbalanced this depres sion The yearly product

Prescott this week l PBBScoTf Dec 12 1887 To tha Hon James H Wright Judge of the Third Judicial District Territory of Arizona We the United States Grand Jury for the November term 1887 beg leave to make this our final report and Tequest that We be discharged We have examined all charges brought before us and find indictments as follows Perjury 2 Summation of Perjury 1 Selling whisky to Indiansrl Polygamy 1 Adultery 2 - We feel satisfied that many cases exist where parries have unlawfully cut and re moved timber from Government land and illegally ontered and taken up Gov ernmenHand and while we would have been glad to investigate such cases we have not bad tho proper evidence laid before us We would most respectfully request that the proper government offi cials look fully into these matters and when cases aro found to have tho evi dence and w itnesscs ready for cxamina tion and investigation by the next U S Grand Jury if possible the Investigation to t over all parts of this District The attention of the Grand Jury has heeti called to the fact that certain coun ties of this Territory have seemingly dis regarded an Act of Congress passed for the purpose of chocking extravagance in the administration of county affairs in the Territories and usually known and tcrmod the Harrison Act It Is assert ed that the counties referred to have within tho past year issued evidences of indebtedness in excess of the limit pre scribed In and by said Act in violation of law We would therefore recommend thaj tjie U S Attorney make such n investi gation into tho affairs of the different counties as will determine the truth or falsity of such assertions and if found as represented present thn same with proper witnesses to tho next U B Grand Jury for their consideration that tho responsi bility may be fixed and the guilty parties punished accordingly O N Cbzssweix Foreman of the Grand Jury r4H R Ki tovMta WASUirVGTOIV
