If President Cleveland knows who will be. in the next cabinet he really ought to have said something about It. 3Ie.\Ieo Is the place where the pro posed candhlaey of llryan for the. presi dency In 1)00 ! ) Is most favorably re ceived. Tlit ! merchants who are doing the business arc the merchants who are patronizing the advertising columns of The Ilee. There Is encouragement In the mes- eage. for all concerned In the Cuban controversy. Yon pay.s your money and takes your choice. Compare The Ilee with the correspond ing Issue of any of Its competitors In these parts and note the difference in quality and quantity. It Is safe to predict that the projected pipe lines from the Wyoming oil fields will have branches to the oil rooms of neighboring legislatures. The question Is : Did the Standard Oil monopoly stop lubricating the oil Inspection machinery when Oil Inspector Hilton steppetl down and out of olllee ? The killing of an Indian by a locomo tive the other day effectively ttymlio- ll/.es the passing away of an aboriginal race before the advance of civilization. Secretary Carlisle's predictions that the Wilson bill delicti was to be tem porary only are now interesting rending. The secretary Is entitled to another guess. Toronto Is agitated over the question of .Sunday street cars. Toronto ought sto move across the border Into the United States and catch up with the tlllll'H. The people of Omahii want a union depot and not a passenger station for one _ pr two roads. That Is the main fact which should be kept before the mind. Now for good men for the executive positions In the exposition. In select ing ollicers and committees ability and illness for the place should be the sole qualifications. The only passenger depot worthy of the name that Omaha ever had was built by the Union Pacific. The union depot project Is not to be helped by at tacking the present receivers of that road. If Mr. Rockefeller breaks Mr. Carno- glo's steel rail monopoly Mr. Carnegie can get even by going after Mr. Itocke- feller'K Standard OH monopoly. And the public will applaud both sides lin- I > artially. i General Maceo has gone to New York , whether as a fugitive or as a pleasure- Becker does not yet transpire. At any rate no great advantage to the royalist cause has yet been reported as a result of his absence. If Ambassador Hayard's Ilrlllsli friends wnnted to surprise him with n present they might hinv at least the politeness not to inform him In advau.-o that they were soliciting subscriptions for that purpose. It IH perhaps fortunate all round that Ambassador Ilayard discovered In time the section of the American constitution whlclj forbids a KervafM of the United States to accept "any present" from "any king , prince or foreign state. " Those charter committees must wake up to the fact 'that the time Is limited in which their work Is to be performed , ' Less than n month remains before the convening of the legislature and the proposed charter revision bll ! ought to bo ready for Introduction during the first days of the session.

TIIK I'llKUWKXrS MKSSAOK. Tlio fourth nml farewell annual men- sago of I'rcHldent ' Cleveland can be commended ns n clear and adequate prescnlntlon of public , questions. It very properly begins with n. reference , entirely optimistic In tone , to the result of the late political contest , In which the president finds rcnson for fnlth In the good sense and patriotism of the people. What Mr. Cleveland sayw In this connection offers no encouragement to those who are still disposed to doubt whether the people can be trusted to do the right thing In a great emergency. The position of the president on the Cuban question , which Is the one of { omiunndlng Importance in our foreign relation- * , will be approved by the con servative Judgment of the country. It should also be satisfactory to th Spnn- Isli g .vernment , since It gives assuraneo that the course thus far pursued by our government will be adhered to by the preAcnl administration If the conditions In Cuba continue as they have been. These are not of n nature , In the opinion of ihe president , to justify any change of lutttude on the part of the United States. He conclusively answers the proposals regarding belligerent rights and the recognition of the Independence of the Cubans , saying with respect to the former that It would be untimely and Injurious to our Interests. Un doubtedly to accord belligerent rights would result In destroying what remain ing trade we have with Cuba , because It would be followed by Spain block ading every Cuban port. As to recog nising the Independence of the Insur gents , the president points out that they have no government and that fact Is sutllclent to dispose of the proposition. As to Intervention , even at the cost of war , Mr. Cleveland observes , while evi dently believing that war between the United States and Spain would speedily end In victory for this country , that "the United Stales has nevertheless a character to maintain as a nation , which plainly dictates that right and not might should be thu rule of Its con duct. " lint the president points out that circumstances may arise that will compel our government to take action for bringing the contest In Cuba to an end. lie remarks that "it cannot be reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United State : ? will be indefinitely maintained. " and he describes a possible situation In which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain "will bo superseded by higher obligations which we can hardly hesi tate to recognize and discharge. " In his treatment of the Cuban question Mr. Cleveland shows a clear and sound understanding of the obligations and the Interests of the United States and It ought to make a good Impression abroad. Mr. Cleveland still has faith In the adequacy of the present tariff law for providing revenue. He admits that It has shortcomings as a tariff reform measure , but he thinks that if allowed a fair opportunity it "will , in the near future yield a revenue which , with rea sonably economical expenditures , will overcome all deficiencies. " A tariff law that has been In operation more than two years has certainly had a fair op portunity and to continue it In face of the record of uniform monthly deficits would be supreme folly. What the president offers In defense of this act Is extremely weak and his idea that making deficits Is not a matter that need excite or disturb us will not com mend Itself to the approbation of prac tical men. It Is true that thu treasury has n considerable sum of money on hand , most of It obtained by the sale of bonds , but this does licit warrant the government In continuing to Increase Its Indebtedness. The policy In the past , under republican rule , has been to provide enough revenuu to reduce Indebtedness and there must bo a. re turn to this policy If the solvency of thu government is to be maintained. Mr. Cleveland seems to be entirely oblivions to this duty of the govern ment. As a matter of fact the govern ment is now living beyond its Income and It should stop doing so as soon as possible. In regard to ( lie currency , Mr. Cleve land again urges the retirement of the greenbacks , offering no new argument In support of the proposition , which It Is needless to say will receive no consider ation from congress. In this connec tion he niaues a suggestion that merits attention , which Is that of allowing the organization of smaller banks anil In less populous communities than are now permitted. A bill for this purposu was Introduced at ( lie last session of congress , Intended to provide better banking facilities In localities where such facilities are inadequate. Mr. Cleveland urges further legisla tion against the trusts , existing laws having proved Ineffective , and he con cludes his message only the most Im portant features of which we have here noticed with an earnest appeal to con gress for rigid economy In expenditures that ought to be heedud. Thu latest statistics regarding thu ex ports of manufactures show a steady progress. This evidence that the products of our manufacturing Indus tries are finding larger acceptance In foreign markets attests the superiority of American skill and .workmanshl.i ) and Is therefore very gratifying , Tlr.'re Is no .question that In some lines the nmnufaelurcni of the United .States ex cel those of nny other country and this with the greater cfllckMiey of American labor ought to j > nable us to make con tinued progress In the worlds' neutral markets. With regard to thu Increased exports of the past year , the dllllculty Is to de termine whether it has been really profitable. The probability Is that much of It has not hi-cn , that owing to ( lie depression In the home market our manufacturers have sent goods abroad to be sold at prices which were unprofitable - profitable , preferring to turn them Into money even at a loss rather than hold them. Hut the Introduction of Ameri can goods Into foreign markets may bu expected to have beneficial results , pro vided we are able to make them at n cost allowing competition with the products of cheaper labor. Uut what American manufacturers wnut la more of the home market. Kor the past two ycnrs they have been los ing the share In the home market they formerly had and they need to have this restored to them. They may con tinue to cultivate the foreign markets , but It Is here they must look for a fair return on their Investments , < 1 ACCKl'IS. The opinion expressed by Mr. Cleve land In his message , that Venezuela would assent to the treaty submitting to arbitration the boundary dispute be tween that country and Great llrltaln , was well founded. The secretary of state has been Informed that the Venezuelan government lias accepted the agreement and has called n special session of congress to consider It. Un doubtedly the congress will approve the action of the government and thus re move from further controversy a matter which has been n menace to the peace ful relations of two great nations. The president says of the treaty , which pro vides for three arbitrators , that it is eminently just and fair and a result satisfactory to the countries concerned Is to bu expected from It. The consum mation of this agreement Is of great Importance : us a precedent ami It Is pretty safe to say that hereafter any boundary disputes that may occur be tween Kuropean nations and countries In this hemisphere will be settled by arbltiatlon. Kuropean governments , there Is every reason to bplleve , will not hesitate to recognize this. Ger man and French newspapers have pro claimed that the acceptance by Kng- land of the Monroe doctrine , under which the United State's asserts Its right to interpose In behalf of coun tries In this hemisphere having foreign controversies , has no binding force upon other nations of Europe. Unques tionably that Is true , but none the less they will follow Kngland In this if ever another exigency shall arise requiring the assertion of the Monroe doctrine ami there can bu no doubt that In time the world will accept that doctrine as u part of International law. They must now understand that , this country will never surrender It , even If a demand to do so came from the combined powers of Kurope. The present administration has doup nothing more creditable to It than the consummation of the agreement for set tltng the Venezuelan boundary dispute by arbitration. KXCOUllAdl ! The growth of the leading Amerlcai cities has been chiefly due to the de velopmunt of manufacturing Industry Commerce alone will not support a great population. Swapping Jackknlves or speculating In corner lots doe.s no create material wealth , although some prople may make a living by It. Tin true foundation of prosperity must In. the opportunity offered , for employmen to wageworkers. Our greatest cities therefore , are the greatest manufaetur Ing centers and the city that succeeds ii attracting capital for niiuuifaclm-in ; , enterprises Is the city of.-greate.s promise. These fundamental truths should bt kept constantly before thu men .inter csted In promoting the growth 'am prosperity of Omaha. The exporlenci , of all manufacturing centers lias beei that their great concerns have rise ! from small beginnings. While present Industrial conditions make It very dlf Heult for small factories to compote with large establishments backed bj unlimited capital , yet tln y may ' bj thrift , skill and business tact not onl.\ hold their own , but eventually reach a level with their wealthier competitors I'Jverythlug depends up/m the en couragements offered those who are seeking a location In which to venture In manufacturing enterprise. In many respeeN Omaha presents advantages over other western cities as a location for certain classes of mills and factories. It has : i)0n,000 ( ) people within a radlu ; < of UOO miles whose patronage can be secured. The territory tributary to It produces raw materials that can be profitably worked up Into finished products for which there Is a steady demand. It offers laboring men cheap living ami comforts which they cannot get farther west. All that Is needed to give Oirxha new factories and mills Is such assistance from local capltali.s's and property owners as will counter balance Inducements offered to Investor ; ? In other cities. ICvery republican leader In congress recognizes the fact that the popular demand Is for a protective tariff , but for a protective tariff framed upon cou sin vat Ivo lines. Thu people have given ovldi'tice that they oppose extremes In tariff legislation In both directions. At the same time they have condemned the present Wilson tariff law and will not be satisfied until It Is supplanted by a law affording adequate protection to American industries and Insuring lln- government the revenue required to de fray necessary expenses. According to thu report of the Iowa railroad commission the total earnings of this Iowa railroads last year was ; 

S..OOO.OOO more than the year preceding. That scarcely looks aa if thu roads were b > lng oppressed by thu maximum rate schedule In force there. And Iowa tales are considerably lower than Ne braska rates. T.here are plenty of measures pend ing before congress In which Nebraska Is specially Interested to keep the whole Nebraska delegation busy through the ci'.tii'o short session. If the delegation In both huusi's works together har moniously and energetically it will be sure to accomplish gootl for Its con stituents.

Philadelphia Hccord : Tlio outbreak of a 1'ttlo ' tariff war with Germany la not lljtcly to lead to anything more flcrlous than com mercial Inconvenience.

In eo doing ho de clared that UnglUh gold was at the bottom of the Hov.i uprising and that the Hovas and M. I.aroche were pensioners of the English. Continuing M. Mlehelln asserted that M.

Whereupon M. .Mlehelln moved that the government grant the railway concession to a French company without guaranteeing Interest or granting territory. M.
