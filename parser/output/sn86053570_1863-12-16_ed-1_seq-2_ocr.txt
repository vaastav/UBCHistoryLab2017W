The President'. Message (aod accomfe. In j documents) to the Thirty-eighth Congress hai given to the whole country a feeling of aautraeuon and an Increased confldence In the epcedy rettoratlon of Ibe Union upon a aonnder and more enduring bails than before the war. The statement presented of the condition of our public affaire, foreign and doiacatlc, It a gramying one. The tone of the President and Mi Cabinet ministers It calm, dignified, and reliant. There u no naiung or wavering. There It no pcrtur biatlon. No mere ezpcdlenu are proposed for getting out of dllcmms. Thero It no taming back, no abandonment of policy but we hare a steady movement forward. The emancipation proclamation, to far from being tct atlde It to bo the tut for those who would return to their allegiance. The traltorout elaveholdcr limit twear by It to prove hit fialty to the Govern ment agalnit which he had rebelled for the take of slavery. At In the general policy of the Prctldent to wardt the rebellion! district, so In the particu lar plant of each minister In bit department, thero It no retrogression. That which vat created by the last Congress Lit been found rood In principle, and nothing It recommended advorse, nothing proposed but modifications necessary to perfect the detail! of the dlflercnt rtteme. Our financial plants pronouneed good by me jimi.ier oi nneoce. We have a currency sufficient In volume, created by Congress since tne war organ, that lias worked wouden. A nation cannot eilst without a currency, any more than a human being could live wit, out a mucou! membrane, and Congress hai mado one which perform! ita office with Ual facility all ver th. country, which on It! face demand! allegiance of every man who recelics It and blndi lilm oter not onty u keep the peace but to nphold and defend the Government. The machinery of a curren cy being provided the Government has simply to borrow inch sums as may 1,8 required by the ellgences of the public service, and all the world has perfect filth In our ability to j ay. The ri ports of the lilaliter of War and Mln. liter of Marine present, In an onostenlallou. manner, .talcrnenls or facts which will attract the attention of the nbole world. The mighty energies jut forth by the Gov ernment and people In the equipment of our Immense armlas, and the building ofa poncr fnl navy, and the poivir of resource displayed, cannot fall to luiumuml lho admiration and respcel of nur ujtloni. Vtmn we had been robbed ol arms, arsenals and naty yards, an J bound like aampsou ilh green withes by II, plotlert of the rebellion, we put fonll a giant's strength In the construction ol war vcssils, cannon, and nil the Instruments of war. When the public works were Imutll clent, private enterprieosupptiedtbe deficiency, and we are able to arm ourscltcs without the aid of other countries. The Secretary of W ar, after enumeratlug the quantities of cannon and small armt provided within the last year, says that our resources for adding to this lui. meose store have only commenced their devel opment. Everything promises thst we shall saccp down upon the rebellion tilth resistless force during the coming year and that not only the treason but its cause will be removed, never more to plague the land.
