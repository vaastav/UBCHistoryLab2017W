One clause In the president's mes sage Is fraught with more significance than would appear on the surface. It relates to the tariff on forest products and is as follows: There should be no tariff on any forest produot grown In this country; and In especial there should be no tariff on wood pulp. The repeal of the duty on wood-pulp ahould. If possible, be accompanied by an agreement with Canada that there shall be no export duty on Canadian wood-pulp. Tariff revisionists, who have been tempted to complain because the pres ident did not take more decided and radical ground in favor of ome gen eral modification of the Dlngley sched ules, will find by a study of the Dlng ley law that the recommendation of the removal of the duty on forest products is as radical as the most ardent revisionist would wish..

Wooden furniture of all classes pays 35 per cent advalorem tax and nearly all the common woods of commerce pay from $1 to $2 per 100 cubic feet. Compliance with the recommenda tions of the president's messuage would furnish the greatest Impetus to the work of forest preservation, which is one of the most vital Questions before the country. It would, by Inviting com petition from Canada, lessen the bur den placed upon consumers by the ex actions of the Lumber trust and serve the general good In .many ways. Oppo sition to the measure will be abundant from Michigan, several Pacific coast states and in some parts of the south where the greed of the timber syndi cates has not yet accomplished the complete demolition of the timber re sources. The benefits that would fol low congressional enactment in line with the executive suggestion are so many and manifest that; congress should not hesitate to embody the president's recommendation into na tional law. 

YIELD OF AMERICAN TAR MS. The country understands, in a gen eral way, that the basis of its great wealth and prosperity lies in its agri cultural development, but it is almost Impossible to grasp the enormity of this wealth, as set out in the annual report of the secretary of agriculture. Mr. Wllspn's report furnishes data concerning the production of Amer ican farms which shows that all other sources of wealth In this country are comparatively Insignificant, great as they may be when considered individ ually. He places the grand total of agricultural wealth production for this year at $7,412,000,000, an increase of 10 per cent over 1906, which was the previous banner year in the hltoryof American agriculture. This produc tion was accomplished in the face of untoward conditions, requiring all the skill of our4 farmers to grow an aver age crop. The season was erratic and there was a scarcity of help, yet there was no general crop failure, ,even within small areas, and, while the pro duction was not up to the average, the financial returns, owing to a largely Increased foreign demand, will be larger than for those of any previous year. - ...v.r'" Corn still holds its kingly rank in the list of farm productions. The production of this cereal for 1907 la put at 2,563,732,000 bushels, or four fifths of the world's production of corn. There have been, three larger crops of corn In 1899, 1906 and 1906 but at the prevailing prices Its value will be about $1,360,000,000, or 26 per cent above the average value of the five crops preceding. There is some question as to the second crop In the list. The south, of course, halls cotton as king, but the secretary of agriculture places the hay crop second, with a value of $60,000,0p0, with cotton and Us products valued at 1650,000,000. Cotton ranks first in the list of our agricultural exports. The cotton supply, with the surplus left over from last year, 13 sufficient to meet the wants of the world. Wheat comes fourth In rank and, value, the production for the year being placed at 626,676,000 bushels, valued . at $500,000,000. This will meet local needs and leave about. 100,000,000 bushels for export ' The oats crop, while 19 per cent below the average In yield, is valued at $360,000,000, or 16 per cent above the five years' aver age value. The tobacco crop, aggre gating 645,213,000 pounds., is valued at $67,000,000. While much of this mammoth production is construed at home, the secretary furnishes these figures to show the important part played by farm products in the export trade: During the fiscal year ended June SO, 1907, the domestic exports of farm products were valued at 21,065,000.000, or tT,eoo,60o above the high : record for 1904. Plant products made up four-fifths of this total, cotton Slone amounting to 2482,000,000. Animals and animal products (mostly packing house products) were exported to the value of $256,000,000. The live animals exported were worth $41,000,000 and the dairy products 24.4U0.0Uv. Cotton is the greatest of all our exports. having. In 1807, 2i per cent of the total value. To animals and animal products must be credited 17 per cent of the total; to grains and grain products 10Vi per cent; to all other agricultural products per cent, and to foreat products 8 per cent Thus farm and foreat products made up, on a value ktsis, 71 Vi per cent of the total exports ef the United States In 1WI. The farmer does not depend alone on bis field crops. He produces meat animals; he keeps dairy cows, he raises sheep for mutton and wool and he keeps poultry. The animals sold from farms and those slaughtered upon thein in 1907 were worth $1,270,000.- 000, or about twice as much as the cotton crop. The dairy products of the country tor the year were worth 800,000,000, or more than any other crop except corn. The poultry and egg products were worth $600,000,000, or more than the wheat crop. Enormous as the present annual yield of farm products Is, the soli sur veyors of the Department of Agricul ture Insist that only about 420,000,000 acres of land can be classed as im proved, while but 290,000,000 can be classed as fruitful. The effort Is now directed to the study of these condi tions and the enlargement of the pro ductive area. This work should be encouraged, as the secretary urges in his report to congress. hoit mam- pvrvLisrsr The question, How many populists are there left in Nebraska? may be purely academic, but It nonetheless possesses Interest for those who like to keep up In political history. In 1890 the electorate of this state was divided almost equally into thirds and In the great gubernatorial contest of that year John H. Powers, as the populist candidate for governor, polled a total of 70.187 votes. How well the populists held their strength in the early years notwith standing the fact that they remained a minority party is seen in the returns of- the election of 1894, when they fused with tbo democrats for the first time and succeeded in seating a popu list governor. The fusion of 1894 was only partial, Including but a few places on the ticket, and John H. Powers, this time as the populist candidate for treasurer, polled 69,402 votes. In 189 5 there was no fusion what ever and the republicans won a victory over tbeir divided opponents. Yet without fusion in this off year the pop ulist candidate for supreme Judge, Samuel Maxwell, polled 70,566 votes. The next year, 1896, witnessed the perfection of fusion with its conse quent capture of all the political spoils for distribution between the so-called 'allied reform forces." So long as complete fusion was maintained the election returns could give no precise indication of the relative contribution of votes to a combined aggregate by the different constituent elements or ganized as populists, democrats and silver republicans. In 1904, although agreeing on a fusion state ticket, the democrats and populists failed to get together on the electoral ticket, with the result that for the first tjme the two parties reg istered thnir votes separately. The populist electors pledged to Watson and Tibbies received 20,618 votes. These, votes evidently represented the popular remonstrance within fusion ranks against Parker and Davis. The election held in this year 1907 has given another opportunity to dis tinguish the populist and democratic vote. Fusion was effected on only two of the places on the state ticket, leaving one candidate for university regent nominated by the democrats without any populist endorsement By the official canvass the combined vote for Sundern, upon whom the two par ties had fused for university regent, is 71,883, while the vote for Millard, who was on the ticket as the nominee of the democrats only, is 66,038. Making the subtraction, the difference is 5,845, which would apparently represent the number of votes gained by Sundean as a consequence of capturing the popu list endorsement. The persistent populists will, doubt less, refuse to accept this sort of arith metic or to admit that it even approx imately reflects the proportion In which they would be entitled to seek recognition in a fusion compact But the figures contain food for thought for men of all political faiths for Nebraska republicans as well as for the democrats and the remnant of the populists.

KOT1CS. Devoted supporters and admirers of Senator "Jeff" Davis, down In Ar kansas, were probably surprised at their failure to find any story of a riot in the senate on the second day of the session. . They had been led to expect that the first pages of the newspapers that morning would be Illumined with photographs of Senator "Jeff" Davis throwing the vice president out of the window and the trust emissaries hur rying to catch the first train out of Washington. "Jeff" Davis has usually made his word good in Arkansas Some times he has used his fists and again he has resorted to the use of a chair leg, but he has established some thing of a reputation for delivering the goods, and the Arkansawyers con fidently expected he would get into ac tion aa soon as the roll was called They had reason to look for action. In the campaign for the senatorship in Arkansas, Davla made and often re peated this solemn pledge: I pledge you my word, my fellow citizens. that if you, the most Intelligent mm of the greatest commonwealth of the greatest na tion on God's matchless earth, send me to represent you tn the greatest deliberative body that the sun ever shone upon, I will walk down the center aisle In my sock feet to the- vice president's desk, shake my boots in the Arctlo Fairbanks' face and de mand recognition In the name of you, my sovereign fellow cltlsens. That was his modest plan for secur ing recognition, and here la what he proposed to do: The proposition is, whether trusts are good or bad. I say they are bad, and I propose to destroy them. With such assurances, the Arkansas natives must have been chagrined to find that no mention was made of Davis' part in the proceedings of the first day. They probably figured that his train had been delayed. However, the next day's report added no new light that would explain the delay In starting the fireworks. If Davis Jiad done anything, he had evidently failed to remove his boots, for that would have certainly attracted the attention of the alert reporters of a servile and subsidised press who might otherwise refuse to notice the Arkansas man. .But Arkansas Is not to be disappointed. Davis Is going Into action on Wednes day, December 11, and then we shall see what we shall see. The veracious Congressional Record, In reporting the proceedings of the senate on Wednes day, December 4, contains this: Mr. Davis Introduced a bill (fl. 100) to suppress pools, trusts and combinations In trade, and to provide penalties for viola tions of Its provisions, and for other pur poses, which was read twice by Its title. Mr. Davls-I ask that the bill be laid on the table, subject to call, and I desire to give notice that on next Wednesday, the 11th Instsnt, I want to make a few remarks on the subject to which the bill refers. The Vice Presldent-The bill will lie on the tsble. Mr. Davis Subjeot to call. '; v So the time Is fixed. Trusts that persist In remaining In existence after next Wednesday will do so at their own risk. The pledge made to the un manlcured constituency In Arkansas is to be redeemed.' The Lincoln project for an extensive system of electric Interurban lines Is simply a reminder that Omaha has lagged far behind In this regard. For many years the desirability of such means of communication with Interior towns had been plainly before the peo ple of this city, but no effort of any Importance has yet been made to sup ply the need. Interurban electrlo lines should be given a prominent place on the Omaha . program for progress during the coming year. The destruction by fire of another largo Implement house at Council Bluffs serves to Impress upon the mind more forcibly than ever the efficiency of the Omaha fire department. The fire recently discovered in an Omaha warehouse was oombatted under the most discouraging circumstances, and yet was subdued with but a minor loss. The country merchant who opposed rural free delivery because he feared It would give the "mall order" houses an advantage in his territory, is now using the same argument against parcels-post extension. His fears are as groundless as they were in the rural delivery case. "At breakfast," says a woman's page contributor, "the family should feed upon smiles, hopeful words and morn ing kisses." That's all right with the panic on. but sausage and buckwheat cakes fill the bill better when the banks are honoring depositors' checks. A Philadelphia woman, In asking a divorce, says that sbe and her husband "separated and came together again fifteen times." ' An affair like that which is pulled off by rounds should be reported In the sporting columns and not In the police news. The double-page article in The Sun day Bee showing the condition of Omaha's banks, as compared with those of other cities In the west, should be sent broadcast through the east. Mall some of .them to your eastern correspondents today.

Why Wester Mea Win. Boston Globs (dem.). This sectionalism la not as proscrlptlva In its spirit as It might seem. There Is un doubtedly and unhappily some active pre judice against the east among western republicans. But to point to that as tho animating cause of their preference for western candidates would not be entirely fair. The choice of a national oonventlon goes by favor, and It Is only everyday human nature for the dominant westerners to pass the' honor around among them selves. They are a great family out there and Ohio la the mother of all the west lying above the historic line of SS-W. which was drawn in the Missouri compromise. That part of the country is the youngest and therefore very self-conscious and eagerly ambittoua.

Portland Oregonlan (rep.). A tub to 'the whale Mr. Foraker does throw, in the remark that "there must be supervision of railroad and of interstate commerce, of course,' but "It must be sane and conservative." This means the the regulation must take such form as the railroad managers and rebaters would approve. Wa have had their "sane and conservative" management all these years, with results .of continuous plunder and oppression on one hand and of favoritism, rebating and creations of combinations of vast wealth on the other. We shall hear now for a while, through voices like those of Foraker, that the Interruption of this system of organised plunder Is what has produced the present crisis and Is ruining the country. It la on this assump tion that he goes before the country as a candidate for the presidency. Possibly his effort, backed by the plu tocrats and predatory classes, may beat Taft. We may rather look for that result. It might bring the nomination to Hughes. That would be a proper, though unin tended consequence. It might, however, be a chief factor In forolng the offer ot the nomination upon Roosevelt again. For If the plutocratic backers of Foraker shall be able to put up a strong fight for htm. based ii It will be, oa bitter attacks, upon Roosevelt and his efforts to curb preda tory wealth,1 they will bring It about that the people will have nobody but Roosevelt.

PERSONAL NOTES. Emperor Franois Joseph haa now lived to complete the sixtieth year of hie reign. Even at 72 Mark Twain la young com pared with the Jokes that have brought him fame. Vlctorlen Sardou, at the age of 78, will shortly witness the production of his latest drama, "L'Affalre dea Poisons." Sardou is still alert and vigorous, mentally and physically, but he thinks his latest effort will be his last at play writing. When in the lottery for aeata In the house of representatives at the opening session, 3. Adam Bede of Minnesota, known as the wit of the house, drew No. 23. there was a storm of applause that Indicated the members as well as the galleries liked the Joke. John D. Bristol, the veteran American landscape painter, and one of the oldest members of the National Academy ot De sign, who Is poor and recently suffered a stroke of paralysis, has been removed to the Home for Incurables at Fordham, N.

While General Orosvunor passed out ' of the congressional limelight, Ohio still has In its delegation two veteran white-haired statesmen, who have passed 70 years of age General J. .Warren Keif er, ex-speaker of the house of representatives, and General Israel R, Sherwood, who represented Ohio thirty-four years ago. The seed which ultimately blossomed Into his greatest poem, "Hiawatha," was sown Into Longfellow's soul by an humble Ger man missionary, said Dr. Julius Goebel, professor of Germanic philology at Harvard university, in a lecture a few days ago In Chicago. A book written In 181 by John Heckewelder, a German Moravian mission ary to the Indians, says Dr. Goebel, fur nished the Inspiration and the greater part of the material for "Hiawatha." A BOOSTER OF PROSPERITY. Mr. Harrlataa Fits Action to Opti mist to Preachments. Pittsburg Dlsgatch. Public attention Is likely to center on the prosperity Interview given out by Ed ward H. Harrlman. In Its way It Is unique. If It were not for the fact that Mr. Harrlman has been arranging for large extensions and betterments of his system of western railroads, his outburst might be construed as sarcasm. His works, how ever, prove to the contrary, and his logic concerning the soundness of the country Is absolutely Irrefutable. Because he be lieves what he says, he Is already busy building more railroads to care for the greater business he sees growing In the terrltpry touched by the lines he has con trolled. . There Is one humorous feature that may or may not have been Intended. He de clares the public, having learned there Is "only a rotten spot here andthere," Is again of good heart and ready to go for ward. Mr. Harrlman's Intimate connection with the "rotten epota" disclosed by vari ous offlolal Investigations is quite generally understood. In this instance the public Is permitted to make Its own guess whether Mr. Harrlman means to Ignore those par ticular "rotten spots," or whether It Is his purpose to assure the public that having been found out he la going to mend his ways. ' There Is one thing not to be questioned. Mr. Harrlman Is a master of finance and of affairs. He Is an optimist. He not only talks as one, but he acts like one, and there are fow men In the country whose Judgment of present conditions or of future prospects Is better than his. Tn this aspect there Is no more encourag Ing news possible than the Harrlman out giving. Two tirades of Cmlprlts. Philadelphia Press. The millionaire caught In a trap Is no dif ferent from, the 1 ordinary culprit when nabbed by a policeman. Ha evades, he lies, he shifts his position, he will commit per jury to escape. And the rich scoundrel, like the poor one, will try to cast discredit upon those responsible for his downfall. No. thief e'er felt the halter draw With good opinion of the law. Wa alncersly believe that K per cent of all the banks and big corporations are managed with the utmost fidelity. This grand majority know exactly where to put the blame for every rascally act on the part of the slim minority. And It wlllJ avail the few crooked hlgn financiers noth ing to go on preaching that most Idlotlo doctrine about the White House being re sponsible for their own misdemeanors. The West Haa the Oaods. Bt. Louis Republic. The kind of Jingoism with which wa chal lenge attention in our western attitude to ward everybody eaat.of us means that thsy shall not go hungry if we can have our way, as we think we can. For we've got the corn, we've got the wheat, we've got the bfceon, too. Shooting; Wlthont Caas. Brooklyn Eagle. Several papera that are always too quirk assumed that Senator Dank-la was a gold man and Mr. Bryan a silver man. in 106 and In l0u. When they learned that fr.

SMOOTH-SHAVE: ACJB. Congressional Hettotantes r resent Beardless Fares. Nsw York Tribune. The aspect of the house of representa tives, or of the new mmbers thereof, kn regarded from the gnllrrVS at'tho cspiU'l affords to the physiognomist suugiwllon-of the opportunity whli h awaits' some new Tcufelsdroch to write a Tonsor Retorisuft, which would disclose to the world a new philosophy of whiskers. Thus v might system of chronology be Suggested, In which the various ages of the world and r the severs) stages of civilisation should be distinguished by the then prevalent pat tern of hirsute adornnw-nt of the manly face. ( It will be nay. It was yesterdsy-ob-served by those who looked at the con gressional portrait galltSrjl presented In lifelike halftones In our V"- thit'the present Is primarily the smooth-shaven age. Of tlfe 18 representatives- portrayed, a strong majority of fifty-ejfsh evinced dailf acquaintance with the rror.' and .wltlv the) most extensive application of that Invslua ble Instrument. There were fifty-eight faces, of all sges, and troth aU parts ef the land, entirely devoid sol Vhlskers' in any form; so that each of these statesmen might well say to the delineator of his countenance what Cromwell aiA to the painter, that he should depict him Just aa he was, concealing no blemish and omit ting no wrinkle. Of the minority, by far the major part no fewer than thirty-five were seen to. approximate as closely as possible to the majority by displaying nothing but mus taches, which were with fow exceptions closely cropped. There was srarcely one who ventured to wear a mustache of the kind variously descjlbed-ln Belgravla as the cavalry colonel's mustache and. n Oehkaaoo aa "soup strainers." Aftr these, there were only a few "also ran." Four displayed the combination of mustache and Imperial which was once so much sdinlred. and an equal number th full tint close cropped face covering, Innocent of rasor's touch but familiar with deftly wielded scissors. And finally one mado bold with the same full display uncropped, and one with the combination of mustache and side 'whiskers but shaven chln. , , . . '' What a contrast to a congressional gal lery of years ago! Time was when en tirely bare faces were a smalt minority, and when only the moat daring would have ventured to display merely a mue- ' tache, but when the average chin wore a flowing growth below a cloan shaved upper Up. At other times probably a preponder ance of faces were free as a Naiarlte'S head from tho touch of either raior or shears, while yet again at times smooth shaven chins were flanked 'with all manner of lateral adornments, from "mutton chops" and "Burnsides" to "Dundrearles." Yet they say men care not for these things, confront not the mirror, and are not tha blind followers of fashion that their better halves are. Can It be that there Is Indeed soma profound . esoteric significance In these things? Does the change from full whiskers to mustaches denote some new evolution of statesmanship, the rise of new era upon the world T Truly, there Is occasion .for the coming of the latterday Bage of Weissnichtwo. . -
