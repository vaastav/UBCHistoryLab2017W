ntions. then what becomes of the $125.W*? appropriated for that service In the Treastiry Department? On inquiry, however, we found that when a inan in the secret service js transferred or loaned or detailed the man employed in that service Is no longer paid out of this appropriation." "" No New Oath JTaken. "But I say. notwithstanding he is employed thereafter by another department, paid for by the other department, and is not required to take the oath of office, during all this time, he remains on the rolls of the secret service, is under the control of the chief of the secret service and makes his report to the secret service. "This provision Is not intended as an evidence on the part of the committee of its disapproval so much of the employment of secret service men, wherever they are necessary In other departments, as it is to emphasize our disapproval of the practice of thL* us? of the secret service, which is the most important branch of lhe secret service work of the Government and which 1? limited exclusively to the detection of counterfeiting and the protection of the President. "If this provision prevails the people in the secret service will have their services limited to the object for which the service was created. I will say that the people, employed in that service welcome that provision because it tends to elevate and standardize the service and protects them from the nnrea.?onabrp prejudice that exists throughout the country against the secret service of the Treasury Department. Those people are not opposed to this provision, as we are. to stop the practice that now exists. You will see trom the testimony of Mr. Moran himself that he would be very glad to get rid of the matter of keeping men on the rolls for the purpose of supplying requests of this kind, .whether they deemed the service necessary or not, Tf the departments actually need secret service men hereafter this provision does not interfere with their -obtaining them. They will have the same opportunity then that they have now. They have rto right and cannot Justify the practice, which Ints obtained here for the last few years, of maintaining a larger force than is necessary for secret service w;ork in order to supply men in other departments." Representative Bennet's Remarks. At this point .Representative Bonnet of New York announced that he would make a point of order against the provision. although he sympathized with the efforts of the committee. He thought a certain amount of secret service work had to be done by other departments and that borrowing secret service men was the best way. Then the case, referred to in committee hearings, but expurgated from the printed document, of the naval officer whose conduct while on leave was investigated with the result that he was fired from the navy, was referred to on the floor in general debate, although the names of the parties were not mentioned. "Without telling any names," said Mr. Rennet. "I am ready to state the facts. Here is a case where a naval officer of previous high and irreproachable character. so far as the department knew, was absent on leave. There came to the office of the acting secretary of navy one day a very estimable lady of "Washington, D. C., who charged that gentleman with abducting her daughter. The Secretary of the Navy exhausted the ordinary means within the navy of ascertaining the whereabouts of that officer." "Was not her daughter a married woman?" asked Judge Smith of Iowa. "That makes it worse." replied Mr. Bennett. amid laughter by the House. "But she was a married woman," insisted Judge Smith. "Certainly." said Mr. Bennet. "After the Secretary had exhausted all the means nt his command he called In either one or two secret service men who simply, after a lapse of a few days, reported to the Secretary of the Navy " "A few days of shadowing. I suppose the gentleman means." sarcastically remarked Mr. Smith. "I do not." said Mr. Bennet. "After a few days' investigating to find out where he was. they reported that he was at a certain place, and there their connection with the case ended. The Secretary of the Navy sent for the naval officer and he was subsequently separated from the service." Mr. Sherley Takes a Hand. "Then." suggested Representative Sherley of Kentucky, "whenever a charge is made against an officer, on leave or not on leave, that he has been guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman. the Secretary of the Navy is warranted in employing the secret service men to shadow that man in order to f>rove whether those charges are "Well founded or not?" "Not at all." replied Mr. Bennet, "and 1 do not so state." At this noint Mr. Sherley threw a bomb shell Into the gathering:. The gentlemen." said he, "may be aware of the fact that this secret service , at one time was used for the purpose of looking into the personal conduct of a member of Congress, notwithstanding the gentleman seems to think, from his previous remarks, that they are answerable to no one." *I am not aware of anything of that kind." replied Mr. Bennet. "But that was the fact." said Mr. Staerley. Mr. Smith of Iowa told the House that the secret service division was created by an appropriation in 1882 and. "after certain gross abuses of it, about twentyrive years ago. a provision was put Into the appropriation that it should be used for the enumerated purposes and for no other purposes whatever."

MEETING OF ASSOCIATION Elmer Paine Tells How Judges Came to Decision. OFFICIAL SUPPORT IS CITEI President Neagle Refers to Ad ocscy of Secretary Straus and of Gen. Darlington. Prominent speakers last night before the meeting of the United States Civi Service Retirement Association at ok .Masonic Temple advocated retirement or pension for government employes. Cash prizes offered by the associatior for the best essays on the subject of "Retirement of Civil Service Employes" wert awarded. Enthusiasm was aroused b> the speeches and the announcement ol the winners. Pickens Xeagle, president of the association. told of work done by the organization toward the accomplishment of its purpose, and spoke optimistically upor the possible outcome. He referred to th< recommendation made by Secretary Straus of the Department of Commetvt and Labor in his annual report for 1905 in which he suggested the retirement plar for government clerks. He also referred to Maj. Gen. Darlington, inspector general of the army, recommending the retirement and pensioning of those in the classified service. Others who spoke were Joseph Stewart, second assistant postmaster general: A. B. Hayes, former solicitor of internal revenue, and Elmer E. Paine, a newspaper man. Mr. Paine was one of the board oi judges of the essays offered in the contest and announced the winners from the platform last night. Winners of Frizes. The winners were: First prize, JoO?Joseph F.

Starr, clerk War Department. Seventh prize, $10?Elisha C. Vose. observer United States weather bureau Concord. N. H. , In speaking of the contestants Mr. Paine said: "Every one of them bears evidence oi thought and ability. The judges, to be perfectly frank atout the matter, were somewhat at a loss In the making of the awards of prizes. Among so many papers as were submitted to the board it was a rather difficult task to determine which were the best. "In the consideration of the papers submitted the judges individually examined them. Each judge marked the essays entirely independently of every other judge. When we came together finally to consider our marks and make the awards of prizes* the various estimates were placed by the actuary of the board, Mr. McCoy, in columns. "An exponent, or a weight, of seven was given to the first prize; an exponent of six was given to the second; an exponent of five was given to the third, and so down to the seventh prize. By this arrangement the judges were enabled to reach a conclusion, remarkable as it may seem, of absolute unanimity." People Should Be Educated. Eaudlng the purposes of the association, Mr. Paine said: "For a considerable time I have been interested in the work this association is doing. In the examination of the papers submitted to the board of judges it was evident to a.'I of us that the writers were following along beaten paths in the consideration of this matter of retirement. du uu|jvi uinv wtvci} ctvu Bfrvite employe. "In the view of many of us the time has come when educational influences should be brought to bear to Induce the American people to consent to a civil pension list. Throughout the country strong sentiment exists against the establishment of a civil pension list, but that sentiment exists, I believe, because of a lack of definite information concerning its advantages. "Without committing any member of the board of judges in any way, 1 wish to urge upon the membership of tills association the desirability of working for civil pensions to such an extent as may be entirely proper." Those who served as judges to award the prizes follow: Gen. Robert Shaw Oliver, assistant secretary of war; Charles II. Treat, Treasurer of the l'nited States; Prof. Willis E. Moore, chief of the weather bureau; Mr. Edward H. Moore, commissioner of patents; Elmer K. Paine, Associated Press; Joseph G. McCoy, actuary, Treasury Department, and George R. Wales, assistant chief examiner L'nited States civil service commission. ? In his address Assistant Postmaster General Stewart said it ;s no reflection upon the character or ability of a man when lie enters the government service and doesn't leave it. "It should be to his credit," lie said. "It shows fidelity and loyalty. And such men s.hould be renjembtred by the government for their faithful labors. "I am heartily in favor of the retirement plan and wish it all possible success. Go on witih the movement that has been so strongly started. Keep at your task as though tli? success you are aiming for was already in your grasp."

Mr. Neiss said the North Washington ?

He suggested that the question of suffrage and popular government or the retention of o the present form of government here f, might be submitted to the same test, and ti said he believed a vaat majority of the ~v people would vote for suffrage. v Mr. Oyster submitted a plan for popu- a lar government in the District which he t said he believed would be generally fa- d vored. It provided that in place of the Commissioners there should be a mayor q or governor, five commissioners to be b elected by the people and five to be ap- a pointed by the President of the United n States.

Mr. Clayton and Chairman Shoemaker favored only asking Congress at this time , for a bill granting the District a dele- ? gate in the House of Representatives. They believed full suffrage would coine later with a popular form of District government. Mr. Oyster spoke strongly in favor of his plan. It was never contemplated by 1 the framers of the Declaration of Independence. he said, that Congress should ^ be the common council for the District of ir Columbia, and that the people here should w be deprived of their rights as American h citizens. Mr. Shoemaker said it would be . a mistake to ask for more than a delegate at this time. m The action favoring an election of a o] i delegate was then unanimously adopted. 1 The vote on the proposition favoring the I election of a board of seven commissioners was 7 ayes and 2 nays. bl 1 A vote of thanks was tendered O.

MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. NEW YORK. December 12.?Floyd MacFarland, the veteran bicycle racer of California, won the sixteenth international six-day race for the team of MacFarland and Moran at Madison Square Garden tonight, and set a new distance record. Rutt of the Rutt-Stol German-Holland team finished second and Demara of the DemaraHill combination, the former of California and the latter of Boston, was third. The final sprint of one mile was between the representatives of these three teams, which were on equal term* as to distance covered, the others withdrawing to give them a clear track. The three teama that took part in the^nal dash covered 2,737 miles 1 lap in 142 hours, which is three miles seven laps ahead of the record set by Miller and Waller in 1890. All the riders except MacFarland. Rutt and Demara left the track at 10 o'clock. and one minute later these three riders, who had led the others by one or more laps for the past three days, began the derisive mile. They started at a good clip and sprinted desperately for the last three laps. MacFarland got the lead and finished scarcely five feet ahead of Rutt, who was the same distance ahead of Demara. The money prizes that went to the surviving teams were divided as follows: First, $1,300; second, $1,000; third, $700; fourth. $300; fifth, $300; sixth, $230, and seventh, $200. Great Crowd Sees Finish. Early in the evening an enormous crowd gathered In the big amphitheater to witness the final hours of one of the most keenly contested bicycle races held in the ten years' history of six-day contests. Probably 12,000 persons filled every seat in the garden and crowded every foot of standing room that afforded a view of the ellipse around which the riders of the eight remaining teams steadily circled until the bell sounded for the final sprint between the leaders. As the score stood when the night crowds began to gather it was a virtual certainty that the teams represented in the ' last desperate dash of a mile that Would decide the race and determine the 1006 championship would be the RutiStol, McFarland-Moran and Hill-Demara combinations. Attention was largely centered upon the riders of these teams who were tied for the lead as they wound around the course, warily watching one another for the least sign of an attempt to gain a lap. At the same time the three leaders were constantly on the alert to prevent their nearest rivals, the Walthour-Root team, from gaining the one short tenth of a mile that meant the addition of another man to the list of starters in the deciding mile rush. There were many short sprints during the evening under the inspiration of a big enthusiastic crowd, but all proved fruitless, as there was no change in the relative positions of the teams. During a hard sprint started by Moran, Walthour collided with Demara and both fell, but neither was injured, and no one gained or lost in consequence. Pace Fast From Start. The pace was a fast one front the opening day. Throughout the week almost every succeeding hour showed new records over those established by Miller and Waller In 1S99 and Elkes and MacFarland in 1900. The pace was too fast for several of the teams and they were forced to drop out'under the pressure. Accidents eliminated other combinations. For the past four days, however, the leaders were those of the closing hours. All three pairs showed remarkable staying powers, Rutt and Stol. last year's winners, being picked on form by many from the start, to close in the lead and win out in the sprint. The veteran. McFarland. on a previous winning team, riding with the steady-going Moran, was another strong favorite. Hill and Demara, hitherto unknown to the six-day racing enthusiasts here, won popular approval by clever and game riding. Walthour and Root lost a lap in midweek. and for the last three days they dogged the heels of the leading teams with steady persistence, usinsr everv trick of the cycle track to get upon even terms with the foremost trio.
