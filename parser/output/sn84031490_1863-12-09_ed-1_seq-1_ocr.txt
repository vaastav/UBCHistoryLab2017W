The opposition are appa rently thoroughly demoralized and with out a leader, and, hclcful, and hating ona another, they hare only managed hy their course thus for, in roasting the current of events, to show their own malice and weakness. The people may look for speedy attention to important public measures connected with this war, which will not his time, wc trust, he postponed until the heel of the session. The great Gauds in various departments of public business will, we hope, be exposed with an unsparing hand, and the knife and cautery be freely used. Let a terror tail upon the bloodsuckers that have fastened upon the nation ,to gorge themselves in a season of public trial like this. A Covodc 'investigation should reach and parity all these un&agnmt spots, and make an exam ple of all guilty parties. By all means,dear out the useless Major ■Generals and Brigadier Generals, and those pretty gentlemen, their staff officers. The ■condemned corral of army officers is a xnost expenrive institution, and cannot too soon be emptied. If Little Mac and his fidlpws arc worth anything in shoulder straps, set them at work,or else restore them to civil life. It will save a heavy drain on the public treasury, and open the path for better men to rise. Let the work begin. Ben. Butler again strikes a toy note. The blacks most be used. The war has need of all of them, and Gen. Butler nrges that black and white should bo paid alike. So say the people. And let Congress give such end to legislation on this point. "Wanted, men to kill rebels. Complexion ■of applicants no object No distinctions in pay. The Cliief Quartermaster at SL Louis de serves the thanks ofloyal men. He grasp, cd and strangled a knot of knavish con tractors, put the hay market under military law, secured the Government from rohhety and good prices to the producers tbe while lie brought a soulless gong of knaves to hit ter grief. Head onr St, Louis dispatch. A very numerous delegation from onr regiments in the Held has come home to offer to able bodied men exemption from the draft. There is rro better nor more honorable way to avoid conscription than to face if, musketin hand, and on your cap the battle-honored number of one of our gallant Illinois regiments. That is how to htngh at the Provost Marshal and men. Gold bad on uneasy day of it yesterday fluctuating among tbe fractions, starring at 49, falling off once, and again, recovering, and again receding, at last showing on ad vance of half a cent on the first above flamed rate. •.The S3OO clause will doubtless be re pealed, and with the amendment, Congress should secure others, looking to a classifi cation of citizens, a discrimination in favor of men of family, the admission of blacks to full pay and light to serve as substitutes. Tbe people hare outlived squeamishness. They wish the war finished up. They care not whether black aims or white push -home the bayonets. Let aH bimezs of prejudice be removed- Let us have an ar my as the result of this dratij whose full jutmbers will strike mortal terror through the lean Confederacy and whose force will ~be irresistible to sweep rebellion from the land. The Richmond papers, ns evidenced else where, are in deep depression and* will not Be comforted. Their doleful damps are all the worse in'being well based, with darker .days to come. The Army of the Potomac is doubtless to have a new deader, bat no announce ments hare been made. If loyalty was all that was needed, Meade is not to be sur passed- It confidence of people and army were all, then McClellan would have need ed no successor. ‘What is demanded and waited for in a leader of the Potomac Army, is euccess, and the qualities that go to make it, are as rare as the task is grave, land the reward shining.' General Brajnum. A. few days onr dispatches announced the arrest of Brig. Gen. Mason Brayman of tiii« State, in command at Comp Chase, Co lumbus, Ohio. No explanations were given, but the many friends of this excellent officer have in Ms behalf confidently awaited some further details. The following letter from Gen, Brayman sets the whole matter at rest and relieves Mm of a charge that would be grave were it not ridiculous: T?y>-n Quarters. CaupDesxibok, o-» I - December 8,15G3. f 31 Gears. Editors Mv experience In early life, oe a journalist, sug gest* the many ways in which erroneous etato xnenta find their way into the newspapers. Of Jhia character are the paragraphs found in the papers of the past few days, announcing me as haviuabcco under arrest, removed from my command, ordered to report to a court-mar i«l. A c. one paper kindly attributes the charges against me to ‘‘personal controversy.’’ My military life has thus far been wholly free—ls now free, and will, I trust, remain free from personal controver sies. In the wav of official duty, 1 have a contro versy with rebels and their sympathizers cvery- On assuming command at this post, I found se rious complaints existing against persons In hos- SUal employment, for disloyalty, theft and other 1 Borders. "I undertook to secure an investigation and a remedy. „ , . The very trifling charges preferred against me, arc recognized as -one of the ways adopted to de feat a neoessarr inquiry into these abuses, I was kindly furnished a copy of these charges; but was not arrested, removed from command, ordered to report, nor asked to explain. On making inquiry. I was advised that a court, had been called, dissolved, and all papers or dered to Washington. That Is all. The effort to defeat investigation proves its necessity. That those who know and respect me may not be misled, I respectfully request the loyal papers to publish *ht* note. M. BnaratAX, Brigadier General Volunteers. FROM THE SOUTH. New Tore, Dee. B.—The Richmond Whig of the 3d lost., titika in the following plain fahsion With no other motive or thought than lo advance the public interest, we would tignin suggest to the President the advantage of reconstructing his Cabinet, and calling to his aid the very ablcstintcllecU of the coun try. Wc have a department of state that has not able for nearly three years to establish anyTclations with any other State. A Treasury Department that has failed to keep Us finances from running .to ruin. A War Department in the hand of a chief whose studies and course of life has been purely and peculiarly civic. A Navy Department without a navy. A Post Office Department, with a very shocking system of mails. A Department of Justice vacant The business of each department separately shows the wont of a more master! v hand, and the pow ers of their chiefs in Cabinet councils, if councils arc ever held, fail to supply the quantum of wisdom the country needs. We are getting in too deep waters, and a feeling of dread Is shaking the souls of the people. There is nothing the President can do unit will so reanimate their hearts and eliminate their confidence in affection for him ns the calling to his side as his daily ad visers, a cabinet of the wisest, truest and most experienced men in the country, re gardless of what may have been their former political associations. • The time Is propitious. The occasion ur gent, and the people anxiously expectant, and for his own continuing complicity for useful ness and future fame, us well as on account •of the sorely ncceaslUouß and exigent condi tion of the country, we earnestly press this recommendation.

On their way back with Ms family,-when within ten miles of the lowa State line, and camped for the night, they were attacked by a party of about fifteen pro-slavery radians. The colored man escaped to the brush, bearing one of the ruffians say to Ms companions, “Damn yon, yon won’t ran off any more,* and simultaneously three pistol shots were fired. The colored man returned home and told the story, and a detachment of home guards left Indianola yesterday for the bor der to investigate the mutter.

Several days ago the Secretary of tbc Union Merchant’s Exchange, J. H. Alexander, ad dressed a remonstrance to Gen. Allen, chief Quartermaster .of the West, against the threatened slrnrc of hay, unless the Govern ment was freely supplied by dealers at $33.00 per ton. The response of Gen. Allen is a scathing exposure of the combination of speculators, who endeavored to swindle the producers and impose on the Government, by running np the price fifty per cent, in less than a fortnight The General says that he did not contem plate forcible impressment, but that the order Los nevertheless worked well in bring ing to Ms notice vast quantities of hay on the OMo River and elsewhere, offered to Mm at the price fixed by the advertisement He has in Ms grasp already, CO,OOO tons of hay, sufficient to supply the armies of the West forAlx months.* This fact shows very con clusively that the speculators are defeated. * Mrs. Trnstcn Polk and family left here by permission of the Provost Marshal, this af ternoon, for Sandusky, to visit her husband a prisoner of war, ill in that place.

The Democrats displayed the some state of disorganization to-day, on the election of other officers, as they did yesterday on the Speakership. They made our renegade and cast-off Clerk (Etheridge) tbeln candidate, but some of their number refused to vote for him; while, for other offices, they could not unite their strength on any one candi date. They tried the game of nominating out hoping to get some of his former friends to vote for him, and so run. him In, but Mr. Ball was too good a Union man to permit himself to be used in that way, and promptly demanded the withdraw- • el of his name. The Senate unceremoniously kicked out Wilson, of Missouri, who Is trying to hold on to the place to which Gratz Brown has been elected. * .. The Committees of the House will not be announced tmtil next Monday. The pressure ou the Speaker for eligible places is tremcn duona.

This report embraces 30 pages, and begins with the blockade. The extent of the block aded coast is 3,549 miles, with 189 harbor mid river openings, and much of the coast presents a double shore to be guarded. In addition to the blockading fleet, more than one hundred vessels have been employed in patrolling the rivers. The distance patrolled on the Mississippi and its tributaries is 5,G55 miles. On the Gulf and the Atlantic, 2,000 miles of sounds, rivers and inlets, have also been penetrated and watched with un ceasing vigilance. The blockade is becoming more effective and complete. There has been progress in repelling the rebels from the coast. The un principled traders who successfully violated law and public morality in illicit traffic with the rebels during the early part of the war, have found their operations daring the past year most disastrous. Admiral Leo continues to command the North Atlantic Squadron. ThcMghest enco miums are passed on the naval officers as men of sleepless vigilance and bravery. It is not known that any vessels elude the vigilance of the South Atlantic Squadron, More than a year ago operations were com menced with a view of interdicting all traffic, and if possible of capturing Charleston itself; but by reason of delays and difficulties in lilting out the iron-clad fleet, a demonstra tion was not made till the the 7th of April. A Mstory of the operations before Charleston is then given. The Secretary then alludes to the conflict that took place in Warsaw Sound, between the Wcchawkcn and the Atlanta, and con dudes that tMs remarkable result was on ad ditional testimony in favor of the monitor class of vessels for harbor defense and coast service, against any navy vessels that have been or are likely to be constructed to visit onr shores. It appears to have extinguished whatever lingering hopes the rebels may have had of withstanding our naval power by naval weapons. . ' * ‘ Admiral Bailey continues to command the Eastern Gulf squadron. Then follows a his tory of the Southern Gulf squadron under Admiral Farragnt. Had a land force been in readiness to co-operate with the fleet Vicks burg could have been captured alter the oc cupation of New Orleans. The blockade of the Gnlfis satisfactory, and recently the reb el traffic through Matamoras has become in significant slice the capture of Browns ville. Admiral Portci', in command of the Missis sippi squadron, is complimented as an officer of great energy and extraordinary vigor. It’ is but a little over two years since wo. had not a naval vessel on all the Western waters. . Now we. have a hundred vessels carrying 463 guns and 5,500 men. Commodore Harwood commands a flotilla on the Potomac to intercept the illicit traffic between Maryland and Virginia. Admiral Charles H.

Mr. Lincoln is very much better. New Yobk, May B.— This commanding offi cers of the U. 8. steamers Reliance and Sat ellite, nunjfd Walters and Robinson, are dis missed from* the navy for dereliction of duty in being unprepared for attack. Washington, Dec. B.—The President will not send in his message till to-morrow often noon. Mr. McPherson was nominated for Cleric of the Bouse, at the Union omens lost evening, receiving fifty-five votes against forty-four for Mr. Buffington. On* the re assembling of the Honse at noou to-day, Mr. McPherson ■was duly elected Clerk, and Mr. Ordway, Sergeant-at-Anns. New Yobe, Dec. B.—-The New York Tribune's 'Washington special says: Although the President’s Message is ready, it is proba ble that it will not be sent to Congress be fore 'Wednesday, as there is considerable doubt whether the Honse will be ready to receive it before two or three o’clock to toOlxow, by ‘which time the very, likely have adjourned. The most Important and interesting portions of the Message, are those which deal with the subject of slavery and the restoration to the Union of States that have been in rebellion. In what the President says regarding the former topic, he considers the Emancipation Proclamation as an accomplished tact: He holds that the Proclamation has liberated all the slaves within the territory which it embraces, and all futnre action must be based upon that supposition. In a word the President docs not and will not adopt the policy which fails to give a slave a vested right in himself. The plan Mr. Lincoln proposes for the restoration of the loyal people of truant States to their former position in the Union, Is represented to be purely his own,. and unlike anj now before the public. Not confining himself to general outlines, he en ters with some minuteness into details. In nnotber part of the Message the President alludes to the victories gained daring the Jear over the rebels, and dwells at some ength upon the progress and present aspect and prospects of the war. '“The bill creating the office of Lientenant General, of which notice was given to-day by Mr. Washbnrnc, of HI., is intended to give Gen. Grant the position to which his talents and his victories arc generally thought to entitle him.”- The Washington special of the New York ■ Tines says: Chase’s report will be transmitted by special messenger to the Northern press to-morrow. He adopts all the recommendations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in regard to whisky and tobacco, and suggests the propriety of a still further increase of the tax on those arti cles, in order that the revenue may be in creased, as it has fallen considerably below the estimates of the framers of the law. The receipts from this source for the last year will fall short of $60,000,000. “Moj.-Gen, French has been relieved from his command in tbo Army of the Potomac and placed under arrest. His arrest is pre liminary to charges of misconduct in the recent affair at Mine Run. “By a general order officers commanding divisions, brigades and detached regiments, serving In tins department, will hereafter he held responsible that their respective com mands arc in readiness to take the field with reasonable promptness after receiving march ing orders;

Mr. FESSENDEN of Maine objected on tircly to recognizing Mr. Wilson in any way as a senator from Missouri. "hit. McDOUGAL of Col. said the law of the question Imd been settled, and as the friend of the gentleman from Missouri, he was borrv ho thought ho had & claim. air. POWELL of Kentucky thought that the whole question depended on the fact whether the Legislature of Missouri hod really adjourned sine t/i>, or only took a recess before coming to gether lately and electing a Senator. If the Legislature of Missouri adjourned without electing a Senator, the appointment of the Government held good until the pro per assembly of the Legislature and election by that body. It had been said, however, that the Legislature only took a recess. Ho would therefore like to have the Judiciary Committee Inquire into the facta. Mr. TRUMBULL of Illinois moved to amend the resolution by declaring Wilson was not entitled to a seat in the Senate. Mr. WILSON, of Moss., gave notice of a bill to Increase the bounty lor volunteering, and to make an appropriation for the same. The amendment of TRUMBULL was agreed to and the resolution adopted.
