PRESIIIEXTS MESSAGE President Tafts annual message to Congress was read before Senate and House Tuesday afternoon It Is a care ful review of his stewardship during the last twelve months and gives an interesting outline of his plans and pur poses with reference to various admin istration activities The message has made a better impression probably than any other communication that Mr Taft as President has forwarded to the legislative department of the Govern ment His attitude on many topics which he covers is already fairly well under stood but he treats these with infor mation that Is fresh and up-to-date He declares strongly for tariff revision schedule by schedule whenever the Tariff Board completes its investiga tions and Is ready to report That will not be however he says at the present session of Congress Ho urges further conservation legislation strong ly along the line of his St Paul ad dress A ship subsidj enactment for South American lines is mentioned as deserving Immediate attention The message opens with extended ref erence to the triumphs of arbitration The President says the year lias been notable as witnessing the pacific set tlement of two Important international controversies before the permanent court of the Hague In discussing the Fisheries arbitration there the Presi dent writes that he would be wanting in proper recognition of a great patri otic service if he did not refer to the lucid historical analj sis of the facts and the signal ability and force of ar gument six days in length presented to tho court in support of our case by Mr Eliliu Root He recommends the ratification of a protocol to strengthen the Prize Court Convention states that he has not ap pointed Peace Commissioners because he Is waiting for foreign governments to express a willingness to co operate and dwells upon the Importance of treaties negotiated with Great Britain during the past j ear In reviewing tho countrys diplomatic relations he mentions tho negotiations for the Hukuang loan to the Chinese Government and negotiations between the Chinese Government and American bankers for a loan of 50000000 to be employed chiefly in currency re form The President saj s the Gov ernments policy ha3 been directed by a desire to make use of American capi tal in the development of China and an instrument in the promotion of Chinas welfare and material prosper ity Considerable space is devoted to Latin American topics suchas the celebration by southern Republics of their one- hundredth annlvorsary the Fourth Pan tile boundary dispute between Peru and Eucador the Mexican Boundary Com mission the arrangement of the public dcht of Honduras and the internecine struggle in Nicaragua Tho President says the moderation and conciliatory spirit shown by various factions givo ground for tho confident hope that Nicaragua will soon take Its rightful place among the law abiding and pro gressive countries of the world Ho announces with gratification the fact that Argentina some months ago placed with American manufacturers the contract to build two battleships The tariff settlements with various countries under the maximum and prompt action be taken to establish di rect lines of communication by ships to Latin America the completion of the Panama Canal will find this tho only great commercial nation unable to avail in international maritime

for congress comprise a total of 3G0 49401312 which is 529C48S73C less than the appropriations voted at the last session of Congress The President advocates changes In the business methods of the Treasury Department which require legislation to be made effective The auditing sys tem in vogue he says is as old as the Government and the methods used are antiquated He would change the organization of customs districts and favors abolishing several customs offices The cost of collecting 1 at tho port of York Maine the President states is 5004 at Annapolis Md 30941 at Alexandria Va 12249 Tho Secre tary of the Treasury has abolished 400 places in tho Civil Service without at all injuring its efflciencj The President recommends some method for controlling the supply of public buildings so that they will harmonize with the actual needs of the Government He saj s hi approved of the last Public Building bill for the same reason that heapproved the last River and Harbor bill because of the many good features It contained but he is convinced that it was drawn upon a principle that ought to be abandoned He urges that future public building bills be prepared on a report by a American Conference at Buenos Aires Commission of Government oxperts us I s to the needs ot various localities for publlcbuildiiig -facilities just as he is urging the preparation of River and Harbor bills on a similar report by at my engineers The paragraph on the Payne tariff act was scrutinized with exceptional interest at the Capitol because of the uromiffe of that law as an issue in cur rent politics The schedules of the rates of duty in the Payne tariff act the President writes have been sub jected a great deal of criticism some of it just more of it unfounded and to much misrepresentation He sajs that little if any of the criticism of the tariff has been directed against the pro tective principle but the main body of the criticism has been based on the charge that the attempt to conform to the measure of protection was not hon estly and sincerely adhered to The time in which the tarilf was prepared undoubtedly was so short as to make it impossible for the Congress and its ex perts to acquire the information neces sary strictly to conform to the declared measure He then details the work of the Tnrlft Board to develop the In formation now required The method of impartial scientific study by experts as a preliminary to legislation which the Prosident wants adopted with reference to tariff pub lic buildings and river and harbor im provements lie also urges in consid eration of our banking and currency sjsten He sas the problem is not partisan is not sectional It Is national The President rccommondB a com mission to determine as early as prac ticable a

urgent recommen dation of last year for an Injunction bill Postmaster General Hitchcock is praised for his achievements In econo mizing the expenditures of the postal service which have gone for toward wiping out the annual deficit The ex tension of Uici classified service the re minimum provision of the Payne law I 1 awl voted men who fought to save the life were made the President sa s with marked advantage to tho commerce of the United States The negotiations with Canada in that connection he udds have been followed by a further discussion of the commercial Interests of the two countries to obtain a sat isfactory basis for a trade arrangement which offers the prospect of a freer in terchauge for tho products of the two countreis Tiiesc conferences will be resumed at Washington next mouth The President points out that unless striction of- tho franking privilege and other rcformsaccomplUhed or proposed art taken up The President recom mends parcels post on rural

on Industrial Insurance to be held in Washington in 1913 a Bureau of Health and tho establishment of a Govern ment park on the Virginia side of tho Potomac within territory that originally was part of tho District of Columbia are included In numerous other recom mendations of the message The paragraph about pensions reads as follows The uniform policy of tho Government in the matter of grant ing pensions to those gallant and le of the Nation in the parilous days of the great civil war has always been of the most liberal character Those men are now rapidly passing The best obtainable official statistics show that they are dying at the rate of something over 3000 a month and in view of their advancing years this rate must inevitably in proportion rapidly increase To the man who risked everjthing on the field of battle to save the Nation in the hour of its direst need wo owe a debt which has not been and should not be computed in a begrudging or parsimonious spirit But while we should be actuated by the spirit to the soldier himself care should be exercised not to go to ab surd lengths or distribute the bountj of the Government to classes of per sons who- may at tills late daj from a mere mercenary motive seek to ob tain some legal relation with an old vet5ran ntfwj tottering on tho brink of thCpgravc The true spirit of the pen sion laws is to bo found In the noble sentiments expressed bj Mr Lincoln in his Jast initigural address wherein in spiaUing of the Nations dutj to its soldiers when the struggle sliould be ovr he said we should care for him whjO shall itiave borncthe battle and for 111s wiuuvv anu urpnaus 1 m - The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals that Spencer P Shotter must paj a linear 5000 and spend three months in jail and that J P c Myers must pay 2000 and bo imprisoned throe months has a tang to It sharper than usual in criminal court proceed ings This comes from the fact that these gentlemen are the head of the great Turpentine Trust They would have taken the heavy lines with a grin as meaning unMiuto less or an abridg ment of a European trip But three months in jail That has a clammy heart grip that no Iocs of money could produce It spells loss of social status a fmzzling of business reputation A man emerges from jail with his stand ing in tho community rickety and tot tering It will take tho rest of his llfo to mako pcoplo forget that he was once a common criminal A 

HISTORY OF TEXAS Col Theodore Roosevelt Is to write a comprehensive history of the State of Texas and make it a work worthy of that great State Tiiere are a great many episodes in the of Texns which would make interesting reading For example the attempt of the Eng lish to establish there a German on tho model of those which existed in Germany before the consoli dation of the Empire A Prlncelet was sent over who established his court at Sophlenburg where he had his palace liis theater and his bodyguard The idea of England at the time was to make Texas a buffer Stato between the United States and Mexico A great many Germans were sent over but they found their Prince an expensive luxury enlirelj unnecessary- to a pioneer com munity and he was fired back to his native land The Texan war for inde pendence was a brilliant episode with a great deal of hard fighting some massacres and some decisive victories The way some lobbyists In Washington managed to saddle the Texas bonds and other obligations upon the United States Treasury wlll be an interesting reminder that graft was a good deal worse 75 years ago than it is to day Col Roosevelt will find in Sam Houston a man after his own heart one of un flinching courage of high determina tion and who manfully breasted the wave ofysecrsslon until he was over throw n by it The storj of Gen Twiggss surrender of very nearly half of the United States Army to the Texas Se cessionists will be one of the most un pleasant chapters that the Colonel will have to deal with THE NEW MEAICO CONSTITUTION The New Mexico Constitutional Con

Tribune do not take the paper and rarely see it They are ignor ant of the features in it which have made it so attractive to its half million weekly readers and gathered around it the most devoted friends that any paper in the United States rejoices in Thcso critics are so wrapped up in themselves and their superior merits in crushing the rebellion that they have no interest In what others did The most of the men who are attacking St Cloud never saw the place and prefer to believe or pretend to believe the slanders of some blackmailer rather than accept the statements of hundreds of good
