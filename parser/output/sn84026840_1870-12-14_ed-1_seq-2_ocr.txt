To reach this happy result they count Missouri, Arkansas and Con necticut as Democratic States. Now that 00,000 Democrats are enfranchised in Missouri, it does look as if it would be Democratic.

TIIE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. This document, credited to Grant, was read to Congress at its opening on Mon day la?t, and published in the paper* of Tuesday. It is rather lengthy. We cannot soy the Messngo contains much originality, it bei?g made up, in a great measure, with bare assertion* with which the people are very fuiniliar. We are forcibly strack with that portion of the Message which refers to the Southern States, wherein Grant says "the verdict of the people has been reversed in some of the states lately in rebellion, by vio lence and intimidation." This if certain ly true in one bensc ; for initance, South Carolina, where the uegroes carried the atate by a large majority, thus proving that "the verdict of the people had buen reverted/' What cau9cd this result? A radical Congress enfranchised the ne gro and dihfrancuistd the white man The President and the Administration arc welcome to all the glory caused by this reversion. On tbe other band, wo ask the President to look for a moment at the verdict of the people in many of the Plate* which held their?lection* in Octo ber last. This verdict was certainly not very complimentary to the President or bis administration. A few more such such verdicts will result in a ohange of jnrticfl at the White House. In reading the Message, we fail to Bee anything calculated to gladden tbo hearts of a InX'Mkn people. Not a word from lirnnt in relation to amnesty, thus pro ving that the Administration, like the radical party ef Weal Virginia, foolishly *\pectJi to go in n lease of powtr by pur i cinjr a jrofiriptivc nurse.-?

LEGISLATURE. What Can l>e Done and wliat Should be Dour, Id our former article, we considered the several proposition which have been made for the enfranchisement of those of onr citizens who are now prevented from ex ercising the right of suffrage, and an nounced our preference for a State Con vention. The length of the article pre vented us from giving our reasons for this preference at length, and we now propose to do so. First, A Convention will accomplish all that it cluimed by the friends of the other measures, and iu such a manner as can never be hereafter questioned. A Convention assembled in pursuance of the Constitution, represents the sover eignty of the People, and its power is on ly limited by the Federal compact, which provides that "the powers not delegated to the United States, nor prohibited by it to the States, arc reserved to the States respectively;" and, therefore, a Conven tion can exercise any and all powers not specifically delegated to the Federal Gov ernment. This being tbecann it will not, for a moment, be seriously contended that a Convention could not, by its action, en franchise every man in the State; but, upon the contrary, it is conceded, t*#at a Convention would form a new Coostitu tion, from which would be stripped. n??i only the odious feature of disfranchise ment. but many provinuiiH which liavc been found to be unnecessary and burden some; and when ratified by the peoph, it becomes the fundamental law of the State, and cannot be altered or changed except by Amendment. No legislation can effort it, for it will bo the sourcc of legislative authority. It will be the act of the people, in their sovereign capacity, excrcising '.be inherent right of self-government, ami being ordained by them, can only be al tered, changcd or revoked by the same authority which created it?the People! llut suppose the Amendment of J SCO in simply dinregsrded by the present Leg islature. and onr election laws made to conform to the Constitution an it was be fore its pretended ratification, and what is the result? We at once Javourselves open to the charge of nullifying the Con stitution and of being revolutionary! Whether true or faUe. it makes little dif ference so far a? the effect is concerned \Yc would shock the sense Of the people, and the result would at leant be danger ous to our supremacy as a party. The Amendment would have all the force it ever had, and a subsequent Legislature would have the saute right to enforce its provision* as have had iHoro in the past. So in regard to the repeal of the Kegistrs tion Law What one Legislature would repeal, the lucceeding one could re-enact, and enfranchisement or disfranchisement would depend upon the political complex ion of the Legislature. Hut again : Suppose the Flick Amend ment should be adopted, what would be the result ? Would enfranchisement fol low ? He think not; and that result would, at leant, be questionable. Scctioo :2, of Article l'J, of tb? Con stitution, relative to Amendments, pro vides that "any Amendment tn the Con stitution of tho State may be proposed in either branch cf the Legislature ; and if the same, being read on ihreo several days in each branch, be sgret-d to, on its third reading, by a majority of the mem bers elected thereto, the propped Amend ment, with the ytas and nays thereon, shall be entered on the journals, Mid re ferred to the Legislature at the first ses sion to be held after th* nfjt grwrnl eler tion ; and shall be ])ubli*hrt{, at leapt three month* before such elti tv*n, in serine ncics paper in every county in irhich a immpr. per it printed This provision is plain and mandatory. Every Amendment "shall be published at least three months before such dcction." This hat not bern done! Governor j Stevenson negWted, for what purpose, 1 we do not know, to have the proposed Amendment inserted in any jxijur in the State, until it wan imjwrihle to comply ! with this plain requirement, by reason of lack of time, and it irnt vot ptdJitludfor three month" prior to the last general elec tion ! An a legal preposition, we believe it is conceded that to amend the Constitution in any other way than by a Convention, every requisition vhieh indemnified by the instrument itself, Jic.rr be obsbuvkh, and the vmi$sion of /*T one i? vatal to tiik Amendment ! This view ia expressly sustained by the aithorities which we quoted last week, viz: G Curbing 573; State tf MclJride 4. Me. 303; Collier vs. Frierson, 24, Ala. 1U0. The Legislature might just as well, and with the same propriety, could dinpeusc with tho secood passage by it of any pro posed Amendment, as to dispense witb its publication. The one is just as necessary us the other, 'ihe language is just u? explicit, the requirement is ju6t as strong ' in one case as in the other, and compli ance just as necessary. Upon thin sub ject we again quote from Cooley on Con stitutional limitations, pp. SI. Tho learned writer thrro says: "We scarcely deein ony argument nec tary to enforce this proposition. Tho CrtiPtirutioo is tbet-uprcme and paramount lair. Tbc mode by which auKu-Jincuts ar? ?? ? i- !*.*?? ???" -w MjiMitMCtmnm ?o be made under it is clearly JetincJ. It has been said certain acta nro to bo done, certain requisitions are tobe obvrved. be fore a change can be alFectcd. l>?t to what purpose aru those acts required or those requisitions enjoined, if the fsaislnturc or any department of the government r?f. (iiftjtenrc irith them ? To do *o would be to violate the instrument they are sworn to support, and every principle of public law and sound constitutional policy reiuiret. the courts to pronounce against any amend ment which is not cbcwu to have been made in accordance with the rules pr - scribed by the fundamental law." Thii is the legal aspect oftbcea.?e: and whether our position is corrector not. iu view of the past. trould it U safe to trust to a Judiciary which ha? neural place wholly as a rtvardfor.partizan ser vice, to decide that the omission was intf fatal ? Experience has taught us that our Judges will go far, very-far. in order to minister to'the base ends of pariy ; and in such a matter a. ti.in. involving, an it does, the liberty of more thin 20.000 o: our citizens, we would prefer to leave nothing to inference, or to the interpre tation of purtizan Judpes. kKo cuii imlii ho]* to h>Jtl their pofitioii* hy cohtinmd di?fninrhitem*lit ! Their decision, in our miud. would not Ik; questionable. They would, as in the past, decide jtiat as ilie tia*ccwties ?f their party required, and would declare th* Atnsndio^nt void. Thii: is our opinion; and whether it be right or wrong. submit: that when thare is a remedy for disfranchisement which is open to none -.f the objections that can be urged against tlii* measure, is it not *ne, in it not prudent, to pursue that eoursc? We think so, and, therefore, ??ur necond rep son f-.r preferring u Convention ii:? That it will acecmplish the end sought ?enfranchisement?-in a mariner so en tirely legal and proper, ns to be open to none of the objections tlist can be urged against the other propositions. The right of the people to alter or change their Constitution, is iiheretit.and the remedy we favor for the evils which j uow inflict the body politic, is one that, ii.-is been exercised by communities from i time immemorial. It is the legitimate j and proper method of amending Consti- j totioUH; for as they were formed by the, people in the exercise of their sovereign rights, io should they be changed Our third reason for favoring a Con- < vention is:? That by it enfranchisement ran be ob tained without even a qaati endorsement of Negro Suffrage, or a legalization of the uncouotitutional legislation by which it was forcrd up jtj ms, and consequently without sacrifice of principle. An we discugsed this question somewhat ut length in our former article, we do uot wish to reiterate our argument*: hat it seems to u* that when nu object rati ho ob tained, legally am! properly, without en dorsing legislation which the Democracy have never ceased to denonoce asuncon Mitutional, revolutionary aud outiagcou*, it ip the duty of the party to use those means which are eonsistant with the prin ciple* it represents The Democratic party is a law-abiding party. It is more than that?it is a party of Princiit.K. All the victories it has won. all tin glory it has achieved.all the pood it has accomplished, hn? been by a strict adfcr?reiioe to its prin ciple? ; and we arc one of tliosa who be lieve that all the hopes it h>ig of future victory, of future gloiy and offuture good, depend upon a strict ndbnr nee to princi ple. We believe thin, an firmly as we do in our existence. Nothing was ev^r gained by a sacrifice of principle, but everything that ha* been lost, hna be* n lost by truck* ling to the dictatw* of "policy." The campaign which realised so gloriously for us in this State, was mado on the i**uc that *>egro Suffrage lias tarn forciblv and illegally forced upon our people. Kvery ?Democratic speaker ne heard aid every Democratic paper we read took thi? por tion. The eampaigu w??* bold and ag grcasive. arid it ?/?<*.?*?# +?>*/rlHad the timid, foolish counsel* ?fwould-b^-leiiders been followed, and ) ad we treated llie XVth Amendment an?: Xepro Suffrage as "accomplished facts.,r w* would have lit le difficulty in deciding whut wonM now be the proper course for the Democracy to pursue, for we would Ihv<? been buried deep in a political tomb. We opposen?w. as we have ever opposed, any actiou on the part of the Democracy which even .vjuihIh at u tecocpiiiion of the unconstitu tional measures to which we have alluded. We are dealing with a party which is vi olently tearing away, one after another, every pillar iu the temple of Liberty, and yet wc arb counselled that wo must not resist their acid, that they are "dead is sues " and that it is useless to fightagaiust ! e "inevitable." Such coun?#U are tint befitting statesmen or patriots. A true r.nd wine leadership Merer admits any prin ciple of junice and liberty to be a "dead ihhDe," i.ut upon the contrary. it points to the ruiu wbicii has been wrought, and cries aloud, uud spares uot, until the evil* are corrected and the liberties of th? people secured. Xcgro Sujfrajc t's uot a "dad ittui." No issue is evar "dead" which : carries in its bowels a great and saared principle! .Sercn-tanth* of the white pco pie of the United States arc utterly and profoundly opposed to it; and how, in the name of all the gods at wee, cap any i? suc be "dead," bor cau it be a "fixed fact," when this is the case i l)o geutlo-1 men suppose that seventh-tenths u? oar, citizens will forever consent to have their opinions disregarded and their righto' trampled under foot by the other three-, tenths? Nay, verily. They will net al ways kiss the hand that smites them ; and ' so Mire as there is a God in Israel, the right* and dignity ol the white race will be averted and maintained,and for b? who (ilinll stand iu the way, it were Utter that the oarth had swallowed him up! Hut some gentlemen go so far as to say that r. Convention, if assembled. would U c"mj>ellnl to leave the word "white" out ofj any Constitution they might frame. This i we denv. The right to regulate its own : internal affairs by a State is on# reserved expressly in the Federal compact. Article; X of which reads as follows: "The now . ers not delegated to the lTnited States. \ y the Constitution, nor prohibited by it toi the Stares, arc reserved to the Stales rc> pectively, or to the people." It is a right; that never was "delegated" to the Federal j ' government, and has been exercised by (the States from the formation of the G*v ernmcnt to tho present time ; and all th?* leghdati.m in the world cannot t*ke tt ,away from tho States without their rcn ' b?'ul.

The right of local h*df-jjoverti * ; merit ifl one that w.is never so granted ; | and, consequently, a Convention which frame* u new Constitution for this State, hart a right to huj whether the word ??white" ."hall be placed therein or not. Bat* Convention will not only i;ive ns enfranchisement in a legal and constitu ; tional manner, without sacrificing priuc? pic, but it will remedy existing cvila which could not bo reachod by any other ? means. That this is true, every one will con cede; ami the l'arkersbur;; the ? ablest advocate of thu "Flick" Amend ment, is also the advocate of a Conveii I tion. One of the mast jcrious evil# under which we now Nbor in a j artisan Jndi eiury.
