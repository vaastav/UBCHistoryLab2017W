In addition to this, the currency few doubt the eventual passage of a wisely constructed measure with the minimum of delay. Broadly speaking there remain only the necessary amendments to the anti-trust law, but these are not likely to be very radical. The President will pursue this question before Congress and make it the subject of a subse quent address, but he has written the message exactly as a trained mariner would navigate his ship with an eye of tedious details with which it had become the fashion to load down a Presidential message. The President, we think, has taken a hint from the newspapers and has "featured" his communication to Congress, thus con centrating legislative and public at tention at the beginning of the ses sion on the essentiality great things.

Interestingly Written. More people will read Mr. Wilson's message than any other Presidential utterance delivered on a similar occa Mon for many years, because of its brevity. The President is interesting in his view of the Mexican situation. He believes that the work of isolation is gradually destroying Huerta. In dis cussing the dictator, he says: "Little by little 'he has been com pletely isolated. By a little every day his power and prestige are crumbling and the collapse is not far away. We shall not, I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting. And It is therefore to the spirit of the message more than to the matter that the country may look for reassurance. Coincidentally, going to outside saurces, we find those who most ve hemently incited the President in his efforts against capital now advocating the shortening of sail. We would not say the President is shortening sail. We should say that he is preparing to lower sail, to drop anchor in a safe harbor at the end of the first successful voyage.

President Wilson's message read to Congress yesterday departs from precedent in many pleasing ways. It is scshort that it will be read, and so earnest that it will compel attention.

In most conservative language Mr. Wilson has delivered a radical address is but the start of a movement that will no doubt be taken up by every fraternal organization.

It indicated the deep impression which Mr. Wilson's course has made upon those who have been most narrowly observing him, and have been most closely in contact with him, in Wash ington. It is an impression, too, which is undoubtedly shared by th country. Whether people like Presi- " iuh vi uui anu approve or disapprove of his policies, they can Mr. Taft and Colonel Roosevelt and see how many of them had the su preme gift of control over utterance. Now comes this academic person who is generally believed and whom we ourselves solemnly believe to be capable, if he thought duty required, of oratorical protraction to an extent that would make Roosevelt seem con cise and Taft laconic.
