In 'pursuance to the CoDstitution ol the Cnitcd States, Conirresa met yester .d j.t, it being the first Monday of Decem ber, when the President's message was delivered to the Senate and House of Representatives. The .President con gratulate! the nation upon the general peace and profperity of the past year. It is to be regretted, says he, that a free exercise of the elective franchise has. by Tiolence and intimidation, been denied to citizenj in exceptional cases in 4 eral of the Suites lately in rebellion, and the verdict of the people has thereby been reversed. The President tails to particularize in this matter, but the public are well enough informed to know that, when ties rases kare arisen, the Administration U reposit" for them, and the unfortunates were those of os ?TuO are characterized as dis loyal during the late war.

God save the mark, since Congress and the President are the tyrants that sit upon the liberties of the people, to dis pose of them as seems best not for the general good of the people, but for the interest of the Republican party. We think with the President that it would not be well at present to impose our in stitutions upcu the inhabitants of other countries, at least until republi canism has been once more re stored to our own country. The President still adheres to his Cuban policy of refusing to recognize the bel ligerency of the insurgents. He still - harps upon the annexation of San Do mingo to the United States by treaty, and, although the Senate, at its last ses sion, refused to confirm that treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, still he was, and is yet, convinced that the best interests of the country, commercially and materially, demand it ratification. Sumner and other Senators did not see things through Grant's glasses, and was firm io opposition to this pet measure of the Administration. The message is auite lengthy on this subject, and the old argument is resorted to to induce fnnffTPss to Durchase Grant an ad . ( ditional number of presents in the way : of town lots, to be given him if th San I Domingo matter is a success. In speak ing of the Alabama question he regrets that no conclusion hss been reached for . tue adjustment of the claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted V that Government during tb reUUion. The Cabinet at London, ao (ar ai its views have been expressed, does not appear to be willing to concede that her Majesty's Government was guil ty of negligence, nor did or permitted any act duriLg the war by which the United States has just caose of com plaint. Our firm and unalterable con victions are directly the reverse, and therefore recommends to Congress to ao tiiorije the appointment of a com mis rDer to take proof' be amouau and tbe ownership of the claims or give notice to tie rprrei.saiive of H.-r Mjety at VTakiiigton. aa that authority be given fut ti x,imBaiat U th- claims I f tit Tailed States. . that the Gov-ernny-at etkll hate the owaenhip of tbe V.ru i'.Btoi, well at the repoiuuU - ... of tU ciaif ac:nt GrtX Brit- sua. it t&( Eeary ta ad.. ayi 1 -a-. wi-s,erer ijer Kaj-fty G jtera - baw.mT. eAert:saerf-jrafii"a4 .v--.,aa wax i taxuext & r'.r tur a -oi.'jiu,t.i (uirm w :h tl tut i r,- .X Lath uvai iLuud ir i. tu revevsrf f-fjra.-. ti Prv.unA tw o-t uet hit f. ijry. vui M l-' m rfext&l a Lad W- ed to ft(i it w--ai i Tbe rT-ifa. t-j k-'-.-e A 1 m b- re i.'-d btr. lttl ''.

' if It weans this, has my hearty support; it it meaus a collection of all the revenues for the support of the government, for the payment of the principal and interest of the public debt, pensions," et., bydi- rectly taxing the people, then 1 am against such revenue reform, and confi dently believe that the people are wim me. If it means a failure to provide the necessary means to defray all ex penses of the government, and thereby repudiation of the public debt and pen sions, then I am still more opposed to it. Such kind of revenue reform has not been defended by its advocates to my kuowledge, and seems to be accepted as something which is to supply; every man's wants, without any cost or effort oo his part. A true revenue reform can not be made in a day, but must be the work of national legislation and time.

Of property "in custodia ltgis, the law gives the possession to the-olhecr en titled to receive it, and who is bonded tor that purpose. A general agent always yields to the authority of a special aud particular agent. . A policeman is a general agent. A coroner is a particular judicial officer or agent, appointed for this especial pur pose. Hut even without this, the policy of the law and tbe intent of the statute would govern in establishing a precedeut of such importance. i' 

OPINIO. j: ; J. O. MuffaU vs. Thomas O'tlonnell. This is an alternative writ of manda mus issued at the instance of the relator against the respondent; and tbe question now is.whether upon the facts of the case a peremptory writ Khali issue, command-1 ing respondent to deliver to relator .ir tain property found upon one Frost, who was killed by accident. The facts necessary to be noticed are, that Frost, being taken up trom the street in an insensible condition, was taken by a polireainn to tbe Adams street station-noune; while in this condi tion all of his valuables were taken ou of his person by the subordinate of respond ent, that when Frost awoke from his state of coma, respondent told him that his valuables had been taken from him, and as Frost was about to leave the sta-tioa-house to go to his friends, he was asked by refpondeut if he wbthed to have the eli'pf ta returned to him, when he re plied: "No, keep them for me until I get well." In less than twelve hours afur this Frost was dead. Vnqnestionablr upon tbe facts, the effects taken by re spondent from Frost were taken from him before his death. , , . . Clearly, then, the rase does not fall Wilkin the vurdiui tbe statute requiring tbe Coroner to take possession of the effects found ''on" (ir "with'1 tbe body of the dead. ...... It is insisted that it is clearly within the spirit of the statute, aSsJ that the r.gbt construction ofthe statute would give him the property. It is fs-4 respondent had V right as Chief of F.Uc to take front Frost the. effects. While the court cannot agree with counsel ia this, vet, for this argu ment, grant that be haJ not. If he was a wrong-dj-r, does the law devolve upon the coroner the redress of the wrong?

If what he had sloiie as Chiof.of Police, was tinaiithorued and wrouf? and 1 do not think it u,,dBr the circumstances certainly the trust reposed in him as a man should not be interfered with by any one except 1' rost. or those who legally represent him; and this the Coroner does not do. Indeed, the property should all be returned to his custody. Let the petition dor Man damus le dismissed, with costs.' While the Court M constrained to order this, it is with commendation of the actum ot both officers in tho premises: and the Court hopes that if any harsh feelings have been engendered Jiy llua proceed ing It will ceuse'withit termination. For nothing so clogs the wheels of good government, and is so inimical to good orderwhich it is the duty ot us all to conserve as disagreement and cross purposes between officers of the law. h " i C.

The six judges were all in attendance. The Qhief Justice announced that upon an examination of the docket he found 1247 civil causes uow for trial,- exclusive of State causes 206 were filed in 18ti7. TheCourt proposes to ' devote three months' labor to the docket.and if it is not lcoken up by quo varrautq proceedings ia the IVited States Court at Knoxville, t which three of them were required to answer oa the second Monday in Janu ary, the Court will be enabled to give three full months to the work. The Chief Justice said the Court had con salted in full as to whether the dispatch of bturitiess would be promoted by sitting ia two sections, as authorized by the Con-. ventioa. lie said whilst they Had grave doubts whither any more could he ac complished by sitting in two sections, they had determined to make an experi ment for one week. Next week Nichol son. ueaaortcs ana aueea win an i caart in the Supreme Courtroom, trying the business of the 7th Circuit for 18C7 aad and XeUon, Turner and Free man will . sil in the' ' Federal Court room, trying the business of the tth Circuit for 1x67 and le'68. The coatt will aefln fall bench during the present week, and will take up the svepth circuit and hear causes filed in li7 and IS6K, commencing with the law docket, then the equity docket, and then the State docket of each county. The Comptroller's report is ready for presentation to the Legislature. It says the amount of currency to be received nuder the tax law for 170 will fall short of defraying the current expenses of the State, while the increas-id tax levied for 1W1 will also fall short. The Comp troller contines: When a Slate that owes a : bonded deU of $3,539,02, has a revenue law insufficient to meet her current expenses, to say nothing of pro viding a sum to pay tbe semi-annual in terest, or providing a sinking fund, it may be taken as pretty conclusive evi dence that our revenue law need modify ing. Every dollar received for taxes in lhTO will be needed to defray expenses of your honorable body or salaries of your judges, would exhaust it, while the Pub lic Printer will require oae-third of it. There are reasons for it, and cull lor very prompt measures. We cannot always borrow; in faet, it is now impossible to borrow at all upon our revenue law as ' a basis; this has been tried. Mem do not lend unless the hoipwer gives a reasonable an-nrnnc-e of his abil ity to pay quite parly. After the ad journment of your honorable body last July, a loan ly my predecessor in office ia New York to pay Ward 4 Uriggs be came due, and having no money, and having been refuse the authority to! borrow of lbs Stuto, I came neur having her bonds hypothecated, at forty cents on the dollar.

This latter line has recently been surveyed by Mr. Win S. Moon, of this city. The distunce from Okolona to the Tennessee river, at or near ' EutporL is iabout nixfy-five miles. The survey extends through Ful ton',' the county-seat ofltuwiiihbacftnuty, up to the valley- of the lombigbee thence tip Macky's creek, which has the finest water power in the South, crossing the dividing ratige of the Tennessee and Alabama waters six miles south of Iuka, through which town it passes to the Ton ncssee. river. The profile of the route. prepared by 'Mr. Moon,' exhibits a fuir average grade along the entire line, ul though it runs through high hills and lo valleys. Tbe finest specimens of silica, which is extensively used in the tnantia facture of glass, nnd pure kaolin, were found by the engineer iu ' large Lquattlities along . the line ot tne F . n, l 1 . 8. urnnosed route. . ine - Kaonn is used in tbe manufacture of porcelain and these specimens of . silica and kaolin, which can be seen in the en gineer's office, are perfectly pure.VThe line frotti Nashville to the Tennessee river, , 'along the old Wayuesborough route, was .graded before the war, but during the war the iron was taken up and placed on other lines, .The road as consolidated and proposed, runs from. Yicksburg up the Yazoo Valley toYaioo Citv and on to Grenada. General Tucker's road then carries the line from Grenada, via Houston, to Okolona, aud this new liue from Okolona to the Ten- nesse river will connect it with the Nash ville and Eastport link, thereby forming almost -an air-lie from Nashville to Yicksburg. Geueral Tucker's charter covers the whole line from Vichsburg to the Tennessee river, and under this char ter this consolidation and extension will go into Operation. It is understood that work will be. commenced on these re spective lines at an early day, and that the company , is backed with sufficient funds to carry on the enterprise to com pletion. '.
