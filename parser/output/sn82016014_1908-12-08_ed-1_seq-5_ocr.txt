Taft is editor and proprietor, today pub' lished the following reply to the article on the Panama canal which appeared in the Indianapolis News and New York World: "The New York World, the paper which was responsible for most of the talk about the 'Panama canal scandal during the recent campaign says this morning: " "Whether Douglas Robinson, who is Mr. Roosevelt's brothei-in-la w, or any of Mr. Taft's brothers associated himself with Mr. Cromwell in Panama exploitation or shared in these profits is merely, incidental to the main issue of letting in the light.' "This statement is intentionally mis leading. The Panama story was used in the. campaign for political reasons solely. The one thing that gave it political value in the eyes of those who used it was "the fact that the story as printed carried the names of a brother of the Republican candidate for the presidency and of a brother-in-law of the president. The inference was plain enough. It was that Theo dore Roosevelt and William H. Taft had used their influence as hign offi cials of the United States government to help near relatives in looting the treasury at Washington. That was the meat of the story. If the names of Douglas Robinson and Charles P. Taft had not been included in it. flimsy and absurd as it was. the lying yarn would never have been used by the World. But the World, the Indian apolis News and other papers for one reason or another wanted to defeat Mr. Taft and discredit Mr. Roosevelt. "The World is trying to dodge the issue It wants to be relieved of the responsi bility of trying to drag the names of Mr. Robinson and Mr. Taft into its made-to-order mess of scandal and slime. "Both the World and the Indianapolis News are crying 'let in the light." We thoroughly agree with Them. But after a little time has passed, after the most des perate efforts of the World and News have produced all the. evidence they can, an apology will be in order from those newspapers. "In the meantime Mr. Taft reserves the right to take legal steps, which possibly have been made more desirable by the events and insinuations of the past hours." 

SOMETHING NEW. President Sends an Illustrated Mrs ape to Congrtss. Document Was Read in Both Houses at Neon. v DYINCON BED. Mrs. A. C. Farrar Believed to Have Been Murdered. ALL IN THEIR SEATS.

Washington, Dec. 8. Interest in both houses of congress centered today in the president's message. Senator Aid rich, on behalf of the senate commit tee and Representative Payne for the house committee, appointed to notify the president that the two bodies were in session informed their respective houses that they had performed their duty and each reported that the presi dent had responded with a statement that he would immediately submit a message in writing. Secretary Latta followed close upon the heels of the two committees, appearing first in the sen ate and then in the house. The read ing of the message began in the sen ate at 12:15, a quarter of an hour after that body had convened and in the house a few minutes later. The galleries of both houses were well filled and almost all the seats of sena tors and members were occupied. ' All of them were supplied with printed cop ies of the message which contained an elaborate appendix accompanied by numerous illustrations showing the re sults of the work of the forestry bureau. Senators and members gave compara tively little attention to the reading of the message, but most of them immedi ately busied themselves with the print ed copies before them. Cummins Sworn In. Washington, Dec. 8. The senate met promptly at noon today and after read ing the journal Senator Doiliver pre sented the credentials of Senator-elect Albert B. Cummins of Iowa, and the oath of office was administered.
