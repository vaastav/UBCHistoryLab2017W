A special despatch to the Baltimore Sim says: The "Southern Loyalists" met last evening, and had in consultation with them Messrs. Stevens, Sumner, et al. of that ilk. Thc latter advised thc "Loyalists" to get up a petition of Southern loyalists to Congress, ask? ing that the Southern States be treat? ed as territories, provisional govern? ors appointed, etc. Hon. Hamilton Ward, of New York, will introduce a bill in thc House to-morrow providing for set? ting aside tho present State Govern? ments of the Southern States, thc appointment of provisional govern? ors by the chief justice, formation of State constitutions aud governments by conventions of delegates elected by the people who are citizens of the United States, except certain classes who are designated as perjurers, gue? rillas, murderers and editors of rebel newspapers, who shall bc forever dis? franchised. The New York Tribune's corres? pondent gives the following account of their condition and proceedings: The Southern Republican Associa? tion met this evening, at their rooms on F street, the Hon. Thomas J. Du? rant, President, in I'JC chair. Sixty members were present, each Stato being fully represented, except North Carolina and Arkansas, though twen? ty-five citizens of thc former State are'now on their way to Washington, to participate in the deliberations of the society and to care for the inte? rests of the State during the session of Congress. The association having been counseled by leading members of Congress, at a previous meeting, as to the most expeditious method of dealing with thc unreconstructed States, the meeting of to-night was given wholly to the discussion of this question. Tho association declared unanimously in favor of universal suffrage; that the present State go? vernments ought by Congress be de? clared nullities, and that Congress should devise some means of govern? ing these districts or ?tetritories through a loyal element. It is safe to say the general sense of the mem? bers present favored territorial go? vernments for those districts South; though some advocated that Con? gress pass enabling acts and authorize and protect the loyal people, irre? spective of color, in these districts, in forming new governments; others contendiug that Congress had the power to form thc governments. Two propositions.were presented a:> plans for re-organization and referred to tho Committee of Twelve, who have the preparation of suggestions for Congress under consideration. The first of these, by Judge Saffold, of Alabama, was to authorize the ap? pointment of two commissioners by the United States District Judges in each State, to constitute an advisory board with said judge, to be a part of the court or board which would carry into effect an enabling act. Thc second proposition was by Judge Sherwood, of Texas, for Congress to appoint commissioners for each State to prepare a State Constitution, to be approved by Congress, and submit it to tho people for ratification. Dr. Sidney, Corresponding Secretary, in? troduced a delegation of colored men from each of the several organiza? tions in this city, who desired thc co-operation of thc association in a demonstration to be made next Thursday in this city in favor ol' colored suffrage. It was, on motion, voted to join in the proceedings of that day. The meeting adjourned at a late hour to meet to-morrow night. -<-??.?-?-, 

CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. - The New York Express says: We aro likely to have about as many Constitutions in these United States ns the French Directory made for Franco, in their short-lived reign. The world turns up but little new. The radicals of this day are tho very same as thc Jacobins of France and the Greek and Roman radicals, that, in the end, destroyed their republics, and subjected them all to despotism. There is nothing new in politics. Every item of political new3 printed daily is as old as 500 B. C. Tile Intention. Some few weeks ago a gentleman from Jefferson County, Mississippi, addressed a letter to Horace Greeley, asking him, as one of thc leaders of thc Republican party, what tito in? tentions of the party wore with re? ference to tl e South. Mr. Greeley very courteously and promptly re? plied in the following lotter: ROCHESTER, New York, October 27, 1866.-DEAS Sm: Your letter iiuds mc away from home, engaged in our political canvass. Leaving, with many others, I must answer hur? riedly. 1. I know of uo considerable influ? ential . ulioii of tho people, North or West, who expect or desire any gen? eral (or other) confiscation of South em property. I am personally ac? quainted with most abolitionists of note-Gerrit Smith, Charles Sumner, Governor Chase, etc., and not one of them favors a policy of confiscation. Thad. Stevens and Gen. Butler may be exceptions, General Butler being a nev/ convert from thc Democracy. 2. Even the tax on cotton-though I thiuk it falls (especially) mainly on the consumer, not the producer-is certain to bc taken off very soon. It is sustained only because ol' the need of a local revenue. 3. I am very sure that no Southern man who remains quietly at home and attends to his business will ever be troubled because of bis part in the late rebellion. Assassins and house burners may, sometimes, be prosecu? ted; but oftener those who professed to be unionists than those who were rebels. 4. I think the general prevalent sentiment of thc North was adverse to any exaction of the South, with regard to political rights for tho blacks, till after the New Orleans riots effected a decided change, and, I think, it is uow the moro prevalent opinion here that the better portion of the Southern whites will never pro? tect the blacks from outrage and mur? der at the hanels of the low caste whites, and that the right of suffrage for the blacks, is indispensable to their safety. 5. I think you mislead yourself by a misuse of terms, when you talk of the "equality of the whites and blacks." In five New England States their Constitution and laws make no difference, and know none, between whites and blacks; and yet, I think, there is far less intercourse between the whites and blacks in Boston (for instance) than in New Orleans. You do not ask me for advice out? side your question, yet I venture to proffer this counsel : Let the South? ern States resolve to establish and maintain, henceforth, a thoroughly good understanding with tho South? ern blacks. Encourage the latter to hold conventions and select their best men to confer with your best men, resolved that a perfect, good under? standing between the two races shall be had. I trust there is no more trouble ahead; but in any case, such an un derstandiug is of the gravest impor? tance to all. Yours truly, HORACE GREELEY. IMPORTANT DECISION.-lu the Cir? cuit Court of this County, yesterday, in the case of Hooe r.s\ Tilston, in which the plaintiff sued for the reco? very of city property sold during the war under a decree of Judge Under? wood, Judge Thomas decided that, by the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, Congress could not forfeit more than the life estate of the party charged with the offences stated in the Act of Congress provid? ing for the confiscation of tho pro? perty of persons engaged in the re? bellion, and that as Daniel F. Hooe, against whose property the proceed? ings were instituted, had departed this life, the plaintiff, his devisee, was entitled to tho recovery of the property. An appeal from this deci? sion was taken, and the case will be decided by the Supremo Court of tho United States. \Alexandria (huelle, S/h. FAXLURE OF THE COTTON CROPS IN NORTHERN GEORGIA.-A correspond? ent of the Nashville Banner, writing from Milledgeville, Ga., on the 5th instant, says: "We have finished picking cotton. Never has such an event occurred before, at thi.<-*ime of tho year, in tho history cf lie country. The drought and rust, and an early frost, ruined our prospects for an average crop of the snowy staple. We will make a third of a crop-no more. Below us, in some parts of Miller and Decatur Counties, the worm finished what thc rust and drought spared. Owing to the shortness of the crop of cotton, many of our farmers have become discouraged, and sold out, to try other pursuits." ? <. -?-? The Tennessee Legislature has passed a resolution to adjourn on thc 17th instant, and xueef siguin on the . 1st of January. Test Oaths. Thc Nashville Union and Dispah lt, j speaking of the decision of the Su j promo Court on thc test oath., has thc following excellent remarks: Test oaths are choice engines of ty? ranny. Under their cover, it is possi? ble for thc party holding power to commit any enormity. Thc principle admitted, it can be made universally ?applicable. If, in forming our free Government, tho fathers meant any j one thing moro than another in the list of inestimable franchises which make up civil liberty, it was security from proscription for opinion's sake. They revolted from a Government where the people had suffered umlei? test oaths. They had no thought that tho scheme of Government which their toil and sacrifices had won should contain a vestige of the odious principle which sanction .J them. They were careful to exclude it from the Constitution, and never intended that fair interpretation should find it there. Not until within the last five years in this country did any man pretending to statesmanship think to seek for it, and no man who had even dared to speak '.vas thought to w ish to use it. Tho frightful thing that has been throttled by the ?Supremo Court was an outgrowth of the civil war-an appliance of tho mad ambi? tion which provoked the contest, prolonged the struggle, and now x>re vents the return of pence. It is an? tagonistic to free institutions. If it prevails, they cannot stand. If wc are to have liberty, it must be ex? punged from the statute book. If it is not, this once admirable Govern? ment is to bc ruled in future, by a succession of factions, each one in turn increasing thc sweep and the force of the oaths of exclusion it will propound, until freedom is destroyed. During hostilities, there was some pretext for an oath of allegiance as a measure of military precaution, but it became a broad farce, useless for any good purpose, and demoralizing in its tendency. Buta political test oath, such as that which now debars a large mass of the people of this country from civil affairs, is a monster that caji never be tolerated by a free people. What action Congress and other legislative bodies will take under this decision remains to bo seen. It has been charged that thc President, in his message, advocated the applica? tion of tho test oath to members of Congress, but we do not perceive that a fair reading authorizes such a construction. We are certain that he did not mean it in the sense that the radicals in that body do. It is now, perhaps, his duty to officially inform Congress of the ruling of the Supreme Courtjon this grave and vital ques? tion, and recommend its appeal. At any rate, it is tho duty of the con? servative men in Congress and every? where in the nation, through every avenue of public opinion, to demand that tho verdict of thc court of last resort shall be respected.

LOUISIANA.-A special de? spatch to thc New York World, ?f Monday, says: Hereafter the classification of cot? ton in New Orleans will be in confor? mity to the Liverpool classification, and quotations will be made and published in accordance therewith. It has been reported in Northern papers that tho agent of the Freed? men's Bureau at Bayou Sara was murdered by rebels. Inquiry has developed the fact that the deed was actually committed by a Union man. Deceased was highly esteemed by people generally. -? ? - In the United States House of Representatives, on tho5th inst., Mr. Lawrence, from Ohio, from the Com? mittee on the Judiciary, reported a bill relating to the qualification of jurors in United States Courts. This measure relates to thejj selection of juries in the prospective triaLs for treason, and provides that a man shall not be disqualified from being a juror on account ci having formed opinions from newspaper reports or rumors, provided that the Court is satisfied that he will render a verdict I according to law and evidence. THE RELIEF QUESTION IN GEORGIA. It was no doubt a great relief to the House of Representatives to get rid of the relief question. The bill, as it passed, may bo summed up in a very few words; it repeals the stay law so far as it authorizes the creditor to collect one-fourth next January, and postpones the time to January 1st, 1868,"when one-third may be collect? ed, and one-third on tho first of January, ltJGD and 1870. This, we believe, is tho material feature of the bill.-Milledgeville Union. -. .> Thirty persons, charged with coun? terfeiting, were arraigned before the United States Court, in New York, on Monday. WHITE LABOE.-Thc Memphis Ap? peal says the. system of white labor which has been inaugurated by seve? ral Southern communities, will surely tend to develop the greatness of the South, and if adopted by all the States, will eventually populate this j section with thc same proportion of j the North. It will remove thc in? dolent black Lem our midst, and give us an energetic people who will, in the course of time, put vigor and life where the present freedman is but an incubus. It will make main radical changes, to be sure, but the children of these white European laborers will be educated by our peo? ple, and their opinions willboformed by thc teachhigs that surround them. This, then, will bo an element not only of vigor, but of strength to tho South, and if carried out properly is tho only method by which wc can eventually out-vote thc North.. We have tho territory, and only lack the population to do it. - Thc Tribune has this Washington despatch : "It is stated here that last evening Secretary Seward called on Mr. Thad? deus Stevens at his rooms, and had a long private interview with him. The statement causes a great deal of comment here, and much speculation is rife to know what it all meant. The above gentlemen have not been on friendly relations with each othor for several 3-ears. It is rumored that Seward is repentant, like Raymond, and wants to come back into the bosom of the radical party. Others think that Seward was sent by Presi? dent Johnson to make overtures of compromise."
