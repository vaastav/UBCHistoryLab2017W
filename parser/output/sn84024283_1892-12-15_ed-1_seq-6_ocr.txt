REPORTS. Ths reports of the beads of ths several executive departments, which ara-herewith sub mitted, have very naturally included a resume of tbe whole work of tbe administration with the transaction of tbe last flcal year. The at tention not only of congrass. but of ths conn try, is again invited to the methods of adminis tration wbich bave bean pursued, and to the results wbich bave b?en attained. Pnblic revennes amounting to $1,414,079,232.23 bave been collected and disbursed without loss from misappropriation, without a single defalcation of such importance as to attract tbe pnblic attention, aad at a diminish ed per cent, of cost for collection. The public business has been transacted not only with fidelity, but progressively, and with a view to giving to tbe people ii tbe fullest pos sible degree tbe benefits of a service estab lished aud maintained for their protection and comfott. PORZIOn RELATIONS. Our relations with othsr nations are now un disturbed by any serious controversy. The complicated and threatening differences with Germany and England relating to Hamoan affair, with England in relation to the seal fisheries in the Barring sea, and with Cbili growing out of tha Baltimore affair, ha e bean adjusted. RstiFROcrry agreements. There bave been negotiated and concluded, nnder section 3 of tbe tariff hi, commercial agreements relating to reciprocal trade with the following countries: Brazil, Dominican. Republic. Spain for Cnbs and Porto Rico. Gua temala, Salvador, the O-rmin empire. Great Britain for certain West Indis colonies and British Guiana, Nicaragua, Honduras and Austria-Hungary. Of these, these with Gua temala. Salvador, tba German empire. Great Britain. Nicaragua. Hondura and Austria Hungary bave been concluded sine 9 my last an nual message. Under these trade arrangements, a fia favored admission has been secured in every case for an important lift of American products. Especial care has been taken to se cure markets for farm products in order to re lieve that great underlying industry of ths de pression which the lack of an adequate foreign markat for our surplus often brings. An open ing has also leen made for manufactured prod ucts that will undoubtedly, if this policy is maintained, greatly augment our export trade. Tbe full benefits of thee arrangements can not be realized instantly. New lines of trade are to be opened. Tbe commercial traveler must survey the field. Tbe uiviufacturer must adapt hi goods to the new market and facili ties for exchange must be established. This work has been well begun; our mercha-its and manufacturers bave entered tbenaw flel Iswith courage and enterprise. In tba case of food products and special lines of trade with Cuba, the trade did not n-od to wait and the imme diate results bave been most gratifying. If tbis polic7 and tbe trad arrangements can be continued in force and aided by the establishment of American steamship lin?s, I do not doubt that wa shall w.thin a short period, secure fully one-third of tbe total trade of the countries of Central and South America, which now amounts to about $600,000,000 annnsliy. Ia 18:5 wa ha 1 only 8 per cent, of this trade. SHE BEHRISO SEA QUESTION. A treaty providing for the arbitration of the disputa between Great Britain and tbe United States as to tbe killing of seals in tbe Bearing sea was conclnded oa tho 2'Jth of February last. This treaty was accompanied by an agreement prohibiting pelagic sealing ponding the arbitration, and a vigorous effort was made during tbii season to drive out all poaching steamers from tbe Bearing sea. Six naval ves sels, three revenue cutters, an 1 one vessel from the fish commission, all nnder tbe "CT'"3 of Ccmrcaudor Evans, of tii3 ftavy, wsra seat into tha s?a, whfoh : sr;r.ic'lv patroled.

Tbe case of the United States for tbe tribunal of arbi tration has b'en prepared with great care and industry by Hon. John W. Foster, and tbe connsel who represent this government express conndence that a resultsunstantlally establish ing our claims and preserving this great indus try to tbe benefit of all nations will be at tained. 

RECIPROCITY WITH CANADA, During tbe past year a suggestion was re ceived tnronga the British Minister tbat the Canadian government would like to confer as to the possibility of enlarging, upon terms of mutual advantage, tbe commercial exchanges of Canada and or the United rotates, and a con ference was beld at Washington, with Mr. Biaine acting for this government, and the British minister at this capital and tbrse mem bers of the Dominion cabinet acting as cmn- nissioners on tin part of Great Britain. Tbe conference developed tbe fact that the Canadian government was eoly prepared to oner to to United States in exctiange lor the-concession asked the admission of natural products. The statement was frankly made that favored rates could not be given to the United States as against the mother eonntrr. This admission. wbicn was foreseen, necessarily terminated tbe conference npon this qn est ion. The benefits of an exeuange oi tne- natural products wonld be almost wholly with! the peo ple of Cansda. Other tepics of interest were considered in tbe conference and have resulted in tbe making of a convention for exxaniniag the Alaskan bonndary, tbe waters of Paseama onoddv bay ad jacent to East port. Me., and on tbe initiation of an arrangement for tbt pro tection of fish -life in tbe- coterminous and naighboring waters of our north boundary. THE CAXAL TOLLS CO STROVE EST.

SOUTH AMERICAN BKTTBLIC. I have endeavored in everyway to assure onr sister republics of Central and South America tbat tbe United States government and its peo ple bave only the most friendly disposition to ward them all. We do not covet their terri tory. We bavo no disposition to bs oppressive or exacting in onr dealings with any of them, even th weakest. Our interests and our hopes for them all lie in tbe direction of stable governments by their people and of the largest development of tbeir great com mercial resources. The mutual benefits of enlarged commercial exchanges and of a more familiar and friendly intercourse between onr people we do desire, and in this havs sought their friendly co-operation. I have believed, however, while holding these sentiments in the greatest sincerity, that we must insist npon a just responsibility for any Injuries inflicted npon our official representa tives or upon our citizens. This insistance, kindly aud justly, bat firmly male, will, I be lieve, promote peace and mutual respect. OUR RELATIONS WITH HAWAII. Our relations with Hawaii bavo been such as to attract an increased interest and must con tinue to do so. I deem it of great importance that tbe projected submarine cable, a survey for which has been made, should be promoted. Both for naval and commercial uses, we should bave qnick communication with Honolulu. We should before this have availed ourselves of the concession mads many years ago to this government for a harbor and naval station at Pearl river. Many evi dences of tbe friendliness of , tbe Ha waiian government have been given in the past, and it is gratifying to believe that the advantage and necessity of a continuance of very closa relation i is appreciated. THE NEW ORLEANS LYNCH I NO. Tbe friendly act of this government in ex pressing to tbe government of Italy its reoro bation and abhorrence of tbe lynching ot Ital ian subjects in New Orleans by tbe payment of 125,000 trapes, or $24,330.90, was accepted by the king of ltalv with every manifestation of gra cious appreciation, and tbe incident has been highly promotive of mutual raspect and good wi;l A PROTEST TO PRAIf C. In consequence of the action of ths French government in proclaiming a protectorate over certain tribal districts ot tbe west coast of Africa, eastward of tbe San Pedro river, I have felt constrained to maks protest against this encroachment npon tbe territory of a renublic wb'ch was founded by dtizans of tbe United States, and towards which this country has for many years held the intimate relation of a friendly counselsr. GOOD WILL TO MEXICO. The recent disturbances ot the pub lic peace by lawless foreign marauders on the Mexican frontier have afforded the government an opportunity to testify its good will for Mexico and its earnest purpose to ful fill tbe obligations of international friendship by pursuing and dispersing the evil doers. The work of re-locating tbe boundary ot the treaty of Gaudaloupe Hidalgo westward from El Paso is progressing favorably. FRIENDLY WITH SPAIN. Our intercourse with Spain continues on a friendly footing. I regret however, not to be able te report as yet the adjustment of the claims of tbe American missionaries arising from tbe disorders at Ponape in the Caroline islands, but I anticipate a satisfactory adjust ment in view of renewed and urgent represen tatives to the government at Madrid. CONTROVERSY WITH TURKEY. The treatment of tbe religious and educa tional etabliuments of American citizens in Turkey has of lata called for more vban tba nsual share of attention. A tendency to curtail the toleration wbich has so beneficially prevailed is discernible, and has called forth tba earnest remonstrances of this government. Harrassing regulations in regard to schools end chnrcbes have been attempted in certain localises, but not with out due protest and the assertion of the in herent and conventional rights of our country men. Violations ot domicla and search of the persons and effects of citizens ot tbe United States by apparently irresponsible offlcia's ia tbe AslaUc v'lnyts have fro'n V.T.i to ime been rvorted. An aggravated instance of injury to tha property of an American missionary at Bourdenr. in the province of Konia, called forth an urgent c'alm for repa ration, wbich I am pleased to say wa prompt ly heeded by the government of tbe Porte. In terference with the trading ventures of our citi zens in Asia Minor is also reported, and tbe lac!t of consular representation in that region is a serious drawback to instant and effective protection. I can not believe that these inci dent represent a settled policy and shall not cease to urge tha adoptiaa of pronsr remedies. INTE1NATIONAL CQPmZilT. International copyright has been extended to iiaiy ny proclamation in coniermity witn the set of March 3. 1891. nnon assurance heinor gTfH tbnt Italian law permits to citizens of tne united mate tno benefit oi convrigiiton substantially tba same basis as ths subjects of Italy. Bv a sn-eial convention, proclamation Jan nary 15, 1892, r.-ciprocal provisions of copyright bave been applied between the United States and Germany. Negotiations are in progress wita otner countries to tba same end. THE NICARAGUA CANAL. I repeat with great earnestness tho recom mendation which I bava made mention of m a urevious messiges to tba insdeauate snnnort given tbe American company engaged in tbe construction of th Nicaragua ship canal. It is impossible to overstate tbe valus from every standpoint of this great enterprise, and I hope that tbera may b-e time given in this congress to give to it an mioetus tbat will inur tba enrly completion of tba canal and secure to tbe United States its proper relations to it whan completed. THE MONETARY CONFERENCE. The eongress has been already advised tbat the invitations of this government for the as sembling of an international monetary confer ence to consider tha question of an enlarged issus of silver accepted ley the nations to which tbev were issned- Ths con'eranc assembled at Brussels on tha 22d of November, and has entered upon tbe consideration of this great question. I have not doobted. and have taken occasion to express that belief, as well in the invitations issued for this conference as in my public messages, that the free coinage of silver upon an agreed international ratio would greatly promote tbe interests of our people and equally tbosa of other nations. It is too early to predict what results may be accomplished by the conference. If any temporary check or delay intervenes, I believe that very soon commercial conditions will compel tbe now reluctant governments ts nnlte with nsin this movement to secure the enlargement of the volume of money needed for the transaction cc the Dnstoass ot tn world.

The organi zation and enlargement of the bureau of mditary information which the secretary has effected is a work the usefulness of which will become every year more apparent. The work of building heavy guns and the construction of coast defenses has been well begun and should be carried on wituout eneck. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The report of the at torn ay-genera I is by law submitted directly to congress, but I cannot refrain from saying that ha has conducted tbe increasing work of the department of justice with great professional skill. Ha has in eeverai directions secured from ths courts decisions giving increased protection to the officers of the United States and bringing some classes of crime tbat escaped local cognizance and punishment into tbe tribunals nf the United States, where they could be tried with impartiality. I have heretofore expressed my concurrence in tbe recommendation of tba attorney general that degrees of murder should ba recognized in the federal statutes as they are, I believe, in all tbe states. These (grades are founded on cor rect distinctions in crime. Tha recognition of them wonld enable ths courts to exercise some discretion in apportioning punishment and would greatly relieve the executive of what is coming to be a very heavy burden tbe exam ination of these cases on application for com mutation THH POST OFFICB DEPARTMENT. The report of the postmaster -general shows a most gratifying increase and a most efficient and progressive management of tha great busi ness of tnat department. The remarkable in crease in revenues.in tbe number of post-offices and in the miles of mail interchange furnishai further evidences of the high state of pros perity which our people are enjoying. New offices mean new hamlets snd towns; new routes mean the extension of our border set tlements snd increased revenues mean active commerce. The postmaster-general reviews the whole period ot bis administration of the office and brings some of bis statistics dawn to tha month of Novem ber last. The postal revenues hare increased during tbe last year nearly S5.000.OJ0. Tbe deficit for tbe year ending June 30, 1892, is $848,341 less than that deficiency of the preced ing year. Ths deficiency of tbe present fiscal year, it is estimated, wilt be reduced ito $1,552. 483. wbtcb will not only ba extinguished during the next fiscal year, but a sarplus ot nearly $1,000,000 sliould then be shown. In tbe calculations tbe payments to be made nnder tbe contracts for ocean mail service have not been included. There bave been added 1,080 new mail routes during ths year with a mileage of 8,863 miles, and the total number of new miles of mail trips added during tba year is nearly 17.000,000. The number of miles of mail journevs added during the last four years is about 7S.0O).00O. this addition being 21,000,000 of milas more tbaa were in operation in tbe whole country in 1861. The number of post offices has been in craasad by 2,790 during the year, and during the past four years, np to October 23 last, tha total increase in tbe number of ofEcas has been nearly 9.000. The number of frea-delivery offices has been nearly doubled in the past four years, and the number of money-order offices more than dbubled within that time. For three years ending June "0. 1892, the postals revenue amounted to $187,741,352, whi h was an increase ot $52,243,150 over tha revenue for the three years ended June 30. 1888, the increase dnring tbe last three years being more than three and a half times as great as ths increase during tho thrae years ending Juna 30, 188 i. No sncb increase as tbat shown for these three years has ever previously appeared in tbe revenues of the de partment. Tbe postmaster-general has ex tended to the post offices in tha larger cities the metit system of promotion, introduced by my direction into the departments Here, and it has resulted tbsre. as in tne departments, in a large volume of work and tbat better done. THE 

DECLINE OF OUB MERCHANT MARINE. Ever since onr merchant marina was driven from tbe sea by the rebel cruisers daring the war of tha rebellion, tbe United States bas bean paring an enormous annual tribute to foreign countries in tha srpo o! frejrht sad passage moneys. Our gra'd and meiTj have been taken at onr own docks and our larje im ports there laid down by foreign ship masters. An iucreasinr to?nt of American travel to Europe has coatriddle J a vaSt sttra annually to the dividends ot foreiga ship owners. Tbe bal ance of trade shovrn by tna books of our cus tom houses fcij been largely reduced and in many years auogsther extinguished by Jijs constant strain. Ii tba yjar I5T2 July 12.3 par cent, of onr imports w3TS tn-p-jgit in American vessel. Tho foreign steamialps ma ntaino i by our traffic are, many of them, under contract with their respective govern ments by which in time of war they will be coma a part ot tbeir armed naval establish ment. A NEW DEPARTttaH. Profiting by pur commerce in paaco tta.ejr will become tbe mo?t formidable destroyers of our commerce ia time of war. I felt and bave before expressed tha feeling that this condition of things wis both intolerable and disgraceful. A whole some change of policy, and having in it much promite. as it seams to ma. was bezun by tha law of March 3. 1691. Under this law contracts hava been made by the po3tmaster-gnarat for eleven mail routes. Tba expenditure involved by these contracts for tha next fiscal year ap proximated S95i,123.3X As ons of the good re sults re-icbed, sixteen American ships, of an aggregate tonnage of 57,400 tons, costing 57.40), 000, bave been built or contracted to bs built in American ship-yards. No subject, I think, more nearly touches tho pride, ths power and the prosperity of our country than this of tha development of our merchant man no upon tae sea. If wa -rould enter into conference with other competitors, and all would agree to withhold government aid, we conld, perhaps, take our chances with the r-st, but onr gr-at competitors bava estab lished aud maintained tbeir linos by govern ment subsidies until aov tbey have practically excluded ns from participation. In my opinion, no choice is left to u but t pursue, moderate ly at least, tha sams lin :s- THE NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report ot the secretary of the navy .- bisits great progress in tbe construction of our new nsvy. When tbe present secretary entered upon bis duties only three steel ves sels) were in commission. Tbe vessels sinee- pntin commission and to be pat into commis sion during tbe winter will xaske a total of nineteen daring bis administration of tbe de partment. Daring tbe current year ten war veseis ana tnree navy tugs nave men launcuea- and daring- tbe four years twenty-fire vessels will nave seen launcnea. lira otner large ships and . a torpedo beat ars nnder eontraet and tbe work upon tbem well advanced,-and the four monitors ara awaiting only the arrival of their armor, which has been unexpectedly delayed, or they would have bean before this in commission.

NATAL MILITIA. The dsvelopment of a naval milHIa w'll-h has been organised in e-'ght states and brought inta cordial and esvoperative relations with tho navy, is another important achsjvmnt. There are now enliited in these organ izations nrenv and tbey ara likaly to be greatly extended.. I recommend such legisla tion and appropriations as will encourage and develop Mils' movement. The recommenda tions of tbe secretary will. I do not doabr. re ceive the friendly consideration of congress, for ho basen Jovt. as be bas deserve 1, fsiio con fidence of ail those interested m the develop ment ot enr-navywunom any division npon partisan lines..

I bave several times baen called npon to re move Indian agents appointed by me and have done so promptly upon every sustained com plaint of unfitness or misconduct. I believe, however, tbat the Indian service at ths agencies has been improved, and is now ad ministered, on tbe wbole, with s'good degree of efficiency. If any legislation is possible by which the selection of Indian agents can be wholly removed from all partisan suggestion and consideration, I am sure It wonld bs a great relief to the executive and a great ben efit to the service. the pension bureau. The report of the commissioner of pensions, to wbich extended notice is given by tbe secre tary of tbe interior in his report, will attract groat attention. Jndged by th aggregate amount of work done tbe last year baa been the greatest in tbe history of the office. I believe that tbe organization of tbe officers is efficient and tbat tbe work bas baen don with fidelity. Ths passsgs of what is known as - the disability law has, as was foreseen, very largely Increased tha annual disbursements to tbe disabled vet erans of tho civil war. Ths estimate for this fiscal year was $144,956,000, and that amount was appropriated. A deficiency amounting to $10,058,621 must be provided for at this session. The estimate for pensions for the fiscal year ending Jnne 30, 1894. is S16",003,000. Tba commissioner of pensions believes that, if the present - legislation and methods ars main tained, and fnrtber additions to the pension laws are not made, the maximum expenditure for pensions will be reached June 3 J, 1891, and will be at tha highest point, $188,003,000 per an num. the agricultural department. Tbe report of the secretary of agriculture contains not only a most interesting statement of the progressive and valuable work dons under ths administration of Secretary Busk, but many a-iggestions for tbe enlarged useful ness of this important department. In tba successful effort to break down the restric tions to tbe frea introduction of our meat prod -nets in tha countries of Earopa, the secretary bas bean untiring from the : first, stimulating and aiding all other government officers, st noma and aorcd, whose official du ties enabled thsm to participate in tno work. Tbe total trad a in bog products with Europe in May, 1892. amounted to 82.000.000 pounds, against IK.90000 in the same month of 1891; in June. 182, the exports aggregated 05.000.000 pounds, against 49,000,000 pounds ia the same montb of tho pre vious year; In July there wss an increase of 41 per cent, and in August of 55 pr cent, over the corresponding months of 1891. Over 40,000,000 pounds of inspected pork bsve been exported since the law was put in opera tion, and a comparison of the fonr months of May, Jnne. July and Augnst, 1892, with tho same months of 1891 shows an increase in the number of pounds of our export of nork products of 62 per cent., and an incrsass in value of MS1 dot cent. Tbe exports of dressed beef increased from 137,800,000 pounds in 1889 to 220.500.001 pounds in 1892. or about 60 par cent. During tha past year there bays been exported 394.607 bead of cattle against 205.78a exported in 1889. Thi increased exportation ess Dean largely promoted bv the insneotlon authorized by law and the faithful efforts of the secretary and his efficient subordinate to maks tnat inspection thorough and to carefully ex- elude from all cargoes diseased or suspected cattle.
