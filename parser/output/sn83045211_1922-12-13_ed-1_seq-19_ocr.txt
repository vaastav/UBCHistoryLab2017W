Samuel (lorn (lern per.", president of the American Fed Fed erullen of Laber, frankly told the Heme Judiciary Committee today that the. Executive Commlttee of the fed eration hud authorized the employment of counsel te nsslst Representative Kel ler, Minnesota, in presecuting1 Impeach ment proceedings ngeinst Attorney Gen eral Daughcrty. Netice was served en the committee by Jacksen II. Italsten, counsel for Representative Keller, that he would insist en his "rights" before the com mittee even if he had te carry his' fight te the IIouue. Mr. Balaton's announcement came lifter it had been decided te keep out of the record certain newspaper articles relating te W. J. Hums, chief of the Uurcau of Investigation of the Depart ment of Justice, until members of the committee could have opportunity te examine them. Representative Yates, Illinois, asked if that was te be considered as a threat te the committee. When Mr. Ralston entered n diHclalmcr Mr. Yates de clared he considered It was a threat te the committee. When Mr. Ralston entered a disclaimer Mr. Yates declared he considered it was u threat. Rcpre--sentatlvu Graham, Pennsylvania, as serted that if n threat wbb intended he for ene would refuse te hear Mr. Ralston further. The Incident was closed nnd the hear ing proceeded with a suggestion by Rep resentative Fester, Ohie, that the committee get along with its work. The newspaper articles in dispute were frcnt te President Harding last October by A. P. Macauly, an Ameri can citizen living nt Terente, Canadn, along with n letter protesting against the eppeintment of Mr. Burns by Mr. Daughcrty. The letter was referred te tlie Attorney General, who replied te Mr. Macauly that he had hnd before him the information sent the President before Mr. Kurn.s was appointed, that he had known Mr. Burns for many, many years nnd was "quite mire he will render me nnd the Administration faithful nnd efficient service." , : Inspectors Admit Geed in Changes CentlntiMl from Pace One prison guards have been scrutinized by the jurors.

The "clean-up" nt the Philadelphia County Prison ordered bv Dr. Baldy is te be extended te c.vcry county jail In Pennsylvania. , Raldy's Action Praised Albert II. Votaw, cecretary of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, ucclaiined Dr. Bnldy's order as one of the grentest forward htcps in the century-old history of penal reform movements. Fer some time Mr. Votaw has been in constant communication with Dr. Baldy and ether State officials in an effort te get modern methods introduced into nil the county prisons of the State. In the opinion of Mr. Votaw, the most important feature of the order iw that calling en the prison inspectors te provide work for the prisoners wherever possible. He stated yesterday that cmple.wnent has been found te be the greut solvent of nearly all prison ills. "The Pennsylvania Society wus in favor of solitary confinement 130 vents age," said Mr. Votaw, "but since' then it lias learned that there is a better method of handling prisoners. We de net object new te congregate labor. We knew that prisoners must be given employment and cxerclbe. "Dr. llnldy knows whnt he wants, nnd the society will de nil in its power te support him in his efforts te get it. The order te the inspectors nt Helmes -burg Is a step in the right direction. It will go a long way toward solution of the evils that all authorities have recognized." Hopes for Improvement Mrs. Harrison S. Merris, one of the, most nctive of prison reform worked in Philadelphia, expressed the hope that the order issued by Dr. Baldy would be npniled te every jail In the Stntc. "If that order is corned out it will represent a remarkable victory for the Kvenine Puome Li:nel:n," said Mrs. Merris yesterday. "Tliose of us who hnve been active in this work for ears are inclined te be pessimistic. We enn recall previous campaigns In which disgraceful conditions were exposed, but nothing ever whs done. "The dark cells, the solitary Idleness, represent the worst feature of the pun ishment nt Helmcsburg. It has been proved that such treatment weakens the minds of prisoners, and surely no one can justify such results. Heretofore there has been no way te step such treatment, because the men in charge have Insisted that no change in their methods W11H nwOHl!irv f Llnninl.. hepe tlint the order by Dr. Baldy will be carried out te the last detail, and that it will he applied te every prUen in the State."

S. -British Agreement Rumored Fer some time rumors hnve been going around here of a common policy te be egrecd upon between this country and Great Britain, the two lending na tions during the war, with reference te the borrowings of France, Itnly and the ether Continental allies from both of them. Great Britain, It is conceded, has arranged te pay her debt te the United States. Her commission whicii will negotiate terms will start for here en December 27. but this is tee Inte for the nrrangeraent of any common policy en ether debts which. might have any bearing en the cenferene of the allied premiers, which will meet en January 2. Presumably some efforts will be made te reach an understanding en this ques tion of European borrowings, exclusive of Great Britain's debt te this coun try, before the reparations crisis comes te a head once mere at the beginning of the new year. One thing seems certain. The Administration Is faced with the neces sity of making some mere practical con tribution te the settlement of the European controversy this time than It hns ever yet done. Its nttttudc was defined in n note of Mr. Hughes, accepting the invita tion te send a representative te the Allied Supreme Council in May, 1021. Mc Hughes wrote : "The Government of the United States, while maintaining the tradi tional policy of abstention from par ticipation in matters of distinctly European concern, Is deeply Interested in the proper economic adjustments an I in the just settlcment of raattcts of world-wide importance, which are under discussion nt these conferences, nnd desires helpfully te co-epernte In the deliberations upon these questions."

The "Tiger's" farewell message te America wtis given out In the form of two telegrams one te Woodrew Wil Wil eon and one le Otte Knhn, banker, in answer te farewell messages which It was said were typical of thousands received at the last minute.

Bruneri Defendants Will Deny Plots Centlnned from Pace One of sleep away when Powell was al lowed te handle the murder gun ; nnd showed hew be had broken nnd leaded it. When he had given it back te Mr. Kcewn the latter tried te take it apart, te show hew it had been put in the linek of Melir's "flivver" seddun, but failed. Welter Wills, foreman of the jury, and a veteran of many hunt ing beasens, took the gun from him nnd showed him hew te de it. Then every body settled down for another nap. Powell is Deliberate Mr. Keown resumed Ills cress-examination by asking: "Can jeu tell me today why you killed Jehn Bruncn';" "On account of Harry Mehr," Powell answered deliberately. "When and why did von nsk Mm authorities te let you go en the stand and testify?" "I nbked te go en te defend myself; I don't knew when 1 asked." At this point Mr. Kcewn tiled in confuse the witness by refcrrhig te his ii-Miiiuuii.v in ycsiiviiny mat no induce ment hud been offered te him for his testimony. Have you net en ether occasions said tthnt the authorities had made premises te you that if veu testifip,! according te the statement you made you would get your liberty?" asked Mr. Keown. The State objected but was over ruled. Powell uuswered "Ne" with emphasis. "Have you net sold you would he out et jail utter Uliristiuits?" "Ne." "Have ou net said you would be out of jail after Mehr and Mrs. Bruncn had been tried and that you -would cat Christmas dinner with your wife?" Au objection by the Stnte te this line of questioning was sustained. "Have jeu net been told by officers of the State ns te the punishment j-eu would get if you testified in accordance with the statement jeu made te De tective Parker?" An objection wns sustained. Doesn't Knew His Fate The question was them amended as fellows : "Has Detective Parker. Prosecutor Ivelsey or Assistant Prosecutor Pea cock ever told you what punishment would be given jeu if you testified ac cording te your statement te Parker''" Powell answered "Ne." Mr. Kcewn hen asked questions about Powell a connection with Bru nen's circus, apparently for the pur pose of Indicating that the witness had quarreled with Bruncn. Powell de nied that this was se. "Did Ham Mehr tell vnn ii.-. ti. Urunen had been complaining about your drinking and didn't he say that if you did net btep drinking and make n full accounting you could net stay with the show?" "Mr. Mehr told me lets of thln-s uuuui mini iiiuiiuu uau sam, but Bruncn himself never said any of these things te me." At this point Prosecutor Kclsev nres te object, hut Detective Parker U go him and bald: "Let him go en let him go en." Justice Knlisch ruled, however, that he line of questioning had been fol lowed far enough.

Says Penrose Sought Meney Frem Grundy Continued from Pnae One was called te the stand. He were n snugly fitting tweed suit of a light mixture. "Did you knew Senater Penrose?" asked Mr. Gilfillan. "Yes, I had political relations with him since 1830," replied Mr. Baker. "What de you knew of tills claim?" "It was December 10. 1021, that I had a conference with Senater Pn Pn rese and he told me he owed 'Judge' Cunningham between $35,000 and $40,000." "Did you call en the Senater te dis cuss this matter?" "I hnd talked te the Senater nnd told him I was going te quit politics in rennsylvanln because I could net live en whnt I wns gcttlne." Mr. Jenes asked the witness te give tietniis et the discussion in which tlie Cunninghnm claim was mentioned. "This discussion about the claim did net come outef the clear sky, did It Mr. Baker?" asked Mr. Jenes. Wanted Grundy te Collect Meney The State chairman said he would rather net sny anything about the '.dis cussion "but I suppose I will hove te." Continuing, he said : "The Senater asked me te see Mr. Grundy becnuse his relations with Mr. Grundy were rather strained at the time, lie wanted me te see if Mr. Grundy would collect the money te pay the claim. "I never had nn opportunity of see ing Mr. Grundy befere the Senater died and I did net get the money from him." Here Mr. Gilfillan nddresscd the court, remarking he could net call Mr. Cunningham as a witness because of the Senater's death. "But I would like It noted en the record," he went en, "thut Mr. Cun ningham is here te tell of the date and the amounts In which the menev was raied." Mr. Gilfillan paused, turned toward the spectators and then looked at the courtrem clock. Important Witness Absent "I expected an important person here from New Yerk." lie explained te Judge Gummey. "He knows all about this affair. He was n member of the notional committee. Hn wnc i, i... fore, your Hener. I had trouble get ting him, but he wns here en Decern - her 4, when I was tied up en the Chandler case and we couldn't ee en 1 1I011 t knew whether his absence new means he wants te. get away from the case or whether he bes been caught by pressure of businebs." Mr. Jenes asked who the witness is and was told "a business man of New lerk." "These are what I call tender financial arrangements, with net any persons present," continued Mr. Gil iilliin. Mr. Jenes said he was willing te have a continuance if the New Yerk nuui mum in- preuueeu inter. Jude Gummey .-aid if the witness were hrmighf in he would be glad te hear his testimony. , 'i1 "1,,l1Ir;?n1 ct ulm 0' right, Judge, said Gilfillan. "Very well, then, we will adjourn te such tunc as you can arrange te get the witness." said .Tudge Gumey. Before tlie adjournment wns ordered, however, Gilfillan called Mr. Tavler te the stand. He testified he had been Senater Penrose's secretory since 1014 "Did you have any record of pev-' ments made by the Senater In thn hitter part of his life?" "He didn't keep books," replied Mr Tayler. "De nu have any record of a pay ment miiile bj the Senater te Mr. Cun ningham?" "I hinen't any record of the Senater hating paid Mr. Cunninghnm." On cress. examination, Mr. Tayler was nsked if he has talked te Penrese regurnng tne innuer. Mr. Gilfillan objected but wns overruled, "Clean Sheet," Senater Said "I don't remember the date," said Tayler. "The Senater's liablt was te take up with me en Sunday mornings matters that had accumulated during the week. He did this before going out drhlng. One .Suiulnj, about the middle 01 .-Nevenuier, iiui, the Senater said Tin ler, I don't Knew what mil' happen, but no matter whnt may hap pen, we are nil cleaned up.' "The Senater." resumed Mr. Tnv lnr, "then turned ever a number of papers, nene of them representing claims except whnt I called the Cun-nlngliBin-Griindy clnim. The Senater said : 'I urn a happy man ; we have 11 clean Bheet and cun stnrt out new,' "I said te him : 'Senater, whnt about the Cunninghnm clnim?' " 'That's nil right,' the Senater re piled," said Mr. Tayler. He ndded that Penrose hnd stated the Cunning ham claim hed been taken care of and thut he had a clean sheet. The bearing then wns continued te n date te be agreed upon later b i-eiiusel. Later Mr. Cunningham snld- "1 had an appointment with Senater" Peniese for thn last week in Decern, her, 1021. or the first week In Jnnu ary of this yenr te talk ever payment of the claim. The Senater died en the hiht day of the jenr. Had he lived there would have been no question about! my getting the money. tmJ affair Is just part et the fortunes of political life."
