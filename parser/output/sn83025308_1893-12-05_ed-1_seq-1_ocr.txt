Dee, #.-The Alnt eante asuion of the Firty-third eonresle assem bled at noon. On many desks were floral tributes from admirers of the respective oe copents. Vice President Stevenson had been remembered with a large baseket of roses. The galleries were well filled, and a touoh of color was lent )b the sene by the bright winter toilets of the ladies present. After the viee-president's gavel fell the blind chaplain was led to the desl and de livered an eloquent prayerr The roll call showed fifty-six senators present. After the usual opening formalities the oommittee to wait on the president sa nounced the acoomplishment of its duty and that the president would at ones communi cats with the senate. BSecretary Pruden then stepoed forward aend delivered the message to the vioe-presi. dent, who laid it before the senate, and Secretarr Cox at once began its reading. All present, with few exceptions, gave close attention when the reading began. These was a general changing about in esete of senators when that portion of the document dealing with Hawaii was ap proached. Many senators had, however, nntieipated the secretary's reading by turning in their printed copies. After this there was en evident falling of in the in terest of senators, but attention was briefly revived when the paragraph concerning bonds was reached. When this was passed the senators eradually left their seats and drifted into the cloakrooms, so that by the time the reading was two-thirds conaluded only twenty-five senators were in the chamber, and a majority of these were en gaged in conversation among themselves. TIB 

HOUSE, There Were 240 Members Present-The Galeleies Pilled. WAemaooro Dec. 12.-The galleries were filled when Speaker Crisp rapped the house to order at noon with 240 members in their seats. 1B. E. bagby, the chaplain, offered prayer. The committee on appropriations asked unanimous consent for the consideration of eMill apprepriating .:$.000 additional to, pay the salaries o offioials engaged in the enforbement of the Chinese deportation and registration aet. Agreed to. Hines,of Pennsylvania asked enanimous con sent for the consideration of a resolu tion for the aprointment of a committee to investigate the Lehigh railway strike. Kil gore, of Texas, objected, and the resolution was referred. At 1:25 the committee to wait on the rresident reported its duty disoharged and that the president would shortly commun! cats with the house in writing. Ten minutes later Secretary Pruden ap peared with the message and Clerk Kerr began to read it. The reading was listoned to with marked attention. Duaring the reading of the first portion of the message, relating to our foreign rela tions. Ez-Speaker Thomas B. Reed burst th ough the side door and came running 1o oss the area in front of the speaker's rostrum. When he reached his seat he deliberately lighted a oigar and sat puffiag away complacently while the reading pro ceeded. As rhe reference to the Hawaiian sfaire was reachsed the members straiaht ened up and arve the closset possible at tention, but no expression either of ap proval or disapproval was Indulged in. There seemed to be a general air of disap pointment, however, that so little space was allotted to the question. The recommendations relative to the in. ternational monetary conference, and the request for further authority for the issue of bonds, caused many significant shakes of the head nn the part of the extreme lil ver men. The 'relsident's bold endorse ment of the rension polley of the Interior department, of civil service reform, and his appeal for rigideconomy in epp opriations, also attracted attention. When the refer enoe to the tariff was reahebed the members crowded about the clerk's desk. His force ful utteranoe relative to the duty of con gress on the tariff, aend the hearty endorse ment given the Wilson bill, seemed to please the demooratil members greatly, but much surprise was evi. dent when the seootion of the message was read stating that the walys nd means committee had embraced in its Iplan several additional internal revenue taxes, and a small tax on the incomes of certaln orpo Sations. As it was understood the internal revenue features and income tax had noet been absolutely deoided upon, the prosi dent's annosneement camse in the nature of a surprise. A roar of applause grested the conolusion of the reading.

BEAUDET ON THE STAMI' She Begins Wee story of ner Ire"s tioes With Landmasa. LouIse Benldet, the mselir, went on the wIaemne stand in the Uited Stalne dt1111 reoterday to tell of her treassetlosl With Daniel Bandmana, the tragedian. and why she should have a hare In all the property whiekh e bhd bought with the joint prEo I of their several theatrical venasare, Ms Beandet is a rapid talker, s rapid In. faSt that Stenographer Hnmburger feond it C dif.oult task to keep up with er. He 0et all the words down, but that kept him so bnuy that he did not .neueed in etcbleRi the vr.red theatrical gestures with whiek she embeililhed her flow of language. While the Juliet of former histrionat efrorts uered out he tale of woe to a s ympp tbetfe audieneo, her erstwhile otoreo at near his counsel and either miled sa. eastieally or grinned aardonieally, a thinu that Bomeo never did behind the footlighte. Mis Deaudet wase armed with a head estehel full of documents, and as any par ticular one was wanted she glided grae fully from the witness chair end souat(,t out from among the bunch. If the deao ment did not happen to be just there ehe would consult her memory by placing a neatly gloved hand over her eyse and shut ting of the outside world while she re seliod the inoident by a chain of oeneomlt. ant olroumetsanes; and meantime Romeo smiled and smiled, like one who '"Jeeeat sears, that never felt a woend." Miss Beadet's testimony was in reti: that when she went with Bandmnan to Australil the agreement was that she was to get a stated salary per week and an equal share of the profits. At her benelie abe was to get everything after dedusting expenses. She declared that she was de voted to her art and had worked hard to provide a home for her mother and esister. oer success in Australia, she said, was phe nomnal. Miss Beandet was provided with detailed statements as to the amounts ad vanoed her from time to time. From 1888 to 1889 the whole time they were together, she said the entire amount of money she aot wee $10,181.25 including personal ex exponges Obarged up to her, medieai attend anos, money advanced to her mother sad sister, eto. This included the Australian, Chinese, Indian, etc., trip, trips to Europe, as well as stors in America. In addition to this Bandmann invested £160 in one thing and £600 in another for her in Australia. She declared that $20,000 would represent the profits of the Australian trip alone. Speaking of one of their trips to Europe, when they produced "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" for two eonseootive nights in Lon don, when they were stopped by injunction, she said they didn't lose much on that, as they had good houses while is lasted. After they were enjoined she said Bsndmann fled to France to avoid arrest at the instance of his wife. To prevent his wardrobe being seized he distributed it among the trunks of the different members of his company. In that part of his clothes placed in her trunk she had lately found a number of let ters and documents, whioh she handed to the court and fileds as exhibits. Asthe midwnlter darkness descended over the eeort room and the electrio ights were turned on, Judge Knowles suspended fur ther prooeedings for the time, the deen ments were gathered up, and the sudione filed out, to await till "joound day stance, tiptoe on the misty morning tops" and brings all the actors in this Montana drama of reetitutlon together again.

ANINUAL STATE PAPER President Cleveland's Message Dis. ousses Many Subjects Now, of National Interest. Recommendations of the Depart ments Are Endorsed and Others Made. Poeley of the Adminletratlone n the ia waelia Matter-Tbe Wilson Tarlff nill Advoeated. WAsanewrow, Dee &.-The presedent'a messea, read before congress to-day, is as follows: The Congreuaof the United States: The eonatitatienaa duty Which requires the presideont fromt time to time to give to the ebnsgeOe informuation of the states of the nalon. and roeonmend to their considras lea sunoh legislation as he shall judge necessary. is fittingly entered upon by 9ommeaoding to the congress a eareful son *ideration of the detailed etatemente and well supported reoommendations contained an the reports of the departments, who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the goverameat. In an effort to abridge Ibis communication as much as sl con lastent with its purpose, I shall supple. sent a brief referenoe to the contents of the depar$mental reports by the mention of snch executive businea and incidents as are not embraced therein, and by such resommendations as appear to be at this particular time appropriate. While our foreign relations hive not at li times doring the past year been en tirely free from perplexing, no embarassing situatitoe-remadn that will not yield to a spirit of fairness and love of justice, whiobh, joined with consistent tirmness, oharacterize a truly American policy. The oatbreak of, domestio hostilities in the repalie of Brazil found the United Statesaleyt to watch the interests of our eltizens in that country, with which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of our new navy are now and for some time have been, stationed at Ri de Janseiro. The struggle being between the established government, which oLttrols the machinery of administration and with whioh we maintain friendly rela tien and certain offileers of the navy em ploying the vessels of their command in an attack ppon the national capital and chlef seaport, and lsacking as it does the elements of a divided administration I have failed to eeo thit the insurgents can reasonably claim teeognition as belligerents. Em phasistpg our flxed poulry of impartial atrallty In. f tion of effaire as 'now jitt Inris a ltneaasary to disa vow 11i amanaer -noet to be misunderstood, the unauthorized saction of oar late naval commander of these waters in saluting the revolted Brazilian admiral, being ladie posed to countenance an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to the local insur reetios. The convention between our government and Chili, having for its object the settle ment and adjustment of the demands of the two countries against each other, has been been made etiective by the organization of the claims commssion provided for. The two governments faliang to agree upon the third member of the commission the geod ofleies of the president of the Swias repub lic were invoked, as provided ii the treaty, and the seleotion of the Swislls representa tive in this country to complete the organi zation was gratifying to the United States and Chili. The vexatious question of so-called legs tion asylums for offenders against the state and Its laws was presented anew in ChObili by the unauthorized action of the late United States minister in receiving in his ofmolel residence two persons who had failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal eharges were pending, growing out of a former abortive disturbance. The doctrine of asylum as applied to this case is not sanetioned by the best preced ent, and when allowed, tends to encourage sedition and strife. Under no eircum stanoes can the representative of this gov ernment be permitted, under the ill-defined fletion of extraterritorialty, to interrupt the administration of criminal justice in the countries to which they were accredited. A temperate demand having been made by the Ohilean government for the correstion of this conduct, in the instance mentioned, the minister was instructed no longer to harbor the offender. The legislation of last year known as the Geary law. requiring the registration of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the United States, and the deportation of all not complying with the prevision of the act within the time described, met with much opposition from Chinamen in this country. Acting upon the advice of emi nent coansl that the law was uneeunlitn tionsl, the great mass of Chinese laborers, pending judicial inquiry as to its validity, in goel faith declined to apply for the certificates requred by its Iprvislone. A test wasb ought before the supreme ceart and decision made sustainiag the law. It is bhelisved that under the resent amend meat of the act extending the time for re(istration, the Chinese laborers thereto entitled, who desire to reside in this eoun try, wlinow avail themselves of the re newed privilege thusne affoded. The qOuetions affeeting oar relationse with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friondtines. Negotiations are in ero greos betweern the two governments with a view to suoh ooncurrent action as will make the award end regulations agroed upon by the BerinR see tribunal of arbitra tion practicaly effotive, end it is not doubted that Great ritalsn will ou-orerate freely with this coauntry for the sccomp ltshment of that purpose. Requests for additions to the list of extraditable offences covered by the oesetnlg treaty between the two countries is under aonsideration. Our relation with Meileo coatlnnes to be of that olosae and friendly nataue whish should always characterire the intoroulase of twratierabboring republics. The work of reloeatinag the monuaments marking the boundary betweena the countries from Paso del Norto to the Pacilo is now nesarly com- plated. Th e commission recently organ rz-d under the conventions ef 1884 ned 1889, it is expected, will speedily settle dis pates growiug out of the shifting corrents of the uo Gando river east of EL Paro. The Nicrague Canal. company has un fortueately become finanoially socrionsly embarmued, but a generone treatment has been extended to it br the goveornment of Niearege, The United States are ee peoially nterested in the enocestful echieve ment of the vast undertaking this company has in chres. Trhet it should be ascom plished ader diLstinotively Amerleian san spices and It enjoyment asured not only to the vesels of this couontry as a obhannel of ceoaaereial commnialontrlon between our Atlantis and Pacific essebords, hbut the shine of the world, in the intereats of civ ilisatlone, is' a propodilon whieh in my jdjdmeat, does not admit of question. More than fifteen yearels ago this govern ment preft*ed a claim against Spain in be half of one of our itIhzen.l for properly eeized and confscated in Cob.. In 18t; the latim was adjusted. Spain egreetng to p~ lteOaditionaLly as a fair lndemnity U0.uw &A lperotful bht earnest note was recently addressed to the Spanish gov- . ernment insiatloR aoon prompt fulfillment of its long-neglected obligation, Other claims preferred by the United States egainst ipsin in behalf of Amertesa citl zene for property cosiseated in Olab have been pending for many years. Important matters have demanded atten tion in our relations with the Ottoman norte. The firing and partial destruetion, by an unruetralned mob, of one of the shbeol bulldiuge of Anatoly college, etsab lished by oltisens of the United ltatee at Marsovan, and the apparent indifference of the Turkish government to the eoutrage, autwitbetauding the complielty of some of s its officals, called for earnest remon strance, which was followed by promises of reparation and the punishment of the of fenders. Indemnity for the tnjured and permission to rebuild were given, registra tion of the school property in the name eof the Amerloar owners secured, and efficient C proteetion guaranteed. Bince the passage of the sot of March 8, 1808, authorizing the president to raise the grade of our envoys to eorres.end with the rank with which foreign aeountries eeredit their agents here, Great Britain, Fraece, Italy and Oprmany have conferred upon their representatives at this capitol the title of ambassador, and I have responded by so crediting the agents of the United ttates in I those countries with the same title. A like elevation of milioen is annoneed by 1ar ste, and when made will be similarly met. This step fittinlly comports with the posi tion the United ltates hold in the family of t nationa Daring my former administration I took occasion to recommend a recast of the laws relating to the consular service, in order that it might become amore effieientageney in the promotion of the interests it was in tended to subserve. The duties and powers of consals have been expanded with the prowing requirements of our foreign trade, discharging important duties affecting our commerce and Amerclan citizens abrod, I and in eertain countries exercising judicial I fenetions. These officers should be men of character, intelligence and ability. 

HAWAIL A Speclal Messaxe Will Be seat to Con gress on the Subject. It is hardly necessary for me to state that questions arising from our relations with I Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment. Just prior to the installation of the present I administration the existing government of Hawall had been suddenly overthrown, and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated between the provisional government of the islands and the United htate and submit ted to the senate for ratifclation. This treaty I withdrew for examination and dis patohed Hon. James H. Blount, of Georgiea to Honolulu as a special commissioner to snake an impartial iavestigation of the cir oumstances attending the ckange of gov ernment and of all the conditions bheating upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive exami nation Mr. Blount submitted to me his re port, showing beyond all question that thd constitutional government of Hawail had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government, and through the intlmidation caused by the oresesne of an armed naval force of the United States, which was landed for that purpose and at the instance of our miniate-. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me that..the, only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those repre senting us, and to restore as far as prsetl eable the state of affairs existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of acomplishing this result within the constitutional limits of execo tive power, and recognizing all our obligations end responsibilities growing eat of any changed conditions brought about by oar unjustifiable inter ference. our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instructions to this end. Thus far informatien of the accom plishment of any definite results has not been received fIom him. Additional ad vices are soon expected. When received they will be promptly sent to congress, to gether with all other information at hand, accompanied by a speoial executive mes sage fully detailing the ot necessaeery to a complete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all the materi:l r.ents leading up to the present situation.

IALKLU FREELY ABOUT IT, Members of the House and Senate Disouss the Message Very Readily. Tom B. Reed Heads the List With a Charaoteristio Sort of Plaint. Others Vary I. Their Estimate of the Dee umneat Largely According to Polls4 Scant AflUliatieon. WAsaxoToxr, Dec. 4.-The views of the members of both houses ooneerning the message are freely expressed. Ex-Speaker Reed said: "It is Ie eedingly disappoint tsg, both in matter and manner. On the Hawaiian question we are left as much in the dark as ever, and must await news by next steamer, just as we have beeoon witin so long. That part of the message which relates to the tariff asseverates that the house committee in oharge of that subject has formulated plans and devised methods of tnxatine which, as a member of the com mittee, I have not even heard proposed. It is a rather onnusal sensation to learn the deeds of a committee not in a committe room, but from the prelident of the United States, Has that committee ceased in form to be composed of both parties, and has it, without even the formality of a word in open committee, informed the president of its determination in such way that the president can officially communicate it to the house? How long has it been a part of our system that a committee of an inde pendent branch, and abshove all the com mittee which controls the purse, shall re port to congress through the president? "Is this the result of the rumored blend inl of the appointive with .the legislative power? It is bad enough to have a tariff bill made up by a little coterie, but to have it communicated to the president before it reoasehes even the committee, still less the house, shows a determination to be moved by no facts and modified by no arguments, which makes apparent the absurdity of ap oointing republicans on the committee of ways and means at all." Mr. tIpringer approved the refereane to Hawaii as the only course consistent with interastional honor and comity. Holmas-"An able and foralble docan ment." MeCreary-"Able and appropriate.'" Dolliver, of Iowa-"Wanting in definlte ne.s, and makes no pretense to leadeship of publio opinion." Wilson. of West Yirginla-"The uesage is all right." Tracy, of New York-"'Hsrtilylh secord with It." Gear. of Iowa-"The president gives away the ways and means committee on the in come tax; will restore LilinokaIsnl, and agrees wish Hssiock that the tariff i a loorl issue." Bynum. of Indiana-"Clear and eosilse statement." Boutelle-"First eoxecutive document which charages a United 8states minister with malfeassane nad treason." Payne. of New York-"Remarkably die appointing document." Dingley, of Maine-'Voluminous and wearisome." Dsalzll. of Pennsylvanias-The portion on tariff shows that facts weigh nothing with tariff reformers." Hepburn, of Iowa-"Diseussion of the Hawlian policy is disappointing." Yoorheoe, of Indiana--"ln the main a sound strong dooument." McPherson--"Exellent oal the way throulh." Murhyo , of New York-"It is a good message." Palmer-"Tke president's impressilons are wilde of the mark regarding fraudulent pensions." Kyle- Pleased with the inoome tax por tion, but not about Hawaii and the isea ance of bonds." Morrill-"Indorsement of a tariff bill not yet acted upon in the committee is un expeetoed and remarkable." Hoar - "Treats important quostions feebly and briefly. Reference to the tari report isa breach of privilegle." Mitehell- 'upriaed to learn that the restoration of Queen Lilinokalent is really contemplatod." Hlawley-'Laeks vigor and is a disap pointmenot." .Dubois~-"Lsaokng in force, strength and Americanism." Jones, of Nevada-"No hope for silver while the present administration is in power." Platt-"Searseiy deserves comment." Sheup-"Disappointed at the absence of any recommendation of the recognitIon of silver." Dixon-"Wearisome, without suggestions as to the immediate interests of the coun try." Among the senators who declined to ex rdes their views were Sherman. Aldrloh, ill, of New York, Daniel, Mills, Coke, Jones. of Arkansas, Cookeell. Smith, Bar ris and Walthall. Barrison Will not Disotss I1 IsnrtwPoLte, Doc. 4.-Ex-Prelident Har rtison declined to talk on the messae. "The impropriety ot an ex.president dis uessing publioly a president's message," said he. '"is very palpable, and 1 do not care to do so, I am a ropubliian and President Oleveland is a democrat, consequently we dlfer radisally in vioew and opinions, and his sauggestions and recommendatlone are not in acordense with my ideas. I notien. however, that he goes down the line of the departments and treate of them fully. Its length, too, is greater than the average mesIag."
