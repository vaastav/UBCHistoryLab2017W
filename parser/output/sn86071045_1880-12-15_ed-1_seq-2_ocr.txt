JOUN HAI.L has been re-ap pointed Marshal of the United State.- Courts for the Western District ofj Pennsylvania. Coi RT this week is engaged in the trial of criminal cases, Judges Bredin and Storey occupying the Bench. Pro ceedings uext week. MR. ROBERT LINCOLN, sou of the j martyred President, received more votes than any other candidate as a Presidential Elector in Illinois. THE revenue to the United States derived from the tax on spirits and to bacco amounted to about a hundred millions of dollars during the past year. MB. FBANKI.IN JAMISON, of Alleghe ny township, wa £ appointed foreman of the Grand Jnry Inst week instead of Mr. Westerman, who became too ill to attend Court. FOR pensions, including the amount paid for arrears of pensions under the late law, there was paid during the past fiscal year the large sum of nearly fifty-seven millions o r dollars. THE Republican Committee of Mont gomery county met iu session last •week and passed a resolution instruct ing the Senator and members from that county to vote for Mr Grow for U. S. Senator. The delegation from the county is one senator and five members, making six additional votes for Grow. His friends now claim his election certain. He is undoubtedly the popular favorite, taking the State all over. "FORTR&VENUE ONLY." After the experience of the late elec tion one would have supposed that the tariff question was pretty well settled, and that we would not soon have heard again of the "for revenue only" princi ple. But not so. On the very first day of Congress last week a leading Demo crat introduced a bill of that principle, and declared it his intention to urge it and make the Pennsylvania and all other Democrats show their hands for or against it. He declares it the true Democratic doctrine and appears dis posed to have it continued as an issue in our politics. Of him it may be said "whom the Gods wish to destroy they first make mad." PRESIDE TVT HAY ES. In another place will be found a syn opsis of President Hayes' late annual message to Congress, together with ex tract:; from the same on some interest ing subjects. This is the last annual message the President can deliver, and he takes occasion to give what may be regarded as a general review of the policy of his administration. There is no doubt that it has been one of singu lar purity, honesty and fidelity to the public interest, and will go down and be recorded in history as such. Com pared with the closing scenes of some former administrations it stands out iu striking contract. There are but one or two questions dealt upon in his late message that there exists any differ ence of opinion upon. His civil service ideas would seem to be impracticable in this country where we have parties, and where the successful party expect, and, in one sense, have the right to fill the offices. The object is good if it could be enforced from the highest to the lowest office. But to merely estab lish it for minor places in the Govern ment always seemed to ns of but little public benefit. The retirement of the legal tender currency, or greenbacks, is another question that the majority of his party and of the country would likely differ with him upon. Although issued as a war measure, as he states, yet their convenience and use are such that it would difficult to see how we could get along without them. Nothing bet ter could lie substituted a paper money and what is singular the President points out no substitute for them. That currency is firmly secured, of great con venience and general use, and in our opiuion should be maintained and con tinued as the liest and safest paper money we ever had and as an actual necessity to the people. DO 

THEY MEAN TROUBLE ? We can hardi v believe that the Dem ocrats in Congress mean trouble, by calling up, on the Bret day of the meet ing of that body last week, a resolu tion relative to the counting of the electoral votes next February. Yet it looks as if something was intended, from the effort made to force it through on such short notice. It is true there is an obscurity in the language of the Constitution of the United States as to KAO or how the electoral votes of the different States shall "be counted." They are "directed to the President of the Senate," who, "in the presence of the Senate and House shall open all the certificates, and the votes shall UMHI tie counted." Now it would seem to be intended, and seem to be in ac cordance with all our daily transactions of life, that the person or officer to whom any papers or documents are "directed" is the person who has the right to open them and make known their contents. This would seem to give the Vice President the power to have those votes "counted " But, in asmuch as they are required to be open ed "in the presence of the Senate and House," that would also seem as if those two bodies had some power ami rights as to the proper counting of the votes. There wps no difficulty silica jbe ORIGIN of the GOVERNMENT until tbt*J election of 1870, four years ago, which was- avoidtd by the creation, it will be recollected, of the Electoral Coromis n. Then there were double sets of returns fri.m some of the States, which threatened trouble. But now there are uo fuch returns, as yet known. And hence there would seem to be no reason for the action now pressed in Congress by the Democratic members j thereof. The pending bill gives either branch. Senate or House, the right to ! object to any return from any State. ' and prevent it from being "counted." i This would certainly be dangerous aud i unwise. Both Houses should concur at least before t e vote of any State was refused for any cause. But time should be taken and the Constitution either amended entirely, or a perfect , bill matured ar.d passed to remedy the present uncertainty in the language of the Constitution. THE public debt is stili a billion, eight hundred and eighty-six milllions of ; dollars. President Hayes speaks of it in his late message to Congress as fol lows : "The debt of the United States, le»s cash in the Treasury and exclusive of accruing interest, attained its maximum of 52,756,431,571.43 in August, 18C5, and has since that time been reduced to $1,886,019,504.65. Of the principal debt, $108,758,100 has been paid since March 1, 1877, effecting an annual sav ing of interest of $6,107,593. The bur den of interest has also been diminish ed by the sale of bonds bearing a low rate of interest, and the applica ion of the proceeds to the redemption of bonds bearing a higher rate. The annual sav ing thus secured since March 1, 1877, is *14,290,453 50. Within a short period over six hun drt d mil i ns of five and six per cent, bonds will become redeemable. This presents a very favorable opportunity not only to further reduce the principal of the debt, but also to reduce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid. I call the attention cf Con gress to the views expressed on this subject by th • Secretary of the Treasu ry in his annual report, and recommend prompt legislation, to enable the Treas ury Department to complete the refund ing of the debt which is about to ma ture." 

OCOD NEWS, IF TRUE. The following from the Pittsburgh Commercial Gazelle is good railroad news, and we hope it may all soon come to pass. The Baltimore and Ohio road has for years been seeking connections north, and if this effort suc ceeds Butler county will he unanimous in its favor. The Gazette says : "The rumor that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company was interest ed in the combination .made by the Pittsburgh, Titusville it Buffalo Rail road with other corporations, to build a direct line to Pittsburgh from the Ti tusville system, receives corroboration, from the fact that the Baltimore & Ohio have had ax-orps of engineers for nearly two months surveying a route across the eastern part of Allegheny county, from Nine Mile run, on the Monongahela river, to Xeglev's run, on the Allegheny river. At the latter point the new railroad will bridge the river and the Allegheny Valley Rail road North of the Allegheny river the road will run north from Sharps burg an;l Pine Creek, and up Conuo quenessing Creek The necessary con necting road will be about forty miles long, and will strike the New York, Pennsylvania fi Ohio Railroad proba bly at New Hope or Hilliard, in the northern part of Butler county. Hil liard is the eastern terminus of the Shcnango and Allegheny division of the New York, Pennsylvania Ac Ohio Railroad, and from New Hope there is almost an air line to Cleveland by the Mahoning division. The line from Nine Mile run to the Allegheny river was run more than ten years ago, and the surveyors have found m ny of the old stakes which had i>een put in. It is expected that the Baltimore <fc Ohio Company will build the branch, but not before spring. The matter will be discussed at the annual meeting to be held in this city to-day, and then the Baltimore directors will make a person al inspection of the proposed route. 

PRESIDENT HAYES refers to the transmission of power in our Govern ment from one Administration to another, as illustrating the beauty and stability of our institutions : The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election of Chief .Magistrate has afford ed another opportunity to the people of the United States to exhibit to the world a significant example of the peaceful and safe transmission of the power and authority of government from the public servants whose terms of office are about to expire to their newly chosen successors. This exam ple cannot fail to impress profoundly thoughtful people of other countries with the advantages which [Republican institutions afford The immediate, general and cheerful acquiescence of all good citizens in the result of the elec tion gives gratifying assura: ee to our country, and to its friend* throughout the world, that a govern merit based on the free consent of an intelligent ami patriotic people possesses elements '.-I strength, stability and permanency not found in any other form of govern ment." The following is his mode for the suppression of polygamy : It is the recognized duly and purpose of the ]>eople of the United States to suppress polygamy where it now exists in onr Territories, and to prevent its extension. Faithful and zealous efforts have pecn made by the United States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws it. Kxperience has shown that the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires extensive modifica tion and amendment. The longer ac tion Is delayed the more difficult it will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Mormon sectarian or ganization which upholds polygamy has the whole power of making and executing the local legislation of the Territory. I>y its control of the grand and petit juries it possesses large in fluence over the administration of jus tice. Kxereising, as the heads of this sect do, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to make effec tive their hostility to the law of Con gress on the subject of polygamy, au<J iu fact, do pftrvcut its eufbrbemcut. Qtifje ©itiseu: ta, ISStJ. Polygamy will not be abolished if the enforcement of the law depends on those who practice ami upnold tie crime. It can only be suppressed by taking- away the political power of the sect which encourages and sustains it. The power of Congress to enact suit able laws to protect the Territories is ample. It is not a case for half-way measures. The political power of the Mormon sect is increasing; it controls j now one of our wealthiest and most populous Territories. It is extending ■ steadily into other Territories. Wher ever it goes it establishes polygamy and sectarian political power. The sanctity ot marriage and the family relation are the corner-stones ofj our American society and civilization. Re ligious liberty and the separation r»f j Church and State are among the ele-j mentary ideas of free institutions. To | re-establish the interests and principles j which polygamy and Mormonism have j imperiled," and to fully reopen to intel- | ligent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part of our domain which has been, iu a great degree, closed to general immigration by intolerant and immoral institutions, it is recommend ed that the government of the Territory of Utah be reorganized. I recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a Uover ncr and Judges, or Commissioners, ap pointed by the President and confirm ed by the Senate-a government analo gous to the provisional government established for the Territory northwest ol the Ohio, by the ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is deemed > est to con tinue the existing form of local govern ment, I recommend that the right to vote, hold office and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah, be confined to those who neither practice nor uphold polyga my. If thorough measures are adopt ed, it is believed that within a few years the evils which now afflict Utah will be eradicated, and that this Terri tory will in good time become one of the most prosperous and attractive of the new States of the Union." A Synopsis of Tha President's Mes sage. In his message the President refer to the late election, denouncing the Southern States for fraudulently count ing out the votes ot the negroes, thus virtually disfranchising them. He asks for the abolishment of sectional issues. He speaks of the necessity of a general system of education in the South, urging that Congress shall make ap propriations to this end and establish Federal supervision over the expendi ture of such grants as it may make. In the South the means at the com mand of the local and state authorities are in many cases wholly inadequate to furnish free instruction to all who need it. Whatever the government can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to be done. Wherever general education is found, peace, virtue and social order prevhil, and civil and religious liberty are secure. lie reviews at some length the suc cess which he believes has been attain ed during his administration in improv ing the tone ar.d efficiency of the civil service. The danger of patronage, or appointments for personal or partisan considera ions, have been strengthened by observation and experience in the executive office, and 1 believe these dangers threaten the stability of the government. The reasons are impera tive for the adoption of fixed rules for the regulation of appointments, promo tions, and removals, establishing a uni form method, having exclusively in view, in every instance, the attainment of the best qualificat otis for the posi tion in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens, and the most economical and efficient administration of the pub lic business. In several of the depart ments he says they have tried the com petitive mode of appointment, and it has wonderfully benefitted the service ; so a method which has so approved itself by experimental test at points where such tests may be fairly consid ered conclusive, should be extended to all subordinate positions under the government. He recommends an annual appro priation of $25,000 to pay the expenses of a commission whose duty it shall be to devi.-u a just system of competitive examinations throughout the country for applicants for the service, which would relieve the president and con gressmen greatly. The first step in the reform of the civil service must be a complete divorce between congress and the executive 111 the matter of ap pointments. The corrupting principle that "to victors belong the spoils," is inseparable from congressional patron age as t he established rule and" practice of parties in power. The question of polygamy in Utah has also a share of attention. He heartily denounces the "crying evil," and asks for the abolishment of the ; "crime." Our foreign relations have been good. He refers to the fisheries question, the firing on Ann r can vessels in Cuban waters, and says that these matters are approaching a settlement The President considers it as one of the striking successes of his administra tion that resumption has been accom- j plitb'd and maintained, and the country I brought out of thi- disasters following ] the panic. lie calls attention to the fact that J the legislation ol the last congress in regard to silver has failed to produce tlje effect then predicted The United .States produces more silv r than any other country, and is dnucjjy jjjtffested in maintaining it as one of the precious metals. He recommends the legislation for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, and ask* for liberal appropria tions for this purpose, He recommends the completion of the new war department building, and the erection of a lire-proof building for the army m -dical museum and library. He commends to the attention of congress the great services of the com mander-in-chief of our armies during ' the war for the union, whose wise, firm and pitriotic conduct did so luupU !<l bring that momentous conflict to a close. The legislation of the United States cont ins many precedents for the recognition of distinguished mili- ; tary merit, authorizing rauk and emol uments to Is; conferred for eminent services to the country. A'» act of con gress authorizing the appointment of u captain-general of the army, with suit able provisions relating to a compensa tion, retirement and other details, would, in my judgment, be altogether fittimr and proper, and be warmly ap proved by the country. He recommends the establishment of American linys of steamers to yurry the TUails between our tfwa pWrts 'and j those of Mexico, Central America, Suit! America, and trans-Pacific coun tries. He leeoniaienda the attorney-gen eral's suggestion for tiie establishment of an immediate court of errors and ap peals, j He advises : '.f increase of schools for Indian education, a> much g >od is j accomplished thereby. He recommends that provisions be made for the sale of abandoned posts, the proceeds to be applied to establish ing new posts. McCandless, Pa., Dec. G, r BO.
