WEDNESDAY DECEIitRKR 8 ,1919 The most I can do for nig friend is simply to he his friend. — Thokeau. PRESIDENT S MESSAGE PRESIDENT WILSON, in his message to Congress, saddling upon "the government" respon sibility for much of the unrest now prevalent in the country, should not j forget that the government includes : the President himself as well as the j Sen&te, and that if it is the duty of , the Senate to get quickly down to j a peace-making basis, it is the duty of the executive to meet that body j half-way. There can be no ques- < tion that the final settlement of the 1 war, so far as we are concerned, and the resumption of peace-time rela tions abroad will liolp considerably in the return to normal conditions, but it is evident that there qnust be , concessions on both sides before that desirable end can be reached. The President's message deals generally with labor legislation, the tariff, assistance for soldiers and the protection of the dye and related chemical industries from German aggression, and his remarks on this last-named subject indicate that he I is not so certain as some of his other j utterances might seem to indicate, • about the effectiveness of his League 1 of Nations in keeping the peace of j the world. Indeed, he makes it very clear that he would have the coun- { try well prepared for eventualities j of a world-wide character. Most of the President's address ; Is, as usual, of an academic nature. ; He writes well and in a manner to win the approval of his readers until > they begin to analyze the document for practical suggestions. Then they I find that he has few to offer. He is I a past master in the gentle art of essay writing and as an author ol glittering generalities he is the su- j perior even of Lloyd George in the j politics of to-day. But he has made ! a practical recommendation of more than passing importance when he j advocates the creation of a perma- 1 nent government body for the arbi- j tration of all disputes between cap- ; ital and labor, and he certainly has , the support of a great majority of [ the people of America when he as- ] jerts that the government always . must be superior to any class and is justified in stepping in at any time j to protect the paramount rights of the public. And he is in full accord with public opinion when lie says , that privilege in America can never \ be permitted to transcend the rights of the people as a whole. The President's advocacy of the budget system for the government ; goes back to the time of President j Taft, and smacks strongly of the recommendations urged upon Con- j press by Senator Penrose in a vigor ous address last Spring. It is timely j and ought to have the early con- j rideration of the legislative bodies. Mr. "Wilson speaks also In the lan- i guage of Senator Penrose, as chair- i man of the finance committee of the i Senate, when he pleads for the re- I vision and simplification of the in rotne and excess profits tax laws, | *nd urges Congress to give earl j ' thought to the changes that must i t>e made for the safeguarding of I business in peace times against the > rigors of wartime legal regulation, j That is Republican doctrine, pure I sod simple. Evidently Mr. Wilson, j while shut up in his room, has kep' ; bis ears open to the sentiment of the 1 sountry and has gone to consider able pains to prepare his message accordingly. j Communities consist not simply of 1 • uildings and parks and utilities: i ihey are people and friendliness and j inselfiahness.

GOOD BUSINESS THE Dauphin County Prlsuu Board's decision not to fill the place of a resigned store keeper, whose duties it was found could be performed by another em ploye, indicates that its members interested more in the business man agement of prison affairs than they are in giving salaried places to po litical friends. Also, the falling off in prisoners by more than 100 a day and the consequent savings to the taxpayers are proof positive that prohibition does pay from the money stand point, because jail-keep is only a small item in the cost of arresting and trying of prisoners, and the economies effected by having 100 less men in jail every day in the year with prohibition in force is an argument in its favor that oppon ents of the new constitutional amendment will have some difficulty in meeting, we imagine. The action of the Prison Board in doing away with an unnecessary office is proof positive that county offices are in good hands, for there is nothing more tempting for the man in public place than the con tinuation of conditions as he finds them, especially when to do so per mits him to favor a friend who has favored hini politically. it is a good sign when officials find it in their hearts to reduce working forces. J Chester and many other cities are I giving serious attention to the houa jing problem, which confronts most J cities ajni towns, and llarrisburg is ia'so being given careful study by an able Chamber of Commerce commit [tee. Composed of careful and compe tent business men, this committee is investigating every angle of the mat- ! ter with a view to making - some recommendations and taking such fic tion as seems justified under the cir cumstances. PROFIT-SHARING GEORGE W. PERKINS writes an interesting article in the current issue of Rotarian j Magazine, entitled "The Workers' l-'air Share," in which he devotes | considerable attention to profit • sharing. At first thought profit-sharing • would seem to lie a ready solu tion to the industrial unrest now prevailing, inducing the worker to produce as much as possible in the j hope of sharing in the profits, the same as stockholders. But there are two sides to pro fit-sharing. as there are to every other proposal. The stockholders of a company share in the profits only when there are profits to share. There are lean j years even Wi.h prosperous ( panics, when there are not only no [earnings, but where losses actu j ally are shouldered either by J necessity or for the future good of ithe concern. In sueli cases, what would the i worker do who depended upon pro [ fit-sharing for a part of his yearly | income ? i Say lie worked hard and really i produced much more than he i would under the present wage sys : tent. Say he hud no responsibil j ity for the failure of the company !to earn a dividend, would it be fair to him to tell him there were no profits in which lie could share? And if this situation were to oe i cur, as it is bound to do wher i ever profit-sharing is attempted, I how is it going to be adjusted? rrolit-sharing is a very fine thing t when business is booming, but it j doesn't look so good from the ! other angle. Harrisburg and Dauphin county are | going to take their places on the fir jing line in the Red Cross Christmas seal campaign next week. The lines [of strategy have been discussed by ( the committees and all is in readiness ! for the sale of the seal which wili .provide the ammunition for fighting the White Plague. A NEW 

JOURNAL WE RECOMMEND to our read ers a new publication, Tlio New American Citizen, the j first number of which lias just come from the press. It is published in six [languages, the first page in English and the oilier live each a duplicate | of the first, except jn a different i language, it is sane, sensible and [patriotic, its objects tire summed [up in its own editorial introduction: The founders of the New Anter- J iean Citizen recognizing the inc-f --i fcctuul labors of well meaning, i although illy-equipped, persons who are trying to solve indus trial problems, have stepped into i the breach fully equipped by edu j cation and long experience in dealing with workingmen and I foreigners determined to secure | for llie workingmen. botn Amer ) iean and foreign their rights, i while at the same time recogniz | ing and safeguarding the rights of the employing interests, i Only by intelligent co-operation between employe and employer, j can America's most important ' industrial problems l.e solved.

The publishers set themselves to the task witli eonscietice and vigor, feeling confident• that sub stantial benefits will be derived by both the employer and the em ploye. if "The New American Citizen" continues ast well as it has begun It will deserve the attention it no doubt will receive: It has iTi it great possibilities ns an Amertcunisutloa agent- folitUo U "~PIH.H44{6KUU<I Bjr the Ex-Committeeman tlltiiough the Constitutional Re vision Commission is to be a strictly nonpartisan affair, the work which it will undertake is looming very large in the political discussions of the day and there have been suggestions without number as to the alterations which should be made in the docu ment. None of these, however, is likely to assume a partisan form and the general expectation is that there wilt he no attempts to inject political discussions. Attorney General W ilium I. Schaf fer's hope is that tile sessions of the Commission will be marked by ex peditious but dignified handling of the important subjects which will be considered. The opening next Tues day will be attended by a short cere mony and Mr. Sehuffer will outline the desire of the Governor, who will not be able to get here in time fo attend the inauguration of the work, but who will probably visit the Com mission later on in the week. First lubors will be in studying the constitution and deciding upon what sections should be changed. This will take several weeks of hard work by the committees. —The Philadelphia Inquirer gives considerable attention to the plans j for the new Commission and says that one of the big subjects will be taxation of natural resources, in cluding a tax on coal. It also pre dicts that there will be important changes relative to the appropria tions for hospitals and other sub jects which will enable charitable grants to be put into general bills instead of having a separate list. Most important, the Inquirer says, will be the municipal features. It remarks: "Philadelphia, and in fact every other city in the State, will demand that the Constitution lie changed so as to grant a greater degree of home rule. It is pointed out that the mayor of New York has a veto power over all legislation en | acted by the General Assembly of j the Empire State at Albany, which directly affects that municipality. I The recent experience at llarrisburg in the enactment of the new charter for the Quaker City, with the mem bers from other counties than Phila delphia, who controlled the situation, ' being dragged and hauled about by I ihe runners of rival political fac tions from this city, was such as to demand, relief from these objection able conditions. The classification of cities as at present has been found to lie unsatisfactory and a proposi tion has been advanced for the specification by name of the city to be directly affected by any proposed legislation. While Philadelphia is [the only "first class" city in the ! 1 'ommonwealth, there are two second j class cities. Pittsburgh and Scranton. [ These municipalities, so widely ■separated and located at the extreme western and eastern portions of the State, respectively, under the exist ing constitutional restrictions are ob liged to work upon the same charter and other legislative conditions. What has been deemed desirable in Pittsburgh has not always been ac ceptable or workable in Scranton, and each of these cities will seek to provide for a sepuwuie legislative program of its own. The third class cities have an organization which | will no doubt appoint a committee jto make such recommendations to j the Constitutional Revision Commit)-: i sion as may be desirable." —Auditor General Charles A. Sny der will begin his strenuous task of selecting the mercantile appraisers litis month. There have been many rumors about men to be named, hut the Auditor General has kept his counsel. There will be something like 100 appointments made. —Col. George Xox McCain, writ ing in the Evening Public Ledger, makes some sharp criticism of State departmental report publication methods. He says: "The lack of ready-to-hand information in all de partments at llarrisburg lias been notorious for a quarter of a century. 'Hie State's publications are never up to date. Department reports find their way into the hands of the pub lic years after they have been com piled. with one exception—Smull's Legislative Handbook. It is usually ready for distribution a few months after the close of the legislative ses sion, which is due to the untiring ef forts of Senate Librarian Miller. The new Commissioner of Labor and In dustry, Doctor Connelly, I have no doubt, so far us his department is concerned, will speed up in this re spect. for he has come lo tbe work with a great record for efficiency." —This year it does not look a-s though the proofs for Smull's hand book would be ready much before Christmas and the 1919 book, for which copy was prepared long ago, will appear in 1920. The last re port of the Adjutant General is dated around 1914. There are other departmental reports, copy for which was ready promptly, which are away late. —Mifflin county Republicans are likely to have a legislative contest on their hands. Representative C. G. Corbin wants to run for the Sen ate and some people in Lewistown district want to run for the House. —Representative William J. 11c- C'aig, chairman of the House Ap propriations Committee, will be a candidate for re-election next year in Pittsburgh. —Ex-Representative Ellsworth G. M. Kulins, one of the orators a few sessions ago. is lo be clerk to the Lehigh county comtnissioers. —School boards reorganizations took place pretty generally through out the State on Monday and for once there are no reports of lie votes and controversies over the con trol of hoards. Comparatively few changes In officers were made. —From all accounts the census supervisors are not going to have the easy time anticipated in getting enumerators for the decennial job. At first it was thought that there would lie many places for deserving Democrats, but Ihe Democrats did not seem lo like lite prospects of pay or work in many districts and even in such rock-ribbed sections as Berks and Lehigh the Democratic bosses are wondering why the faith ful will not take Hie jobs which Ihey say can he had. —From all accounts the changes In lite Scranton city and Lackawanna county government ate tfoing to he pretty thorough.

New York World recently published an editor ial tiiat certainly should stir all law abiding persons to the point of de manding a show down of these sleek, well-fed individuals who deal in slime qnd filth, and who hope, under the cover of anauymity, to use the anarchistic press io aid in dragging the Government of the United States down into the mire of Bolshevism. We have laws especially intended to prevent persons from remaining unknown while doing suclt things. I/et us enforce these laws to the last letter, to the end that the printing press shall not be used in this coun try against Hie forces of law and order. The World says on this matter: "Of the anarchistic publications in this city, most of them in foreign languages, the state authorities claim to have proof that about twenty-live are kept alive by the subsidies* of 'one hundred or more men and women of the parlor Bol shevik type and a few wealthy men and women against •whom there previously had heen no suspicion of radical tendencies." it is promised that the list will lie made public soon. Accepting the truth of this state ment, the guilt of the conductors of such organs of violence and plunder may not be confined to their preach ments. A few enacted by Congress in 191"2 and fully sustained by the Su preme Court in 1913 requires semi annual sworn statements front the publishers of all newspapers and periodicals, giving the names of edi tors. own'ers, stockholders and bond holders. Possibly these patrons of anarchy think they do not figure in any of the capacities mentioned, being only contributing editors, so to speak, but failure to name them constitutes at least a violation of the spioit of the act. If their money does in fact keep the lawless press alive, they are more accurately to be described as its owners than tlie agitators who thrive on their bounty. On puin or fine and imprison ment.

A policy to which no honest journal or peri odical can object certainly ought to be serviceable In the cases of pub lications blatantly devoted to revo lution by force and pillage. We should have the names of all such benefactors of Bolshevism— first, for wholesome publicity, and secondly, for such responsibility under violated law as the courts shall determine.

Every man knows who lias ever been respons ible for a piece of work, or had lo meet a payroll. Recently' another friend of mine built a house. The money to build it represented a difficult period of saving on the part of himself and his wife; it meant overtime work and self-denial, and extra effort in behalf of a long-cherished dream. One day when the work was well along, he visited it, and saw a work man climbing a Jadder to the roof with a little bunch of shingles in his hands. "Look here," the foreman cried, "can't you carry a whole bundle of shingles?" The workman regarded limt sul lenly. "1 sup poke I could." he answered, "if 1 wanted to bull the job." By "hull the job" lie meunt "do an honest day's work." At ten o'clock one morning I met still another man in his office in New York.

Roosevelt and Japan 6 In an article written several months \>efore his death and which has just been published, Theodore Roosevelt said: "There is not time in this message to discuss fully our proper relations to Japan; I have set forth as i see thorn—and as I see our proper posi tion as regards all our international relations —in my book, "Fear God and Take Your Own Part." Rut there is always time to point out (he elemental fact that this country should feel for Japan a peculiar i;d miration and respect, and that one of the cardinal principles of our for eign policy should he to secure and retain her friendship, respect and good will. There is not the slightest real or necessary conflict of interest between the United States and Japan in the Pacific; her interest, is in Asia, ours in America: neither lias any desire or excuse for acquiring territory in the other continent. Japan is playing a great part in the civilized world: a good understand ing between her and the United 1 States is essential to international progress .and it is a grave offense against the United States for any man by word or deed to jeopardize this good understanding."

Tlie man added: "It was >i crime'against Germany." if ii helped Germany, nothing was a crime against France, but tlie German people see that tlie destruction of the French mines at the time it occurred, when the inili tarv party must have seen that they could not win and that they might lose, with .inevitable reparation, meant that the French would insist on tin* surrender.of the coal mines in tlie fjaar f'.asin, at a time when Germany would necessarily be des perately put to it for fuel.

Hamrntg (Eljat Disputes arising: between authori ties of East and West Hanover townships over the dividing line of those districts and reference of the matter to the courts of Dauphin eouhty a few days ago, call to mind the fact lhat these two townships, known colloquially as the Hanovers, bat e had an interesting history front the earliest settlement of what is now the capital county. Although rural entirely, the Hanover district, as it was long called, was settled be fore John Harris got his ferry grant from the I'enns and Conrad Weiser and* the hi shots planned to make i>l id die tow 11 the metropolis of the lower readies of the Susquehanna. Named in honor of the reigning house ol' England, which bore a dis tinctly German name* the Hanover section was settled almost entirely by Scotch Irish and the early days of its civilized life were marked by constant Indian raids and some re , prisals front sturdy pioneers which ; made the redskins dread the very i name of Hanoverrnen. The legends i <>f those early settlements have come ; down through a number of families i which have figured in the history of i Dauphin county, the Simontons, the j Snodgrasses, tlie Wilsons, the Wal laces and others who made their homes in that section and fought Indians or emissaries of those they , deemed oppressers when necessity arose. The Scotch-Irish took re- I ligion and culture into the wilder ness of tliis county just as they did into Northampton, Washington and other Pennsylvania counties, as Han over church and McClure's Academy attest in the annals of this commun ity. It is unfortunate that so much of great historic interest as the story of tile settlement of the Han overs has not been put into more convenient form for reference or in deed for general reading, because there is nothing more inspiring than the story of how the frontier was held right in our own county. The section now known by the llanovers of Dauphin and Lebanon counties was originally a part or' Derry township in Lancaster county. Deny township was one of three formed in 1729 and some call it the premier district of this county. The other two were Paxton and Lebanon. The three of them were all in Lan caster county and now comprise a great part of Dauphin and Lebanon as known for the last century. Derry township seems to have included everything within the present limits of this county which Paxton did not. Hurrlqburg and Steolton are in what used to be called Paxtang or Pcsh tank, or something like that, but which some authorities believe was really Paxton. About ISS years ago there arose a complaint from settlers living north of the Swatara which led to petitions to the court at Lan caster for the formation of a new township, the ancestors of a number of Jlarrisburg l'amifies being signers for that division. The matter dragged along for a couple of years and there must have been many visits paid on horseback to the county seat before it was arranged. There was some rivalry between Derry and Paxton men and the Hanover people were occasionally accused of taking part in it. The court order establishing Hanover township was dated 1739, when part of what is now in Lebanon county's eastern end was made Bethel township. Hanover township lasted in this form until early in v 1785, the year Dauphin county was erected out of Lancaster comprising the present Dauphin and Lebanon counties. Then the Hanover district was divided into blast and West b.v what was called the West Branch of Priest's Itun, which is believed to be Kaccoon creek. A curious fact was that the township docs not seem to have, had any northern boundary and the question whether the First or Second mountain was the line got iijto the courts, and not until years afterwards, in fact about 100 years ago when Rush township was marked out, was the northern line definitely established. When Lebanon county was erected in 1813 there was also a dispute over tile llanovers. Raccoon creek was made a county boundary line, but it; look an official commission, which was named the next year, to estab lish the line between the two coun ties. But this did not end it either, and liiuillv in 1821 the Legislature passed a law that the. certain part known as Fast Hanover should be long to Lebanon county. it ■ also sliced off a part of West Hanover and some of Londonderry, inciden tally. Henceforth, Dauphin had one Hanover and Lebanon hml otic, as the names of townships to-day in dicate. Twenty .years afterwards a. new movement for division began, in the Dauphin Hanover, and b.v one of those omnibus acts which Legis latures of years gone by were so fond of passing and which can be found by wading through some 60 I.sections of an act of March 4, 1542, Hanover township was divided us we know it now. South and East Hanover were formed out of what was commonly known as West Han over to distinguish it from its sister, which had become a part of the Lebanon family. * * * It is the report of the officials named by the Dauphin county court almost eighty years ago that .will have to he referred to by the liti gants in tills latest action, the sec ond to be handled by the court in recent years, as those familiar with the long controversy over Lykens Valley township lines will recall. This report was filed in the office of (lie prothonotary in March, 1842, and mentions the lands of the Fox, Grubb. Simonton, McCord, McFad den and other families, some of which were inherited from men who biased a way into the wilderness and who helped form the Hanover As sociutors and make one of the bright pages of Central Pennsylvania his tory. • When Hanover is mentioned the loyal Dauphin eountian should re call June 4, 1 774. .two years before tlie Declaration of Independence, as the,date when the inhabitants of Hanover township, our county, for mally and in writing, declared the acts of Great Britain "iniquitous and oppressive." Although the shot that, was heard around the world had not been fired in New England, these Pennsylvanians resolved "That in the event of Great Britain at tempt lug to force unjust laws upon us by the strength of a,rms, our cause we leave to Heaven and our rifles," The men who signed that resolution showed the way to their . neighbors of Mlddletown and Hum melstown, who acted within a week, and some of them died it) Washing ton's army, others serving until the end of the struggle at Yorktown. The committee which drew up the papers of the Hanover Associators and placed themselves in danger of their necks were Col. Timothy Green, James Carutliers, Josiah Kspy, Rob ert Dixon. Thomas Oopenhelter, William Clark, James Stewart, Joseph Barnett and John Rogers. They were men who feared no king and who helped make Pennsylvania history. , .
