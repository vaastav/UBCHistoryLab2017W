Jacobs of Rich- - roond Missing Richmond. Dec. 4. The disappear ance of a prominent physician of this villas and Mrs. Rufus E. Brown of Burlington, is the cause of a big sen sation here and throughout the coun ty wbre both parties are well known. It Is alleged that Mrs. Brown left home Nov. 12, giving out that she was going to Montoelier to visit ber husbfthB, Senator Brown, and that she wohld be away two weeks. She basinot returned, neither did ber hus band see her at the Capital. The following day Dr. Charles W. Jacobs of this village also left for parts unknown and a strong chain, it is alleged, of circumstantial evidence points to the fact that the two elopeo together. Neither Senator Brown nor Mrs. Jacobs have any knowledge of the whereabouts of the wife and husband. It is alleged that Dr. Jacobs and Mrs.Brown were lovers in their youth; that he. has since been her family physician; that they have been inti mate' friends, etc. It is not known lust wha't time the intimacy began between him and Mrs. Brown, says the Burlington News. It has been a thorn in the flesh to Mrs. Jacobs for many years A correspondence Is known to have passed between them at more or less regular Intervals for many years. Mrs. Jaeij,)s discovered some of the letters once and chlded her husband for his indiscretion, but Eeemingly to no pur pose. Dr. Jacobs was married to pretty Josie Whitcomb 25 years ago. He was graduated at the medical college with the aid of his wife's money and the two settled down in Richmond where they were born and reared ; the doctor to work up an excellent prac tice and his wife to become an admir able helpmate. Twc children were born to them : two daughters, fair of face and form. They reached woman hood, well educated, and married and settled down. Dr. Jacobs is an ex cellent physician and most skillful surgeon. He is the son of the late Mr. Jacobs ot White River Junction and of Rich mond. His father owned some fine nroperty in this town adjacent to the doctor's spacious home on Main street. This residence and lot at the death ot the old gentleman, which occurred raly last week at White River Junc tion, fell to Charles, the doctor. Mr. Jacobs, senior, leaves a wife but it was bis second, and he and she were not on the best of terms. A year or so ago he left her occupying the home In this viaage which had been tne property of his former wife but of which be had a life lease, it finally be coming the property of his son Charles and went to White River Junction to live. When the remains of the father were brought here for Interment the funeral was held from bis old home despite the efforts of the doctor to have the body brought to his rest dence. As soon as the obsequies were de cently over, Dr. Jacobs gave his brother" Ed.ward, who Is a prosperous Richmond merchant, a power of at torney to dispose of the homestead or take charge of It. 'When the doctor left town it is alleged that he carried away considerable money which was furnished to him on the security or his recently acquired property. The beautiful home In which Mrs. Jacobs resides and which Dr. Jacobs left so suddenly and mysteriously is owned entirely by Mrs. Jacobs who has, It is alleged, practically support ed her husband for a long time. Dr. Jacobs is a medium sized man, 48 years of age. He wears side whisk era and is just the least bit bald. His wife Is a spare woman with good fea tures and very bright blue eyes. Their home is a new dwelling, one of the finest in the village of Rich mond. It Is furnished with every convenience. Tbe property wbloU oarne to the doctor upon the death of his father is valued at 1,500. Mrs. Jacobs has many friends who side with ber and agree that she is not to blame for her husband's actions. The dav that Dr. Jacobs went away it Is alleged he received a message in cipher from Burlington. No one know" what was contained in it but he left seou after its receipt. It was an open secret that be intended going away but everyone thought that be meant to travel on the road as a drum mer. PARLIAMENT NIEET8. London, . Dec. 4.
