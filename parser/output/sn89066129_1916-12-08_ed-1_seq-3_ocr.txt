HE MAKES FE7 SUGGESTIONS , Further -Legislation for Settlement and Regulation of Railway" Labor Dis putes Held Imperatively Neces sary by the chief Magistrate. Washington. Dec. ' 5. The senate and house met In joint session today and heard President Wilson's message, which was as follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the Constitution of com' lmmlcatlng to you from time to time Information of the state of the Union and recommending to your-considera' tlon such legislative measures as may be judged necessary and expedient shall continue the practice, which hope has been acceptable, to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general puh lie policy with which It seems neces sary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my sug gestions as few as possible ; but there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which It seems necessary In the interest of the public to do at once. In the first place, it seems to me Im peratlvely necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had occa sion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the pub lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated difficulties which then existed, and which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First. , First, Immediate provision for the J enlargement 'and administrative reor ganization of the interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In the bill recently passed by the house of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate ; In order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon it with a prompt ness and thoroughness which are, with Its present constitution and means of action, practically impossible. Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages in the employ ment of all railway employees who are Actually engaged In the work of oper ating trains in interstate transporta tion. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of a small hody of men to observe the actual re sults in experience of the adoption of jthe eight-hour . day In railway trans portation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the in terstate commerce commission of an increase of freight rates to meet such Additional expenditures by the rail- toads as may have been rendered nec-' essary by the adoption of the elght rhour day and which have not been offset- by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed justify the increase. " Fifth, an amendment of theexlstlng federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation, and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, In case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fall, a full public Investigation of the- merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgment In the hands, of the executive of lhe power. In case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railroads of the coun try as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use. Renew His Recommendations. . The second and third of these rec ommendations the congress Immediate ly' acted on: it established the eight hour day as the legal basi of' work and wages In train service and It au thorized the appointment of a com mission to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the j measures most immediately seeded; i but it postponed action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate con sideration of them. The fourth rec ommendation I do not deem it neces sary to renew. The power of the in terstate commerce commission to grant an Increase of rates on the ground re ferred to is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the com mission's authority or its inclination to do justice when there Is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions the Increase In the Interstate commerce commis sion's membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary In time of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation Is manifest and pressing. Those who have intrusted us-with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them In 'such matters would find it hard, I believe, to excuse a- failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only does the Interstate com merce commission now find it practi cally impossible, with Its present mem bership and organization, to perform its greatfunctlons promptly and thor oughly, but it is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative instru ment. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion and conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make Immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues Its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its items, the Increase in the effi ciency of the Interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives has already acted; its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue In an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society in do ing so would be to adopt a new prin ciple Into our jurisprudence which I take it for granted we are not prepared to Introduce. But the proposal that the -operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been Instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the in dustrial processes of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between em ployee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an Impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con sider all practicable means of concilia tlon or arbitration. I can see nothing In that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbl trary or unjust in it unless it be arbl' trarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupu lous regard for the interests and liber ties of all concerned as well as for the permanent Interests of society Itself. Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital Importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the nouse or representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in pro moting the foreign commerce of the country than -Is now thought by some Jto be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; the bin amending the present organic law of Porto Rico ; and the bill proposing a more, thor ough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money In elections, com monly called the Corrupt Practices Art. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted Into law. Their urgency lies In the manifest circum stances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but neces sary. . Even delay would seriously jeopard the Interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the till to reg ulate the expenditure of money in elec tions may seem to be less necessary than the Immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer; be cause at least two years will elapse before another election in which fed eral offices are to be filled ; but It would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied In the light of present experience ; and a delay would have the further very se rious disadvantage of postponing ac tion until another election was at hand and -some special object connected with It might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. I shall not argue at length the desir ability of giving a freer hand in the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume, has Indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessary instrumen talities for its prosecution; it is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale under our present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which wllf glvefreedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity Is here and may escape us if we hesitate or delay. Porto Rico's Needs, The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to Rico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not Just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our Intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily re move. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. " Inasmuch a this la, -gentlemen, prob ably the last occasional shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you In the many measures of constructive pol icy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor In such company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare servlceableness and distinction. Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite. Instead of an ax and saw to remove the tops of trees that are to be used as masts in logging operations, dyna mite is used to shoot off the tops. After the branches have been removed, a rigger climbs the tree, with a set of irons, to the point where it is neces sary to cut off the top. Here the trunk Is usually about 12 inches in diame ter. The rigger ties a string of dyna mite cartridges, fastened end to end like sausages, around the trunk at this point, inserts a blasting cap with about 20 feet of fuse In one of these sticks, lights the end of the fuse, and de scends before the explosion takes place. The tree top pumps into the air with the explosion and the trunk Is left ready for attaching the rigging for dragging In and loading the logs. Engineering Record. All He Saw of Battle. The bluejacket had been in the bat tie off Jutland, and in the railway com partment every one addressed him re spectfully. Incidentally he was the recipient of numerous fine cigars. He conducted himself, with becoming dig nity, and when the foreign-looking gen tleman who had kept silent went out at a roadside station the audience set tied down to hear the yarn. Nodding his head' toward the dark stranger on the platform, the bluejacket remarked with a grin, " 'E thinks 'e 'as lost some- think 'e'd like to hear, 'e 'as. But hall Hi saw of the bloody battle-was coal nothing but coal. Hl'm a stoker, yon see, that's what HI am." London Mall. . Not to Be Thought Of. "Now. these fashionable dames don't mind talking freely about the efforts they make to reduce weight. That's true." "But they would feel deeply humili ated if anybody suspected them of try ing to reduce expenses." Unsatisfactory Remedy. Helny A doctor tells me that If a man works steadily he never worries.
