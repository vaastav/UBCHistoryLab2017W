There must have been some telepathic suggestion to reach the public committee room where several idle members were chatting, for suddenly one of them Jumped up, went to the door of the inner chamber, yanked it open and yelled in to the executive session grouch party, "Tiee.

"I.OST. STRAYED OR STOI.KX-ONK I'nited States senator, somewhere between <'olumbia. S. C., and Washington, L?. C." < Such an advertisement would express liir curiosity that has been manifested ' around the Capitol this week as to the whereabouts of Senator Tillman. Somei how or other the Senate doesn't seem lik?- the same place without Soutli Carolina's pitchfork and tire-eating statesman i In his accustomed seat on the center aisle. The reason of all this curiosity is that the newspapers in Columbia announced : last Monday that lie had left for Washington to be present at the opening of : Congress. This report readied his friends hen-, but thus fur there has been no ' SenaXor Tillman anywhere around 'he Capitol. Matters reached such a pass yesterday tna.t people were asking each other if he hud Ireen taken ill again and gone to some hospital en route. Assistant Senate librarian Baker, how- ! ever, was abb* to solve the mystery late in the afternoon. He got a telegram from the senator, sent from Fort Hill, 8. ('. Mr. Tillman said ho had just stopped off to attend a meeting of the board of directors of the agricultural : college at that place. Now, if there is one thing that the noted South Carolinian is interested in more than anything else, barring the official and private arts of President , Roosevelt and the rare question, it Is , agriculture. So his friends are no longer ; j anxious. They say if he shows up some time next month he'll he going some. ( Incidenta'lv It is reported among Mr. Tillman's friends here that lie has re- ] gained practically all of the strength he lust during his severe illness last spring and will be ready to make some of his j old-time speeches again this winter. * | , A man walked up most respectfully to j I the doorkeeper at the entrance to the sen- J titer's private lobby yesterday and handed . ! ' ( in his neatly engraved card, asking that it j be laketi to Senator So-and-so. i "Hush!"' whispered the official, dramat- ' icaliy. "What's the matter?" asked the 1 stranger, with the proper show of excite- ' ment. < "They're reading the President's message." 1 ; "Oh." said the stranger in a most sol-' emu tone. "You see." vouchsafed the official. "The senators arc always so deeply interested > in the communications front the White1 House that they have made it a rule for years never to allow a card to bo sent in ! to them. It might distract tlfir attenlion for a moment." "How appropriate!" whispered the < stranger aim tiptoe away in the gallery i j to hear the message for himself. ( As lie entered the ga'lerv he could scarcely believe his eyes. lie looked all I around the chamber and there were hardly j ; more than a dozen senators in their seat.*. \ Half of these were reading the printed j copies of the message that had been fttr- ' , nished th.etn hy the government printing' office. The other halt were talking and ' laugiiing. Over on the sofas in the cor- i tiers there were groups of them, and they ' , were chatting In a most unconcerned man nrr. Through the cloakroom doors cnrne visions of open tiros and b^g ' hairs pulled ; up in front, and now and tin n a sugges- ' ' tton of mirth. I ' The cle.'k was droning something, the s'rnnctr couldn't make out just what. ; There surely must he sonte mistake, he j ' thought, and hastened hack downstairs j to the doorkeeper. ' ' "It's finished." he w oispered?"the IIP s- : sage. 1 mean. Will you take my card in . now?" |j "Oh. ro." announced the official, "it j' vti'l !a*' for .Mother hour yet. Yo:i'U hi;'.- to wait, tte careful and don't tall; i 1 t co loud. You 'night disturb them in there." i ] When last seen the strange man was" i Walking slov.lv toward tee outside door.
