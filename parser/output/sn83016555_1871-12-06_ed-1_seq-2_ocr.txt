Why was Moses the wickedest man that ever lived? Be cause he'broke all the ten commandments at once. ___ The coldest weather in New Orleans re. ported thus far this season was during the nightof Monday last, when the thermometer was down to 26°. ^___ The Vicksburg Times says Governor Powers has removed Dr. C. A. Poster as mayor of that'ciiy, and appointed General J. C. Webber. The Opelousas Journal says: "From what we can learn, sugar cane iu this parish is now yielding about one hogshead and a half to the acre.'' The new geographies will have to state that the principal industry of Muscatine, Indiana, is the manufacture of "sour krout,*' which is shipped down the river. At a Louisville ball a waggish youth took out the bam from the sandwiches and sub. stituted slices of soap therefor. The result may be imagined. He was lathered. Mr. Walton. Administrator of Finance, gives notice that he is ready to receive pro Isteals, until the sixteenth, for the sale to the city of seven wharf improvement bonds. _ Clayton Crawford Gillespie, son of Colonel C. C. Gillespie, of the Houston Union, died at the residence of his father last Saturday morning, after a long ill ness. _ % A wife in Davenport, Iowa, who wouldn't endure her drunken and abusive husband any longer, took advantage of his absence one day, and sold out their household goods and disappeared with the proceeds. Leave of absence has been granted by Governor Warmoth to J. Jules, Clerk of the District Court for the Ninth Judicial District, Bossier parish, for fifteen days, commencing on the fourth instant. The great sale of the blooded stock of the Fair Grounds stock farm will positively take place this day, at half-past ten o'clock, at the Stonewall Jackson stables, No. 134 Garonne street, by Messrs. Montgomery. We have received from C. S. Sauvmet, Ksq., a pamphlet report of the decision of the Supreme Court of Louisiana in the case of C. S. Sauvinet vs. J. A. Walker. It is neatly printed, and useful for reference. An oyster supper for the benefit of the Ladies' Missionary Society of the Coliseum place Baptist church will be given at the church on Thursday and Friday evenings « f this week. Tickets one dollar. A pleasant party is expected. The cold was so intense here Monday night that in some sections of the city i :e was formed, and the spigots of cisterns were frozen tight. Growing vegetation suf fered extensively, and only the hardiest plants survived the frosty ordeal. Young ladies who think Dame Nature has not made their eyes sufficiently bright, endeavor to enhance their brilliancy by having belladonna dropped into their eyes, or by blackening the lower eyelid, which has the effect of making them look large and full. Governor Warmoth lias made the follow ing appointments: J. H. Kingsley, police juror for Jefferson parish, right bank; Robert Ilaismet, justice of the peace for the third ward of Natchitoches parish: Jonas Hughes, justice of the peace for the second ward of Ascension parish. King John, of Saxony, is said to bear a striking resemblance to the General Robert Anderson, of Fort Sumter fame. The king spends most of his time in making transla tions from the French, English and Italian poeta. The older he grows—he will be seventy next month—the more attached he becomes to literature. The President has appointed C. W. Bab cock, Surveyor General of Kansas, General W. Vandever, of Iowa, and N. Hilton, of St. Louis, Missouri, United States Commis sioners to examine and report upon the road and telegraph line of the Kansas and Texas Railway Company in the Indian Ter ritory. Messrs. Louis Stsrn &. Brothers will sell to-day, at ten o'clock, at No. 16 Chartres street, one thousand cases boots, shoes and brogans, and five hundred dozen ladies', misses' and children's Philadelphia manu factured congress gaiters, polish and button boots. This will be an unreserved credit sale, and dealers will do well to attend it. Tbe head waiter at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, John McBride, has, perhaps, one of the largest hotel acquaintances of any one in the country, salary $100. John shakes bands with President Grant and Senator Conkling as if be was a brother. The sec ond is Thomas Gay. There are eighty waiters who receive from $28 to $30 per month. _ Wc omitted to say that the compliment of a ro-elcction was paid by the members of Louisiana Hose Company Company to C. Madden, president; J. Yalets, secretary; Dan Malone, treasurer: Alfred McLean, second assistant foreman, and C. Madden, delegate to the Firemen's Charitable Asso ciation. The compliment of a re-election by the members of Louisiana Hose Com pany is justly considered one of the highest that can be bestowed.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. This document waa received by Con gress on Monday, and copies of it trans mitted by telegraph were published by the press of this city yesterday morning. Its hurried transmission by telegraph has undoubtedly caused inaccuracies in copies thus obtained that do not appear in the original. As a public document, the message is not without merit iu a literary point of view, and chief in this respect is its simplicity of style. This, though not enriched with the higher graces of composition, will be admired because it can be understood. It is an improve ment, we think, on the style of state papers in general, which are too apt to be couched in high sounding words and cun ningly devised sentences that are intended to conceal rather than make known mat ters of public interest. The last message of President Grant is a plain, straightforward statement of the condition of our foreign and domestic affairs, together with such suggestions and recommendations to Congress as are deemed important to the best interests of tbe country. The President sets out by informing Congress that success has gen erally attended the efforts of the govern ment during the past year to execute the laws. He says "the policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom of the laws already enacted, but to learn their spirit and intent, and to enforce them accord ingly." This is a most excellent policy, and one that can not fail to be followed by good results when carried out. Tbe example set by President Grant in this respect is worthy of imitation. It should be followed by all Jwho are intrusted by the people with the power and duty of enforcing the laws. The President ac knowledges, in befitting terms, the gen eral prosperity of the nation during the past year, and refers in like manner to afflictions that have visited the land dur ing the same period, in the loss of life and property by fire and storm. He is inclined to regard these afflictions in the light of chastisements; and as this implies wickedness, let us hope it will have a tendency to to make our people mend their wicked ways. The peaceful settle ment of our disputes with England is re ferred to with much satisfaction by tbe President, and the civilized world will agree that if this mode could always be effective in settling disputes between na tions, it would be of vast benefit to man kind in general. There would be no need of standing armies, and the millions of men who are trained to destroy life and property could be added to the list of those who follow industrial pursuits that add to the wealth of the world. The President sends with his message a copy of the treaty with England, and recom mends the necessary legislation to carry it into immediate effect. The condition of our foreign relations is regarded as generally good with all leading powers. Itjis announced in the message that the mixed commission au thorized by Congress for adjudicating upon the claims of citizens of the United States against Spain, growing out of the insurrection in Cuba, has been organized; and reference is made to the fact that "our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in ease it should become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives and property of bona fide American citizens, and to maintain the dignity of the flag.'' The people of this country have long since concluded that action is necessary on the part of the government to put a stop to the bar barous treatment that is too frequently visited upon Americans in Cuba: and the announcement by the President that steps have been taken to prevent this iu the future will be hailed by our countrymen with acclamations of joy. Many of them believe that our government should go further, and demand that the cruelties and oppressions that are heaped upon the natives of Cuba, straggling for liberty, by a foreign power, should be put a stop to. We have no hesitation in saving that it is the duty of our government, acting iu the in terest of humanity, to ask the assistance of all civilized nations in bringing this barbarous war to a close. It can not be regarded otherwise than as a disgrace to this continent that the Spanish govern ment should be permitted to prolong a most cruel war for years that is not only destroying Cuba and the Cubans, but is actually wasting the lives of thousands of Spaniards, who are pressed into the service and sent out to America to seek early graves. The message touches upon many other subjects of interest, and is a document well worthy of the serious consideration of the American people. IN OUR OWN 

DEFENSE. One of the hobbies of tbe Bulletin is the unjustifiable prejudice that the Repub lican is continually slandering the people of Louisiana. This error of our contem porary is either the relic of a mistaken notion that prevailed three years ago, or else it is a conclusion that it borrowed from the Price Current, and which it has forgotten to return. We do not slander the community at all, ns that is neither a disposition with us, nor would it be a de sirable faculty to cultivate. What we do do, however, is to tell the truth rather plainly, which is ofteu mistaken by those to whom it is addressed in friendship as a scandalous proceeding. Every community has its faults, as every family has, and those who commit these faults generally resent being told of their misdeeds. When we say that the Bulletin has been giving the people bad advice ever since its estab lishment, this is not a scandalous asser tion if its truth can be demonstrated, is it ? And when we say that a large constituency of the people have thoughtlessly adopted this advice, what is this but doing a Christian duty by them, if we can estab lish our proposition ? For instance, the Bulletin insisted that the people should ij/uore the Constitu tional Convention and reject its warrants, whereby the expense of that body was doubled. What did it do but perpetrate a senseless and unpatriotic piece of advice ? When it advised the people to disregard the reconstruction laws, and hold in dis repate the constitutional amendments, both of which it now accepts and pleads for, what did it do bat pat the commu nity in a ruinous path ? When it scouted the Legislature and made a laughing stock of the laws, what did it do but sow the seeds of disorder and misfortune? And when the Republican told the people that the advice upon which they were acting would prove ruinous to their best interests, did it not act the part of wisdom and declare the truth in all its parts? The correctness of our past position is defended by the fact that the Bulletin now occupies the identical ground which we occupied three years before it could see the true light Too much violence exists iu society, and this we have reprobated, not to scandalize the community, but to correct the evil. Too much dishonesiy exists in politics on both sides, and this we have attempted to reform, not because our assertion of its existence slandered the people, but be cause the fact darkened their reputation and injured their interests. Prejudice has been used to elevate bad men to office, and this we have pointed to as an evil that needed extirpation before reform could be attempted with success. In all these matters our voice has been that of admonition, and not of enmity. If the head of a family says to his children that they are extravagant and thoughtless, does this lesson amount to a slander against his loved ones ? If a friend says to his associate "You drink too much - you play too much—you consort with evil companions to the ruin of your good name,'' is this slander? If a merchant says to his partner "You are spending too much money—you are investing wildly," is this a calumny ? And yet, because we we have performed this duty, and that, too, against the Bulletin, which has con tinually misled the people into trouble out of which there was no way to extricate except at immense loss, we are denounced as slanderers of the very society that we hopato live with and prosper with. When the Bulletin and its wild and reckless associates counseled desperate and ruinous proceedings, it was doubly our duty to interfere, for the safety of our own friends was involved iu the re sult. No injury can be inflicted on New Orleans that will not fall alike cm us and on our friends as it will upon the pro moters of the evil. It is a law of self defense we follow. If the impracticables only ruined themselves by their impolitic proceedings, we might remain silent; but when their termagant proceedings threaten all fflike with destruction, it is time for every man to defend himself from the reckless Hotspurs who thrust themselves forward • to be the destroyers of a couutrv. CAU8ES AND EFFECTS. It seems that the departments of Lor raine and Alsace, which were sold to Ger many by France, arc afflicted with some lawless spirits who assail and murder German officers appointed to administer the laws therein. This results from pre judice and can only be defended by stupidity, sinee the officers were not responsible for the act of sale, nor will their death alter the status of the com munities in which they were assassinated. If some intelligent newspaper Lad arisen in Alsace and denounced these assassinations as cowardly, and the people that allowed them to be committed their own worst enemies, would that paper have been out lawed as the slanderer of the Alsatians? If that newspaper had told the people fur ther tr.at these unworthy acts would bring martial law upon the state, involving all the people, guilty and innocent alike, under the terrible subjection of the sword, would it have justly subjected itself to the charge of being the enemy of the people whose faults it declared and whose fate it foretold? Hardly. And yet in the United States this is just what has occurred. The South was reconquered into the Union after a long and bitter war, and all human experience justified the govern ment in supposing that the Southern peo ple would feel sore toward the laws that they were forced to accept and toward the officers who represented a power that had beaten them. And since the United States was bound to spread its laws and send its officers over the South, it reserved the right and held in its hands the power to enforce the one and to protect the other. But it apj ealed to the good sense of the people that since they were bound to live in the Union their best policy would be to obey the law and to respect the officer. And for enforcing this sug gestion with might and main, and for urging the people to be good citizens both for their own interest and to pre serve themselves from being visited with rougher usage, which we knew to be in store for the refractory, the Republican press in the South has been derided, scorned and spit upon as the enemy of the very community which it was trying to save. As we can imagine that sensible advice was rejected in Alsace, so we know that it has been rejected in the South, and as the causes were the same so the effects are identical. Martial law has su perseded the milder forms of the civil au thority in South Carolina, and the bay onet sets in judgment on the Ku-Klux in Alsace and Lorraine. We feel a profound pity for both com munities, or rather for that portion of them which condemns private assassina tion as the means to facilitate political de signs; but since they have not heeded good advice, nor defended themselves from evils which they could have avoided by being better citizens, they must bear their load of military rulers as the natural con sequence of their own sins of omission. The Alsatian Ka-Klux was a mere single headed monster compared to our own, and yet King William has gone after it with martial law just as he went for the French at Gravellotte. The Democratic papers are not taking on any airs because the kaiser protects his officers and up holds his laws by the force of a drumhead ccurtmartial. Michigan is infested with a large gang of thieves who steal horses and run them into the neutral ground of Canada. ON CARONDELET STREET. The cotton market is active again, and, by some buyers it is held, rules %c above the figures of Saturday, while others assert the general advance is covered by >4c. The morniug dispatch asserted 22.000 bales were sold iu Liverpool, while New York spoke of a decided improvement; both taken together constituted an impulse up ward not to be resisted. There is no doubt but the sales will reach the highest sold during the present year, if not pass be yond it, inasmuch as buyers are hurrying to fill orders, anticipating a further rise than the day brings forth. It seeuis to be the general impression that tbe present rates, like the last, are but temporary, and that cotton lias reached a line from which it tuay tack and haul lor a moment, but will approach again to its old love. And now upon tbe street comes the Mis sissippi Valley Navigation Company stock, in the hands ox stockholders and stockhold ers' men, and working the late decision of Judge Emerson as a lever with which to "raise tbe wind." In addition, we are told the boat, freighted as it is with the future destinies of the valley is actually (after being in the docks five years) to be launched, and the system is to receive its practical demonstration. Tbe stock yester day scudded before these favorable breezes, but made no landings. The sales are con veniently reported at $5 to $5 25 a share, but as these were the quotations somo time before thp "peremptory mandamus" it can not be bandy to work it off. The bottom to it is beyond soundings. No outsiders have sufficient hardihood to come to the assis tance of the brokers who labored like Trojans to unload, but without avail. Ammonia stayed ill the background modest and unassuming, without canvass ers, apologists or wards. Pneumatic is so far down as to be unnoticed in tbe great whirl of movable stocks in which the street is now merged. Lottery wisely keeps out of the way when its buse inferiors kick up such a dust, and Slaughterhouse is to all intents "withdrawn'' for a rub down until something else beside the shadow of busi ness appears once more. The sole topic outside the ordinary run consists in tin meeting of the Senate, for stock brokers as a class keep posted in current events, and lay by ammunition for use; but at present the market bears Jlie relation to a lively business that a Fourth of July cannona de does to a pitched battle, or a popgun to a mitrailleuse.
