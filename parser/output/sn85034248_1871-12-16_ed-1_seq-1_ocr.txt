A Mississippi journal says: "Snow canme down Tuesday--came down froim the North on the top of a freight train." The North Mississippian, ,md of the ablest Republican journals of Missis sippi, hoists the name of Hon. James L. Alcorn for next Vice President.

The newspapers opposed to the State Administration that are arguing the illegality of the recent extra s*s sion of the State Senate, will do well to note that Senator John Ray, the shining legal light of the Custoca. house faction, introduced a motion to go into an election for a President of the Senate who should be Lieutenant Governor of the State. We warrant there would have been none of this howling about "illegallity" if tbe opponent of Senator Pinchback ) d been successful. The President's Message. The following is a telegraphic syn Sopsis of the Message submitted by the President to Congress, at the begin ning of its present session; The President refers to the gen erally successful execution of the laws, his policy not being to inquire into their wisdom, but to leave time to de velop their intents and wisdom. The disasters by storm and fire in this country have developed a friendship on the part of foreign nations, and do nors will receive the thanks of men, women and children whose sufferings they have relieved. Two countries, speaking the same language, have made a treaty-an example to be fol lowed by other civilized nations, and which may be the means of returning to productive industry millions of men now maintained to settle disputes of nations by the sword and.bayonet. Provision is recommended for the Commission to meet in Geneva, and legislation is recommended to bring into practical effect the questions in the treaity affecting the fisheries and maritime disputes. The Governors of New York, Penn sylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois are requested to take part in measures in the treaty which determines the use of the ca nals by the United States and Great Britain. A true boundary line between the United States and British North American possessions is urged. He recommends the modification of the tariff and internal revenue laws, the taxes from internal sources to be abol ished, except as to liquors 'and tobac co, and these to be the subject of a stamp duty. Our relations with foreign countries are being discussed with the new relations in Italy. A commission has been appointed to adjudicate claims of Americans against Spain, and hope is expressed that the commission will be successful. The visit of Alexis is referred to as evidence of the continued friendly re lations with Russia. The inexcusable conduct of the Russian Minister ren dered his dismissal a matter of self-re pect after his personal abuse of the Government officials, and his persist ent interference in affairs between this afnd other countries. His place has been filled by a gentleman who is not objectionable to this government. Our relations with Japan are amic able, as also with all the 'Eastern countries. The difficulty with China is referred to Congress. The Repub lir of Mexico has not yet repealed the free zone law, and the hope is express ed that Mexico will adopt measures soon to stop the lawlessness on the border. Congress is urged to press the claim for overdue awards of the Venezuela government for 1866. The relations with Brazil will be more cordial since the decree of emancipation by that country, and regret is expressed that Spain has not followed in the same direction in her possessions. It is to be regretted that the dis turbed condition of Cuba is a source of annoyance and anxiety. Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed to spare no effort to protect the lives and property of American citizens and maintain the dignity of our flag. The national debt has been reduced eighty-six millions fifty-seven thou sand one hundred and twenty-six dol lars during the year, and now the in terest accrued is nearly seventeen mil lion dollars less than on the first of March, 1869; but it is not desirable that the present resources of the coun try should continue to be taxed in or der to continue this rapid payment. I recommend all taxes for interest from internal sources be abolished, except those for spirituous, vinous or malt liquors ; tobacco, in its various forms, for stamp duty in readjusting the tariff; articles not produced at home are recommended for the free list, and in case of a further reduction it should be upon articles which can best bear it without disturbing home productions. The present laws for the collection of taxes, with small salaries for col lectors, induce fraud, and should be remiledied. Under the act of March 3d, 1869, each grade in the staff corps should be .fixed in order to enable vacancies to be filled from the same grade. The navy is in an efficient condition without increase or cost of maintain ing it. The union of the postal and tele graph system is recommended. Education is urged as the ground work of republican constitutions. The Ku-Klux laws have been en forced in a portion of South Carolina, and the necessity is shown by the committe to investigate Sourthern out rages, that the power was exercised reluctantly; but a careful examina tion proved the existence of powerful combiuations to deprive the emanci pated class of the substantial benefit of freedom, and of preventing the free political action of those who did not sympathize with their views. In Utah, a remnant of barbarism, repugnant to civilization, decency and the laws, still exists. It is not with the religion or the saint that we deal, but with their practices. They will not be permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion. In fu ture legislation the subject of the plurality of wives and children must be considered, and a bill might be passed to legitimatize all children born prior to the time fixed in the act. The Indian policv has resulted fa vorably, and many tribes have been induced to settle upon reservations. The peace policy is recommended be cause it is right. The retention of lands for actual settlers is again recommended. As six years have clasped since the close of the war, it may be considered whether it is not now time the dis abilities imposed by the Fourtheenth Amendment should be removed. When the purity of the ballot is se cured, majorities are sure to elect of ficers reflecting the views of the ma jority. I do not see the advantage propri ety of excluding men from office mere ly because they were before the rebel lion of standing and character suf ficient to be elected to positions re quiring them to take an oath to sup port the Constitution and admitting to eligibility those entertaining pre cisely the same views, but of less standing in their communities. It may be said the former violated an oath while the latter did not have it in their power to do so. If they had taken this oath it cannot be doubted they would have broken it, as did the former class. If there are any great criminals distingui4ged above all others for the part they took in oppo sition to the Government, they might in the judgment of Congress be ex cluded from such an aimfesty. The condition of the South, is not such as all patriotic citizens can de sire. It will be a happy condition of the country when the old citizens of these States will take an interest in public affairs and tolerate this same freedom of expression and ballot as those entertaining different convic tions. A liberal appropriation is recomend ed to the District of Columbia, to aid local improvements. The erection of public buildings in Chicago is urged. Laws to protect emigrants are sag gested. The Administration has sought to secure honest officials, and, if any dis honest ones have appeared, it is the fault of the system of making appoint ments. The civil service reform is endorsed as calculated to secure the best men. The work of the present corumis sioners is expected to produce good result&. U. S. 

GRANT. tunctuation. a There is great carelessness, if net ignorance, in the matter of punctur tion, iwhereby much misunderstanding arises. Many persons even emulate theancient writers in leaving.out all marls or divisions of any kind, like the barber who wrote over his door: "What do you think I shave you for nothing and give you a drink," which was interpreted by some to imply an easy shave and a morning tipple to be got for the asking. Such, however, was not the meaning of our worthy topsor, who, on being arraingned be fore the magistrate for what seemed a clear case of deception, exelaimed: " What! do you think I shave you for nothing and give you a drink I" Points were filet used by Aristo phanes, a grammarian of Alexandria, 200 years B. C., but were not general ly used until the modern system was introduced at the beginning of the sixteenth century by a learned printer of Venice named Manutius. Punctu ation not only serves to make an author's meaning plain, but often saves it from being entirely miscon ceived. And there are many cases where a change of points completely alters the sentiment. The following anecdote of an English statesman, who once took advantage of this fact to free himself from an embarrassing position, is an amusing illustration : Having charged an officer of the government with dishonesty, he was required by Parliament, under a heavy penalty, publicly to retract the ac cusation in the House of Commons. At the appointed time, he appeared with a written recantation, which he read aloud as follows: " I said he was dishonest, it is true; and I am sorry for it." This was satisfactory; but what was the surprise of Parliament following day to see the retraction printed in the papers thus: " I said he was dishonest; is true, and I am sorry for it." By a simple transposition of the comma and semi colon, the ingenious slanderer repre sented himself to the country, not on ly as having made no recantation, but even as having reiterated the charge in the very face of Parliament. The Goldea Age says: We understand that old Mr. Bennett, the founder of the New York Herald, has so greatly failed in health and strength that he now takes almost no interest in: anything, and is gliding gently into helplessness and second childhood. For months past, we have noticed an unusual reticence concern ing him by the press at large. He has ceased to be sneered at and abused. His name still stands at the head of the great newspaper which he called into life and power, but his contem poraries, who for many years gave him a daily blow, now refrain from kicking the sick lion. Old age and weakness thus come not unattended with compensation after all. The Indian who lassoed the loco motive and was thereby transported to the happy hunting grounds, has lately had a rival in a brother red man, who, after a too free indulgence in "fire-water," built his wigwam on the railroad near St. Paul, Minnesota, but had most disastrous luck in at tempting to stop a freight train. The Levees. The importance .of an organized levee system, for protection against floods in the Mississippi Valley, is gradually forcing itself upon the at tention of the American people. With out security against overflow, it is clear that the rich bottom lands of the delta cannot be cultivated with any thing like confidence. While slavery existed, the riparian proprietors were required to keep the levees in order, under the supervision of local parishi juries; but the efficiency of the work depended largely on the energy and foresight of the proprietors themselves, and was never pursued under a com prehensive system and with an intel ligent view to general results. The authorities in one parish might be provident and careful, and vet fail to ensure protection if those of an adjoin ing parish were not similarly consti tuted. But as the matter now stands, in the tier of States of which the Mis sissippi is either a boundry or an arte ry, neither the State nor the parochial authorities, and much less, the ripa rain proprietors, find themselves pos sessed of the means requisite for the accomplishment of so great a work. The power to devise and execute a comprehensive plan, by which State lines are crossed and State interests subordinated to the larger interests of the wlhole people of the Union, can only be found in the general govern ment. But the work, to engage the direct attention of the general govern ment, should be of national impor tance; and that it is, will scarcely be denied when the actual and prospec tive products of the low lands along the Father of Waters are taken into consideration. Cotton, sugar and rice play too important a part in our com mercial tables and domestic and foreign exchanges to be dwarfed even by the most intense of sectional prejudices. In the grand possibilities suggested by their enlarged production, the issues are national in their widest senk, for on them our commercial supremacy as a people hinges. These views were rec og ized by the National Board of Trade, which recently held a session at St. Louis, and are likely at length to find expression in some practical form through our National Legislature at Washington. Already one of our Representatives in Congress, Gen. Sypher, to wit, has introduced a bill providing for a combined railway and levee system, embracing the States of Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, in its general scope, and naming as corporators some of our most promin ent citizens. In the bill, as proposed, a grant of $16,000 per mile is to be made, for the construction of this levee railway, which is to furnish, at once, security against overflow and an ever ready. means of transportation to those who' live behind it. This may not be the form in which national aid will be eventually secured, but it is evident that the people of the whole country are beginning to study the subject, and are casting about for some satisfactory method of securing a de sideratum so devoutly to be wished. N. O. Thimes. A Threat. [From the New Orleans Republican.] Messrs. Packard, Casey, Carter & Co., did not spend much idle time at the tomb of the late Lieutenant Gov ernor, nor did they allow his political succession to remain unopened any longer than they could make applica tion to be put in possession of its effects. They gave but little time to lamentation, and less to retirement, having even cast lots for his robes of State as the dead officer lay unburied. While the Republican party, which honored Mr. D)unn, and which laments his loss, was quietly preparing to fill his vacant place, these factionists were soiling the crape which they wore by trading with the men who reconciled to the deceased for favors to themselves. If this is doubted, look at the coalition which occurred between the Democrats, who refused to attend the funeral, and the faction ists who pretended to be the chief mourners at the tomb. And as they lost no time, so they lost no argument in attempting to succeed with their effort to betray the Republican party. Every stone that lay in the way was turned over to discover the secret by which Senator Pinchback could be defeated; every corner was rounded close, and every lot crossed direct to bring the faction ists nearer to the object of their desires. Senators were bored with reasons, some of which were stupid, and some of which were base, and others of which were false, why they should defeat the acknowledged choice of the Republican members. When the factionists pretended that the Governor was not in earnest in his Republicanism, they committed a folly that they themselves did not believe; when they accused him of a design to sell out to the Democrats, they basely perpetrated a slander against another which properly be longed to themselves; and when they approached Senators with threats of interference from Washington, they committed themselves to falsehoods, as we believe, which the proper authorities will denounce and deny. It is now for the Republican party to pass judgement upon the case as it stands. Governor Warmoth stood fast by the party, while those who had accused him of a design to join the Democrats are themselves discov ered voting with the Democrats. He has been accused of intending to desert the negroes, and yet, while he stands fast in support of a colored man, the presuming and ready prom ising friends of the negroes vote for a white man. He thus at one blow destroys two slanders directed at his honesty of purpose, and assists in convicting his assailants of being guilty of the very acts which they had charged him with the design to perpetrate. And, not satisfied with defaming a Republican Governor and spreading division and distrust in the Republican party, they still further demonstrate their wickedness by using the name of the President in a way that, wecannot suppose for an instant, they are justified in doing. Marshal Packard certainly never had the authorization of General Grant to threaten the State with martial law, in order to carry a point in the Legis lature of the State. And yet Mr. Packard has abused the name of the President in this very fashion, threat ening Louisiana with a military gov ernment in the event she does not observe the dictates of the Custom house ring. This is what Mr. Packard has deliberately suggested in the name of President Grant. He used this threat, too, at a time when it was calculated to serve a political purpose. It ivas delivered deliberately, in order to affect a Senator's vote. The design was to shape the action of the State Senate in its highest capacity. Mr. Packard has put himself in the ath tude of the man who attempts to in timidate the State. He says to Sena tor Butler, "Do so, or you will be put under martial law." He says to a Senator that his duty is to vote as President Grant desires, and not as he himself would elect to vote. It is the government of one man that Mr. Packard desires to establish. We are to have Senators and pay for them, but they are only to be the mouth-pieces of the President. Mar tial law will supervene if they act as Senators, and not as echoes. The letter of Senator Butler, which we print below, tells this story and declares all this insignificant informa tion. We do not believe that Mr. Packard spoke by authority of the President; but that he spoke as he is represented to have done we firmly believe, because the tenor of the Custom-house organ is to the same effect in its article announcing the appointment of General Emory to the command of this district. The threat is deliberately renewed therein that military law is contemplated by Car ter, Casey, Packard & Co., since they are too weak to win their game in any other way. 

LETTER OF SENATOR BUTLER. NEw ORLEAss, December 8, 1871. I consider it a duty to make public the following facts, in order that President Grant may know how he is misrepresented, if he be so, and that the people of the United States, if he be not misrepresented, may learn to what desperate extremes the Presi dent has determined to go to extend and perpetuate his power. Just before the election for Lieu tenant Governor of Louisiana, vice Hon. 0. J. Dunn, deceased, the Uni ted States Marshal for this State, Hon. S. B. Packard, sought me and stated that I was ruining my future prospects by not joining his side, to wit: the Republican minority and Democratic coalition; that it was of no great consequence whether War moth Republicans elected the Lieu tenant Governor or not, or even if Warmoth succeeded in obtaining re-election in 1872, for in that event they had the guarantee of President Grant that he would at once declare martial law, and give his political friends all the office.. He urged me, for these reasons, to vote for his can didate, and added that General Reyn olds would be in military command here, and that everything would be all right with hinm. E. 

BUTLER, Senator Fifth Senatorial District. .. .. . I,_M .1. - ' COURT ANECDOTES.-The tedious session of the Supreme Court at Pitts field, was relieved by an incident, one day last week, that drew a little snmile. A leading member of the bar, rather noted for his strategy of con fusing witnesses by working them into a passion, had under cross-exam ination a woman who seemed an apt subject for his favorite tactics; having wound her up to the desired pitch, he inquired, "Madam, are you now living with your first or second hus band ?" "That's none of yonr busi ness!" sharp and short. With an air of offended dignity the attorney turned to Chief Justice Brigham, who remarked, with a smile, " I think the witness is about right in that, is she not?" Which reminds the older members of the bar of a similar mis adventure that a still more distin guished member of the Berkshire bar once met with at the hands of Justice Shaw. "Where did you get the money with which you made the pur chase spoken of t" asked the "learn ed brother" of a witness under the tortures of cross-examination. " None of your (gentle expletive) business!" thundered the victim. " Now, may it please you, are counsel to be insulted in this manner T" appealed the law yer. "Witness," said the Chief Jus tice, compassionately, " do you wish to change your last answer ?" "No, sir, I don't." " Well, I wouldn't if I were in your place." And the chuckle that shook the bench was audibiy echoed. The main feature of the Congres sional programme for the Winter is the admission of Colorado, Utah and New Mexico as States. The Famine in Persia. The following account of the famine in Persia is taken from a statement made at a public meeting recently held in London, to raise money for the relief of the sufferers: " The lamentable famine now raging in Persia, and threatening to carry off hundreds of thomlsands of the scanty population of that extensive kingdom, has been caused by the unparalleled drought which has pre vailed throughout the country during the last three years. " In an area far exceeding that of Great Britain and France together, no river of any importance exists, and the quantity of rain in the spring and summer is insignificant. In ordinary years, however, the fall of snow between November and March is con siderable. It thickly covers the huge nmountain ranges which intersect Per sia, and as it melts in the spring and summer it fills the water-courses and small canals from which the peasants irrigate their crops. The soil in the valley is naturally fertile, and a little labor insures a large har vest if only the winter snowfall has been abundant. This, unhappily, has for the last two or three years been singularly wanting; the springs, water-courses and rivulets have been completely dried up, the corn sown over and over again, has been blasted, the supplies in the country have been exhausted, and famine, without dis ease in its train, is rapidly doing its deadly work. " The whole population of Persia has recently been estimated at 4,000, 000, a large proportion of whom are Felyauts, wandering tribes who cor respond to the Bedaween of Arabia Mesopotamniar. Felyauts principally inhabit the southern and eastern part of the empire, where the drought has been most severe. Their means of subsistence depend mainly on their flocks and herds, which have now, in some places, altogether perished, owing to the total want of grass on the mountain slopes and in the val leys. The most pitiful destitution and the most appalling mortality are the results. The towns have suffered scarcely less. At Bushire, where relief is most easily afforded, and where much has been done under the auspices of the British Minister, deaths by starvation are of daily occurrence. It is reported that the population of Kazeroon lately esti mated at ten thousand, has fallen during these days of visitation to one fifth that number; that in round numbers some four thousand have died of famine since this time last year, and a like number have fled the place. A similar condition of affairs exists at Shiraz, Kooniesher and more or less all over the large provinces of Kirman and Khorassan, while even in the less afflicted northerni districts most lamentable distress prevails. It is reported that in the city of Ispahan alone, no less than twelve thousand people have died of want, and more than double that number in the province. No material improvement can be looked for until next spring.' I 9 0 - - o.. . A REMINISCENCE OF BEECHER. The Indianopolis Eveining Journalfur nishes the following: Speaking of ministerial knowledge of forbidden things, reminds us of Henry Ward Beecher. The unregen erate hearers of Henry Ward have of ten been surprised at his knowledge of certain things about which a preacher is supposed to be blissfully ignorant. Mr. Beecher always makes it a point to familiarize himself with subjects which he is called upon to preach at. An old citizen informs us that during his residence in this city Mr. Beecher was impelled to preach a sermon against gambling, and in or der thathe might speak" by the card," he wanted to learn something of short cards, banking games, etc. Now, Henry Ward's early education had been neglected in this particular, bat he procured an introduction to Col. Alvord, the present Chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee. In his young days Col. Alvord had done a little in the way of straight po ker (draw is a later invention of the enemy), seven-up, euchre, brag, forty five, and other games of chance. No amateur sportsman had a better con ception ot the value of three jacks than Col. Alvord, or played a closer game of seven-up. He could also hold the tiger as near level as any other man living. Col. Alvord readily con sented to enlighten Mr. Beecher, and the two had frequent meetings in the back room of the Branch Bank, where the preacher became theoretically pro ficient in all the arts and tricks of cards. Having fully informed himself, he preached a powerful sermon, which created considerable' excitement at the time, and gave rise to an unjust suspicion that Brother Beecher had, at sore period of his life, known how it was himself, Judge Cush once had a dog case, in which the ownership of the canine was in dispute. The evidence was conflicting, and the Judge became confused. "Stop!" said he, " stop right there! We'll settle the matter very shortly. You, Mr. Plaintiff, go over into the far corner out there. You, Mr. Defendant, come into this corner up here. Now both of you whistle, and, Mr. Clerk, let the dog loose." So said, so done; but the dog sprang between the legs of the bystandera and "scooted" out of the door,
