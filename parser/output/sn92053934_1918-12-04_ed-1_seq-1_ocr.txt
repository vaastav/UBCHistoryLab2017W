PRESS LAUDS WILSON Finerable (oinment On Speech to Con-rrcss Miide By British and French Papers. Taris, Dec. 4. The Paris news papers print the principal passages of President Wilson's message to congress and special writers com ment favorably. Gustave Herve in La Vietoire writes : "One passage of the message in terests us especially. It is that in which President Wilson announces his intention of asking congress to make a special effort to help the economic restoration of France and Belgium. It is not without deep gratitude that France and Belgium will learn of this fresh demonstra tion of active and broiherlv sym pathy on the part of the American people." London. Dec. 4.--President Wil son's address to the American congress was extensively com mented upon by this morning's newspapers here. The .Morning Post, while paying tribute to the president and Amer ican cooperation, inMsts upon the importance 'if the exact relation of the 14 points to the peace settle ment being understod. The news paper thinks the points were ac epted t(,o hastily hv the allied governments. It relies, however, upon the president's definition of them as an o.itline of the basis of peace and regards them as "a ser victable instrument with which to begin the work of securing peace " Everything depends upon their interpretation and application. 1

English King Has 'Some' Opinion of Ex-Kaiser Cousin London, Nov. 28. (Corespond cnee of the Associated Press.) What does King George really think of his cousin, William Hohen zollern, former German emperor? That is a question that has been often asked but has never received anything approaching an authori tative answer. According to a writer in the Daily News, which is usually very careful as to the trustworthiness of what it prints. King George regards him as "the greatest criminal in the world to day." The writer says that he was talk ing a few days ago with a well known stateman who has had many opportunities during the war and especially lately, of hearing the king express his views of the kaiser and he thus summarizes what the "well known statesman" told him: "My informant says that the king's feelings and expressions are so strong that they could hardly he reproduced verbatim but that the j substance of them Is that the kaiser Is the greatest criminal in the! world today; that he is directly re- ! sponsible for tho outrages on the I Belgian and French civil popula- ; tions; for the bombing and air; rai'ls on the innocent inhabitants' of unfortified towns; for the tor- perilling of passenger and hospital j ships and the sinking of survivors 1 in their life boats; for the first use of poisoned gas. the poisoning of wells, the destruction of works of art; destruction of historic build ings of beautiful towns, and the machinery of industrial life and po- tention reconstruction, that he has j not only permitted these things to j proceed, but was In many rases a; personal assenter to and director j of them and thai for such a man no' retributive penalty, however severe,! would be undeserved.' , RAM.

In the course of his remarks Ken- ator Kellogg expressed regret at what he characterized as the lark of disposition of President Wilson to deal more frankly with the people and the senate regarding his views on problems coming before the peace conference. Pointing out that a league of na tions to stop all wars had been a "favorite theme for discussion by benevolent publicists and states men for two thousand years," Sen ator Kellogg said that i's failure to date need not be discouraging and that public sentiment had advanc ed until an international alliance for maintenance of peace may now be considered feasible. "I believe the time has come." he said, "to try to establish a league to prevent war and to enforce peace, which may not be entirely preventative, but backed by a world public sentiment, will have a tre mendous influence toward main taining justice and equitable rela tions between nations and prevent ing the sorrows of war."
