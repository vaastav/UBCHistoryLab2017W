TUESDAY EVENING, DEC. (1,1992. aIr. Hakeisox's kst message is, if Ji ?ssible, wor.se than Iiis first, and the par devoted to the tariff is even ridicu? lous, and reads more like an emanation fromla disappointed boy than from the Ciicf of a nation of nearly seventy million |.pie. He still insists that the high tariff is right, aud that to i! ail the prosperity of the country is due, and recommends that the republican Senate do nothing to change it. leaving that work for the democratic Congress. He reasserts the exploded idea that tariff increases wages, and that without it, America can not compete with for? eign nations, though he must know that American inuiacturers can and do compete with foreign nations in most of the markets of the world, and sell their goods in them at cheaper rates than they sell them at home. He compli? ments all the members^of his cabinet upon the alleged wise ami efficient mat', agement oftheir respective departments, and recommends increased ship subsi? dies. He-also recommends that the District of Columbia commissioners be given discretionary power for restrain? ing the liquor traffic in Washington, mid advises enlarged appropriations, for the civil service commission, whose re? commendations lie litis persistently scouted. He is loud in his praises of pensions for those who put dow n the "rebellion," and reiterates his trite ar? guments in favor of a free.vote and a fair count, and against the measures which some of the southern States have been forced to adopt for restricting suf? frage in order to preserve themselves from negro rule. Altogether the coun? try can well afford to be thankful that the man who wrote the message will never write another one. If the present high rate at which pensions are being increased be kept up much longer, the deficit in the Treas? ury, which has already become a coudi . tion, and not ti theory, will speedily de? velop into national bankruptcy, in spite of lite immense revenue thai is derived from tiie tariff tax on the necessaries of life of seventy million people. It i< es? timated by conservative men that the expenditures on pension account during the next fiscal year, including the defi? cit of the one already provided for. will exceed the enormous amount of two hundred million dollars. Such tin im? mense sum,twenty-eight years titter tlie close of the war. is grotesquely absurd. It cannot hi- that the claims of all of those among whom it is distributed are just or even legal, and a search should be made tit once for those that tire fraudulent, so that the payment thereof may be stopped. THE annual report of the commis? sioner of internal revenue proves what has long been known, that the per cap? ita consumption of strong liquors in this country is very much less than it used tolio. This, of course, is due to the in crensed consumption of beer and light home-made wines. Both the sobriety and the health of the people have been increased by tin- change, as has been the effect of tin- same cause in other countries. As people will drink alco? holic beverages; have done so from the I commencement of the world, and will do so until the end thereof, it is infinite? ly Letter for them and their families, and tho country, that their drinks should be mild and not strong, and that indulgence in them should be en? couraged rather than hindered by vain attempts at prohibition. The Gazette mentioned yesterday the fad thai of all the votes cast in Mississippi last mouth. Mr. Harrison only received fourteen hundred. Tin report of the official vote of Florida has now been received. It shows that in that State Mr. Harrison did not get a single vote ami that there was no re? publican ticket in the field. But, all the same, the republicans still assert that theirs is the great national party of the country. The republican party was born a sectional party and will die om\if it did not do so last mouth. Bills and resolutions have already Commenced to llood Congress, and will doubtless continue uninterruptedly un? til the end ot the session. They afford those who introduce them an easy op? portunity for having their names ap? pear in the newspapers, but will have no other practical effect than the cost of printing them. The people of the country will be satisfied if all the regu? lar appropriation bills shall be passed at this session, aud those at till familiar ?with congressional proceedings don't expect any more. The coal raroxs have determined to advance the price of coal still fart her about the middle of the current month. It is observed, however, that they have not determined to make a correspond? ing advance iu the wages of their miners. The removal of the tariff tax of seventy-five cents a ton on soft coal would tend to increase tho consumption of that sort of coal, and therefore to les sen the demand for. and decrexse '.) e price of hard coal. Tin: Ni.w VpKK Sun, in reference i<? Ihelalk about giving 3Ir. Cleveland another term at the conclusion of the one that will commence next March, says it ??"nonsense." It would seem so indeed, but people are very uncer? tain, and politics arc more so. and then, too, there is nothing so likely to hap? pen as the unexpected. TOM 

WAMNGTON. [Correspondence of the Alexandria Gazette.] washington; Dec. C. Senator Daniel of Virginia is in favor of repealing the present silver law. if the fr. e silver bill be substituted for it. Senator Huuton is non-committal. Senator IIill was in his seat in the Senat'' to-day, looking even more chip? per than ho did last session. Among thestruiigcrs here to-day is Col. Tom.

One Cent Postage.?Postmaster General Wanamakcr in his annual re? port has the following to say ou the question of postage : Oik- ecu; letter postage to every place in tiie world is what the nations are coming to. The present letter rate pays actually doubles tlie cost, ami by this overpay serves as a protective rate to tiie De? partment to cover the underpay from doing an express business for periodicals and books and carrying advertising sheets at 1 cent per pound, that in point of fact are nothing more I than business circulars that load the mails j enormously. All such mail is not only car? ried at a loss of six cents a pound, but it inter? feres materially with the business of the ex? press and railway companies, which are prop? erly carriers of the heavy packages and freight. Something new to uike the place of fractional currency for the remittance of small sums is very desirable. He urges the issue of a money postal card of denominations of 10 cents. 25 cents. 50 cents, and$L, and of the f.?r:n of the present small card and exactly similar to the ordinary postal card on tho ad? dress side, and on the reverse side an order on the postmaster of the city addressed for a fixed sum. payable on tho signature of the payee named in the address.

The following is a synopsis President Harrison's message sent to Congress to? day : To the Senate and House of Representa? tives: [u submitting my annual message to Con?tess I have great satisfaction in being able to say that the general con? dition allectiug the commercial and in dustriul interests ofthe United States an- in ihe highest degree favorable. A comparison of the existing condition with those of the most favored period in the history <>f the country will. I be? lieve, show that so high a degree of prosperity ami so general a dillusion of the com torts of life were never before enjoyed by our people. it is not my purpose to renew here the argumeul in favor of a protective tariff. The result of the recent election tu list lie accepted as having introduced a new policy. We must assume that the present tariff, constructed upon the lines of protection is to be repealed and that there is to be substituted for it a turiiflaw constructed solely with refer? ence to revenue; that no duty is to be higher because the increase will keep open an American mill or keep up the w ages of an American workman, but that in every case such a rate of duty is to be imposed as will bring to the treasury of the United States the largest returns of revenue. The contest has not been between schedules, but between principles, and it would be of fensive to suggest that the prevailing party will not carry into legislation the principles advocated by it and the pledges given to the people. The tariff bills passed by the House of Represent? atives al the last session were, as I sup? pose?even in the opinion of their pro? moters?inadequate and justified only by the fact that the Senate and House of Representatives were not hi accord and that a general revision could not therefore l>e undertaken. I recommend that the whole subject of tarill' revision be left to the incoming Congress. It is matter of regret that this work must be delayed for at least three months; for the threat of great tarill' charges in? troduces so much uncertainty that tin amount, not easily estimated, of busi? ness inaction and of diminished produc? tion, will necessarily result; It maybe, indeed. I believe is, possible for the American manufacturer to compete successfully with his foreign rival in many branches of production without the defense of protective duties if the pay rolls are equalized : but the conflict tiiat stands between the producer and that result, and the distress of the working people when it is attained, are not pleasant to contemplate. Our relations with other nations are now uudisturbed by any serious controversy. The complicated and threatening differences with Germany and England relating to Sambaii ailhirs. with England in relation to the seal lishet ies in the Behring sea, and with Chili growing out of tho "Baltimore" ailhirs have been adjusted. I regret to say, however, that in many of the cont oveisies. notably those as to the lishet ies on the Atlantic, the sealing interests on the Pacific, and the canal tolls, our negotiations with Great Bri? tain have continuously been thwarted or retarded by unreasonable and un? friendly objections aud protests from Canada. Under reciprocal trade arrange? ments a free or favored admis? sion has been secured for an im? portant list of American products. Aided by the establishment of Ameri? can steamship lines, I do not doubt that we shall, within a short period se? cure fully one-third of the total trade of the countries of Central and South America. In 1SS? we bad only eight per cent, of this trade. Tlie mail contracts made with the lines sailing to Central and South American ports haw increased the fre? quency, shortened the time of the trips and sustained some lines that other? wise would almost certainly have been withdrawn. I earnestly urge a contin? uance of the policy inaugurated by this legislation and that the appropriations required to meet the obligations under the contracts be continued. Tln re is no disposition on the part of the people or government of the United Stater to interfere in the smallest de? gree with the political relations ofCan ada. It is lime for us, however, to con? sider whether, if the present state of tilings and trend of tilings is to ctn Unite. We should not hesitate to avail ourselves of our great natural trade ad? vantages. We should withdraw the support which is given to the railroads and steamship lines of Canada by a traffic that properly belongs to us, and no longer furnish the earnings which lighten the otherwise crushing weight of tin- enormous public substitutes that have been given to them. It gives me now great gratification to report that tho Chilian government in a most friendly and honorable spirit has ten? dered and paid us an indemnity to the families of the sailors of the Baltimore who were killed and injured in tho out? break in the city of Valparaiso, the sum ofS75,000. This has been accepted as a most gratifying evidence that the government of Chili rightly appreciates the disposition of this government to act in a spirit of the most absolute fair? ness and friendliness in our intercourse with that brave people. [ The friendly act of this government in expressing to the government of Ita? ly its reprobation ami abhorence of the lynching of Italian subjects in New Or? leans by the payment of$24,330.90, was accepted by the King of Italy with every manifestation of gracious appreci? ation, and the incident has been highly promotive of mutual respect and good will. In consequence of the action of the French government in proclaiming a protectorate over certain tribal districts of tho west coast of Africa, eastward of the San Pedro river, which has long been regarded as the southeastern boun? dary of Liberia, I have felt constrained to make protest against tiiis encroach? ment upon the territory of a republic which was founded by citizens of the United States, I repeat with great earnestness the recommendation which 1 may have made in several previous message* that < prompt an adequate support be given 1 to the American company engaged in the construction of the Nicaragua ship canal. It is impossible to overstate the value from every standpoint of this great enterprise. Iu the recommendation of the fcecre ! tary of the Treasury that the sinking j fund law be repealed I concur. The redemption of bonds since the passage j of thi) law to June 30. 1S02. has al? ready exceeded the requirements. The retirement of bonds lv. the future before maturity should be a twate; of conveni? ence, not of compulsion. 'We should not collect revenue for that puipoiC. but only use any casual surplus. Tiie public confidence in the purpose | ' and ability of the government to main-' tain the parity of all our money is?ues, | whether coin or paper, must remain un? shaken. The demand for gold Ln Eu? rope and the consequent calls upon us are in a considerable degree the result of the efforts of some of the European governments to increase their gold re? serves, and these etlbrts should be met by appropriate legislation on our part, j The conditions that have created this j irain of the Treasury gold are in an important degree political and not com? mercial. In view of the fact that u i general revision of our revenue laws in | the near future seems to be probable, it would be better that any changes should be a part of that revision rather than of a temporary nature. The fact that the monetary conference is now sitting and that no conclusion has yet been reached, I withhold any icom? mendation as to legislation upon this subject. It is too early to predict what results may be accomplished by the interna? tional monetary conference at Brussels. If any temporary check or delay inter? venes, I believe that very soon com? mercial conditions wiil compel the now reluctant governments to unite with us in the movement to secure the enlarge? ment of the volume of coined money needed for the transaction of the busi? ness of t lie world. The Report of the Secretary of War brings again to the attention of Con gress some important suggestions as to the reorganization of the infantry and artillery arms of the service. Our army is small, but its organization should all the more be put upon the most ap? proved modern ba.-is. I have before expressed my concur? rence in the recommendation of the At? torney-General that degrees of murder should bo recognized in the Federal statutes as they are, I believe, in all tin States. The recognition of them would euable the courts to exercise some dis? cretion in apportioning punishment, und would greatly relieve the execution I of what is coming to be a very heavy j lmrdeu. The aggregate of claims pending j against the government in the Court of j Claims for the taking of or injury to the property of persons claiming to be loyal during the war, the Indian depra dation claims and the French spoliation claims is indeed startling. The agents of the government arc sent into the tield to rummage for what evidence they can lind. This difficulty is precautiously great where the fact to be established is the disloyalty of the claimant during the war. Congress should supply thf? Department of Jus? tice witli appropriations sufficiently liberal lo secure the best legal talent in the defense of these claims. The report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits great progress in the construc? tion of our new navy. It is believed as the result of new processes in the con? struction of armor plate our late ships will be clothed with defensive plates of higher resisting power than an- found on any war vessels afloat. The whole? some influence for pence and the in? creased sense of security which our citi? zens domiciled in other lands feel when these magnificent ships, under the American (lag appear, is already most greatfully apparent. The report of the commission? er of persions will attract great attention. 'I he passage of what is known as the disability hill has. as was foreseen, very largely increased the annual disbursement lo the disabled veterans of the civil war. [ adhere to the views expressed in previous mes? sages that the care of the disabled sol? diers of the war of the rebellion is a matter of national concern and duty. I cannot believe that this process has yet reached a point witli our people that would sustain the policy of remitting the care of these disabled veterans to the inadequate agencies provided by .'o c d law. In my last annual message I calh .1 attention to the fact that some legisla? tive action was necessary in order to protect the interest of the government in its relations with the Union Pacific Railway. I recommended in my last annual message that a commission be appointed to deal with this question, and I renew that recommendation, ami suggest that the commission be given full power. The report of the Secretary of Agri? culture contains many suggestions for I the enlarged usefulness of this import? ant department. In the successful ef? fort to break down tile restrictions to the free introduction of our meat pro-; duets in the countries of Europe the secretary has been untiring. Quarantine regulations should be uniform at all our ports. Under tiie constitution they are plainly within the exclusive federal jurisdiction when and so far as Congress shall legislate. In my opinion the whole subject should be taken into national control and ad? equate power given to the executive to protect our people against plague invasions. On the 1st of September last I approved regulations establishing a twenty-day quarantine for all vessels bringing immigrants from foreign ports. This order will be continued in force. Some loss and suffering have resulted to passengers, but a due care for the homes of our people justifies in such cases the utmost precaution, There is danger that with the coming of spring cholera will again appear, and a liberal appropriation should be made at this session to enable our quarantine and port officers to exclude the deadly plague. We are peculiarly subject in our great ports to the spread of infectious diseases by reason of the fact that unre? stricted immigration brings to us out of European cities, a large number of per? sons whose surroundings make them the easy victims of the plague. This | leads me to renew the suggestion that admission to our country and to the high privileges of its citizenship should be more restricted and more careful. We have, I think, a right, and owe a duty to our own people, and especially to our working people, cot only to keep out the vicious, the ignorant, the civil disturber, the pauper and the contract laborer, but to cheek the too great llow of immigration now coming by further limitations. The District of Columbia is left, by a decision of the Supreme Court of the District, without any law regulating the liquor traffic. It is of urgent im? portance therefore that Congress should supply, either by direct enactment or by conferring discretionary powers upon the commissioners, proper limita? tions and restraints upou the liquor traffic in the Districi. In renewing the recommendations which I have made in three preceding annual messages that Congress should legislate for the protection of railroad employees against the dangers incident to the old and inadequate methods of braking and coupling which are still in use upor; freight trains, I do so with the hope that this Congress may take action upon the subject, I have, in each ofiny annual me3 sases, caPed attention to the evils nnd dangers connected with our elec? tion methods and practices us they are related to the choice of offi? cers of the national government, in my last anneal incs.-a;o i endeavored tu invoke serious attention to the evils of unl'nir apportionments fur Congress. It is time that mutual charges of unfairness und fraud l>e tweeu the two great parties should cease and that I he sincerity of those who profess a desiie for pure and honest elections should he brought to the test of their wiUiuguess to fre ? our legislation and election methods from cor? ruption that tends to impart the public cunii dence. The necessity for an inquiry and for legislation by Congress upon this subject is emphasized by tbd fact that the tendeucy of the legislation in some States in recent years has. in some important particulars, been away from and not toward free and fair elections and equal apportionments. The frequent lynching of-colorcd people sc cused of crime is without the excuse which has sometimes been urged by mubs for a fail? ure to pursue the appointed methods for the ' punishment of crime, that the accused have an undue influence over courts and juries. Such nets are a reproach to the community where they occur, and so far os they can bo made the subject of jurisdiction the strongest repres? sive legislation is demanded. A public senti? ment that will sustain the officers of the law t in resisting mobs and in protecting accused i persons in their custody should be promoted by every possible means. This exhibit of tiie work of the executive departments is submitted to Congress and to the public in the hope that there will be found hi it a due sense of responsibility and an earn? est iimpose to maintain the national honor and to promote the happiness and prosperity of allourpcop'e. 15 v. n.i a mi .v iiaij hi so n*.
