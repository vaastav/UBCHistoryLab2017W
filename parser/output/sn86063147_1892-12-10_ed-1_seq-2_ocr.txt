THE REGISTER. t.amab, - - COLORADO Interesting people aro the rarest in the world. Beople of intelligence, morality, goodness—all manner of admirable qualities—abound. but those who have the magnetic spar* of interest and charm be counted on the fingers of one hand. A well-known agricultural writer estimates that good roads would save the farmers of toe l uited Suites SSOO. 000. 000 per year in the cost of getting their produce to market, or nearly $8 to each inhabitant of the country, which is a fairer estimate than to suppose the whole sum will be divided among the farmers nlono. Mmf. Adam, the Paris editress, says that there is an emancipation of the young women of France, caused by their intercourse with English and American visitors. They aro no longer chaperoned on evory occasioa their manners and customs have undergone great changes, and they are Angli cized and Amoricanlzed to a great extent The old saying that a man who is h s own lawyer has a fool for a client may boa little too sweeping. NN o would not state the truth which it contains in quite so harsh a form. But is is ontirely within the bounds to say that the claimant who tries to look after his own claim instead of having it prosecuted by a competent attorney does not understand his owu interesta A resident of (hicago being dis charged by his employer, was advised at the samo timo to drown himself. Ho promptly did this, his habit of obedience having been too firmly fixed to be swervod by a mere dis charge. Now the widow thus created sues the ex-employer for SSO. 000. for being the promulgator of fatal advice. This set of facts will afford justice an opportunity to U6e her finest scales. The growth Ot ipternational arbi tration has hot been as rapid a3 tho friends q[ peace were at one time lyd lo hope. In spite of arguments and practical examples tho l nited States and Great Britain are almo-t alone in their ndhosion to the princi ple. The other nations still hold to the stern and tested policy of getting what they can by Individual bargain ing. and lighting wliou they cannot agree. The state of luaho is acquiring a reputation very rapidly. W ithin a few weeks it has yielded up from Its interior an opal field, a giant glacier, a forest of petrified redwoods and bones of extinct races of man and beast. Meanwhile a party of prospect has returned after three years in its remote fastnesses laden to the point of exhaustion with gold dust. A lit tle further exploration it is hoped, will disclose a race of plgmiea the missing link and a lake of milk em banked with honey. Tin. advantages of arbitration are easy to be understood, 'lo say nothing of avoiding tho slaughter of good productive citizens, the finan cial advantages aro almost wholly on the side of peace. Napoleon was a master hand at robbery and believed fully in the maxim of living off tho enemy, yet in spite of all the money raised by taxation in France and the countries appropriated by Franco the debt had increased from 714.000,000 francs to 1.272.000.000 francs at the end of the fifteen years of Napoleon’s government. Mich wisdom has been expended over the reported achievement of Hannibal in making his way over tho Alps by means of vinegar. It now appears that the word vinegar was wrong, the name properly at tho present day applying to a sharp kind of pickaxe that cuts something as metaphorically very sharp vinegur is sometimes said to do. But from this ancient mistake in a word has grown a common modern error. That is tho idea that vinegar, heated or other wise. will destroy rocks better than water will da If the rock be partly composed of lima the vinegar might combine with the lime, and so dis solve it. But when a fire is mode on a rock to heat it. vinegar is no better than water to turn or break it.
