Abstract of the Reports of Departments. We subjoin an abstract ot the reports of the several State Departments, which accompany the President’s message, as far as received: the secretary of war’s report. Secretary Stanton rapidly re\*iews the more important military operations of the year, referring especially to the victories of Stone River, Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Port Hud son, the operations in Tennessee, the recent splendid successes of Gen. Grant before Chat tanooga, the opening of the Mississippi and territorial division of the Rebel Confederacy, the campaign of Gen. Burnside in East Ten nessee and his gallant defense of Knoxville, the occupation of the Avestern frontier of Texas, and the probable restoration of the State The armies in Virginia arc relatively in about the same position as last year, and -heir campaigns have resulted in nearly equal losses. But the general success of the year is so great that the Department is able to reduce its estimates for the ensuing vear more than $200,000,000. The present suspension of the exchange of prisoners is due to the bad faith of the rebels in putting the paroled Vicksburg and Port Hudson prisoners into the field before they were exchanged, and to the refusal to recog nize colored troops as prisoners of war. The rebels are attempting by barbarous treatment of our prisoners to compel the Government to exchange 40,000 for 13,000, and to Icuai* our colored troops to rebel mercy. If neces sary for the protection of our soldiers, strict retaliation in the treatment of prisoners will be resorted to. The enrollment act has been enforced in Avelve States, producing 50,000 soldiers, and $10,000,000, The act is imperfect, but can be made an efficient means for recruiting the National forces. No decisive opinion is ex pressed on the S3OO commutation clause. A large proportion of veterans Avill re-enlist, and the required forces Avill iu a great meas ure he raised by volunteering. An immediate appropriation for bounties should he made. The invalid corps, oigauized to give honor able employment to partially disabled officers and soldiers, numbers over 20,000, and is in all respects a success. Colored troops have been diligently enlist ed ; 50,000 are now in service, and their numbers rapidly increase. Their courage and capacity have been amply proved at Mil liken’s Bend, Bort Hudson and Fort Wagner ; and more recently negro cavalry, in the Ya zoo Valley, routed a superior force of rebels. These troops have been allowed no bounty, and arc paid but ten dollars a month—a dis tinction Avhich is unequal ami unjust, and to remove which an amendment of the law is recommended. The colored women and chil dren, and the aged and infirm, should be pro vided for by Government. Some matters in the Adjutant General’s office arc briefly touched. A system of exact accountability, in leave of absence eases, has been established. The ordnance expenses for the year have been $12,313,630.21. During the same period 1,577 cannon, 1,082,841 mus kets and rifles, 282,38*9 carbines and pistols, 1,295,(100 cannon shot and shell, 48,719,862 pounds of lead and bullets, 1,-135,046 artillery cartridges, 259,022,216 cartridges for small arms, and other munitions in proportion have been purchased. A tabular abstract is given. The domestic manufacture of arms and mu nitions has greatly increased and improved. So of the materials used ; wrought iron, for instance, being uoav made in America supe rior to that imported. Two millions of dol lars should be appro} riated for supplying the State militias with a ins. Seal oard and bor der fortifications luia’C been put during the year in a much stronger defensive condition. Vacancies from the rebel States in tin* Mili tary Academy at West Point have been sup plied from the loyal States. A report con cerning the Academy is annexed. The sur veys of the Northern and Xortlnvcstcrn Lakes have been actively continued, and a report is expected on the defensive Avorks required to guard the lake shores. For details of operations in the Quartor master-Genernl’s Department, reference is made to his report. A cavalry Bureau for the supply of horses has been established.— The Commissary-General's office has kept the army at all points supplied with abundance of wholesome food, and has also furnished subsistence to prisoners, contrabands in great numbers, and to suffering- Unionists in rebel States. The armies have been paid, Avith few exceptions, to Oct. 31, of the present year, the latest period allowed In law. There an* 182 general hospitals, containing 84,472 beds. The number of patients, June So, in the general hospitals was 9,1 percent., and in the field 1.4 per cent., of the whole strength of the army, ot whom 11 percent, are wound ed and 2.5 per cent. sick. By the system of inspectors the medical and hospital service has been greatly improved. The health of the troops has been good, and their mortality less than last year. The Signal Corps is dif ferently valued by different Generals, but its continuance is recommended with proper re strictions. Tho Military Telegraph has been of inestimable value. On the 12th of July, 1862, there Avere 3,571 miles of land and sub marine lines, and during the year 1,755 miles Avere constructed, making a total of 5,326 miles iu operation. It is estimated that 1,200,000 telegrams have been sent Avithin the year, varying in length from ten to a thousand Avords. Commissioners under act of Congress have reported that $800,612 are due to officers and men actually employed in the Western De partment, or Department of Missouri, for pay, bounty, and pensions. An appropriation to that amount is recommended. Other large classes of claims require Congressional legis lation for their adjustment and payment. The Judge-Advocate-General and Ids assistants have been diligent and successful iu the de tection and prevention of military crimes and frauds. The office demands an enlargement of its facilities. During fourteen months 17,637 military trials were rcvicAvcd, and 2,490 reports issued. Credit is given by the Secretary to the Chiefs of Bureau in the War Department for their efficiency, and the re port concludes Avitli the hope that another year will see the rebellion completely over thrown. 1 the navy department. The Secretary of the Navy opens Ids re port Avith a rcvicAv of the blockade during the past year—a blockade unparalleled in point of extent, for it covers, according to an ac curate table of measurement prepared at the Coast Survey Office, a distance of 3,549 statute miles, Avith 189 harbor or river open ings, or indentations. The blockade is be coming more effective and complete. Pro gress has been made in repelling the Rebels from the coast and circumscribing their limits. Ihe North Atlantic Squadron has so effi ciently penetrated, watched and guarded the rivers of Virginia, the sounds of North Caro lina and the entire coast, as to out off all in tercourse Avith the rebels, Avith the single ex ception of the port of Wilmington, to close which has been difficult from its two inlets, thirty miles apart, Hanked by extensive bat teries. Some fast steamers have, under the cover of darkness, succeeded in eluding cap ture, but most even of that description of vessels have fallen into our hands or been driven on shore. The chief mart of the blockade-runners, Charleston, has been in the course of the year, entirely closed to them. A first attempt made by Rear-Admiral Dupont on the 7th of April, proved unsuccessful; but it is believed that since July, when Rear-Admiral Dahlgren took command of the fleet, and soon after captured Morris Island,no vessels lyve eluded the vigilance of our fleet or effected commu nication with the rebels on that coast. Not a single blockade-runner has reached Charles ton for five months. Thus, as a commercial mart. Charleston no longer exists; as a stra tegic point it is of little consequence. With in the limits of this squadron, the most extra ordinary naval conflict during the year oecur rod the battle between the a vessel of the monitor class, and the formida ble armed rebel steamer Atlanta. It was a test both of this new class of vessels and of the mcav 15-inch ordnance. The remarka ble result, the capture of the formidable re bel craft after only fifteen minutes’ resist ance, made a sensation throughout the civil ized Avorld, and appears to have extinguished the last aopes of the rebels to withstand our naval power by naval means. The Eastern Gulf Squadron has almost en tirely annihilated the illicit trade in it; de partment, which, on account of the nearness of Florida to Cuba and Nassau, presents so many available ports for eluding the block ade. More than one hundred craft have been captured or destroyed. The Western Gulf and the Mississippi Squadron; assisted in some of the greatest victories obtained for our cause during the year—the former aiding* in reducing Port Hudson, and the latter in reducing Vicksburg. Together they thus opened the naA'igation of the Mississippi—one of the heaA iest blows in flicted upon the rebels since the beginning of the Avar. Only one point of importance for successfully eluding the blockade was still in the posssession of the rebels—the mouth of the Rio Grande ; and this has now also been closed by the successful expedition of Gen. Banks. The increase of the naval force during the past year has again been very considerable. At the commencement of the Administration it consisted of 70 vessels, and of these only 42 were in commission. In December, 1862, the number of our vessels Avas 427 ; during the current year it has increased to 588. The Secretary calls attention to the highly important improvements in naA*al warfare to Avhich our war has led, and which have as tounded the entire civilized world—the in troduction into naval service of iron shield ing and of ordnance of a caliber, reach and power heretofore regarded as impossible. He urges upon the consideration of Congress the adoption of further measures for creating a poAverful navy. The establishment of anew Navy Yard on a large scale, he regards as an indispensable necessity, as om present facili ties for manufacturing and repairing steam machinery are entirely insufficient. Sugges tions are made as to the establishment of a Naval Depot on the Mississippi, the educa tion of engineers, the Naval Academy, the enlistment of seamen and other important subjects. The number of vessels captured by the squadrons and reported to the Department on the Ist of November is 1,045, classified as follows: Schooners, 547; steamers, 179; sloops, 131; brigs. 30: barks. 26: ships. 15: yachts and small boats, 117. This is exclusive of a large number destroyed on the Mississippi and other rivers, and on the coast. Iu the discharge of his arduous duties, Mr. Welles has “ has been constantly cheered and sustained by the assured conviction that the Navy of the United States has achieved a great and new historical renoAvn ; that it has expanded and is expanding in a measure com mensurate Avitli the exigencies of the country and of the times; that it has done and is doing heroic service in a groat and sacred cause, and that its force is wielded by a body of officers and men avlio loum established the highest claim to tho gratitude of the country.” great guns in the nany. The Report of the Ordnance Bureau gi\*es an interesting vicAV of tho enforced progress of work in that important branch of service. The naval ordnance at the beginning of 1861, consisted of 1,872 thirty-tAvos, 575 eight-inch, 305 nine-inch Dahlgrens, 46 ten-inch, old and now, 32 eleven-inch Dahlgrens ; making 2,830 heavy guns; Avith 29 twenty-fours, 107 twelves, and 136 boat howitzers* We have now 1,202 howitzers of all kinds, 1,872 thir tv-tAvos, 575 eight-inch, 808 nine-inch Dahl grens, 56 ten-inch, old and uoav, 323 cloven inch Dahlgrens, 200 thirteen-inch mortars, 21 UtAveiity-pound Parrotts, 237 thirty-pound Parrotts, 180 onc-lnmdred-pound Parrotts, 60 one Innulred-aiul-fifty-pound Parrotts, 13 twen ty-pound rifled Parrotts, and 36 fifteen-inch smooth-bores; in all 5,777 pieces, against 2,966 in 1861. Over 700 more guns of the new sort Avill be done before the year closes. Several new foundries have been started, and the means arc uoav equal to tho demand. The enormous amount of projectiles used may he sci'ii in the following figures: Shells, made and bought, 678,617; shot 80,392; shrapnall, grape, and cannistcr, 9,443,948 pounds. Of gunpowder, 2,980 tuns have been ordered since March 1, 1861—of Avhich 2,676 tuns Avere from foreign niter. The report details operations in small-arms, gun-carriages, fuses, &c. All this appertains to the Navy alone. — The report says : “ The general efficiency of the ordnance of our Navy far excels that of any other, its superiority being due mainly, or wholly, to the improvements of the last two years. Further extensive improvements are iu contemplation, and estimates in accordance arc presented to Congress.” THE 

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of the Interior is a clear and comprehensive document. Sec retary Usher reviews the operations of his Bu reau in the fullest detail, and, in general slioavs very satisfactory results, accompanied by sensi ble suggestions. One of these suggestions is that a moderate tax bo levied on the product of the gold mines, which are uoav unburden ed iu that respect. Indian affairs are re vicAved at length, and the setting apart of now and larger reservations is urged; the Pension Bureau is rapidly increasing in its number of pensioners, Avhich uoav reach IS - 659 from the army and 1,132 from the navy, requiring an outlay of fully $1,500,000 per annum; the Patent Office has issued near ly four thousand patents during tho past year; the Government Asylum for the Insane has greatly enlarged its sphere of usefulness by affording a refuge for many of the unfortu nates of the Avar, and the Institution for the Deal, Dumb and Blind has been managed with great success ; good progress has been made on the Capitol extension, and nearly all the works of art designed to cmbelish the Capitol building have been completed and put in their places. In reference to the Afri can Slave trade, the Secretary says not a sin gle vessel is known to have been fitted out for that purpose in our own waters during tho past year. An indisposition on the part of the negroes to colonize is noted, and in A*icw of the uoav policy of the Government toward them it is uoav questionable Avhether the ef fort should be kept up. It is suggested that thousands of free colored laborers may* bo profitably employed in the construction of the Pacific Railroad. The establishment of a Bureau of National Statistics is earnestly recommended, because it Avill contribute to the advancement of all the public interests —commerce, agriculture, finance, &c.—and enable the Government to permanently pre serve tho experience and statistical knowl edge it has gained. The rest of the report treats mainly of affairs iu the District of Co lumbia, all of Avhich are represented as in' commendable shape. Accompanying tho report of the Secretary of the Interior is that of the Commissioner of the General Land Office. The great struggle in Avhich' the country is engaged still tends to retard the purchase and settlement of the public domain, and as a source of revenue the public land sales cannot bo depended on at present. But the operations of the Home stead Law are encouraging, a million and a half acres having been taken up under that law during the past year. Tho other opera tions ol tho Laud Office haA*e boon of a minor character; some few surveys have been com pleted, others contracted for, and several new boundaries established. But the most important part of the report is that relating to the minerals. A full description of the mines,their locality and extent, is given, which shows that every State and Territory border ing on the Rocky Mountains, or extending to tho 1 acific, is rich iu all tho precious metals, and that the vast wealth ot those mines is offiy just beginning to be developed. Idaho* Colorado, Washington, Nevada and ]Arizona, to say nothing of California and Oregon, are vast placers of gold and silver, as well as lead, tin, coal, Ac. The gigantic wealth of those countr es can scarcely bo conceived. Tin* Secretary recommends a tax upon the gold products of the country. PENSION BUREAU. Onl\ 18 Revolutionary pensioners remain on the official rolls, drawing the small sum of $1,044.82 last year ; 1,573 Avidows of Revo lutionary soldiers are still pensioned and took $132,236.74. Up to June 30th last, there Avere 7,248 Army invalid pensioners, drawing $383,670.67 ; widows, orphans, and dependent mothers, 4,820; admitted during last year, 3,630; amount paid, $342,731.37. Army pen sioners added during the year, 7,582. Navy pensions granted for year ending June 30, IS.>; whole number, 544; amount paid, $23,- 622.24. h idoAvs, orphans, and dependent mothers on Navy list, 577; amount paid, $116,449; number added auring the year 316. Whole number of Army pensioners on the list June 30, 13,659; pensions due them, $1,22*7,<>41.88. Whole number of Navy pen sioners, 1,132 , due, *144.074.61. During the vear there has been a decrease of 12 Revo lutionary pensioueis, and 277 widows ol such; an increase of 3,370 army invalid pensioners, 3,385 widows and ■ ns of such ; 123 navy invalids. 94 widows of such ; and 1 increase on private pensions—net increase, 6,632. The annual rate in money has increased from $921,076 69 to $1,371,376.49; the amount paid from $*790,384.76 to $1,025,- 135.91. There have been 602 land warrants granted, covering 94,280 acres. The grants for three years are: ISCI, 834,720 acres; 1862, 257,*860; 1863, 94,280. Since the Government was organized, 65,896,142 acres have gone for military and naval service; value, $82,370,175.50. Whole amount paid to June 30, 1863, $91,693,690.97; total land increase, $174,063,837.47. Claims are acted upon Avith reasonable facility; those properly presented are generally decid ed within two months. Examining Surgeons have been increased to over 600, with bene fit to the Government. The requirements for the current year will be $4,084,792.88. — The Invalid Corps has now* 14,000 men, and is of advantage both to the soldier and the Government, relieving the pension list of a heavy burden, and securing to the soldier adequate pay, and to the country efficient de fenders. POSTMASTER GENERAL. The report of the Postmaster General states the receipts of the year at $11,163,789.59, and the expenditures at $11,314,206.84, leav ing a deficiency of $150,417.25. Within an other '.ear it is expected to be self-sustaining. In 1860 the excess of expenditures tvas $3,- 560,566.05. The cost of postal service is $3,500,000 less than before the rebellion, Avhile the receipts haA*e increased more than 2,000,000. The increase of Revenue over 1862, is $2,863,968.69. The number of Post Offices, including the rebel States, is 29,047, bcingbm increase du ring the year, of 172. The President ap points 550 Postmasters, and the Postmaster General 28,497. Eight hundred and thirty Post Offices have been established during the year, and 658 discontinued. In July the system of delivering mail mat ter by carriers, tvas put into operation at forty-nine of the larger offices. Experience demonstrates that correspondence increases Avitli every facility for its conduct. In Ncav York there were delivered by carriers, 2,069,- 118 letters, and 1,810,717 Avere collected by them during the first quarter, being an in crease of *968,829 letters, or 25 per cent, over the last quarter of the preceding year under the old system. The postage on foreign let ters Avas $1,225,675.21, an increase of SBO,- 579.39 oA*er last year. Of this amount, $757,- 030 Avas collected in the United States, and $167,636.22 iu Europe. The postage on Can ada letters was $225,743.30, or $47,989.7*9 over last year. Of this, $124,480.45 Avas col lected in the United States, and $101,262.83 in the British provinces. No progress has been made in negotiations for a ncAv postal convention Avith Prussia. A grand International Postal Convention was hold in Paris, iu May last, and thirty-one arti cles agreed upon. Among other things, it is agreed that, Avherever it is possible, prepay ment on ordinary letters shall be at the op tion of the sender. Registered letters must be prepaid in all cases. The metrical deci mal system shall bo adopted for international postal relations, to the exclusion of every other system. Our object is to establish uni form rates for all countries, as far as possi ble. A reduction of postal rates, combined Avith a large increase of postal correspond ence, Avill result from tho uoav system. This Convention Avas held at the suggestion of the Hon. John A. Kasson, avlio Avas the able American representative in it. Tho mail Avas carried by rail 22,871,558 miles, at a cost of 11 cents per mile; by steamboat, 2,004,771 miles, at 11 1-5 cents, and by other mode -31, 31*9,686 miles at 91 cents per mile. The total cost of transportation, including the sal aries of agents, Avas $6,236,622. Too in crease of transportation over 1862 is $2.7*93,- 490 miles, at a decrease in cost of $113,253. The number of post offices in operation dur ing the year was, 20,645. The number of dead letters received and examined was 2,550,416, or 268,396 more than last year.— The number containing money Avas 18,527, amounting to $77,861, sluming an increase of 8,052 letters, and in money of $31,322. Of these, 15,048 Avere delivered to their OAvuers, but many of them Avere sent out a second time, and some three or four times before reaching them. The number of dead letters covering valuable papers Avas B,332,represen ting $15,444,277 81. The dead letters con taining photographs numbered 10,918; those containing jcAvelry, 764, and 897 Avitli other articles. Of the aaJiolc number sent to the dead letter office, 8,273 Avere restored to tho Avriters. The loss of valuable letters from the army is largely traceable to dishonest let ter carriers in the military sendee,ami further loss is attributed to indifference and careless ness on the part of some avlio distribute mail matter in our armies. Many matters of less interest are treated of in the report. * One Beetle Siimall Stories. —Dor vas von sun mit der east up in dor mornin’ sky. Dat Avas long time ago. Day Avas proke. Dat Avas nice.

Section 5 gives the informer half the fine. Senator Foote introduced a bill granting public lands to the People’s Pacific R. R. and Telegraph line, by the northern route, and asked that the bill bo referred to a special committee. The motions of reference of the respective subjects embraced in the President’s Mess," were then entertained, and the same ere referred to the appointed committees. Senator Lane, of Indiana, introduced a bill to amend the act entitled “an act to define and punish conspiracies,” passed Jui \ 31st, 1861 ; also the 24th section of the act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, passed March 3d, 1863. Senator Hendricks introduced a bill to ex tend the time in which States may avail themselves of the grant of land for Agricul tural and Industrial Colleges. Senator Davis, of Kentucky, called up the resolutions in relation to the exchange of prisoners, arguing vehemently against the policy of refusing an exchange to our suffer ing white soldiers—the languishing, starving, and diseased white men—because the rebeis refuse to exchange the negro captives. He denounced at length the policy of the Admin istration upon the several points in which the negro is affected, characterizing its position as monstrous, and referring to the present era as the reign of Abraham First. lie aver ed that his own loyalty was unspotted, that lie hated with undying vigor the crime of secession. It was evident, he said, that this policy was only a part of that design to per petuate the party power of the Administra tion. He closed with an indignant and ear nest protest against the refusal of the Admin istration to liberate thousands of starving and dying white men for the sake of a few ne groes. Senator Johnson deemed it perfectly clear that humanity, which is the highest policy, demanded the continuance of the exchange of prisoners. lie proceeded to combat the opin ions of the Senator from Kentucky, (Davis) that these men should not be protected, and corrected his views of the power of the Pres ident, by quoting from the Constitution rela tive to the executive and the legislative pow ers. Senator Davis replied, saying the preamble of the Constitution confers no power on the Government. The Supreme Court kad so in terpreted it. He also claimed that the Presi dent had no right to suspend the writ ot habeas corpus, which was a legislative and not an ex ecutive function. The powers to be exercis ed are conferred by the Constitution alone, and there are no powers vested in the Gov ernment which are not conferred by the Con stitution ; hence, the President cannot raise troops or armies, nor has the power to organ ize any measure to put down insurrections without the assent of Congress. It was the determination of the party in power that the war shall continue till the next Presidential election. The war would have been brought to a close long ago, if the Administration had singly and in good faith devoted itself to the principles announced in the Crittenden reso lution, and if the commanders of the armies had not beon selected, not because of their hostility to the rebels, but because of their opposition to slavery. Senator Hale, of N. H., rose to indignantly deny that it was the desire of the gentlemen ou this floor to continue the war in order to influence the next Presidential election. A more atrocious allegation against honorable men was never listened to from the begin ning of time to the present moment. If the allegations of the Senator were true, he would rather take into his own hand the hand of a man from the charnel-house reeking with pestilence, than the hands of those around him. If the allegation was true, then every Senator was stamped with the foulest treason and perjury. The destinies of the country have been submitted to the gentle men around him, who are bound by their oath to sustain the country and the constitu tion, and defend the fire-sides and homes threatened by invasion, while the Senator from Kentucky says they arc hypocrites, and do not mean to sustain these objects. Senator Davis explained that ho had refer ence to those in power. Senator Hale replied that the Senator had made an allegation which embraced every Senator. It was an allegation which, if true, would disgrace the vilest inmate of a peni tentiary. The character of the President was also included in this allegation. He be lieved there was one thing to which every body assented, that President Lincoln is emi nently an honest and patriotic man. To-day, for the first time, he had heard the honesty and patriotism of the Executive questioned. If the Government has called for black sol diers to take up and calls them out to fight the battles of the country, it is bound to protect them at all hazards and by every means it can put forth. The Government having used them, and they having become prisoners, if they are abandoned to their fate it is guilty of baseness unparalleled in histo ry. The party in power has one aim, and that aim is the country; but one purpose, and that is the salvation of the country. — The idea that the Administration and its sup porters desire the continuation of the war, in order to control the next Presidential elec tion —desire this cruel war, with its cries of anguish, with our sons given to slaughter, our widows in mourning and our kindred to de structioc—is an insinuation so base that he wondered it found its way even into the fer tile brain of the Senator from Kentucky.— [Applause in the galleries.] Ihe pending resolution of Mr. Davis was referred to the Military Committee. 

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. The Speaker laid before the House a mes sago from the President, cordially recommend ing that L apt. John Rogers, who captured the ui t ■ ngol, for his distinguished zeal, bravery and general good conduct, receive a vote of thanks from Congress, this preliminary being required by law in order that he may be ad vanced one grade in the navy. The bill to increase the pay in the army meets with general favor and will soon be reported back. Mr. Stevens, of Pa , introduced a series of resolutions referring the various branches of the President’s message to the appropriate committees, and that part with reference to the treatment and condition of rebellious' States to a select committee of nine, to be appointed by the Speaker. Mr. Davis of Maryland, offered as a substi tute, that so much of the President’s Message as related to the duty of the United States to guarantee to any State a republican form of government and restore it to those states in which the government has been abrogated or overthrown be referred to a select committee of nine, who shall report the bills necessary to carry into effect this duty. Mr. Brooks of New York said if the pro position of Davis should be persisted in, he should be disposed to add that this special committee also enquire whether a Republican government has not been abrogated and over thrown in the North* as well as in the South since the revolution began. Mr. Lovejoy said that in spite of certain individuals there still exists a Republican government in all the States of the North w ithout abridgement or abatement. He was for the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was, and not as it has been falsely in terpreted. He would dispossess the slave holders of the Union as he would those who seized the Chesapeake. lie would put a loyal crow on board and sail the good ship Union as our fathers framed it. Mr. Davis’ substitute was adopted, yeas SO, nays SO. On motion of Cox, of Ohio, it was resolved that the seven additional standing committees appointed under rule No. 152, be directed at once to perform the duties prescribed by said rule, and examine into the state of the ac counts and expenditures of the several de partments respectively submitted to them and report particularly as specified in said rule ; and further that said committees have all the power of committees of investigation. All of Stevens’ resolutions were then agreed to. On motion of Mr. Cox, of Ohio, the follow ing resolution introduced by him yesterday was adopted: Resolved, That the Secretary of War be directed to communicate to this House the report made by Maj. Gen. McClellan concerning the organization and operations of the Army of the I‘otomac while under ins command, and of all army operations while he was eommandcr-in-chief. The House then adjourned.

Senator \\ osou reported back the joint ■ ’ntiuii tendering the thanks of Congress to Major General Grant and the officers and men of his command, with the recommenda tion for its passage, which was adopted. Senator Lane, of Kansas, introduced a res olution of inquiry relative to the treatment by the rebels of our Kansas prisoners. He made the statement that Capt. Brown at Osceola last summer saw in one of the pris ons of the South seven Kansas soldiers in irons among other prisoners not in irons, and he understood they were to be put to death as others had been. The Secretary of War communicated these facts to the commission er of exchange, but received no satisfactory information. Such had also been the course pwcvtcd by tpmatrcll and others 5n their raids in the vicinity of Kansas. The resolu tion was adopted. The House joint resolution for adjourment till after the holidays being called up, Sena tor Fessenden moved it be laid on .the table. The motion was lost. Yeas 19, nays 25.

A resolution was introduced instructing the committee on Military Affairs to inquire into the alleged inhumanity of the enemy towards our wounded soldiers in the field. Numerous other resolutions were intro duced, among them one by Rollins of Mo., declaring that this House is prompted by just patriotism in favoring the zealous prosecution of the war which was inaugurated by the dis unionists; that it is the duty of the Govern ment to prosecute the war until obedience to the constitution and the laws is secured, and that the war shall not be prosecuted for the purpose of conquest or subjugation. Mr. Lovejoy, of 111., moved to lay the reso lution on the table, which was lost by yeas 50 nays 114. Debate arising on the resolution, it was laid over. The House then resolved that when it ad journed on Wednesday next it be till the sth of January. SENATE. Washington, Dec. 17. Senator Hale rose to a privileged question, lie desired to send to the Clerk to read, a newspaper paragraph, charging with bribery a Senator from New England, in securing the release for the Sum of £3,000, of two prison ers from the old Capitol Prison. From infor mation received from a Senator, he was led to believe that he (Hale,) was tire person al luded to. He wished to make a statement of the facts on which the charge was founded. Senator Hale then, at some length, ex plained that he had acted as counsel lor those persons, and that he had asked the advice of lion. Rcverdy Johnson and oth'K-s if he could, consistenly with his position as a United States Senator, act as the legal adviser of the above mentioned parties. Ho was assured he could ; that there existed no reason why he should not. Hon. Reverdy Johnson stated to him that he was himself engaged in such cases almost daily. Under these circum stances he had acted for the prisoners. He (Hale) then stated the facts of the case, and concluded by saying that what he had done in the premises was not done inadvertently but advisedly, and with cautious deliberation. Senator Johnson remarked that he recol lected distinctly that Senator Hale called on him as stated, and reported the conversation materially as stated. In answer to his (Hale’s) inquiry whether a Senator was prevented from acting as counsel for prisoners charged before a court martial with fraud, he (Johnson) said he saw no legal impediment in the way or even indelicacy. What the Senator had done was no doubt done in con sequence of this opinion. Senators do not cease to be lawyers if called upon for pro fessional services. lie saw no difficlty in complying unless the services involved the neglect of public duties. He (Johnson) had repeatedly acted himself upon this assump tion. The only question that can arise is the possibility of enacting any law to prevent it. There was a law preventing Senators from prosecuting suits against the govern ment before the Court of Claims. He be lieved one has a right to go before any other court in the United States. It was not the intention of the law to prevent a lawyer prac tising in his profession. Senator Hale submitted the following reso lution, which was adopted: R-solved, That thu Committrc on the Judiciary be instructed to inquire whether John P. Hale, a member ol this body, ia connection with the case of one Hunt, charged with crime by direction of the War Department, has been guilty of any con duct inconsistent with his duty as a Senator, and that they have power to send for persons and pa pers. The following resolution, submitted by Mr. M ade, was agreed to ; Jt-scirtd, That the Secretary of the Navy be di rected to communicate to the Senate all official dispatches and papers in the Navy Department relative to actions in which any armed vessels have been engaged. On motion of Senator Lane, of Kansas, it was resolved that the committee on post offi ces and post roads be instructed to inquire into the propriety of establishing what is now known as the military road from Lawrence to Fort Scott as a post road. Senator Lane introduced a bill to grant land to the citizens of Kansas to indemnify them for losses. On motion of Senator Sprague the bounty pay bill wps taken up, and re-committed to the committee on military affairs. A document from the Secretary of the Treasury was received, xminmnicating the report ot Prof. A. D. Bachc, for the vear ending May Ist, ISfi;;, and the report of 1 homas Brown, agent of the Treasury in California. The resolution ot the House for an adjourn ment was taken up. Senator Sherman moved an amendment by striking out the words “ this House adjourns,” and inserting the two Houses of Congress adjourn.” Carried. On motion of Senator Sherman it was voted to postpone the consideration of the resolution until Tuesday next. The following letter was received from the Piesident: I herewith lay before you a letter ad dressed to myself, by gentlemen represent ing the Freedmen’s Societies in Boston, Now York, Philadelphia and Cincinnati. Thesub ject of the letter as indicated above is one of great magnitude and importance, and one which these gentlemen of known ability and high character seem to have considered with care. Not having time to form a mature judgment of my own, as to whether the plan they suggest is the best, I submit the whole subject to Congress, deeming that their atten tion thereto is almost imperatively demanded. [Signed,] Abraham Lincoln. Mr. Foote moved that when the Senate adjourn it adjourn till Monday next. Adjourned. lIOOSK OF
