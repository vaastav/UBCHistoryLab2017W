CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS. Both houses of Congress assembled at noon on Monday of last week, and the President's message was read. In the Senate the ere* dentials "of Messrs. Edmunds, of Vermont, and Eaton, of Connecticut, for the senatorial term comipenoing March 4, 1S75, were pre* sected. Mr. Morrill, of a joint select com mittee, reported Btatutes providing for a form of government tor the District of Colombia. A petition was presented from Admiral Wor den and his command for prize money for de stroyiog the Confederate ram Merrimac, on the same principle that compensation was awarded the crew ol the Kesrsarge for de stroying the Alabama. In the House of Rep resentatives an unsuccessful effort was made for immediate consideration of a bill to repeal the Poland "gig-law." After the President's message was read, the legislative, naval, army, Indian and fortification appropriation bills were reported, and referred to the committee of the whole. A bill was passed appropri ating fands to purchase scales to be used by the Postofficc Department, under the new postage law. In the Senate, on Tuesday, a bill was in troduced to fix the salary ot the President ot the United States at S25.UU0 alter tho term ui the present incumbent ; also directing the Postmaster General to cause to be constructed a lino of telegraph between Washington and l>o$t>a, via Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and Hartford, to- be operated in the posteCcos ia those cities by persona to be ap pointed by the Postmaster General. In the ilousc ox lior-resetitatives a iaiue u umber ot bills were introduced and referred, among them a biil to reduce tbe Preiideui'ssalary tu S25,00i); to substitute United States notes tor issues ol national banks; to disqualify numbers oi Congress ir.iui holding ..Siee under tic United States if'they aet as uouuset tor defendants ia suits by the government for revenue frauds (this bill was passed ;) making valid betore the treasury ail permits to pur chase products ot the insurrectionary Stues granted by the President during the iate war; to authorize free banking ; to continue the lm p-rovctaent of the Great Kanawha river in West Virginia; abolishing the use of stamps On checks, drafts, &e. ; to amend the enloree t-.ent act.

Dawes, Gar field and Cos. The biil was amended and ordered to be printed. Ia tho Senate, on Wednesday, a petition was presented from the presidents of the Texas Pacific and the Atlantic and Pacific railroads asking Congress to guarantee the payment of the interest on the gold-bearing construction Lands of those companies, and a bill was in troduced to carry out the object ot thepetition. In the House the committee on pnblij lands was authorized to frame a general bill for the relief of all the people who suffered trom the grasshopper plague. iu inc senate, on l nursuay. a joint resoiu tion was passed to appoint George Bancroft a member of tho board of regents of the Smith sonian Institution in place of Gen. Sherman, who lias resigned. The Senate adjourned nntil Monday. In the House, Mr. Stowell, rt" Virginia, asked an investigation into the charge made against him of selling a naval cidetship, denouncing the charge as false.? The committee on naval affairs was directed to inafce die-intc's<ig*tiou. The bill "for the iTiprortment'df'the1 currency and the reduc nterest im tBe^ft?s(ded debt of the TJnifed Statya" yaa considereKfn committee ^eniiijjW^ was offered i$ea,intimid?tion3and .fdveoturora. ; The pxesi ife cotorecT'sociefies-of that c ifl'gtfrated the movement by forming an^Bbeiatiop, tho objects of which are to dis~ card old political ties, and cultivate and main> tain permanent peace with the white people of the South. In an address which they have issued they set forth that tbey have seen and felt and ftill suffer un ier the consequences of the vicious antagonism into which the "mere fictions of poiitica! incendiaries" have led tliem They bring strong indictments agains' their despoilers. '-They have shorn us.'' they say, "of onr pecuniary accumulations, the result of weary years of toil, even pennies accumu lated by our youth and fledgelings All this we couid bear, but they have left u? despised by our ocly true Jriemis through their knavish representations and unmitigated falsehoods." Such expressions, at least, show how keenly the colored reop[p realize their wrongs, now that their eyes are being < pened to their situ ation, and they give an earnest of their dis position to retrain the Uselessly lost confidence of the paft and establish their claims to free dom of thought and action in all that relates to their personal and political interests. "THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE; [Synopsis from the Baltimore Sue.] The most important features of the Presi dent'a message havo > been ao far anticipate! by tho telegraphic synopsis published yes terday in our general press dispatches as ti dispense with the necessity of a recapitulation The lull text of the message invites littli further remark, and still less of unfavorablt criticism. It is moderate, cautious, am thoroughly conservative in tone, and as sue! will eomtneod itself to the majority of th< American qeople Dispensing with the usua commonplaces which have formed almost tht stereotyped commencement of so many mes* Silge>," the President follows the Uoratiai maxim, and plunges at once in medial res.? In the very first paragraph of the message, and with military bluotness and directness o purpose, hn takes the bull of -'the fioancia question" boldly by the.horns. It is gratify g to find th*t upon this all important subject which is pre-eminently agd above all others, tho question of the hour." the President'i trumpet gives no uncertain sound. He de clares in favor of resumption and of a returi to decent money, not merely in the abstrac or in vague and general terms, but explicitly and specifically, urging upon Coniress, "a this session." the doty and necessity o placing the currency of the country upon i basis, common to and recognized by the civi lized world. In this portion of his message in principle?-we do not speak of details?thi Presidents views are as sound as a dollar? and a gold dollar at that. The public credi tor to bo paid in coin, "according to the bont when tho debt was contracted, gold or it equivalent." an obligation not to be evadet ?without national digrace j" the repeal of thi legal-tender clause, take effect as to all con tracts entered into after the day fixed in tht repealing act; a revenue sufficiently in exces of expenditure to insure an accumulation o sold in the treasury to sustain resumption and lastly, a system of free banking as essen sential to give proper elasticity to the cur rency. These are the salient fecommenda tions urged by they President upon Congresi at its present session as necessary to restore the currency to a normal and healthful con dition. Foreign affirrs furnish no special occasiot for remark or recommendation. The growint importance of our relations, both commercia and diplomatic, with China and Jnpan is nd verted to. as is also tho subject of Chincst immigration to this country, coupled with i suggestion as to the need of further legisla tion for the protection of Chinese immigrants both male and feuia'c. The unfinished north western boundary survey between the Unitet States and the British provinces, the chronit condition of lawlessness and brigandage oi the Mexican frontier, anu the no less chronit inability of Venezuela to discharge its in debtedness to American citizens, receivt stereotyped ment'on The duration and ten' acity of the insurrection in Cuba, and tho in jury and annoyance occasioned thereby t< neutral powers are referred to in significan language, and the* fae> of "pending negotia tions" made the excuse for the absence of somi positive suggestion in reference to this sub jeet, as well as the unsettled business ofstb( "Virginius" indemnity. A renewal of for mer recommendations in reference to the de fective state of our naturalization laws, and as the laws regulating tho stuhis of Amoriaan citizens horn abroad, conclutfes what the Pres ident has to say upon topics connected with oui ?'foreign relations." Attention is called to the reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury.of War, the Navy the Interior, and the Postmaster General, in reference to matters belonging to their re spective departments The troubles in Loui siana and Arkansas give the President an op portunity both to explain his past policy in reference to affairs in those States and to in dulge in some general observation and recom mendations in reference to the condition oi the South which are for the most part con ceived and expressed in a moderate and con ciiitorv temper The President deprecates the necessity fot any federal or executive interference in the local concerns of the States, justifies his re cent action in Louisiana by reference to the neglect and failure of Congress at its last ses sion to act upon the recommendations of his former messages, and indicates thst in ref erence to Southern affairs generally, and -'out rages" in particular, the truth is to be looked for between two extremes. An eminently just and proper suggestion in this connection, although found in another portion of the mes sage. is tho recommendation to restore to the list of pensioners of the war of 1S12 the few old persons residiug in the South whose pen sions havo been cut off by their inability tr take the ironclad oath. The creation of twe additional circuit judgeships, with or without the addition of two more justices to tho Su preme Court, is recommended on account ol the increased extent of territory to bo tra versed and business to be transacted in the federal courts The President claims for hid Indian policy, whatever that may be. "the most benefieial results." and promises ad herence to it. For the comparative failure of civil, service reform, the President plainly takes Congress to tusk, and intimates that, al though. himself still in favor of it, he "will have no more o^gjflflBM^np the whole btudiress ?s a^^^^^^^^^^B>ngress comes ?nyt* ?c ~r- t - rtiicy,'"it'?i tfegative rather than poartivoin its character,\nd is calculated to afford bnt "cold comfort" eipher to a greedy lobby or a heated -?pd noreasonvis partisanship. It will proba bly meet withHess adverse criticism and more positive commendation than any message which President Grant has sent to Congress since the commencement of his presidential term. United States Senator.?Wo learn that the prominent friends of Mr Faulkner in this county hold a meeting in this placo last week, at which they unanimously determined that his name should he presented to the nest legislature of West Virginia as a candidate for the position of United States Senator. We nfe not present at the meeting, and therefore may not be accurately informed of its proceedings; but heard that a committee of ten or twelve gentlemen were appointed to prepare an address to the Senate and House of Delegates, setting forth the grounds upon which in their opinion, he should reoeivc the favorable consideration of those bodies. We need hardly say that this is tho sentiment of the democracy of the county of Berkeley ; and so believing we shall give as we have always done our warm and cordial support to the result of their action.

THE 

PRESIDENT ON SOUTHERN OUTRAGES. While we have giveD the President credit for the general spirit of his message, and the purposes aimed at in it, says the Baltimore Sun, there can be no doubt that on the sub ject of Southern outrages he speaks in a some what ambiguous tone. He thinks that there have been wrongs committed ou both whites and blacks. lie speaks of white leagues and bands of masked and armed men in connec tion with preparations for the late election. There were decided indications, ho thinks, on that occasion of a determination, by acts of violence and intimidation, to deprive citizens of the freedom of the ballot because of their political opinion. IIow far the President may be correctly informed on this subject we will not undertake to say, but it would seem that he is not over confident himself of his facts from tho apparent tone of apology in which he justifies his interference in Southern affairs, while at tho same time professing to regret its necessity. He confesses that Southern citi zens have suffered grievous wrongs, and admits that "the better part of them" have "a dispo sition to be law-abiding and to do no violence either to individuals or to the laws existing," and says that he "sympathizes with their pros trate condition, and would do all in his power to relievo them, acknowledging that they have had most frying governments to live under, and very oppressive ones in tho way of taxation." The late elections indicate that the American people concur in this view of the Southern situation, and emphatically show that they do not concur with the President in his belief of outrages to such an extent upon any class of voters in the South as to justify federal interference.
