Senate Passes Tillman Resolu tion and Adjourns Till Monday. Washington, Dec. 7. The house re jected the amendment of Mr. Williams fixing the amount of the canal appro priation at $6,580,333, and adopted an amendment fixing the amount at $11, 000,000. Representative Morrill (Pa.) today introduced a bill placing- insurance companies under the control and su pervision of the department of com merce and labor and a second insur ance bill extending the sovereign vis itorial power of the United States over life insurance companies and other corporations organized under state laws. Reading of the Panama canal ap propriation bill was resumed in the house on the convening of that body today. The first amendment was presented by Mr. Williams. He moved to cut the appropriation from $16,500,000 to $6,S5S,333, stating that he had come to the conclusion that this latter sum was sufficient to meet the needs of the commission to January 1 next. The amount had been arrived at by taking the indebtedness of the com mission which they had staled was $4,500,000. He had added to this the December estimates amounting to $:VJ58,333. The point was made by Mr. Tawney. that it was impossible to segregate from the estimates the liabilities of the commission due in December on equipment purchased by the commis sion. It was contended by Mr. Wil- j liams that these supplies were not to be delivered until June and payment need not be made until delivery. Mr. Tawney held that payment might be necessary before delivery, according to terms of purchase. An amendment to that of Mr. Wil liams was offered by Mr. Prince (111.) making the appropriation $10,000,000. leasing his argument on the speedy appointment of committees, which, he said, should take up and make a care ful examination of the estimates fur nished, Mr. Prince was of opinion that $ ! o.Ooo.OOO was a sufficient . sum to meet all emergence- necessities. He also opposed the issuance of bonds. He said there was $136,000,000 in the treasury and $55,000,000 of govern ment monev in national banks. Mr. Clark (Mo.) asked Mr. Hep burn if all or most of the supplies for the canal were not purchased by the New York and Washington purchasing agents, although other agents were located at New Orleans and Tacoma. Mr. Hepburn had no information. Mr. Clark: "How many ships have we ?" "Five." "Why don't some of them ply be tween New Orleans and Panama?" "I can not say." "What I want to say is that in my opinoin discrimination is being made aeainst all that territory drained by the Mississippi river and I maintain that cheaper, all water rates could be made from Pittsburg by way of New Orleans than by New York." A provision which would operate to reimburse the treasury for the $10,000,000 already expended to the construction of the canal from the sale of the canal bonds was proposed by Mr. Overstreet (Ind.) Vigorous opposition to this was made by Mr. Williams (Miss.) who dra matically epaculated: "Take this step if you dare. The Democracy challenges vr. There is a drop of water somewhere which will overflow the cup. What excuse are you to offer the American people for borrowing money at 2 per cent, when you already have abundant funds in the treasury and deposited in national banks. ?" IX THE SENATE Tillman's Resolution Passes and Ad journment Till Monday Follows. Washington, Dec. 7. At the begin ning of today session of the senate the vice president designated Messrs. Lodge and IJacon to serve on tho board of regents of the Smithsonian inst i tution. Mr. Tillman called up his resolution calling upon the secretary of the treasury for information as to whether the reports of bank examiners show 'he payment of campaign, contribu tions by national banks and addressed the senate. Outlining his reason for the inquiry he called attention to the recommendation by the president in his annual messages of 1904 and 1905 for the enactment of a law for protec tion against bribery and corruption in connection with elections. He quoted vlih special emphasis the president's remarks concerning campaign contri butions by corporations. "Our chief executive has taken a very progressive stand to secure purity tn emotions." he said and added: Kvory good American will sav "well done' and look for progress along that line." liefore Mr. Tiliman had proceeded far Mr. Calimgher. who yesterday object ed to the consideration of the resolu tion at that time, said that he had don so only for the purpose of inspecting it, that he h.-id done so and bcinz entirely satisfied as to its propriety would sup port the resolution. Continuing Mr. Tillman said: "I am the holder of a small nolicy in one of the mutuals, and I don't like to have my dividends cut down in or der to give Mr. McCurdy $150,000 and rns sisters, his cousins and his aunts J.j.OiiO each." He expressed doubt as to the right of the federal authorities to take control of insurance companies and Mr Hale interrupted to say that he agreed with Mr. Tillman on that point. He said further that the provision for such a ja m eerling was not properlv considered and he did not consider it binding. Washington, Dee. 7 The senate pass ed the resolution of Senator Tillman end at 2:18 they adjourned until Mon-dnf. SHE 

TRIES TO ESCAPE. Mrs. Berry Made Dash for Liberty Out of Sheriff's Window. Girard, Kan., Dec. 7. Mrs. Berry, captured yesterday with the aid of ammonia, after she had held posses sion of a railway coach here for nearly five days, attempted to escape today from the sheriff's office where she is imprisoned. She was caught climbing out of a window and pulled back. She was afraid, she said, that the officers intend to lock her up. No word has been received from the woman's rela tives and she probably will be given a hearing on a charge of insanity. WHO CAPTURED MRS. BERRY? One of the Leading Topics of Conver sation at Girard. Girard, Kan., Dec. 7. An hour after her capture here in the Frisco car, where she had barricaded herself for four and one-half days, Mrs. Berry, the insane woman, sank into a profound sleep, from which she awoke about 6 o'clock last night. She is being cared for at the county jail by Mrs. Edward Walsh, wife of the sheriff who led in her cap ture. Mrs. Berry's eyes are still swollen from the ammonia fumes used to over come her. Dr. L. P. Adamson, who is attending the woman, has notbeen able to discover serious ill effects from her long vigil against capture. Her slumber is sound and apparently healthful. "I have been foolish, haven't I, Mr. Sheriff?" she said. "If I had only be lieved that you are my friend, as I know you are now, I wouldn't have shot at all. Did I hurt anybody? The shoot ing is what makes me most sorry for what has happened in this town." She was not in condition to be taken before the probate court, and as she is not a citizen of the state the matter of future action has not been fully decided on, but she will be well cared for and guarded. The opinion is general here that if the crowds which gathered daily about the car wherein Mrs. Berry held half the town in check had been dispersed and kept away she would have calmed down and become amenable to suggestion long before. "Tuesday night I visited the car," said Postmaster Wasson, "and found it faced by a noisy crowd of 200 men and boys who were making fun of Mrs. Berry's plight. There were dog fights going on and uproar enough to drive anyone crazy. That sort of thing, continued day and night, only added fuel to the wo man's first fear of mob violence." There are a few peopf here who be lieve now that Mrs. Berry's dementia is only temporary and that when she wakes she will have imperfect memory of the events of the past five days. Expert opinion, however, is that she is hope lessly insane, but will remain tractable so long as she is handled properly. To the community of Girard Mrs. Berry's experience has been a big hap pening. Apart from humane interest in the case, which has been more or less in tense all along, the humor of the situa tion, arising from the clash of opinion and authority over the matter of her capture is beginning to dawn on the town. Discussion of the case was al most sheepish. Who really did capture Mrs. Berry, who grabbed her first, is a topic of disputation which is fast engen dering feeling in the town. W. L. Petty says he did it. "You see, the Frisco people want first credit, the county claims it, while the town of Walnut Grove boasts the honor of possessing the true hero," said a Girard editor. "Looks as if a communi ty split along a new line is inevitable here." Knot3 of disputing citizens stood about the public square thrashing out the facts of the capture. "I seen this feller Petty from Walnut Grove grab her first," vouched one of the disputants. "Now, what's the use of sayin' that. Hank, 'cause my boy was right there an' seen the sheriff git her," was the re joinder. "Aw. the .Sheriff wasn't no where near her when Petty busted the door in. Monahan, that railroad detective, got her." SHE WILL HANG. Execution of Mrs. Mary Rogers Is Almost Due. Windsor, Vt., Dec. 7. With the ap pointed time of her execution not 2 4 hours distant Mrs. Mary M. Rogers spent today in her cell at the state prison apparently in utter indifference as to the issue which she is to face to morrow. During the afternoon the gallows were erected and tested. The execution is expected to take place at about 1 p. m. WICHITA GIRL TAKEN HOME. Mabel Gallasher Made a Record Dur ing Brief stay in Topeka. Mrs. Shields, police matron at Wich ita, came to Topeka today after Mabel Gallagher, a young woman who was picked up by the police Sunday night. The girl is so small that the officers suspected her of being under 16 years of age, but have learned since that she came to Topeka from Atchison, and has been an inmate of two lower Kan sas avenue resorts. Mrs. Shields will take the girl to Wichita, where her mother lives, to night. CHAfiCE FOR VERHOH. His Friends Believe He Will Land Appointment. Washington, Dec. 7. Senator Long, Representative Campbell and D. W. Mulvane this morning called on Secre tary Shaw in behalf of W. T. Vernon, the colored orator, and came away greatly encouraged with the prospects of landing Vernon for register of the treasury. The president has left this matter to Mr. Shaw for recommenda tion, the place desired by Vernon be ing under Secretary Shaw's super vision. J I. J.

He has lived in Denver for 12 years. His daughter. Lottie Page, has often visited in Tcceka. PA LUXE MARKHAM ILL. Old Time Stage Favorite Is Attacked by Measles. New York, Dec. 7. Pauline Mark ham, a stage beauty of 3a years ago, when she came to the United States in Lydia Thompson's burlesque company, is seriously ill at her home in this city, suffering from measles. Miss Markhani in private life is the wife of Adelard Gravel, a printer, and is now more than 60 years old and greatly changed from the days when her accents were de scribed as "vocal velvet," and when she was said to have "the lost arms of the Venus of Milo," but even in sick ness she maintains her cheerfulness and even a sprightly humor. "If I have to be ill," she says, "I'm glad it's measles, for it shows I'm still young enough ior that." Her husband is in moderately prosperous circumstances and the home of the couple is a comfortably furnished fiat in West 100th street. Hi THE OLD BREWERY. Charged That This One Was Used as a Liquor Selling Establishment. "The Old Eudora Brewerv.," said to be the first brewery established in the state of Kansas, seems to be striv ing to keep up its reputation. A joint case was appealed to the supreme court yesterday from Douglas county, in which the old brewery is the cen ter of the disturbance. Eudora is eight miles from Law rence and was settled by a party of German colonists from the east in the early days of Kansas. One of the first institutions established was a turn verein; the brewery followed. Of late years, however, the brewery ha"s fallen into wreck. There is now left of it only one or two rooms and the old "spring cellar," in which bubbles up a spring of living water. But in the remaining rooms, a German social club established itself and Fred Lorenz became the steward of the club. When Douglas county felt the wave of reform, the sheriff raided the old Eudora brewery and took into cus tody one Fred Lorenz and a lot of wet goods, including fifteen cases cf beer and ten gallons kegs of whisky. Lo renz insisted that he was merely steward for the club and did not real ly sell liquor. He simply served it to the club members. The initiation fee to this wonderful club was 15 cents; the dues were 15 cents a month. When a man went in there ana wanted a lunch he was given the lunch and a bottle of beer on the side. The place proved to be one of the most popular restaurants in town. The testimony at the trial showed that many people came, there and paid their money for lunch, getting the bot tle of beer apparently as a token of good will on the part of the proprietor. But there was enough evidence to warrant the jury in bringing in a ver dict of guilty on two counts against Lorenz and the judge sentenced him to pay a fine of $200 and serve 120 days in jail. Lorenz now appeals to the supreme court. , Another Douglas county liquor case which came up along with the Lor enz case yesterday was that of the state vs. William Callahan. Callahan is a Lawrence merchant whose place of business was in the 1800 block on Massac htisetts street. The front end of his store was a place for the sale of cigars, tobacco and candy. In the back end of the establishment he is said to have kept something strong er. When the officers raided the es tablishment, they found twelve bottles of "Hoppine" and ten bottles of "Vera," a Ferd Heim priia ration made for sale in Kansas and marked "non-intoxicating." There was evidence, however, that beer was kept in the place and Cal lahan admitted that he might have had a few bottles there for his own use, but declared that he never sold anything intoxicating. His stock of "Hoppine" had just come in when the officers raided his place. Mr. Calla han was very much astonished and grieved that he should be suspected of keeping a joint, and as he had a bar rel full of "Hoppine" bottles, which had not been opened, he shipped the whole lot back to Kansas City in righteous indignation that they should have imposed on him by sending him something which was intoxicating. The jury found Mr. Callahan guilty upon two counts and he was sentenced to serve 120 days and pay $200 fine. " OUT GOES HE. Governor Hanly Calls for Resignation of His Adjutant General. Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 7. John R. Ward, adjutant general of Indiana, re signed today on the demand of Gov ernor Hanly. An investigating com mittee claims there is a shortage of $976.75, which it is alleged was se cured by General Ward by padding the totals on his requisitions for the pay of the 4 4 companies of the In diana national guard and on warrants for supplies for the troops. General Ward was adjutant of the One Hun dred and Sixty-first Indiana regiment in the Spanish-American war of which regiment former Governor Durbin was colonel. The alleged shortage discov ered extends back to December, 1903. HOHIHWiOHrSENT IN. The President Appoints a Number of Federal Judges. Washington, Dec. 7.

ENGINES DEMOLISHED. Three Cars Burned and Several Bodies Incinerated. Crew of Freight Train Failed to Ooey Orders. Omaha, Neb., Dec. 7. -Nine persons were killed and eleven train employes and eight passengers were Injured in a wreck of overland limited passenger train No. 2 on the Union Pacific five miles west of Rock Springs, Wye, just before 2 o'clock this morning. The limited was run into head-on by a freight train and both engines were demolished and the baggage car, mail car and dining car on the limited were burned up. Several bodies of the dead were incinerated. The, Dead. FIRST COOK JAMES BUSBEE, Omaha. SECOND COOK ED ROSENBAUM Oakland, Cal. FOURTH COOK JOHN LAWSON, Omaha. TWO MAIL CLERKS, names not given. ELECTRICIAN STIGERS AND AS SISTANT ENGINEER BRINK of Rawlins. BRAKEMAN SMITH of Rawlin3. Employes Injured. T. J. Smith, waiter; Oakland, Cal. R. S. Mitchell, waiter; Oakland, Cal. W. D.

The three dead cooks are all white men and the waiters were colored. An extra freight train was given an order before it left Rock Springs to meet four eastbound passenger trains, of which the Overland limited was the last one, at Ah Say, a siding five miles west of Rock Springs. The freight took the siding at Ah Say and waited until three of these trains had passed east and then pulled out. When a mile and a half west of Ah Say the freight met the limited and crashed into it nead on. Both engines were demolished and the first three cars of the limited im mediately caught fire and were entirely destroyed. Engineer Brink of (he freight irain, who it is stated officially, was responsi ble for overrunning his orders, was one of the killed. Several trains had been badly delayed at Granger with the re sult that the four passenger trains were running close to each other. The freight had received positive orders to meet all four of these trains at Ah Say and the officials say that the orders were either misunderstood or misread. Relief trains with wrecking cara and a large number of physicians were im mediately dispatched from Rock Springs and Granger and are now at the scene of the wreck. The Wyoming state hospital located near Rock Springs was convenient to the point where the wreck occurred and to this institution the injured were re moved and made comfortable without great delay. The extent of the injuries of those caught in the florward cars has not been definitely learned, but it is be lieved none of them will prove fatal, al though several were seriously hurt. The relief trains arrived at the scene of the wreck early this morning, but the injured had been removed before they arrived. A temporary track was con structed around the wreck and traffic was not seriously delayed. HAY DROP BURTON. Senate Discusses Depriving Him of His Committee. Washington, Dec. 7. The resignation of Senator Mitchell as chairman of the senate committee on inter-oceanic canals may affect the Burton case in so far as there i J. possibility of both being left off all committees in the sen ate reorganization. This question is not yet determined but the committee of senators having charge of committee assignments has the point under con sideration. DECISION GOES OVER. Will Not Be Decided This Week, Says the Board. No decision was announced Wednes day by the state board of railroad com missioners in the grocery commodity case. The board put in several hours in the afternoon looking over the evidence and the possible changes, and then de cided that it would be impossible to complete their work this week. It is generally understood, however, that some changes in the existing rates are certain to be made, and that the changes will be favorable to the interior grocery jobbers. The decision in the case will in :.1I probability be announced next Tuesday, when the board meets to consider the grain rate cas. i THIS IS ANOTHER IDEAL DAY. Air Balmy and the Temperature Over 50 Degrees. Today ia good bazaar weather: in fact it is good weather for most every thing excepting for the filling of ice houses with nature's product. The air is warm and balmy and those who last week were shivering even though clad in heavy garments are almost uncom fortable today on account of the heat. The temperature which has been grad ually rising all week continues on its upward course. -- the weather man has promised not to interfere. The little breath which is blowing is from the southwest and is little more than a breeze. The hourly temperatures for the day W'are: 7 O'clock 31 8 o'clock 30 9 o'clock 35 11 o'clock 45 12 o'clock 50 o'clock 61 o'clock 52 10 o'clock 40 Wind, 7 miles from the south at 2 p. m. FARBEHIND THERECORD The Madison Square Cyclers Appar ently Loafing a Trifle. New York, Dec. 7. Thirteen thou sand times the six day bicycle riders in Madison Square Garden had circled the saucer shaped track at 8 o clock this morning. At that hour they al ready had a start of 140 laps on the fourteen thousand lap and they had moreover completed only a little more than half their long ride. Tricky spurts, dangerous falls down the steep inclines of the track and the frequent appearance of rolls of money sent in to the enclosure by spectators who of fered good sums as prizes to the team who would outride their competitors and gain an extra lap filled the hours from midnight until daylight today with excitement. At one of the turns Stol, riding at the top of the embankment, fell and as his wheel slid to the bottom of the track he upset Achorn and Dussol. All three mounted their wheels and went ahead again with a loss of less than half a lap. Early this morning two women who occupied a box sent $100 in to the track for the Achorn-Downey team provided these riders would gain a lap. The team failed to make the distance. Physicians who are at tending the riders say that thus far their loss in weight has been scarcely appreciable. There are still 10 teams in the race. Antics which made the great en durance test appear like a burlesque race were indulged in by the riders during the forenoon hours. Eddie Root rode around the ring with a water soaked sponge and approaching close to the rail he threw it full against the teeth of a man who was hollering tor the riders to go taster. Another rider seeing that many of the spectators were asleep about the track soon after daylight secured a syphon and awakened the slumberers by well aimed squirts of soda water. Meanwhile the pace was very slow. They were 257 miles behind the record at the eighty-second hour or tne race. ANOTHER BANK SAVED. Business Men Rally to Support and Stop a Run. York, Pa., Dec. 7. A run on the First National bank of this city was inaugurated today and up to noon hun dreds of small depositors had with drawn their savings. The run was caused by an unfounded rumor that gained circulation yesterday. An art store on the opposite side of the street had been seized by the sheriff. A pass erby remarked to a friend "that the art store across from the First National bank had failed." Someone caught the last part of the sentence and a rumor that "the First National bank has fail ed," spread rapidly. Long before the regular time for op ening today a large crowd of depositors gathered in front of the institution. Di rectors of the bank mingled in the crowd and succeeded in allaying the fears of many. All applicants were paid off promptly. Other banks of the city proffered assistance while promin ent business men made large deposits in the bank. The First National bank is one of the most prosperous banks in York. Its last statement shows re sources of $2,379,464 and deposits of $2, 287,100. It carries $50,000 in government funds. BOX FOR ROOSEVELT. It la Said to Contain Present From the Czar. New York, Dec. 7. On the North German Lloyd pier in Hoboken yes terday there lay for hours a white box about half the size of a steamer trunk canvas covered and stamped on one side with a lot of imposing red seals, bearing the Russian eagle. It came among the baggage of W. H. Brown of Plainfield, N. J., who has been in Russia with Lewis ISixon, who savs it contains a present from the emperor to President Roosevelt, a token of regard for the latter's aid in bringing about peace between Russia and Japan. When Mr. Brown made his declara tion on board ship he mentioned the box and asked that It should not be opened. This, he was told, was im possible, so it was sent in bond to the Russian embassy in vvasnington. 30 

DAYS IN JAIL. Sentence Imposed for Trying to Ex. tort Money From Armours. Chicago, Dec. 7. William McSwain and Wilbur Cole pleaded guilty today in Judge Kerstein's court to the charge of conspiracy to extort money from members of the firms of Armour & Co., and were sentenced to 30 days m jail. The men were accused ot at tempting to obtain money from Ar raour & Co. because of certain letters which they had taken from the com pany and which they claimed would be valuable to the government in the prosecution of the beef trust cases. No testimony was taken nor were the let ters offered in evidence. Temperatures of Large Cities.

Won Freedom for Ben Bugg Over Two Hundred Protests. The tearful letter of little 9-year-old Ruth Bugg won a victory today before Governor Hoch over a protest signed by 200 niembera of an Anti Horse Thief association of Crawford county. Ruth Bugg is the little sister of Ben Bugg, a Crawford county boy who was sent to the penitentiary on April 11, 190 3, for stealing a can of lard out of a smokehouse. The sentence was for five years; Governor Hoch this morn ing commuted it to three years, with "good time" off, which will give the young man his freedom about the first of the year. There seemed to be no special "pull" in favor of Ben Bugg except his little sister's letter. She said that her big brother was needed at home; that un less he could come pretty soon, their father and mother would not live to see him. "Both of them have to have the doctor," says the little girl, "and the doctor says that no medicine he can give them will do them as much good as to have Ben home again. They are almost heart broken. Please, Mr. lioke, let my brother come home, and God will bless you." The protest from the Anti-Horse Thief association is quite different. It says that the association went to a lot of trouble to catch Mr. Bugg, and that things have been more peaceful since he commenced his residence in the penitentiary. They say that it would be a great mistake to let him out any before his time limit. Bugg's record in the penitentiary is not especially brilliant; ha has lost a good many days' time for trivial of fenses. He seems to be somewhat of a humorist, judging from the charges against him. He was docked five days for "funny business in the dining room," and five days for "destroying his bread in the dining room." He also got five days for failing to shut his cell door so that the bolt would shoot into the fastenings. But War den Haskell says that Mr. Bugg's wick edness has been of a trivial character, and that it will be all right to let him out. Another commutation issued today was to John A. Arbuckle, an old sol dier, sent up from Labette county for five years for a statutory crime. Ar buckle's sentence expires in 1907, but the judge, county attorney, all the county officials, the father and mother of the girl in the case, and finally, the girl herself, all endorse his application for commutation. The sentence is commuted to three years, which will let Arbuckle out at once. He will re turn to Indiana, where his relatives live. WANTS NO PROHIBITION. New Governor of Oklahoma Formally Objects to It. Washington. Dec. 7. Cantain Frank irantz, wno recently was nominated by the president to be governor of Oklahoma territory, today issued a formal state ment objecting to the incorporation in.e measure providing statehood for Okla homa and the Indian Territory of a pro- nibition clause. He says that the major ity of the people of both territories are opposed to any attempt by congress to settle the liquor question. Many prominent people in both ter ritories," said Captain Frantz, "are in fa vor ot prohibition, but they object to con gress inserting a prohibition clause in the organic act erecting a state."
