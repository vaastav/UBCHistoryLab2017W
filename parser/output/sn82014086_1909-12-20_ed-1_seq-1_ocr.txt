Though she has thre .22 calibre pis tol wounds in her head, the girl began to improve today, and tonight her phy sicia'ns believe her recovery is quite likely. Today for the first time since she was secretly brought to the hospi tal, last Thursday,, she agreed to take food, and for the first time she mani fested interest in her probable recov ery. She had repeatedly declared that she wanted t die and have buried with her a man's handkerchief and a bunch of withered violets which she brought with her to Virginia Beach.

"I came to Virginia Beach to die because of the remoteness of the place," wrote the girl in the note she left, which also told of $25 she had with her to be used for her burial.

AUTHORITIES -FACE ANOTHER MYSTERY TWO ELDERLY SPINSTER SISTERS Found Dead Sunday in the Kitchen of Their Home One Hanging, tha . Other 'Lying or Floor. Newark, N. J., Dec. 19. Two elderly spinster sisters, Frances and Isabel Ritchie, were found dead today in the kitchen of their home here. The cause of the death is puzzling the authori ties and an autopsy will be necessary, - Position of the Bodies. Frances was found, dead on the floor, while- the body of the sister dangled from a piece of clothesline, made fast above a door leading from the dining room to the kitchen. The first indications were that Frances died from natural causes and that Isa- bel had hanged herself in a paroxysm of grief. This theory was dispelled when a small box was found in the dining room, on the cover of which had been written these words: "Fran ces hung herself at 2 1-2 Sat. Me too." Gruesome Details Came to Light This led to the belief that the two old women carried out a mutual agree ment to kill themselves, Frances hang ing herself first and her body being cut down by her sister. But further investigation brought to light much more grewsome details. Underneath her clothing and sticking in tht breast of Frances was a hatpin, buried In her body up to its black head. The pin had been driven close to the heart to a depth of about four inches. Similar wounds but of not.sach a- serious na ture were found on the other body, which leads to the belief that the sis ters may have quarreled and fought. Whether Frances deliberately hanged her sister, then killed herself with the -hatpin, or whether the sister found hanging stabbed the other, then ended her life, will perhaps never be known. The hands of the body on the floor were carefully crossed and the head rested on a sofa cushion. Possibility of Murder. There is a possibility that both were murdered, but the house shows no traces of having been entered by strangers. The women had lived alone since the death of their mother more than fifteen years ago, with a large dog as their sole companion. "Recently the dog died and since that time the women had been despondent. . Last Seen Alive on Saturday.
