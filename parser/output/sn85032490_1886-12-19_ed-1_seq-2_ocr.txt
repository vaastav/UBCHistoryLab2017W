The state lies in the immediate path of the modern and great national highways of steel. Kansas is the Interoceanie State pre-eminent, of America, considered with reference cither to the Atlantic and Pacific seas or the lakes of the north and the gulf on the south. Her position is commanding, stragetic. Born in blood, cradled in a struggle, she became the marked child of destiny. Within fifty years the two Americas will be one beneath thcSame flag the stars and stripes. Union the great plateau, lying between the Mississippi val ley and the Rocky ranges, equitable in temperature and cliEiate, healthful in ele vation, broad and attractive, will be locat ed the capital of the twin continents of the western hemisphere. The center of that plateau is Kansas, the center of Kansas is Wichita. Bli AINB AND CLE VELAND. CARD FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE. To the Editor of the Eaglo. As I am in receipt of letters from differ ent portions of the state asking for inform ation regarding the National and other live stock insurance companies based upon the supposition that I am connected in some manner therewith, I take this method of informing the public that I am not now nor have I at any time had any connection with such companies, and that no person is authori7.ed to make such statements as would lead to the belief that I am in any manner connected with any live stock in surance company. E. B. Allek, Secretary of State. JUST AS TRUE AS TRUTH. :New York Sun: Senator Plumb of Kan sas, spent a week in Kew York before the opening of congress. Mr. Plumb Is not an ideal senator in face or figure, but he car ries a very shrewd head on his shoulders. But, though 3Ir. Plumb suggests the agri culturist, he knows how to run a bank, herd cattle, take a flyer in stocks, form mining companies, build mercantile pal aces, run a newspaper, pick up type, and boss Kansas politics, lie is said by steno graphers to Lc the most rapid talker who ever sal in the i-cnatc, and he alone of all of them puts the great stenographic accom plishment of Murphy, the oilicial reporter, to its utmost test. Plumb hopes the race will be between Cleveland and Elaine ajniin. THAT MISTAKE. The Harper Graphic, after commending the Eagle's enterprise, takes our telegraph editor sorely to task f.r the figures given in the president's message showing the re duction of the national debt. 2Tow our tel egraph editor is not only a bright man, but a learned and experienced man, a gentle man who knows as well as anybody that the figures were 100 times too large when his attention was called to the mistake; but the message came not only lapidty but was put in type :is fast as fourteen men could do it, and in the hurry he failed to note the mistake, which wa3 made by the tele graph operator. The message was read by copy, but the copy being wrong the Eagle was caught. We hope this will prove a satisfactory answer to not only the Graphic but to one or two other papers which inti mated that we intentionally misrepresented President Cleveland's words. GYPSUMfoWNSHTP's" 

ACTION. The action of the people of Gypsum township in defeating the proposition to aid the Gould system in putting in or construct ing a line from Wichita dhcctly and in the shortest route southeast to the pineiic3 and coal lie'ds of Arkansas and the Indian Ter ritory, is a surpiise. So plain and practi cal was the proposition that the Eagle deemed it unnecessary to say even a word to so wide awake a people, a people w hose prosperity is so clearly linked to that of Wichita and a people v. ho know that Wichita is not only called upon to assist every lino, but had already cast its vote practical!' unanimously for that line. The man who would pretend to say that this new proposed line of Mr. Gould's would not be of the greatest possible benefit to both Gypsum and Wichita directly, and to the county very largely, ought to move be youud the influence of railroads and cities to where land commands from $1.25 to $3 per acre. There are hugs in this world, plenty of them, wb delight to force bur thens upon otheis that they may reap the a tl vantage, but there are a mighty few of that stiine in Wichita, and we hone that there are not many in Gypsum. n think ing the matter of the defeat over we can't help concluding that tlieie has been some mistake or misundorManding upon the part of our neighbors. If so it was an exceed ingly unfortunate one, it being defeated by nine vote. MUST BE OPENED. From the Pratt Count Register. A few days .spent in Wichita convinces us more strongly than ever that Colonel Murdock is right when he says "Wichita is the pride of the prairies, the peerless princess of the plains." In this wonderful, growing, spreading city, new additions are being laid out almost daily, palatial resi dences are springing up, great commercial buildings are in course of erection, colleges are being founded, and a splendid era oi prosperity is prevailing in every line of trade. Let Wichita continue to wax great. Its growth is the growth of the en tire state. willTwork TOGETHER. McPherson reaches down and takes the linnri of Wichita as a sister citv in the south. Between us there is no rivalry, as Wichita readies south and southwest, our territory lying in other directions. There is room in Kansas and the southwest for both McPherson and Wichita, and the two will work together for the B. & M. from the nortliT McPherson Freeman. AND ALE CHAFF. While Xew Yoik's Wall street was wrestling with the symptoms of a panic Kansas City's Wall street was booming with a great boom. K. C. Times. Ilere too. A Wichita bank at close of business on Tuesday night had on deposit one million, thirteen thousand, four hund red and fifty-nine dollars and twenty ceuts. If there should be found any gentleman of capital of the metropolis of western Mis souri who doubts the above asseition let him put up from one to ten thousand dollars and call for the proof. Rumors are current, according to the Paris jouials, at the Vatican, that the pope lias addressed a letter to the emperor of Austria, calling his majesty's attention to the position of the Iloly See in Italy, and to the alleged persecutions to which it is exposed.from the Italian government. The Roman Fantulla says that in this letter the pope asks the emperor's intervention, say ing that he will be compelled to quit Rome should the present state of things continue. Marsh Murdock is correctly termed the Mascot of Wichita. II is presence and push and enthusiasm have brought to the Queen of the Kansas Nile only good luck. He is a priceless jewel to that fair city, to part with which would be a dire calamity. Kingman Leader.

Not having seen anything from Andale in the Eagle, I will take the liberty to write up this young town. Earper & Black, contractors and build ers, have about completed Dr. Cornwall's new stone building on the corner of First and Main streets. John Friend has completed his costly residence oh Sevey street, which will be occupied by Dr. Marshall. Our merchants report trade booming and are daily receiving large invoices of holiday goods. And ale's energetic livery stable men are doing a rushing business. B. C. Soule, our leading coal and grain dealer, wears a broad smile over his in creasing business. Miss Mary Andover, Andale's popular milliner, has discontinued business, they saw to teach school, but Dame Rumor says that she is about to become joint man ager of a lumber yard at this place. Fur ther particulars can be had by calling at Oliver Bros.' lumber yard. Bro. Sevey, of this place, assisted by Rev. Mr. Dutcher, of Columbus, Kan., are conducting a series of protracted meet ings at the Christian church, and are meet ing with marked success, llenry Morrison, agent for the Carey Lumber company here, has taken a month's vacation to visit "his mother, who resides in Philadelphia, Pa. Mr. Albert L. McAr tliur, of Wichita, is holding down the of fice in his absence. Our genial and ever accommodating station aizent, C. M. Jackman, wears a smile of desperation and despair. Is it the engine, Charley, or is it asadremembranoc of the past? Our "little burg" was treated to some what of a romance the other day by the sudden marriage of the beautiful and ac complished daughter of our popular stock man, G. W. May berry, to Mr. Usnn Ueck witli, of this place. The drug "emporium" of Corley & Goodwin still continues in "the lead by showing Andale's people all the novelties in holiday goods, as well as drugs. Not wishing to encroach on the good will of the Eagle too much, I will remain silent until the next time. "Pelig." IhKhTIIE? i i FOR

JAMES M. HARVEY. The following, taken from the Norfolk, Va., Cornucopia, show what a former gov ernor of Kansas and also a former United States senator from this state is doing. It says: Governor Harvey, of Lynnhavcn, gave our office a pleasant call this morning, De cember 1. lie brings in fourteen bushels of his choice brand of Lynnhaven oysters, for which he finds a ready market at $2.50 per bushel in this city. These oysters are in great demand at the first-class restaurants in JNew YorKann Wasliinglon, and espe cially in demand in Washington during the session of congress. The constitution of the average congressman affiliates affec tionately With the Lynnhaven oyster. This is the tempting bait that caught Gov ernor Harvey, while representing the state of Kansas in congress a few years ago. Then he took his Lynnhavens at the res taurant at fifty cents the half dozen, on the half shell. Now he strolls down to the beautiful Lynnhaven coves on his farm, by winding, romantic footpaths, amid the waving aromatic pines and sweet scented rosemary, down where the myrtle grows, and the holly bushes gleam with their beautiful green leaves and their fiery red berries, and. whipping out his jack knife, leisuiely and quietly pi oceeds to get out side of a dozen such delicious oysters as are fit to set before a king."

The Washington Republican says that Wyoming would prefer a good article of gaslight to the sort of Kansas Moonlight with which "reform" has fitted her out. The time has come when the interests of the grcj.t a est demand the opening of the Indian territory. This demand is of two cliarac tixs, each of equal importance, the one in inteiest of the people who want homes and the other the interest of the peo pie who are already provided vx homes, but u ho desire that the high v. ays of com merce be opened up that they may pros per, liotli of these demands are of national importance, the one coming from the honulos of every section and the other coiuinj from a section upon whose pros perity the entire, nation greatly depends, Th United States congress, without icgard to party, recognizing these demands, and agreeing that the time had come for legis lation and executive action, passed a law directing the president to enter into negotia tions with the Indians that an equitable un-1 derstanding might be had. 3Ir being a man who was never so far west even as the middle states, and not understanding the necessity of oleiiir the action of congress, followed out the bent of his own inclination and teachings an I li h so far refused to take any respon sive step to cither the demands of civiliza tion or of its !av,-uakmr power.

Rev.

And I feel that it is better in this land than it is in any other.

Some time ago Commissioner Spark iued an order that in proving up entries the witnesses should be subjected to cross examination. He issued the order to take ellcct at once. From twenty to thirty days elapsed before copies reached the western land offices. The effect was to undo all the proof, of entrie tiled from the time of the oiderV issue in Washington to the date of its reception at the land oilices. At the WaKicny office there were 300 entries which had to be pioved over, and at the Garden Ciu office a like number. In each case, because of what was virtually a retro active ouler, the settler had to produce his witnesses and readvertise his proof. Each settler was thus put to an additional and unnecessary e.pejse of $20 to $r0. The working of the order in the Kanis offices wa only illustrative of its general opera tion all ovtr the West.
