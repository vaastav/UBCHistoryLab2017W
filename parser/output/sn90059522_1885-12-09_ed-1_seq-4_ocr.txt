There was not a large business done in stocks yesterday but a check was placed upon the decline of the previous day. It seems that the death of Mr. Vanderbilt was not known on the street till after the board had closed. Several of the active stocks declined, but finally they recovered their losses and closed strong. Chicago wheat , closed %c above the opening and %c above the close of the day before. In St. Paul it was 2c higher. In Minneapolis it was stronger and a shade higher, and the same may bo said of Duluth. NUB OF THE NEWS. The Salt Lake city trouble has quieted down.

As a friend of your ad ministration we give you these pointers for your own benefit, Mr. President. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The president's message is cotnprehen - sive enough. Nothing within range of na tional possibility has been omitted. Its prolixity and the unwarranted space de voted to a discussion of foreign matters are the most legitimate features for adverse criticism. In other respects it is a practical discussion of questions pertaining to the ! welfare of the nation. In some of his opin j ions the president may not have touched the popular chord, yet it will be conceded that he has presented his points clearly and without attempt at evasion. He is no ; straddler and makes no effort to glaze over I any proposition discussed in the mes ! sage. The document is remarkable for ■ its conservatism and will do a > great deal to confirm the confidence which the people of the country have re posed in him as an honest, clear-headed ex ecutive, who will administer the government upon sound business principals. lie pro ! poses an Indian policy which will commend itself to the wisdom of congress. His views in regard to public land grants are in sym pathy with public sentiment. His tariff j recommendations are brief but pointed. He disposes of the whole subject in very few sentences, and yet does it with such clear j ness and force as to impress his opinions upon the public mind. It is perhaps with regard to silver coinage that his rec ommendations will meet with the most an tagonism from congress. His opponents, however, will be forced to admit that the president knows how to wield sledge-ham mer blows in argument, and that he has made the strongest points in favor of sus pending silver coinage that could be made. Taking it altogether the message compares favorably with those which have come from the hands of his predecessors in office. While it is not remarkable for brilliancy it is full of that good, common sense which the American people love to see displayed in high official life. 

DEATH OF MR. VANDERBIL.T. Death is no respecter of persons. He strikes down the king as he does the peasant. His shadow falls across the threshold of the millionaire as well as the humble abode of the poor. Money cannot purchase amnesty of the King of Terrors. He is the great communist who brings all upon a level. The man who yesterday con i trolled the stock markets of a continent. I and was the possessor of a fortune larger than that of earth's greatest monarchs, to day has only a claim upon the narrow strip of earth which is to be his tomb. The pauper who is carried out to-day from the almshouse and buried in the potter's field is as rich in earthly possessions as the man who yesterday was the millionaire prince of America. And when we come to realize this truth we wonder why it is that men will grasp and strive for that which brings them nothing in the end except premature blight. William H. Vandebilt was famous for his wealth. The inheritor of a large fortune from his father, the late Commodore Vandebbilt, he had displayed remarkable business capacity in the management of his vast fortune. It requires extraordinary ability to manage successfully such a fortune as William H. Vandeebilt inherited. Mr. Vanderbilt not only preserved intact the fortune which was given to him, but he added to it. He wa3 successful beyond all of the great financiers of this country in money-making. His immense estate is the monument to his business capacity. Mr. Vandekbilt was a modest man and made no effort at vulgar display. He was con tent to remain at home and quietly look after his investments, and did not go off to Europe, as some of our mushroom million aires did, to parade his wealth in the sight of royalty. He was a charitable man, and in his charities did not seek the applause of men. His benefactions were dispensed with his characteristic humility. The uni versity at Nashville, which was founded by his father, was the recipient of many favors at the hand of the son, to which no publicity was given. It is known that Mr. Vanderbilt dispensed many of his charities through the agency of his friend, the Rev. Dr. Deems of the Church of the Strangers, and they were often bestowed with so much secrecy that even the recipients of his benefits never knew the source from which they came. And yet, with all his wealth and generosity of heart, it must be admitted that it is an abnormal and unhealthy condition of affairs in a republic which permits the accumula tion of such princely fortunes within the span of one life-time. It is no reflection upon Mr. Vanderbilt that he availed himself of the opportunity presented to him to acquire marvelous wealth, but it is a stain upon the institutions of any country that in the oneration of the various enterprises in which he was en gaged that he was enabled to make ten times more than the hundreds and thou sands of people combined who were en gaged, either directly or indirectly, in oper ating the same enterprises. It would not be proper to say that Mr. Vandeebilt's death will be a violent shock to the financial interests of the coun try, and yet there are so many enterprises of great importance so dependent on his active management that there is cause for apprehension. If there is any one to suc ceed him in the management of his vast estate with the same ability that he pos sessed there will be no disturbance in finan cial circles. In the event that there is no one capable of taking up the work which has so suddenly dropped from his hands, there is no telling what complications may follow. In this particular we have another illustration of the danger of such immense fortunes being accumulated in the hands of one person. JOBS W. DANIELi. The election of John W. Daniel to succeed Mauo.xe in the senate of the United States will not only be a notable epoch in the political history of the com monwealth of Virginia, but will be the in auguration of a new era in Southern poli tics. It is the triumph of new blood over the old. It means that the old conditions have passed away and that the new South iis asserting supremacy. The election of Uixua over li arbour signifies that! Virginia lias divested herself of the tradi tions of the past. With her back to the past and her faca to the front Virginia is keeping step with the onward march of modern progress, and under new leadership | ! proposes to achieve for herself a new glory | equal in its refulgence to that which crowned her in the ancient days. In honoring John* Warwick Daniel with a seat in the United States senate Virginia has honored herself. He comes ; from honored lineage, yet does not stand I for fame on his forefathers' feet. His own i merit is his badge of distinction. By his | own energies and with his own gen ius he has carved out for him self a rauk of distinction enjoyed by no I other American of his age. He has hardly • reached the meridian of life, and yet he | will enter the United States senate the peer jof any man in it. His is a master spirit, | which will assert its superiority in any place and under every circumstance. Nature has impressed upon his feat ; ores the seal of greatness. His | genius is read in the clear-cut lines i of his classical face. His intellectual power I shines in the brilliancy of his sparkling eyes. [ His manner is that of elegance devoid of , THE : ST. PAUL DAILY GLOJ3J& WJfiiJJNJUSDAr MOUNTED. DECEMBER 9,' 133 a— xjurf JTAJ3TIB. art and dignity that's lost in ease. His speech possesses the magical art of elo quence in a rare degree. In all the ele ments of perfect oratory it is doubtful whether young Daniel has an equal iv this country. His talk is that "s weet ex tract of speech which holds the ear In bliss ful slavery." Nature has made him a leader of men. It is fortunate for the South that a man of John Daniel's mould has been brought to the front at this crisis. More than that, it is fortunate for the nation that a young leader of such broad and comprehensive statesmanship and generous patriotism has been pushed forward as the representative of a section at a time when that section is being made the victim of calumny. Mr. Daniel belongs to the present generation, and his views are all in accord with the progressive spirit of American life. His presence in the senate will be In bright contrast with that of the man whom he succeeds. In his public career he will be the reverse of all that Mahone was. Mahone represented all that was vicious in political life. His notoriety rested on his capacity for scul duggery. Daniel is the soul and embodi ment of honor. He would scorn to rise by base methods, and would die rather than do a dishonorable act. He belongs to that rare type of American statesmen who regard personal honor as of more value than all the wealth of the world. His public record will never be stained by the corrupt streams which flow through our congres sional halls. In consideration of all these facts the election of Mr. Daniel to the senate is a matter for national congratulation. He will enter the senate as the exponent of the new South, and the eyes of the nation will rest upon him in ex pectant watchfulness, His utterances will be oracles. And his conduct and bearing will be accepted as symbolical of the new order of things which has grown up in the South since the extinction of slavery. His mistakes, if he makes any, will be fatal to his section. His success, and we feel that it is assured, will restore the South to the confidence of the country, will rehabilitate it with its former greatness and power, and will encircle his own name with a halo brighter and more to be coveted than ever gathered around that of any Southern statesman within the last quarter of a cent ury. 

GLADSTOXE-PAENELL UNIOK. It would be rather singular to find the Parnellites and the Liberals forming a union after the election is over. Queerer things may have happened, but not more unexpected. And yet it would be logical. If Gladstone finds himself with such a small majority as not to be able to rely with certainty on carrying any measure over the combined opposition of the Tories and Par nellites, the most natural thing for him to do, if he is any sort of a politician, would be to form any sort of a respectable alliance that would make him master of the situa tion. The only hope that is left to outwit the Tories is to draw from them their Irish allies. It may be said in oppo sition to a movement of this kind that both Parnell and Gladstone would com promise the principles of their respective parties. In a certain sense that would be true. Yet politics is only the science of compromise. It is only by concessions that great political movements are organized and made successful. So far as Mr. Parxell is concerned he has only one object in view. The liberation of Ireland from its present oppression is the one aim of tne Parnellites. They can afford to make concessions of everything else to secure this point. Mr. Gladstone is an old man, making the final struggle for power and reputation. He will vio late no sacred principle by conceding to the demands of the Parnellites, if thereby he secures supremacy in England. A trade of this kind in English politics would be a perfectly natural thing iv American pol itics, and as our English friends have re cently developed a remarkable disposition to adopt American political methods, it would not be such a queer thing after all to see a union between the Parnell and Gladstone forces. It must also be ap parent to Mr. Gladstone that in the event the English parliament refuses to grant home rule to Ireland there is going to be violence, and a good deal of it. 

PROTECTING THE .LABORERS. The resolution offered in council last night by Aid. Kain, relating to the wages of laborers employed on public improve ments, is one that deserves the consideration of the council. It is understood that a cer tain contractor was awarded a contract for opening some streets at a price which he cannot afford to do it for, unless he can em ploy laborers at 50 cents a day. Hence it is that the mover of the resolution proposes to protect the workingmen by an ordinance which shall provide fixed rates to be paid to laborers on public improvements. While it is to the interest of the city that these con tracts shall be let reasonably low, still it is not to the interest of the city that the bids be so low that the work can only be done at less than living wages. There would be no economy in the city paying a laborer 50 cents a day and then have to pay a dollar more to provide for his family out of the pauper fund. Nor is it to the credit of the city that the inclemency of the season and the scarcity of work should betaken advan tage of by contractors to put wages down to starvation prices. The laborer is al ways worthy of his hire, and it is the duty of the city government to see that our la boring classes are protected in this matter. What is right wrongs no man. AN UNRELIABLE PROPHET. Jay Gould says that Vanderbilt's death will not affect the stock market. It is to be hoped that Mr. Gould is right about it, but it would be much more satis factory to the country if the announcement had come from some one else. Mr. Gould carries a heavy load of stocks himself, and it has been observed that whenever he gets in an over-confident mood regarding the stock market he is generally preparing to unload. Mr. Gould's predictions of the stability of the stock market are not always reliable. We believe that he is exceptionally correct this time, but Gould's saying so will have more of a tendency to unsettle the market than Vanderbilt ? s death. This is one of the emergencies when Mr. Gould ought to have remained discreetly silent. MARITAL REFORM. A New York court has decided that a wife is responsible for the hotel bills of an impecunious husband. In delivering the opinion of the court the chief justice says : "We cannot imagine why a wife with credit cannot take her husband, who has none, to a hotel, and in order to procure board and shelter for her family arrange that she, and not the impecunious husband, shall pay the bills. If this were not so, a wife, however wealthy, might find it difficult to find rooms in a ho tel simply because her husband was unfor tunate enough to be impecunious. These observations are made simply to show that the rulings made at the trial might lead to the impracticable results suggested." This decision is possibly the beginning of a mar ital reform era. When it comes to be un derstood that the wealthy wife is liable for the tailor bills and the bar accounts of a dead beat husband, the heiress and coachman racket will come to an end. When you want to hear news you always have to go away from home to get it. That cock-and-bull story they have down at Wash ngton about a bridgA pier obstructing the navigation of the Mississippi river below. St. Paul i 9 all newsVto the St. Paul people. It must be a good ways below . St. Paul. - - Justice, it seems, is altogether a matter of price in Philadelphia. The authorities de cline to .: cause the ■' arrest of a murderer trucked to Italy because it will be too expen sive. The Philadelphia Times is right in de claring that the city of brotherly love must wake up from its village-like sleep. The Chicago Tribune may now bo assured that President Cleveland did not blow out the gas when he retired to write the message published this morning. Its character proves him to have been very wide awake to a good many things which Republicanism would have been pleased "to shut his eye." What the president lacked in Information concerning the Mississippi bridges is made up by his knowledge of foreign affairs. He ought to remember, however, that it is the United States and not the Congo states . of which he is president. Knowledge, like charity, ought to commence at home. The calibre of the man who was tendered, by a Republican majority, the second office in our government is seen in his declared inten tion to do all in his power to defeat the con firmation of Postmaster Jcdd of Chicago, because, forsooth, Logan desired Palmer retention. "Imperial C;ESAR,dead and turned to clay, may stop a hole to keep the winter's wind away." The statesman, belcved of thousands, called suddenly to his account or the million aire, in all the harmful ostentation of his limitless wealth, which the nobler end? Trade relations with Mexico are improv ing. An invoice of Baltimore oysters was recently sent through to the capital of the Southern republic. We may look for a declar ation of war, however, when the excitable Mexicans strike the first bad one. m White Antelope, the Indian who saved his drowning squaw at the cost of his own life the other day at Bismarck, furnished an example of heroic demotion which goes far towards reconciling one with the idealized braves of Fennimorb Cooper. Commissioner Sparks may have felt rather discouraged over his reformatory pro ceedings when his friends attacked him, but the feeling will doubtless disappear now that Senator Sherman considers it necessary to denounce him. The gentlemen who maintained that the relations between Cleveland and Bayard were strained will get little confirmation of their statement from the fact that the state department is accorded such prominence in the message. When one reads that intelligent men, oth erwise sane, are locating gas wells in Penn sylvania by means of a witch hazel divining rod, he naturally wonders whether this is the humbug-hating nineteenth century after all. Bismarck insists upon his right to expel Americans from the fatherland. Bismarck has evidently not beard that we recently launched a new cruiser and its armor is not made of pig iron either. The principal regret in the heartless world of speculation, of which Vanderbilt was so long, the head,, will probably be that it could not have known of his coming death in time to work the stock market. Now that the president has disposed of his message, it is probable that he will find time to look after the appointments. At any rate there will be a mighty peeping over the fence about this time. The report of the secretary of the treasury having been thoroughly covered as far as its salient points are concerned in the presi dent's message, is consequently omitted from publication. We in the West perhaps do not appreciate the necessity so vividly, but every thinking man must coincide with the president's views as to the utter inadequacy of our alleged navy. Congressman Lawler of Chicago has al ready begun to taste the sweets of statesman ship. Some admiring constituents loaded his desk with flowers at the opening of congress. Minister Pendleton is said to be dissatis fied with his position at Berlin. The intri cacies of the gehabt-gewesen-sein have proven too much for a good man. Is Col. Long merely acting as advance agent for another English exhibition with Soudan when he declares his firm conviction that Gen. Gordon is still alive? If you want to test Logan's sincerity let somebody nominate him to succeed Vander bilt. Ten to one there would be no declin ing foolishness about that. The wisest thing that congress can do is to swallow the president's message whole and then adjourn. . . Gould Have Unproved It. Philadelphia Record. Senator Logan grew a foot higher yesterday in the estimation of his fellow citizens, fle had more sense than his party, and in a mod est speech rebuked the offer of his Republican colleagues in the senate to put him in a place to which the people had refused to elect him. He might have added another foot to his stat ure and made himself the tallest candidate in his party for the presidential momination in 1888 if he had recommended the choice of a Democratic senator for president pro tem pore.

Special to the Globe. Pittsburg, Dec. 8. — It is claimed by the river coal operators that the miners of the fourth pool, with few exceptions, are working at a reduction. In the third pool seven miners and four in the second pool are in active operation. A comparison with last night dispatches will show that the strike is weakening. The superin tendent of Pine run telegraphs that the strike will soon De over there, probably ' to-morrow, and that ten strikers joined the . workmen to-day, swelling the number to CO.

MEXICAN SKIRMISH. ; The Rupture in Mexico Results In a Little Bloodshed. No Peace Yet In Servia— The English 0 Selections. Mexican Blood-Letting. Villa Dama, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, Dec. B.— Last night the state forces were reinforced by the arrival of Capt. Sarchez with fifty men from Sabinas, Col. Carlos, Zuagna with 100 men from Lampases and several small parties from the ranches. ' A night attack was expected and the entire command was kept in readiness, with sad dled horses, until daylight, when scouts brought in the news that the revolutionists were camped in force at Palo Blanco ranche, eighteen miles south. A courier from Monterey reports that at midnight fifty revolutionists marched to the public plaza in that city and fired several volleys in the air. The mayor called on Gen. Reyez, commander of the federal troops, for as sistance, which was refused. The police succeeded in arresting eight of the offend ers. After quiet was restored, Gen. lieyez detailed troops to watch the city. It is be lieved here that the Independent club was requested by the federal authorities in the city of Mexico to bring about the demonstra tion in Monterey, to be used as an excuse for proclaiming martial law at the proper time. No Peace Yet. Belgrade, Dec. 8. — King Milan has telegraphed Queen Natalie that forty-eight hours have expired in which Prince Alex ander was to have replied to the terms of peace proposed by Servia, but that no reply has been received. A Constantinople dis patch says Nadjaid Pasha has been in trusted with a special mission to Prince Alexander, the object of which is to assist in arranging peace between Servia and Bulgaria. The Vienna Neve Freie Presse professes to know that Germany has be come reconciled with Austria and Russia, and that the three powers have induced Prince Alexander to agree to the re-estab lishment of peace. Col. Milonovics. the Servian envoy, has departed from Pierot with Prince Alexander's answer to King Milan, in which he rejects the Servian peace proposals. Prince Alexander repeats his former demands and gives Servia until Thursday to accept them. E lection Returns. London, Dec. B.— The following addi tional returns of the parliamentary elections were received to-day: In Antrim, South division, -Mr. McCartney, Conservative, is elected over Mr. Barbour, Liberal, in Mayo South division, Mr. J.

An estimate of the final result of the elections gives the coalition of Tories and Parnellites a majority of 10 over the Lib erals. Apart from the Parnellites the Lib erals have a majority of 72. The Irish Conservatives, headed by Mr. Lewis, are forming an independent section, opposing any coalition with Mr. Parnell. Mr. Burt replaces Mr. Lawson as leader of the local optionists. An Open Rupture. Madrid, Dec. B.— Canovas Del Castilla, the ex-prime minister, has declared an open rupture with Premier Sagasta in conse quence of the latter's alliance with Gen. Domingnez.

Cholera has become epidemic in Brittania and committing frightful ravages, the scourge being worse at Audierne that it was at Mar seilles. MURDERED HER MOTHER. Strange Story of a Young: .Lady and Her Crime. Special to the Globe. Syracuse, N. V., Dec. — Several days aero Frank Houghton, a married man re siding near Cortland, twenty niiies south of this city, disappeared. Miss Nettie Robie, a pretty neighbor, leaving town suddenly at the same time, people concluded that the pair had eloped. Circumstances after wards occurred which strengthened this belief. It seems, while Mrs. Houghton's oldest child, a girl of 10 years, was at play near the edge of a barn belonging to the farm at their former residence, she discovered a paper on the stone foundation, and peeping under the wall discovered twenty-six letters, ap parently written to Houghton regarding the elopement. In one of these the writer says: "Frank, you are the only one who knows lam murderess." Several other expres sions of a similar character are even more emphatic, but Mrs. Houghton desires uot to have them made public. Miss Robie's mother died suddenly a short time ago. It is alleged that her mother, who was a cripple and who had strenuously objected to her daughter's many suitors, had been threatened many times by her daughter, who made the old lady's life a burden which she was not un willing to lay down. People now recall the fact that a physician was not called in to see Mrs. Robie until a few hours before her death. Houghton deserted a wife, who is a highly respected lady, and two little girls. He mortgaged Mrs. Houeh ton's property, sold all the cows owned by her and appropriated the money to his own use. . ' . BEAD!) WELL, IF NOT TRUE. Nat Goodwin and Johnny ITlorissey's Game to Fleece Saratoga Betters. From the Chicago Herald . One summer Nat Goodwin and Johnny Morrissey, a son of the pugilist congress man, were in Saratoga and both were "strapped." as they had blown in their re spective allowances. They were looking for some way in which to raise the wind, and finally they arranged a boat race be tween Riley and a local oarsman. They promised Riley a good round sum if he would fall out of his boat at the further end of the course and allow his opponent to win. Well they knew he could bear the local man in a square race. Well, the day came and it was arranged that Johnny was to sell pools and Nat bid in all pools on the local oarsman. They had counted on about one thousand spectators, but something was going on in the town and the crowd num bered 10.000. Every one wanted to bet on Riley and Nat accommodated them (on pa per), taking every "short end." Before the race Nat had bet his "wind" against about $8,000 in the pool box, which Morrissey kept under his arm. When the word wa" given Riley shot ahead like a whirlwind and the conspirators began to think that they were getting what is known in sporting circles as "the double cross." Nat was gazing at Riley through a field glass, as were many of the spectators, when to his astonishment the favorite arose in his boat and mad" a beautiful dive into ?he water. He , had forgotten that any glasses were leveled on him and , there was a cry from the '. crowd. Johnny and Nat jumped from the grand stand with, the pool box and made for the woods, with a howling mob at their heels. But they escaped to a place of safety, divided the money and left for the Adlrondacks on the first train. John Mor rissey had to make good all of the money bet, but he said: "It's worth that amount to get rid of those boys for a few weeks." A BAD M IM; Jtl\ TE\«i;\T. Serious Charges made Against' a. Mail Superintendent. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. B. Numerous affi davits, alleging irregular conduct on the part of James E. White, superintendent of the railway mail service, have been received in this city and will be filed with the post- ' master general to-morrow. John 11.

Special to the Globe. Madison, Dec. 8. — The fourteenth an nual meeting of the Wisconsin State Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry oc curred at the capitol to-day, Worthy Mas ter S. C. Carr of Milton presiding. There is a very light attendance. The report of the secretary shows a membership in the state of 3,000. The worthy master delivered his annual address this evening. In concluding he said the or der in Wisconsin is in a good healthy con dition. While some granges have made rapid strides in their membership, others have not done so well. If all would adopt the plan that La Prairie Grange No. 79 has done, it would not take long to double the membership. Their plan is this: The grange appointed two captains and they chose alternately all the members of the grange, each choosing half to aid them in their efforts. The principal FEATURES OF THEIR WORK were orations, essays, declamations, songs, etc., also reinstating dropped members and initiating new ones, each exercise counting a certain number of marks, the side that obtained the most marks to be declared the winning side. At the end of the contest the losing side gets up a supper for the whole grange. The result was that in four months' time 112 members were added to their grange, which more than doubled their membership, they having only 75 when they started. This is the result of organization and each member working to gether to accomplish an object. He hoped every grange in the state would adopt this plan or one equally as good during this coming year, and said he believed the result would be satisfactory to all. He said this order knows no North, no South, no East nor West. They find the same cordial greeting from a Patron in Maine as in Mississippi, California. Canada or Wisconsin. He advised them all to co-op erate and work with all fraternal societies for the good of all mankind. Gen. Grant a Painter. Special to the Globe. Camden, N. J., Dec. 8. — It has been generally imagined that there was only one picture in existence which was painted by Gen. Grant, and that one was in possession of the Boric family. Another production has been brought to light, belonging to W. E. Rothesay, who has been offered and who has refused to take 000 for it. The pic ture is an ordinary-looking water color landscape. Close inspection shows in the left hand corner the name "U. H. Grant." The initials stand for Ulysses Hiram Grant, his baptismal name. Mr. Rothesay got the picture from his mother, a resident of New York state, who in her childhood was a native of Ga lena. She received it from the dead gen eral herself. He painted it in 1543 while he was a cadet at West Point and presented it to her as a memento of having escorted Mrs. Rothesay on a tup East when he went to West Point. George W. Childs has been shown the picture, and, having been told its history, asserted tiiat there was no doubt that Gen. Grant painted it. Death on the Kail.

Herald of Health. Deep breathing and holding the breath are an item of importance, Persons of weak vitality find an vninterrupted succession of deep and rapid respiration so distressing that they are discouraged from persevering in the exercise. Let such persons take into the lungs as much air as they can at a breath and hold it as long as they can, they will find a grateful sense of relief in the whole abdominal region. Practice will in crease the ability to hold the breath and the capacity of the lungs. After a time the art may b« learned of packing the lungs. This is done by taking and holding the long breath and then forcing more air down the trachea by swallows of air. The operation may be described by that of a fish's mouth in water. To those who have never learned it it will be surprising to what an extent the lungs may . be packed. Caution is at first needful, but later practice will warrant large use .of the treatment. The whole thoracic and abdominal cavities will receive | immediate benefit, and continuance, with ] temperance in eating, and good air and right exe.cise, will bring welcome improve ment. ■ .
