From this it was deduced here Hindenburg had chosen the Poilus as opponents for ^iis massed armies—re inforced by numerous divisions re cently transferred from the Russian front. Capture Foe Patrol. Field Marshal Haig's battle front report gave further emphasis to the belief that Germany is seeking a weak ^pot in the western line.
