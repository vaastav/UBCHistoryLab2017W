THE OPENING OF CONGRESS AZZ INTEREST CENTERED IN THE FRESIDENI'S MESSAGE, NEWS FROM SANTIAGO. Over Two Hour Occupied In Each Branch In the Reading of the Docu ment Senntori Grew Weary Early Debate on War Question Expected In the House Dlngley Calls a Meeting of the Ways and Means Committee. "Washington, Deo. 4. The opening session of the house to-day was a spec tacular occasion, animated and bril liant. There were more than the usual number of distinguished personages in the thronged galleries, Including many representatives of foreign governments, high officials, ladies and gentlemen conspicuous in political and social life. The greetings of the members were ' most cordial and there was no outcrop ping of partisanship. In view of the gossip about the possibility of Mr. Bailey being succeeded as the leader of the minority, it is significant that the speaker named Mr. Bailey as the mi nority member of the committee to wait upon the president, an honor always bestowed urjon the recognized leader of the minority. Speaker Keed received a warm welcome from both sides, but the greatest ovation given to any member was that tendered General Wheeler of Alabama. The floral trib utes were unusually numerous. The proceedings themselves were dull, all interest centering in the reading of the president's message. For over two hours the clerk droned through the long document, but the interest of members and spectators never fagged. No ex pressions of approval or disapproval in terrupted the reading. When the senate convened to begin the closing session of the 55th congress the chamber presented a notable and beautiful appearance. By 11 o'clock the public and private galleries were filled almost to their capacity with a dis tinguished assemblage, including many ladies in brilliant attire. The reading of the message which occupied two hours and 15 minutes was received with very careful attention for an hour, but after that the senators drifted to the cloak rooms and committee rooms where they could peruse the message at their leisure in the printed slips fur nishd them. Commissioner PoiUr Gives a Farewell Luncheon Annexation Sentiment. Santiago de Cuba, Dec. 1. (Delayed in transmission) Robert P. Porter, the special commissioner of the United States to Cuba and Porto Rico, rethrn ed here yesterday from his Inspertion of the mines. He gave a farewell lunch eon to-day at the Venus cafe at which twenty-five guests were present. It was a most cosmopolitan gathering and included representatives of the army and navy, the commercial and mining industries, etc. The affair was not in tended to be anything more than a so cial gathering, but all the party tnade speeches and, although none of the sneakers absolutely declared in favor of annexation it was unquestionably apparent that twenty-one of the guests were in favor of the island being an nexed to the United States. Colonel Garcia thanked the United States for all that had been done for Cuba since April, and said he believed that Cuba would always show herself grateful. Captain Mendoza responding declared that Cuba, free of annexation, would never forget the debt she owed to the United States. President McKinley and Queen Vic toria were toatsed and every elusion to the good feeling existing between the two countries evoked much enthusiasm. General Wood arrived at Guantanamo vpstprflftv nn board the Hist. He had a long interview with Colonel Ray, the commander of the colored immune reg iment. He also had a talk with Gen eral Perez, who said that he was fast disarming the Cuban soldiers and get ting them to work and the district was gradually resuming its normal condi tion. Mr. Porter received impressions while here which caused him to cable tn Washington a request that no ac tion be taken for the present on the recommendations he had made in the proposed changes and to-day an answer was received that the matter would be held in abeyance.

TREATY NEGOTIATIONS SIX-DAY'S BICYCLE It ACE. EARLY DEBATE ON WAS, QUESTIONS Expected tn House In Connection With Deficiency Bill. Washington, Dec. 5. An early de bate on the war questions is expected In the house of representatives in con nection with the deficiency appropria tion bill which is devoted exclusively to Items of the army and navy. The bill was practically completed to-day and will be finally passed on in committee to-morrow and then presented to the house prlatlons committee said to-day , that he hoped to begin consideration of the bill on Wednesday or Thursday and to pass it by the end of the week. He hardly thought there would be any general opening up of war questions just now, although if the debate ran into such channels he thought it might as well come now as any time. GREAT STORM IN DETROIT. The City Isolated-Buffalo, N. x., ana Toronto, Ont., Suffer. Detroit, Mich., Dec' B. The greatest snow and wind storm known here has kept communication by wire from this city practically at a standstill since last night. Street car traffic has been blocked almost completely and general ly business is demoralized. Hurricane signals were displayed for the first time in the history of the lower Jake re gion. There has been a number of ac cidents and much damage to property as a result of the blizzard, but no loss of life. The storm came from the northwest. Buffalo, N. Y., Dec. 5.

After Listening to Lengthy Arguments Judge Day Told the Spaniards That "a Peace Treaty Can Contain Any thing Which the Victors Put Into It" Considerable Progress Made After This Utterance-Seven More Questions Practically Settled. Paris, Dec. 5 The joint commission was in session for over four hours to day. Much of the discussion concerned details as to the guaranteeing of the rights of Spanish citizens in the ceded colonies. The debate was occasionally energetic and the Spaniards, on emerg ing, appeared to be dejected. Secretary Ojeda of the Spanish commission when questioned after the meeting as to the progress made, answered excitedly: "I am almost mad. I cannot talk. We are making progress." The American commissioners declined to say anything further than that the progress made was satisfactory. The Spanish commissioners have re ceived authority to bind their govern ment on certain matters, but there are yet important questions on which their instructions are unsatisfactory, and it is likely that many of the details in volved in the change of sovereignty in the Spanish possessions will be left for settlement by the regular diplomatic processes, when relations between the two governments are resumed. The history of the document which will cer tify the passing of the oldest colonial power in the world and the advent of the newest was epitomized by Judge Day this evening in a single sentence: "A peace treaty can contain anything which the victors put into it." The Americans had listened for hours with their customary patience to the technicalities convoked by the Span iards with their customary shrewdness and persistency against every proposal making for the dismemberment of their empire. Darkness hf nome on, and the liveried attendants mobilized by the French authorities had placed tiny lamp at the elbow of each com' missioner. Senator Frye, whose uncon cealed contempt for diplomatic quib blings excites the astonishment of the punctilous Castilians, had stalked home. The burden of the Spanish ar guments was that matters outside the bare cession and evacuation of the con quered territories which the Americans proposed to cover- by the treaty were beyond the legitimate and customary scope of a peace treaty. Behind this bulwark Senor Montero Rios, president of the Spanish commission, fortified himself, bombarding his opponents with a supply of arguments and precedents which inspired the freely expressed ad miration of the Americans. Finally Judge Day summarized the American position in the foregoing memorable ut terance. It was given and taken in

Sunday mosn ing a heavy fall of rain began here. In the afternoon it turned to wet snow and by night the wires were laden with snow and ice and a strong gale was blowing. During the night telegraph and telephone poles fell rapidly in all directions and by morning communica tion was for a time completely cut off. At London some streets have been ren dered impassable by the debris dragged down by the falling poles. Trains on all railroads are late. The snow in country districts is piled six and seven feet high. Waller Only Man to Break a Rccord Stundlng of Ktders. New York, Dec. 5. Frank Waller of Boston is the only contestant who has broken a record up to the present in the six days' bicycle race at Madison Square Garden. He now holds the world's record for continuous riding. He left his wheel at 4:10 this afternoon, having ridden 314 miles and 8 laps in 16 hours and ten minutes without dis mounting, beating last year's record of 272 miles made by Stephane. Waller took a short rest, losing two places in the contest, Pierce, followed by Miller, passing him. At the end of the 17th hour Pierce was about five miles be hind Waller's record of last year. The record made by hourB to-day fell short by three or four miles of those made last year. Eight spills occurred to-day, but none of the riders was seriously hurt. The garden was well filled with spectators all day and until a lats hour to-night. One of the early surprises, and a great disappointment to his many admirers, was the retirement of Joe Rice of Wilkesbarre, Pa., who auit work this morning-, having found himself in no state to continue the race. Miller aroused the greatest enthusiasm this afternoon by setting a wonderful pace for many laps. Fredericks, Nawn, and Pierce were entirely outclassed for a while and only the veteran Waller was able to stick to the champion and main tain his relative position. Again and again amidst wild cries Of delight from thousands of throats Miller spurted and tried to shake the tenacious Waller, but the big fellow knew full well that with the two miles to the good, to keep up with Miller was his end of the game and he held his own. Many cheers greeted the appearance of the French champion, Fredericks, this afternoon. He has been off the track about four hours, and it was be lieved that he had quit for good. On his return, however, he publicly an nounced that he would not leave the track again for forty-eight hours, and immediately began to make the hottest nf the dav. Miller. Waller, Pierce and Nawn, however, refused to be shak en and stuck close to his heels. About the same time Lawson, the Swede, from Minneapolis, took a short rest and af terward appeared with a stomach rest the first that has been Used in the pres ent race. Hale pays little or no anen t!on to pacemakers, preferring to go his own gait, which appears to suit the re quirements of Monachan, as the stolid Frenchman keeps in the wake of the veteran from the Emerald Isle. For hours together this pair pursue the even tenor of their way. Harry Elkes, the world's hour cham pion, with a record of 34 miles 1,220 yards took a spin a little after 4 o'clock this afternoon and put life into the pack of racers. They tried to keep up with him but could not do so. Their speed was considerably increased for half a dozen laps, however. Eddie Mc Duffee of Boston came out on the track and made a dozen laps at a sprint.

ELECTION IN DERBY. session accomplished much, open questions were canvassed: being practically settled without note worthy discussion. The Americans do not regard the settlement of any ques tion as difficult. The Spanish commissioners insisted at the previous meetings that the settle ment of the status of Spaniards who re main in the colonies was a problem so closely akin to cession that it could not be logically separated from the latter, but should be considered next to cession and before such matters as coaling station and religion. They ap pealed to the Americans, having gained all the great points, to be generous on the minor ones. Accordingly the Amer icans were conciliatory to-day on the order of procedure as to the status of Spaniards remaining in the lost colo nies. The Spanish commissioners continued fighting with tooth and nail to procure every possible pecuniary and other concession. To-day Senor Montero Rios proposed that the United States should pay the expenses of shipping the pris oners of war in the Philippines to Spain. Another problem entailing long debate was the disposition to be made of the Spanish monitors of war in number of miltary posts outside of Manila, which the United States have not captured. The Spanish commission ers contended that Spain should be per mitted to ship such munitions home. The Americans replied that as the United States had conquered the Philip pines these munitions were spoils of war. The Spaniards finally waived their quibble. They appear resigned to the inevitable and now seem to realize that their best policy is to save as much from the wreck as they can on technic al points. 4.fi.ht'.a few minutes.

An unfortunate accident cut the exhib- I ition short. When McDuffee started , to follow his pacemakers some of the six days riders kept to the inside of the ; track. After he had gone about a mile a tandem which was to have picked . him up at the Fourth avenue end of the j garden slipped down the incline of the ; track and the riders were thrown in a heap. One of the pacemakers, W. H. Hicks, fell against a post and received a severe cut on the head. Miller one of the six day men ran into the tandem and was thrown from his machine. He ; was not badly hurt and quickly re- . mounted. McDuffee was knocked I against Teddy Hale's wheel and d'.s'o cated his right thumb. Pierce, who was riding In magnificent form, broke the record before 10 o'clock to-night. At (hat hour he had ridden 419 miles one lap or 350 yards better than the record made by Waller in last year's race for the same number of hours. Jimmy Michael rode a paced mile ex hibition in 2:16 to-night. The score of the leaders at 2 o'clock were: Pierce 471; Miller 470.2; Waller 465.5; Nawn 448.2; Gimm 442.7; Steven? 444.9; Lawson 427.8; Albert 425; Hale 418.7; Aaronson,402.1; Shiner,400.5; Pilk- ington 409; Turville 333.7; Julius Monachon 370.1. Unanimously Adopted hy the Aldermen -Change in Financial System of De partment of Education by Legislative Enactment is Recommended Board of Finance Recommends Appropria tionsFiremen's Petition Referred The committee dn claims, to which was referred the communication of An thony Carrrolif concerning the weighing and inspection of the coal supply pur chased by the New Haven school dis trict by the board of education from W. F. Gilbert, under contract, held a meeting yesterday afternoon and com-! pleted a report which was submitted to the aldermen last night and recom mended a radical change in that portion of the city charter which refers to the finances of the department of educa tion. The testimony taken at the va rious sessions of the committee in re gard to this communication has been published in the Journal and Courier. The report of the committee, after summing up the testimony given by members and employes of the board of education at the hearines on the mat ter given by the committee, is as fol lows: Your committee finds that the com mittee on schools and school buildings did not possess the legal authority to make a final, conclusive and binding appointment of Mr. Carroll as weigher and inspector of coal, without the con sent of the board of education, express ed or implied; that such appointment as they made at their meeting on June 20, was not final, conclusive or binding, because it was not subsequently actu ally approved of, or even passively ac quiesced in by the said board and that the board of education did have and possess, and exercise the right, author ity and power to set aside and nullify such action and appointment of either or both the committees. The motives which animated and caused the board to exercise its prerogative in this par ticular case, it is beyond the province of your committee's duty to interpret; but in the light of other aspects of this case which were brought to view dur ing the hearings, your committee feel justified in calling your attention to the fact, admitted by the oldest mem bers of the board, that it has been the almost invariable practice for years to defer to the judgment and accept, with out question, the action of the commit tees in all such matters. Accordingly, your committee respect fully submit that Anthony Carroll, not having been legally appointed and quai ified as weigher and Inspector of coal, and not having actually performed any services as such, is not entitled to com pensation, and has no valid and legal claim against the city , under color of such alleged appointment. But while conceding the right of the b6'ard of education to set aside and re of DROUGHT BY MIDDLETOWN MAN. Suit Against Mercantile Co-operative Hunk of New York. New York, Dec. 5. Suit has been be gun in the United States circuit court by Caleb B. Leach, of Middletown, Conn., against the Mercantile co-operative bank of this city, its president, John W. Newbury and Charles Clag- horn, Augustus L. Chatterton, Archi bald M. Pentz, William Amphlll, George H. Amsdell, George Brown and John Frank Hemper, the directors, for an accounting. Leach in his complaint says that heistheowner of 190 shares of the stock of the bank which have a maturing value of $100,000 and for which he paid $9,500. The bank, he Bays, is a building, loan and accumulating fund association and he alleges that the president has obtained almost abso- lute control of it, and is guilty with the others of mal-feasance in office. Mr, Leach further charges that President Newbury has caused a large salary to be paid himself and that with the direc tors he has entered upon unsafe con tracts in which they are personally in terested, with the money of the bank. He claims that the by-laws have been violated in the making of leans on sec ond mortgtges and that unearned divi denda have been paid. The operating expenses, he says, are excessive, amounting to over $30,000 last year and he asesrts that the cor poration is on the verge of insolvency, the assets not being equal to the lia billtlesh The condition of the bank, he says, has been misrepresented to the stockholders by the defendants, who have organized a corporation known as "The Mercantile CO-operatlve Bank of New Jersey," to which they have di verted the money of the Mercantile Co operative bank. The complainant cites that the total earnings in 1897 were re ported by the defendants to the bank department to be $83,219 and the amount due depositors $458,320, while to the stockholders the figures given out were earnings $104,004 and amount due stock holders $1,044,801. Mr. Leach asks that an examiner be appointed to investi gate the management and officers of the bank and that the president and di rectors be restrained from paying out any money pending the hearing of the case. , .

On the contrary His Holiness is ready to co-ope. ate with the United States in restoring or Jder there. any one else wnom any commuiee might have agreed upon, your commit tee are nevertheless of the opinion that the said board is open to and deserv ing of severe censure for failure to properly safeguard the interests of the school district and the city in the mat ter of the coal contract under consid eration. In the opinion of your com mittee, the manner in which this mat ter has been treated, indicates perni cious business methods, looseness of management, an absence of system and an unfamiliarity on the part of the members of the board with the busi ness details and operations of the dis trict, that are worthy of strong criti cism and condemnation; and which, if not checked and remedied, must even tually work havoc and disaster to the interests of the district and the finances of tlie city. It was fully demonstrated that the methods of the board of education were far different from those of any private corporation or individual; and your committee are fully satisfied that no member of the board would expend ten thousand dollars in his private busi ness in so slovenly a manner and with such careless omission of proper in spection as marked the purchase of the school coal supply for this year. While your committee do not intend to charge any actual or contemplated dishonesty upon anyone in connection with this matter, they nevertheless con sider it their duty to point out how abundant is the opportunity to defraud the taxpayers under such a condition of affars, an opportunity which should not be permitted by any municipal board and which could not exist under proper management and a well-conducted business system. With regret your committe are com pelled to note that there was much in the bearing and conduct of some mem bers and employes of the board of edu cation that indicated a disposition to 'impede the investigation whether the difficulty which your committee at j times experienced in extracting Infor ! mation concerning the matters under i consideration, should be attributed to a i reluctance and disinclination to give it, or, to actual ignorance on the part of membsrs of the school department cf the affairs of which they had cnarge, or to a combination of both, is left open for ineference. But your committee did have trouble in securing the attendance and the testimony of those witnesses who were connected with the depart ment of education. At the beginning, there was evident a disposition to dis pute the authority of your committee and to evade the inquiry, which yielded only to the determination of your com mittee, as expressed by a necessary resort to the subpoena process, to per form the duty, imposed by your honor able body and for which your commit tee wan created.

Hare Is twenty years eld and Stands 6 feet 1 inch. He has finished his second year 1 on the eleven and at college. wnich we have been called upon to deal. The Considerations then ad vanced, and the exposition of the views ' therein expressed, disclosed my sense or tne extreme gravity of the situation. Setting aside, as , logically unfounded : or practically Inadmissible, the recog nition of the independence of fhihn neutral Intervention to end the war by imposing a rational- compromise Be tween the contestants, intervention in favor of one or the other party, and forcible annexation of the island. I concluded it was honestly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be. given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations of reform to ; which she had become irrevocablv committed. Within a few weeks pre viously she had announced comprehen sive plans which it was confidently as serted would be efficacious to remedy the evils so deeply affecting -our own country, so injurious to the true inter ests of the mother country as well as to those of Cuba, and so repugnant to the universal sentiment of humanity. The ensuing month brought little sign of real progress toward the paci fication of Cuba. The autonomous administrations set up in the capital and some of the principal cities ap peared not to gain the favor of the in- ' habitants, not to be able to extend their influence to the large extent of territory held by the inhabitants; while the military arm, obviously unable to cope with the still active rebellion, con tinued many of the most objectionable and offensive policies of the govern ment that had preceded it. No tan gible relief was afforded the vast num bers of unhappy reconcentradoes, de spite the reiterated protestations made in that regard and the amount appro priated by Spain to that end.
