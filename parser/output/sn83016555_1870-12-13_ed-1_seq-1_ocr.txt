The building was leased to them for a year, they paying the first month's* rent in ad vance and giving notes for the other months. They gave the firm's name as Clayton, Wil liams A Co. Having completed this, they purchased freely of furniture from Mitchell, Craig & Co.; stationery from Ellis, Dnrell and Stet son & Armstrong, which hills are mostly still unpaid. They made purchases from other houses. Clayton and Williams took rooms and board at No. 14C Carondelet street, hut it docs not appear that the "Co." had any existence. It is supposed that the names given are fictitious. As to personal appearance they were very acceptable and plausible. The establishment or store on Delta street, which runs through to Front street, apjtears never to have contained any other produce than thirty barrels of whisky. This whisky was disposed of at a trifle under market rates, to certain firms whose signatures were desired by Clayton, Williams Sc Co. The belief is. that these men obtained the signatures of John G. Ryan, Couiagere Sc Lambert, E. Burke, Karstendeik, Harmon. Vignes & Israel, and others, on receipts or checks for the liquor sold. These checks were held several days by the new firm, hut finally presented for payment, or left on deposit, for it must be remembered that the strangers had opened accounts in several hanks. They must have practiced long and well on the various signatures, as the sequel proves that the writing 1 was very perfect. This mythical firm forged checks for various amounts, which they deposited in the following named banks: Canal, Citi zens'. Louisiana State, Germania, Hibernia, America and Merchants'. The names forged were such as these rascals had obtained pos session of in small transactions. Accounts were opened in the institutions mentioned, and the bogus checks, aggregating seventy thousand dollars, deposited, the largest part last Saturday. Fraudulent checks summing it]i about twenty thousand dollars were de posited in the Louisiana State Bank, on which were drawn something like five thou sand dollars. An application for a further sum of ten thousand dollars, later in the day. was re fused, as the cashier wisely wished to have the checks certified. Mr. Dupuy, the cashier, immediately sent his courier with tLe $4068 cheek of Coinagere Sc Lambert to the Germania Ilank, on which it was drawn. It was pronounced genuine. Nev ertheless, Mr. Dupuy felt uneasy, and de cided to apply to Mr. Comagere in person. For this purpose he went to his residence, ami not finding him there, lie applied to his place of business. As soon as shown the chock Mr. Comagere pronounced it a forgery. In the meantime, the $20,000 in checks deposited with the Louisiana State Bank had all been certified. This hank, therefore, claims that it is not a loser. On the Merchants' Hank, some $10,000 in checks were drawn, hut no application for payment was made on Saturday. One cheek, however, was presented in the pri vate ofliee of the President, Mr. E. H. Reynes, on Sunday, and at once perceived to he a forgery. This put the Merchants' Bank on their guard, and all payments were therefore declined. These checks all pur port to he drawn by bank directors, aud were in consequence more readily passed. Mr. J. E. Caesard, paying teller, of tlic Gcrmani^Pank. appears to have been the first to entertain a suspicion of the new firm and their checks. At four o'clock Sat urday evening a messenger front the Louisi ana State Bank called on Mr. Cassard, and showed him a check on the Louisiana State Hank purporting to he drawn by tiie house of Comagere & Lambert, lor $1000, who kept their account with the Germania Hank. To un inquiry whether that house was good for the amount, the paying teller answered in the afiirmative. The runner then re quested to have the check certified. Mr. Cassard inquired why he wanted to have it certified, it be ; ng after business hours, and if there was anything wrong about it. On being answered in the nega tive, he certified the check in the usual man ner. Even while doing this, however, a sus picion of something wrong struck him, although not sufficiently strong to cause him to withhold the certificate. On the same evening he went to see Mr. Coma gere, and inquired of him if his firm Lad drawn such a check. Mr. Comagere an swered that they had not. and at once de clared it a forgery. Mr. Cassard, about nine o'clock on the same night, saw the paying teller of the Louisiana State Hank, and warned him that there was something wrong in the Comar. gere Sc Lambert check which lie had certi fied to. He answered that nothing could be done in the matter fintil Monday morning. The warning of Mr. Cassard was fortunate, as it prevented the cashing of this check to-day We learn further that Clayton, Williams Sc Co. deposited on Saturday, in the Louis iana Bank, several checks, purporting to be drawn by various individuals, amounting in all to over ten thousand dollars. Toward three o'clock they deposited a check on the hank for the amount of eight thousand five hundred dollars, against the checks they had deposited, and desired the teller to cer tify the same. This the teller declined to do, unless the cheeks they lind deposited v ere certified. The party who « as tryi ng the game then said lie would take.* the checks and have them certified, taking them away. He never returned, and it turned out that the same cheeks-wvwe subsequent ly deposited in other bunks. The Louisiana National Hank thus has lost nothing, owing to the vigilance of the paying teller in de clining to certify the chock drawn against the spurious deposit. All the banks mentioned suffer some losses, Hat as the managers are inclined naturally to be somewhat reticent, the ex act figure* will not transpire at present. The Louisiana National Bank is not victim ized for a dollar. The developments were made Saturday night, Sunday and yesterday morning, but the subject was not freely discussed until yesterday. Acting Police Superintendent Robinson was informed of the transactions Sunday, and at once adopted proper meas ures to arrest the rascals. His success or failure will lie apparent before our readers will eat their dinners to-day. The "store" v^ps searched, and, of course, little was found except stationery and fur niture. Three forged checks, eaeh for $5075 84, dated- December 10, signed John G. Ryan, were found. This signature is so perfect that Mr. Ryan himseli might be de ceived. These men came here unknown to any fif the houses they dealt with, and as their suc cess depended altogether on the fineness of the forgeries, no one can be blamed or called verdant in the affair. Now. when all is developed, w-sc ones can see where the sharpers might Lave been caught. Nearly all the checks bear the same date, and there are other similarities. The greatest sufferers are the Canal, America, Citizens' and Hibernia banks, and their losses, added to the others, amount to about thirty thousand dollars. The giqgar Sheds. Three of the newly erected sugar sheds on the levee, between Canal and St. Louis streets, are now in the full tide of business, although but one is thoroughly fihished, the other two not having their aprons com pleted, aud the paintiug being unfinished. These threfc are, however, full of hogsheads and barrels, with laborers busily employed in taking m aud takinghrmt. As a proof of the benefit of these sheds to the sugar trade, on Saturday, rainy as it was, as much husi' ness was transacted in the sheds as if it had been a dry day. It is expected that the fourth shed will he so far completed as to he opened for business on Monday next. Shed A. tl*e one nearest to Canal street, is now complete, with the exception of the stairs at each eml, leading to the business mart above. The whole will he completed in the course of the present week. This business mart, which is a species of gallery around the second story of shed A, is in tended as a convenient place where brokers, dealers, planters, and all others concerned, may meet-, discuss business arrangements, and make bargains. This will he the com. mon centre, where all business men in con nection with the sugar aud molasses tpade may find each other at ec.rtain hours of the day. Although this business mart, at the present time, presents one uninterrupted promenade all around the building, yet it can he divided at any time into offices suitable for the business purposes of the brokers and dealers. The length of the second story in shed A, from the bulkhead at each end in a straight line, is two hundred and eighty feet; while taking in the space behind the bulkheads would make a circumference of over six hundred, probab'y near six hun dred und forty feet. From the floor of the gallery the height i6 about fifteen feet, and the floor is over twenty-two leet in width. This gallery could be divided into about seventy-five, roomy and convenient offices, leaving a spacious corridor running all around. The place is well lighted by glass in the roof. The extreme height from the floor oi' the sugar shed bciow to the point of the roof is fifty-six leet. The four sheds, now quite or nearly com pleted, are all that will he built this year. The remaining two sheds are to he con structed next season. The full rush of busi ness at present going on will prevent the managers from completing the banquettes to surround the buildings until the close of the season. Then every adequate exertion will he made to Lave everything complete for the following season. It is to lm Loped that- the city administration will he enabled to have the streets in the neighborhood of the sheds properly paved, for at present they are in a deplorably sloshy condition, after even a moderate rain. The only defect wo notice in those sheds is that the floor is too near the level of the ground outside. An elevation of a foot higher, while it wonld enable vehicles to load and unload with equal facility, would keep the floor dry in the worst weather. We are inclined to think that.it will 1>^ found expedient to raise the floors at a future day. In every respect these sugar sheds are as perfect and complete as it is in architecture to produce. If a:.y thing is at fault, it will he that they are not extensive enough for the business that is already crowding into them to overflowing. Governor Warmoth has pardoned Allred Chittenden, who was tried before the First District Court on a charge of assault and battery on his wife, convicted and sentenced to six months' imprisonment in the Parish Prison. The prisoner was pardoned upon the representations of a petition signed by the Judge of the First District Court, the District Attorney and others. There has not lately occurred, perhaps, a case more significant of the progress of "woman's rights" than the above. For it is not many years since that such a pro ceeding as trying a man before a criminal court for such an ofiense as slightly slap ping his wile's face, and convicting him the same as if he had been "any other man," wonld have, been thought preposterous Now it is thought to he right, and so it is.

A concurrent involution adjourning from the twenty-second of December to the fourth of January, was adopted. The hill abolishing the office of Admiral immediately, and that of vice-Admiral upon the occurrence of a vacancy, passed by a two-tliirds vote. A resolution looking to revenue reforms, and the abolition of inter nal revenue, was adopted by a vote oi 164 to 6. Secretary Delano refused to allow, in ac cordance with a request of Mayor Hall, of New York, that in the new enumerations of tho census, that each deputy marshal be ac companied by a member-of the police, on tho ground that the law positively pro scribes that federal agents can only be em ployed for the requisite enumeration. 'Ihe following is the revenue resolution alluded to in the earlier report: Besolced, That the true principle of rev enue reform points to the abolition of the internal revenue system, which was created as a war measure "to provide for extraordi nary expenses, and the continuance of winch involves the employment, at the cost of millions of dollars annually, of an army ot assessors, collecters, supervisors, detec tives, and other officers, previously un known, aud requires the repeal, at the earliest day, consistent with the main tenance of the faith und credit of the gov ernment, of all stamps and other internal taxes: and that properly adjusted rates shall he retained on distilled spirits, tobacco and malt liquors, so long as the legitimate expenses of the government require the collection of any sum from internal taxes. lii the House to-day, Mr. Banks, of Massa chusetts, offered a resolution that the Presi dent be authorized to appoint a committee of five persons to negotiate a treaty with the authorities of San Domingo for the ac quisition of the territory of that govern ment, with the authority to report to the House the resultof such investigation as they may make, and the information they may obtain, and that the report of said commis sion shall be considered one of privilege. The resolution was referred to the Com mittee on Foreign Affairs, with authority to report at any time, provided five days' not ice had been previously given. The House voted Messrs. Sypher and Morey, of Louisiana, pay from the com mencement of the session. 

BORDEAUX. Recruits to the Front—Circular of Gam bctta. Bordeaux, December 10.—The people of this city are very patriotic, and arc sending large numbers of recruits to the front, and arc equipping and ilrilling more. M. Gambctta in a telegraphic circular to the Prefects of departments from the head quarters of General Chanzy, says General Chanzy continues to resist the attacks of Prince Frederick Charles, taking many prisoners, and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. From this you may judge how false are the German dispatches, which state that the army of the Loire is crushed. Gen. Chanzy, with only half that army, still resists* successfully the German ad vance. LONDON. Attack by Frederick Charles — French Hold Their Fonitions— Russian Vessels Building on the Thames—Situation of Paris—Germans Consider its Capitula tion Certain.

London, December 10.—The Pall Mall Gazette, in an ably written leader, argues against the declaration of Paris of 1856, because it may transfer the carrying trade almost entirely to the United States. Three Russian vessels are building, and one nearly completed, in Saunders ship yards on the Thames, said to he mercantile— not naval ships. It is no w considered impossible for Paris to receive assistance from the provinces. With the failure and retreats of the army of the Loiie, all hopes in that direction are lost. The Germans look upon the capitulation of the city as only a question of time, and it is announced that King William only awaits that'event before returning to Berlin. The garrison at Belfort continue a vigor ous defense, and their heroism and endur ance excites warm admiration. London, December 10.—The German ad vance on Havre has turned aside to Dieppe, which was probably occupied to-day. VERSAILLES.

[.Sunday's Dispatches.] New York, December 11.—The bank • statement is unfavorable, exhibiting a lorn of two millions of dollars in legal reserve, which reduced the excess above twenty-fivo per cent required by law to about eight and a half millions. The statement did not have any effect on stock exchange, as the public generally looked upon it as representing .artificial tinkering with the money market during the week. The cotton movement for the week was enormous, both in. receipts and exports. Receipts at all ports 152,321 hales, againST 140,647 last week, 118,699 previous week, 122.183 three weeks since. Total receipts siuce September 1, 212,545, ngainst l,00LMt same period last year. These figures BW that about one-third of- the present (Cep has been marketed thus early in the season. Exports from all parts 102,544, against 58, 380 for the corresponding week last year. Exports from all ports for expired ponion of the cotton year 62!*,371, against 403^918 last year. Stock at all ports 434,168, against 311,000 last year. Stock at interior towns 956,112, against 77,897 last year. Stock at Liver[>ooF400,000, against 319,300 last year.

Advices from the South during the week generally reported the weather favorable for picking, and rapid progress had lieen made in gatb ering. The extent of the Crop is much dis cussed, but the number of bales will depend somewhat upon the market value of tbs plant. If the present low prices continns to rule, then undoubtedly much cotton wiU be left ungathered in the fields, but, if an advance should take place, pickings will bn cleaner, anti amount of the crop correspond ing! v increased.
