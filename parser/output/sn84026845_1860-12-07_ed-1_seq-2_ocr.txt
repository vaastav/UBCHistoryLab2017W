arc both venr readable. , j Tfc. - ,~ The President's Message Um been pcetty eitessiv^y read here as elsewhere, and is j tbe 'subject -of roach discussion. Most' people are in the condition of tbe patriotic ? Wigi&iH, who remarked day before yester day, in the Senate, that the more he read tbe message tbe less be comprehended it. That part of the document relating to our present Rational troubles is not nntike the fiuaons expression in Taylor's message, that "we were at peace with all the world and tbe rest ?f mankind." Mr. Buchanan makes it appear that the secession move ment is not justifiable, and while he de nies tbe right, be endorses tbe menace of di8onton,-and promises the seceding States that the power of the Federal Government cannot be need against them. He asks: ''Has'tbe Constitution delegated to Con gress the power to coerce a State into sub mission which is attempting to withdraw, or has actually withdrawn, from the Con federacy? If answered in the affirmative, itmu*J>e on theprmciple that tin.power hat been conferred upon Cohtjre*i to declare and to mate *oar agaaat a Slate. After much serions reflection, I have arrived at the conclusion that no such power has been delegated to Congress, or to any other de partment of the Federal Government." W*r has nothing to do with it. It is a question between the State and the Fed eral Government of obedience to tbe Fed eral Laws. As is remarked by an ex change before us, "it is the duty of all individuals to obey those laws, and the State has no authority to release them from such obedience, because the Federal Constitution, and the laws made in pursu ance thereof, are expressly declared by the Constitution itself to be the supreme law of the land?"anything in the Constitu tion or Jaws of any State to the" contrary notwithstanding." The Government has precisely tbe same power to enforce every law of Congressin South Carolina, that it has to enfore the Fugitive Slave law In Massachusetts. Mr. Buchanan does not invoke the war making power in the one case?why should he in the other?" Tbe only question it seems to us is as to the policy or the wisdom of exercising tbe power of coercion. Tbe wisdom and the patriotism of the country will be divided upon this. The power may be surrendered but it cannot be denied. The Philadelphia American has a review of the message, from which we take the following: The argument which the President puts forth in regard to the right to resist a con stitutional election is sound, and liis state ment that tbe very position of the chief executive renders him conservative is also soanil'atid jnst. .Apprehensions that Mr. Lincoln will invade the rights of any sec tion are not justified by his past history, and on a mere"contingency of such danger it is most unwise.breakup tbcUniouaud to wrqck the fortunes of the south first of all. Tbe President says there is no single act of Congress or law in existence impairing, in tbe slightest degree, the rights of the South in their' peculiar property. There is no probability of. the passage of such a law, he says, and, were such a law enacted the Supreme Court), stands as a barrier strong enough to overthrow any such legislation. The act of the Legislature of Kansas, Mr. Buchanan declares, will be declared a nullity by the Supreme Court if ever test ed. Even the State laws, if any such ex ist, tending to obstruct the operation of the Fugitive Slave law, are equally harm less before the Supreme Court. Mr. Bu chanan does not presume that tbe incom ing President will violate his duty. What stronger argument can be made against tbe justice of the present position of the se cessionists than this? It is satisfactory and complete. It is the truth, and we thank Mr. Buchanan for stating it, as it was his duty to do. duced>tb' Sir iApnlp&ble ttonl/ called. Hi, nuaHy, as cosmetics Imported. ' ..' ?*? Tnu President's Message, if we may credit the Btatoments of some of the cor respondents at Washington, is not receiv ed with much favor by cither Southern or Northern members. Wo copy a paragraph or two from the correspondence of the N. Y. Herald of yesterday: Southern Senators declare the Message to be weak, vacillating, inconsistent and untrue. The Northwestern democrats may give support to some of the President's views, but the republicans oppose it in toto. Northern democratic Senators, includ ing Bigler, Bright, Gwin, and others, friends o'f the administration, regard it as Vreakand calculated to precipitate events - on the Sobthern border States. ' Senator Savis,'in conversation with a gentleman, after reading that doenment, said that Mississippi did not intend to leave until the 4th of March, but that now she would go out on the 8th of January. Mr. Iverson, of Georgia, entertains the tame views as SenatorDavis. Gov. Fltzpatrict. of 'Alabama, says, that the Message will rather precipitate action iu the cotton Statfes,'and does not believe, that anything which Congress may do can avert a d^^ptijm JoCslayAhilrevotatjSh. jjey/'divorce case at?Brdok Y., is adrawn game.

Mt letter closed yesterday after that por tion of the Message relating to the trou bles in jhe Sooth had been read and te^ fore' the other details"hacT"been finished. Aftert-carne back from mailing it. at the over.,, to theSeaate to pee yrhat were the effects , of the Presi dent's document on that body., -Senator Clingman, cf X." C., was spea'kinjf as I went in. Thi$ gentjeman.yon will have noticed, is a candidite^ ah*d "a very anxious one, too, before the jforth Carolina Legislature, now in session, for re-election. He has already received the caucns nomination of his party, (the Democrats) but tbev have resolved to wait for the issue of events in the Sonth before they go into an election. Mr. Clingman evidently feels the suspense of his position at home, and so-yesterday, in the face of universal desire, of admitted propriety, and I might say t>f decency it self, be got up and expressed his dissent from the President's views in that he (the President) hid' not met'the requisitions of the South. It was as low a partisan har angue as yon would ever hear on the stump, and I have heard ho one who heard it express himself otherwise. As soon as he. Had finished, Senator Crittenden al most sprung from bis seat and at once had the recognition of the Chair. No sooner was the venerable bnt stalwart form of the no We old Kentuckian discried'by the gai leries, than tbev rose as one'man and stooping overYach other's shoulders, they listened with bated breath for the scathing rebuke which they knew was coining. And they were uot disappointed either: forit did come. Senator Crittenden said he had heard scarcely one word fe'l from tbelipsof the North Carolina Senator which he could commend, and he hoped that the bad ex ample which he had set would not be fol lowed -by any other Senator. It was with the greatest difficulty that a perfect out break of applanse all roond the galleries could be suppressed. The eye3 of most every man and woman in all the spacious galleries, looked a "God bless the old pat riot." One man, sitting near me, spoke out, and said that he did not believe that tha officers of the Senate ougbt to be al lowed to restrain the enthusiasm of the people. In concluding his few and point ed remarks, Senator Crittenden turned round and, looking witheringly in the face of Clingman, said : "Sir, shall this proud government of ours?tbe noblest ever devised?which was the glory of our fath ers, become the shame and condemnation of U3, their unworthy descendants ?"? ?Wlieri'Mr. Crittenden sat down, Clingman arose to say something in extenuation and qualification of his remarks, but the Sen ate was in no temper to listen to him fur ther, and Hale, of Kew Hampshire, moved an adjournment, which was unanimously carried. Coming back to the House, I find all bands going it on a motion to refer so much of the message as related to the state of tbe country, to a special commit tee of one from each State, that one to be chosen by his delegation. Ashley, from the Toledo district, Ohio, to his disparage ment he it recorded, was the first one who voted againsttbe reference. Bingham,from the ^Cadjz fiistfictj followed him. Your neighbor, Theaker, a? was;his duty, voted for the Vfife'retice. Tbe fire-eaters of the rabid sort, inrcompany, with Ashley, Bing ham, and - that school, -voted also against the reference. When Porcher Miles, of S. C., was called, he got up and verv glibely said that it made but little difference how he and his colleagues voted; his State was out of the Confederacy, and there was no use in voting. Pugh, of Ala.~ got up and said bis State was going to follow suit, and there was no use in his delegation vo ting either. Ten of his delegation got up and Rebuked him right on tbe spot, by vo tingrfor the reference. The telegraph has apprisedyon that the motion was carried by nearly a three-fourths vote. Great hope3 are entertained of this Committee, and a good deal rtore buoyancy was db scrvable among Union men, lust night, at the hotels,-although the secession feeliug was , nothing daunted'; but only the more determined. As an instance of this last, 1 may mention to you a scene that occur red at Brown's?the headquarters of the ultra cockade gentlemen. Some of-.those fiddlers jtpd .harpers that frequent places of public resort in all cities, came in and struck up the "Marsellaies," and played it well. Soon they had a crowd of about twenty "rosettes" around them, all about half drunk, and fnll of demoniac patriot ism. They made the room hideous with the vehemeut discording of their chorus. In the midst of the "finish," high above tbe rest, one fellow yelled ont, "liberty or death is a d?d hnmbugj sing a cot ton confederacy or death." At the con clusion three cheers were given for a Southern republic, the re-opening of the Slave trade, and Jeff: Davis as President. C. Iiie St. Louis Republican describes the mode of treatment adopted in q case of diptberia, at a hospital hi that. city. The complaint at first yielded readily to the, local application of a strong solution of nitrate of silvei, mild mercurial cathartics, and a blister on the nape of the'neck. After exposure, tho disease became worse, the former treatment failed of relief, and the only-hope was to open the windpipe below tbe larynx. When the opening was thade into tho wind-pipe, there was an immense gush of mucus, mixed with shreds bf the false membrane,- which was blocking up the tracha and larynx. A silver tube was at once placed in theopening, through which the-mucus and lymph continued to escape, until now his, ..recovery is placed beyond a doubt. 1 it? ?????? Jjfr. Orville J.
