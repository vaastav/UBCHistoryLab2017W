ANTA FE NEW MEXICAN, I 1 VOL. 43. SANTA FE, N. M., TUESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1906. NO. 252. NEW GALISTEO mm Contract to Walter Sharpe Bridge Company. beinforceFTonciiete Will be Material Used-J. P. Bi a,kett Tells of Con struction Work. The contract- for the const ruction of the reinforced concrete arch bridge across tlie Santa Pe River on Galls teo Street was awarded late yester day afternoon to the Walter Sharp Bridge Company, of El Dora.lo, Kan sas. According to the terms of the contract work on the new bridge will begin at once and it must be complet ed within four months, - It will cost $2,500. The proposed reinforced concrete bridge will not only be wider and more substantial than ithe wooden af fair which it will replace but it will also be a handsome structure. The present bridge lis aboul 10 feet wide while the new one will be 25 feet wide. The county commissioners had intended that the new bridge should be 2C feet wide, allowing for a 20 foot roadway and a 5 foot sidewalk, and It was so stipulated In the plans and- specifications. However, they found that by reducing the width of the sidewalk from five to four feet they could save nearly JH00. The Walter Sharp Bridge Company had agreed In Its proopsals to build the arch bridge according to the original plans and specifications for $2,788. By reducing the width of the bridge one foot the contract price was brought down to $2,500, Saved Money by Reducing Width of Bridge. J. P. Bracket! of Raton, secretary of the Walter Sharp Bridge Company, was present when the bids were op ened. As stated yesterday in the New Mexican the firm had submitted five different proiiosals. The first two were strictly in accordance with the two sets of plans and specifica tions. The other three, suggested changes in the arch design whereby the work could he done cheaper. The county commissioners decided after a discussion lasting several hours to cut off a foot from the width of the ibridge to lessen the cost rather than resort to the substiitules mentioned. Mr. Bracket t was adverse to having any alterations made In the proposals as submitted but finally concluded to take the contract for $2,500. As, already stated. the new bridge will be an arch affair of reinforced concrete. The totl length of. the bldge will he 61 feet, The maximum Inside measurement of the span will be 45 feet, with a rise fri i the 'center of 9 feet, 3 Inches. The abuttments Willi 'be eight feet wide on both sides and will go down to bedrock. Para pet walls will be erected on each side of the bridge three Jeet high which will be a precaution" against accident nnd add to the general appearance of the structure. The sidewalk will be built on the west side of the ibridge. The steel rods with which the con crete will be -reinforced will be of the , same kind as used in the construction of the' cell house In the new county jail building. The rods are corrugated and known as the Johnson patent bars. The longitudinal bars In the in tradoes will have iwelve inch centers and the rods will be three-quarters of an Inch thick. The transverse v and spandrel wall bars will have twenty four inch centers and will be half an Inch thick. It Is figured that with the single span the bridge will have a waterway of 287 feet. Structure Will Support Enormous Weight. The new bridge will be strong enough for all purposes. According to the contract it must he able to hold tip a live load of 200 pounds for every . Rquare foot of surface. Stone wing walls will he erected on the two ex posed sides of the river to 'prevent the bridge from being undermined by the washing away of the 'banks In the event of high water, The stone for the construction of the wing walls will Be taken from the abuttments of the present bridge. A thirty foot wing wall will be built on the south side, where the channel of the river was before being diverted several years ago, and the one on the north side will ibe ten -feet 1n length. The Md for this work which Is separate from the bridge contract is $5.50 per cubic yard. "The new reinforced concrete bridge will be one of the finest of Its size anywhere in the country," Mr. Bracked stated last evening In . discussing the plans wilth a 'reporter of the New Mexican. "In my opin ion It will ibe more artistic even than the two handsome stone bridges which our firm built here on Don Gaspar Avenue and College Street. The para pet walls will have a panel effect on the two sides which will serve to make it more attractive than iif only ordinary hand rail were used. Construction to Be Commenced' Within a Week. "We will begin " work on the new bridge within a week and the work will beyell advanced by the first of the year. The contract specifies that , the bridge must be turned over to the "county commissioners within four months but If the weather holds good I expect to have It finished by the first of March. I expect to return here in about a week to superintend the work of tearing down the old bridge and 'putting up the new one. "This new bridge will have more waterway than the other two bridges from the fact that it will have only one span, while the Don Gapar Ave nue bridge has two and the College Street bridge three. Santa Pe will have three of the most up-to-date bridges in the Territory when the new bridge is built across the Santa Fe River at Galisteo Street. The county commissioners are to be complimented for these bridges, and also for the new county jail building, which Is now almost ready for oc cupancy. I examined the new Jail building this morning and It is un questionably the best I have ever seen." Mt. Brackett left today for his home in Raton. He had expected to leave last evening but was detained by the signing of the contract. 43

A dispatch !o the Record-Herald from Cincinnati says: "My husband and I created Presi lont Roosevelt," said Mrs. Bellamy Storer last night to a representative if the Commercial Tribune, "Presi dent Roosevelt owes much today to VI r. Storer and myself," she continued. "It was through my influence that Vlr. Roosevelt was made assistant sec retary of the navy and It came about In this way: Mr, Storer and I went o Canton to pay President and Mrs. McKinley a visit. I told the President that I was not there to ask anything or myself but it would be a great personal favor If he would make Mr. Roosevelt assistant secretary of the .iavy. He first opposed It by saying 'hat Mr. Roosevelt was too much of a fighter, but eventually he granted my request." ' VI rs. Storer Seeks to Retract State ments. Remarkable statements were credit id to 'Mrs. Bellamy Storer in an ln ierview published here today. Among hem was a statement that she and '.ter husband had "created President Roosevelt." Mrs. Storer said today, ! hat while she had seen a newspaper woman last night, and had said some things credited to her, the report as published, gave entirely a different complexion to everything said and that undue prominence was given to a certain incident related during the Interview.

While unable to deny that such an Interview was given, she said that so incorrect and garbled a report had been published that ft did not give her views or statements, and she did not want It considered as coming from her. Beyond this she refused to discuss the matter. Mother-in-Law Troubles Among the -Roosevelts. Cincinnati, O., Dec. 11. An Insat iable desire for power and the satis faction derived from, wielding it are the two things that caused the schism between ex-Ambassador Storer and his wife and President Roosevelt. Even further than this, there has re sulted a breach between the Long worths and the Roosevelts, Mrs. Nicholas Longworth, mother of Congressman Longworth, has taken the part of Mrs. Storer, whose desire for power gave Bellamy Storer his di plomats post and also took It away from him. . Since the publication of the corre spondence between Storer and the President Mrs. Longworth and her daughter-in-law, Alice Roosevelt Long worth, are not on speaking terms. 

STORERS CREATED SPECIAL MESSAGE Sent to Congress by President Roose velt. TELLS OF REALCONDITIONS Number Recommendations Made Questions Vital to People. ''Following is the special message of President Roosevelt on Porto Rico which was read to both Houses of Congress this afternoon: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: On November 21 I visited the Island of Porto Rico, landing at Ponce, cross ing by the old Spanish road by Cayey to San Juan, and returning, next morn ing over the new American, road from Areclbo to Ponce; the scenery was wonderfully beautiful, especially among the mountains of the interior, which constitute a veritable tropic Switzerland. I could not embark at San Juan because the harbor has not been dredged out and can not receive an American battleship. I do not think this fact creditable to us as a nation, and I earnestly hope that im mediate provision will be made for dredging San Juan Harbor. I doubt whether our people as a whole realize the beauty and fertility of Porto Rico, and the progress that has been made under its admirable government, We have just cause for pride in the character of our repre sentatives who have administered the tropic Islands which came under our flag as a result of the war with Spain; and of no one of them is this mote true than of Porto Rico. It would be impossible to wish a more faithful, a more efficient and a more disinter ested public service than that now be ing rendered In the Island of Porto Rico by those in control of the insular iovernment. I stopt at a dozen towns all told, and one of the notable features In every town was the gathering of the school children. The work that has been done in Porto Rico for education has been noteworthy. The main em phasis, as is eminently wise and proper, has been put upon primary education; but in addition to this there is a normal school, an agricul tural school, three industrial and three high schools. Every effort Is being made to secure not only the benefits of elementary education to all the Porto Elcans of the next generation, but also as far as means-will permit to train them so that the industrial, agricultural and commercial opportun ities of the island can be utilized to the best possible advantage. It was evident at a glance that the teachers, both Americans and native Porto Ricans, were devoted to their work, took the grentest pride In it, and were endeavoring to train their pupils, not only in mind, but in what counts for far more than mind in citizenship, that Is, in character. Military Organization Good. I was very much struck by the ex cellent character both of the insular police and of the Porto Rican regi uent. They are both of them bodies that reflect credit upon the American administration of the Island. The In sular police are under the local Porto Rican government. The Porto Rican regiment of troops must be appro priated for by the Congress. I earn estly hope that this body will be kept permanent. There should certainly be troops in the island, and it Is wise that these troops should be themselves na tive Porto Ricans. It would be from every standpoint a mistake not to per petuate this regiment. In traversing the island even the most cursory survey leaves the be holder struck with the evident rapid growth In the culture both of the sugar cane and tobacco. The fruit in dustry Is also growing. Last year was the most prosperous year that the Isl and has ever known before or since the American occupation. The total of exports and Imports of the island was forty-five millions of dollars as against eighteen millions In 1901. This is the largest in the island's history. Prior to the American occupation the greatest . trade for any one year was that of 1896, when it reached nearly twenty-three millions of dollars. Last year, therefore, there was double the trade that there was in the most pros perous year under the Spanish regime. There were 210,273 tons of sugar ex ported last year, of the value of $14, 186,319; $3,655,163 of tobacco, and 28, 290,322 pounds of coffee of the value of $3,481,102. Unfortunately, what used to be Porto Rico's prime crop coffee has not shared this prosperity. It has never recovered from the dis aster of the hurricane, and moreover, the benefit of throwing open our mar ket to it has not compensated for the loss inflicted by the closing of the markets to It abroad. I call your at tention to the accompanying memor ial on this subject, of the Board of Trade of San Juan, and I earnestly hope that some measure wlll.be taken for the benefit of the excellent and high grade Porto Rican coffee. Coffee Interests Damaged. In addition to delegations from the Board of Trade and Chamber of Com merce of San Juan, I also received del egations from the Porto Rican Feder ation of Labor, and from the Coffee Growers' Association, s, There Is a matter to which I wish to call your , special attention, and that is the desirability of conferring full American citizenship upon the people of Porto Rico. I most earnest ly hope that this will be done. I can not see how any harm can possibly result from it, and it seems to me a matter of right and Justice to the people of Porto Rico. They are loyal, they are glad lo be under our Hag, they are making rapid progress along the path of orderly liberty. Surely we should show our appreciation of them, our pride In what they have done and our pleasure in extending recognition In what has thus been done by granting them full American citizenship. I'nder the wise administration of the present governor nnd council, marked progress has been made In the difficult mailer of granting to the people of the Island the largest meas ure of self-government Hurt can with safety be given at the present time. It would have been a very serious mis take to have gone any faster than we have already gone In this direction. The Porto Ricans have complete and absolute auionomy In all their muni cipal governments, the only power ov er I hem possessed by the Insular gov ernment being that of removing cor rupt or Incompetent municipal offi cials. This power has never been ex ercised save on the clearest proof of corruption or of Incompetence such as lo jeopardize the Interests of the people of the Island; a u if under such circumstances It has been fearlessly used to the immense benefit of the people. It Is not a power with which it would be safe, for the sake of the Island itself, to dispense at present. The lower House Is absolutely elec tive, while the upper House Is appoin tive, This scheme is working well; no Injustice of any kind results from it, and great benefit to the island, and it should certainly not be changed at this time. The machinery of the elec tions is administered entirely by 'he Porlo Rican people themselves, if. governor and council keeping only such supervision as 3s necessary in order to Insure an orderly election Any protest as to electoral frauds la settled in the courts. Here again it would not be safe to make any change 'n the present system." The elections this year were absolutely orderly, un- accompanied by any disturbance, and no protest has been made against the management of Ibe elections, al though, three contests are threatened where the majorities were very small and error was claimed, the contests, of course," to be settled In Ihe courts. In short, the governor and council are co-operating with all of the most en lightened and most patriot jc. of the people of Porto Rico In educating the citizens of the island in the principles of orderly liberty. They are providing a government based upon each citi zen's self-respect, and the mutual re spect of all citizens: that is, based upon a rigid observance of the prin ciples of justice and honesty. It has not been easy to instill into the minds of people unaccustomed to the exer cise of freedom, the two basic princi ples of our American system; the nrlnciple that the majority must rule, and the principle that the minority has rights which must not be disre garded or trampled upon. Yet real progress has been made In having these principles accepted as elemen tary, as the foundations of successful self-government. I transmit, herewith the report of Ihe governor of Porto Rico, sent to the President through the secretary o! slate. All the Insular governments should be placed in one bureau, either in the Department of War or the Depart ment of State. It is a mistake not so to arrange our handling of these is lands at Washington as to be able to take advantage of the experience gained in one, when dealing with the problems that from time to time arise in another. In conclusion let me express my ad miration for the work done by the Congress when it enacted the law un der which the Island Js now being ad ministered. After seeing the island nersonally, and after five years' ex perience in connection with its admin istration, it Is but fair to those who devised this law to say that It would he well-nigh impossible to have de vised any other which in the actual working would have accomplished bet ter results.

APPLES IKE LEAK CROP George Allen, Orchardist of Farmington Tells of Garden Spot. San Juan County promises to lie come us famous for raising sugar beets as It is now for producing tine fruits. Experiments with suar beets In that part of the country have de monstrated that they can lie grown as successfully there as in the irrigated districts of Colorado. A sugar heel raised in the county this, season weighed twenty-live and a half pounds. George Allen of Farmington, who has been a visitor for several days In Santa Fe and left last evening for Phoenix, stated yesterday that every thing had practically been settled for the erection of a sugar beet factory at Durango, Colorado. He said that, the source of its supply would come from La Platta and Montezuma coun ties In Colorado and San Juan County In New Mexico. Contracts have al ready been signed in the three coun ties guaranteeing the planting of 5,000 acres, and the officials of the company backing the enterprise do not antici pate any difficulty in having this acreage increased to 12,000. Big Sugar Factory at Durango, Colorado, "It Is proposed to build a million dollar sugar beet factory at Durango," Mr. Allen informed a reporter of the New Mexican, "A good share of the 5,000 acres which will be planted In sugar beets have been signed up in San Juan County. If this refinery meets with the anticipated success it means that within two or three years a sugar beet factory will be built at either Aztec or Farnilnglon. The sugar beet, industry will bring In a different class of farmers from what, we now have and they are needed badly. . "Tests made witii sugar beets In various parts of the county this year show a very high percentage of sac charine matter, which averages even better than they do in the heart of the sugar beet, section around Rocky Ford. They are larger in size for the most part too. Edward Foster of Aztec received a package of sugar beet seeds early in the season which he planted and it was from these that he raised one weighing twenty-five and a half pounds. Beets Will Prove a Profitable Crop in San Juan. "Mr. Mitchell of Rocky Ford, an ex pert who has been looking over the country for the past month and was largely instrumental In interesting the farmers in the sugar beet industry, is sanguine that the big white beets can be grown profitably in San Juan County, lie is of the opinion that they can be raised In some parts with only one Irrigation. He told me that the sugar beet proposition in the vicinity of Rocky Ford has developed so that It is far more profitable than raising the justly famous Rocky Ford canta loupes. He said that the Rocky Ford farmers are clearing from $40 to $70 annually per acre raising sugar beets. He is confident that there is not an acre in San Juan County that can not net at least $40. Seven years ago he bought land near Rocky Ford at $15 per acre which be planted In sugar beets and recently he refused an offer of $200 an acre for It. He said the land was worth $500 an acre to him now. "One advantage In raining sugar beets is the market. They are con tracted for by the refineries at the rate of $5 per ton. There is no slid ing scale and no inflection Is requir ed. Five dollars a ton la paid regard less of the size. The sugar beet fac tories also pay the freight whether shipped from five or fifty miles away. The Rocky Mountain sugar beets are claimed to be superior to those pro duced in Germany. It is asserted that they contain on an average of about five per cent more saccahrine matter." Mr. Allen Has Found Money in Apples. Mr. Allen is engaged in fruit rais ing and has an orchard two miles from Farmington. He makes a speci alty of apples and has a large orchard in bearing. He has prospered since locating in the valley. The country side around his place Is rapidly filling with new fruit ranches. Asked about the fruit crop this year he said: " "1 am not in a position to give any positive figures but the fruit crops this season have been the best in the history of San Juan County. This is especially true of apples. The yield has been something enormous con sidering the acreage in bearing or chards, To say nothing of home con sumption we have shipped in the neighborhood of two hundred cars of apples. One hundred car loads were shipped from Farmington. I under stand that there are considerable more apples that have not yet been market ed. The quality and size of these apples are well known. No finer grow anywhere and they 'sell readily at fancy prices. Many New Orchards Being Planted In - San Juan. "The sale of fruit trees has been very large this year in the county, and a number of new orchards will be SESSION COUNTY COMMISSIONERS Plans for Cells Approved Wooden Bridge on Guadalupe Street Ortiz Files Butcher's Bond, Severn! other matters wore passed upon yesterday afternoon at the meet ing of the Board of County Commis sioners besides awarding the contract for building a new bridge across the Rio Santa Fe. Architect 1. H, Itapp of Las Vegas, who designed the new county jail building which will soon be turned over by the .contractor, appeared be fore the board with plans and specifi cations for the steel cells, which were approved, nnd bids for them will be opened on December 2S. Three cells and a corridor will be installed in tht cell house and they will be so nr ranged as to accommodate twelve prisoners. A petition was raid bearing signa tures of a large number of citizens In precincts 1 and 17, asking that a wooden wagon bridge be built across the river on Guadalupe Street. The board consented to having this bridge built and appropriated $10 to he ap plied to I lie fund being raised for the purpose. The petitioners agreed to pay Ihe balance required for material and labor. No definite action was taken in the matter of fire Insurance on the new jail building. The commissioners are waiting to secure a new rating on the edifice, (lie former rate In their opin ion having been excessive. They con sider that the building is a good risk as it is practically fire proof and Is exposed on all four sides. Benito Sailer of Kennedy appeared before the board to show cause why the liquor license issued to him re cently should not be revoked. Being unable to do so It. was ordered an nulled and the county treasurer was ordered to refund him the money in volved. The license was recalled be cause Kennedy's population is not huge enough according to law to per mit, of a saloon. In revoking the li cense the board acted upon the advice of District Attorney R. C. Gortner. Sheriff Antonio J. Ortiz filed a butcher's bond, which was approved. Mr. Ortiz will open a meat market In this city upon the expiration of his term of office as sheriff. KANSAS EX STATE Returns Nearly $10- 000 From Per sonal Funds. OF And Did Not Receive Benefit of Monies Seeks to Clear Administration. Topeka, Kansas, Dec. 11. F. E. Grimes, ex-state treasurer, today vol untarily paid to the State of Kansas he sum of $9,381, for which amount in investigating committee some time ago held his administration respon sible. Shortage Not a Defalcation. The alleged shortage was never con sidered in the light of a defalcation n any sense of the word, and resulted from the practice that has been the rule ift the state treasurer's office for many years before and after Grimes assumed office. The investigation showed conclusively that Grimes was not benefited in any way through this practice in his administration. Paid Money Out of Personal Funds. Therefore in making the payment to the state now of the amount involved he has In an effort to clear his ad ministration assumed the responsi bility at a personal loss to himself. planted. Orders for fall delivery were quite heavy but most of the trees con tracted for from the nurseries will be coming In in the spring." Mr. Allen expects to be gone on his present trip during the remainder of the winter. He is accompanied by his wife and two children. From Phoenix he and his family may take a trip to the Gulf of Mexico before returning to their home near Farm ington. 25,000 MEN GO ON

This Is an historic day in Km nee. The si niggle which iiegan In 1SS0 with the banishment of the Jesuits ended today with a legal rupture of the bond which for practic ally a thousand years had united the church and stale. The law of isst concerning public Catholic worship, except under schismatic organization. omorrow becomes illegal. Touching Scenes in the Churches. The .scenes in some of the church es were extremely touching. Not in years has there been such an attend ance at mass. The number of women was especially large and was note worthy as an indication of the re ligions indifference of the male popu lation. Although seven-eighths of tlie inhabitants of i lie city are nomi nally Catholics in no part of tlie city were tlie churches crowded. Even at .Voire Datne, where solemn high muss was celebrated, the edifice was only half filled. Tlie officiating clergy read the regular offices without re ferring to the illegal status tomor row. Women Wept As They Prayed. Nevertheless the depression of the Catholics was manifested and many women were moved to tears as they knelt in the churches. On the eve of the struggle it is becoming evident that both the government officials and the higher ecclesiastics are resisting the advice of the intemperate. The minister of public worship, Briand, an nounces that the government "cannot be driven Into the trap of closing the churches," and Cardinal Richard, archbishop of Paris has strongly cen sured the placarding of appeals to the clergy to make violent, resistance to tlie officers. "No violence Is wanted," he says, "but. only passive resistance to an unjust law, after exhausting all protests at every step." Theological Students Must Enter Army, War Minister Picquart has ordered the recruiting officers to require all ecclesiastic students to present their certificates tomorrow.
