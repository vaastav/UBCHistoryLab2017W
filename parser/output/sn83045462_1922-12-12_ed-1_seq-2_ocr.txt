DELEGATES OUSTED! ! I i Conference for Progressive Political Action Brands Them "Un-American." I ! By the Associated Press. CLEVELAND. December 12 ?The! first business before this morning's session of the conference for progressive political action was the report of the committee on credentials, which decided that "since the workers' party of America was not in harmony with the principles of the conference their representatives be not seated." The report was adopted. The matter had been referred back to the credentials committee late yesterday for further consideration. The question of seating representatives of the workers' party of America precipitated a heated and prolonged discussion at yesterday afternoon's session. Deaeaneed by Keating. Edward Keating of Washington, former representative from Colorado, took the floor and declared "The workers' party has no place where honest trade unions are represented and It was brazen effrontery to present credentials. "The workers' party Is un-American and anti-labor." declared Mr. Keating. "This convention stands for the flag and Constitution and the reason we are, going to kick the rvyrvKiiuiiivcs vi me wwracis parv>' out la because they do not stand for the flag." The statement was interrupted by cheers and boos from the floor. "The workers" party is out to destroy and disrupt labor organisations." Mr. Keating continued. "It's officers are managed by the employers* interests. "Its leaders know they receive money from this source to come Into labor's ranks and disrupt labor organisations and I do not believe that their credentials should even be considered by the committee." Third Party Isaac. It is understood that the .question or , the formation of a third party will come before the conference today with the expected introduction of a resolution fa rortng such a movement by the farmeriabor party. Seymour Stedman of Chicago (aid last night that socialist delegates favored a third party. Morris HiUqult of New York refused to comment on the subject. Socialist delegates said they would -watch the progress of the farmer-labor resolution, and in the event of-Its defeat would offer one asking the conference to put a presidential and vice presidential candidate In the field In 1934 and to call a meeting at a future date for that purpose.

Damage la Emphasised. The major laid emphasis upon the damage done the streets by the operation of a truck on worn-out tires or on the bare rim. Several speakers at the conference referred to the possibilities of a more general use of trailers on trucks in future. MaJ. Besson added the comment that If large trailers come Into general use they probaoly would have to be restricted from crowded thoroughfares. such as F street. MaJ. Besson said he would not be in favor Of eliminating large trucks for the reason that such a rule would necessitate more smaller trucks, thereby adding to the complexity of the traffic problem. The Commissioners for several years have referred in their annual reports to the advisability of restricting the loads on motor trucks, but this la the qiot uiuo ucumic o ISJJO aiuu? ins[ line have been taken.

Army officials express disappointment at results of the recent examinations for appointments of second lieutenants in the Army, which were opened generally to all qualified young men in the country. Approximately 300 candidates took the examination and their papers are being marked by a board of officers at West Point Military Academy. Judging from past experience. It Is rainnlitad that about ?0 ner cent nf the candidates will audiry. In that event there will still remain about 300 vacancies In the grade of second lieutenant to be tilled otherwise. Last year when a similar examination was held the problem was to till 3.500 vacancies in the grade of second lieutenant. An active and vigorous campaign was made and 1/420 bona ftde candidates presented themselves, but of that number only 245 Aallfled for appointment. It Is on that basis that It is predicted that not more than half of the candidates whoso papers are now under consideration will bo found to meet the 1 requirements. 1 'NATIONS REAPING FRUITSOFLEAGUE" IHunralac of I nnrlnn Kloof.

Rafael O A Reparations Tai On Doorstep BY IJAVID LAWRENCE. I The reparation problem, which for four years has kept Europe in a atate i of apprehension, ha* b**n deposited for settlement on ths doorstep of the White House. The deadlock in the conference of premiers at London with the decision to have another conference In January means that Europe still hopes the United States will lend a helping voice. If not a hand, in bringing the nations together on a workable program. Two Found Inseparable. Try as the American government may under this administration as under the preceding one, to regard the reparation question as separate and distinct from the matter of allied war debts to the United States, the pracical side of the matter reveals how inseparable the two really are. Great Britain is trying to appease French sentiment by proposing ? cancellation of British debt in exchange for an agreement on France's part to accept a lower reparation from Germany. And when that cycle of negotiation begins, it usually ends with the barrier of America's debt on the adjustment of which no authoritative word has been spoken by any one, even the funding commission appointed by act of Congress. Can Force Viewpoint. *Pho scales are evenly balanced. America can throw her weight In any direction and force her own viewpoint. Europe Is ready to listen to American proposals, not alone because they come from a nation detached from European controversies of a political and economic nature, but because America is a creditor nation with immense financial power. In the background also Is the land armament situation, which Is keeping Europe on edge and draining the budgets of all the powers on the continent The United Stales is still waiting for France to ratify the naval disarmament treaty. Although it is denied here that the development of Amerii"j 11 n(.i i.n- tuiL'u ph u'li./.n. ^ ... - .. vvrm?, .. ^.u.ujic Iias any relation to the delay in the French parliament in ratifying the treaties negotiated at the arms conference here a year ago, the practical effect of the delay is about the same thing.

I By the Afcwiated Preei. PORTLAND, Me., December 12.-?I Hearing in the suit for divorce j brought by Mrs. Madellna Masters ! Gron against Niels Gron, Danish diplomat. which opened December 2, was concluded late yesterday in superior court. Judge Lauren M. Sanborn reserved decision, explaining that the verdict would be delayed owing to the importance of the case and the necessity of reading the voluminous exhibits. Mrs. William S. Bouvier of New York, a daughter of Mrs. Gron by a former marriage, was to blame for *'the destruction of Mr. Gron'a private life," Attorney Frank A.

The insertion by the President in his recent message of a direct hint that America would like to see the principle of the four-power pact applied to Europe was not an accident. It had a purpose.

But that is the meaning attached to It by most of > the diplomats who have cabled their . 1 foreign offices about It.

The ambition of the Harding administration. of course, la to fulfill the pledge made for some kind of association of nations In place of the alleged supergovernment of the league of nations. The latest development is the Idea of making a five-power or six-power pact In Europe. to include the United States. Germany. Great Britain. France.

Heporte Shoe Discrepancies. The order directing the boards to reconvene on the question informs the commandants that they have not gone far enough into the question to give a full and fair report, and that their reports containing recommendations show discrepancies and lack of data. The data Introdui'ed to the aeneral board by the representative* of the men, and which the latter declared also were presented to the local boards and not given consideration, indicate that the men should have an increase in pay of fully S5 per cent over the wages paid this year. No specific time is named in the order for a return of the recommendations following reconsideration, but it Is understood that the commandants are expected to speed up the work with a view to putting in he new wage scale as soon after the first of the new year as possible. Capt. Dayton said that prompt action would be taken at the local yard. Representatives of the employes hav# been Instructed by the national organizations to get in touch with their 1 local ware boards and submit again I to them data which they had collected, and aeek to iron out the differences which resulted in the recommendations for a decrease in pay. Waves Fixed Annually. "There is a feeling among the employes that the local boards took into consideration the amount of funds allotted to each yard in fixing the wage scales, rather than the data showing that high-class mechanics on the outside were being paid more. It might be explained here that under the law the wages of employes of the navy yards and naval stations are fixed annually by local wage h#ards in each yard. They are supposed to collect data from outside firms within a radius of 150 miles from each yard, taking Into consideration the class and kind of work. It was the contention of the men befora the ceneral board that the wage boards took the wages of the lowest paid mechanics, whereas those in the naval stations are of the highest type, which fact was testified to by officers of the service.

There is a strong belief among the employes that the result of the action of the general board will bring a substantial increase, as they feel that the fact that the question was referred back to them was a reprimand for their failure to give proper and full consideration to the matter and a "tip" to recommend an increase in wages. !

RUM RESTRICTIONS MAY BELOOSENED Treasury Considering Plan to Permit More Liquor in Drug Stores. More liberal supplies of bottb-i . bond whisky may become available to druggists if the application of a delegation from the American Medical Association and the brewera of America is acted upon favorably by the Treasury. It was indicated i:i official quarters yesterday that there might be a disposition 011 the par: rtf f hfi ndmlnlcfrotinn t/> ctr*> nt f to application, inasmuch as druggists were unable to get a sufficient supply of genuine bottled-in-bond liqu<-is to supply physicians' prescriptions. The delegation, which visited Secretary Mellon personally on Saturday, it was revealed at the Treasury, presented a strong appeal for liberalize tion of the internal revenue bureau's regulation on the supply which druggists may hold. This supply should be greatly increased, they contended, it was said, because throughout th? country physicians were unable t<? get their prescriptions filled, often on account of the fact that the druggists' limited supply allowed him under the government regulations had been exhausted. If the more liberal supply should i *? granted, it was explained, this would in no way limit the amount of liquor , not bottled in bond granted to druggists. A resolution parsed by the American Medical Association was presented :? Wrctaru M?ltr.n nntlininr tho tion of that body in the matter.

There was said to be no friction nor ugliness, "no rift" among members of the President's cabinet in regard to the great change which would be brought about; there war* said to be only disagreement. Before any proposal for enactment should be submitted to Congress, the President was said to feei, even this rii.*agreement should be wiped out. This was said to be difficult and requiring toleration and patience, with a disinterested attitude on the part of those concerned, in order that the best might be achieved for the good of the whole. Just when the matter would be sent by the President to Congress, it was not revealed. Walter Brown, chairman of the special committee on reorganisation. would meet with the President in his consideration of the problems, it is understood. PUNISPiVElDDIES IN WAR ON
