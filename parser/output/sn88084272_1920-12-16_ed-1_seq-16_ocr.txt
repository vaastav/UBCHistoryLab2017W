Call money was In ligbt demand at seven percent, but exchange was firm, the London rate mounting to the highest quotation of the week.

Tokio Torodzu of December 10, com mented: "President Wilson ays Americans should espouse the cause of right and justice, but It is curious to note that America's attitude Is becoming In creasingly contrary to this principle of late. The presidential message makes no reference whatever to the league of nations nor to Japanese questions. "It is deplorable, for the sake of Americana tftat they hould more and more be led to lose sight of justice and humanity. The Japanese question Is capable of Immediate solution If Justice Is respected. The Tokio Nlchl of December 10 commented - "President Wilson does not say a single word regarding it (the league Five Infested districts- have been of nations, in his contrresslonal mes found In the county by agents of the sage.

Like moat girls I am fond of pretty clothes and desire to look my beat. However. I am not a powder box. (I do use it spar Ingly.) Hrhflji valVInp ilnriss mv lnnrli hoar on Broadway, I have and do take note of the girls. Some of them are a sight to behoM. Their hair Is straw color, eyes black ened. Hps shaped, face rouged and white with powder human clowns. Occasionally - you see them glance and titter and laugh at some man who naturally returns the same but after the "xirls" pass ou, the true and honest opin ion of the "man" Is revealed, and In almost every instance It Is not at all complimentary. Men do not marry -these "Klrla" - they merely play with them. When they do select the Teal" girl, they tell her all about their experience with this other "type." Annan omoe said to me. "I love my little sweetheart for hr dis position, bnt rd give a million to? see her with that stuff oft her face. She does not understand, of course, that we look for make up only on a certain "type" and I am trying to bring her to see Just what I mean." M-D. Of coarse the man Is correct when he.sayx that he and the rest of the decent, clean, worth while men of the world like modesty and sweetness better than garishnesa commonness. Between prudery and indecency there Is a wide field, however, and there the dean-minded, normal human be ings find the happy medium between beauty and a caricature of the human face and fhrure. Nothing that Is chean and tinsel and tawdry nothing that Is glaringly artificial nothing that sug gests cosmetics have been used to take the nlace of sosd and water la attractive or can ever be charming. THE VANISHED 1VOTBR. Sear Miss Fairfax. About eight months ago I was going about with a young man whom I did not care for at that time. He told me hat he loved me and I believe he did. After breaking off our friendship about four months ago, I find that I now love him. I heard from a friend that he Is going out with another girL Will you please tell me how I can get him back, as I love him dearly and am too proud to call btm.up. or arrange a meeting. Stella. Ton cannot get him back unless you are willing to make some saeri- fice of your pride. Before you do that, stop and consider the situation. The other girl now enters in. Perhaps she loves the man for vhom your fickle fancy is now inclined. Perhaps he cares deeply and truly for her. Have you a right to interfere? which keeps you from expressing your love easily. What you feel Is mere Important than what you do The ypung man probablly respects you tor your reserve and Is pleasantly aware of the fact that you think of him so beautifully. Give him your sympathy and admiration truly that's a better foundation on which to build then on a basts of over- ex uberant and llghtly-expreased affection. THE BLACK SHEEP. Dear Miss Fairfax: I weald Just like to ask of you same advice. I have been the Mack sheep of our family for many years. But recently my father died, and I would like to reform. Bat I am cast aside by everyone excepting my mother. I have begged my uncles and cous ins to give no a chance. But re ceived no reply. H. C W. it dee&Bt nsatter how manv folks cast you aside stnee the one who counts Is standing by. Don't disap point her. Sfcc .wpsjld be the proudest of mortals tt the one she trusts when all else have lost faith were to dis prove their theory and prove hers. i our mower Believes in yon. That's enough to fight for.
