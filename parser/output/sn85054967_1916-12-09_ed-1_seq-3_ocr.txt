CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE BEGINS RAILWAY INQUIRY Proposed by President to Bet ter Condition of Carriers. MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM Officials of Reads Prepared to Advocate Federel Incorporation, Supervision of Securitiea and Extension of Authority of Intsretate Commerce Commission. Washington, Nov. 20. —Ten members of Congress, five Senators and five members of the House of Representa-' tives, began here today an inquiry Into the subject of public control and su pervision of railroads that may lead to the revolutionizing of the whole scheme of governmental regulation of the coun try's transportation lines. Incidentally the committee is to look into the ques tion of government ownership of rail ways, telephone and telegraph lines and express companies. The members of the committee which will conduct this Important in vestigation are Senator Newlands of Nevada, chairman; Senators Robinson of Arkansas, Underwood of Alabama, Cummins of lowa and Brandegee of Connecticut, and Representatives Ad amson of Georgia, Sims of Tennessee, Cullop of Indiana, Esch of Wisconsin anl Hamilton of Michigan. The in quiry was recommended by President Wilson in his message to Congress in December of last year. He described as its purpose to determine what could be done "for bettering the conditions under which the railroads are operated and for making them more useful serv ants of the country as a whole." Prominent Men as Witnesses. In order to obtain the views of all interests affected by the operations of the transportation lines the committee has invited prominent shippers, bank ers, representatives of commercial or ganizations, railway executives, econo mists and others to appear before them. The first to be heard are railroad commissioners of various states who began their evidence today. Their testimony is directed chiefly to oppos ing any enlargement of the federal authority over commerce that would detract from the powers now exercised by state bodies. They will be followed shortly by officials of railway labor organizations who are expected to reg ister their opposition to the increase of governmental authority over wages and conditions of labor. Chief interest in the hearings cen ters in the proposals that will be put forward by representatives of the rail roads, for it is reported that they will advocate an extension of federal au thority over rates and securities to the practical exclusion of state control of these matters. It is understood also that they will go on record *n favor of fed eral incorporation of all railroad lines. Legislative Program of Railroads. From an authoritative source is ob tained the following outline of the leg islative program which the railroads will ask the committee to consider in gymmiM. —>i«.in.niiTFn: =3Fimf.)mH I Facts Versus f I Fallacies 

FACT is a real state of things. FALLACY is an appar ently genuine but rcuUj illogical statement or argument. - i TfVAILY c~z FALLACIES reiterated by illy-informed O Prohibitionists about the effect of alcohol upon those ?' IN Or ■ \ wno use it, and in this connection it is interesting to turn ; to some scientific FACTS that were presented in a lecture -v ! I before the New York Academy of Medicine on April 6ta Jo i I last, men the phychological effects of moderate doses of ! ; -Icohol cn man, by Dr. Francis G. Benedict. The context i wi this lecture was printed as a leading article in that repre- j/ •. ; sentative publication "Science" on June 30, signed by Duncan S. Johnson of Johns Hopkins University. The "sf 'fljjp* salient point made was this: A ICOHOL in not too large doses, taken by the J v /SSjS mouth, is undoubtedly burned in the body, and in 7 FE this burning gives off heat which replaces equivalent s? E] —energy ordinarily derived from food or body substance. 5 fcEi absolutcl y demonstrated by Profc- sor At- jj?J V water and his associates with the respiration ca trimeter 0 at Wesleyan University, Middletown, Conn. Tuxa scien- rr vwfflff t^c P ro °* °* * m P° rtant ro^c that moderate doses of -*»■, yfj B *J| alcohol may play in the human energy economy finds veri- fication in the masterly, statistical studies of Armand Gautier in Paris, who has shown that there are certainly several million people who regularly receive in their daily I diet somewhat more energy in the form of alcohol than I they d* in the form of protein. What has been demon strated of the French is probably true of many others. ~ k i,» Thus we see that a psychological study of alcohol is, on - I abstract scientific grounds, essential to a complete under- l-l nJ*-~ standing of the materials regularly ingested which serve J as the sources of energy to the body." " INTERPRETATIONS of the results of alcohol upon the human system have been confusing and misleading be- s'-'?/■ ft cause of the preconceived FALLACIES of Prohibitionists J and other "dry" agitators who imparted their foolish no- Jr~ _ jraSffeu i || tions to the public. But when the scientific investigations 1 I' of medical experts come as authoritative FACT", t':2 tern- j"j ™ perate use of alcohol is shown to be beneficial. ~ = Pennsylvania State Br eivcrc 9 Association sf i=- 93 -zt its investigation: TEey wflT enJeavor to demonstrate to the commission that one of the principal defects In the pres ent system of railroad regulation is the lack of coordination resulting from the simultaneous and conflicting regu lation by the federal government and by the 4S states. They will, therefore, ask that entire governmental control of the rates and practices of interstate carriers, except purely local matters, be placed in the hands of a federal body so that interstate traffic may be regulated without reference to state lines, leaving to the state commissions jurisdiction only over local matters and local public utilities. As a part of this plan, a compulsory system of federal incorporation is to be recommended, accompanied by federal supervision of railroad stock and bond Issues. A reorganization of the Interstate Commerce Commission will be asked. In order to enable the commission prop erly to exercise its Increased powers. It is also proposed that the preparation and prosecution of cases against the railroads shall be delegated to some other agency of the government possi bly of Justice, so that the commission may devote Its ener gies to its administrative functions. With the commission thus relieved of some of its present duties and equip ped to handle its business more prompt ly, the railroads will urge that the pe riod during which the commission may now suspend proposed increases In rates be reduced from ten months to 90 days, with provision for reparation to be paid to the shippers if the ad vance shall be declared unreasonable. They will also ask that the commis sion be given the power to prescribe minimum as well as maximum rates so that in meeting complaints of dis crimination the commission may order the advance ef a rate which it consid ers too low. One of the most important recom mendations for which the railroads will ask favorable consideration is that the commission be specifically authorized to take into account in rate regulation the effect of rates upon total earnings in the light of ex penses. While the Newlands Committee is required, under the resolution creat ing it, to submit a report by January 2 next, it is not anticipated that the Committee will have come anywhere near completing its labors then. Mosquitoes Don't Like Yellow. People who wish to avoid the bite of the mosquito should wear yellow. Of all colors the mosquito is most partial to red, especially deep blood red, al though the fact has nothing to do witlj its fondness for blood. For yellow it shows the deepest aversion and shuns it on all occasions. It is said that the seeing power of the mosquito is so keen that it is susceptible to color even in the ordinary darkness of night; hence nightdresses or bed coverings of a yellow color will aid In keeping mos quitoes at a respectful distance. And So It Goes. "How is it you are always short handed at your place?" "Well, somebody Is generally sick or something. We seldom have all the clerks report." "Go on." "And when they do happen to all re port everybody thinks that's a good excuse to get a day off."—Louisville Courier-Journal. miuninnui»iiiinninimm;iiiniiiitmg
