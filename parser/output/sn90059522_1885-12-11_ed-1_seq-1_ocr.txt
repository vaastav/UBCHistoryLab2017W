Private services will De held at the house, and afterwards the funeral will take place from St. Bartholomew church. No autopsy will be made, as the coroner is perfectly satisfied that death was caused by cerebral apoplexy.

The remains will then be taken by coach and boat to New Dorp, Staten Island and pat in a vault pend ing the completion of the family mauso leum.

We, the widow and sous of Gen. Grant, have peculiar feelings of regret at the death of Mr. Vanderbilt. My father was deeply grateful to Mr. Vanderbilt not alone for his first kindness, but. for the deli cacy with which he conducted the matter Subsequently. We all felt very grateful and regret that he has died. Respect of the Hailroads. New York, Dec. 10. — The boards of directors of the following railway companies held a joint meeting at the Grand Central depot to-day at noon and adopted resolu tions of regret upon the death of Mr. Will iam H. Vanderbilt: The New York Cen tral & Hudson liiver, the New York & Harlem, the Lake Shore & Michigan South ern, the Michigan Central, the Chicago & Northwestern, the Canada Southern, Chi cago, St. Paul. Minneapolis & Omaha, New York. Chicago & St. Louis and the Cleve land, Columbus, Cincinnati tfc Indianapolis. The resolution is as follows: The sudden death of Mr. Vanderbilt, whose Influence reached over the continent, has startled the whole country. He came into possession of the largest estate over devised to a single individual and has administered the great trust with modesty, without arro gance and with generosity. He never used his riches as a means of oppression or to de stroy or injure the business of others, but it constantly Bowed into the enlargement of old and the construction and development of new works, some public in their character, which opened Dew avenues of local and national wealth and pave employment directly and in directly to thousands of people. In keeping together the combination of railways known as the Vanderbilt system he performed a work of the highest beneficence to the investors and producers of the whole country. To the employes of his railroads he was exacting in discipline and the performance of the- duty. He was merciless to negligence or bad habits in a vocation where millions of lives were de pendent upon alertness and fidelity. His many aud unostentatious charities are known only to the beneficiaries, but the Vanderbilt university, the Egyptian obelisk and the medical college in New York will remain as monuments of his public spirit. Illinois Fine Stock. Special to the Globe. Elgin, 111., Dec. 10. — John Doran of this city started for Texas to-day with a carload of tine Western cattle belonging to Dr. W. A. Pratt. Another carload will be shipped to San Mareial, X. M.. next week. Keoently larse shipments have been made by local stockmen to both Old and New Mexoo. A Spanish-speaking don from our sister Republic was here the other day for tine bred stock. This is a srowing in dustry here, audit is considered that therein lies the future of the dairy belt. The profit In the butter making is now small, but the fame of Elgin dairy uro- ducts can be cited to market hue bred cattle | to which much attention has been given of late. The statement is made that not half the butter is now being made hereabouts that was a year ago. The past year has been an unprofitable one to dairymen and many are varying their business. Much more milk is beinsr shipped to Chicago from this county. Factories with a capacity for 10.000 pounds of milk a day are getting 2.000 or 3.000 pounds, and some have had to shut down. Between low prices, fail ures and butterine the buttermakers have had much to contend with, and it is evi dent that the palmy days of the industry are past. Montreal's Health.

Sparks Has His Office Secure, and the Buckeye Senator Can't Carry Out His Threat. Mrs. Pendleton Dislikes Social Berlin and Wants to Recross the Ocean with Gentleman Georgei - President Cleveland Sends the Senate All Appointments Made Since Spring Adjournment. Certain lowa Citizens Charge the Government with. Conspiracy to Squelch Silver. { Sherman's Bad Break Special to the Globe. Washington, Dee. 10.— The morning papers contain a letter from Senator Sher man, which comes East as a special from Huron, Dak. It is a letter in which Sher man responds to the strictures of F. L. Ferris of Kedfield upon Commissioner Sparks. Sherman says the senate will give consideration to his confirmation and that he has heard of his extraordinary rulings. This is a remarkable blunder for John Sher man. Sparks was confirmed March 25 last. 

JIBS. PEXDLETOX DISSATISFIED. The Social Atmosphere of Berlin Doesn't Agree With Her. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 10. — Col. Fred Rains is owner of a German newspaper in Balti more. Col. Rains is also the United States consul general at Berlin, Germany. The official position of Col. Rains is such that he doubtless speaks by the card in an edi torial which appeared in his newspaper yesterday touching Minister Pendleton and his dissatisfaction with his present position. The editorial aforesaid says: . Mr. Pendleton, our minister, must have dis covered a hair in his butter. He is disgrun tled, and seriously contemplates a speedy re turn to the land of liberty. At first blush this resolution would appear astonishing, for his duties are light and pleasant, and gen tlemen of his persuasion and proclivities usually manage to fill up the twenty four hours of daily life to their hearts' content in a continuous round of social pleasures. Deliarhts abound and a minister is seldem overtaxed with labor and. even should anything occur to in terrupt the usual flow of good feeling, there is always ample assistance at hand. Why, therefore, our minister should be dissatisfied with his high position it is hard to under stand. It cannot certainly bo the case that in his ollieial intercourse he has MET 

WITH REBUFFS or even discourtesy on the part of the gov ernment to which he is accredited, for we know from the tenor of numerous dispatches that a few days ago, in the Schleswig matter, he was treated by the German authorities with the utmost consideration. Thus nothing could have as yet occurred that would smack at all of the troubles so recently experienced by Mr. Sargent, but, unfortunately, reading between the lines of the dispatches from abroad, it would seem that differences have occurred : originating in quite a different source. It appears to be Mrs. Pen dletou who is dissatisfied. Her position at court is not at all to her taste. Indeed this is very unpleasant, but this is hardly a matter for surprise. The American lady is a very high and dignified personage. She suddenly makes the discov ery that in other countries there are persons even more dignified and exclusive in their surrounding's than herself — aye even the Germans, whom Americans have been wont to look upon as the meekest of mankind. No wonder, therefore, that a lady accustomed to look upon herself as the pink of society at home should feel disconcerted at finding her self in Berlin in contact with thousands of women who are more dignified and exclusive than herself and who base their pretensions on the merits of their ancestors running back to the Crusaders. These scions of the great families pretend to see nothing in the hus band of Mrs. Pendleton, though he be an ex senator and politician however respectable, but that after ail he is but an ordinary coin- LABOR Or Till: SENATORS. The Day Spent in the Introduction of Bills. Washington, Dec. 10. — In the senate to-day Mr. Edmunds introduced a bill to provide for the establishment of a postal telegraph. Mr. Edmunds said it was the same bill that he had introduced at the last session of congress. He hoped the commit tee would now take the earliest opportun ity to report on it. Mr. Saulsbury said the committee on postoflices and post roads had at the last session given the subject careful attention and examination, and had reported the bill as early as was prac ticable. Mr. Edmunds disclaimed any re flection on the committee. The subject was a most important one, and needed con siderable examination. A resolution offered by Mr. Morrill was agreed to. directing the payment from the contingent fund ot the senate of the actual and necessary expenses of the senate committee appointed to attend the funeral of Gen. Grant. Mr. McPher son presented a joint resolution of the leg islature of New* Jersey, recommending a congressional inquiry into the Jitness of a portion of the territory of Alaska for the purpose of a penal colony for long term or life term convicts. Mr. Dolph introduced a bill to repeal the law of last session pro viding for the settlement of claims of offi cers and enlisted men of the army for loss of private property destroyed in the military service of the United States. This is the law to which the president calls attention in his message as '•indefinite in its terms," and as to which he says: "If it is to re main on the statute books it needs amend ment." In the discussion which followed Messrs. Cockrell, Hawley, Logan and Plumb took part, the general view being that the law was in no way ambiguous. The bill was referred to the committee on military affairs. 

OTHER BILLS. Among the bills introduced and appro priately referred were the following: By Mr. Platt — To relieve commercial trav elers from license taxes. (It makes it a mis demeanor for any officer of a state or a mu nicipal corporation to interfere in any way with a commercial traveler selling goods in a state in which he or the merchants he repre sent* is not a citizen.) By Mr. Wilson of lowa — To promote peace atnong nations. (It authorizes the president to enter into negotiations with other govern ments with a view to the formation of an in ternational tribunal for the arbitration of any difficulties that may occur among nations, and requests him to invite other nations to send delegates to a proposed international peace convention to be held in Washington at such time as he may fix, and appropriates $150,0U0 for this purpose.) By Mr. George — To establish agricultural experiment stations in connection with the agricultural colleges in the several states. By Mr. Plumb — To open to homestead set tlement certain portions of the Indian Terri tory. (This is the Oklahoma bill of the last congTess.) By Mr. Call— To investigate the issue of fraudulent land warrants and to protect soldiers and sailors of the United States from loss therefrom. (It puts the enforcement of its provisions in the hands of the secretary of the interior.) By Mr. Plumb — To make an additional article of war. (It provides that any officers serving with troops, or any soldier not on furloug-h who gambles, or any officer of the army whether or not serving with troops,also by gambling, who shall win money from an inferior officer, shall be court-martialed, and that any post-trader who permits gambling in his establishment shall have his appoint ment revoked.and makes it the duty of every commanding officer to enforce the^provisions of the act.) On motion of Mr. Allison, the senate went Into executive session, and when the doors were reopened the senate adjourned until Monday nest. * Railroad Kelinquishments. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 10. — Inquiry has been directed to the land office to be made about relinquishnients of lands by railroads for a moneyed consideration. Charges have been tiled that certain railroads employ agents to secure settlers to go upon railroad lands. The road then takes a lien of the lands and also relinquishes the first lands and sells to settlers for 52.50 per acre. Upon the discovery of specific facts claims to the lien of lands will be cancelled. NEW I'SE FOR 

CHADIPAGNE. The Sparkling 1 Wine as a Commer cial Barometer. Washington, Dec. 10. — United States Consul Frisbie, at Lyons, France, has made an interesting report to the department of state on the subject of champagne as a com mercial barometer. He says the sparkling wine has long been held as a barometer in many business circles tor measuring and determining commercial prosperity or de pression in different countries, and that Oc tober has usually been the month selected as giving the truest tests in this regard, as it is the month when nearly all countries order supplies for the approaching social and holiday season. He says that for a long time past there had been a gradually increasing de pression in the champagne made in all the countries, which readied its lowest stage in the United States during the fiscal year 1874. That year it showed a decrease of §1,867,459 as compared with the previous year. There has been a gradual improve ment in the fiscal year 1885, which shows an increase of 8254,924 over the previous year. The invoices legalized at THE LICENSE CONSULATE during the barometer month of Occober, ISSS, show shipments to the United States to the value of §343. 550, an increase of 5142.997 over the same month of 1884, and an increase of §138,093 over October, 1883. Consul Frisbie says this increase is phenom enal and indicates a degree of prosperity and promise of com mercial activity beyond the anticipation of our business men. Such, however, is not the case with European countries, where a long stagnation of business and commercial inactivity has been intensified by political questions and the fears of war. A serious strike has occurred at one of the largest woolen factories at Rheims as the result of the present depression, and a fear is ex pressed that as other firms have to reduce wages, a general strike of operatives will result. He mentions these strikes to show the bad state of business in France and adds that what is true of France is also true of other European countries. Conspiracy Charged. Washington, Dec. 10. — Various peti tions, signed by citizens of lowa, were placedCiin the petition box of the house to day, reciting that the present secretary of the treasury, the American Bankers' asso ciation and the leading newspapers of East ern cities have joined in a conspiracy to in crease the value and purchasing power of f untied debts and fixed incomes through the depreciation of general values by the de monetization of silver or a suspension of its coinage. The petitioners ask coneress to place the coinage of silver on an equality with the coinage of gold, and ask that the coin certificates be continued; that a reissue be made of one and two dollar notes, and that the public debt be liquidated as rapidly as the revenues of the government will permit. IClorison's Plan Favored. Special to the Globe. Washington. Dec. 10. — "What are the prospects of the Hennepin canal Ihis ses sion?" the Globe correspondent asked Con gressman Cannon, as be was walking: to the capitol this afternoon. "Pretty fair, I think." he said. "Those who usually push, this measure are pretty hopeful this time." '•How about the new rules in the house?" "Well, I think the house will probably adopt Mr. Morrison's plau. Most every member of the house thinks he will set on one of the committees to which Morrison proposes to send the appropriation bills, and as there is an insane idea that it enhances one's import ance to make helpmates of these appropria tion bills there will be a majority in favor of this change. I am not, and don't think it good for the country or for the party in power in the house that they should be adopted, but they will be, though." He Pruned His Message. Special to the Globe. Washington. Dec. 10. — The president told Senator Cullom to-day that he had been compelled to take a great deal of matter out of his message that had been written and put in type in order to shorten the docu ment, and he thought it was much too long as it was, but he said he wonld probably have a chance to use the rejected parts at some future time, and -would lay it care fully away for that purpose. All in a Lump, Washington, Dec. 10. — The president sent to the senate this morning for action all the nominations made by him during the recess. There were no names on the list that have not already been given in these dispatches. Discussing 1 Presidential Succession. ■Washington, Dec. 10. — The senate committee on privileges and elections to day took up and discussed the presidential succession bill, but adjourned without ac tion. The committee will meet for further conside:ation of their measure next Satur day. Washington Waifs. The closing 1 of the telephone easeshas again been postponed. At a conference of the in terior department officials held Wednesday evening additional time was granted counsel in which to file briefs. THE 

EIGHT-HOUR RULE. The Federation of Labor Refers Its Resolution for Revision. "Washington, Dec. 10.— The Federation of Labor Unions of the United States and Canada resumed its session to-day, and took up for consideration the resolution providing thai the eight-hour rule shall take effect from May 1 next. The question caused a general debate and developed a diversity of opinions as to the best methods of accomplishing the desired result. Some of the delegates favored a gradual change; some proposed a fine for working over hours; others favored reducing the wages with the hours; others urged that double pay be exacted for extra work, and others advocate a general consultation with em ployers in order to secure unite'! action. An amendment, which provided that a thorough canvass should be made in the re spective trades for the purpose of securing the co-operation of as many as possible in carrying out the resolution, was adopted. Before a final vote was taken upon the reso lution it was explained that its adoption did not compel any organization which did not feel strong enough to carry into opera tion thf> pic-ht-hnnr law to do so. The in- tention was not to force a strike, or compel organizations to do what they did not feel able to do. With this understanding it was said that all the delegates were in favor of the resolution. It was thought that the resolution in the present form did not con- vey its intention as cieariy as it snouia, and it was referred to the committee on resolutions for revision. In the evening the resolution was passed and 300 members of the local trades unions paraded the principal streets. A mass meeting was held after the parade, at which the delegates to the federation were guests. "Watts Sot tiuilty. Louisville, Ky., Dec. 10.— J. E.

DEADLY TRICHINOSIS. A Pennsylvania Family Makes a Meal of Eaw Pork and is on the Way to Eternity. Mannix, the Assignee of the Late Arch bishop Purcell, Sinks $200,000 in Stocks. The Kentucky, Texas and Italian Method* of Killing-- A Penchant for Gold Watcnes. A Tennessee Mob Catches an Ex-Con vict and Swings Him to a Con venient Tree. Dyinsr of Trichinosis. Pittsburg, Dec. 10. — Some two weeks ago the family of Frederick Hausemeyer, a well-to-do German of Tarentum, Pa., eighteen miles from this city, ate heartily of a salad of which raw pork chopped tine was one of the principal ingredients. Last Friday a week the entire family, consisting of the lather, mother, three sons and three daughters, were suddenly seized with a ter rible illness. The symptoms were all the same. A distressing diarrhoea wasthefirsr symptom. This was followed by a feeling of languor and debility and acute neuralgia pains, followed with stiffness of the joints, and the most of the patients became delir ious. The tongues of the victims became heavily coated, and so much were the symptoms like typhoid fever that Dr. McCullough, the family physician, at first thought it to be that dread disease. From the suddenness with which they had been sfrickeu down their house had been shunned by the neighbors, who feared that they were suffering from some terrible contagion. The tamily con tinued to grow worse, and yesterday Frederick, aged 20 years, died in great agony. John, the second son, is now so low that he is not expected to live through the night and the rest are at the point of death. Before Frederick's death the physician be came convinced that the disease was trichi nosis. He secured some ofQthe meat, and, with the aid of the microscope, found it alive with trichinae spirals. The meat was purchased from a farmer and was taken from one of a drove of hogs which he had raised on his own farm. Dr. McCullough says he expects another of the family to die to-night, and has no hopes that any of them will recover. Lived on Cocoanuts. New York, Dec. 10.— The effects of the recent blizzard are being told by the cap tains of incoming vessels. The schooner Relief, which arrived yesterday from Jack sonville, Fla. , had two of her sailors swept overboard and drowned. The ship Corriga, from London, yesterday landed here the crew, eighteen in number, of the Norwe gian bark Nora, which was recently aban doned in a sinking condition. The schooner E. A. Warner was twenty-four days com ing from Baroca with fruit, and was so short of provisions that the crew lived principally on cocoanuts the last four days of the voyage. From all along the north eastern coast come similar stories of wrecks and great sufferings by crews. A Trifle Peculiar. St. Jonxs, N. 8., Dec. 10.— While the east-bound freight train on the New Brans wick railway was passing over the bridge across the north branch of the Oromocto river to-day, the bridge gave way and the engine fell into the river. Fortunately it uncoupled itself and the cars remained on the track, one hanging over the gap. The engineer escaped with slight injuries. The fireman, named Smith, is missing. The night express from Boston soon afterwards passed over the south branch bridge and the engineer, learning of the disaster, attempted to back his train to Frederick junction. It was then discovered that the supports of the south branch bridge had given way and the train had a very narrow escape from a calamity. Both bridges have been under going repairs. Large mill Burned. East S agin aw, Mich., Dec. 10.— The saw mill of Benham & Stillwell was de stroyed by fire at an early hour this morn ing with about 200,000 feet of lumber.

Swavne was captured, after a des perate resistance, overpowered and brought to town, where he was given a preliminary hearing and sent to jail, where he will spend the honeymoon while the bride of two short days speeds her way husbandless to the West. Sbot to Good lAS oil. Eagle Pass, Tex., Dec. 10.— Sheriff Oglesby, with Robert Dowe and James Oliver, visited the Del Gardo ranch last evening with a warrant for the arrest of Manuel Del Garno on charges of smuggling and horse stealing. The ranch is twenty milps below Eairle Pass on tho Rio Grande, and has been famous for many years as a general rendezvous for "horse thieves and outlaws from both republics. A gang of Mexicans, smugglers and desperadoes, made it their headquarters. Arriving at the house the officers found Del Gardo asleep on the lower floor and were about to seize him when he awoke and fired at Dowe, the bullet graz ing his head. The sheriff instantly tired, sending a bullet through Del Gardo's heart. The firing aroused the gang, who attacked the officers and drove them from the ranch. Obtaining reinforcements from this place, the sheriff again attacked the ranch at 5 o'clock this morning. Many shots were exchanged. Three Mexicans were killed. The rest escaped into Mexico, carrying several wounded with them and taking about thirty horses, all of which are believed to be stolen. One of the smugglers was ar rested. Much plunder was found on the premises. Del Gardo had been a terror to the border and was reputed very rich. It is thought that the attack will result in breaking up the worst gang of smugglers of the border. The Italian Method. Home, Dec. 10. — The trial commenced here to-day of a butcher named Toszzi and his wife, son and daughter, who are charged with the murder of one Poggi, also a butcher. The motives for the crime were trade jealousy and family disputes. Poggi was entrapped into Toszzrs cellar, where the murder was committed. The body of the victim was cut into pieces and the re mains were scattered in a suburban wood, the blood was boiled into black puddings, which were sold in Toszzi's shop. The son made a confession to-day. He narrated the story in court with a cold-blooded cynicism which provoked a howl of fury, the audience yelling, "Away with him to the scaffold." In reply the murderer tauntingly screamed "Here I am;"— "tear me to pieces." The terrible story has created intense excite ment throughout the city. SENSATIONAL KILLING. Noted Counterfeiter Sbot in Cin cinnati. Special to the Globe. . Covingtox, Ky., Dec. 10.— A very sen sational and fatal shooting occurred ' here this evening in the United States marshal's office, next to the United States court house, which recalls not only the exploits of Miles Ogle, the celebrated counterfeiter, but the Breathitt county vendetta of last summer as well, Fifteen months ago Ed ward O'Neal, aged 28, of Detroit originally, but who had for some time belonged to Ogle's counterfeiting gang, was arrested in Lexington, Ky., for having in his possession counterfeit $10 bills of the Third National bank of Cincinnati, He was brought to Covington for safe keeping and at the last December term of the United States court was indicted. Be fore his trial the indictments were stolen. He has laid in jail until this term. He was reindicted and this afternoon was taken to the United States marshal's office adjoining the court room for trial. Twenty-one other prisoners were there for sentence. As they were ushed into the court room it left O'Neal and Bailiff Day alone in the room. The latter was seated near a table in the center of the room. In a drawer next to him was a forty-four-caliber pistol. He also had a razor on his person. As Day turned, after shr>win<r other nrisnnpra nut he was met by O'Neal, who had in the meantime taken a PISTOK FEOM A DRAWER. Day's first intimation of danger was feel ing a handful of pepper thrown into both his eyes. As they closed with pain, he caught a glimpse of a shining pistol barrel, leveled at his head. Instinctively he caught it with his right hand, and clutched O'Neal's throat with his left. He bore down on the pistol and as it was dis charged the bullet just grazed his l\ k i. Still holding his grasp, though in an agony of intense pain, he bore O'Neal backward, simultaneously wrenched the pistol from his hand and pointing it toward his antag onist, when he could no longer see, fired, shooting O'Neal through the body. The bullet entered the lower part of both lunge, bringing him to the floor. The whole thing was done in less time than it takes to tell it. Instantly all was confusion in the court room. Doctors were called, who dressed O'Neal's wounds, which they pro nounced necessarily fatal. Coroner De Gruyter was summoned to take his ante mortem statement, but found him uncon scious. He will investigate the case to morrow. In the meantime Bailiff Day, whose home is in Menifee county, gave himself up until an investigation is had. O'Neal is a slim-built, light-complexioned man, weighing 120 pounds. Day is one of the heroes of the celebrated Breathitt county war, some time since, and a very good officer. Hanged by a Mob. Kentok, Term., Dec. 10.— About 2 o'clock Tuesday morning two clerks in the store of White & Boyle were awakened by a suffocating smoke and discovered the store to be on fire. A thief had entered, stolen some goods and then fired the house. By prompt efforts the lire was extinguished. Had the young men been a few minutes later in making the discovery they would undoubtedly have been burned to death and the whole business portion of the town de stroyed. Soon afterwards Sam Fowler, a colored ex-convict, was caught with the stolen goods in his possession and he was promptly jailed. Yesterday morning his dead body was found dangling from the limb of a tree, where a mob during the night had hanged him. Specnlated in Stocks. Cincinnati, Dec. 10. — J. B.

The Strikers Encamped in the Woods, and Will Allow .Nobody to Ap proach Them. Strike of Switchmen in Chlcago—Meni Drilling With Winchester Rifles in Missouri. Riotous Strikers. Pittsbttkg, Dec. 10.— Pine Kun, about one mile below Elizabeth, Pa., was the scene of another riot this morning between the striking coal miners and the men who have been working for the past two weeks at the reduction. This morning about half past 3 o'clock, when twenty-live miners were on their way to work in Lynn's mines, a squad of 200 masked men met them and demanded that they return to their homes. This they refused to do and the mob then made an attack on them with clubs, sticks and stones. The riot lasted two hours and about ten men were injured. One of them, Newton Campbell, a driver, was set upon by six strikers and beaten to insensi bility. His injuries are believed to be fatal. Richard Hall and Samuel Myford were also seriously injured. The others got away with slight cuts and bruises. After holding their ground for nearly two hours the non unionists were driven off and fled to places of safety. The strikers then stayed in the vicinity of the mine until after daybreak, waiting for more miners to come to work, but none made their appearance. The mob then wedged the switch of the private coal road running to the mine and disappeared OVER THE HILLS. A train coming along a short time after was thrown from the track and the engine upturned, but no one was hurt. Word was immediately telegraphed to this city for as sistance and at 11 o'clock Sheriff Gray with a posse left for the scene. The mob is be lieved to be the one organized to visit all the mines to-day where the men are working at the reduction, and more trouble is antici pated. More trouble is feared among the striking coal miners and the men working. Word has been received in this city to the effect that a committee from the miners has been working aloug the river tor several days past gathering up volunteers to visit the miners working at the reduction. Tha men have been working for about two weeks at 2)4 cents. They have been asked to rejoin the strikers, but have refused, and now it is the purpose of the committee to compel them to quit work. Men have been secured from Elizabeth, McKeesport, Coal Centre and other points along thd river to march to the mines and request the men to come out. A strict order has been issued that no one shall be molested or harmed in any way unless resistance is offered. The leaders in the movement are said to be men selected from mines all along the river. Most of them have reputations take. FURTHER TROUBLE EXPECTED. 11 p. m. — There was no further trouble at Pine Run to-day, but another outbreak is looked for to-morrow morning. - Sheriff Gray returned to this city this afternoon and reported everything quiet. He is hold ing himself in readiness, however, and will start for the mines if there is any indica tion of another assault. The strikers are camped in the woods some distance from the mines, but will not allow any one to ap proach them. The people living in the vicinity are greatly alarmed and anticipate a general raid along the river. Supt, O'Neill of the Pine Run mines says he be lieves the mob will attack the mines again to-night and that an effort will be made to burn the tipples and engine house. The movement seems to have been a thoroughly organized one, as secret meetings of the strikers have been held daily for a week. It is believed that the Allequippa mines will be the next point of attack, as bus* . picious-looking men have been hanging around all day. This evening fifty Win chester rifles were shipped to the Allequippa ; mines to be distributed among the non» union men. They will be supplied with fifty rounds of amunition, and bloodshed is i quite probable if the strikers attempt to/ disturb the men on their way to and from? the mines. It was learned to-night thai?; they paid a visit to Walton's mines, neari Elizabeth, this morning during the absence; of the workmen and destroyed their tools»j They also broke off the end gates of the coal wagons, which were standing on the . tipple loaded, and then dumped the coal I out. Drilling- With Winchesters. Brevier, Mo., Dec. 10. — The warlike preparations being made here for the last week still continue. There are two regular companies, composed of white men, who drill daily with Winchester rifles. It ha£ been discovered that an organized attack upon the stockade is to be made Saturday < if Mr. Loomis does not disarm his men. j This he positively declines to do. He says •■ he has discharged the roughs and disreputa- i ble characters from the mines, and those who remain he knows will participate in no quarrel unless in self-defense.

Great alarm and anxiety is felf , among the peaceably-inclined citizens. ancl,i they fear serious trouble will follow Loomis' ' refusal to disarm his men. Switchmen Strike. Chicago, Dec. 10. — The switchmen em- j ployed in the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy 1 railway yards have struck. The night men ' quit last night and the day men are ex- ] pected to go out this morning. The trouble : is a continuance of the misunderstanding of some weeks ago. The night men went to work at 7 p. m. and were frequently com pelled to quit work by the engines being called in, which stopped the switching, and they were paid only for the actual time put in, while they demanded a full night's pay if they worked until midnight, and half night's pay if they reported for duty at all, and the company acceded to the demand,, but recently the operators found, so they claim, that the company had failed to keep to their agreement, and after giving notice two days ago, struck last night ~So freight is moving and the switchmen are idle. The latter are collected in groups in the yards, but have not resorted to vio lence of any kind. The President Sustained.
