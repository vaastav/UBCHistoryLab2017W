The Supervisors have made the highly sensational suggestion of forcing the company to give school-children cheaper carfare. The preat range area west of the ninety-ninth me ridian must resort to leasing and restoration, or the only industry for which much of it is fitted must pass The consumer has a direct interest in increasing the supply. There is but one way to such increase, and that is by restoring the carrying capacity of the ranges. They have now only one-third the capacity they had six years ago. Two-thirds of the area is obsoleted by absolute extirpation of the forage. The cattle industry has vanished and left drought and desert behind it. The only increase of the forage, and therefore of the carrying capacity of the range, is in Texas. That State leases the ranges, and the Agri cultural Department has aided the leaseholder in re seeding the ranges and' renewal of their forage. This is a decline in range cattle of 66 per cent in six years. No wonder that butcher's meat is higher on the block. The receipts at Chicago of range cattle exhibit a de cline that is common to all slaughtering centers. In 1895 Chicago handled 429,300 head; in 1896, 272,000; in 1897, 236,300; in 1808, 195,175; in 1899, 177,300; in 1900, 142,600. The decline of the stock industry, brought about by destruction of the feed on the free range, has at last reached the consumers of meat in the form of a higher price for that food. The marketing of range cattle for 1000 is about over and shows a progressive decrease. HITHERTO California has had but little to say in the conventions of the National Livestock Association.

We have written of our "Italian skies," of our days as 'charming as those in the Riviera," and we have spoken of California zs "the Italy of America." It is time to drop all that sort of comparison. We are injuring the State when we use it, for there is nothing in Italy that in any way equals the charm of a Cali fornian winter. Here is a case in point. On November 14 the Westminster Gazette of London published a letter from a private correspondent in Milan, in which the writer said: "What a wretched place is Milan in wintry weather! Lately the streets have been deep in slush or sticky with mud. * * * Everywhere for days the fog has been of the thin, peasoup variety. To step in and out of a cab was enough to condemn any poor creature in petticoats to a deep mud trim ming at the hem of her garment, and all Milan seemed to cough as if it had but one choked lung." Just contrast that with the weather we are having all over California since the rains came to start the grass growing in the valleys and on the hillsides. It is true the reference to the "one choked lung" sug gests Los Angeles; but that is not because of any defect in the Los Angeles climate. The one lungsters in that place are not natives, nor are they persons of long residence. There, as elsewhere in California, the winter season is one of wholesome air and general joyousness. Let us hear no more talk about "the Italy of 'America" in connection with this State. Florida may have that title if her people wish it. There is but one California on earth, and it has no rival. OUR WINTER CLIMATE. This new movement has been started in Maine by the organization of "The Co- "I believe that by the conservation of energy— by the elimination of the middle men and of the Idea of competition, every man, woman and child could live well, without money or overwork." "You may buy clothes at less than the cost of manufacture— yet many men have to go about with ragged clothes. Why? Because of lack of system. "In Maine," eaid Mr. Peck, "the apples rot on the ground, yet here people starve. Throughout the country there is more food produced than could ever be consumed, yet men and women go hungry- The bar gain counter Is the result of undercon sumption, due to lack of proper system of, distribution. He believes that Bellamy's scheme of lifo outlined In "Looking Backward" can be put Into operation. Indeed, he is con fident t^at before the first quarter of the twentie'.. 1 century shall have ended the entire United States shall have become one grand co-operative concern, with ev ery man, woman and child a shareholder; all enterprises shall be under national ownership, all middle men, stock Jobbers, agents and drummers shall have been done away with; every commodity shall be made and sold at the lowest cost and the lowest price, and every citizen shall enjoy to the fullest the result of his la bors. According to Peck's great scheme, no person who is willing to work shall be in fear of want through illness or lack of work. Peck comes from Lewiston, Me., where he Is at the head of one of the largest dry goods houses in New England and president of the largest real estate com pany. He Is also president of the Jollet (111.) Dry Goods Company. A 

MILD mannered man, whose aim In life Is to make of the world one grand "department store," Is a guest at the Everett House, says the New York World. His name Is Bradford Peck. He is wealthy and an en thusiast on the subject of solving all so cial and economic questions by the forma tion of "The People's Trust." Mr. Peck Is In communication with prominent ministers, teachers, leaders and capitalists and expects soon to Interest them in the movement. He began life as a cash boy for Jordan, Marsh & Co. of Boston. "The movement will tend to depopulate great cities like New York, for men will not have to herd In tenements. The farm cr, like the doctor, can live in a com fortable apartment and go to and from his work as easily as do the merchants of New York who live far up on the Hud son's bnnks." "Every man will do his share of work, according to his ability, and shall receive for life enough to support himself well. "There will be no trust but the people's trust. Everything will be under national control. Just as the postofflce is now. "From the city of Lewlston, we hope, the movement will soon grow over the en tire State, and within twenty-five years I predict the entire people of the country will be In one grand co-operative organ ization. "Now. that Is just how we expect our movement to grow. When, as we hope in the near future, an organization shall control not only restaurant but model dwellings and stores, and the people of Lewleton see how one-quarter of the city has developed. It Is safe to say that they will soon fail into line. "All the members of the association should profit by every enterprise. All de partment stores begin small. The shoe maker and the dry goods man pool their Interests, and then the milliner joins them and the clothier and the furniture man, and finally you have a store where everything can be bought. Peck's big dry goods store la co-opera tive in the sense that the employes share in the profits, but he wants to go further. "The movement so far," said Mr. Peck, "has proved successful and profitable — the profits going entirely to the cause.

Under a charter a primary organization has been started In Lewiston, where the 250 members dine at cost price In a building donated for the purpose. • - F:>r these reasons the majority should not pause nor falter in accomplishing all that it put in issue and risked in the ballots . These are the great business measures of what I-romis.es to be a business session of Congress. If a disappointed minority attempt to fritter away the time h« frivolous discussion and bombastic appeals to the country, let it be remembered that an appeal on these issues has just been heard by the country and decided against that minority. The maritime States of Maine, New Hampshire. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Con necticut. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware. Maryland. California, Oregon and Wash ington, joining the lake States of Minnesota, Wiscon sin, Illinois, Michigan. Indiana and Ohio, have de cided the appeal, and there can be no motion for a i:ew trial entertained until 1004. What unspeakable folly it would be to pause now and wait, as the mi nority will demand, until thrv can reargue the issue! In its strictest sense there is no minority, and we are sorry for it. The leaders like Jones and Stone, and newspaper organs like the Examiner. Journal and World, and the Southern press, are busy as suring the country that they were not sin cere in their support of the "paramount" and "immediate" issues of the late campaign. No one is bound to heed their protests as to any issue, since they have no proof that they mean what they say. A real minority must issue from the chaos on that side, led by men who will be believed by the country when they take a position upon any of the great questions. Shipyards can be kept bus.y here for years to come, and marine architecture and construction be made per rnanent industries for cur people if we now make our selves fe!t in favor of the canal and shipping bill. The protocols negotiated by United States Minister .Merry with Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and signed last week at Washington, fairly open the canal ques tion. It feems now that the canal is to be neutralized and under American control. All the rights we need on the soil of the two isthmian republics are provided for in the protocols, to be secured in the treaties which will follow. The construction of the canal should be a matter of months rather than years. If pushed with the energy which was shown by the build ers of our first overland railroad ships built under the encouragement of a revival act could hardly be ready in time to take cargo and steam through it at the fin ish. The engineering problems are simple, and it is only a question of money and energy. Let this be borne in mind, that construction of the canal will b: a great economy in transportation and will be followed by a great expansion of ship-building. This vas the result when the mapping of ocean currents and winds, and the development of Great Circle tailing, by Maury, economized ocean transportation '\) the amount of sevral millions a year. The revival «iue to canal construction will be greater than that, since the actual economy in time and distance will be .greater and the commerce economized is vastly larger in volume. The Pacific Coast is now in a position to profit by re-creating cur merchant navy. We build ships here, and the canal and the Pacific trade will re quire fleets of them. With us it is a question whethc these fleets shall be under the flags of Great Britain, Germany and Norway, or under our own. The building of an isthmian canal is almost second ary to the need of our own ships to carry through it our own commerce. We find ourselves now able to feed the world, to clothe it and to manufacture for it, but able to carry only nine per cent of our foreign trade under our flag! THERE is no doubt that the great contests of this session of Congress will come in the con sideration of the canal and shipping bills. Both coasts of the country are at la«t alive to the fact th-.i the building of the canal only emphasizes the need of re-creating our commercial marine. We lost our lead on the sea at the beginning of the Civil War. While all of our energies were enlisted in that great strug gle there occurred one of those economic revolutions which change the face and front of affairs. This was the substitution of iron for wood in the construction oi ships. Men now living can remember when it was hotly argued that an iron ship could not be made to float, but the discussion was without interest to us. for we had no metal ships. England at once forged to the front as the builder of the new craft. She had been admonished by the condition in which she found hcrsc'f during the Crimean war, when she had to char ter American clippers for troop transports to carry her army to the shores of the Black Sea. English statesmanship never forgets a lesson of that kind, and. catching us when our enterprise was either paralyzed or intensely occupied in a civil war, she made the most of her opportunity, and so it came to pass that "Britannia Rules the Wave" soon outpiped "Colurr bia, the Gem of the Ocean." THE WORK OF CONGRESS. THE L.EWIST0N (ME.) DRY GOODS MERCHANT WHO AVERS THAT THE THEORY OP EDWARD BELLAMY'S "LOOKING BACKWARD" CAN BE PUT INTO PRACTICAL OPERATION. At present the most serious questions with which our fruit-growers are concerned in the line of their work are those of procuring a speedier system of transportation to the markets of the world and pro viding for that co-operative method of doing busi ness which now seems destined to prevail for years to come in almost all departments of industry. It is with those issues the convention will deal, and it is safe to say there will be no lack of sound counsel pre sented on every point under discussion. The meeting ii to be one of the most important industrial gather ings of the season, and the results will well repay all who attend. It is now fairly well understood what sections of California are best adapted for fruit-growing and what kinds of fruit can be most profitably cultivated in each, but now a new set of problems confront the progressive men who lead the industry. The rapid increase in the output renders it more and more im portant to provide economical methods of handling the product, preparing it for market and supplying it to the consumer. These are large problems and re quire a business sagacity of a .high order to prop erly solve them. Fortunately our fruit industry is in the hands of men quite capable of dealing with all matters of that kind. The California fruit-growers as a body are perhaps the most advanced class of rural workers in the world. They have a fuller knowledge of the scientific side of their industry and a larger experience in business affairs than other classes en gaged in the cultivation of the soil. Thus they arc well prepared to understand the problems that arise in their industry from time to time and to deal with them in the most effective way. Despite the many advantages of soil and climate, fruit-growing in California has not been easily built up. Our orchards are far from the great markets of the country, and the cost of transportation has too often been all that the traffic would bear. Moreover, the conditions of the industry here are so different from those in the Eastern or Southern States that the beginnings of the industry were largely experimental. Many a man planted an orchard without knowing whether it would succeed, and in not a few cases failure resulted. Thousands of dollars and much of time, energy and skill were required to establish the industry upon the basis it now occupies, and to the pioneers who led the way in the work, took the chances and overcame the difficulties California owes much. /^» 

ALIFORNIA'S fruit-growers will meet to-day l^ at Pioneer Hall for their twenty-fifth annual V -T convention. Were they inclined to do so the gathering^ could be made the occasion for a review of the work accomplished by the pioneers and up builders of the industry that in a striking way would illustrate the progress that has been made in scientific horticulture and in the production of wealth from orchards. It is not for history, however, but for busi ness the convention meets, and accordingly the pa pers and discussions will deal with the present and the future and not, with the past. 

CALIFORNIA'S FRUIT-GROWERS. Under It the Whole United States Will Be One Grand Co-operative Concern. BRADFORD PECK OF MAINE PLANS A "PEOPLE'S TRUST" The. consumers will soon demand a policy that re news the raising of range cattle. They have rights which the Government and all concerned must heed. The meat-packers and exporters are allies of the con sumers in urging a leasing policy that will restock the ranges, as are all the Western railroads, which depend on livestock for an important part of their tonnage. The shortage ramifies in many directions. If the railroads lose tonnage in one direction they must meet their fixed charges by making it out of a rise in other articles transported. The issue, viewed in all its lights, becomes a serious one, and the rem edy should be sought with intelligence and energy. It is to be hoped that California will be heard at Salt Lake in favor of some policy that will save a great industry and stop advance in the cost of living. away. The question has passed beyond the stock men themselves, who are divided in sentiment and quar reling over what feed is left. It concerns the con sumer now. The present rise in meat is 20 per cent. There is no natural reason .why it should not go on till it equals the 66 per cent decline in range stock. Upon the subject of the Nicaragua canal the Presi dent contents himself with the announcement that the State Department is now considering claims made by the Maritime Canal Company and the Eyre-Cragin Company against the Nicaraguan Government, and overtures for a convention to effect the construction of the canal, and closes by commending to the atten tion of the Senate "the convention with Great Brit ain to facilitate the construction of such a canal and tc remove any objection which might arise out of the convention commonly called the Clayton- Bulwer tieaty." The length of the message should not deter any citizen from reading it as a whole. It is an important and interesting summary of the history of the year so far as it affects the United States, written by the man who has been the most potent factor in directing the course of our country. Upon the side of domes tic politics it abounds with recommendations of legis lation needed to confirm existing order and prosper ity and to make improvement better still. He asks Congress to insure the continued parity under all con ditions between our two forms of metallic money, silver and gold. He recommends the reduction of the internal revenue tax, the upbuilding of our merchant marine, the regulation of trusts, legislation for Porto Rico and the Philippines, the construction of the Ha waiian cable, and the enactment of many other meas ures for the general benefit. Some law of the kind recommended by the Presi dent is imperatively required if we are to retain a reputation as a just nation. In this very message the President has occasion to refer to claims for indem nity made upon various foreign Governments for wrongs done to American citizens, and it is clear that if our Government cannot grant redress to others it will have but a poor showing on the score of justice and consistency when it makes demands upon them. Commenting upon the evil resulting from this con dition of affairs he adds: "I renew the urgent recom mendations I made last year that the Congress ap propriately confer upon the Federal courts jurisdic tion in this class of international cases where the ulti mate responsibility of the Federal Government may be involved, and I invite action upon the bills to ac complish this which were introduced in the Senate and House. It is incumbent upon us to remedy the statutory omission which has led and may again lead to such untoward results. I have pointed out the ne cessity and the precedent for legislation of this char acter. Its enactment is a simple measure of previsory justice toward the nations with which we as a sov ereign equal make treaties requiring reciprocal ob servance." Another question of indemnity for international wrong referred to in .1 different part of the message may well be considered in this connection — that is the demand of Italy for redress for wrongs done to her citizens in this country by mob law in Louisiana. The President says: "Notwithstanding the efforts of the Federal Government, the production of evidence tending to inculpate xhe authors of this grievous of fense against our civilization, ani the repeated in quests set on foot by the authorities of the State of Louisiana, no punishments have followed." As to the indemnity itself the President says: "Measured in money alone, a sufficient reparation may prove to be beyond the ability of China to meet. All the powers concur in emphatic disclaimers of any purpose of aggrandizement through the dismember ir.ent of the empire. I am disposed to think that due compensation may be made in part by increased guar antees of security for foreign rights and immunities, and. most important of all, by the opening of China to the equal commerce of all the world. These views have been and will be earnestly advocated by our rep resentatives." The chief interest in the message not only to us but to the world at large centers in what is said of the crisis in China and our relations to it. On that sub ject the President writes with elaboration and narrates the proceedings that led up to the Boxer outrages and brought about the present situation. He an nounces that the disposition of the Chinese Govern ment to admit liability for wrongs done to foreign ers, and "to act upon such additional designation of the guilty persons as the Foreign Ministers at Peking may be in a position to make," gives hope of a com plete settlement of all questions involved. He fur ther asserts it to be "one of the essential factors of a durable adjustment" that there be given secure and adequate guarantees for liberty of faith for natives as well as for foreigners. Finally he expresses approval of a suggestion put forward by the Government of Russia, "that in the event of a protracted divergence of views in regard to indemnities to be demanded of China, the matter be relegated to the court of arbitra tion at The Hague." T~ 

PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S message is much L_-/ longer than necessary. Much of it is devoted * to an historical review of the events of the year, and while it is gratifying to have an official statement concerning the action of our Government in them, it is to be noted that the statement contains little or nothing that is new.
