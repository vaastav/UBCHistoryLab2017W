That State, until the reeoot election, in which the people took part, was intomel loyal in ell departments ot in government. It preented thet anomaly in politice of en intensely Rad ical end loyal government, with a eo culled intensely disloyal constituency, the adminis tration beiuff under the auspices and in the interest of those who ley great stress on a republican form of government. At the August election this deformity in political architecture and alienation between people and government was removed, and the gov ernment made to harmonize with the ill of the people. Thin change of coure brought into offioa representatives of the 10 called rebel clement, who, we were as lured, would undo all that loyalty bad dime for the State. Well, it appears that this i to be the cae, for the telegeaph brings the newt from Nashville, that one branch ol the Legislature bat actually paned a bill pro viding that the salaries of all civil officers, exoepting the Governor, Judgee and Chan cellors, bow in office, ahall be reduced one half, the same reduction extending to mem ber! of the Legislature, Judges, Chancel lor! and Governor! hereafter elected. The disloyalty of tbie measure ia fearfnl when it is remembered that the salaries just re duced were voted to themselves by a receof carpet baggers and home made loyalist!, who had but little or no property to pay taxes oa, and were therefore loyally partki- tmnti only in tlie benefits, and not in the t burdens of liberal compensation for die tinguished official eervices to the State Will Congress take notice of this flagrant departure from Radical paths by the rebel I. ei'islature of Tennessee, and institute an r - i inquiry into the right of a tax-ridden, prop erty-holding people to relieve themselves of oppressive burdens, and protect themselves from robbery ' THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST GEORGIA $Tbe outrageous recommendation of Prei iduut Grant that the whole civil structure ot Georgia be uprooted by a Radical Congress Vieciwui iv U,lUtw W refused lu ndmit to seat! in that body a few negroes, on the ground that tbey wore not eligiblo to seat! under the constitution, indicates too clearly the evtent of bis subserviency to the worst phasea of Radicalism. 'I hut the whole sclietuu is a conspiracy against the state government and pcoplu of Georgia, in the iDiBreit of a lew Radical malcoulents, there is s.arcelv a doubt. Thatthis is the case, aud that Geu. Grant has lent t'ne iniluence of his high oilico to a coterie of desperate plotters ami despicable politicians of small calibre, we introduce the following from the New York Wot Id, whose editor has traced thesoheme to its source: The Augusta, Macou, and Columbus pa pers, just at baud, expluin the whole of this shameful conspiracy. The Republican State Central Committee held a caucus at Atlanta on the 1st inst., and reBolved to at it-mot to induce Congress "to take a snap iudiiineut uimn Georgia, before the I.egis inture could of its own motion satisfy the demands of Conifress by reseating lb negro members and ratifying the tilieenth amendment. They agreed to ask Congress to annul a. I legislation so far had nnder the constitution of 1807. put the Statu under ft euberualurial dictatorship, with Mullock as supremo reconstruetor, so that, backed by the military power, "the negroes should bu reseated, and the Legislature purged of ev ery man who cauuot take the reconstruction test oath." This is exactly what the caucus resolved to ask on the 1st ol Pecember; n is exactly what President Grant reenrn mends on the Glh of December. Governor Mullock departed for Washington immedi atelv alter the caucus, and that bn l.ui had good sucoess in his missinn the President's message abuudantly proves. Mefore he left Georgia, Mullock issued an extraordinary proclamation, reciting at length numerous so-called political outrages committed during the past i'ourteeu months, fur the purpose ot taking it to Washington and displaying it there as evidence that a state of intolerance towards Radicals and Republicans exists in Georgia. Noao o' shese outrages have any political bearing at all; aud even Forney, whj visited Georgia a short time ago, was so impressed with the peaceful and harmo nious state of things there that he printed the other day, in one of his papers, an ap peal to Congress to let nil tho Southern alone for tho future, on the ground that they were doing well enough, and that all f-Ttlir-r interference with them would bo prejudicial and injurious. Mut tho conspir acy has succeeded, as fir as the President is concerned; he has shown his willingness to be male the tool of tho Georgia carpet baggers; and it now remains to be seen if Gongreas will be equally subservient. If the State is li-i't alone she will do her duty aud, if necessary, she will even ratify the tilteeuln amendment and admit the negro members to their sea's. But this will not satisfy the ambition of the adventurers. They demand that the whole work of recon struction be done over again, in order that they may be kept in power a little longer. There is perhaps a faint hope that Congress will refuse to aid their schemes, at such a cost; although, now that the President has Iwen made a party to the conspiracy, the chances of its success are only too great. The Cunningham Dnrdell Murder. We have already mentioned the death ol Eckel in Sing Sing prison, and the fact that he made a dying statement about the Cun ningham Bard ell murder, in which he was supposed to have been implicated. We take from the Albany Argus the subjoined ac count of Kckel's deaiU aud reference to the murder itself : Oil Friday night, John J. Eckel died at the Albany pcniieutiary, of heart disease. Kckei was sent to the penitentiary over a year ago, together with Calioott and one or two other prominent members of the whisky ring, for frauds upon the Internal Revenue kckel was still more extensively known to the world from the fact that he was arrested and indicted upon the charge of being im plicated in the murder of Dr. Harvey Bur dell, the wealthy Bond street dentist. This ease is oiie of the envres aU'brti in the . criminal history of the United States. The murder itself was shocking; but the subse quent developments through which it was sought, at ouce, to acquit Mrs. Cunningham of the crime and to establish ber right to the property of tU murdered man the bogus marriage, in which somebody in disguise personated Dr. Burdell to Mrs. Cunning ham'e role ol bride, ana in which the Rev. Uriah Marvin, formerly of tts city, figured at the officiating clergyman, the bogus baby plot, the trial and acquittal of the principal, who waa almost universally believed to be the murdered these and other incident, made the case one of tbe most - exciting cri minal trials that ever ocenred in tbe history of tkii country. There waa, we believe, bo vidence suthoieut to justify Kckel s eon- yiotion, end tbe ground! of hie arrest were the fact that he slept in tbe Bond street house on the night of the tragedy, and that he was understood to be a lover of Mrs. Cunningham. Ii was alio suspeoted that he was tbe person who personated Dr. Burdell in the bogui marriage. There were considered to be lulHcient grounds to juitify bi! arrest and indictment as an accessory to the tnur der;and np to tbe present time suspicion bas attached to him in tbe minds of many, con nesting bim with the fearful tragedy. After the announcement had been made to Eckel that he must die, we are informed that, at the suggestion of a prominent citiztn Kckel's partner in crime, Calicot, had an interview with him, for the purpose of draw ing from him any disclosure be might feel disposed to make in regard to the murder of . , ,1 l. , .
