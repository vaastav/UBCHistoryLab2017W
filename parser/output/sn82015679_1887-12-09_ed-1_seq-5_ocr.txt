THE INDIANA POIjIS JOURNAL, FRIDAY DECEMBER 9, 18ST. THE C, II. & D. SUES M'KEEN Judge Gresham Is Asked to Restrain Him from Selling Vandalia Stock, Ind a Temporary Injunction Is Granted History of the Peal Ives Goes to Terre Haute to Consult with McKeen. There was a great deal of mysterious consul tation and bustling about in tho immediate yicinuyei use unuea ciates court-rooms yes terday mornine. Mr. C. W. Fairbanks appeared to have something important on his mind, and subsequent developments showed that bis appearance was not deceptive. He and Ramsey Is Maxwell filed a suit on behalf of the Cin einoati, Hamilton & Dayton Railway Company against W. R. McKeen, of Terre Haute, asking o injunction against the sale of certain stock. Judges Oteaham and Wood got together, and after hearing the "bill granted a temporary Injunction. Marshall Hawkins left at noon for Terre Haute to serve the papers. The complaint meanwhile was withdrawn from file until 3 'clock in the afternoon, when Hawkins tele graphed that he had serrice. The bill charges that prior to June 4, 1887, Henry S. Ives, who was at the time Tice-presi lent of the CL, H. & D.f received authority from the directors of that company to purchase, as trustee for that company, 20,000 shares of the stock of the Terre Haute & Indianapolis, a cor poration which has less than 40,000 shares in its japital stock, of the par value of $50 each, and k pay therefor not to exceed $100 pec share; that McKeen, having full knowledze of the icope of Ives's authority, and of the action of ihe CL, H. & D. directors, sold to'lves, as trustee !or the C,E & D., 11,160 shares of T. H. & I. . ttock at $100 per share, amounting to $1,116,000, ind Ives paid to the defendant on account of ihe purchase $S89,500, leaving a balance due of 220,500. Ives also purchased at the same time Irom the T. H. & L Railroad Company, throueh. UcKeen as president, 8,810 shares of the T. H. Sb I. stock which stock belonged to the T. H., & I., and stood in the name of President Mc Keen as trustee at $02.50 per share, amounting to So52.o00. and paid therefor on behalf of the plaintiff $552,500. As a part of this transaction, and in consideration of the sale by President pIcKaen of the 8.840 shares of stock. Ives, unknown to the plaintiff, agreed to pay to Mc Keen, individually, 75 per cent, of the amount f the stock so sold bv bim as president the sum of $331.500 and further to purchase from McKeen. individually, 4,446 shares at the par value or $oU each; of the stock of the Terre . Haute & Logansport Railroad Company at 50 per cent., $111,150, which last mentioned stock Was of little or no value. To cover the sum of $331,500; $111,150 and $226,500, the last amount Ixtin? the halanea ranllv dan on thm nnrrhnom nf the 11,160 shares of Terre Haute & Indianapolis stock. Ives executed his note as trustee to the rder of McKeen, dated Jan. 4, 1837, payable at the option of Ives on or before six months, for . the sum of $669,150. with 6 per cent, interest. ,, end delivered to McKeen, as collateral security for the note, 11,160 shares of stock of the Terre ' T 7 - . - p. r j : i : j . t Ate -i m jauic a, luumiiBpons auu u , iiu auarsa ni Terre Haute & Logan sport stock, with authori ty to McKeen to sell the stock after default in Ihe payment of the note, without notice. Tha nlainliff . Vi ni.a that tli Afani4anf Ir n n that Ives had no authority to purchase the Terre Haute & Logaosport stock for or on account of the C, H. & D., nor to pledge the 11.160 shares f the stock of the T. H. & I., or any part there of, on account of the purchase of the stock of the T. H. & L. The defendant now has the 11,- lou snares or tne I . a. es JL stock in bis posses IL eion, and claims to hold the same as collateral security for the note of $669,150. The bill further charges that lyes pretended to the plaintiff that all of the T. H. & I. stock heretofore mentioned 11,160 shares and 8,840 hares had been purchased by Ives at $100 per snare, and tne plaintiff, nas so believed until re cently. The real indebtedness, the plaintiff avers, is $I6.o00, with a month's interest at 6 per cent., which sum the plaintiff is will ing 10 pay. ana nas onerea to pay upon tne return or tne 11,150 snares or T. JtL & :L stock. . Ihe defendant refuses to accept, how ever, or to deliver to the plaintiff the stock, and tnreatens to immediately sell the stock to some third person who may not have notice of the rights of the plaintiff, upon pretense that the nalanee due the defendant is $669,la0. On this .-. statement of fact the bill asks a temporary re- . straining order to prevent Mr. McKeen from dis posing of the 11.160 shares of the T. II. & L stock, and further prays that, upon final hear ing, the defendant be required either to accept from the plaintiff $226,500, with interest, in full nd final payment, and to cancel the note against plaintiff and to deliver up the 11,160 lhares of stock, or that the defendant be re quired to eaneel the note and return to the plaintiff the sum of $889,a00, with interest After considering the bill, and consulting with Judge Woods, Judge Grisham granted an order restraining the defendant from in any way dis posing of the 11,160 shares of T.. H. & L stock, and set the case for farther hearing on Dec. 22, last. , .. On the same train that bore Marshal Hawkins to Terre Hante, by a strange coincidence, Mr. Henry S. Ives was a passenger. He was travel ing in the unassuming style of a man who has 10 pay nis iare, instead or a special car and a guard, as he was wont to when he figured as the xsapoleon of finance. He had a ticket for Kan sas City, and stated that he was bound for that point. The complaint, as presented, charges only nn- auioonzea action on me pari ot ives as vice- president, with Knowledge of the same on the part of McKeen. It orieinally charged fraud, sverriug that Ives and McKeen .had made an agreement to divide the sum of $351,000 tho 75 per cent of the purchase money of the 8,840 shares charged to have been paid to McKeen but this allegation was stricken out before the ill was filed. Day before yesterday several of the C,H. & u. officials called on 31 r. McKeen, at Terre Haute, and tried to make some arrangement with bim in regard to the matter. He is report ed as saying, in an interview, that nothing was laid to him by them in regard to paying the aotes; that, in fact, he did not understand what ihe gentlemen came for. He said that Ives Pad forfeited the money paid, amounting to more than $600,000, as well as the hypothecated stock. Ihe visitors, Messrs. Dexter. Hoffer and Max well, left for Cincinnati at midnight. Ives In Consultation with Sir. McKeen. Jpecial to the Indiananoiis Journal. Terre Haute, Ind., Dee. 8. United States Marshal Hawkins served notice -. on President ilcKeen, of the Terre Haute & Indianapolis ompany, this afternoon, of the granting of the .empor&ry restraining order issued by Judge jrresham, at Indianapolis, against disposal of be stock of that company held by him as se mrity on the note for $669,500 given by Ives, ind which went by default in New York resterday. The complaint alleges that Mr. TW 1 . . icieen may sen tne stocc to some third party. It ean be said on the highest inthority that the purpose is to Keep the stock sere, and that the Vandalia road is not likely to )ass out of the McKeen control. It is the inten tion to operate the road, and there is no prob- binty of its passing into the bands of a third parry, mr. jucteen nas no oesire to dispose of bis interest, which is cow even larger than it ever was. The note given by Ives was siened ' Henry S. Ives, Trustee." In the trade there was no legal connection of the Cincin nati, Hamilton & Dayton company, the note not having been given by Ives as trustee for that company. Ives never claimed that he acted as such, and now says he did not It takes two to make a trade, and the C. H. & D. lid not appear as one of the two. Whatever resolution may have been adopted by the CL. II. fc D. board of directors, it is held, did not ope rate to make a trade on its own account, as Mr. McKeen did not deal with the board of directors. The same train that brought the United States Marshal bere. also brought Henry. S. Ives. He tried to make his . trip a leeret one, but an Indianapolis evening paper announced that he had passed-through .here, and the trainmen knew him, so that hen he alichtod from the train the word went rora mouth to mouthy until this evenine all the Wwn is talking about his presence here. He is registered at the hotel as ""Henry Seymour, of New York." He is accompanied bv a gentleman who is registered as ''William 'Carson. New Yort."

A Big Reduction of Kates. Chicago, Dec, 8. The general managers of be lines between Chicago and the Missouri river set to-day. and formally adopted the report of the general freight agents arranging for a reduction of freight rates in Illinois, Iowa and Missouri, and of through rates from Chicago to the Missouri river. The reductions are on all classes of freight, and will average fully 25 per eent. below the present tariffs in force. It was agreed that the new rates should go into effect Jan. 1, if the Wabash could be persuaded to postpone action until that date; if not, then on Dec. 20. The reductions mean a loss ot $10,000,000 per annum in net revenues. Salt Against the Pennsylvania. Pittsburg, Dec 8. Papers are being pre pared for a suit against the Pennsylvania rail road for $114,000, by Holdship & Irwin, "oil re finers, of this city. The firm alleges that the Pennrylvania railroad has unjustly discrimi nated against them in rates, and that seven simila claims have been settled quietly within thn last six months for amounts aggregating over $100,000. Suit will be entered in accordance with an act of 1883, which allows a claim for three times the amount of loss sustained. Hold ship & Irwin's information shows that in 1885 and 1886 certain shippers of oil were granted a rebate of 10 cents per barrel by the Pennsyl vania railroad. They will ask for three times what the rebate would amount to $114,000, with interest since 1885. Forcible Resistance to Railroad Building. Cawllac, Mich., Dec 8. The Toledo, Ann Arbor & Cadillac railroad, in course of construc tion, has met with much opposition from farm ers whose land it crosses in this vicinity. Last night a farmer named Chapin built a shanty on the grade of the road, and when the iron gang reached the place this afternoon they found Chapin, his two sons, and four others occupying the shanty, all armed, and threatening to shoot unless the gang desisted in their work. They did not heed the warning, and two of their num ber were shot, one in the hand and the other in the bewels. The farmers were arrested. Sensational Report Denied. Chicago, Dec. 8. The officials of the Illinois Central road deny the report, published to-day, that a gigantic railroad deal was about to be consummated here, whereby the Illinois Central would secure control of the Mobile & Ohio road. The only foundation for the report is said to be the fact that J. C Clarke, ex-president of the Illinois Central, was requested by the debenture bondholders of the Mobile & Ohio to inspect the property and finances of the company for them. This Mr. Clark did. making a eareful investiea tion, and then writing an elaborate report as to the state of affairs. -. Local and State Notes. There is a great demand for ears to load with grain. Dealers will not buy unless assured that they can get cars promptly, and train-masters are doing all in their power to furnish them. Over 600 of the officials and employes of the Pennsylvania Company attended the funeral of the late master mechanic of the road, Robert Curtis, which occurred on Tuesday last at Co lumbus O. It is stated that after the reorganization of the Philadelphia & Reading. Austin Corbin will be elected as president and A. A- McLeod, well known in Western railroad circles, will be elected first vice-president. The Cincinnati. Wabash & Michigan manage ment has laid three miles of private switches at Marion, Ind., within tne last four months, to accommodate the manufactories which have hprung np there since natural gas was dis covered. The New Cumberland, West Virginia, braneh of the PanUbndle lines, was yesterday opened for business, and last mgnt the citizens of the place celebrated the event. At this point there are several large potteries and a large tile man ufactory. The I, N. A. & CL rosd earned, in November. $182,563; increase over earnings corresponding month in 1886. $14,184. . There is not a road in Indiana which did not show an increase last month over November, 1886, most of them of from 12 to 15 per cent The shipments of Indiana coals to Chicago and points in that vicinity are now well on to five hundred ear-loads a day, and Colonel Yeo man, who has just returned from there, says that 1,000 per day could as readily be sold in Chicago and points northwest, as half that quantity.,, The Indianapolis & Vincennes company has just completed a commodious and attractive depot at Spencer, Ind., and is erecting two more on tne coal-branch extension, treneral Super intendent Miller, and other officials of the Penn sylvania Company, yesterday made an inspec tion of the line. For five months past the Iake Erie & West ern road has been hanling into Findlay, O. from twenty-five to forty car-loads of building material a day, and it is believed that by next year the in and out-bound shipments at that point will yield a revenue to the Lake Erie & Western of $400,000 per annum. ii,ast-Pouna passenger rates were fully re stored to tariff, yesterday, while west-bound rates are shaded more or less, the ticket agent dividing his commission. Travel to the Pacific coast has fallen off sharply the last ten days. which was rather unexpected nntil Jan. 1. when rates to California points advance $20 the roaod trip. The Chicago & brand Trunk is out of export business via Portland, although it has not with drawn its tarins. jne Alien line will run no more steamers to that port this winter. The trunk lines, under the circumstances, no longer have the excuse that they cannot advance rates on export business on account of the Portland rates. , ? President McKeen has his annual report for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31 nearly ready for the press. His report win show that the earn ings of the road the last year were the largest in the history of the road. The V andalia main line has been operated on b4 per cent, of the gross earnings, and the T. IL & I. division on 68 per cent i he election or u. ti. otter to the presi dency of both the Chicago & Eastern Illinois road and the Chicago & Indiana Coal road, and the placing of H. H. Stevens in the directory of both, confirms the belief that the two interests are to be operated as one, and will combine to secure possession of the Evansville & Terre Haute road. H. Robinson, of Buffalo, N. Y.. general East ern agent of the Delawaie, Lackawanna & West ern, and Mr. Jenkins, general Western agent. are in me city tor tne purpose ot becomme ac quainted with the business men. This line is bunding up a large freight traffic from this sec tion, ana in tne eariy spring win be in this field xor its snare or tne tnrougn east-oonna passen ger business. Work on the C, I., St. L. & C. cut-off at North Bend is progressing finely. The weather has enabled the contractors to push the work and it will probably be completed in the early spring. a couple of months earlier than has been antici pated. -The improvement is now so far advanced that were the tunnel to fill with water, or any other thing occur to prevent its use, trains could be run over the cut-otf. - - One railway president has succeeded in out generaling young Ives. J. H. Wade, president of the Cincinnati. Wabash & Michigan, received from Ives $450,000 on an alleged purchase of the road and when be found out that Ives would not meet the remaining payments, he placed the money he received into betterments of the road and now the entire line, fifteen miles excepted. is laid with heavy steel rail and there are sever al new engines and additional freight and pas senger equipments. Members of the Indianapolis division of the Brotherhond'of Locomotive Engineers are very confident that Congress will take favorable action on a bill which has been prepared at the suggestion of the - brotherhood, providing for the licensing of railway conductors and engin- ders, and prohibiting anyroad employing any person to serve in such eapaoity unless he is licensed as provided in the act The hill, in short, provides for examiners who shall inquire into the character, habits of life and qualifica tionf of the applicant, and as to his mental and physical ability. Eight months ago, about the time that the interstate-commerce law was a fixed fact, a high official on an Indianapolis line conceived the idea that property on the lake ports would greatly increase in value through the workings of the law, and persuaded a very successful railroad attorney of this eitv to join hands with bim, and they inyested $12,000 in real estate in UuiutD. within the last sixty days they have sold one-half of their purchase at just four times as much money as they paid for the whole, and the remaining half will probably be sold to even better profit Some eighteen months ago the C. I.. St L. & C. , in connection with the Baltimore & Ohio road, established a fast-freight line to do busi ness between Chicago and the seaboard, via In dianapolis and Cincinnati, to be known as the B. &. O Kankakee dispatch. The results have been very gratifying. The C, I., St L. & G. hich bad formerly no east-bound business out of Chicago, has been carrying about 6 per eeut of it, and has built up a heavy traffic in con nection with the C. & R. L, via Seneca, and at the same time has doubled the west-bound throueh tonnare of the C. I., St L. & C One month the line handled 1.528 loaded cars. Miscellaneous Items. On ooe of the Mexican roads they are testing steel cross-ties against wooden ties. After a re-. cent freshet it was found that the track laid on wooden ties was washed away and badly, torn np, and on the part laid with steel ties only the gravel ballast was washed . out; all the rest of the roadway was intaet ' A bridge over the Connecticut river, which eost the Connecticut River road $S5.000, has just been completed. The bridge is 1,500 feet long. The New York Central's first vestibule train arrived in Chicago last night, and the Lake Shore people gave a grands banquet to the lead ing railroad and business men of that city in honor of the event v . The Cincinnati, Jackson & Maekinaw road is completed between Bryan and Addison. Mich., thus uniting their Ohio and Michigan divisions. This road uses forty-four miles of the C, H. & D. to get into Cincinnati. Officers of the Pullman Car Company say that the darnings of the sleeping-car lines are run ning $2,000 a day ahead of those of the corre sponding period in 1886. Much of this increase is due to the heavy travel to the Pacific coast The Boston & Lowell road will next week put on their line one of the new Swinerton locomo tives. This engine has bnt one set of large driving-wheels, with over 100 facets or straight sides on the tire in order to secure greater trac tion power. There are no ontside parallel rods. which does away with the danger of running at high speed around curves. The mountain extension ef the Colorado Mid land road, just opened for business, is said to have the grandest scenery in the world. The highest grade is on nearly the same elevation as the top of 1'iKe's Peak, while the road runs along on the top of the Mosquito. range of mountains 9,800 feet above the level of the sea, and on the Sangaucbe mountains 11,800 feet above.

SHOULD BE PROMOTED. Suggestions of President Furnas for Increas ing the Horticultural Society's Uesfulness. The session of the Indiana Horticultural So ciety, yesterday morning, was opened with paper from Dr. Allan Furnas, of Danville, the newly-elected president, on the problem of in creasing the usefulness of the society. He gave his opinion that the first duty Of every member of the society was to become thoroughly interested in the work himself, and then to do all he can to interest others. It was not enough to attend annual meet ings, mere should be work between time, and an ad interim committee should be ap pointed to investigate and agitate. State farm - era institutes should be held, as in other States, and if the Agricnltural Society will not look after the matter the Horticultural Society could afford to make a movement in that direc tion. 1 bere should be some means adopted to promote a generous rivalry between the coun ties in their horticultural work, such as a pre sentation of a banner to the most deserving, and also a summer meeting of the society for the inspection of summer fruits and the best modes of cultivating them. More attention should be given to ornamental gardening, and. in tbts connection especially, ladies should be given a greater share in the work of the society. a general discussion followed, in which it was strongly urged by several members that more effort should be made to induce ladies to attend the meetings and take interest in the work of the society. The fact that no lady had a place on tne programme of the present meeting was referred to and criticised. . It was urged that members should bring their wives to the meet ings, as several lad ies had come to the doors and turned back because they saw no other ladies present . Resolutions were introduced and adopted pro viding that a certificate of merit be awarded to the originator of new horticultural products: that a banner be presented to the county bring ing the largest number of members to the next meeting; that a special summer meeting be arranged for, and that the next annual meeting oe neia at lnoianapoiis. Ihe following resolu tion concerning the State Library was adopted: Whereas, Agriculture is the most important in dustry of the State, of Indiana, and the material in terest of the great majority of the people would be much enhanced by having access to the standard works on the various subjects connected therewith. uu aiso oy receiving ximeiy in r or ma ion ot all im provements and diseoveries in the science of agri culture; ana i Whereas, The State Library of Indiana, which Was designed to furnish the people access to the best and highest information on all the practical questions of life, has received for many years an annual prrv.. priation of only $IUU tor the purchase and binding oi oooks, in consequence ot wnicn modern authorities have not been purchased, agricultural serials have not been subscribed for, and many books already ia the library have been permitted to fall to pieces; Resolved, That it is the duty of the Legislature to make more liberal provision for the purchase and binding of books for the future, and especially ought tne Legislature to make an appropriation at its nest session sumcient to remedy the worst exisiting de fects of the library; and, Kesolred, That with increasing- appropri&lions it would be advisable to provide a purchasing board to supervise the expenditures of this nature: and that n. board composed, according to the plan proposed by the iuuinua xj.iLoricai oociety si ine last session ot the Legislature, of the Governor, State Superintendent of Public Instruction and Librarian ex officio, with one member to be appointed by the Supreme Court, and one by tne Indiana Historical " JSoeiety, would meet tee approval of this society. Kesolved, farther, that a delegate from this so eietv be anoomtad bv the rrif!nnt. in nini ),; matter to the proper committee of the Legislature. Sylvester Johnson was appointed delegate in accordance with this provision. A committee composed of Messrs. Furnas, Johnson, Troop, RatUff and Kingsbury, was appointed to visit the various parts of the State in the interest of the society during the coming year. IT 

PLEASES-FREE-TRADERS. Significant Comments on the Tariff Reform Message of President Cleveland. The President's message was being variously commented upon yesterday by a party of gentlemen, when Major John B. Glover, consul to Havre under the last Republican administra tion, said: "I was abroad during all of the last campaign, and in no instance did I find an Englishman or Frenchman who did not espouse Cleveland's election. Many of them were with ns on all other questions except that concerning the tariff. No Democrats in this country could have been more earnest in their support of Cleveland. He was looked upon as the leader f free trade under the euise of tariff reform. They regarded that as one great step in the direction of a policy that would redound to the benefit of England and France. Going from London to Liverpool, I was in a compart ment with a wealthy and influential iron master who - had traveled extensively in the United States. He said no iron country can be de veloped under free trade and come into com petition with ' England. AVe can supply you with manufactured articles,' he remarked, 'and take in turn your grain: but if I was an American I would bo on the side of protection.' Yhen it was announced that Cleveland was elected, the English and French were as Jubilant almost as his adherents on this side. ''There is nothing new in the messace. Its arguments for tariff reform are preciselv those used by the free-trade Democrats since the time Henry Clay was the great apostle of protection. They tell the farmer, as they did then, you can under tariff reform sell vour wheat in Liverpool, buy your plows there and pay freight both for what you sell and what you buy. . une uemocrats hero accept the messaee without any desire to question its argu ments as denning the position of their party next year. One of them, of some prominence, was so elated on his first readme:, as to sav: "It is just the thing the partv needs. Since Jackson's time we have not had an issue, but the message means that we are to be placed squarely on a platform of reduction in revenue. I disclaim, though, that it points to free trade." Another said: "I am a free-trader theoretic ally, but I do not favor it as a political issue just now. Reduction in revenue is sufficient for the time being. After a while the opportunitv will no doubt come when we can take squarely a position in support of free trade. Protection is popular because it is what every new country needs. The present generation will see no lessening of strength hi' that doctrine, but I believe the people aro ready to aect-pt tariff reform. It gives us something to fight for. although it may not go as far as the extreme freetraders desire." Altogether the message is looked " upon as good enough Democratic doctrine until the party thinks it can uncover its ulterior purposes. No Doubt of It. Pittsburg Chronicle.
