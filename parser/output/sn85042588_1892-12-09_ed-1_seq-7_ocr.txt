BENJAMIN HARRISON. Senate. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—A most unusual incident in the proceedings of the senate was the offering of an opening prayer by the Jewish Rabbi, Rev. Dr. Joseph Silverman, Rabbi of Temple Manuel New York. Mr. Hill (democrat, .New York) in­ troduced a bill to repeal the Sherman silver purchase act. Referred to com­ mittee on finances. Petitions for and against the anti option bill poured in upon the senate to-day, and nearly all the southern states were represented. The petitions covered the country from Delaware to Texas, Bhowing systematic work on the part of the opponents of the bill. It is clear that the south is against the anti option measure, and that its prospect of passage becomes poorer. Senators Washburn, Hansbrough and Allen presented petitions for the bill, but those on the other side outnumbered them ten to one. The Benate at 1:15 adjourned, after the announcement of the death of the late representative, McDonald, New Jersey, by Senator McPherson. The St. Paul Weekly Pioneer Press will be better this year than ever. The Bismarck Weekly TRIBUNE one year and the Pioneer Press one year—both for $2.75 cash in advance.

BISMARCK WEEKLY TRIBUNE: FRIDAY. DEC. 9 1892 OFFICIAL VOTE OF NORTH DAKOTA BY COUNTIES.---1892. Lieutenant Addresses a Typical Bismarck Audi Last Evening at the Atheneum, And Speaks on the Misrepresentations of Catholicism Which Often Prevail. He Is an Entertaining and Logical Speaker and Hakes an Excel­ lent Impression. How Catholicism Is Misrepresented* The Atheneum was well filled last Monday with persons who were present to hear Bishop Shanley speak on the misrepresentation of Catholicism. The mayor and city council had seats on the stage, and also Father Martin. Th9 bishop was introduced by the mayor with the following words: "I have the pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, to introduced the Right Reverend Bishop Shanley of North Dakota, who will now favor us with one of his most eloquent lectures." The bishop took exception to the ad­ jective used in his introduction, and said his effort was dignified when termed a lecture, claiming it was simply to be a social talk. A talk of a society that had existed for over four centuries, existed in every land and clime where ever lan­ guage was used. A society that was as strong a hundred years ago as now. In its membership was contained the ablest and wisest scholars, and also many who could not read or write. The society was ruled over by one Leo. The bishop went on to give in a general way some historical faots in regard to the church. He said that Catholicism had been misrepresented by the news­ papers, by many of the great authors, and by many who pretened to be schol­ ars, and that it was for the refutation of these falsehoods he was there to address the audience. The bishop said there were two kinds of lies, the material lie, and the formal lie. The material lie was one made unknowingly, and the formal lie known to be a falsehood. Whioh kind of lies were those scattered broadcast about Catholicism he did not know, but they were lies just the same. Many persons, he continued, believe Catholicism to teach that all persons who do not belong to the Catholic church are doomed to everlasting damnation. This he characterized as an utter falsehood, either ignorant or ma­ licious. Catholicism, he went on, teaohes that all persons who endeavor to serve God, as they believe He should be served, will find reward in heaven, and that it teaches also, that only two per­ sons are known to be in bell, Dives and Judas. Beyond this all was conjeoture. As to the general belief that priests oan forgive sins, and that they are paid by the seeker after forgiveness, the bishop said he admitted the first part.. Priests act as mediators between God and men they are the recog­ nized successors of the apostles of Christ, and as such are em­ powered to forgive sins. But he, who seeks forgiveness must be truly and sincerely repentant. And as to the second part of the belief he said it was wickedly false. Persons who think that priests have a regular tariff for forgiving sins—swear words, $1.50, or six for $5 lies, 10 cents staying away from ohurch, 98 getting drank, 50 cents, and so on— were ignorant and labored under a mis­ apprehension. Of many other popularly ridioulous beliefs he spoke. The pope, said he, was the head of the ohtuoh, as all societies have a head. He wius the recognized suoceeeor of Peter, and aa pooh was empowered to settle all dis- secretary of Btate Governor. State. rt Btate Hnpt. of Public I ns traction Auditor. Treasurer.

CatholicB believed him infallible on churoh matters, on other matters he was liable to err as is any other human being The bishop, is an entertaining talker, and from his standpoint made an excel­ lent address. He has a' fluent command of language, and is witty in his dis course. And it would not do him jus tice were it not said that his address was well received and left a good impression wherever it was heard. Knights of Pythias. The election of officers for the en­ suing term occurred last Monday. The following were elected: Chancellor commander, John Har court vice-chancellor, R. H. Tenny prelate, Geo. E. Wentworth keeper of records and seals, J. W. Mansfield master of finance, Frank Kihiii master of exchequer, Morris Eppinger master at-arms, Henry Semling inner guard, Wm. Falconer outer guard, Wm. Pen nell. The Daly Court Martial. The St. Paul Globe of Saturday pub­ lishes an account of the Daly court martial at Ft. Yates, in which it deliv­ ers an unreserved roast to everyone who sat in the court martial. The Pioneer Press of Sunday says in reply thereto: Much indignation was felt at army head­ quarters here yesterday when the article was read concerning the court martial of Sergeant William Daly at Ft. Yates, which was published in yesterday morning's Globe. The article charges that the regular army officers go into extremes in prefer­ ring charges against subordinates, and cites the case of Dell Wild, about whom so much newspaper talk was made two years ago. It then goes on so say, "It appears that Lieut. Day 'had it in' for Daly and pre­ ferred charges against him, alleging drunkenness and disobedience. Of course, the court martial found him guilty. Courts martial, composed of com­ missioned officers, always convict the men in the ranks but, when the proceedings canie before Gen. Merritt for review, he reversed the findings and roasted the court in the followim language." Here follows the general's review of the court martial of Sergeant Daly, in which he states that "the latitude of investigation and comment by the defense, permitted by the court is deemed to exceed anything justified by the custom of the service or the demands of justice. For these and other reasons not necessary to enumerate, findings and sen­ tence are disapproved." The facts in the case are that the offense for which Sergeant Daly was court mar tialed was a very slight one and the pun ishment would have been light. Much unnecessary time was taken up by the court martial in adducing testimony that was entirely uncalled for and irrelevant to the case in hand, and of this the general disapproved. Notice. A special meeting of- the stockholders of the Fairview Cemetery association will be held at the office of the secretary, Saturday, December 10th, at 2 p. m., for the purpose of electing a new president, and transacting any other business that may, come before them. By order of Joan 

STEUTHEBS, P. B. WEBB, President. Secretary. Jack the Horse Killer. North Dakota seems to be afflicted with a Jack the horse killer. Not long ago the Niche Oak Leaf chronicled the cutting of a Y-shaped section out of a horse's belly by some miscreant, and now the Lisbon Star reports the shoot­ ing of six horses by some unknown per­ son, presumably for revenge. The mutil­ ation or killing of a horse for the sake of revenge upon its owner denotes bru­ tality and utter ignor&nce, to say the least. nan Disputes His Check—And Loses. A Sioux Falls special to the Pioneer Press says: In July, 1890, Dan Scott, a newspaper man of thiB city, whom everybody in the state knows very favorably, had not taken the Keeley treatment, but he had taken a trip to St. Paul.. While there he indulged in potations wnich rendered him unable to decide rightly what he was doing. On the evening of July 24th Dan fell into bad company. He was surrounded, as he claims, by a lot of gamblers, who induced him to go into a faro game. Dan lost a gold watch and chain and 8160 in money, but still kept at work in the tiger's den. Before the night was over be had drawn two checks, one for $80 and the other for 840, to bearer. The next day Dan came to himself and wired the Dakota sNational I ,** V"1 Commis- Attorney sioner of Commissioners of Railroads. Everybody in Bismarck knows Dan Scott, who was with the 

TBIBUNE in the early days. He was an all around good fellow, and a sport, and no matter how much he had dropped on the faro table, would never then have disputed or re­ fused payment on one of his own checks. Dan seems to have changed olden tyme." A Krioaltore Labor. 19BS8 15339 16500 18274 (HEY WASH THEIR CLOTHES WITH TTEWL,eRll?EYS'E"L'ELFSI"E' MADE ONLY BY N.K.FAIRBANK8CCO. CHICAGO. day, J. E.

The course of true love never did run smooth. A little more foolishness and the chances for an appropriation will have disappeared. Regarding the above the Grand Forks Herald promptly says: "If a man at­ tempts tb make trouble for the World's Fair board, shoot him ou the spot. That there are outside parties who would be glad to embarrass the board even to the extent of defeating a further appropria­ tion and bringing discredit upon the state and its exhibit is more than in timaled, and The Herald hopeB they will desist. However, the Republican will note that only the Argus re-echoes the idle stories of a democratic sheet that there is trouble within the board, stories which the secretary of the board expressly denies. A Pleasing and Auspicious Dedication. The dedication hall at Valley City was crowded Tuesday night with persons who were present to witness the dedi­ catory exercises of the normal school. It was probably the largest crowd which has ever assembled in that city, many persons being unable to gain admittance to the building. The exercises were begun with music and the usual opening ceremdmes, and after this followed ad­ dresses from a number of the invited guests. State Superintendent Ogden was the first to respond, and he was fol lrwed by President Lord of Mcorhead. Governor-elect Shortrjdge was in attend­ ance and delivered a pleasing address. Mr. Shortridge was followed by Presi­ dent Merrifield of the state university, who spoke briefly and appropriately. President Stockbridge of the state'agri­ cultural college, also responded, as did Mrs. Eisenhuth, the newly elected super­ intendent of publio instruction, Miss Bates of the May ville normal school, J. M. Devine and Messrs. Kinter, Hodgson and Bierly. President Heidel of the board of man­ agement, presented a report of the finanoes of the institution, and after a bank to stop payment on the checks. Fri- tew remarks handed over the keys to principal thoroughfares of the oity. s, the principal. The formal dedicatory address was then made by State Super­ intendent Ogden. In the evening the invited guests were banqueted by the citizens of Valley City. The banquet was thoroughly enjoyable, the spread Epicurean in every respeot, and not until midnight did the guests disperse. ,, Of the newly elected state officials there were present. Gov. Shortridge, State Auditor Porter, State Treasurer Nomland and Railroad Commissioner. Stevens. Rev. McNaughton of Mayville, was unable to be present and sent his regrets. The Valley City normal schbol opens very auspiciously. The membership already numbers upwards of ninety, and the institution gives promise of being a thriving educational factor. Tills Is All KiKllt. The Jamestown Alert editor had a talk with Governor-elect Shortridge and says: "He seemed in the best of spirits and health and said he enjoyed his re­ cent trip to Missouri very much. It was his first visit to his old home in nearly teu years, and friends in the city of Macon gave himself and wife a reception which was most gratifying. Mrs. Short­ ridge will remain with relatives there for t.he present, and possibly until spring, though that will depend upon the gov­ ernor's success in securing' a suitable residence at Bismarck. Mr. Shortridge says he has not yet visited the capital since election, and in fact it has been eleven years since he was there. He says it is his intention to reside at the capital, however, during his term of office, and he believes all the new officials will do the same, being thus enabled to better perform their duties."
