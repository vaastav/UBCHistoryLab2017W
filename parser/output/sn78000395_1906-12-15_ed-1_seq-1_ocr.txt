Call Is Issued For Convention of Washington State Federa­ tion of Labor. Spokane, Wash., Dec. 13—Charles D. Raymer, candidate for member­ ship on the Spokane board of edu­ cation, expresses himself in favor of teachers forming a union affilia­ ted with other labor unions of the city. He said in this connection: "I am of the opinion that more of actual practice in the public schools would be of benefit to those insti­ tutions. I look upon the kinder­ garten and manual training depart­ ments as invaluable toward the training of the young mind for its encounter with the practicable bat­ tles of life. I have not thorough­ ly investigated th£ fraternities in the schools of Spokane but will say from what I know of such organ aations generally that I do not be­ lieve they are a good thing for pub­ lic school children. I stand for the highest possible wages that can consistently be paid to every work­ er, especially the teacher, who has much to do with forming the char­ acter of the child immediately un­ der his or her control." State Federation of Labor. Call for the state federation of labor of Washington to meet at Bellingham Jan. 2, will be issued in a few days. In years when the state legislature meets it is custo­ mary for the federation to meet about a week or 10 days prior to the date set for the first session of the state legislature, which will con­ vene Jan. 10, next year. Matters pertaining to proaesed legislation will be the chief thing to come be­ fore the convention. Women Clerks Organizing. After the first of the year the women clerks in Spokane will be Invited to join the clerks union and an active canvass will be made to take every woman into membership. As many extra clerks ar$ now em­ ployed by the stores and a number of these will be released after the holiday rush it was deemed inad­ visable to secure the membership of the women at this time. It is stated that many of them have, how­ ever, expressed a willingness to join the union. John E. Lincoln, secretary of the union, has resigned and will go east. His successor has !Vi not yet been named.. Cement- Workers lighting. A movement to force the recog nition of the cement workers' union by the structural building trades al­ liance in Spokane, has been set on foot, and it is believed that before the close of the year the cement workers will be a part of the build­ ing trades body. It is reported that the question of the recognition of the cement I workers here has been taken up by the question with the American Federation of Labor. I Union Labor Party. The formation of a union la or party by the various organizatons in Spokane is being discussed and it is likely a ticket will be named for the municipal election next spring. A number of unions have already taken up the matter and the sentiment appears to be in favor of securing a labor candidate to make the fight on that issue and have the solid labor vote behind him. Telephone Company Scrap. Spokane union men say that the Home Telephone company will not be allowed to make peace with the labor organizations until it agrees to live up to the contract which former President Sumner is said to have signed with the unions. It is also declared that reports that a settlement had been reached in Ta coma and Portland are untrue, and that until the company is placed upon the fair list here no settle­ ment will be reached elsewhere. With Dolan's Organization. Local unions of the International Brotherhood of Steam Shovel and Dredge Men have been established in Spokane and Vancouver, and headquarters in Spokane, Seattle and Portland, by S. J. Dolan, secretary and treasurer of the order, who has gone to Portland, Cal., to organize a local branch. J. L. Humphrey, who is in charge of the work of get­ ting members for this district, has just returned from a 15-days' trip j^- over railroad and construction work, and says that two-thirds of the men he met are now members and that by Jan. 1, 1907, the average will reach nine-tenths. For Progressive Legislation. .'V Among the many measures to be proposed during the coming session of the Washington legislature the following will be conspicuous: Primary election law. Congres sional apportionment. Liberal ap­ propriation for the Alaska-Yukon exposition. Depository laws that will enable state, county and muni­ cipal funds to earn Interest on daily cash balances. Regulation of state banks through an examiner. Co­ operation with the national govern­ ment for geodetic and geologic sur- veys. Revision of the state fund system so that all taxes, fees, fines and licenses can be applied through the general fund. Application of the gross earnings tax principle, on that capitalized earnings tax, to all corporations enjoying state prlvil eges to lessen the burden of direct tax for state purposes. Consolidat­ ed bureau of Information, statistics and accountancy to be administered under an expert to be appointed by the governor. Compact board of state officers to supervise constant­ ly the state and public school finan­ ces and enforce the depositary laws. More 'practical and efficient good roads law. Investment of all per­ manent educational funds, and con­ version of the capital land grant debt. Provisions for two years, in­ vestigation of the management of public lands and the public school funds. Kill 

MORE In Twelve Days There Are More Men Killed Than Were Lost in the Philippines. Dr. Josiah Strong Shows Deadli ness of Our Modern In­ dustrial Juggernaut. "Taking the lowest of our three estimates of industrial accidents, the total number of casualties suffered by our industrial army in one year is equal to the average annual cas­ ualties of our civil war, plus those of the Philippine war, plus those of the Russian and Japanese war. "Think of our carrying on three such wars at the same time world without end!" This is the rather startling way in which Dr. Josiah Strong, presi­ dent of the American Institute of Social Service, emphasizes the fear­ ful sacrifice of life to "Our Indus trail Juggernaut." The comparison between the loss of life in the industries and in the war fails, of course, at one point. War is altogether destructive, while the industries give something in re­ turn for the lives taken. Dr. Strong at the outset of his article in the North American Re­ view calls attention to the fact that, while the railroad casualties attract a great deal of attention, they ar* only a small proportion of the cas­ ualties that take place in the in­ dustrial world. "It is important to gain some idea of the great numbers who are annually sacrificed by accidents in our American industries," says Dr. Strong, "As compared with Euro­ pean governments, our state legis­ latures have generally been strange­ ly indifferent to the whole subject. The laws of only eleven of our states require the reporting of ac­ cidents in factories and a careful examination reveals but a single state whose laws require the report­ ing of accidents in all industries." 'Working iicrwever, from data "de­ rived from widely divergent sources, Dr. Strong shows the minimum num­ ber of industrial accidents in this country in a year must be consider­ ably more than 500,000. "When in all history," he asks, "have two great armies been able to inflict on each other a total of half million casualties in a single year? This is 50 per cent more than all the killed and wounded in the late between Japan and Russia. There are more casualties on our railways in a single year than there were on both sides of the Boer war in three years. Last year on our railways we I killed as many every thirty-seven days and wounded as many every twelve days as all our killed and wounded in the 2,561 engagements of the Philippine war. Or, in other words, there were twenty-four times as many casualties on our railways in one year as our army suffered in the Philippine war in three years and three months. At that rate we might have con­ tinued the war for seventy-eight years before equaling the record of our railways in a twelve-month. And we must not forget that less than one-fifth of the losses of our industrial army are suffered on our railways. That is to say, we -might carry on a half dozen Philippine wars for three-quarters of a century with no larger number of casualties than take place yearly in our peace­ ful industries. "We are waging a perpetual war on humanity," says Dr. Strong, "and one which is apparently growing bloodier from year to year." He quotes government statistics to show that on the railroads, to a given number of passengers, there were twice as many killed in 1905 as in 1895, and continues: 'Europe is far in advance of America in protecting workmen from needless accidents both by legislation and by safety appliances The association of French Indus­ trialists for the Prevention of Acci­ dents, by reason of its varied and beneficent activities, was declared to be of 'public utility' as long ago as 1887. There was a general Ex­ position of Accident Prevention in Germany in 1889. Immediately af­ ter its close there was organized in Vienna a Museum of Security and of Industrial Hygiene. "There are now half a dozen such museums in Europe, one having been organized in Paris, last December and formally opened by the presi­ dent of the republic. Even back­ ward Russia shames us by her Mu­ seum of Security at Moscow. Aus­ tria has had a score of expositions of safety appliances for the educa­ tion of the people. "Governments and public-spirited citizens have vied with each other in providing funds for such insti­ tutions. Here the greatest of all in­ dustrial peoples has attempted lit­ tle by legislation and nothing by organized effort.

Tells How Speaker Cannon Can Overthrow Will of People, and Block Laws. H. R. Fuller, national legislative rep­ resentative for the Brotherhood of Lo­ comotive Firemen rather takes a jolt or two out of Speaker Cannon in a review on late labor legislation. He says: "To the great Burprise of the railroad organizations who have been working for years for a law restricting immigration by an educational test, the United States senate at its recent session passed such a bil ,not only to be crucified in what has been supposed to be the house of his friends. After the bill containing' the educa­ tional test provision had been report­ ed from committee, efforts were made by its friends to secure from Speaker J. G. Cannon an opportunity for its consideration in the house. Mr. Can­ non being violently, opposed to the educational test provision, would not consent, and in order to sound the sen­ timents of the members of his party in the House on the subject, he order­ ed the Republican "whip," Represen­ tative J. E. Watson of Indiana, to take a poll of the Republican members. Acording to statements made by Mr. Watson, this poll developed the fact that the sentiment on that side of the House was strongly in favor of the educational test, much to the chagrin of Mr. Cannon. If the majority of the party in control of the House ruled, this would have been sufficient, but Mr. Cannon, with a ruthless disregard for the wishes of a majority of his party, still continued to use the in­ fluence and power of his office to de­ feat this provision. Representative Gardner of Mass­ achusetts then secured a sufficient number of signature? of the Republi­ can members to call a Republican caucus for the purpose of considering the subject. Mr. Ca.nnon was apprised of this fact, and fearing if a caucus was called his efforts would be de­ feated and the educational test provi­ sion passed, begged of the friends of the bill to not press their caucus call, and he would- have a rule, providing for its consideration, brought in by the committee on rules. Unfortunately Mr. Cannon's proposition was accepted, for, together with his confidential ad­ visors, he set about to frame, a rule through which the-defeat of this pro vision could ^be aepomplislifd. Qn June 25th the rule was reported to the House by Representative John Dal zell of Pennsylvania, and adopted. It prevented an aye and nay vote on the educational test provision, and pro­ vided for the offering of a substitute therefor which would require that the subject be submitted to a com­ mission. The object of preventing this substitute was wholly for the pur­ pose of evading the question, and for furnishing a means for defeating the educational teat without requiring members to answer to their consti­ tuents for a direct vote against it. The bill was then taken up for con« sideration, and passed according to Mr. Cannon's program and for the first time probably within the recollec« tlon of any member of the House, or the oldest of its frequenters, the spec­ tacle was witnessed of the speaker maintaining his place on the floor, log­ rolling against a measure which had. been declared for in platforms of Re­ publican national conventions and in inaugural addreses and messages of Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt, and by his presence, leadership and force, intimidating Republicans who were otherwise inclined to vote their real sentiments. The substitute providing for a refer­ ence of the subject to a commission, was offered by Representative C. H. Grosvenor of Ohio, the speaker's right hand man, and second in command of the House leadership. A division was had on this substitute ,and it was de­ clared defeated by a vote of 13G to 123 a majority of 13. This showed that! notwithstanding all the coercion and unfair means resorted to by Mr. Can­ non, still the majority of the House was in favor of the educational test provision, and against the cowardly underhanded way by which it was proposed to defeat it but such a de­ feat to the speaker could not be al­ lowed to stand, his friends demanded tellers, and among the first to go be­ tween the tellers and be counted in favor of the substitute was Mr. Can­ non himself. As soon as he passed the tellers his piercing eye ran rapidly over the Republican side of the cham­ ber and a frown took possession of his face when he beheld many mem­ bers of his party quietly sitting in their seats waiting for the other side of the question to be taken, when they could cast their votes in favor of the educational test. He then became des­ perate, shaking his head vigorously and gesticulating with his arms he worked rapidly from one- desk to (railroading and mining) of a given number of men employed we kill and injure from two to nine times as many as they do in Europe. "ThiB industrial slaughter is utter waste—wasted resources, wasted an­ guish, wasted life. And although the greater part of this sacrifice is as needless as it is useless, it goes wearily, on year after year. The price of our selfish indifference is never paid. "It .is well to end the barbarities of war. Is it not time to place some limit to the barbarities of peace,"

1CE-EM« II SOUTHERN MILLS 'Mother" Jones Writes Stirring Article on Iniquities of Child Labor in South. Cotton Mills Produce a Type of Children Easily Recognized As Most Puny. (By "Mother" Jones.) After thirten years of absence I re­ turned to see what improvements bad been made in the industrial conditions of the piili workers of the sunny south. I found that there had been marvel­ ous progress made as far as the millB and machinery were concerned. Look­ ing at the advancement In that line, one would think that the day of rest for the workers must be near. Instead of bringing rest and leisure to the workers, however, this perfected ma­ chinery brings only a more merciless exploitation than was ever practiced before. With the advancement in ma­ chinery has come a coresponding ad­ vance in the methods of exploitation. That is all the difference the improve­ ments have made upon the worekrs. I stood orte morning in the early dawn and I watched the slaves as they entered the pen of capitalism. I could see the shadows of the slaves passing along in the brush to the mill at twenty minutes to six in the morning. Children, roused from the heavy sleep of youth, left their beds reluctantly and entered the institution of capit­ alism to create weatlth for others to enjoy. The mill at Graham, N. C., has been built but four years. In that time they have doubled the size of the mill and its machinery, and in addition to this they have paid forty per cent dividends to the stockholders each year. I watched the workers, young and old, who had produced all this wealth, when the machinery stopped at noon. They returned to the shack which they call home, scraped together what was left from breakfast, ate it for lunch in a mad hurry, and then they drifted back again to their posts. It brought to my mind the tread-mill punishment with which the tyran­ nical government of England tortured her victims only eighty years ago. These mill children are allowed only forty minutes for dinner. Then they stand before that iron giant until twenty minutes of seven at night. I asked myself what progress had there been in the conditions of these work­ ers? I saw only tragedies everywhere. The lives of the men, women and chil­ dren who produce the clothing, for. the people of the land arelfolng^trag edies." Under the miU-eicieff^bf ."jSSSSit^ chusetts hearts are breaking from Overwork and poor food, just as they, are under the mill-skies of the sunny South. So exhausting is the work that something must be done to com­ bat the existing state of affairs. The workers are old long before they are old in years. They are old before they have had a chance to get their growth. The machine has become al­ most human and the child has become a machine. In Columbia, S. C., a splendid illus­ tration of benevolent feudalism may be observed. On one side of the streets is a great mill, occupying a whole block. Up the street is the school building. Opposite is the church with its steeple pointing up to the throne of God to proclaim the wonderful work being carried on in His name. Nearby, too, is the repair shop, called the "accident ward." Here baby fingers are amputated and man­ gled arms and legs and broken heads are repaired, with what care and skill the company doctor sees fit to call to his aid. The thought in the mind of this mechanic, the doctor, is to adjust the living bolts and to so repair the throbbing, fevered parts, that the ma­ chine may go back again to the mill to create more wealth for the master. If the case is too badly injured to give promise of service, little interest is taken and it is simply a case for the junk-heap of our industrial life. If there happens to be something the matter with the "morals" of these living machines, the services of the sanctified machinist are called into activity. With threats on one hand of eternal hell and on the other hand of eternal blessings, to play the golden harp in the world beyond, this moral mechanic does what he can to render this member useful in creating wealth. To those of us who would better these conditions these sky pilots say, "Your thoughts and plans are of this earth —worldly. Miine are higher, they point upward they are 'other world­ ly.' I point from this world as it is to the heavenly world which is to repay the poor for their suffering if they bear it in patience now." And for centuries the poor deluded work­ ers have been kept from their birth­ right here, but they are waking up. The work of making the clothing for the world's Inhabitants is now so highly specialized that chlldrwen do -most of the spinning while the weav­ ing is done by men and women. A suck shuttle loom pays the weav­ er fifteen cents per cut for twelve hours' work. In order to make wages the worker must watch several ma­ chines. "When everything runs smoothly," said a woman who is fai above the average in intelligence and skill, "I can make a dollar and fifty cents a day. But you know things don't always go smoothly. And it it hard for a woman to stand on her feet thirteen hours every day. We can't stand it all the time, and so $1.60 is more than the average weaver gets." In the spinning rooms the children are paid ten cents on an average fo: watching a "siding." Some very nlm ble little ones manage to take cart .V'V"'"" -v'V »v. AL of eight sidings, but they are physical wrecks in a few years. The whirr of the passing threads becomes a part of their whole mental and physical make-up. I saw a little" boy dying of typhoid fever, and in his ravings he was tying the knots of the spindles. ''Oh, I wish I'd get ahother siding!" A TT 1011 1 eCl AUU^llVl OIUU15 he was orylng. "This don't work, and the boss will be mad and I will lose my job." In his death struggle this little child felt the sword of the capi­ talist over him- This little victim of our brutal system died and the "new siding" which the fates had in store for him could not have been as cruel as the one he left behind for his little brothers to watch. The cotton mill produces a type that can't be mistaken anywhere. An un der-sixed boy, a narrow chest, a shift­ ing and uncertain gait, an expression­ less face, and a soul that hopes not, for there is nought in the cotton mill worker's life but the long hours of toil,, repulsive food, bare walls, and at the close a hole in the ground. Death can hold no horrors greater than their lives have known. The mill owners are not only the employers of labor, but they are land­ lords, the merchants, the school dir­ ectors, the patent medicine venders and the Salvation Army soul-savers. On every side of him the worker feels the "touch" of his employer. As school director, for Instance, the Infamy of the employer's greed blocks the pathway of the future of the lit­ tle child. A rule is made and strictly adhered to that a child who is absent a certain number of days during a term can not be promoted into the next higher class, even though the studies have been carefully kept up and the child is ready to take an ex­ amination to prove his fitness for pro­ motion. The hard and fast rule is carried out from year to year and at last parents and children, too, become discouraged and the door of the school house closes behind the child and the mill door swings open to receive its prey, never to give It up until death seals its ears to the whirr of the spin­ dles and the looms. During the last session of the legislature in South phorten the hours of labor from twelve to ten. The mill owners got a few of their workmen before the legislative committee who made a plea for the "business' interests." They insisted that they could not make a living un­ less they ran at least twelve hours per day. The bill was pigeon-holed. To make sure of its case the company sent a petition around the mill district asking the voting mill hands to sign it for a continuance of the twelve-hour day. I saw a man prepare to sign it, but hlq wife said, "No, ten hours, even is too much!" "But we'll lose our job!" he cried In dismay. "I tell you even ten hours is too long to spend in those pens!" she insisted and the man did not sign. Mothers have far more of the revolutionary spirit 'VaWA AMM1 it t_ A South Carolina passed a law pro­ hibiting the employment of children under the age of twelve. As always happens, the mill owner stood by and out of the kindness of his heart, made provision for the children of the widow and of the invalid or the un­ fortunate. Th}s admits all but the children of the well-to-do. In many cases the parents have turned out ex­ ploiters and have sworn that they were unable to support their children. During my stay in Columbia lately a boy of nine fell into an elevator shaft and was killed. His mother drew his pay. The press statement declared the boy to have been above the age of twelve and insisted that he was not In the employ of the com­ pany that day. On such technicali­ ties the employer evades the law. A shrewd scheme shows the mill owner as landlord. He will not rent his tenements or his cottages unless the family can furnish a worker in the mill for every room in the dwell­ ing. "Teddy had to go to work," said one mother sadly. "We had four rooms, and when I was kept at home Z'lt h?d" make four hands from this house of of the landlords.

I discovered that these baby lives had been Insured by the parents and that the undertakers collected the insur­ ance money. I thought, were it possible for these little ones to hold a convention a na­ tional convention of mill and mine and factory slaves, what tales of brutality their ghastly little faces would tell without words.

Eugene Schmlts, a violinist by pro­ fession, twice elected mayor of San Francisco on a Union Labor ticket, over the combined Republican and Democratic ticket, received an Im­ mense popular ovation on his return home last wek. Mjayor Schmitz was on his way to Europe to study the workings of pub­ licly owned municipal plants, when he received a telegram on shipboard that he was to be indicted for graft In con­ nection with a restaurant license granted during his first term. The charge was first made by a French caterer, who afterward re­ tracted publicly. Two witnesses, both convicts sent up by Schmitz for ballot box stuffing, have been pardoned by the governor in order to testify. The judge before whom the case is to be tried, narrowly escaped defeat lately at the hands of the labor unions, be­ cause he was known as the handy man of the corporations. The attor­ neys for the prosecution are all paid agents' of local monopoly Interests, and have boasted that their object was to destroy the effect of labor unions in California politics.
