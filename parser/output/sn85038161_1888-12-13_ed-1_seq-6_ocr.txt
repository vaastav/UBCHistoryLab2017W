TUWSBL WITH WILDCAT TheyHakea Feroetou Assault om a roraa Hand, Who Finally Dispatches Them With Club. Anderson, Inn,, Deo. fX Last evening John Martin, a farm band, residing in the extreme northern part ot the county, had a terrlflo tussle with a pair of wildcats. It was In the dusk of the evening, and Martin was passing through a narrow strip ot timber. He was walking slowly along tbo highway, when all ot a sudden be was startled by a shrill scream, aud a cata mount sprang from a low clump of bushes Into the middle of the road In front of him. Tbo animal was unusually large and ferocious. Martin saw at onco that there was to be a fight to a finish, and thero was a mortal dread as to what the result might be. There was no time to be lost, for the cat was there for business. She sprang at the man's throat, but received a wback with his walking- stick which laid her on hor back. Just at this Juncture the malo cat appeared on the scene. Before Martin could recover his guard tho male caught him by the shoul der as it leaped and raked htm, tearing a section of hie coat and about six Inches of skin and flesh Into ribbons. Fortunately the cat missed its calculations as the man swung about with tho wolght of his blow upon the flrst one. As it was, tho wound was very painful. By this time the male bad got on Its feet again, and both cats prepared to spring at once. Martin, see ing that tho affair was getting ser ious, backed up against a treo and awaltod their onslaught He didn't have long to wait, as tho male snarling with rage, mado a leap at his throat, while the fomalo crept to one side, as If to flank him. This fact savod tho man, as ltgavo him time to relievo tho big gest ono, which ho skillfully did by jump ing to the right and striking it as it struck tho tree where ho had Just stood. Tho blow knocked It senseless. Tho fomalo made a flying leap, but anothor quick movement allowod her to strlko the baseot tho troe, whoro tho man had stood. He gavo It one bard blow on tbo sldo, but slipped and fell, when tho cat burled her tooth and claws in bis logs. It was now a rolling, tumbling fight for a very brief porlod, but the man's good luck did not desort Mm, as he was tortun ato enough to hit tho animal on tho back, breaking Its spine. As soon as be oould free himself from her embrace ho ran to the malo, which was Just getting on Its foot, and hit it two or threo terrible blows, which killed it. Both cats wore now dead, but the man was so badly torn and oxhausted that he had great difficulty In making his way to tho residence ot the nearest neighbor, wbero he was put to bed. Ho is still laid up from the offocts of his Injuries, and is llkoly to bo for some time to como.
