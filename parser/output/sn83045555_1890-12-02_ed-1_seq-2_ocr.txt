SECKErAKY 

OBLK OX "Jion JIOV ilTAUW. SEcnETAnY Kobix touched on the "Mormon" question in mucli the same minner as the President does. Still he avoids tlie rock of religious belief on which the Presi dent runs headlong. He deals with practices, and while ho does cot sanction the measures proposed for further assaults upon the "Slor mons," he favors the retention of the recent laws, so as to give time to see whether the professions In re gard lo those practices were made in good faith. There is little to ob ject to in these remarks, taking the Secretary's position into considera tion. Hut be mentions the fact that "tlie revelation containing poly gamy remains unchanged," a though this was a matter with which the Government had any tiling to do. It has been alliged against the "Mormon" Church that it aet.ks to control the State. Pass ing by tho untruthfulness of the charge, is it any more proper for the State to seek to control the Church? Revelation, doctrine, principle, creed are the peculiar province of tlie Church. The Slate has no powers in relation to them. The Constitution forbids Cougiess to in terfere with the "free exerUe" of religion. The legislators and jurists who have given the widest scoi e to the powers of Congress in relation to religious practices, have conced ed that iu mttters of faith anJ wor ship CongreeS Is entirely powerless. Revelation may be believed in ad tiitium while it does not affect tho believer to the extent of infraction of the secular law. If G-d givesa revelation, God alone can change or revoke it. If people believe God lias given a revelation, they must believe He has revoked it, before it will be changed, in their unJcrstanJ ing. If they determine to comply with the laws of the land and do so in good faith, their convictions uf the rightfulness of their faith or of the wrjngfulnes3of the law cannot be lawfully called In question. That the people of Utah have de termined to comply with the laws furbiJding polygamy we think is beyond reasonable que-tion. If their cuursa Is not yet sufficient to convince the skeptical, wc think it will da so in tints an I that even Secretary Noble will bs compelled to say It is eaoj ja.-"' But he has some personal notions repeciiug the parposa of the adop tion of the declaration forbidding polygamy. He sy3: "What is expected because of these procceil'cgs i, no doubt, a removal of tho Utah Comm!sion: the preserva tion of tho elective franchise to the member of tho church in all the States and Territories, w here they may b9 end a test oath may bs required of th?m; a restoruion of tho property of the Cnurrh; an 1 posmbly the admis sion or Utah to btalchood with or without a tea oat h ag-M nst polygamy." If these expectations entered into the preparation an 1 aioptlon of the manifesto, they are not known to the people who participated in tlie work. It Is all news to us. Wo Itelieve it is so to our frieils in this Territory. It is always unsafe to hazard opinions about motives. The Secretary of the Interior ins in this departed from tho rightful do main of fact an I law. and wandered into the doubtful field ot mental ieculaton. The '-Mormons" have simply c-ad the practice of plural inrriagij and made a r-u'ilic an nouncement of the fact, as a submis sion to las which havo been de clared constitutional by the court of lat resort. They have done to without any defined expectation of results. I fatter nil this, tho dMrauchls ment which has been threatened against law-obeylug "Mormons"' shall be effected, it will be proof be yond question to the "Mormons" that all the outcry ngainn polygamy has been iii;!ncero,andxnadeto cover 1 deeper design which is political in its ch-iract.T and wicked iu its pur pose. We certainly hope that this will not be accomplished, and wu believe that hope is shared by the "Mormon people geuerally. A

It Is announced, by advertise ment In the Xcvvs, that the Hotel Tempieton will be opened tomorrow, December 3d, to receive guests. The new building of Zlon's Saving Bank and Trust Company, corner of South Temple and Main streets, is ono ot tho mo3t majestic struc tures between the Missouri River and the Pacific Coast, and Is an ob ject of admiration with ail visitors to our growing cily. Its site is all that could be desired, being one of the features that adapts it admira bly for hotel purposes. From the upper floors the view, which takes within its scope the greater part of the valley of the Great Salt Lake, is magnificent. The bjIIJIng Is sic stories In height, exclusive of the basement. Its design is strikingly handsome, being in every respect abreast of tho times. The building committee acting for the comptny who own the structure were Messrs. George Q. Cannon, Thomas G. Webber and James Jack, anJ it neud not be saiJ that, no expense has been spared to make It a "thing of beauty." It lias been suggested that tlie apartments in this Imposing edifice are too large for hotel purposes. Of course this remark has been offered as a suggestion of doubt as to the probability Of tbo enterprise being conducted upon a paying basis. The Unusually spacious character of the rooms, however, render them all the more attractive to guests and makes their constant occupancy more certain than would be the caso if their dimensions were more con tracted. Notwithstanding the fact that the apartments are larger than tlioto ordinarily to be found in bote's the liberal proportions of the build ing admit of their being quite nu merous There are no fewer than Mighty of thcni. The height from floor to ceiling is as fallows: First UoorlS fret, second 13 feet, third 12 fret, fourth 12 feet, fifth II feit. sixth or upper flcor 12 feet. Joseph 1).

All of the glass in the north and west fronts Is plate throughout, and some of the win dows are ornamented with beautiful stained combinations. The dining hall which Is in the sixth ttiry, is a model of its kind. It occupies the entire width of the building, aud has a west nud north front, being 4ix 70 feet. While tho guests are engaged in d!poslngof tlie good things the Utst obtain able placed before them, they can aid digestion by contemplating the splendid prospect from the win dows, out of which they will be en abled to gaze in three directions, as they may elect north, south or west. The viands ore cooked on tho same floor, tbo baking only being done in the basement. The furnishing ol the apartments, which is beiug attended to by Mr. Henry Dinwoodey, is nearly com pleted, and everything in that line is done with a view to a combina tlou of elegance, comfort and con venience. A great many visitors have already called at the building and have been loud in their praises of evtrj tiling pertaining to the hotel. To such an extent has the fame of the house already spread that the manager, Mr. Alonzo Ycutig, has been plied thick and fat iili applications for rooms. So much has this been tho caso that nqtmts of time-occupants have bad to be declined in order that fflce miht be reserved for transi ent guests, whom it Is desired to ac commodate. The house having machinery and apparatus for the purpose, will sup ply It o n lighting, which will I done by electricity. In order to avoid a catastrophe in case of a breakdown in the source of supply of tlie fluid, however, gas can be turned ou in an emergency, all the ceceary fitting being in position. The latet return-call system has also been introduced, so that when n guest dignities by a touch of the appropriate button that he needs the iM-rvices of a metssace bov. h re reives a respone by a signal which informs him lie lias been heard and his ants will be attended to. Tho means or extinguishing flres in their inciniency are complete and ample. On each floor is a hose and nozzle, capable of throwing a respectable stream Upon any point where it may be needed. Fire escape facilities are of great moment In l-irge structures such as that now lielng described.
