The election takes place Saturday wook; tho Convention to assem ble tho 20th of January. Gen. J.'C. Vaughn was callod to the chair, mid C. B. Woodward requested to act as Secretary. " Jaa, A. Coffin, and Itobl. Snead, were placoit ih nomination. Jas. A. Coffin re ceived the almost uimnituous vote of tho Convention, and was consequently declared by tho' Chair, tho nominee of tho Conven tion. : ' Mr. Coffin rotnrned his thanks to tho peoplo for the honor conferred, und an swered, to the satisfaction of all present, a fow qaostions which were propounded,' af ter which the Convention adjourned. The people of tho County should feel proud of the selection of such a gentleman as Mr. Cuffin, and with your support, we feel confident that Monroo will ho ntly and faithfully represented. Let there bo a largo vote polled for Mr. Coffin, thus exhibiting tho implicit confidence we be lieve you to huvo in him. This is an im portant election, and it is the duty of all voters, who favor an overhauling of our Constitution, to turn out en masse; this will be an incentive to our delegate to labor tho moro zealously for our future welfare und intcrost. TVe Lopo no Con servative will opposo him. Aa to tho Radical party bringing out a caudidate, ;ve have but little to say. They may pick their man, and bring alt'their force to bcar,but it will avail them nothing, as they are uowouly knowu us a thing that was, and now done for, never to be resur rected. An it is but a short time Wore the election tikes place, ami limns being hut one more issue of our paper before Unit day, wo have been re quested to call on Mr. Collin to define hix position through the columns of our next ietiiio in order tlint tho people may know his vivwsu the qucsr tiotmnow before them. ; The Interest on the State Debt. This is a question of serious import, in the present embarrassed condition of tho finances of the State; and one that should receive tho earnest consideration of tho Legislature. To that body the people have entrusted their honor ami interest; and every effort consistent with tho duties and rights they aro under to their con stituents, should bo made to preservo tho honor. und integrity of tho Sjato. Tonncs--H.' ifus heretoforo maintained a Ligli char acter among her sister States. From cir cumstances beyond control, growing out of tho war, her tinanccs havo become embar rassed. Tho two preceding Legislatures utteii.jietl to meet tho interest upon tho Stato debt, first by funding that which had accumulated during the war and by increasing the rate of taxation. They wero compelled to largely increaso the debt to put iu operation the railroads that were broken down during the war, and in which they had so large an interest; it became necessary to do so to save the amounts that had already been advanced. Whether tho policy was right or wrong is no longer an open question. The bonds were issued, and they have passed into the bands of innocent holders; and the State is bound in honor to pay the accruing interest. 1 propose to show from the report of the Comptroller that by proper legislation, the securing interest can be paid, and the honor and credit of the State saved, with out increasing the rate of taxation. The interest due on tho 1st of July, 18G9, is 1,100,000; ditto duo tho 1st of January, 1870 ; Dank of Tennessee, say $2,000,000, making $3,100,000. Balance against Treasury for fiscal year ending 30th of October, 1870, would be: tho claim of Messrs. Ward & Jiriggs, $207,000 ; out standing warrants duo 30th Ostober, I860, $200,000; borrowed money duo 30tli Oc tobor, 1863, $100,000; claim of tho United States against the Memphis Charleston and Louisville Railroad Company, $511, 500, Stale interest duo July 1, 1870 $1, 100,000 making in all tho sum $2,270, 500. To meet this debt the taxable prop erty of tho State is, say $225,000,000. At the present rate of six mills to the dollar, revenue is $1,350,000. Deducting expenses for collecting, $200,000, loaves l,lo0,00Q. Add from taxes on privileges and polls $730,000, and amount from Rail roads $800,000, making $2,080,000. De duct from this amount current expenses of the State $400,000, leaving $2,280,000, to pay indebtedness of the State at tho cud of the hscal year 1870. By assessing the State tax, on property at twelve mills to the dollar, and on priv ileges in like proportion, payable in Bank of Tennesseee paper; and at six mills in national currency, thj amount would be re alized in par fuuds. The levying of taxes is an act of sovereignty, and the State can not be controlled in the exercise of that right. Taxes aro not debts. This ques tion is no longer an open one, as settled by tho Supreme Conrt at Washington in the case of ''Looe vs the State of Oregon," re ported in 7 Wallace; in which it was held, that the State had a right to levy a tax, payable in kind. The debt of $4,200, 000, for the Bunk of Tennessee, aud the unpaid interest, could be funded. The holders of Tennessee paper, under sucli a. policy, would gladly reoeive the bonds of the State. They are principally in the hands of speculators; but a small sum would bo paid to collectors ; and the in terest could thus bo met that would accrue after January, 1870. Within the next two years the defaulting railroads would be sold and " the debt greatly reduced. Consequently the taxes, after that time, would bo greatly lesscued. -If such a pol icy should be adopted the amount paid to the common schools would havo to be with drawn for a short time. Let those coun ties that wish tho school system carried out, have the right to levy tax for school purposes. If no effort is made to pay the interest on the debt, it is equivalent to repudiation, and a stigma will forever be fixed upon the State. Interest is a constantly increas ing liability, and if permitted to accumu late, will not in the end be met. To make no provision for the debt is repudiation. Let the members of tho Legislature de termine to meet the debt as men to whom such high trusts aro confided; they will bo retained by their constituents, aud their acts will meet the approbation of all true patriots. Resumption of Specie Payments. Tho New York World has sent out a re porter around among the business men of that city to "interview" them in the hope of learning something of the real condition of the country. One of tho men "inter viewed" was Potor Cooper, who has been in active business for moro than half a cen tury. Mr. Cooper said: "I thiuk there is much causo for alarm in the present aspect of commercial affairs. I fear we aro in danger of another crash similar to that of 1857, especially if there is too sudden a return to specie payments. Before the war there was a great want of stability thoughout tho country, particu larly iu the agricultural districts. Every thing was conducted upon credit, and three farms out of fivo wore mortgaged. Near ly everybody was dependent on the banks, as, unless they could obtain discounts, they could not get on. During the- war, when prices were high, most of tho people wero wise enough to pay off their debts, and in producing this result, our other ter rible losses wero more than compensated for. Siuee the return of peace, however, there has been a return to tho old credit system ; peoplo have been tempted to spec ulate, and live beyond thoir means; and there are thousands win, if they were sud denly forced to make a settlement of their affairs, would not be ablo to pay fifty per cent, of their indebtedness." A very decided impression prevails among tho safest and most successful bus iness men of the country that violent re sumption of specie payments would result in a disastrous crash. This feeling has reached some of the loading men in Con gress. Senator Sherman declared to the Washington correspondent of tho New York Herald, tho other day, that ho be lieved an attempt to resume tho specie pay ments at once would bo dangerous to all commercial classes. Tho Baltimore Gazette, in an article upon the folly of attempting to forco a re sumption, calls attention to the fact that in 1817, after twenty years of suspension, and when gold had fallen to less than one per cent premium, resumption was deter mined upon in England. In some parts of tho country bullion had boon so abun dant that country bankers found it diffi cult to dispose of their gold. Yet so great was the rush for coin, the moment that resumption was attempted, and so danger ously were the business interests of the country disturbed, that, on the report of Mr. 1'eel, the House in two nights passed a bill for tho relief of the bank. Finally, resumption was postponed till 1823. When left to itself, unhampered by hasty legislation, the bank resumed specie pay ments as soon as the credit of tho State had been firmly established, and two years before tho time limited.
