On the second page of to-day's paper will bo found an article Cn the crop of 18G2. TUB Waß DiiPARIIOEST, Au Abstract HcpoTt of Secretary fsiaiiloa, ' The Secretary of "War details the military operations during tbe past year; points to the fact that tbe Department of the Pacific has been free from any of tbe calamities occasion ed by the rebellion; an earnest and deep sym pathy bas been manifested by tbe-loyal citi zens of tbe Pacific States, in support of tbe Union. Prom a survey ot tbe “whole field of operations, it is apparent whatever disasters our arms may have Buffered at particular points, a great advance has been m'.de since the commencement of tbe war. Tnc Union forces are cow in the field under able com ynflTiftffH, stronger than ever, resolute and eager to be led agaloettbe enemy, to crush the rebellion by a vigorous winter campaign. The armies of the Potomac and tbe West stand ready to vie with each other In dealing the quickest and heaviest blows against the enemy. Tangbt by experience of tbe ruin of inaction, and the hazard of delay a spirit of earnest activity seems to pervade tbe forces of tbe United Statesbeyond what has hitherto been exhibited. In tbe numerous battles and engagements that have occurred, our armies in general have displayed the courage and de termination that should inspire officers and soldiers fighting in defense of their govern ment. Under the crils of July and August, there are already in the field over 4-0,000 new troops, of which CM,OOO are volunteers: 532,000 of whom have volunteered for three years or the war. It will be remembered the call was made at one ot these periods of de spondency which occur in every national struggle. A chiefhope of those who set the rebellion I on foot was for aid and comfort from disloyal sympathizers in the Northern Stale*, whose efforts were relied upon to divide and distract the people of tbe North and prevent them ' from putting forth their whole strength to preserve the national existence. The call for volunteers and. a draft of the militia afforded an occarlon for disloyal per sons to accomplish their evil purposes by dis couraging enlistments and encouraging oppo sition to the war and the dralt ot soldiers to cany it on. Anxiety was frit in some States at the prob ■able success of these disloyal practices, and the government was urged to adopt measures of protection by temporary restraint of those engaged in these hostile acts. To that end, "Provost Marshall were ap pointed in some States, upon tbe nomination of their Governors, to act under the direction of the State Executive, and the writ of habeas cotyms wassnfpeuaed by our order. By order ol the "War Department arrests were forbidden, unless authorized by the State Executive or Judge Advocate. Seme instances of unauthorized arrest* •have occurred, and when brought to the notice of the Department, the parties have | been immediately discharged. By a recent order, all persons arrested for, discouraging enlistments, or for disloyal prac tices in the Stales where the quotas of volun teers and militia are filled up, have been re leased. Other persons arrested by military com manders and sent from departments where their presence was deemed dangerous to the publie safety, have been discharged upon pa role to be of good behavior, and do no act of hostility against the Government of the United -States. ■While military arrests of disloyal persons form tbe subject of complaint in some States, the discharge of such persons is complained ol in other States. It has been the aim of the Department to avoid any encroachments upon individual -rights as far as might be consistent with the public safety; but reflecting minds will per ceive that no greater encouragement can be to the enemy—no more dangerous act ol hostility can be perpetrated in this war— ! than efforts to prevent recruiting and enlisting for the armies upon whose strength the Na tional existence depends. The expectations ol the rebel leaders and their sympathizers in the loyal States that tbe -call for volunteers would notbeaneweredand that tbe draft could not be inforced, have failed and nothing is left but to clamor at the means by which their hopes were frustrated and to strive to disarm the Government in future, if, in the chances of war, another occasion for increasing the military force should arise. 'Besides aiding the State authorities respect ing the draft.and enlistment another important ■duty is assigned to the Provost Mashals. The army returns and the report of the Gen. 3n-Cbit£ shows that a largenumber of officers axd enlisted soldiers arc absent from their posts. • The pursuit ot such persons, aud their com * pulsory return to duly, is a necessary function ola Provost Marshal, and such a number of < them only aa may be required for that purpose will in future be re talced in tbe service. The pay and bounty allowed by act of Con gress to recruits have offered strong tempta tions to practice fraud upon the Government by false returns upon the muster rolls, and false charges forsubsistence. Diligent efforts are being made for the de tection of all such practices, and to bring the guilty parties, some of whom have held re sponsible stations in society, before a proper -civil or military tribunal as soon as tbe pre liminary investigations by the Judge Advocate can be completed. The same course is being pursued in respect “to fraudulent contractors and disbursing offi cers, • The expenditures for enlistments, recruit ing, drifting .and subsistence ol volunteers, ■regulars and militia, amounts to the sum ol ,$20,682,292.91. The general acquiescence of all the loyal . States in the measures deemed necessary to strengthen the armies and prosecute the war at every hazard to final success, proves the fidelity of the people to the Government, and their determination, to maintain its unity aud xiphoid its authority over the whole terxitorv ox the United States. J Hie Secretary says that experience has shown that serious defects exist in the militia law, which should be promptly remedied. The laws relative to volunteers also need amend ment. The views of the Department on these . subjects will be communicated to the appro priate committees of Congress. It will be seen that the Quartermaster's Deportment, JrM T -M-' VOLUME XV. upon which, under the law of the 7th cf July, providing for the employment of colored per sona, the charge of such persons ia chiefly im posed, has nottounditßeU burdened with their care, out that it has, on the contrary, derived valuable aid from thtir labor, and in a consid erable portion of its field of operations, has fhxis far Buffered from a scant rather than from, too great a supply of snch labor. In Louisiana, where, at one time, there were apprehensions of embarrassment from. the number of refugees, the reserve of,, a tract of rich land along the railroad to Berwick's Bay opens up a territory in which man? thou sands can be profitably employed if placed under proper regulation and control. At Port Loyal, such persons have been extensively employed in the Quartermaster’s department and in cultivating some thousands of acres of the sea islands of the coast, the products of which arc used in the support of themselves families. operations of tfac army on the James River and upon the Potomac, in the fortifications of Washington, and as la borers, teamsters, hostlers, and in the landing and shipping of stores they have been of great service, anclthe demand for their labor has exceeded the'supply available. The successful movement of the various expeditions by sea, the transportation of such large bodies of troops, and their regular sup-' ply fit distant points of the coast, afford strik ing proofs of the greatness of the military re sources of the nation. These movements have been on a scale of great magnitude. The collection of. the vast armies which -have been raised, and their transportation to the field-of operations in so brief a period, would not have been possible but for the ex tent oi our.aystem of steam transport by rail road, river and sea. It has not been found necessary to exercise within the loyal States the power conferred Upon the President by law to take actual mil itary possession of the railroads of the country. The various companies met ia convention In this city, united in proposing a uniform tariff for Government transportation, which appears to bejast and equitable, and they have performed all the services required of them by the department with a promptness, efficiency and cheerfulness, which do honor to the patri otism of their managers. * * Every means the country'affords has been put forth to complete the armaments of onr forts and fortifications for the defense of har bors and coasts, as is shown by me report of this bureau; those details are, for obvious reasons, not now seated, and the legislation required by this branch of the service will, by your direction, be communicated to the Ap propriate committee. The subject of armiag : ;be particularly those defending the harbors of our principal Atlantic porta, has received special attention, and ali the means at the disposal of the department have been applied to that end, so far as was possi ble and consistent with meeting other imper ative requirements. In consequence of the introduction into naval warfare of iron cUd vessels, compara tively sale from the effects of such batteries os had hitherto been sufficient to gtitrd effectually against the passage of hostDc ves sels, it became necessary to provide heavier and more powerful ordnance. The whole system of such armament was carefully re vised and amended by a board of the most experienced and competent officers, and measures have been taken to carry their ac commodations into efiee*. The Secretary calls special attention to the rcccsrity of providing additional means for the storage and preservation of ordinary sup plies, as recommended in the report of the Chief of Ordnance. The at ! ention ot the De partment has been earnestly directed to the torts and fortifications for coast and harbor defensts. A personal inspection of thc*e iiu- Tortaut. works has been made by Gen. Totten, tbe distinguished Chief of Engineers. The grants made by Congress for fortifications amounted to fire millions five hundred aud tinny-live dollars for permanent works, and seven hundred and filly thousand do Lira for Umpcruiy works. Tlic Chitf ol Engineers report*that these sums admitted of very ma terial projrreFe being made at most of the ia portaut forts now in process of conslracion. This. Las been rcaliz.d in a lumber ot instances, and in all a decided :td v?.i cement had been effected. Great difficulties have been experienced in obtaining eui‘x*iif p of materials from the quarries. Stone yarns, Ac., owing to the demands made upon the classes usually employed in this bind of works by the War Department. Similar trouble has been encountered In procuring transportation lor materials. Slush his been done In advancing the state of readiness ot our fortifications iu the principal commercial harbors *or service, in preparing for addition al guns, in preparing for the reception of ar mament of very large calibre in the existing batteries, and in placing all in effective condi tion ot defense. Like measures h*ve bean observed with reference to naval stations and i our frontier generally. The Secretary says no aphorism is more universally received than that the sole object of a just war is to make the enemy ffitl the evils of his injustice, and by his sufferings ameedhis ways, and he must therefore be at tacked in most accessible quarters. The •jiower of the rebels rests up an their peculiar system of labor, which keeps laborers on their plantations, to support owners who are devoting their time and strength to destroy our armies and destroy our Government. 'Whenever that system is in hostility to the Government, it is, in his opinion, the. duty of those conducting the war to strike down the system,and tnrnsgsm&t the rebels the produc tion power that upholds the insurrection. Blghtly organized in the recovered terrlfc >rr, the laborers of the rebels will not. aid in hold ing fortified posilions, but their labor will, as «n India, free the white soldiers from the most unwholesome exposure of the South. They will cultivate the corn end forage which will feed our cavalry and artillery' bore?, and save the country a portion of the enormous burden now attending their purchase and transportation from the North. This cul tivation would have been of greater advan tage to us on the southeastern coa>t than even that of the great staple of the sea-islands, fie says, in conclusion the greater part of the*whole country, which formerly pr> ; duccdlhc Sea Island cotton is now throughly restored to the Union—the laborers are there, i the soil and climate ; i r needs only assurance I of protection to revive the cultivation of the staple, as wall as to produce vast quantities oi com and forage for our troops. Since this ■war must be conducted by marches, and bat ilcs, and seiges, why neglect the oest means to make them successful, and their results permanent ? It is worthy of notice' that thus fir the portions of territory which we have re ceived, and must firmly hold, are precisely those in which the greatest proportion of | colored men are found. By their assistance , armies will be permanent to operate in aud : occupy the country, aud iu labor for the army, in raising its and their own sup plies, full occupation can be given them; and with this there will be neither oc casion nor iemp’aTiou to them to emigrate to a northern and less congenial climate. Judg ing by experience, no colored man will leave ins Lome in' Lhe South, If protected iu that home. All possibility of competition from negro labor iu the North U avoided iu giving colored men protection and employment upon the soil whica they have, thus tar cultivated, the right to which has been vacated by the original proprietors, deeply involved la the crimes of treason and rebellion. No great territory has been permanently reduced with out depriving the leaders of the people of tick laurels ami property. IE Is these tbit give power and iutluence, Few mm have the commanding genius aud talent to exercise dangerous iutluence over their fellow-rueo, without the adventitious aid ol money aud property. By striking down this system of compulgo.'y labor, which enables the leaders of rebellion to control the resources ot the people, the rebellion would dieof itself. Ua der no circumstance? has any disposition to servile insurrection been exhibited by tha col ored people- In any State, while a strong loyalty to the Federal Government has been ‘displayed on every occasion, and against every discouragement. By the means sug gested, the rebellion may be disarmed and subdued swifty aud effectually, and lives of our own people saved from slaughter on the batDe-fitdd. By the occupation of all their forts on the Mississippi, and the sea coast, a market will be opened in every rebel State for the industry of our people to sup ply the wants of the army, aud also of a loyal population in exchange tor the valuabloproducts ot their labor. Another point of attack is by armed settlements upon the vafcant government lands InFloridaand Texas, thousands in the Northern and Western States are impatiently wilting tne signal of military movement to plant their homes on the best territory of this continent, and orlog it back to the Union as loyal States. So far from the Southern States being invincible no country was ever so vulnerable of the moans at hand as arc employed against them. If your proposition for compensated emancipa tion and a voluntary return to loyalty be blindly rejected, sllU the proper application of the me ms at the command of the govern ment cannot faU to accomplish the suppres sion of the rebellion and a restoration Of those peaceful relations which were-designed to be established lor ever on this continent by the union of the Slates.

General Rosecrans has made a forward movement towards Murfreesboro, and, as the enemy have made a stand there, and determ ined to give battle, an engagement during the present week is expected. The Federal army has advanced with limited transportation and ten days 1 rations. The enemy are claimed r.o be well fortified between Murfreesboro and Dt'churd, in a naturally strong position. Gtn.

They profess to he very 'much opposed to burning any more cotton, but every man they can pick up over eighteen and under forty five they force to go with them. Many are hiding in woods from these conscript gather ers. The people of Shelby county are repre sented as being afraid to vote in the approach ing Congressional election, least the guerillas I prowling around may utterly destroy them. | It is said that many of them will en deavor to get secret voting places, while others will come to the city to vote. The people in Shelby are cut off from all commu nication, except with the confederates. They have very erroneons views of the President’s Proclamation, and think that after the Ist of January an attempt will he made to get up insurrections among the slaves. ■ The necessary steps have been taken to elect a Sheriff for Shelby county at the next term of the Quarterly Court, which meets at Raleigh in January. Information from 'Brownsville is of the most gratifying character,. The Union cause there is progressing finely. All are for the Union and the Constitution.

MATTERS AT THE CAPITAL. The Growing Crop of Brigadiers. WEST POINT—BUREAU OF AGMOULTUfiE. The Military Imbroglios Present and Prospective, Pope at ILe Fitz John Porter Cabinet Changes—Commissary [SpecialDispatch to the Chicago Tribune. Washington, Dec. 4,1502. Four prisoners taken by Sieivart, in hb first raid to Pena., returned from Richmond to-day on thirty day’s parole. They make the usual complaints about ill treatment, being robbed of their blankets, *fcc., and give usual repre sentations about suffering, and scarcity among the rebels. Intercepted correspondence between Bowen the rebel Governor of Louisiana, and Jelf. Davis stows a bitter feeling in consequence of Davis having prohibited trade -with New Orleans, thus causing great suffering as was supposed among the people. Pope’s reference to Sigel in Ms dispatches lately brought out in Htdleck’s reports has created the bitterest possible feeling among Sigel’s friends, who freely accuse Pope of du plicity and quote as an evidence of it his speech in Chicago, made shortly after he had in these dispatches to Halleck, declared Sigel unreliable and unfit for command, in which speech, he professed the highest respect for Sigel as a soldier and gentleman. They say they now a i'e determined to have all the chargee against Sigel, cleared up. It is pretty evident that we shrill soon have another mili tary imbroglio on hand similar to the presenl one about Porter, Buell and McDowell. Congress did little to-day beyond listening to Eulogies on the late Senator Thompson of New Jersey; those by Ten Eyck and Latham were peculiarly applicable. Business comes in slowly, the committee being unable as yet to mature much. Both Houses would have adjourned over till Mon day to let the committee work, but for the desire to receive Chase’s report to-morrow. A remonstrance against West Point Academy was acted on In a manner which shows as yet thst there is little danger ot the abolition of that institution. The numbers are increasing, however of influential men, who declare they will never vole tor future appropriations lor it under the present organization. The movement against the Department of Agriculture, inaugurated by Lane, of Indiana, in the Seuat£ will be .urged on the ground that, as at present organized, that Department re of no use to anybody except those who have offices in it, * The suicide of Capt. O. L. Wood oa ac count of his arrest, continues to elicit com plaints against the whole system of arrests as practiced throughout the North by military authorities. The opposition in Congress will make it the pretext for the violent abuse of t he Administration. Wood was an officer of the regular army, from Ohio, appointed from civil li-e. Thclist’of the newly appointed Brigadier ! Generals is secret. The lollowlngadditloiial appointments have, however, become public: Col. Vandever, 91h Iowa; Col. Williams, 2d Iowa; Col. Lowe,' sih Iowa; Col. Bussy, Sd lowa cavalry. It is understood that some changes are being made in this list, aud the appointments cannot therefore be regarded as •absolutely safe till this list is sent tp the Sen-1 ate. There will be difficulty in confirming 1 any cf them, the present law expressly limit- I ing the number of Brigadiers to 300. Theap-1 pointment of more is, however, regarded by I military men as an absolute necessity since the I late levies, but the law must he repealed be-, j fore they can. he confirmed, and some will op-1 I pose the repeal of the law, believing that we j | have too many Generals now. - 1 The Minnesota Indian compromise busi- 1 ness takes a fresh turn to-day. The Prcsi-1 dent now decides that out of the thirty Indi-1 I ans whom he has determined to hang, only I an installment shall be first executed. If the j I people cf Minnesota can be satisfied to let I I the hanging rest at this point, it is safe to say J I the President will be satisfied too. I j The publication of Secretary Seward’s di- I j plcmatic correspondence is unexpectedly de- J { laved, for some reason that nobody under | stands. I In Fitz John Porter’s court-mar till I to-day, Pope was examined. His testi- I mony went to establish the truth ot | j charges against Porter of willfully disobeying ; I orders and refusing to engage the enemy on ( the battle field. A pretty clear case seemed 1 to be made out against Porter, but his counsel | in the case, in examining Pope, involved him j in a contradiction, which wiil somewhat dam- I sge his evidence. They got him to admit that I five days after the battles were over he told } Porter he had nothing against him of suffi- I cient magnitude to warrant any proceedings, I When asked why he told Porter so, he refused t to answer. The snecessorehip to Smith in the Cabinet still excites speculations. Several heads of the bureau in the department seem to fiver U&hsr, Wright, McKee, or Dunn, and De crees is also talked of. Holt is believed to have the fairest chance yet with the Presi dent, The Indiana delegation do not insist that the successor shall be taken from their State. The efforts in Cincinnati to explain, away the beef-tea swindle in the medical depart ment, arc utterly false. The material -was mere starch, bnt was represented by 'Wayne as granulated beef. Medical men say it would have been very injurious in cases for-which real granulated beef would have been bene ficial. The swindle was thus attempted on sick 1 soldiers, as well as on the government I Some Philadelphia firms have also been de- 1 tect€d;in famishing grossly adulterated-1 liquors for army medical use. I Gen, Slgcl has demanded o court of In- I quiry, to investigate the charges brought I against him in Pope’s dispatch, published in I Haßeck’s report, and now the fight opens. j Cant. John L. Elwood, formerly Quarter- I master United States Army, has been confined I forlhree months in the prison near the Old J Capitol, committed suicide Wednesday. He. was formally elected Colonel of a New York regiment but arrested on unknown charges by j order of the Secretary of War before he as sumed command. . _ . The Court Martial of Gen. Fite John Porter was in session to-day, Gen. Pope being under examination. The substance of his testimony is that it Porter had obeyedhls orderprompt ly be could have entirely defeated if not cap tured Jackson’s army. • • Senator Wilkinson of Minnesota to-day presented an earnest but respectful protest •to the President against the pardon or re- j prieveof the condemned Indians in that State. Alter reading this paper to the President, ! Messrs. Windom and Aldrich being present and heartily endorsing his project, decided to join therein with Senator Wilkinson, thus making unanimous the action of the entire Republican delegation in Congress from that S *New York, Dec. 4.—At a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce to-day, a letter was received fromfiecrefcaiy Welles, An addition al force will be dispatched In search of the. Alabama, as soon as practicable. 1 . There is no authority for granting commis sions to private vessels to search for the Ala bama or other piratical vessels dr privateers.

FROM SPRINGFIELD. EtTEEESTISG CASE IE! AD- MffiALTT. CHANGES IN ILLINOIS MILITARY. Speikgtteld, Dec. 4.—The United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois is now in session as a Court of Ad miralty, Judge Treat presiding. Yesterday, the suits against the steamboats Kentucky and New Madrid, for insurrectionary traffic, were decided against the libelers and decrees entered accordingly. . . The two boats were captured at Memphis and brought into the jurisdiction of the Court at Cairo. Mr. “Weldon appeared for the government and Messrs. Hoyt & Culom ifor defendants. There are several other cases of similar character pending before the court. There is a flutter among the banks on account of the action of the Bank Commissioners. Brig. Gen. EUet, of the ram fleet, arrived aud had an interview with the Governor to-day, rela tive to the opening of the Mississippi River. Capt. Jno L. Johnson, company A, 21st Illi nois volunteers, has been, discharged the ser vice, with loss of pay and emoluments. Cap tain D. F. Sellard, of the 89ih Illinois volun teers, has been discharged—cause disability. The resignation of Capt Boyd Morse, oith Il linois volunteers, is accepted. Edward C. Delavan, of Albany, New York, has prepared a tract on temperance, which he proposes to distribute among Western regi ments, and solicits aid in so doing. It is well ■written. John A. Broes, of Chicago, tikes rank as senior captain of the BS:h Illinois, Colonel Sherman. Mr. J. C. Conkling has been ap pointed Slate Agent at "Washington, in place of Hod. Thcs. H. Campbell, deceased. THE WAR |N VIRGINIA. MATTF.es BEFORE FREDE RICKSBURG. Tlie gofilhern Approach to " Riclimond, Fortress Monroe, Dec. 4.—"We leam from those who have had au opportunity of seeing for themselves, that Petersburg, and along the route between there and Richmond, is be ing fortified by digging rifle pits and throwing up strong earth works. Large forces are at work upon, them day and night. New York, Dec. 4.—The Herald has the following: "Washington, Dec, 3.—There is nothing of importunes from the army ot the Potomac. AverilPs cavalry has not yet returned from their icconnoissance. Everything remains perfectly quiet, and there is no prospect of an immediate movement. The army is well sup plied with rations and forage. Tne rebels have about tbirly batteries, large and small, some of them,mounting heavy guns bearing unon the north bank ol the Rappahannock. ‘lt is said our pontoons, In being carried to position where they were to be used, passed nearly the whole distance along the river rosds, in plain view of the enemy, cud tUls fact, together with the other, that the pro posed movement was expected by the Times’ correspondent, induces the belief that a des perate fight ■will ensue ou an attempt on our part to cross. A large amount of fresh vegetables have been, ordered for -Sumner’s and Franklin’s corps, eeuivy having made its appearance among them. Government is taking steps whereby the railroad from Aqula Creek to Fredericksburg will be provided with the rolling stock neces sary to furnish supplies, troops, &c ,to Burn side’s army. The New York Tima 1 special says: It is proper to stale that Burnside- never possessed the confidence of Government more than at present, and that, siucehis recent visit to Washington, the confidence has resulted in a great increase in his powers, and his libera tion fiom many of the restraints under which he had previously labored. Ail stories to the effect that the army of the Potomac will go into winter quarters are sheer fabrications. There wiil be no cessa- I tion till the rebellion is beyond the power of | mischief. | Our advices from Falmouth aud Fredericks burg confirm the information lately received, that Lee is removing a large portion of his forces southward, and concentrating them In such a manner as to be able either to march to the relief of Richmond, in case of attack in flank, or to act as a reserve in case of an as- I sanlt at Fredericksburg. I A Falmouth letter otthe 2d states that there I are rumors aud other indications of an early I movement. If made it will probably be a I change of position, though involving perhaps j a considerable engagement. Obstacles to a 1 general and final advance of the army still ex ist. New Creek, Va., Dec. 4.—The Ringgold Cavalry, of Mulligan’s brigade, engaged this morning the rebel cavalry under Kerkendall and McDonald, at Moortield. After a sharp conflict they defeated and routed the enemy, capturing among others, the notorious Capt. McDonald, one of the most dangerous men of Western Virginia. The captain Is now a prisoner in his own house at this place. mm mum mmi The War in South Carolina, Fortress Monroe, Dec, 3.—Latest South ern advices say that the channel through the stone blockade at Charleston is temporarily obstructed by railroad iron, so that the rebels can easily remove it for their own use. The message of Gov. Pickens, South Carolina, alludes to the emancipation procla mation, and recommends the formation of a State Guard of citizens, under eighteen and over forty-five, for police duty. He says the State has famished 42,000 Confederate troops, besides eight regiments for coast defense. He urges the prompt organization of negro labor, eothat the fortifications around Charles ton mav be made permanent. Col. Duncan K. Mcßae, formerly Consul at Pails, has resigned his commission in the army, because, as he says in a letter to Gov. : Vance, he can no longer, consistently with : his sense of dignity and self-respect, .serve the government of the confederate States. [Correspondence N. Y. Herald.] Hiltok Heap, S. C. t Nov, OS, ISC3. Fort Pulaski is garrisoned by a strong xorce of Union troops. Since these troops hare been within its walls the work of repairing the ghastly breaches which we made during the bombardment in April has reached completion, and no traces of the damage which our fearful shells inflicted now remain, save a few deep scars upon the easterly foe?. The entire disappearance of the y ello w fever from our midst is the occasion of profound thankfulness. The pestilence has departed. The stringent quarantine regulations which have' been so long enforced were this morolcg revoked, and entering vessels now reach the wharf without the delay which the advent of the health officer was wont to occasion. Medi cal Director Deane declares that there is now not the slightest danger in bringing uuacell mated troops into the department, and his of ficial opinion to that effect goes to Washing ton by to-day’s steamer. We are looking for reinforcements. The sooner they come the better. They will find the troops now here anxious to co-operate with them in sn active winter campaign. The statement that Gen. Hunter U to re turn to this Department, though at first dis credited, is now accepted as a part of the pro gramme of the Government. The Army on the Western Frontier. St. Lotus, Dec. S.—Gen. Blunt telegraphs to headquarters that Hindman and Merma duke are concentrating their forces, 25,000 strong, preparatory to an attack upon him. Blunt will not retreat, and, as reinforcements under Herron are on the way, there is a pros pect of another battle near the scene of the last at CaneHQl.. Frank; P. Blair, Jr. Cairo, Dec.
