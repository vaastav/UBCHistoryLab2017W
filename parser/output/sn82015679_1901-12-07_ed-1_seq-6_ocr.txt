Glover, of Ayrshire, Pike coun ty, pleaded guilty In the United States Court yesterday to making a fraudulent statement In order to get a pension, and was sentenced to seventy days In the work house and fined $10 and costs. It appears that a veteran soldier named Willis Glover, living In Kentucky, applied for a pension, and while John W. Glover was in Ken tucky in the same neighborhood a letter to Willis Glover fell Into his hands, and he decided to impersonate the other man and get "the pension.

Glover was arrested. William Dibble, charged with sending ob jectionable literature through the malls, was fined J3 and costs, a jury having found him guilty. W. H.

Tnylor-FInlejr Measure Argued In the S n a to. The senate of Shortridge High School yesterday discussed the Taylor-Finley measure. After Catherine McCoy, Mary Class. Hehn Spain and Edwin Lewis were sworn in the bill imposing a sentence on a Governor for refusing to honor a requisi tion was read. The minority report of the committee in favor of the bill was passed and the author of the bill. Senator Lodge (Edwin Friend), took the floor. In an earn est manner the senator asked the body to pass the bill. Senator Fairbanks followed against the question, and then the gentle man from Vermont (Herbert Wagner) be gan a speech against the bill. The diminu tive Senator Gear (Luther Benson) de manded recognition from the chair, who at last succeeded in Retting those on the floor to sit down. Senator Gear made a short speech in favor of the measure, after which Senator Deboe delivered a strong speech against the bill, 'n which he scored he Kentucky courts in spite of the fact that he is supposed to be from the Blue grass State. The scene which followed the argument of the Kentucky senator was exciting. A large part of the body immediately ob jected to the honor of Kentucky's courts 'being questioned, but quiet was finally re stored by the presiding officer. The deep voice of Senator Prltchard (Earl Pritchard) was heard, and that tall and stately gen tleman proceeded to tell the senate about a "certain State that was strongly parti san and the courts decidedly corrupt." He was not Interrupted until he came to the mention of ex-Governor Taylor's name, when the chamber was filled with cries of "I object." "Point of order" and similar declarations. The chair then decided that the Carolina gentleman was not "personal," because he had not said anything against any of the body. Senator Lodge gained the floor and answered many of the opposition's argu ments. After a short parliamentary tan gle the meeting adjourned. This was the most enjoyable and interesting session this term, and the senate is fast gaining the popularity that characterized the meetings a few years ago when Pettljohn, Cohen, Crossland and others were the "stars." Shortrltlse Note. The Do-Do Club of junior girls will meet with May Rliss, 2026 North Alabama street, Monday afternoon. XXX The Shortridge football team will be en tertained at dinner this evening by the principal of the school. XXX The committee from the enior class will report on plans for Che coming entertain ment at its next meeting Friday morning. A book fair is probable. xxx Ernest Sims. thn "honor" member of the 1901 class, who has been "posting," has been compelled to leave school on account of trouble with his eyes. xxx The High School Chess Club will meet with Walte Colgan Tuesday evening. Fol lowing is the standing or the members in the tournament that is now going on: Fred Herzch, Waite Colgan, Harry Walter house, Paul Edwards, Edward Gibson, No ble Praig. xxx The civil government classes under Miss Donnan will hold debates next week on the President's message. One side will argue that it Is perfect in every detail, while the opposition will try to prove that it is lacking in many phases, including grammatical construction. The history classes, under Mr. Dunn, will also study President Roosevelt's message to Congress on Monday. xxx There is a possibility that the High School cadet company may get a new lease on life and continue to be an organization. Richard Langsdale, a member of the com pany, has received a letter from Merrill Moores in which he strongly encouraged a military organization for several reasons. Another effort will bo made to form a com pany and. it is thought, will be success ful. A number of boys from a cavalry company under Captain Sumner Clancy have agreed to Join the Shortridge boys, and Clancy will be a lieutenant. If this plan Is carried out the company's success is assured. x x Thoso interested in forming a debating: club met yesterday afternoon. The boys present were Ed Eitle, Fred Appel, Al fred Darlow. Bartlett Williams, Albert Euchanan and James Hoag. A committee composed of Albert Buchanan, Bartlett Williams and Paul Edwards will frame a constitution. Mr. Scott, of the faculty, will be the critic, and the first debate will be held a week from next Thursday on the question, "Should Manual Training be Taught in the Shortridee High School?" Ed Eitle and Bartlett Williams will lead the affirmative and Paul Edwards and Al Buchanan will speak on the negative side of the question. xxx The question of oratory continues to be prominent in the school. A committee com posed of James Glpe. Gladys Nehrbas, Ed win Friend and George Posey recently in terviewed the principal, but when they were asked regarding the outcome of their talk "they knew nothing about the ques tion." The committee held the interview with the idea of obtaining a change in the method of passing on the orations and also regarding an out-of-town contest. The students are eager to have the next contest away from here, but whether or not the authorities would approve of this is a ques tion. However, it Is believed that the in terview above mentioned was entirely satis factory and that a change in passing on the manuscripts will be made, and that the content will in all probability take place out of the city.

IN THE EIGHTH DISTRICT MAYOR mLAI OF AMJEIlSOX, MAY TRY FOR CONGRESS. Col. W. W HnfTtnnn Talks Politic nt the Columbia CIu1 Gos sip of Hotel Lobbies. Col. W. W. Huffman, of Anderson, who was chief clerk of the State Senate at the last session, was at the Columbia Club yes terday. Colonel Huffman is still in politics and is making an active canvass for the nomination for county clerk of Madison county. Ex-Senator A. E. Harlan, of Alex andila, is also a candidate for the nomi nation. Colonel Huffman lives in the Eighth district, where the congressional situation is becoming decidedly interesting to poli ticians. Anderson has a candidate for congres sional honors in the person of Mayor Dun lap. In discussing the situation yesterday Colonel Huffman said: "Is is my judg ment that Madison county will be solid for Mayor Dunlap. I consider him one of the most eloquent men of Indiana and a man who would make his mark in Con gress. The question of who will go back to Congress, I think, rests with Delaware county. If Mr. Cromer loses that county he will probably be defeated. If success ful in that county, I think no one can beat him. There will probably be two candi dates; from Delaware county. Judge Iefler is being talked of. but l as never announced his candidacy. A good many of Senator Walter Ralls friends are urging him to make the race. It Is probable that cither Ball or Dunlap will make the race against Cromer. The Republican party in Madison county is in excellent condition and is in perfect harmony. All of the cities in our county will undoubtedly elect full Repub lican tickets next spring. George Nlchol, one of our old-time Republicans, and a man who stands high in business, will prob ably be the candidate for mayor to succeed Dunlap. There is no trouble with organized labor In Madison county and all our factories are running full time. In conversation with one of our principal contractors the other day he said there had been more building In Anderson during the past year than dur ing any year In its history. He said the in dications for the year 1902 are greater than in the past year. All of our merchants say they have had the best year's business in their history." . A LOCOMOTIVE EXPERT. W. J. Hartman, of the Monon. Chats About Modern Enslnes. W. J. Hartman, traveling engineer for the Monon system, is at the Denlson Ho tel. Mr. Hartman has charge of the en gineers and firemen employed by the Mo non. lie is here to examine four firemen for promotion. Mr. Hartman was for sev eral years connected with the Westing house Air Brake Company as mechanical expert. "The competition for traffic is commanded by equipment, comfort and speed," he said last night. "In view of these facts the railroads are designing lo comotives and-trains of unusually large dimensions and weights and especially with reference to the ability of locomotive boil ers for generating steam. They have reached a proportion of one square foot of heating surface for every six and one half inches of total piston displacement for engines having 73 to TS-inch diameter four-coupled tlriving wheels. The boilers on the engines known as the Chatauqua type, plying between Indianapolis and Chi cago on our lines, are designed to safely carry two hundred pounds pressure per square inch. On this account special valves for handling the pressure have been designed. On our road we have two new engines of the above type. They are haul ing opr heaviest passenger trains on sched ule time with perfect ease and when be hind time they attain a gait of from sixty five to seventy miles an hour. "The indications are that steam locomo tives will yet be designed to run at a ninety-mile speed. The modern locomotive is supplied with an 800-candle power are headlight and about fourteen eight-candle power incandescent lights so arranged that when the train takes the side track the arc headlight Is switched out and the in candescents lit up so that the engineer can Inspect all the parts of his machinery without the aid of fiambeau or torch. An opposing train can discover an electric headlight five to eight miles distant on a straight track." 3IADISOX NO SLOW TOWN'. School Superintendent McDanlel lie- Henta the Imputation. "People over the State are sometimes In clined to sneer at the city of Madison and call it a slow town," said Superintendent C. M. McDanlel, of the Madison city schools, at the Hotel English last nlfht. "I resent the insinuation that Madison is a slow town, because I have lived there long enough to rind out better. In the last few years a number o factories have lo cated there, and deals are on as a result of which others will locate there. The County Commissioners a few days ago de cided to buy the toll roads of the county, thus doing away with the last relic of early days, and opening a free communication with the surroifndirg towns. The people generally are united in advancing the best interests of Madison. "There is great interest being shown In the schools of Madison, which are doing substantial work. A free Industrial organ ization is being, organized for the purpose of Introducing certain lines of manual training in the grades. The work will start in a modest way by the introduction of sewing and domestic economy. The ex penses will be met by free contributions of the .organization, and no expense will be added to the taxes of the patrons. Next year a complete commercial department will be added to the High School. Short hand, typewriting, bookKeeping and com mercial geography and commercial arith metic will form a part of the course. In this way the schools will not only prepare the boys and girls for college, but give them preparation for the more active pur suits of business." I N I) I A X A N E W S PA I E 1 1 M E . Executive Committee of the Associa tion lloldn Meeting;. The executive committee of the Asso ciated Dailies of Indiana held a meeting at the Denlson Hotel last night to devise plans by which an interest among the pro prietors and managers of the daily news papers of the State outside of this city can be aroused.
