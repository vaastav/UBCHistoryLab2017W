The supreme court of the United States seems to be patterned after the nigger's coon trap "set to ketch 'em gwine an' cumin'." That august bodv has just decided: First That goods Imported from the Philippines into the United States cannot be taxed, because the Philip pines arc American territory. Second That goods exported from the United States to Porto Rico can be taxed, because Porto Rico is Amer ican territory. The apparent startling contradic tion of the ruling iiijthe Philippine case and that in the Forto Rico case is explained away by the Foraker act, says the Kansas City World. When the supreme court says the Foraker act makes a difference, it goes with out contradiction. The layman will find it hard to understand how if Porto Rico is domestic territory duty can be levied on imports, even if for the benefit of the temporary government of the island, any more than one state could levy a tax on goods shipped in from another state. Some laymen, too, will fail to see clearly just why either Porto Rico or the Philippines should l)e considered part of the United States, when the Porto Rcians and the Filipinos are not recognized as American citizens. These things are questions too deep for the minds of the laymen, how ever. The layman only applies com mon sense to such problems, whereas a knowledge of the intricacies of the law and (if politics is required. ' Learned men of the legal profession are busy interpreting the supreme court dccisiuii for the benefit of the simple minded people. Up to date the consensus of opinion is: That the United States has the authorityto consider the insular "p. sessions" foreign ordomestic territory, just as it sees tit, and in consequence that it has the power to enforce any or all of the tariff regulations against either, both, or neither, at its own Bweet will. . In view of this lucid explanation it will be seen that the supreme court of the United States is eminently correct in its most recent decisions, and the unfortunate layman who is so thick headed as to inquire for further par ticulars should go way back. Mr. Roosevelt'. Messtge. ' The much discussed message or President Roosevelt, the first of hl administration, has been submitted to congress ind through the medium of the press has been giveu to tne country. The paper is particularly noted for its volubility and certainly could have been shortened with advan- tagc both to the writer and to those who were unfortunate ' enough to be forced to peruse It. To those people who expected the recommendation of Innovations in re publican management disappointment came. The message throughout breathes of a disposition to break away from the republican idea of ln.miwa! tvt in administering the affairs of the government, but over riding and controlling that disposition the effect of the application of the partv lash manifests Itself so plainly that Mr. Roosevelt's declarations of patriotism savor of humor. Take, for instance, the matter of the trusts. According to public ut terance made by this man before he became president or tne umiea States the country had just reason to expect of him, at least, a recom mendation regarding these unholy combinations of wealth that paralyze trade, shut out competition and stifle American manhood, that would mean something a recommendation to the point and declaring that so far as it was in his power he was determined to give the people relief from the clutches of this devouring beast of prey. In stead, Mr. Roosevelt goes into a long drawn out discussion in which he takes both sides of the question. He recommends trust control by the legislatures of the states and the con. gress, but at the same time he urges caution lest the business affairs of the country be injured. In the discussion 1 of this particular question of vast public moment Mr. Roosevelt employs hundreds of words to no effect leaving the reader to guess as to how the chief executive of the nation stands on the trust issue. To place the seal of absolute insin cerity on the president's inferred de sire to regulate trusts we must follow him In a discussion of the tariff ques- ion. He declares outright for a con tinuation of protection for protection's sake and savs that the tariff must not be "tinkered with" by congress. recommendations in the message that are patriotic and will have the support of all, but thej are questions of minor importance when .compared to wwe that reach to our every aay me extort money from us wiih which to further replenish the purses or tnose whn have already errowu so wealthy that thev are euabled to control national administrations of the world a greatest government. Consistency. Oh. Consistency. nr,t nrounrvnt Ion SHOUld UC undertaken at once and systematically i The treed of a few should not oe allowed to Interfere with the good of the many." What splendid, patriotic reasoning Is found In the above declaration, to be found In Mr. Roosevelt's message to congress. "The greed of the few should not 1 allowed to mieriere with the good of the many." Ameri canism, pure and simple. But is it not strange that Mr, Roosevelt should only seek to apply this rule to the matter of our forests while at the same time he declares for a protective system that enriches the classes and pauperizes the masses? We fail to see the force of the president s tender solicitude for the welfare of the public regarding forestry, while at Ihe same time he upholds legalized rob bery along other lines. Mr. Roosevelt should attend school of consistency. discusses reciprocity with a vagueness most amusing, evidently intending through this offer of meaningless sop to soothe the anger of the American people anger created by continuous raids on the contents of their pockets by the tariff barons of the east who Major Park s Candidate. Major Tom Park, of Platte county, one of Missouri's best known and most highly respected citizens, cer tainly believes in the old adage that 'the early bird eets the worm." An exchange says: Major T. W. Park, of Tlatte county has announced his candidacy for the democratic nomination for railroad and warehouse commissioner. There will be two vacancies in the board of railroad commissioners to be filled at the election in November. The term of T. J. Hennessey will end In Janu ary, 1!02, and the appointment of Joseph Rice to take the place made vacant by the death of Joseph Her rington was to I only until a suc cessor could lc elected. Major Park Is a candidal fur the long term of six years to succeed Mr. Hennessey. In the convention of litoo .Major rarK was very nearly successful in receiving the nomination that went to Joseph Herrington, and until the final lwllot was the leading candidate before the He convention. Mr. Roosevelt In his message to congress advises the regulation of trusts, but says that protection is a good thing and should not be "tink ered" with by congress. That the president has given ear to, the Revenue From Missouri. "Missouri's importance in the union is again attested to by the fact that this state, according to the annual re port of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, stands as one of the seven foremost revenue-producing common wealths and is surpassed by but one in the amount of internal revenue con tributed in proportion to population, says the Republic. The showing thus made is also in dicative of the increasing prosperity of Missouri. Coming at a time when the state has just attracted national attention by a record-breaking win ning of medals for the best state ex hibits at the Pan-American Exposi tion, and when St. Louis, the Mis souri metropolis, surpassed all Ameri can cities in an official showing of business gains, the rank taken by Mis souri as a revenue-producer for the nation is in keeping with the story of the state's material advancement in all lines. These repeated evidences of the growing wealth and development of Missouri and of ,St. Louis will attract a wider attention now than ever be fore. Because of the World's Fair, this state is receiving an international scrutiny of exceptional keenness . There is a natural desire to accurately Icarn the conditions existing in the Wirld's Fair state and city. Mis. Kourians have cause to lie proud of the showing made.

The manly thing for the republican party to do is to throw off all disguise j people extraordinarily gullible.

He should recover-every penny of the money, for such snobbery needs pun- jhiimcnt. roclty for the free-trader, leaving each individual case to stand on its own bottom. This is In line with repub lican policy. That party never framed a tariff bill on any other principle than a division of the spoils among the largest contributors. "From bis speeches, loth during the campaign ana aricr, we naa a rigni to expect a more vigorous handlingof the trus question. 1 lie argument is atxnit equally balanced Ix'tween necessity for action and the Gangers tnat may follow It.

On the matter of the ship subsidy steal the president talks as though fortifying himself with a logical ex cuse no matt er which way he may fall later on. In favoring the upbuilding of the merchant marine Mr." Roosevelt does not commit himself to to Mr. Manna's scheme; at Hie aauui lime, he does not say It Is a steal.

Such Is the language that was penned by the Immortal Jefferson as a part of the Declaration oi iuw pendence of these United States In which we live an instrument signed by patriots who In signing not only Invited confiscation of property dui death under the charge of treason to the British crown. what, lnsnirlnir motives moved these lovers of their country. Prlva tion, war and death were preferable to unjust government. A love of country as deep as the fathomless ocean and as Immovable as the Rock of Gibraltar alone could have actuated them. Their's were words written to urge men on to a higher civilization and grander systems of government during the centuries to come words so plethoric of patriotic devotion to the principles that all men are born free and equal that perforce their mis sion, logically carried out, was to de velop the grandest republic the world has ever known. The bloodshed that followed, the tear of the wife dropped on the departure of country-loving husband for the scenes of conflict and the snows of Valley Forge, the cry of the child from hunger and the wasted feature of the infant that nursed at the breast of half starved yet patri otic mother, were mere incidents of war. The hero was the colonist w ho took up his flint and steel and went forth to meet the hosts of Britain and contest their right to foothold on the ground he called home. Death faced him but he dared to do, because w hat he did was the right. The great men of the colonies had signed their names to the Instrument declaring for Inde- pendence. All could not sign, but they could tight. And. thank God through their patriotic struggle, the roar of the British lion was driven from our land and our Independence recognized by the powers of the world. But now comes the story from Washington that the lettering on this grand and glorious Instrument that spoke out so boldly for freedom from oppression of as noble a people as ever sought to govern themselves, is fading away. Though written on parchment and carefully preserved as much so as possible the inspiring words penned by Mr. Jefferson have 60 far dimmed that only a small part of the paper as a whole can now be read. Is the hand of God in this work? Can it be that since we have failed to live up to the spirit of the Declaration of Independence Providence has willed to wipe It away from the face of the parchment upon which it was origi nally written rather than have It live and the memory of the men who signed it Insulted each successive day by governmental encroachments upon the sacred rights declared for therein by a political party that has tossed patriotism to the winds and turned its attention to oppression, loot? It were better for the signers of this much loved document that they died in the enjoyment of the fulfillment of their greatest hope with the consol ing knowledge that their plea that all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed" had licen put Into practl cable, tangible form and tiecomc so firmly planted that the people of all nations must stand by and see it de. clop Into the full fruition of the greatest government 'neath the sun Could these men have lived until to day they would have looked heaven ward and cried out, "My country, Oh my country." If It tie that thpy know of conditions that now exist under the government they establish ed, then must there be unrest In heaven as they look down and view the encroachments of organized wealth through channels of class legis lation that serve to pauperize the i masses of those men whom they de clared to have lx'ou lxirn free and equal. So radical have U-cn the changes, with such determined per sistence lias the republican partv drifted from patriotic statesmanship to legalized commercial robbery, that we should not wonder if the hand of Providence bad busied Itself in wiping away from the public gaze the names of Ihe patriots who were ac tiittted;tby love of country alone In signing this priceless declaration of our freedom in order to protect them from the future gaze of vulgar politi cal Jolliers mid tricksters, by some men called statesmen, and who seem to have gotten hold of this govern, ment.
