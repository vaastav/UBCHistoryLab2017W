STATEHOOD FOR NW MEXICO" We favor the Immediate admission of the territories of New Mexico and JLrlsona as separate states In the Union. Republican National Platform. tTfie President and Statenood It has been known for many months that President Roosevelt would ad vocate the admission of New Mexico and Arisona to statehood as separate atatea. In his message to the present session of Congress. Therefore, the em phatic statement which he made yesterday that he favored statehood at the bands of the short session of Congress, was no surprise, although It was very pleasing to the people of the Southwest. "I advocate the admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states. This should be done at the present session of Congress " was the way the presi dent's message was worded, as told in the news columns of the Citizen last evening. Coupled with the fact that the president-elect. Mr. Taft, and the mem bers of the cabinet, together with nearly all of the most powerful members of Congress have declared themselves In favor of statehood, the president's message takes on new significance. It Is well known to the people of New Mexico that the delegate, Gov ernor Curry, Mr. Luna and other well known New Mexicans, are already In the national capital doing everything In their power to secure statehood from this session of Congress. They are sanguine of success and conditions at pres ent are very favorable. It Is a good time now, to forget politics and every resident of the Southwest should unite In working for admission to the Union. The strong stand which the president has taken In his message wili greatly add to our chances for admission at the short session and the Citizen believes that we will be successful. The mailer ui building an adequate sewer system for Albuquerque Is one that cannot longer be postponed. The only question Is as to the most ad visable method of procedure. The city council and other city officials who re charged with the duty, should give the question due consideration, but the matter should not be delayed for long. There Is no question of politics In thla proposition and it does not matter how the sewer system Is secured, b that It Is done In a business like manner, with due economy and with am ple accommodations for the needs of the people. The sewer system Is badly needed and the delay will prove much more costly than proper sewerage In the long run. Business and health both demand that the proposition be taken up at the earliest possible moment and this paper hopes that the city 'Officials will proceed with all possible haste. .Religious fanatics, known as "Holy Rollers," or Mine such a name, kill ed a policeman and seriously wounded several other officers in Kansas City yesterday. In a return Are, the officers dangerously wounded one of the leaders of the band and killed a young girt. Many things pass for religion la these days, but the religion that goes armed with pistols. Is not one that can be considered an eld to civilization. Religious freedom la undoubtedly "the foundation of this 'country, but there should be some definition of re ligion in the exercise of such freedom and a six-shooter ought not to be the chaiice of Its altar. The Boston Transcript comments upon statehood In the following unique manner, which however, is interesting now that the question of a new name for this territory has been suggested: If New Mexico with Arizona Is admit ted under its present name there will be eight states with an Initial M and eight iNs; the News and the Norths being chiefly responsible for the latter list. There will also be four Wi, four Is. three Os, three As, three Cs, and two each of Ks, Ts. Ss. and Vs. while the seven remaining letters of D, P, , U, G, F, and L, will be represented by a state each.

A new meth od of payment to the railroads for the transportation of malls is to be come effective February 1, 1909. In stead of payments for this service quarterly, the roads are to be paid In the same manner the government discharges its other obligations, on.e each month. The eHtlmAterl rpvcniia rtaM the roads for the year 1908 le $48,000,-! ' 000. The new system will mean timt $4,000,000" will be put Into circula tion every month Instead of $12,000, 000 every quarter. The payments for 1909 will be on the same weight basis as 1908. Although the railroads have been required to file with the postofflce department their vouchers on which the payments are made monthly, the payments were made quarterly. The new system will ave the roads a great deal of labor, besides allowing them the use of the money two months sooner than was granted them under the old system.
