It is alleged by the plaintiff that Mr. Dehare made false KÄÄ! h f # , Pr l' Pert ?i^ and ing that there was part of it cleared land, and that it was well fenced, and that a ers large six roomed dwelling house was of erected upon it. Under these statements it appears that Mr. Grier was induced to go, leaving a lucrative position at Du Font's powder works. Ou reaching Wisconsin lio found that " he had been imposed upon. What had been renresenjd to Elm « being bis farm lie found it to ho next to a wilder ness—wild and rocky, overgrown with work thicketn and not fences—and above all, upon looking for the six roomed man «ion, they in lieu thereof a few timbers 8 that were evidently the remains of an old log cabin.

The civil list was taken up ami a Jury «mpauneled in the case of George Abele vs. Robert Taylor. This wj 1303 and and and all and ary is est a few days previous in Milwaukee, through death— as soon as possible started for Wilming ton. This suit is an action to recover dam ages for loss sustained. Levi Bird is counsel for the plaintiff*, and Messrs Whiteley and Pepper coun sels for the defendant. The hearing of the caso commenced, with Wm. Logue as the first witness, who testified at considerable length ; he went to Wisconsin in company with the plaint ill*, and was cognizant of the facts as net forth in his complaint. His evi dence not being concluded at the noon recess, Court adjourned Hntil three o'clock. and for AFTERNOON SESSION. Court reassembled at three o clock, and Wm .Logue was recalled and testified: Had a conversation with Dehare this morning, but nothing was said to me about what to say. Wilmer Palmer sworn—Was a freight agent on the W. A W. railroad; this Is tlio receipt I signed for the goods, (examining the paper.) Frank Strickland sworn—I saw the lease d saw it signed by the parties; tills (ex amining the lease,) is my signature. John Olhbiuson sworn—Testified as to Uriur being in the employ of DuPonts. The counsel of plainiiif here rested the case. Mr. Whiteley, counsel for the defence, applied for a non suit, and brought forth numerous authorities to strengthen his plea. The foundation upon which the lion was based was that the defendant was entirely ignorant of the state of the land as described. The court could see no reason to grant the request und it was refused. Mr. Pepper, upon opening for the de fence, said lie would endeavor to prove such inducements as that tiiere are said to have been held up; that he, the Lire land and w defendant, never ?ver there. Con Dugan sworn—Work at tire cooi: shops at DuPonts; have beon on the land Mr. Delian ; never knew of him being there: The property was helred to him from ins lather. 1 was tiiere In 1861. I knew Grier had been to Delian in regard to the property; he (Grier,) came to me and said that Delian sent him. saying that 1 knew more about the land than lie did; told him there was a house and stable on it; didn't tell him what kind. Cross-examined—Went out lo cle; used to ride around to see what the country looked like; knew Dehan and his uncle corresponded; had heard Dehan say that ills uncle overlooked the land and paid tiie taxes; the house was a log house, one story high and two rooms; no person lived in it; it was not fit to live in; tiiere won* mountains on the edge of the land stream running through it called of in to my un and Bear creek. John Dehan sworn—Am a son of the de fendant; live with my father at Front and Van Buren streets In Wiiminaton; know Mr. Grier; I think this (a letter written in the French language from tho uncle ot De to his neighbor,) is tho letter I heard my father read to Mr. Grier; It was re id to him (Mr. Grier,) iu English; there is no special mark, hut I know It by its heading and by its being written in red ink. Upon Mr. Whiteley proposing to have it Interpreted, Mr. Bird objected. Mr Bird— commencing to give tho rea of bis objections—''i don't know what Is in this letter." , , Judge Wnotten— 1 "Well, why don't you read it then 7" [Laughter.] It was ilnally decided that the letter should bo read in order that it might be Identified by the hoy. Mr. F. X. Januet coming forward was interrogated by the court. Judge—"Where were you born ?" Mr. J.—"In Franco." Judge—'"in what direction?" Mr j —"In the direction of the Khlne.

LETTER FROM SAM'L TOWNdEJSD est For the Delaware Gazette. Mr. Editor—I n looking over your paper one day last week 1 saw a com*, munication copied from the Baltimore Suu, that had been sent to that paper from California, on Beet Sugar and Mel Sugar, molasses and oil from the seed of'the melon. Now, sir, I hope you will keep this California communication your paper two or three weeks and request all other owners of newspapers the State to do the same, as it will, I think, cure a godtl many persons who showed symptoms of sugar beet mania; and there are very few things in this world but what have been discovered and tried a long time ago. Poland, in his ancient history, says travelers in Egypt discovered ruins of cities, with masterpieces of sculpture and painting, that had existed long before authentic history began. And there is no doubt that everything that sugar or molasses could be made out of had been tried thousands of years ago, and the people settled down to cane of the various kiuds. Sugar cane, as it is called, pro duces the best. Chinese sorghum, as it is called, is a pretty good substitute, and the sap of a certain kind of maple tree, and in Ohio some kind of apple trees are grown on purpose to raise sweet apples to make cider to boil down to mo lasses. This California writer says sugar beets rot and the molasses is insipid, and tlie making of sugar beets is a failure, and then lets himself down and tries to get up a clap from the expiring beet rootists by recommending water melon sugar, syrup, and also oil out of the seeds, ami proposes to Delaware, Eastern dhore of Maryland, and Jersey, to get up a new excitement on this new great source of wealth—water melon sugar, molasses, the oil out of the seed, and the rinds as feed for stock. In said article, I think this California chap has dug the graves and buried all beet rootists, and should now put np their grave boards and draw a representation of a water melon near the lop of the board and a representation of a sugar beet directly below the melon, and might add the following lines: "Dela ware, Maryland and New Jersey, beware how you make appropriations for hum bugs." In this New Castle county mel ou raising is so uncertain and unprofita ble that farmers themselves find it to their interest to buy what melons they use from persons who grow them in lower Delaware, Maryland and Jersey.— I rather feel sorry for our Delaware beet rootists that their California brother in the beet root sugar business should have given them such a Paxharn shot between wind and water. They might as well strike their colors and give up the beet root humbug, as was done forty years ago. SAMUEL TOWNSEND. Townsend, Dec. 3, 1877. BOARD CF HEALTH.
