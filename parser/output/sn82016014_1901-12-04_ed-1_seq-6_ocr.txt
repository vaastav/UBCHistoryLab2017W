Brown, vice president and general manager of the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern rail way, with headquarters at Cleveland when asked for an expression of opinion of the president's message, as regards the development of the west. Bald: "I cannot express too strongly my ap preciation of the recommendation of the president looking to the reclamation of the now arid regions in our western states and territories bv the construe tion of great reservoirs for the storing or water. "The fact that the president favors the undertaking of this work by the general government is the logical re suit of his familiarity with conditions in tne west and his practical knowleage ot the subject under consideration. Tne work of reclamation of arid lands, undertaken in the comprehensive and thorough manner which its import ance not only justifies but demands win require a larger expenditure of money than the sparsely settled states of the west can command. Money for tnis purpose expended by the state must be raised by taxation: this is an obvious impossibility, therefore the only alternative left to the state or terri tory unaided by the general govern ment would be to farm out to great syndicates composed of eastern capital ists the right to construct the reser voirs, to own the water and to control the land reclaimed. Under this plan the settler seeKing a home upon govern ment land must pay tribute to the syn dicate thus formed, in such amount as the syndicate might elect to exact. "Each year a new generation of young men is being graduated from farms, villages and cities of the east and mid dle west; men who must find some lo cation for a home and some vocation by wnicn tney may become self-supporting. "For years the fertile prairies of Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota and the Dakotas have at tracted thousands of these homeseek ers and home makers. These states are rapidly filling up and soon the annual exodus of young men will look In vain for attractive opportunities for secur ing farms and homes in any of this territory. When this time comes, some territory must be found for this rising westward tide of civilization. "The one overshadowing cloud more portentous than any other today is the rapidly growing political representation and influence of the great centers of population, as against the country. The hop of the country is in the 40 !0 and 160 acre farm thousands of them owned and tilled by happy, prosperous American citizens, and in no way can this condition be brought about so speedily as by the government under taking at once the work of reclaiming and making fruitful and fertile the mil lions of acres of land now its property, but absolutely worthless without wa ter. "It Is well within the limits of ex treme conservatism to sav that 40 acres of irrigated land will produce on an average more than the best SO acres in the fertile valleys of the Mississippi and the Missouri. Personally, I believe that acre for acre the irrigated land may be depended upon to produce three times as much. Taking the former es timate, however, as a basis, and at tempt to compute the addition to the material wealth of this country which would result from the expenditure in this work of one-half the money which Is appropriated annually in the river and harbor bill, much of which (to put it very mildly) is spent without hope or expectation of return and the result will beggar comprehension. "But above and beyond the material features, consider the moral effect upon the character of the nation of filling the foothills and the valleys of the transmissouri states with the mul titudes of hardy pioneers and home- builders that would be attracted bv the field thus opened to them. No recommendation or suggestion has ever been made by a president more important than this or worthy of more caretui consideration, and I hoDe to see an appropriation for the reclama tion of the arid lands of the nation made as regularly as that for rivers and harbors, or for any other great and necessary worn ot the national govern ment, and that the appropriation will be commensurate in amount with the great importance of the work. 

HAVERHILL FLOPS. Socialists Lose City Government to the Republicans. Boston, Dec 4. Snow and rain made disagreeable election weather in four teen of the thirtv-three cities of Maasa. chusetts, when citizens were called upon to choose their city governments for next year. Of the fourteen cities, eleven went for license, a gain of one over last year, the change being in Fitchburg. The great feature of the elections as a whole was the remark able success of the Republican party, ten mayoralty candidates of that party winning, and carrying with them in nearly every instance a city council in sympathy with them. The party results were as follows: Marlboro, Republican; Northampton, Republican; Fall River, Republican; Taunton, Republican; Fitchburg, Inde pendent; Gloucester, independent Re publican; Lawrence, Democrat; New Bedford, Republican; Waltham, Repub lican; Haverhill, Republican; Brockton, Republican; Quincy, citizens'; Spring field, Republican; Pittsfield, Democrat.

Case Will Be Taken to Supreme Court. Oskaloosa, Kas., Dec. 4. A motion for a new trial in the Klusmire murder case has been overruled by Judge Gephart. All of the lawyers on both sides were present in the court room when court convened Tuesday, and Attorney Sidney Hayden, of Holton, made the speech for the defense in argument for a new trial. He gave in the course of his remarks about twenty reasons why a new trial should be allowed. He said that of course time had not permitted a tran script of all the testimony in the case to be made, and accordingly he was not able to speak from memory con cerning much of the testimony in the case, but there were some matters upon which he spoke at considerable length. one tning was his serious obiection to the admission of the testimony of the physicians as experts on behalf of the state, and he stated that a rule had been transgressed when these Dhvsi- eians, Drs. Tucker and Jermane, were permitted to invade the province of the jury by making statements concerning the effect of certain bruises matters which he claimed should have been left with the jury. He spoke also of what he considered an error in the rebuttal testimony. He stated that Drs. Tucker and Jermane were questioned in regard to the exam inations which they had made, and at the close of their testimony were asked if it included everything concerning which they had examined, and the re sponse was in the affirmative. Mr. Hayden then said that the de fense had brought Dr. Dean on the stand, and he testified that he had found the larynx in a collapsed condi tion, resulting as he thought from some harsh treatment. "Now," resumed Attorney Hayden, 'Drs. Tucker and Jermane were al lowed to give rebuttal testimony in re gard to an examination which they had previously been given an opportunity to testify in regard to. but which they had not mentioned. They were asked if they had examined the larynx and responded that they had, and were al lowed to testify that they had exami ned it by taking it up between their fingers. This I consider is an error, be cause they had failed to mention it in their first examination." Further the attorney stated that the state had failed to show that there was any evidence of malice in this case of Klusmire; that even if the theory of the state were true, it could have been only manslaughter in the third degree. There were other matters of which Mr. Hayden spoke one being, as he said, the failure of the court to have the verdict from the jury received in a proper way, saying that possibly it might seem a small matter, but he cited several instances where the supreme court had reversed cases upon matters which to a layman would appear as trivial; for instance, one case was re versed because the statutes were left n the Jury room over night: another case was when the journal of the court did not show tnat the bailiff had been properly sworn. He said In conclusion that there were many other matters which he might enumerate and many other items, but that these which he had mentioned were the principal errors upon which they expected a reversal of the case. Judge Gephart then made a few re marks wherein he stated that he re garded this as a very important case, and had consequently given it a great deal of careful thought, but that In his judgment no errors had been made, and that he overruled the motion for a new trial. County Attorney Graham of Jackson county then asked that the court defer the sentence until January 2, this was allowed with the exception of the change of date to December 31. This will give time for a transcript of the testimony in tne case to be made. Klusmire, who was present in the court room presented a rather un kempt appearance and he looked as if he had not been shaved for some time; he appeared weary, downhearted and discouraged. 

TAKE YOUR CHOICE Fort Scott's Peculiar Regula tion For Attorneys. Occupation Tax Ordinance Di vides Them Into Classes. IS LEFT TO TIIEM. May Enter Any of the Classes They Choose. First Class Costs $50 While Fourth Pays Only 5. Probably the most peculiar occupa tion tax ordinance ever prepared In Kansas is one that B. Hudson, city at torney of Fort Scott, is now preparing. The plan of the ordinance is drafted hut it is not yet all typewritten. Among its peculiar provisions will be a tax on lawyers and ministers by classification. Lawyers will he divided into four classes first, second, third and fourth. A first class lawyer will have to pay the city of Fort Scott $50 for the nrivilee-e of nrnoHnint.- low there. A second class lawyer will pay , anu tnira class 25, wnile fourth class lawyers will have to pay only $5. They are issued a license in which it is stated which class they belong to, but tney are allowed to choose their own Class. Hivery lawyer is renuired to nang ms license on the wall of his offlce in plain view, lust as nharma- cists are required to do with the phar maceutical certincates. Mr. Hudson expects this provision to Dnng a Dig revenue to the city. He does not expect that there will be any fourth class lawyers in Fort Scott. "AH the boys are getting ready to mortgage their libraries in order to get into tne nrst class, said Mr. Hudson today. "We will have more first class lawyers in Fort Scott when I get this ordinance to working than any other city in the country. There won't be a single fourth rate lawyer in the town. All you will have to do to find out what kind of a lawyer a man is will be to iook up his license. There you have his own word for it, and if he says he is nrst class it will cost him fifty dol lars. Mr. Hudson is here in company with E. S. Gates, another prominent Fort Scott attorney, looking after the Fort Scott poll tax case in the supreme court. The classification of ministers under Mr. Hudson's occupation tax will not be according to what kind of preachers tney are, but according to the salaries they receive. They will not be embar rassed by being required to give their own opinion of their sermons. It is not expected that this sort of requirement will embarrass a lawyer any, but with a preacher it is different. His tax will depend upon the salary he receives, or is alleged to receive. If he gets $1,000 or more a year nis tax will be $10. Otherwise he will get off free. "Donation parties and such things will not be counted," said Mr. Hudson, "and preachers who get only a bushel of turnips now and then or a dozen or so pairs of slippers at Christmas time will be let off easy. We may find out what congregations don't pay up their preachers." HALL IS ON TRIAL. 'Continued from First Page.) there?" "He was sent by Chief Stahl to taks care of Mr. Head." "What did Mr. Head do?"

Arthur Grissom, editor of The Smart Set, died today of typhoid fever in this city, aged 33 years. The defense will endeavor to prove that Head was resisting arrest and that Hall was justified in using his club. The prosecution will endeavor to show that Head was not resisting arrest, and that Hall was not warranted in using violence. In examining the jurors Attorney Ensminger, for the defense, asked the following questions: "Do you know Cash Curtis or Mat Cave? "Have you read the facts in this case? "Did you form an opinion from what you read? "Have you any prejudices against the police force? "Have you any prejudices against the city administration? "Have you any prejudice against the chief of police? "Have you any prejudice against Stahl's manner of enforcing the law as he interprets it? "If it came to a question of doubt whether the defendant was justifiable in making the arrest and of that un fortunate result was an accident, would you give the defendant the benefit of the doubt? "If it is shown that Cash Curtis and Mat Cave are behind this prosecution would that prejudice your mind? "If there is a doubt as to the motives which prompted the act will you give tne aeienaant tne Denent or tne doubt? For the prosecution Attorney Nichols asked the following questions: "Would the fact that the defendant is a police officer cause you to give him more favor than an ordinary citizen? "Have you any scruples against the enrorcement or tne death penalty?" The jury was secured at noon. MRS.

"He said, 'Honest to God, Mattie, I haven't done a thing; that man just struck and beat me.' " "What did you say?" "I asked Hall if he struck him." "What did he say?"
