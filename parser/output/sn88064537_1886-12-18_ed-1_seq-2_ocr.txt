The Correspondence on the Fisheries Qnc» : tion Submitted to the Senate—TI10 Presi dent Intimates That lie May Have Some thing Kurt her to Communicate — Secre tary Bayard's Letter to the President. I W ashington , Dec. 9.—Yesterday after ! noon President Cleveland sent to the Sen ate a letter from the Secretary of State, ' accompanied by the correspondence in re ! lation to the rights of American fishermen I in the British North American waters. In his letter of transmittal the President says: "I commend to your favorable considera j tion the suggestion that a commission be j authorized to take perpetuating proofs of j the losses sustained during the past year : by American fishermen owing to the un friendly and unwarranted treatment by I the local authorities of the maritime I provinces cf the Dominion of Canada. Î may have occasion hereafter to make fur j ther recommendations during the present I session for such remedial legislation as ; may become necessary for the protection j of the rights of our citizens engaged in ! the North American Atlantic waters." j The following is the letter of the Seere ! tary of State: Department of State, i Washington . Dec. h . ihm . ( To the President : The Secretary of State has the honor to submit to the President with a view to its communication to Congress the correspondence relative to the fisheries in the waters adjacent to British North America, which has taken place during the present year. It will disclose the action of this Depart ment and of our Minister to Great Britain in relation to the disputed construction of the convention of 

ISIS, and what has been done to procure such an interpretation of its provisions as will be acceptable to both parties to that in strument and consistent with their mutual in terest and honor. From time to time since the conclusion of the ireaty of 1H18, differences have arisen between j : lie two governments as to the extent of the j renunciation by the United States of their ! former fishing rights in common in the littoral i waters of British North America, and the true I definition of the rights and privileges retained j by and expressly guaranteed to the United ! States in the first articles of that convention. ! The history of this question during the period ! from IHis to the present time has been of un successful attempts to adjust, the respective j claims, and occasionally the difficulties have i been bridged over by temporary arrangements j —notably by the treaty of Washington of June j 5, IHM, and of the treaty of Washington of May : ft, 1871 —the fishery articles of the latter having I been abrogated by the United States on June j 30. iks.",. ! It is deeply to be regretted that the efforts of I this department, as shown by the -correspond j ence now submitted, to arrive at su.ch an agree i ment as would permit instructions cf like ten j or to be issued by the Governments of Great I Britain and the United States, to guide the cit I zens of the respective nationalities.in the un j molested exercise of their rights of fishing in ; the waters in question arid defining the ! limits of lawful action therein, have not as yet } reached a final and satisfactory result. Al though those propositions are now pending for consideration which it is hoped may prove th€ basis of a just and permanent settlement, yet as supplementary to the published history of this long standing subject, and as illus trating the obvious necessity in the interest of amity and good neighborhood, of having a clear and well-defined understanding of the relative rights of the two Governments and their respective citizens, it is considered expedient that Congress should have full knowledge of the action of the executive in the t premises to assist them in their deliberations ' upon this important subject. It will be observed in the course of this corre spondence that notification has not failed to be duly given to the Government of Great Britain, that compensation is expected for the loss and damage caused to American fisherman by the unwarrantable action of the local authorities of the Dominion of Canada, not merely by the summary seizure of their vessels and the exaction of heavy fines in advance of hearing and judgment, but for the curtailment of privileges, to which they were justly entitled under commencial regula tions. as well as treaty stipulation ; and the consequent interference with their legitimate voyages, whereby the natural profits of their industry were seriously diminished and in many cases wholly destroyed. It would seem proper that steps in perpetuam rei menioriam should be taken by congress to allow proofs to be made and placed upon reco rd of these Josses and injuries to our citizens to enable ?hemto be properly presented to Her Majesty's Government for settlement, and that for this purpose a commission should be authorized by Congress to take the necessary proofs of the .•espective claimants. Respectfully submitted, [Signeal t. p. Bayard. The accompanying correspondence is very voluminous and consists of letters from Secretary Bayard to Ministers West and Phelps: those of Minister Phelps to the Earl of Roseberrv, and his replies— and the Earl of Roseberry's communica tion to Minister West. The letters of Sec retary Bayard to Minister West are at times diplomatically vigorous. The fol lowing paragraph occurs in his letter of May 39, 1885: '•I have telegraphed Mr. Phelps, our Minister at London, to make earnest pro test to Her Majesty's Government against such arbitrary, unlawful, unwarranted and unfriendly action on the part of the Canadian Government and its officials, and have instructed Mr. Phelps to give no tice that the Government of Great Britain would be held liable for all losses and in juries to citizens of the United States and their property, caused by the unauthoriz ed and unfriendly action of the Canadian, officials to which I have referred." In concluding a letter of October 19. he «ays: "If, as 1 can not permit myself to believe, Great Britain should refuse to citizens of the United States the plainest and most undeniable of these righs, (the rights under ancient treaties), the conse quence will be so serious that they can not be contemplated by the Government but with great concern." The character of Earl Roseberry's com mutation is elaborately, explanatory and placating. Assurances are given of the British Goverhments desire to do all that may be necessary for the adjustment of the existing difficulties. « Short 111 His Cash Account.
