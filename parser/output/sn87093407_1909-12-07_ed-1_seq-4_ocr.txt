•a r.:";,:,'--.::™..:;::: THE STAR EDITORIAL AND MAGAZINE PAGEi'^^iMA ,na • _ ° Taft—His Exciting Message President Taft's first regular message to congress is strictly 'in accord with our conception of th. personality of the author, It is n smoothly written, placid document, couched in sonorous generalities and breathing an air of adipose optimism, such a** hvotib! naturally he expected from a peace-loving, self-satisfied Juan. " The message is peculiar in what it does not say, more so than by reason of what it docs. The larger questions of gov ernment and policy which are now engaging earnest public attention have been reset for other occasions and separate treatment, leaving for consideration today those matters of polity on which the president has often expressed his views and .about which there has never been any - serious dis agreement. Apprehension over the possible domination of Manchuria by Japan has never beta poignant or general; of the Niearaguan difficulty we have been well informed "by the daily press; our interest in the Congo has been sentimental and academic; the North Pacific seal question interests ua but slightly; tit re duction in the running expenses of the government will meet with approval, -it hardly in proportion to the figure- given. 'As- to old age industrial pensions, postal savings banks, the •accelerating and cheapening "' civil and criminal justice, restrictions on the nuance of injunctions, revision of second class mail rat.- all these arc old presidential standby*, They arc tin- "property" subjects, treated mot, or leas expansively in every message, having been carefully handed down froirt administration to administration unimpaired. The latest presidential message, eviscerated to liii- extent. is left but a shell in which there is small matter for expectation or consolation. In conclusion the president deals with the increased cost of living in a rather amateurish fashion. His reference to this topic is for the purpose of justifying the new tariff law, and absolving it from all blame for the disparity between the in come and outgo of that unfortunate who bears the euphemistic name of the "ultimate consumer." Here again the Taft penchant for generalities asserts itself to no good purpose. It has long since been recognized that errors lurk in generalities, even fraud and deceit. The man who cannot strike a proper balance be tween what he earns and what he expends will pass the presi dent's views on this question as unimportant. «From any other executive than President Taft, this mes sage would have * been a disappointment. As it is, it. is negligible. -' People with charitable memories Nlcsrssnui. with some justice, will not a recall 'that the weather looks upon the #«-eretiir> of state j forecast for yesterday was "rain as one who Knox. t Looks as If we were Ruing to .. _ b. .. ... ... . bmXm sn open winter. doesn't It?
