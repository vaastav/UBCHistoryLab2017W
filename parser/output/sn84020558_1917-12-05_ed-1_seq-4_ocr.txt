DECEMBER B, 1917 There is no danger of a spirit of militarism manifesting itself in a icountry which has no desire for con quest. Anonymous. The Message The outstanding feature of the president's mes sage, read to congress yesterday, was its uncompro mising attitude toward the enemies of civilization. It is evident that whatever may have been thought, or may he thinking In the chancelleries of Europe regarding peace terms, the president has given them no consideration, and is not now in a temper to accept or offer terms which do not include the permanent powerlessness of Prussianism to plunge the world into a sea of blood again. In this respect, the message is a reiteration of that which preceded the declaration of a state of war against Germany. The message contains on that score, nothing new. It makes it the more difficult for us to join in any compromise with Germany for the ending of the war. Even if the unexpected should happen, and France and Great Britain, brought to their knees should be forced to consent to a peace which could only be temporary, the United States is barred hf the message from participation in such a peace. In this attitude, the president reflects the sentiment of the American people. The president's recommendation for a declaration of war asainst Austria was forseen. In fact, it was unavoidable any longer. The developments of the Italian campaign forced such a recommendation. Why a similar one was not made as to Turkey and Bul garia is not explained. It was probably withheld by the president in the hope, which must be a slender one at the best, that those countries, dissatisfied with their alliance with the Central Powers, may of them selves, sever that relation. It must be admitted that If there Is such a prospect of which we have no sign, a declaration against them would drive them more closely to the alliance. But against the probability, or rather, the possi bility of their falling away of their own weight from the Central I'owers, we have the danger of the con tinued presence of their representatives at the na tional capital, with opportunities for fpyir.g, and the contingency that in the kaleidoscope of the war, we may be brought face to face with their armies in the field. It is only in the neg'.cct to recommend a declara tion of war against these powers that the American people can find fault with the message. Hold the War Bonds It has been noticed that the Liberty Bonds are figuring in the reports of the New York Stock Ex change. The 3'i's were reported soon after the sub scriptions were taken last summer and before the bonds themselves had been issued. The 4's which were subscribed only a little more than a month ago were quoted on the exchange before the subscription period ended. The 4's yesterday were quoted at 37.90 end 57.82; the S'i's at 9S.90 to 93. In ail parts of the country we suppose in every town. Liberty Bonds in small volume, of course, may be exchanged for merchandise at their face value and thousands of the bonds have been so exchanged. We suppose in many cases holders of the bonds have been forced by necessity to part with them but in most cases there has been no such necessity only convenience has been served. Buyers of Liberty Bonds, as a rule, did not pur- chase them in the way of speculation. While it is true that the bonds could reasonably be expected some time to bring more than par, the interest rate was so low that It was not attractive. The purchase of the bonds was undertaken as a patriotic duty. But the man who purchased them and then immediately sold them, by the latter act undid all that he had done; he might as well not have purchased them in the first place. The government, of course, has received or will receive the money for all the purchases, but the un loading of these bonds on the market, wil have a bad effect on future government offerings. The people at large, and it is the people at large who It was desired should take these bonds, would naturally be adversely influenced by the market fig ures of the two issues of Liberty Bonds. The av erage man unfamiliar -with bonds cannot see why a government security should sell at a discount. To him It appears there is a lack of confidence, if not In the government, at least in the security, as an in vestment. He does not take into account the inability of the market to absorb all offerings at once the natural operation of the law of supply and demand. It Is absolutely certain that these bonds will some time bear a premium, but it was unreasonable to expect that a premium would attach to them at once. If there had been such a demand as was necessary to raise them to a premium immediately it would have satisfied itself by original purchases of the bonds. It P. as reasonably expected though that the 3'V would quickly be sought on account of the im munity ftom sur-tax feature, and it is that feature that now holds them so nearly at par in spite of the heavy offerings. Undoubtedly but for this unexpected Influx these bonds would now be sought at a good premium. - It is a prime necessity to the purposes (and re quirements of the government that these bonds be distributed among, and absorbed by, the people whose savior we not likely to be merged with great ac cumulations of capital for carrying on th country's business. These saving may be large or small. They may be sufficient for the purchase only of a single bond or they may be great enough for the purchase of thousands of them. The confidence of tlie peo ple in these bonds as an investment must be main tained. The bonds which have been, thrown upon the market have not come from small, individual holders, bu generally, from banks and other financial insti tutions which, under the spur of the Liberty Loan drive took them. It is urged now that instead of un loading them in this manner which produces tw.o evil effects, that of hammering down the value of the bonds, and that of encroaching upon the country's accumulated tSpital, they continue to distribute them among the people that they may be absorbed by cur rent saving. A Belated Flirtation A belated dispatch from Petrograd describes Bulgaria's aspirations for an extension of territory and a willingness to enter into negotiations with the entente looking to such an accomplishment. A con versation between one eminent Bulgarian and a dip lomat whose name is witheld is repeated. In it a hope is held out to the Bulgarians of not only the preservation of the integrity of Bulgaria but of the acquisition of the Dobrudja for the loss of which Rumania would be recompensed by the gift of Bessar abia. None of the demands of Bulgaria are denied. Among them is a strip of Serbia. Whether any such informal negotiation has taken place may well be doubted, but if so, it has come about two years too late. There was a time when Bulgaria was on the fence with a leaning toward the entente. The allies, though, lost a golden opportunity by flirt ing with Greece and Rumania. Rumania was supposed to be the dominating military power of the Balkans. Its proximity to Russia on the one side and to Austria on the other made it especially desirable to the allies. The Russian debacle at that time was not forseen. With Rumania joined to the entente there would be In the Balkans a repetition of the result of the second Balkan war. and Turkey would be cut off from the Central PSwers. Such a result, of course, would follow an enlistment of Bulgaria with the entente.. But Bulgaria and Rumania with their clashing inter ests could not be on the same side. Meanwhile the Germans assiduously cultivated Bulgaria, feeling that Rumania would be easily "pock eted" at the proper time. They were also striving for the situation which has been brought about in Russia in which Rumania has ceased to be a factor in the war. It is now plainly seen, of how much greater importance was then the geographical position of Bulgaria, to say nothing of her superior military position over Rumania. When Bulgaria finally cast its lot with the Central I'owers, British newspapers, more far-seeing than the British foreign office, declared that Germany had won a diplomatic victory worth many victories in the field, one whose results would be more far-reaching than those of any or all battles that had yet been fought on land or sea. That has long since been patent to the whole world. With Bulgaria on the side of the entente, and though Rumania were ranged with the Central Powers, Turkey would have been severed from the latter and by this time have been out of the war. Bulgaria would perhaps rather trust the entente than the Central Powers. If Germany should win, whatever territorial aggrandizement might result to Bulgaria, it would still be in Mittel Europa under the shadow of Germany. With the entente victorious, the smaller nations would suffer no interfernce from the allies except such as would assure their protec tion. That consideration standing alone would prob ably influence Bulgaria, but now it cannot stand alone. The progress of the war has isolated it from the allies and would leave it to the mercy of the Germans. Two years ago Bulgaria would have been in touch with the Russians on one side and the Italians on the other. Then was the time for diplomacy. 

WHAT MARY ROBERTS RIN EH ART'S CREED IS Mary Roberts Rinehart says in the October Amer ican Magazine: "For twelve years out of that forty I have been a writer. It is as if, at twenty-eight, I had turned at a right angle to my former path, a path which had seemed as fixed as the sun In its orbit, or the alphabet or a cement pavement, and had begun a journey into a far country. It changed my life somewhat ,it changed me entirely. "The on ething which has, thank God, remained unchanged, has been my family. "In all of my life I have never before sat down and turned my eyes inward. I have never had time to sit by the fire and feel. My life has been purley obpective, my family and my work the family first. It is not easy now to put my philosophy into words. Probably it could be done in two words, love and work. " And that, after all, is th efoundation of every normal life. "Love and work, and to live life to its fullest, and with honor, that seems to me the universal creed. To takeone's self lightly; and one's work seriously, to be a good friend and a poor enemy, to work hard and play hard, to look out and not in, has been the goal I have struggled for. I have failed of course. Is not the very fact that I am Writing this an indication that I am beginning to take myself seriously?" HEADS DAUGHTERS OF CONFEDERACY ggp-p rff V ' 5 J- f SI is Mary Poppenheim. His Mary Poppenheim of Charles Ion, S. C, has been elected president general of the United Danghters at the Confederacy. This organiza tion has authorised the ereation of a general committee for war relief w-ork. Its activities will be under the direction of the American Red Cross. 

PRESIDENT WILSON'S NEWEST SADDLE HORSE IS BELIEVED TO BE HIS BEST - A typpx: i '! im: How shall the poor man, the labor ing man wfio has managed to purchase $50 Liberty Bond, how shall he pro tect his bond? The bonds are navable to bearer. Therefore, a $ni) Liberty Bond in the nouse is just the same as $50 in gold laying about, just like thai much cur rency hidden in the bureau drawer, nd it can be stolen and disposed of ust as easily. The man of wealth who owns manv thousands in Liberty Bonds has placed his bonds along with other valuable papers, in his safety deposit box, and the rent of one for the safe keeping of a i'i0 Liberty Bond would take all the interest the bond draws. It has been suggested by a federal reserve bank official that savings banks who make a specialty of savings deposits should otter to keep the poor man's Liberty Bond for him lust to ncourage the ownr to start a savings deposit there. The United States ranks lowest in the percentage, of savings accounts, and it is thought that if savings banks ept l'ree of charge the pr.or man s bond, many ne-.v .t ings tccounts wouid be started in the country. Another way to protect the bond ru Mers is to have the bonds registered in Washington. By this process the oonus bear the purchaser's name, and one else can receive the interest fiom them miltss the bond is assigned by the purchaser. Interest checks are mailed from Washington. o D The president's new saddle horse, "Democrat" President Wilson does considerable horseback ridinir in cold weather. and is getting to be quite an expert equestrian. Hia latest acquisition, Democrat, it is said will prove to be the best of all the many horses he has ridden since he became president. STOOffif TO SlUb
