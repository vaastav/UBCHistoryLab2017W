(Kuojimtown tifoitrie*. By E. D. STAIR. COOPERSTOWN, GRIGGS CO., DAI. .. PRESIDENTIAL POINTERS President Arthur Favors the People with His Third Annual Message. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. FOREIGN RELATIONS. To the Congress of the United States: At the threshold of your deliberations I congratu late you upon the favorable aspect of the do mestic and foreign affairs of this government. Our relations with other nations continue to be on a friendly footing. With the Argentine Be publio, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Italy, Santo Domingo and Sweden and Norway, no inci dent has occurred which calls for special com ment The recent opening of new lines of telegraphio communication with Central Amer ica and Brazil permitted the interchange of messages of friendship with the gov ernments of those cauntries. Dur ing the year there have been perfected and proclaimed consular and com mercial treaties with Servia and a consular treaty with Boumania, thus extending our in tercourse with the Danubian countries, while our Eastern relations have been placed upon a wider basis by treaties with Corea and Madagascar. The new boundary survey treaties with Mexico, a tradesmark convention and a supplementary extradition treaty with Spain, and a convention extending the duration of the Franco-American claims ommission, have also been proclaimed. Notico of the termination of the fisheries arti cles of the treaty of Washington was duly given Great Britain. The privileges and exemptions of the treaty will seemingly close on July 1, 1885. The fishing industry pursued by a numerous class of our citizens on Northern •oasts, both of the Atlantic and Paoific oceans, •re worthy of the fostering care of congress. Whenever brought tnto competition with like industries in other countries, our fishermen, as well as manufacturers of fishing appliances and preparers of fish products, have main tained a foremost place. I suggest that con gress create a commission to consider the question of our rights in the fish eries, and the means of opening to our citizens, under just and enduring conditions, the richly stocked fishing waters and sealing grounds of British North America. A question has arisen touching the deportation to the United States the British islands, by government or municipal aid, of persons unable there to gain a living and equally a burden on the commun ity here. Such of these persons who come under the pauper class, as defined by the law, have been sent back, according to the provisions of our statutes. Her majesty's government has insisted that precautions have been taken be fore shipment was made. However, they have in eo many cases proven ineffectual, and espe cially so in certain instances of needy unmix: rants reaching our territory through Canada, that a revision of our legislation upon this subject may be deemed advisable. Correspondence relative to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty has been continued, and will be laid before congress. 

AMERICAN POKE. The legislation of France against the impor tation of prepared swine produced from the United States, has been repealed. That result has been due no less to the friendly relation of this government thau to a growing conviction in Fracce that the restriction is not de manded by any real danger to health. Ger many still prohibits the introduction of all swine products from America. I extended to the imperial government a friendly invitation to send experts to the United States to inquire whether the use of these products was danger ous to health. This invitation was declined. I have believed it of such importance, how ever, that tlio exact facta should ascertained and promulgated that I have appointed a com petent commission to make a thorough investi gating of the subject. Its members have shown their public spirit by accenting their trust without pledge of compensation, but I trust that congress will see in the national and international bear ings of the matter sufficient motives for providing at least for the reimbursement of such expenses as they may necessarily iticur. The coronation of the czar at Moscow afforded to the government an occasion for testifying to continued friendship by sending a special envoy and a representative of the navy to at tend the ceremony. While there have arisen during the year no grave questions affecting the status in the Russian empire of American citizens or other faith than that held by the national church, this government remains firm in its convictions that the rights of its citizens abroad should be iu no way affected by their religious belief. It is understood that measures for the removal of the restrictions which now burden our trade with Cuba and Porto ltico are under consider ation by the Spanish government The prox imity of Cuba and the peculiar method of ad ministration which there prevails necessitate constant discussion and appeal on our part from the proceedings of the insular authorities. I regrot to say that just protests of thrn gov ernment have not as yet produced satisfactory results. The commission appointed to decide certain claims of our citizens against the government after tho recognition of sat isfactory rul's as to their validity was admit ted to bo illegal. Full reparation for tho injuries sustained by our citizens should bo no longer delayed and tho farco of naturalization in the United States as a shield to disturbers in other countries abolished. Tho claims com mission has finally adjourned. Soma of its awards, though made more than two years ago, have not yet boon paid. Specie payment is expected. Claims to a large amount which were held by the late commission with out its jurisdiction bavo been presented to the Spanish government, as tho ac tion of the colonial law authorities has given rise to these claims. The case of the Masonic has not yet reached a settlement, Tho Manilla court has found that the proceedings of which this government has complained wore authorized, and it is hoped that the government of Spain will not withhold the speedy reparation which its sense of justice should impel it to offer for tho un usual severity and unjust action of its sub ordinate colonial officers in the case of this vessel. The Helvetian confederation has pro posed the inauguration of a class of interna tal treaties for the deferment to arbitration of grave questions between nationB. of This government has assented to tho proposed inauguration of such already with Switzerland. Under the treaty of Berlin, liberty of con science and civil rights are assured {o all strangers in Bulgaria. As the United States have no distinct conventional relations with that country, and are not a party to the treaty, they should in my opinion maintain diplomatic representation also for the improvement of in- eroourseand the proper protection of the many American citizens who resort to that country as missionaries and teaohers. I sug gest that I be given authority to establish an agency and consulate at the Bulgarian capital. The United States are now participating in a revision of the tariff of the Ottoman Empire. They have assented to the application of a license tax of foreigners doing business in Tur key, but have opposed tho oppressive storage tax upon petroleum entering ports of that country. The government of the khedive has proposed that the authority of the mixed judi cial tribunals in Egypt be extended eo as to cover citizens the United States accused of crime, who are now tried before consular courts. This government is not indisposed to accept the chaugo, but believes that its terms should be' submitted for criticism to the commission appointed to revise the whole subjedt. RELATIONS WITH MEXICO. At no time in our na'ional history has there been more manifest need of close and lasting relations with a neighboring State than now exists with respect to Mexico. The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into that country shows what has already been accomplished by the vast reciprocal advantages which must attend the progress of its internal develop ments. The treaty of commerce and naviga tion of 1848 has been determined by the Mexican government, and in tho absence of convention engagements the rights of our citizens in Mexico now depend upon the domestic statutes of that republic. There have been instances of harsh enforcement of the laws against our ve-sels andicitizens in Mexico, and of denial of diplo matic resort for their protection. The in itial Btep toward a better understading has been taken in the negotiation, by the commis sion authorized by congress, of a treaty which is still before the senate for approval The provisions for the reciprocal defense of the frontier by the troops in pursuit of hos tile Indians have been prolonged for another year. The operations of the forces of both governments against savages have been successful, and several of the most dangerous tribes dispersed by the skill and valor of United States and Mexican soldiers fighting in a common cause. The convention for the resurvey of the boundary from the Bio Grande to the Pacific having been ratified and exchanged, the preliminary reconnois sance therein stipulated has been effected. It now rests with congress to make provision for completing the survey and resetting the boun dary monuments. A convention was signed with Mexico on July 13, 1882, providing for the rehearing of the case of Benjamin Weu vs. The Abra Sylon Mining Company, in whoBe favor awards were made by the late Amerioan and Mexican claims commission, That con vention still awaits the action of the senate. Meanwhile, because of the charges of fraudu lent awards which have made a new commis sion necessary, the executive has directed the suspension of pay of the distribution quota re ceived from Mexico. OWE CENTRAL AMERICAN NEIGHBORS. Our geographical proximity to Central Amer ica, and our political and commercial relations with the seat of that country, justify, in my judgment, such material increase of consular corpB as will placo at each capital a consul general. The contest between Bolivia, Chili and Peru have passed from the stage of strategio hostilities to that of negotia tion, in which the consuls of this government have beeu exercised. The demands of Chili for absolute cession of territory have been maintained and accepted by tho party of Gen. Iglesias to the extent of concluding a treaty of peace with the government of Chili, in general conformity with the terms of the pro tocol signed in May last between the Chilian com maud ry and Gen. Iglesias. As a result of the conclusion of this treaty Gen. Iglesias has been formally recognizod by Chili as president of Peru, and his government installed at Lima, which has been evacuated by the Chilians. A call has boon issued by Gen. Iglesias for a rep resentative assembly to be electud on tho 13tli of January, and to meet at Linu on the 1st of March next. Meanwhile the provisional gov ernment of Gen. Iglesias has applied for rec ognition to the principal powers of America and Europe. When the will of tho Peruvian people shall be manifested 1 shall not hesitate to recognize the diplomatic and representatives approved by thein. Represen tatives of this government attended at Caracas the centennial celebration of tho birth of the illustrious Bolivar. At tho same time tho unveiling of a statue of Washington in tho Venezuelan capital testified to the veneration in which his memory is held there. Congress at its last session authorized tho execu:ivo to pro pose to the Venezuelan government a reopening of tho awards of the mixed commission Of Car acas, and the departure from this country of the Venezuelan minister has delayed tho open ing of negotiations for reviving the commis sion. This government holds that, until the re-establisliment of a treaty oa this subject, the Venezuelan government must continue to make these payments provided for in the convention of 1806. There is ground for be lief that the dispute growing out of the un paid obligations due from Veneznela to France will be satisfactorily adjusted. The French oabinet has proposed a basis of settlement which meets my approval, but as it involves a recasting of the aunual quotas of the foreign debt it has been deemed advisable to submit tho proposal to the judgements of tho cabirieta of Berlin, Copenhagen, the Hague, London and Madrid. THB 

SANDWICH ISLANDS. At the recent coronation of hia maiesty King Kalakaua this government was repre sented diplomatically and by the formal visit'of a vessel of war. Tho question of terminating or modifying the existing reciprocity treaty with Hawaii is now before congress. I am con vinced that the charges of abuse and frauds under that treaty have been exaggerated, and I renew the suggestions of last year's mes iage, that the treaty bo modified wherever its pro visions have proved onerous to legitimate trade. I am not disposed to favor tho entire cessation of treaty relations which have fos tered good will between tho countries, and contributed toward the equality of Hawaiian among the nations. QOOD WILL IN THE ORIENT. In pursuance of tho ohcy declared by this government of extending our inter course with the Eastern nations, legations have during the past year been established in Per sia, Si Kin and Corea. It is probable that per­ manent missions from those countries will ore long be maintained in the United States. A special emba-sy from Siam is now on its way hither. Treaty relations w.th Corea wore per fected by tho exchange at Simul on the 19th of Way last of tlje ratification of the lately con eluded convention, and envoys from the king of Zanzibar bavo visited this cmintry and receivod a cordial wcl .'ine. Corea. as yet unacquainted with the methods of Western civilization now in ches tho attentiou of those in er sted in tho foreign trade, as it needs the implements and I products which the United Stat,-a are ready to supply. Wo seel no monopoly of its com merce and no advantage over other nations, but as the Chinese in reaching for a higher £vi!izat:un have confided iu this republic, wo cunnot regard with ind.lTert.nce any eneioach ments on their rit'h's. CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES. China, by the payment of a money indemni ty, has settled etr.ain of the long-pending olaims of our citizens, and I havo strong hopes that the remainder win soon be adjusted. Questions have arisen touching the rights of American and other foreign manufacturers in China, under tho provisions of treaties wliioli permit aliens to exeroiso their industries in that country. Ou this specific point our own treaty is silent But under the operation of the mo favored na ions clause we have like privileges to tboie of other powers. Whiio it is the duty of tho government to seo that our citizens nave the full enjoyment of every benefit secured by treaty, I doubt the expediency of lead ing in a movement to constrain China to admit an interpretation by which we have only an indirect right to exact the transference to China of American capital. For tho employment there of Chinese labor would in effect inaugurate a competition for tho control of markets now supplied by our homo industries. There is good reason to be lieve that the law restricting the immigra tion of Chinese has been violated intentionally or otherwise by the officials of Chiua upon whom is devolved tho duty of certifying that the emigrants belong to tho excepted classes. Measures havo been taken to ascertain the facts incident to this supposed infraction and it is believed that the government of China will co-operate with the United States in securing the faithful observatioo of the law. The same considerations which prompted con gress at its last session to return to Japan the Simoneski indemnity seem to me to require at its hands like action in respect to the Can ton indemnity fund, now amounting to $300, 000. The question of the general revision of the foreign treaties of Japan has been consid ered in an international conference held at Tokio, but without definite result as yet This government is disposed to concede the requests of Japan to determine its own tariff duties, pro vide such proper judicial tribunals as may commend themselves to the Western powers for the trial of causes to which foreigners are parties, and to assimilate the terms and decla rations of its treaties to those of other civilized States. Through our ministers at London and Monrovia, this government has endeavored to aid Liberia in its differences with Great Britain, touching the boundaries of that republic. There as a prospect of the adjustment of the dispute by the adoption of the Mannah river as the line. This arrangement is a compromise of the con flicting territorial claims. Tho rich and populous valley of the Congo is being opened to commerce by a society called the International African asso ciation, of which the king of the Belgians is president, and a citizen of the United States chief executive officer, and large tracts of territory havo been ceded to the association by native chiefs. Tho objects of this association are philanthropic. It does not aim at perma nent political control, but seeks the neutrality of the valieys which have been opened. Steamboats placed oil the river and tho nuclei of states established it twenty-two stations under one flag, which offers freedom to commerce and prohibts the slave trade. The United States cannot be indifferent to this work, nor to the interests of their citizens involved in it. It may become advisable for us to co-operate with other com mercial powers in promoting the rights of rade and residence in the Congo valley free rom the influence or political control of any one nation. In view of the frequency of invi tations from foreign governments to partici pate in social and scientic congresses for the discussion of important matters of general concern, I repeat the suggestion of my last message, that provision be made for the exercise of discretionary power by the executive in appointing delegates to ?uch conventions. Specialists are ready to servo the national interest iu such capacity, without persoual profit or other compensation thau the defrayment of expenses actually incurred, and this a comparatively small animal appropna tion woul.i suffice to meet 

RESTRICTIONS WON TRADE. 1 have alluded in my previous nicssago to the injurious and vexatious restrictions snf fered bv our trade in the Spanish West Indies. Brazil, whoso natural outlet for its great national trade in coffee is in and through tho United States, imposes a heavy export duty upon teat product. A like narrow pulicy is pursued iu other Ameri can countries. Our petroleum exports are hampered in Turkey and iu other Eastern ports by restrictions as to storage, and by onerou-Ttaxatioti. The free outward movemout of our great food product is in some quarters clogged with like impediments. For tlieso mis chiefs adequate relief is not always provided by recipracity treaties like that with Hawaii or that lately negotiated with Mexico, and now awaiting tho action of t!ie senate. It is advisable to provide some measure of equilable relation with the governments which discriminate against our own. If, for example, the execu tive were empowered to app to Spani-h ves 3ols from Cuba and Porta itico tho"same rules of treatment and scales of prices for technical faults which are applied to our vessels and cargoes in the Antilles, a resort to that course might not be barren of good results. A dis cretionary author.ty to forbid the importation of articles of consumption injurious to health might be advantageously exercised in our deal ing with countries that discriminate against our food products. WAR AND THE NAVY. THE INDIANS MOSTLY QUIET. From the report of the secretary of war it will be seen that in only a single instance lias there been any disturbance of the quiet condi tion of our Indian tribes. A raid was made from Mexico iuto Arizona by a small party of Indians, which was pursued by Gen. Crook into the mountaiuous regions from which it had come. It is confidently hoped that serious outbreaks will not again occur, and that the Indian tribes which have for mauy years dis turbed the West will hereafter remain in peaceable submission. STATE MILITIA ENCOUBAGED. On several occasions during the past year officers of tho army have, at the request of State authorities, visited these military en campments for inspection of troops From the reports of those officers I am induced to believe that the oucouragemeut of the Stato militia organization by tho National govern ment would be followed by very gratifying re sults and would afford it, in sudden emer gencies, the aid of a largo body of volunteers educated in tho performance of military du ties. AN EXPOSED SEACOAST. I again call your attention to the present condition of our extended seacoast, upon which are so many largo cities whose wealth and im portance to tho country would, iu time of war, invite attack from mod ern armored ships, against wbicli our existing defensive works could give no ade quate protection. Those works were built be fore the introduction of modern heavy rilled guns in'o maritiins warfar and if tliuy are not put in an efficient condition, wo may easily I bo subjected to humiliation by a hostile power groatly inferior to ourselves." As germane to this subject. I call your attention to tho im portance of pert cting our submarine torpedo defences. Tho board authorized by tho last con gress io report on the methods for tho manufacture of heavy ordnance, and adapted to modern warfare, has vis ited tho principal iron and steel works in this country and in Europe. It is hoped that its report wiil be soon made, and that congress will thereupon be disposed to provide suitable facilities and plans for tho manufacture of such guns as are now imperatively needed. The secretary of tlio navy reports that, uudor the authority of tho acts of Aug. 5, 1882, and March 3, 1883, tho work of strengthening our 1.avy by the construction of modern vessels has been auspiciously begun. Three cruisers are in progress of construction—the Chicago, of I 4.500 tons displacement, and the Boston and 1 Atlantic, each ot i,OUO tons. xney are to be built of steel, with the teuBile strength and ductility prescribed by law, and in combination of speed, endurance, and armament are ex pected to compare favorably with tne best un armed war vessels of other nations. A fourth vessel, the Dolphin, to be constructed of similar matorials, is inteuded to serve as a fleet dispatch boat. The double-turreted monitors Puritan, Amphi trite and Terror have been launched on 'the Delaware river, and a contract has boen made for the supply of their machinery. A similar vessel, the Monadnock, has been launched in California. The naval advisory board and the secretary recommend the completion of the monitors, the construction of four gunboats, and also of three steel vessels like the Chicago, Boston and Dolphiu, as an important measure of material defense. 

INTERIOR WATERWAYS. The secretary urges ttio immediate creation of an interior fast line of water ways across the peninsula of Florida, along the coast from Florida to Hampton lioads, between tho Ch"unpenko i)»v and Del.warn river, and through Cape Cod. I feel bound to impress upon the attention of congress tho necessity of continued progress in the construction of the natgr. The condition of the publio treasury, as I havo already intimated, makes the pres ent an auspicious time for putting this branch of the service in a state of efficiency. It is no part of our policy to create and "maintain a navy able to cope with that of the other great powers of the world. We havo 110 wish for foreign conquest, and the peace which we have eo long enjoyed is in no seeming danger of interruption yet our naval strength should be made adequata for the de fense of our harbors, the protection of onr commercial interests, and the maintenance of our national houor—a proposition from which no patriotic citizen can withhold his assent TitE TREASURY. A GRATIFYING EXHIBIT. The report of the secretary of the treasury gives a full and interesting exhibit of the financial condition of the country. It shows that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1883, atnouuted to $398,287,581.05, whereof there was re ceived from customs, $214,706,490.03 from internal revenue, $144.720,308.95 tromsale of public lands. $7,955,804.42 from tax on circulation and deposits of national banks, $9,111,008.85 from• profits on coinage of bullion deposits and assays, $4,460,205.17 from other sources, $17,333,637.60.

Hitherto tho surplus, as rapid ly as it has accumulated, has been devoted to the reduction of the national debt. As a result, tho jnly bonds now outstanding which are re deemable at tlia pbasuro of tho government are the 3 per cents, amounting to $305,000,000: 

POSTOFV1CE AFFA1KS. A h/i 4*2 por cents, amounting to ^"Joo.uuo.uutfc and tho $737,000,000 4 per cents are not payable until 1801 and 1907 respectively. If tho surplus shall hereafter be as large as the1 treasury estimates now indicate, the 3 per cent: bonds may all be redeemed at least four years before any of the 4*2 per cents can be called' in. The latter at the same rate of accumula tion of surplus oan be paid at matur ity, and the moneys requisite for the redemption of the 4 per cents will be in the treasury long before tbeBe obligations become payable. There are cogent reason^ however, why the national indebtedness shoul4 not be thus rapidly extinguished. Chief among them is the fact that only by excessive taxation is such rapidity attainable. REDUCING THE REVENUE. In a communication to congress at its last session I recommended that all excise be abol ished except those relating to distilled spirits, and that a substantial reduction also be mado in the revenues from customs. A statute haB since been enacted by which the annual tax aud tariff receipts of the government have been cut down to the exteut' of at least fifty or sixty millions of dollars. While! bavo no doubt that still further reduc tions may be wisely made, I do not advise the adoption at this session of any measures for a largo diminution of the national reyeuues. The results of the legislation of last session of congress have not as yet become sufficiently: apparent to iu-tify any radical revision 'j: sweeping modifications of existing law. Iu the interval which must elapse before the effects of the act of March 3, 1883, can bo definitely ascertained, a portion, at least, of this surplus revenues may be wisely applied to the long neglected duty of rehabilitating our navy and Earbors. rovidiug defenses for the protection of our This is a matter to which I shall again advert. Immediately associated with the financial subjects just discussed is the import ant question, What legislation is needed' re garding the national currency? The aggregate amount of bonds now on deposit iu tho treas ury to support the national bank circulation is about $350,000,000 nearly $200,000,000 of this amount consists of 3 per cents, which, as already stated, are payable at the pleasure of the government, and are likely to be called in within less than four years, unless meantime the surplus revenues shall bo di minished. The probable effeot of such an extensive retirement of the securities wbici are the basis of the national bank circulation would be such a contraction of the volume of the currency as to produce grave commercial embarrassment. How can the danger be obvi ated? The most effectual plan, and one whose adoption at the earliest practical opportunity I shall heartily approve, has already been indicated. If the reve nues of the next four years 6hall kept substantially commensurate witb the ex penses, the volume of circulation will not be. likely to suffer any material disturbance but if, on the other hand, there shall be great delay in reducing taxation, it will become necessary either to substitute some other form of currency in place of the national bank notes, or to make important changes in the laws by which their circulation is now controlled. In my judgment the latter course is far preferable. I commend to your attention the very interesting and thoughtful suggestions on this subject which appear in the secretary's report. The objections which he urges againBt the acceptance of any other securities than the obligations of tho govern ment itself as a foundation for national bank circulation seem to me insuperable. For ad verting the threatened contraction, two courses have been suggested, either of which is prob ably feasible. One is the issuance of now bonds, having mauy years to run, bearing a low rate of interest and exchangeable upon specified terms for those now outstanding. The other course, which commends itself to my own judgment as tho better, is the enactment of a law repealing the tax on circulation and permitting banks to issue notes for an amount equal to 90 per cent of tho mar ket value, instead of, as now, tho face value of deposited bonds. I agree with tho secretary in tho belief that the adoption of this plan wi-ll afford the necessary relief. THE MADE BOLTJAK. Tho trade dollar was coined for the purposes of trade in countries where silver passed at its value, ascertained by its weight and fiuness. It never had a legal tender quality. Large numbers of theso coins entered, how ever, into the volume of our currency by common consent Their circulation in domestic trade has now ceased, aud they have become a disturbing element. They should not longer be permitted to embarrass our cur rency system. I recommend that provision for their rocoption by tho treasury and mints as bullion at a small percentage above the cur rent market prices of silver of like liueuess. CUSTOMS DISTRICTS. The secretary of the treasury advises a com bination of certain of tho customs districts of the cou: try, and suggests thai the presideut be vested with such power in relation thereto as is now given liim in respect to collec tors of internal revenue by Hoc. 3131 of too roviscd statutes. The, statistics ou this subject, which are contained iu his report, furnish of themselves a strong argument in defense of his views. A( the adjournment of congress tho number of internal revenue collection districts was 120. By executive orders dated June 2-5, 1883, I directed that certain of these districts be con solidated. The result has. heen a reduction of one-third their number, which at present is but eighty-tfcree.
