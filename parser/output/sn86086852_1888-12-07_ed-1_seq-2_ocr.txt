Friday, December 7, 1888. “ He mocks the people who proposes that the government shall protect the rich, and that they in turn w ill care for the laboring poor.” President Cleve land. We venture to call the attention of the republicans who, while believing in tariff reform, voted for Gen. Harrison, in the serene confidence that if elected he would kick over the platform on which he was nominated, to the signs of appetite which their party is show ing in regard to the surplus. From every quarter of the land there are un mistakable indications that the clamor to spend all the surplus in one way or another is going to be tremendous. If the tariff reform republicans are to get any hearing for their views they must be up and doing without delay. There are, we believe, many thousands of them who are convinced, not only that the burden of tariff taxation should le reduced, but that the great est danger which threatens the con tinued supremacy of their party is its tendency to go to the extremes which its high-protection element is pushing it. If this element carries the day, there will be nothing left for tariff reform republicans to do but to swallow their convictions or to turn mugwumps. It is in order to spare them from the horrors of the latter fate that wo give them this warning. The present race of mugwumps ac cording to unanimous and oft-repeated republican authority, is completely extinct. Think what a responsibility would rest upon the party if within a year or two it should cause the birth of anew race of them! The New York Evening Post. The Democrat knows of many re publicans who, while admitting that the tariff taxes ought to be reduced voted for Harrison and Morton and their party candidate for congress, con soling themselves with the thought that, “ under the present condition of tlie finances, the tariff will be lowered, no matter which party is successful.” They were loath to avow themselves supporters of the doctrine of protection as expounded by McKinley, Kelley, and other high taxers; but would not go the length of giving force and effect to their convictions by voting the dem ocratic ticket. By their votes they have virtually said, we favor the reduction of the surplus by extrava gant appropriation, or by the entire repeal of internal taxes, rather than by surrendering any part of our protec tive system. Now, if that is not their position upon the great question of federal taxation, they should lose no time in informing their representative m congress of the fact. If, while they would not support a democratic policy of tariff reform, they would like tariff reform, provided it came from a repub lican source, they should at once speak out and let themselves lie understood. HU. 

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. President Cleveland’s last annual message, delivered to congress on Monday, is published in full in this is sue of The Democrat. Like his mem orable document of one year ago, it is a bold, outspoken and sound slate paper. Tlje language is pointed and dear; and notwithstanding the fact that congress is not likely to act upon them, the recommendations made arc eminently wise and proper. Below will be found a number of press com ments upon the message: New York Times, Ind. The pres- j blent Inis somewhat overstated the ease, tmt the message contains an amount of undeniable truth to which the country will he compelled to give attention. New York World, Dem. The mes sage is a dignified, clear, compact and forcible state paper. If issued three years ago and followed in 1886 by last year's tariff message, not even the power of money nor the personal dis affection in the party could have pre vented democratic success this year. New York Press, Uep. It i> the ef fort of a shallow demagogue to create ill-feeling between classes. New York Tribune.—lt is an at-j tempt to stir up anarchy by pandering! to ignorance and passion. New York Herald, Ind. Mr. Cleve land’s remarks are sensible and well j put, but his is the voice of one crying | in the wilderness. The people have ; elected a party which favors monop- ! olistic combinations and they do not care enough about the evil effects of ! the system to change it. Chicago Tribune. Hep. Cleveland is bold, nervy, and desires at lea>t one more round before he will acknowledge himself whipped. And if four years hence the democrats want a bold and aggressive leader for a free-trade cru sade where can they find a better man than (trover Cleveland? Washington star, lad.—President Cleveland's last annual message is in tone refreshingly direct and vigorous. N\> suggestion of a compromise is to be found in the discussion of a lost cause lost for a time at least—of a tariff for revenue only. The language employed is pointed rather than smoothly diplomatic. Boston Herald, Ind. The message has. in consideration of controverted questions, the qualities of frankness and courage, which have distin guished President Cleveland's entire public life, and it will be found to be throughout a statesmanlike as well as a patriotic document. Only a (Question of Time. The lacrosse Chronicle. Mr. Cleveland, inspired by the cour age of his convictions, joined issue with the powers of greed and it is only a question of time whea the people with a full realizing sense of their present mistake, will vindicate the policy of president Cleveland at the polls, and taxation will be reduced to a just and equitable standard: a con dition of things that will never to pass under a republican administra tion. An exchange says that it has leaked out that the visit of President Miller, of the St. Paul road, to London, is in reference to a proposed long-time con tract for a close alliance with the Union Pacific and St. Paul. All of the big Western roads have recently extended their lines to the Rockv Mountains or beyond, and have in most instances secured Pacific coast connections. The Burlington, the Rock Island, the Northwestern, the Missouri Pacific and the Manitoba roads have crossed the plains withia the past few years, and the St. Paul road alone is bottled up at the Mis souri river. It is now proposed to form an alliance amounting to a practical consolidation with the Union Pacific. Through trains will be run from Chi cago to the Pacific coast over the Union Pacific and via the Oregon Short Line. The traffic will be turned over to the St. Paul road at the Mis souri river. The proposed alliance will be for ninety-nine years. There is a great deal of truth in the following plain and vigorous words from the Chicago Tribune; “The eastern news correspondents have let up on Mrs. I>angtry, her clothes, and her divorce suits only to fill the wires with a lot <tf stuff about Sullivan, Mitchell,- Dempsy and other drunken, disreputable, would be prize lighters. Their everlasting challenges and their pretences that they are trying to get up what they call a ‘square’ fight have become tiresome. There is not one of them but would sell out the moment he got a chance. The ‘square’ pugilist is a repulsive creature and his trade is a bloody and disgusting one, but when men like Sayers and Heenan come together and fight it out, we have some measure of respect for them. But their breed is extinct, anil those who call themselves their successors are bloaten whisky soaks—bullies and cheats. Their intention is not to hurt one another, but to have a hippodrome i —a sham fight—and sell tickets to fools at fancy prices. All they are fit for is to break stone. What they say and do is of no more interest than the sayings and doings of an equal number of toughs down on the levee. Such news may be of interest down east, but it has ceased to be so here. An account of a prize fight people will still read, but it must be fought by ruffians who at least have the virtue of sincerity.” The above denunciation applies with equ il force to the professional wrestlers, who, as a rule, are as great frauds as professional pugilists can be. They both live upon the notoriety giv en them by newspapers foolish enough to publish their challenges and boast ings.

Hugh Jones, lately of Washington Territory, is visiting his brother W. H. Jones of this village. Thanksgiving day was appropriately observed in Arena. Union services were held at 10:30 a. m. in the Congre gational church, addressed by the Adventist minister, Byron Meigs. The Congregational minister, John Willan, was to have led a conference meeting at the close of the sermon, but being afflicted with quinsy he was unable to attend; so that duty also; devolved upon Mr. Meigs. The sermon was throughtful and good and the conference meeting well conducted —receiving ready responses. The ser vices were heartily enjoyed by a large audience. The W. C. T. U. served an oyster supper in their rooms over the Prohi bition Hall, for which they received about 119.00. After supper a large audience gathered in the hall and were addressed by M. D. Peavy, S. H. Schellenger, Thomas Thomas, and Byron Meigs on topics in keeping with our great national Thanksgiving day. The exercises were interspersed with appropriate music well rendered by the Arena male and female quartettes. Heartfelt thanks were again and again expressed for the varied and abundant mercies and blessings bestowed upon us, nationally and individually, by the loving heavenly Father. The angel of Death turned Thanks giving day into a day of mourning for the family of John Popis by calling hence one member, Fred, a boy of eighteen, an invalid and perhaps the most cherished of all. His funeral took place on Saturday from the Conge grational church of this village, the sermon being preached by Dr. Wrn. Stoddard of Black Earth. Dr. Stoddard occupied the Congre gaitonal pulpit at “Arena Third,” in the afternoon, and at Arena again in the evening. John Willan, the Congre gational minister of this piace, was to have occupied Dr. Stoddard’s pulpit in Black Earth, but as he had not suf ficiently recovered from quinsy to be able to go, he sent S. 11. Schellenger in his place. At this writing Mr. Willan is much better. The school board have caused the teachers to smile and be glad by erect ing a substantial and commodious wood-shed and piling in a good supply of dry oak wood, before the winter sets in. Let other boards do likewise. Rev. Mr. Willan and the M. E. minister of Mill Creek are soon to begin union gospel meetings at “ Arena Second.” The union sentiment is rapidly growing among Christians, and so it ought. Let honest, deep con viction of truth stir us up to a fervent zeal for the Master’s cause and withal lot us abound in charity, to the end that we make work together in harmony for the conversion of the world to Christ. s. n. s.

JEsW ettine °nly for little chil fe- .? dren should look over the "prospectus of that maga 'I & T r, 2ine for ISB9, and they will discover that it is for children of all ages, “from five to eighty-five,” as someone recently said of it. Indeed, while St. Kicholae is designed for girls and boys, it might almost be called a "family magazine,” for the grown-up members of a household will find much to interest them in every number. The editor, Mrs. Mary Mape-s Dodge, calls the next volume an “all-round-the world year,” because it is to contain so many illustrated papers about the world in general—not dry geographical papers, but stories and sketches and tales of travel and adventure by land and sea—and all illus trated by the best artists. The features will include a serial story, “How We Made the Farthest North,” by /~>n, Gen. A. W. Greely, the well-known commander AdlF'Jyf the Greely Expedition; serial about Canada, by Mrs. VP V j 7 J Catherwood, who is writing 'v^ a serial story for The Century this year; “Indians of the Amazon,” by Mrs. Frank R. Stockton. There are many papers about Europe, including a Christmas story of life in Norway, by H. H. Boyesen; articles on Holland and the Dutch, by Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge: “The Queen s Navy,” by Lieut. F. Harrison Smith, R. N.. with illustrations of many of England’s finest war ships ; “The Winchester School,” illustrated by Joseph Pennell; “English Railway Trains,” by Wm. H.

VHE question has often been asked, “to what does The Century owe its great circu lation!” I7k Christian Cnion once answered this by the statement that “it has been fairly won, not by adver tising schemes, but by the excellence which characterizes it in every department,” In their announcements for the coming year the publishers state that it has always been their desire to make The Century the one in dispensable periodical of its class, so that whatever other publication might be desira ble in the family. The century could not be neglected by those who wish to keep abreast of the times in all matters pertaining to culture. And the unprecedented circula tion of the magazine would seem to be the response of the public to this intention. With the November nurn oer The Century begins its thirty-seventh volume. Two great feat ures of the magazine which are to continue throughout the new vol- ef'lf CZjT K A ume are already well A known to the public, the 1 Lincoln history and the I papers on “Siberia and KtVSi V?Si the Exile System.” Tht first of these, written by IT Messrs.

The Chi cago Tribune says that “no other magazine articles printed in the English language just aow touch upon a subject which so vitally interests all thoughtful people in Europe and America and Asia.” As is already known, copies of The Century entering Russia have these articles torn out by the customs officials on the frontier. during ISS9 The Century will publish the most im portant art feature that has yet found . |\ place in its pages. It is the 5\ A result of four years’ work \ —of Mr. Timothy Cole, the leading magazine engraver lbo * n tbe Kailenes lilfL of Europe, engraving from \\TV jay the originals the greatest of pictures by the old masters. Z'* A series of papers on Ire laud, its customs, land scapes, etc., will appear, and there are to be illustrated articles on Bible scenes, treating especially the subjects of the Inter national Sunday-School Lessons. George W.
