VOLUME LXXIX.-NO. 2. MESSAGE OF GROVER. Will Reiterate His Views on Finances and the Tariff. NO REVENUE INCREASE. Conditions in Cuba Do Not War rant the Recognition of Insur gents as Belligerents. DAMAGES TO SEALERS URGED. The Panama Canal, the Alaskan and Venezuelan Boundaries Slightly Touched Upon. WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 1.-Presi dent Cleveland's annual message to Con gress, which will be read Tuesday, is to con tain 15,000 words and will till about eight average newspaper columns. In manu script it covered about seventy-live type written pages of legal-sized paper. The message has been set up at ttie Govern ment printing office. Each printer was given a very small "take." so that no one compositor has any knowledge of the treatment of any one subject. The forms after printing were pied by the foreman, who had extra guards sta tioned in the pressroom to see that no copies got away. The completed trims are safely under lock and key. These pre cautions are always taken to prevent en terprising newspaper* from securing the document by either fair or foul means. It was reported to-day that one ambitious journalist had instructed his correspond ent to pay ?5000 for the message, if it could be purchased for money. The mes vas read to the Cabinet last Thurs day. !t is believed that President Cleveland v.ill reiterate hi£ former well-known views and recommendations »s to the tariff and ihiance*. and declare the tariff bill of the last Congress to be a good beginning and will ask a further revision of the tariff BChednle. He will insist that it will fur nish revenue sufficient under normal busi ness conditions and endeavor to show a gradual increase in revenue derived from import duties. It is considered doubtful whether he will recommend any addi tional internal revenue tax. It was reported some time ago that Secretary Carlisle was endeavoring fo impress upon Mr. Cleveland the advisabiiity of recora- Diemhng to Congress the imposition of a tax on domestic wines or upon beer and patent medicines. Prominent Senators and Representatives with whom The Call correspondent talked to-night consider it improbable that he wilJ recommend any jncrea-e of inter nal revenue taxation at this time. Senator Perkins (who arrived to-night). Grove L. Johnson, Representative Loud and others from California expressed this belief, but declared that if he did so all that is left of the Democratic party in California would be completely annihilated. "Nothing more disastrous could happen to our already suffering business," said Senator Perkins. "The wine men already have enough to contend with." It is also the general impression that no tax on beer, the "poor man's drink," will be advised. Politicians have told Mr. Cleveland that the recommendation of f 1 per barrel upon beer would be disastrous to any prospects the Democratic party may have in the next Presidential election. It is almost a foregone conclusion that he will recommend the retirement of greenbacks by the issue of low-rate Donds. It is believed he will assert that con ditions in Cuba do not warrant recognition by Congress of belligerency of the in surgents, and will contend that there is no precedent for such recognition. President Cleveland, in touching upon the Venezuelan boundary matter, will endeavor to show that the administration has done everything possible to uphold the Monroe doctrine. He will allude to correspondence that has passed between the United States and Great Britain on this subject, and will embody in his mes sage Secretary Olney's last high-sounding note to Embassador Bayard, and the British Government's reply. He will urge the payment of claims against the United States preferred by Canadian sealers for the seizure of vessels, for which damages were awarded the Canadians by the Paris tribunal. He will ask Congress to provide for a commission to act with the representatives of Great Britain and the Dominion of Canada to nettle these claims and, after the awards are made, pay them. The Walier incident will be mentioned, and again he will asseverate that the State Department's policy has been firm and dignified. Pacific Coast Congressmen, including • Senator Squire, believe that in touching upon N:caragua Canal affairs lie will quote the report of the Nicaragua Canal Com mission which lias been lately submitted to him; and as this report is believed to declare that the present canal could not be completed short of $130,000,000, he will temporize by recommending that further investigation be made before work of such magnitude is undertaken. It is not known whether he alludes to the Alaskan boundary question, but if so, he will merely say that the computations ; lt( "i on field surveys are no\r bein;,' ■! out by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and when the boundary line is once well defined and marked due notice result wi.l be given G rent Britain, that meanwhile American patrols protect the interests of American in that region. If i" a ludea to Pacific railroad matters, ie wii probably make no positive reconi ' ■ >ut will merely advise that ction uc taken speedily, in view of 1 maturity of the bonds. 11 is not believed that President Clere ; i-;ive any tii in ■• to Bftj about Ha n affair.- beyond a mere platitudinoci •n that our relations with tb* Hawaiian republic are "pleasant." That he will ignore the question of annexation is believed by Senators Perkins, Squire, Uilson of Washington and other prom* The San Francisco Call. A 

"CALL" ARTIST'S IMPRESSIONS AT THE PAVILION YESTERDAY. SOME WELL-KNOWN THOROUGHBREDS. inent Pacific Coast men with whom The Call correspondent conversed to-night. MUST RKCOGXiZE CUBA\S. Congressmen Who Favor the Fight of Patriots for Freedom. WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. L-Robert R. Hitt of Illinois, one of the ablest and best posted men who have ever dealt with foreign affairs in Congress, and who will be chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com mittee in the next House, is firmly of the belief that one of the first acts of Congress should be the passage of a resolution rec ognizing the Cuban insurgents as belli gerents. Mr. Hitt is a thorough American, and is disgusted with the contemptibly weak, impotent, vacillating policy of the present administration. Mr. Hitt will also have a resolution introduced from his committee scoring the administration for its Ha waiian policy. Mr. Hitt says he is not prepared to say yet whether he will intro duce a bill for the annexation of the Ha waiian Islands, but an intimate friend of his said that it would be one of the first things to demand Hitt's attention. Lemuel Ely Quigg, a member of Con gress and editor of the New York Press, said to The Call correspondent to-night: "I certainly will gupport any resolution which recognizes Cubans as belligerents, and I believe that such a resolution would be passed through both houses with a hur rah that would make Grover dizzy." Grove 1». Johnson, the able and intrepid Congressman from California, says that members of Congress, except a few cuckoos who still remain in the House, will, with out respect to party, support a resolution recognizing the belligerency of the insur gents. Indeed this seems to be the opinion of a score of prominent men with whom The Call correspondent conversed to night. 

POPULISTS ARE UX IT ED. Favor a Protectorate Over Ifateaii and Recognition of Cubans. WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. I.— Peffer says that the Populists of the Senate will hold a meetine to-morrow to outline their policy. They will not decide upon their programme as to finance until they see what the Republicans will do. Peffer says he would rather have a protectorate over Hawaii than annexation of the islands, but all the Populists will vote for the rec ognition of Cubans as belligerents. "The Populists will vote as a unit on all propositions," said he. TOO EXPERT WITH A PEN Arrest of the Secretary and Manager of an Abstract Company. By a Series of Forged Instruments J. E. Alpaugh Secured a Large Sum. PERRY, lowa, Dec. I.— Some extensive forgeries were uncovered here to-day, and as a result J. E. Alpaugh, secretary and manager of the Dallas County Abstract Company, is under arrest, charged with the crime. He was arrested at the in stance of Cashier Haas of the Scott County Savings Bank at Davenport. Alpaugh has made loans for this bank for the past eighteen months aggregating about $40,000. Of this amount about $13,000 has been secured upon forged in struments. His plan was to select some farmer in good circumstances and execute a mortgage upon his farm by forging the names. These instruments were sent to the bank at Davenport and a draft payable to the mortgagor was forwarded to Alpaugh, who again forged the name and obtained the money. These instruments were not put on record, but the Recorder's certifi cate was forged upon them. Alpaugh, being an expert abstractor and penman, accomplished the task with ap parent ease. He was arrested on four charges of forging and uttering forged in struments on John J. Moore for $2300, D. Wesley $1800 and W. F. INash $1400. He waived examination and his bond was placed at $2500 on each charge, or $10,000 on all, in default of which he was taken to the County Jail. _ READY TO JSVAItK EQUAItOR. Revolutionist s Determined to Overthrow thr Alfnro Government. PANAMA, Colombia, Dec. I.— The Star and Herald says: A number of Ecuador ian emigrants at Pasto have.pubricly or ganized an army to invade Ecuador for the purpose of overthrowing the recently established Government of President Al faro. The revolutionists are within sight of the garrisoned towns of Tulcan and Ibarra and an attack is expected hourly. SAN 

FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 2, 1895. READY FOR BUSINESS. The Fifty-Fourth Congress Will Convene at Noon. OATH OF OFFICE FIRST. ■ Then Will Come the Preliminary Organization and Appoint*. ment of Committees. TO WAIT ON THE PRESIDENT. Cleveland's Message Is Expected on Tuesday and May Be Read That Afternoon. WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 1.-The Fifty-fourth Congress will convene to morrow at 12 o'clock, according to law, in first regular session. In the Senate the twenty-nine members whose terms begin with this Congress, to whose admission no objection is made, will be sworn in. The list includes sixteen new members of the body. The credentials of Mr. Dupont, who claims a seat from Delaware to suc ceed Mr. Higgins, will, according to pres ent arrangements, be referred to the Com mittee on Privileges and Election?, and pending investigation and report he will not be seated. The oath of office having been admin istered to the newly elected rrlernbers noti fication will be sent to the House that the I Senate is organized and ready for business j and prepared to join the House in the ap pointment of a committee to wait upon the President to notify him of the as sembling and organization of Congress ready to receive any communication he may have to make. This notification will probably be made to President Cleveland j on Tuesday and his annual message will be read that afternoon. After the adjournment of the Senate a caucus of Republican members will be j held. It is given out to-night that no decisive action will be determined upon. The meeting is more for the purpose of a general conference, it being the first op portunity for Senators to get together after nine months' recess. A nomination for President of the Senate pro tern. may be aereed upon and committee vacancies will be discussed. The elective officers will also be considered, but no action on these matters is expected for several days at least. In the meantime, however, there will be the rearrangement of committees and the matter of distributing the appropriation bills among appropriate committees after the method that obtains in the House to occupy the attention of the caucus. A resolution providing for this distribution will be offered as scon as practicable, it is said, by Senator Dubois. There are numer ous candidates for the two elective offices of the Senate. The most prominent one for Secretary is the Hon. George C. Gor ham of California, who held the position for twelve years. No programme has been arranged for the rest of the week after Tuesday, and aside from the introduction of bills and resolutions the transaction of business is not looked for. The first day in the House will be ex hausred by the routine of organization. First, the 356 members and four delegates will have to be sworn in, the roll being called by the clerk of the old House, Hon. James Kerr. Then will come the election of Speaker and the subordinate olricers, in accordance with the results of the Repub lican caucus on Saturday night. In the hurry and confusion of reporting the caucus, which was held behind closed doors, the vote upon the election of a clerk of the caucus was reversed last night. W. 15. Hooker of New York was chosen, not Mr. Ellis of Oregon, his competitor. A rollcall will probably be had upon the election of Speaker, but the other officers, it is expected, will be named together in a resolution, and the resolution adopted viva voce. The usual motions to notify the Senate and to appoint a committee to inform the President will follow, and then, if there be time remaining, the biennial ! lottery known as drawing of seats will take place. An adjourned Democratic caucus will be held- Monday afternoon to select the! persons to be appointed to the several | minor positions allotted to them in the organization of the House. Aside from the introduction of new measures, bills, resolutions, etc., no busi ness is anticipated this week. The adop tion of new rules and the appointment of committees by Speaker Reed are the first matters of general interest and import ance that will be accomplished. 

SCHOONERS SEIZED BY DANES. There Has Been Mo Abatement of the Piracy Practiced Upon the Fishermen. GLOUCESTER. Mass., Dec. I.— The fishing schooner Thomas B. Saunderson, which returned to-day from a fishing cruise off the Greenland coast, bringa in telligence that in spite of the protest of the United States Government some months ago in regard to the seizures by Danish cruisers of American fishing ves sels for violating the three-mile limit, the cruisers have not abated their persecu tions a bit. The fishing ground south of the Davis strait has proved one of the best on the Atlantic coast, and is beinglargely patron ized by American tishermen. All fish far outside the limit, but are captured on some pretext or other and either obliged to pay a fine or be taken to Reikjavik. OVERHAUL Et> fit A CUTTER.

I.— The authori ties to-day received word that the revenue I cutter Ibis had on Thursday last over | hauled a suspicious looking vessel, about thirty miles south of Halifax. The cutter i hoisted a pennant for the vessel to heave to, ! but she kept on her course. The cutter [ immediately started in chase and after an ] hour's run succeeded in bringing .her too. I On going aboard the customs officers were j informed that the vessel had no cargo, but I on searching in I the forecastle a large sup ply of ammunition and rifles were 1 found. It is thought that the vessel was proceed ing to Cuba direct, as her cargo of war amunitions was too small to warrant the trouble, but the customs officers be i lieve that she was hanging round in the | vicinity for the purpose of taking no more | equipments previous to sailing southward. An official inquiry will be made to-mor row. ■'■'"- NOW A MENTAL WRECK i Parnell's Mother Imagines That She Is on the Way to Ireland. I She Is Confined in the Trinity Hos pital and Can Not Long Survive. NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 2.— A morning paper says: Mrs. Delia Stewart Parnell is now lying in Trinity Hospital, No. 50 Varick street, a mental and physical wreck. She thinks she is on her way to Ireland to | see her famous children for the last time, and then to return to her native land, where she may depart in peace. The most casual observer looking at Mrs. Parnell, now an octogenarian, may well doubt if she is capable of crossing the 'Atlantic at tiiis, or, indeed, at any season lof the year. Her days seem to be num bered, and the probability is that she will i never more see tlie land for which she and I her sons and daughters have made such j sacrifices. It is possible, such is the vitality of | which she is possessed, that were it not ! for the cowardly assault upon her in I Bordentown last spring, Mrs.. Parnell would live many years, but, judging from | present appearances, it would be a mis : take for her to leave her present asylum, even were she physically capable. A month or so ago Mrs. Parnell left Ironsides, where she had lived so long, and coming to this city resided tempo rarily with her friend, Mrs. William Knoud. She was even then quite feeble. Her intention was to sail for Ireland on December 1 and visiting Avondale, the home of trie Parnells, prevail upon her married daughter, Mrs. Dickinson, to ac company her to Nice, from the climate of which she hoped good results. This plan was frustrated by her failing health, and in order that she should have all the care proper to her condition she was invited by her cousin, Sister Eleanor, superior of the Trinity Episcopal Hospi tal, to take a room in that institution. English Rails Coming. NEW 

YORK, N. V., Dec. 1.-An im portant shipment of steel rails is to be made soon from Liverpool to the Pacific Coast. Cammell & Co. of Sheffield will be the exporters. The amount is 10,000 tons, costing about $300,000. The sale was effected through Gris.wold & Gillett of No. 66 Broadway, agents of Cammel & Co. They decline to give the name of the pur cnuser. The transaction is extremely sig nificant, being the first large importation of steel rails in tome time. PLUNDERED BY TURKS Tale of Terrible Slaughter Told by Armenians of Erzingan. MASSACRE AT A MARKET. Troops Sent to Preserve Order Joined in the Murder and Pillage. HORRIBLE WAS THE BARBARITY j Hundreds of Defenseless Persons Butchered by the Merciless and Bloodthirsty Mob. WORCESTER, Mass., Dec. I.— The fol lowing petitions, sent by the Armenians of Erzingan to Monsignor Izmirlian, Ar ! menian Patriarch of Constantinople, have been forwarded in duplicate to this city, i where they have been translated and made I public: "To His Holiness, Monsignor Izmirlian, Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople: | On Monday, October 21, while the people from the towns and villaees surrounding Erzingan were gathered together on mar ket day in a public market place of this I city, a vulgar mob, composed of Turks and j Kurds, fully armed, attacked the Arroeni- j ans at 4 o'clock (11 o'clock a. m.), and be gan a wholesale massacre of them, beat ing, wouncMng, killing and slaughtering them, and then dismembering the bodies cl many of them, and tearing them limb j from limb. "During the six hours of this slaughter ! the ferocious mob murdered the unarmed j Armenians with swords, sabers, knives, hatchets, clubs and guns with such horri ble barbarity as has never been seen or heard of before. "Before this, the Armenians, anticipating from the threats of the Turks which they heard, that a horrible calamity was await ing them, had sent their clergy to the local commander of the Turkish army many times during the weeks preceding, implorinu his protection. He told them twice that so long as he was in Erzingan, a massacre would never take place, and said that he considered it unreasonable and cruel to entertain the idea of killing a defenseless and peaceful people. "Relying upon these assurances of the commander, part of the Armenians, feeling safe, went about their daily business. Those especially who went to the market early in the morning, saw with great satis faction tue soldiers, gendarmes and guards scattered about everywhere, watching to maintain peace. In the four quarters of i the city the soldiers were searching the Armenians, and if they found any arms i upon them, they took them away. After j they had thus deceived and robbed and ! entrapped the Armenians, they began to kill them most savagely. These soldiers and guards, who had apparently come to maintain order, not only did not stop the' massacre, but themselves rushed savagely i upon any of the Armenians who dared to j try to defend themselves, desperately as ' any man would do; so that the greater : number of the victims were sacrificed to j the bayonets of the regular soldiers. "This very same day hundreds of our i kindred were sacrificed to that merciless and bloodthirsty mob, and ninety of their ! dead bodies have already been found. "After they had thus butchered the in- \ offensive Armenians they rushed upon j their dead bodies in a most beastly man ner and robbed them, and stripped them from head to foot. On many of the dead i bodies, especially upon the faces and j heads, there were deep marks and cuts of j knives and clubs, and others of them had j been beheaded. Two days after the massacre the corpses were carried in a cart to a certain place and buried in one pit, which we will have to call 'Martyrs' Sepulcher.' There are also many wounded, the creater portion of them fatally. "The pitiful population of Erzingan j might have endured this massacre if it had brought calamity and loss to a few lives only, but it was not so. The real purpose of this massacre was to rob the Armenian stores and houses and make abject beggars of the people, in which purpose they were perfectly successful. "A savage mob composed of 10,000 or 15,000 Turks and Kurds, after putting the Armenians in a state oi terror and night, began to pillace and loot the stores and shops with such rapidity that about 500 of the Armenian markets and stores were ruined ana sacked in a few hours. The merchants' stock of rice, flour, grain and provisions, the apothecaries' drugs, the tradesmen's tools and the carpenters' benches even were not exempted from the general plunder and booty. "The Turkish citizens in their stores and places of business were constantly en couraging the pillagers and calling out to them to be faithful and loyal to their duty against the enemies of Allah (God). Even the soldiers and officers took part in the pillage. Serbahan and Mutuni were sacked and burned. A great many lives also were sacrificed. The population of the nearest villages, especially Serbahan and Mutuni, barefooted and half naked, leading their children by their hands, fled to the city. These fugitives and most of the popula tion of the city are naked and on the verge of starvation. Even if they had money they could not buy any bread because all of the bakeries are closed. "The abject poverty, the burning vil lages from day to day, the constant fear of fresh massacres, the danger that the chol era, which generally follows the crowding of the people together, will break out, the fact that the markets have been robbed and destroyed, the distressing destitution of the people, all these calamities have re duced the poor people to such a dreadful condition that language of man ia not able to describe it." . ■'■",' .' ♦ . AT, WA TS THE A MEN I A NS. Of Course They Are Blamed by the TwrA-.t for All the Outrages. WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 1.-The Turkish Legation received from the Sub lime Porte the following telegram under to-day's date: "The Armenian rioters of Zile at Sivas having closed their shops and fired on the Mussulmans, kiiling one of them, an affray occurred during which four Mussulmans, out of whom two were soldiers, and five Armenians were killed. The necessary measures were taken for the restoration of order. "The Armenian revolutionists attacked the district of Enderin, burned the palace of the governor and plundered the neigh boring Mussulman villages. Troops were sent out for the repression of these dis orders." DESTITUTIOX AT HARPOOT. There Is Great Danger of Hundreds of Armenians Starving to Death. LONDON, Exc, Dec. I.— The represen tative at Constantinople of The United Press, telegraphing under yesterday's date, pictures a pitible condition of affairs at Harpoot, where the "American mission buildings were burned at the time of the recent massacre there. The representa tive of The United Press has received aa vices from Harpoot showing that there is great danger of hundreds of the poorer classes of Armenians starving to death. Tne peril that confronts these people is an immediate one. They are absolutely with out food and without the means of getting any. . ' The American missionaries have sent thousands of dollars to relieve this dis tress, Dut the sums furnished by them have gone only a little way to ward off the famine which threatens. The money has been expended as advantageously as pos sible, but there are so many persons who are homeless, foodless and helpless that nothing but Government relief will save them from a great disaster. The people : are now in a condition of apathy, and many of them, it is believed, would welcome death at the hands of their enemies rather than to wait the slow pro cess of starvation. Some, however, who have a little money, or who have been se cretly assisted by comparately well-to-do compatriots, are fleeing to small places in the interior, where they hope to better their miserable condition. They run the risk of being massacred en route as the Government will furnish them not the slightest protection. Those Armenians who have fled to Con stantinople think that in the capital they would be more or less under the protec tion of the representatives of the various powers, but have found their hopes dashed , to the ground. Perhaps if they were al lowed to remain they might find the pro tection they seek. At any rate it is pretty certain that they would 'be safe from cold blooded massacre, but the Government, in the case of ' the refugees, is enforcing the principle of serfdom, that every subject is bound to the soil, ; and every • day large numbers of • Armenians are arrested. At night they are shipped in batches to the places where they were born with the warning that it will be better for them to remain there. F IH Kit ON BX THE TURKS.

Everything Is in Readiness for To-Morrow's Opening. THE STALLS FILLING UP. A Parade of All the Classes Will Be Made To-Morrow Afternoon. NEW YORK JUDGES ARRIVE. Advance Sale of Seats Double That of Last Year— A New York Editor's Views. The horse show will be opened to-mor row morning with a cavalry drill by Troop A of the National Guard. They will be followed by a display of lassoing by the mounted park policemen, and in the afternoon there will be a parade of all the horses in the show in different classes. At 12:30 p. M. President Crocker and the directors will give a lunch in the cafe up stairs, to which they have invited the Gov ernor, Mayor Sutro, Mayor Davie of Oak land, members of the press, the judges and stockholders. There have been about 125 invitations sent out. The table will be ar ranged in the shape of a horseshoe. McKinney, 2:11)£, followed by his son» Tombro, was the first of the equine "400" to show up at the Pavilion. They were taken in by their owner, C. A. Durfee of Los Angeles. John F. Boyd's string of a dozen thoroughbreds followed shortly after, and by night many of the stalls were tilled. Everything will be in shape for to morrow's opening in good time, as the directors have kept ahead with their work and are not worrying themselves as much, as they were last year.. The boxes are all sold and nearly all the reserved seats for the evenings, and the managers anticipate a much larger attend ance than last year, particularly as the price of admission during the daytime has been reduced to 50 cents with no seats re served. Governor Budd will not attend on the opening night as he at first intended, but will be there with his staff Wednesday. Three boxes have been reserved for his party for that evening in the center of the Polk-street end. The work of laying the clay and tanbark in the arena kept a lot of men and teams busy all day yesterday. Most of the horses that came in yesterday will be exercised in it to-day. Carpenters were busy put ting the finishing touches in the stall 9. Much complaint was made last year of the old benches which the spectators had to sit on. These have all been removed and chairs substituted. Anotjier com plaint made last year was of the draught from behind the seats. To obviate this boardings have been put up .There are 2000 seats downstairs and 1000 upstairs These, with the boxes, will give a seating capacity of nearly 4000. Another welcome change that has been made is the widen ing of all the passages and aisles to enable the people to pass from the seats to tho promenades and back with comfort. The seats have all been divided into sections, which are indicated with large placards giving the letters and numbers that corre spond to those on the tickets, so that hold ers may see at a glance where their places are. A squad of forty ushers wore being drilled yesterday. None of them were professional ushers, but most of them acted in the same capacity at the last show and few complaints were made. President Crocker said yesterday that many of the visitors did not seem last year to appreciate the fact that they were en titled to go through the stables to look at the horses. "To many people," he said, "this should NEW
