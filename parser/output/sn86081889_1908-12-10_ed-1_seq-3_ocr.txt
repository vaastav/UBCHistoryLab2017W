THE MESSAGE Washington, D.C. Th Presidents message was read before both tho Senate and the House:, following the opening of Congress. It Is, In part, as follows: To the Senate and House of Repre i sentatlvps: The financial standing of the Na tion at the present time is excellent, and the financial management of the Nation's Interests by the Government during the lant seven years has shown the most satisfactory results. But our currency system Is Imperfect, and It is earnestly to be hoped that the Currency Commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. The President's Message then tales that during the past seven years and three months there has been a net surplus of nearly one hundred millions ofTecelpts over expenditures, a reduction of tho Interest bearing debt by ninety millions, In spite of the extraordinary expense of the Pan ama Canal, and a saving of nearly nine minions on the nnnual Interest charge. This Is an exceedingly satis factory showing, especially In view of the fact that during this period tho Nation has never hesitated to under take any expenditure that It regarded as necessary. There hnvo been no new taxes and no increases of taxes; on the contrary some taxes have been taken off: there has been a reduction of taxation. As regards the great corporations engaged In Interstate business, and especially the rallronds. I ran only repent what I have alrendy again and again said In my messages to the Con gress. I helleve that under the Inter state clause of the Constitution the United Sfntes has complete and para mount right to control all agencies of Interstate commerce, and I believe that the National Government alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure justice from, and to do Justice to. the great corporations which are the most Important factors In modern business. I believe that It is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all combina tions as Is done by the Sherman anti trust law, because such a law can be enforced Only, Imperfectly and une qunlly. and Its enforcement works al most as much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that Instead of an unwise effort to prohibit all combina tions, there shall be substituted a law which shall expressly permit combin ations which are In the interest of the p'lblle. but shall at the same time give to some agency of the National Government full power of control and supervision over them. One of the chief features of this control should 1" securing entire publicity in nl! matters which the public has a right to know, and furthermore, the power, not by Judicial but by executive ac tion, to prevent or put a stop to every form of Imnropor favoritism or other wrongdoing. The railways of the country should be put completely under the Inter state Commerce Commission and re moved from the domain of the anti trust law. The power of the Com mission should be made thorough going, so that It could exercise com plete supervision and control over the Issue of securities as well' as over the raising and lowering of rates. As re gards rates, at least, this power should be summary. The power to Investigate the financial operations and accounts of the railways has been one of the most valuable features In recent legislation. Power to make combinations and traffic agreements should be explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of the Commission being first gained and the combination or agreement being published In all Its details. In the Interest of the nubile the representa tives of the public should have com plete power to see that tho railroads do their duty by the public, and as a matter of course this power should also be exercised so as to see that no Injustice Is done to the railroads. The shareholders, the employes and the shippers all have interests that must be guarded. It is to the Interest of all of them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed, nr.d that there should be no Improoer Issuance of securities. The guiding intelligences necessary for the suc cessful building and successful man agement of railroads should receive ample remuneration, but no man should be allowed to make money In connection with railroads out of frau dulent over-capitalization and kin dred stock gambling performances; there must be no defrauding of in vestors, oppression of the farmers and business men wno ship freight, or callous disregard of the rights and needs of the employes. In addition to tbla the Interests of the sharehold ers, of the employes, and of the ship pers should all be guarded as against one another. To give any one of thjm undue arid Improper consideration Is to do injustice to the others. Rees must be made as low as Is compatible with giving proper returns to all the employes of the railroad, from the highest to the lowest, and proper re turns to the shareholders, but they must not, for Instance, be reduced in such fashion as to necessitate i cut In the wages of the employes or the abo lition of the proper and legitimate profits of honest shareholder!. Telegraph and telephone companies engaged In Interstate business should be put under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It Is very earnestly to be wished that our people, through their repre sentatives, should act in this matter. It Is hard to say whether most dam ago to the country at large would come from entire allure on the part of the public to supervise and control the actions of the great corporations. or from the exercise of the necessary F.W.--1 imi power in a wav which would do Injustice and wrong to the corporations. Both the preachers of an unrestricted Individualism and tho preachers of an oppression which would deny to able men of business the Just reward of their Initiative and business sagacity, are advocating pol icies that would bo fraught with tho gravest harm to the whole country. It Is to tho Interest of all of us that there should be a premium put upon Individual Initiative and Individual capacity, and an ample reward for ' great airecung intelligences alone competent to manage the great busl ness operations of to-day. It Is well to keep In mind that exactly as the annrchlst is the worst enemy of lib erty and tho reactionary the worst enemy or order, so tho men who de fond tho rights of property have moat to fear from the wrongdoers of great wenit,n. and tne men who are cham pioning popular rights have most to fear from tho dnmagogues who in th name of popular rights would d wrong to oppress honest business men, honest men of wealth; for the success of either type of wrongdoer neceasarlty Invites a violent reaction agalnpt the cause the wrongdoer nom Inally upholds. In point of dnncer t the Nntlon there Is nothing to choose between on the one hand the corrnp tlonlst. the bribe-gjver, the brlhe-tnk er, the man who employs his great talent to swindle his fellow-cltlzens on a large scale, and. on the otlie hand, the prearher of class hatred the man who, whether from Ignor ance or from willingness to sacrifice his country to his ambition, persuades wen moaning but wrong-headed men to try to destroy the Instruments upon which our prosperity mainly rests. Let each group of men beware of and guard against the shortcom Ings to which that group is itself most name. The opposition to Government con trol of these great corporations makes Its most effective effort in the shape of an appeal to the old doctrine of btntes' rights. Of course there are many sincere men who now believe In unrestricted Individualism in busl ness. Just as there were formerly mnny sincere men who believed In slavery that is. In the unrestricted right of an individual to own anottur individual. These men do not by themselves have grent weight, how ever. The effective fight against ade quate Government control and suner- vislon of Individual, and especially of corporate, wenlth engaged In Inter state business Is chleflv done under cover, end esneclnlly under cover of nu appeal to States' rights. It Is not at all Infrequent to read In the same speech a denunciation of predatory wealth fostered by special privilege ann tenant of both the public welfare and law of the land, and a denuncln tlon of centralization In the Central Government of the power to deal with this centralized and organized wealth Of course the policy set forth In such twin denunciations amounts to ahso lutFly nothing, for the first half Is nullified by the second half. The chief reason, among the many sound and compelling reasons, that led to the formation of the National Govern ment. was the absolute need that the Union, and not the several States should deal with Interstate and for elgn commerce; and the power ro deal with Interstate commerce was granted absolutely and plenarily to the Cen tral Government, and was exercised completely as regards the only in sirumems or interstate commerce known In those days the waterways, the highroads, as well as the partner- snips of Individuals who then con ducted all of what business there was Interstate commerce is now chiefly conducted by railroads, and the great corporation has sunplanted the mass or small partnerships or Individuals. The proposal to make the National Government Bupreme over, and tljere- iure to give it complete control over, the railroads and other Instruments of interstate commerce Is merelv a proposal to carry out to the letter one of tho prime purposes. If not the prime purpose, for which the Consti tution was founded. We do not object to the concentra tion of wealth and administration: but we do believe in the distribution of the wealth in profits to the real owners, and In securing to the public the full benefit of the concentrated administration. We believe that with concentration In administration there can come both the advantage of a larger ownership and of a more equit able distribution of profits, and at the same time a better service to the commonwealth. Many laws are needed. There should be regulation by the National Government of the great interstate corporations. Including a simple method of account keeping, publicity, supervision of the Issue of securities, abolition of rebates and of special privileges. There should be short time franchises for all corporations engaged In public business; Includ ing the corporations which get powtr from water rights. There should be National as well as State guardian shin of mlnes'and forests. There are many matters affecting labor and the status of the wage worker to which I should like to draw your attention, but an exhaustive dis cussion of the problem In all Us us- pects Is not now necessary. This administration is nearlng its end; and, moreover, under our form of government the solution of the prob lem depends upon tho action of the States as much as upon the action of the Nation. Nevertheless, there are certain considerations which I wish to set before you. because I hone that our people will more and more keep them In mind. A blind and Ig norant resistance to every effort for the reform of abuses and for the read justment of society to modern Indus trial conditions represents not true conservatism but an Incitement to the wildest radicalism; for wise radical Ism and wise conservatism go hand In hand, one bent on progress, the other bent on seeing that no change is mane unless In the right direction. I believe In a steady effort, or per haps It would be more accurate to any In steady efforts In many different directions, to bring about a condition of affairs under Which the men who work with hand or brain, the labor ers, the superintendents, the men who produce for the market and the men who find a market for the arti cles produced, shall own a far great er share than at present of the wealth they produce, and be enabled to In vest It In the tools and Instruments by which all work Is carried on. As far as possible I hopo to see a frank recognition of the advantages con ferred by machinery, organization, and division of labor, accompanied by an effort to brlr,s; about a larger share In the ownership by wage-worker of railway, mill, and factory. In farming, this simply means that wo wish to see the farmer own his own land; we do not wish to see the farms so large that they become the prop erty of absentee landlords who farm them by tenants, nor yet so small that the farmer becomes like a Eu ropean peasant. Again, the deposit ors in our savings banks now number over one-tenth of our entire popula tion. These are all capitalists, who ttirough the savings banks loan their money to the workers that Is, In many cases to themselves to carry on their various industries. The more we Increase their number, the more we introduce the principles of co-op erntloh Into our Industry. Every In crease In the number of small stock holders In corporations Is a good thing, for tho same reasons; and where the employes are the stockhol ders the result Is particularly good. Very much of this movement must bo outside of anything that can be accomplished by legislation; but leg islation can do a good deal. Postal savings banks will make It easy for the poorest to keep their snvlngs In absolute safety. The regulation of the national highways mtist be such that they shall serve all people with equal justice. Corporate finances must be supervised so as to make It far safer than at present for the man of small means to Invest his money in stocks. Thore'must be prohibition of child labor, diminution of woman labor, shortening of hours of all me chanical labor; stock watering should be prohibited, and stock gambling so far ns possible discouraged. There should be a progressive Inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial ed ucation should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium upon thrift, hard work and business energy, but these qualities cease to be the main factors In accumulating a fortune long before that fortune reaches a point where It would be seriously uf fected by any Inheritance tax such as I propose. It Is eminently right that the Nation should fix the terms upon which the great fortunes are inherit ed. They rarely do good and they of ten do harm to those who inherit them in their entirety. rhe President then devotes a chap ter to "protection for wagework- ers. He says there should be no nal- terlng with the question of taking care of those who become crippled or worn out In our Industrial system. He urges proper employers' liability laws. He also calls attention to the steps toward providing old-age pen sions that have been taken by many private Industries. He urges Con gress to pass a comprehensive em ployers' liability law for the District of Columbia. The President devotes much space to the subject of the courts. First he urges increased pay for our judges und then says: It is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for doing away with the long delays which now obtain In the administra tion of Justice, and which operate witn peculiar severity agalnBt persons of small means, and favor onlv the very criminals whom It Is most desir able to punish. These long delays In the final decisions of cases make In the aggregate a crying evil, and remedy should be devised. Much of this intolerable delay Is due to im proper regard paid to technicalities which are a mere hindrance to jus tice. In some noted recent cases this over-regard for technicalities has re sulted In a striking denial of justice, and flagrant wrong to the body poli tic. At the last election certain leaders of organized labor made a violent and weeping attack upon the entire judi ciary of the country, an attack couched In such terms ns to include the moBt upright, honest and broad minded Judges, no less than those of narrower mind and more restricted utlook. It was the kind of attack admirably fitted to prevent any sue cessful attempt to reform abuses of the Judiciary, because It gave the champions of the unjust judge their eagerly desired opportunity to shift their ground into a cWamplonshlp of ust judges who were unjustlv as sailed. Last year, before the House Committee on the Judiciary, these same labor leaders formulated their emands, specifying the bill that con tained them, refusing all compromise. stating they wished the principle of that bill or nothing. They Insisted on a provision that in a labor dispute no Injunction should Issue except to protect a property right, and specifi cally provided that the right to carry on business should not be construed as a property right, and in a second provision their bill made legal in a la bor dispute any act or agreement by or between two or more persons that would not have been unlawful If done by a single person. In other words, this bill legalised blacklisting and boycotting In every form, legalizing, for Instance, those forms of tho sec ondary boycott which the anthracite coal strike commission so unreserv- carry on a business was explicitly taken out from nnder that protection wnicn tne law throws over properlr. The demand waa made that there should be trial by Jury In contempt cases, thereby most seriously Impair ing the authority of the courts. All this represented a course of policy which, If carried out, would mean the enthronement of class privilege In Its crudest and most brutal form, and the destruction of one of the moBt essen tial function of the judiciary In all civilized lands. The wageworkers.the worklngmen, the laboring men of the country by the way In which they repudiated the effort to get them to cast their votes In response to an appeal to class ha tred, have emphasized their sound patriotism and Americanism. The whole country has cause to feel pride In this attitude of sturdy Independ ence, In this uncompromising Insist ence upon acting simply as good citi zens, as good Americans, without re gard to fancied and improper class Interests. Such an attitude Is an ob ject lesson In good citizenship to the entire nation. to edly condehined; while the rlgiit to badly. But the extreme reactionaries, the persons who blind themselves to the wrongs now and then committed by tne courts on laboring men, should also think seriously ns to what such a movement as this portends. Th Judges who have shown themselves noie aim willing effectively to check tne dishonest activity of the very rid man who works Iniquity by the nils management of corporations, xvh have shown themselves nlert tn H Justice to the wageworker, and sym puineiic witn xne needs or tho mass or our people, so that the dweller I the tenement houses, the man wh practices a niingerous trade, tho man who Is crushed by excessive hours ol labor, feel that their needs are under stood by the courtB these Indeed nrt the real bulwark of the courts; these .lunges, the Judges of the stamp o the President-elect, who have been fearless In opposing labor when It has gone wrong, but fearless also In hold ing to strict account corporations that work iniquity, and far sighted In see ing that the worklngrnan gets his rights are the men of all others to whom we owe It that the appeal for such violent ana mistaken lec'-latlon ha fallen on deaf ears, that the agitation ror us passage proved to be wlrhou aiiusiHiiuHi uasis. i ne courts arp Jeoparded primarily by the action of these Federal and State Judges who snow inability or unwillingness t put a stop to the wrongdoing or ver ricn men under modern lndustrln conditions, and Inability or unwilling ness to give relief to men of small menus or wageworgors who are crushed down by these modern Indus trial conditions; who. In other words tail to understand and apply the needed remedies for the new wrongs produced by the new and highly com plex social and industrial civilization which has grown up In the last hal century. There are certain decisions hv va Nous courts which have been exceed Ingly detrimental to the rights o wngeworkers. This is true of all the decisions that decide that men and women are, by the Constitution 'guaranteed their llbertv." to con tract to enter a dangerous occupation or to worK an undesirable or linnro per number of hours, or to work in unhealthy surroundings, and there fore can not recover damages when maimed in that occupation, and can not be forbidden to work whnt the Legislature decides Is an excessive number of hours, or to carry on the work under conditions which the L,oalslature decides to be unhealthy There Is also. I think, ground for the belief that substantial Inlustlreis often suffered by employes In conse quence of the custom of courts Issu ing temporary injunctions without notice to them, and punishing them for contempt of court In instances where, as a matter of fact, they have no knowledge of any nroceedlnes. Outside of organized labor there Is a widespread feeling that this system often works great Injustice to wage workers when their efforts to better their working condition results In In dustrial disputes. A temporary in junction procured ex parte may as a matter of fact have all the effect of a permanent Injunction In causing dis aster to the wagoworkers' side in such a dispute. Organised labor is chafing under the unjust restraint which comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Its discontent has been unwisely expressed, and of ten Improperly expressed, but there Is a sound baRls for It, and the orderly ann law abiding people of a commu nity would be In a far stronger posi tion for upholding the courts If the undoubtedly existing abuses could be provided against. The power of Injunction Is a great equitable remedy, which should on no account be destroyed. But safeguards should be erected against its abuse. For many of tho shortcomings of justice In our country our people as a whole are themselves tb blame, and the Judges and Juries merely bear their share together with the public ns a whole. It is discreditable to us as a people that there should be diffi culty in convicting murderers, or in bringing to Justice men who as pub lic servants have been guilty of cor ruption, or who have profited by tho corruption of public servants. The result Is equally unfortunate, whether due to hair-splitting technicalities In the Interpretation of law by judges, to sentimentality and class conscious ness on the part of juries, or to hys teria and sensationalism In the dally press. For much of this failure of Justice no responsibility whatever lies on rich men as such. We who make up the mass of the people can not shift the responsibility from our own shoulders. But there Is au important part of the failure which has specially to do with Inability to hold to proper account men of wealth who behave The chief breakdown Is in dcnllnc with the new relations that nrlse from the mutualism, tho Interdepen dence of our time. Every new social relation begets a new type of wrong doing of sin, to use an old-fashioned word -and many years always elapBe before roclety is able to turn this sin Into crime which can be ef fectively punished at law. Dining the lifetime of tho older men now alive the social relations have changed far more rapidly than In the preceding two centuries. The Im mense growth of corporations, of business done by associations, and the extreme strain and pressure of mod ern life, have produced condltldns which render the public confused as to who its reslly dangerous foes are; and among the public servnntB who have not only shared this confusion, but by some of their acts have In creased It, arp certain Judges. Marked Inefficiency has been shown In dealing with corporations and In re-settllng the proper attitude to be taken hy the public not only toward corporations, but toward labor, and toward the so cial questions arising out of the fac tory system, and tho enormous growth of our great cities. The huge wealth that haR been ac cumulated by a few Individuals of re cent years, In what has amounted to a social and Industrial revolution, has been as regards some of these Indi viduals made possible only by the Im proper URe of the modern corporation. A certain type of modern corpora tion, with Its officers and agents. Its many Issues of securities, and its con stant consolidation with allied under takings, finally heroines an instru ment so complex ns to contnln n greater number of elements that, un der various Judicial decisions, lend themselves to fraud and oppression than any device yet evolved In the hu man brain. Corporations are neces sary instruments of modern business. They have been permitted to become a mennco largely because the govern mental representatives of the people have worked slowly In providing for adequate control over them. The chief offender In anv given case may be an executive, a Legislat ure or a judge. Every executive head who advises violent, instead of grad ual, action, or who advocates ill-considered and sweeping measures of re form Especially If they are tnlnfed with vlndlctlveness. and disregard for the rights of the minority) Is particu larly blameworthy. The several leg islatures are responsible for the fact that our laws are often prepared with slovenly haste and lack of considera tion. Moreover, they are often pre pared, and still more frequently amended during passage, at the sug gestion of the very parties against whom they are afterward enforced. Our great clusters of cornoratlons. huge trusts and fabulously wealthy multimillionaires, employ the very best lawyers they can obtain to pick flaws In these statutes after their passage, but they also employ a cltrss of secret agent who seek, under the advice of experts, to render hostfle legislation Innocuous by making It unconstitutional, often through the Insertion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping provisions against the Interests of the parties Inspiring them; while the dema gogues, the corrupt creatures who In troduce blackmailing schemes to 'strike" corporations, and all who de mand extreme, and undesirably radi cal, measures, show themselves to be the worst enemies of the very public whosp loud mouthed champions they profess to be. Real damage has hppn done by.the manifold and conflicting Interpreta tions of the Interstate commerce law. Control over the great corporations doing1 Interstate business can be ef fective only If It Is vested with full power In an administrative depart ment, a branch of the Federal execu tive, candying out a Federal law; if can never be effective If a divided re sponsibility Is left In both the States and the Nation: It can never be ef fective If left In the hands of the courts to be decided by lawsuits. In no other nation In the world do the courts wield such vast and far reaching power as In the United States. All that Is necessary Is that the courtB as a whole should exercise this power with the far sighted wis dom already shown bv those Judges who scan the future while thev act in tho present. Lpt them exercise this great power not onlv honestlv and bravely, but with wise Insight Into the needs and fixed purposes of the people, so that they may do justice and work eqnlty, so that they may protect all persons In their rights and yet break down the barriers of privilege, which Is the foe of right The President devotes a long chap- er to the subject of forests, declaring that If there Is one dnty which more than another we owe to our children and our children's children. It Is to ave the forests of this countrv. for they consfltnte the first and most Im portant element In the conservation of our natural resources. The Messago then turns to Inland aterways and maintains that action or their lmnrnvement should begin forthwith. It Is also urged that all our National parks adjacent to Na tional forests be placed under the con- rol of the forest service of the Agri cultural Department. I am happy to say, continnes Mr. Roosevelt, that I have been able to set aside In various parts of the country small, well- chojen tracts of ground to serve ns sanctuaries and nurseries for wild creatures. The Message announces that tho se In the arts and Industries of de atured alcohol is making fair progress and the law making It pos- IDle Is entitled to further support from the Congress. According to the President, the pure food legislation has already worked a benefit difficult o overestimate. In the paragraph on he Indian service the Message tells how It has been completely removed from the atmosphere of political ac tivity and the ground cleared for larger constructive work to prepare the Indians for responsible citizen ship. The President regrets that an amendment was Incorporated In tho measure providing for the Secret Ser vice forbidding detnlls and transfers therefrom. He declares It Is of ben efit, only to the criminal classes. He renews his recommendations for pos tal savings banks and urges nn exten tlon of the parcel post on the rural routes. He declares that the unfor tunate state of affairs as regards tho National educational office be reme died by adequate appropriations. He strongly urges that the supervisors and enumerators for tho approaching Census be not appointed under the Civil Service law, but that appoint ments to tho force be done under that law, geographical requirements be ing waived. The President main tains that there t'honld be Intelligent action on the question of preserving the health of the country nnd sug gests a redistribution of the health bureaus. He recommends the plac ing of the Government Printing Office under the Department of Commerce nnd Labor nnd the various Soldier' Homes under the War Department. He advocates the Immediate ndmls slon of New Mexico and Arizona as separate States. Mr. Roosevelt then writes of the Interstate fisheries prob lem, saying that those mutters which no particular State can control Con gress ought to control. The statute regarding game should include fish, and the fur-seal service should be vested In the Bureau of Fisheries. In regard to our foreign policy he announces that It Is bated on the theory that right must prevail be tween nations ns between Individuals nnd then urges the special claims of Latin-American Republics to our at tention. The Message states that the Panama Cnnnl Is being dug with speed and efficiency and then recom mends the extension of ocean mall lines to South America,' Asia, the Philippines nnd Australasia. Atten tion Is called to the admirable condi tion of Hawaii, where coolie labor has practically ceased an.1 Pearl Har bor is being made n l.aval base with the necessary military fortficatlons. Real progress, the President contin ues, toward self-government Is being made In the Philippines, bul it would be worse than folly to prophesy the exact date when It will be wise to consider Independence as a fixed nnd definite policy. It Is recommended that American citizenship be. conferred upon the people of Porto Illco and announcement iB made that our occu pancy of Cuba will end in about two months' time. The Cubans are warned that they must govern them selves within in order to avoid gov ernment from without. The Presi dent hopes Americans will do what is possible to make the Japanese Im position of 1917 a success nnd then thanks Japan, Australia, New Zealand nnd the States of South America for their hospitality to tho battle fleet. Mr. Roosevelt urges the passage of the bill to promote army' officers at reasonable ages through a process of selection and declares the cavalry arm should be reorganized upon modern lines. We have not enough Infantry and artillery and attention should be centred on the machine gun. A gen eral service corps should be estab lished. It behooves the Government to perfect tho efficiency of the Na tional Guard as a part of the National forces and Congressional aid should be extended to those who are pro moting rifle practice teaching our men to shoot. In regards to the navy, the Presi dent recommends the Increase sug gested by the General Board nnd thinks the General Board should be tnrnod into a General Staff. He urges that two hospital ships be provided end then concludes his Message as follows: Nothing better for the Navy from every standpoint ha3 ever occurred than the cruise of the battle fleet around the world. The Improvement of the ships In every way has been extraordinary, and they have gained far more experience in battle tactic3 thnn they would have gained If they had stayed in the Atlantic water. The American people have cause for profound gratification, both in view of tho excellent condition of the fleet as shown by this cruise, and in view of the improvement the cruise has worked In this already high condi tion. I do not believe that there Is any other service In the world In which the average of character and efficiency In the enlisted men Is as high us Is now the case in our own. I believe that the same statement can be made as to our officers, taken as a whole; but there must be a reserva tion made In regard to those In the highest ranks as to which I have already spoken and in regard to those who have Just entered the ser vice; because we do not now get full benefit from our excellent naval school at Anrnpolis. It Is absurd not to graduntu the midshipmen us en signs; to keep them for two years in Buch au anomalous position as at present the law requires Is detri mental to them nnd to the service. In the academy lUelf, every first class man should be required In turn to serve as petty officer and officer; his ability to discharge his duties as such should be a prerequisite to his going Into the line, und Ills success In com manding should largely determine his standing at graduation. The Board of Visitors should ho appointed in January, and each member should be required to give at least six days' service, only from one to three days' to be performed during June week, which Is the least desirable time for the board to he at Annapolis so far as benefiting the navy by their observ tlons is concerned. .

It Is frequently a matter of remark that tho children and successors of goodly people do not manifest the fervent piety and love which marked their fathers. And people sometimes Inveigh against this manifestation of the degeneracy of the times In which we live, says H. L. Hastings, In an article on apostasy nnd degeneracy. But It Is possible that they overlook one fact, which, if recollected, would fully explain the evils of which they complain. The one vital fact bearing on this question Is. that righteous ness or piety is not hereditary. No man, however good or gracious his parentage nay have been. Is born so well that he does not need to be born again. Religion is not transmlssable by descent. Hence, the entire work of regeneration, conversion or renew ing of heart and life, has to be re peated with each successive genera tion. It was vain for the Jews to say. We have Abraham for our fathpr." It is equally vain for us to boast of pious ancestors, and saintly fathers and mothers, when the onlv thing that can save the children of the best parents Is a thorough conversion to God and a personal acquaintance with the Lord Jesus Christ. We are not therefore to think it strange that the children of good peo ple go wrong.orthat they fail to man ifest tho fervor and faith of their pre decessors. We are to look to God for the renewal and salvation of our off spring, knowing that unless thev re pent and find salvation they will sure ly perish as though they were the children of the vilest sinners that ever lived. Prayer. Go not, my friend, Into the danger ous world without prayer. You kneel cown at night to pray, and drowsi ness weighs down your evellds- a hard day's work is a kind of excuse and you shorten your prayer, and re sign yourself Boftly to repose. Tho morning breaks, and it may be you rise late, and so your earlv devotion,. I are not done or are done with irreir- ' ' 1u waicning unto pray erful wakefulness once more omitted, and now Is that reparable? We sol emnly believe not. There has been that done which can not be undone You have given up your prayer, and you will suffer for it. Temptation is before you, and you are not ready to meet it. There is a guilty feeling on the soul, and you lingor at a dlBtance from God. It is no marvel if that day in which you suffer drowsiness to interfere with prayer be a day In which you shrink from duty Mo ments of prayer Intruded on by sloth can not be made up. We may exper ience but we can not get back the rich freshness and strength which we wrapped up in those moments Frederick W. Robertson. The Argument of Our Longing. This heart-hunger for God, which is the deepest reading of human his tory is a tacit argument for that which will supply It. We expect cor respondence between an Instinct and that which will satisfy It, between a faculty and Its object, between a need and its fulfillment. We were made for God. It Is written In every as piration, and breathed in everv prav er; we were born for the love of God.
