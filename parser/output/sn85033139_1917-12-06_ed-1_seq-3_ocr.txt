WILSON DEMANDS WAR ON AUSTRIA President Declares Our Sole Ob ject Now Is to Win the War. UNITED TO GAIN VICTORY Every Resource of the Nation Must Be Co-ordinated in the One Object to Pursue the War to Ultimate and Complete Victory. Washington, I tec. 4. —President Wll on in his message to congress pledged America to war to victory and asked that Austria-Hungary be listed among America’s enemies to remove this “em barrassing obstacle that stands in our way.” The message follows; “Gentlemen of the Congress—Eight months have elapsed since I last had the honor of addressing you. They have been months crowded with events of Immense and grave significance for us. 1 shall undertake to detail or even to summarize these events. The prac tical particulars of the part we have played in them will he laid before you In the reports of the executive depart ments. I shall discuss only our pres ent outlook upon these vast affairs, our present duties, and the immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always in view. “1 shall not go hack to debate the causes of the war. The Intolerable wrongs done and planned against us by the sinister masters of Germany have long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true Amer ican to need to be rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider again and with a very grave scrutiny our objec tives and the measures by which we mean to attain them; fpr the purpose of discussion here in this place Is ac tion, and our action must move straight towards definite ends. Must Win the Wr. “Our object Is, of course, to win the war; and we shall not slacken or suf fer ourselves to-be diverted until It is won. But It is worth while asking and answering the question: When shall we consider the war won? “From one point of view It is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. Ido not doubt that the Amer ican people know what the war Is about and what sort of an outcome they will regard ns a realization of their purpose In It. Asa nation we are united In spirit and Intention. I pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. 1 hear the voices of dis sent—who does not? I hear the criti cism and the clamour of the noisy, thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men here and there fling them selves In impotent disloyalty against the calm, Indomitable poster of the na tion. I hear men debate pence who understand neither its nature nor the way in which we obtain it with uplift ed eyes and unbroken spirits. But I known that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten. No Peace by Compromise. “But from another point of view I believe that it is necessary to say plainly what we here at the sea, of ac tion consider the war to be for and what part we mean to play In the set tlement of its searching Issues. “We are the spokesmen of the Amer ican people, and they have a right to know whether their purpose is ours. They desire peace by the overcoming of evil, by the defeat once for all of the sinister forces that Interrupt peace and render It impossible, and they wish to know how closely our thought runs with theirs, and what ac tion we propose. They are Impatient with those who desire peace by any sort of compromise—deeply and indig nantly impatient—but they will he equally Impatient with ns If we do not make It plain to them what our ob jectives are and what we are planning for In seeking to make conquest of peace by arms. Menace Must Be Crushed. “1 believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that this Intolerable thing of which the masters of Germany have shown us the ugly face, this menace of com bined intrigue and force which we now see so clearly as the German power, a Thing without conscience or honor or capacity for covenanted peace, must he crushed and, If it is not utterly brought to an end, at least shut out from the friendly Intercourse of the nations; and, second, when this Thing and its power are indeed defeated and the time comes that we can discuss peaco—when the German people have spokesmen whose words we can be lieve and when those spokesmen are ready In the name of their people to accept the common Judgment of the nations as to what shall hence forth be the bases of law and of cov-

We know what that price will he. It will he full. Impartial Jus tice—Justice done at every point and to every nation that the final settle ment must affect, our enemies as well us our friends. Final and Convincing Lesson. “You catch with me, the voices of humanity that nre In the air. They grow daily more audible, more articu late, more persuasive, and they come from the hearts of men everywhere. They Insist that the war shall not end In vindictive action of any kind: that no nation or people shall be robbed or punished because the Irresponsible rulers of a single country have them selves done deep and damnable wrong. It Is this thought that has been ex pressed in the formula ‘No annexa tions, no contributions, no punitive In demnities,’ .lust because this crude formula expresses the Instinctive Judg ment as to right of plain men every where, It has been made diligent use of by the masters of German Intrigue to lead the people of Russia astray — and the people of every country their agents could reach. In order that a premature peace might be brought about before autocracy has been taught Its final and convincing lesson, and the people of the world put in control of their own destinies.” Right as the Arbiter. “But the fnct that a wrong use has been made of a just idea Is no reason why a right use should not be made of It. It (night to he brought under the patronage of its real friends. Let It he said again that autocracy must first be shown the niter futility of its claims to power or leadership In the modern world. It Is Impossible to apply any standard of justice so tong ns such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the present masters of Germany command. Not until this has been done can Right be set up as arbiter and peacemaker among the nations. But when that has been done-- as. God willing. It assuredly will be—we shall at last be free to do an unprecedented thing, and this the time to avow our purpose to do It. We shall he free to base peace on generosity and Justice, to the exclusion of all selfish claims to advantage even on the part of the vic tors. To Win War Our Present Task. "Let there he no misunderstanding. Our present and immediate task Is to win the war. and nothing shall turn us aside from It until It is accomplished. Kvery power and resource we possess, whether of men, of money, or of ma terials, is being devoted and will con tinue to be devoted to that purpose until It is achieved. Those who de sire to bring peace about before that purpose is achieved I counsel to carry their advice elsewhere. We will not entertain it. We shall regard the war as won only when the German people say to us, through properly accredited representatives, that they nre ready to agree to a settlement based upon Jus tice and the reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done. They have done a wrong to Belgium which must be repaired. They have established a power over other lands and people than their own—over the great empire of Austria-Hungary, other hitherto free Balkan states, over Turkey, and within Asia —which must he relinquished. Must End German Autocracy. “Germany’s success by skill, by in dustry. by knowledge, by enterprise, we did not grudge or oppose, but ad mired. rather. She had built up for herself a real empire of trade and In fluence, secured by the peace of the world. We were content to abide the rivalries of manufacture, science and commerce that were involved for us In her success and stand or fall as we had or did not have the brains and the Initiative t surpass her. But at the moment when she had conspicuously won her triumphs of peace she threw them away, to establish In their stead what the world will no longer permit to be established, military and political domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel the rivals she most feared and hated. The peace we make must remedy that wrong It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoples of Belgium and north ern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace, but It must also deliver the peoples of Austria- Hungary, (he peoples of the Balkans, and the peoples of Turkey, alike In Europe and In Asia, from the impudent and alien dominion of the Prussian military and commercial autocracy. To Manage Their Own Affairs. “We owe It, however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish in any way to Impair or to re-arrange the Austro- Hungarian empire. If Is no affair of ours what they do with their own life, either Industrially or politically. We do not purpose or desire to dictate to them In any way. We only desire to see that their affairs are left In their own hands. In all matters, great or small. We shall hope to secure for the peoples of the Balkan peninsula and for the people of the Turkish empire the right and opportunity to make their own lives safe; their own for tunes secure against oppression or in justice and free from the dictation of foreign courts or parties. “And our attitude and purpose with tween writers nnd the publicity hu rcnus of permnnent nnd emergency or ganizations dealing with activities of women. It has secured lists of (he personnel of every organization which Is conducting women’s war work in the United States, nnd of every com mittee nnd subcommittee under these organizations.

It will also place Must he capable of marshaling figures, arriving at results and working out decimals with microscopic exactness and lightning rapidity. “Successful applicant must possess the patience of Job nnd the Infallibil ity of a pope, must he endowed with miraculous powers, capable of Judging at sight with mathematical precision exact quantities, weights, qualities, sizes and value of thousands of boots In various stages of manufacture. He must have Inexhaustible energy and be capable vt working 24 hours a day regard to Germany herself nre of a like kind. We intend no wrong against the German empire; no Interference with her Internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the other ab solutely unjustifiable, absolutely con trary to the principles we have pro fessed to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a na tion. German People Deceived. "The people of Germany are being told by the men whom they now per mit to deceive them and to net as their masters that they are fighting for the very life and existence of their em pire; a war of desperate self-defense against deliberate aggression. Nothing could be more grossly or wantonly false, and we mast seek by the ut most openness and candor ns to our real aims to convince them of Its false ness. We nre in fnct fighting for Ihelr emancipation from fear, along with our own—from the fenr as well as from the fact of unjust attack by neighbors or rivals or schemers after world empire. No one Is threaten ing the existence of or the indepen dence or the peaceful enterprise of th German empire. Not Again to Be Trusted. “The worst that can happen to the German people Is this, that If they should still, after the war Is over, continue to he obligated to live under ambitious and Intriguing masters in terested to disturb the peace of the world, men or classes of men whom the other peoples of the world could not trust, It might he impossible to admit them to the partnership of nations which must henceforth guarantee the world’s peace. That partnership must be a partnership of peoples, not a mere partnership of governments. It might he Impossible, also, in such untoward circumstances, to admit Germany to the free economic Intercourse which must inevitably spring out of the other partnerships of a real peace. But there would he no aggression in that; and such a situation. Inevitable be cause of distrust, would in the very nature of things sooner or later cure Itself, by processes which would as suredly set in. Wrongs Must Be Righted. “The wrongs, the very deep wrongs, committed in this war will have to he righted. That of course. But they cannot and must not be righted by the commission of similar wrongs against Germany and her allies. “The world will not permit the com mission of similar wrongs ns a means of reparation and settlement. States men must by this time have learned that the opinion of the world Is every where wide awake and fully compre hends the Issues Involved. No repre sentative of any self-governed nation will dare disregard It by attempting any such covenants of selfishness and compromise as were entered Into at the congress of Vienna. The thought of the plain people here and everywhere throughout the world, the people who ; enjoy no privilege and have very sim ple and unsophisticated standards of right and wrong. Is the air all govern ments must henceforth breathe if they would live. It Is in the full disclos ing light of that thought that all poli cies must be conceived and executed in this mid-day hour of the world’s life. People Have No Say. "German rulers have been able to up set the peace of the world only because the German people were not suffered under their tutelage to share the com radeship of the other peoples of the world either in thought or In purpose. They were allowed to have no opinion of their own which might he set up as a rule of conduct for those who exer cised authority over them. But the congress that concludes this war will feel the full strength of the tides that run now In the hearts and consciences of freedom everywhere. Its conclu sions will run with these tides. “All these things have been true from the very beginning of tills stu pendous war; and 1 cannot help think ing that If they had been made plain at the very outset the sympathy and enthusiasm of the Russian people might have been once for all enlisted on the side of the allies, suspicion and distrust swept away, and a real and lasting union of pi' r P effected. Had they believed these things at the very moment of their revolution and had they been confirmed in that belief since, the sad reverses which hate re cently marked the progress of their affairs towards an ordered and stable government of freemen might have been avoided. "The Russian people have been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the German people In the dark, and the poison has been ad ministered by the very same hands. The only possible antidote Is the truth. It cannot he uttered too plainly o’ too often. Freedom of the Ses^. “From every point of view, there fore, It has seemed to he my duty to speak these declarations of purpose, to add these specific Interpretations to what I took the liberty of saying to the senate In January. Our entrance Into the war has not altered our attitude towards the settlement that must come when It Is over. When I said In Janu ary that the nations of the world were entitled not only to free pathways up- Its tiles at the disposal of the general public.

I was thinking, and am thinking now, of Austria herself, among the rest, ns well as of Serbia and of Finland. Justice and equality of rights can be had only at a great price. We are seeking permanent, not temporary, foundations for the pence of the world and must seek this can didly and fearlessly. As always, the right will prove to be expedient. Declare War on Austria. “What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and just to its righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all impediments to success and we must make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a fighting unit. "One very embarrassing obstacle that stands in our way Is that we are at war with Oermany but not with her allies. I. therefore, very earnestly rec ommend that the congress Immediately declare the TTnlted States In a state of war with Austria-Hungary. Does It seem strange to you that this should be the conclusion of the argument I have just addressed to you? It Is not. It Is In fact the inevitable logic of what I have said. Austria-Hungary is for the time being not her own mis tress, but simply the vassal of the German government. We must face the facts as they are and act upon them without sentiment in this stern business. The government of Austria- Hungary Is not acting upon Its own Initiative or in response to the wishes and feelings of Its own peoples, hut ns the instrument of another nation. We must meet Its force with our own and regard the central powers as but one. The war can he successfully conducted In no other way. As to Turkey and Bulgaria. "The same logic would lead also lo a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria, They also are the tools of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand In the direct path of our necessary action. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, hut It seems to me that we should go only where Immediate and practical considerations land us and not heed any others. “The financial and military meas ures which must he adopted will sug gest themselves cs the war and Its un dertakings develop, but I will take the liberty of proposing to you certain o'.ber acts of legislation which seem to rne to be needed for the support of the war and for the release of our whole force and energy. "It will be necessary to extend In certain particulars the legislation of the last session with regard to alien enemies; and also necessary, I be lieve, to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance and departure of all persons into and from the I'nited Stales. "Legislation should he enacted de fining ns a criminal offense every willful violation of the presidential proclama tions relating to alien enemies promul gated under section 40157 of the Re vised Statutes anil providing appropri ate punishments; and women as well as men. should lie Included under the terms of the acts placing restraints upon alien enemies. It is likely that as time goes on many alien enemies will be willing to be fed and housed at the expense of the government In the detention camps, and it would be the purpose of legislation I have sug gested to confine offenders among them In penitentiaries and olher sim ilar Institutions where they could be made to work as other criminals do. Go Further in Fixing Prices. "Recent experience has convinced me that the congress must go further in authorizing the government to set limits to prices. The law of supply and demand, I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the law of unrestrain ed selfishness. While we have elim inated profiteering lu several branches of industry, It still runs Impudently rampant In others. The farmers, for example, complain with a great deal of Justice, that while the regulation of food prices restricts their Incomes, no restraints are placed upon the prices of most of the things they must them selves purchase, and similar Iniquities obtain on all sides. “It Is Imperatively necessary that the consideration of the full use of the water power of the country and also the consideration of the systematic and yet economical development of such of the natural resources of the country as are still under the control of the federal government should he Immediately resumed and affirmatively and constructively dealt with at the earliest possible moment. The press ing need of such legislation Is dally be coming more obvious. A Woid to the Lawmakers.

Concentrate on Winning War. "If I have overlooked anything that ought to he done for the more effective conduct of the war, your own counsels will supply the omission. What I am perfectly clear about Is that In the present session of the congress our whole attention and energy should he concentrated on the vigorous, rapid and successful prosecution of the great task of winning the war. "We can do this with all the greater zeal and enthusiasm because we know that for us this ns a war of high prin ciple. debased by no selfish ambition of conquest or spoliation; because we know, and all the world knows, that we have been forced into It to save the very institutions we live under from corruption and destruction. The pur poses of the central powers strike straight at the very heart of every thing we believe In; their methods of warfare outrage every principle of hu manity and of knightly honor; their Intrigue has corrupted the very thought and spirit of many of our people; iheir sinister and secret diplo macy has sought to take our very ter ritory away from us and disrupt the union of the states. Our safety would be at an end. our honor forever sullied and brought into contempt were we to permit their triumph. They are strik ing at the very existence of democracy and liberty. Cause Is Jost and Holy. ‘‘lt Is because ir is for us a war of high, disinterested purpose, In which all the free peoples of the world are handed together for the vindication of right, a war for the preservation of our nation, and of all that It has held dear of principle and of purpose, that we felt ourselves doubly constrained to purpose for Its outcome only that which Is righteous and of irreproach able intention, for our foes ns well as for our friends. The cause being just and holy, the settlement must he of like motive and quality. For this we can fight, hut for nothing less noble or less worthy of our traditions. For this cause we entered the war and for this cause M ill we buttle until the last gun Is fired. “I have spoken plainly, because this seems to me the time when it Is most necessary to speak plainly, in order that all the world may know that even in the heat and ardor of the struggle and when our whole thought Is of carrying the war through to Its end we have not forgotten any Ideal or principle for which the name of Amer ica has been held in honor among the nations and for which it has been our glory to contend in the great genera tions that went before us. A supreme moment of history has come. The eyes of tiie people have been opened, and they see. The hand of God Is laid upon the nations. He will show them favor, I devoutly believe, only if they rise to the clear heights of his own justice and mercy." The Mystery Explained.

FIRST AID AT SQUAW PEAK Lone School-Teacher on Frontier la Successful in Reducing a Pupil’s Unjointed Wrist. I was eating my lunch In the school house all by myself. And ns I ate, a boy entered and dropped heavily Into a sent, writes Laura Ttlden Kent, In the Atlantic. I looked up Indifferently. The hoy’s face was dyed with red, hut some of the youngsters had been smearing themselves with our new red water colors. This was an unusually suc cessful effort to be hideous, I thought. And then— "l think my wrist is out of joint," said the boy In a steady, controlled tone. I came to life, hut I was still a little skeptical. “Ad* you really hurt, Edward?" I de manded, pushing my lunch basket away. “Yea,” he replied. 1 was on my feet and at his side. The brilliant red that dyed half his face and more was really blood! I bent over him. "How did you do It?" “Fell off my horse. I was taking him down to the river to water him. I don't know—" He was hurt. And I was alone and helpless! "My wrist is out o’ joint 1” he In sisted faintly. “Are you sure?" Hut, oh! I was sure myself as I looked at It! The arm had sprung far out in front of the stiff hand. The bones bulged hideously over it. 1 think I ran out and took a wild look around, but there was nobody In sight hut a crowd of hysterical chil dren pressing up and whimpering. I was no doctor. I only knew that this wrist ought to bo set at once, and I recalled dimly from my own grammar school days a few hints in my old phy siology as to the setting of hones. “Edward, (his ought to be done now!” I said as calmly us 1 could. “I’m not sttre that I can do It—” “Go ahead and try!” recommended Edward grimly. “Hull It out —” I did not give myself time to think. 1 got down beside him, resolutely took the terrible, misshaped wrist Into my hands, and pulled, pressing the hand a little backward at the same time. I felt the hones snap smoothly Into their proper places! I had done what 1 had set out to do! It was unbelievable. Laws of Twelve Tables. The Twelve Tables was the name given to the earliest code of Roman law. According to the ancient ac count, the code originated in this man ner: In the year 402 B. C., a Roman tribune brought forward a proposal to appoint live men to draw up a set of laws with 'the view of limiting the power of the consuls. The aristocracy, always furious, selfish and unwise In their struggles with the common people of Rome, violently resisted this reform and for eight years a tierce warfare was ci, ried on between the two orders, which ended In a sort of partial vhiory for the plebeians. In 454 B. 0. the senate assented to the plan of sending three commissioners to Greece to re port on the laws in force among the different states there. After a lapse of two years they returned and It was then agreed that ten men should he selected to draw tip a code. Accord ing to Livy anil Diodorus, the laws of the Twelve Tables were out on bronze tablets, whence their name, and put up In a public place. Whether these tablets were destroyed by the Gauls when they sacked and burned Rome Is uncert aln. A Pioneer of the Sea. The king’s recent visit to Hurt Glas gow recalls a fact In the history of ships and shipbuilding which has a particular interest at the present time. As everybody knows, observes the Montreal Herald, It was from Port Glasgow that the lirst steamer ever built, the Comet, owner Henry Bell, was launched In 1812. She was a 30- ton vessel with an engine of three horse power, and was found to he so successful that within the next two years two larger cruft were construct ed. One of these was the Marjery, and from the Clyde the Marjery was transferred to the Thames, and plied between London and Gravesend dur ing the first months of 1815. Hut she was viewed with disfavor by the Thames watermen. She was very much of a novelty, and they were sus picious of novelties; besides, they con sidered that this Scotch-built boat In terfered with their rights. So the Marjery left the Thames for the Seine; her owners having sold her to a French company. To reach the Seine she had to cross the channel, and she was thus the lirst steamer to do so. Northern Woods Rations. Men who. In the course of work or pastime, spend much time in winter In the northern wildernesses ol Can uda have practically standurlzed their ration, observes the Mlclilkiiii Senti nel. It consists of one pound of Hour, one pound of bacon, one-third pound of dried fruit and one-third pound of beans per man per day. There are variations, to be sure, but men of ex perience generally place their reliance on this simple menu. None of It la wasted, either. Every scrap of It la eaten. Such a ration, however, would last a city man two days at least. All Should Keep Books. Probably the most expensive error usually made by our farmers Is the failure to keep hooks that will enable them, at any time, to tell whether they are doing business at a protit or loss. Many of our farmers can't tell at the end of the year whether they have made money or lost money. Should .any other business be conducted In this manner, nothing hut failure would be expected.—Exchange. Knew Ho# to Figure.
