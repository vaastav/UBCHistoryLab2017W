PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The great length of the message makes it necesssary that we give only extracts of it ; To the Congress of the United States : I congratulate you upon the favorable aspect of the domestic and foreign affairs of this Government. Our relations with other countries continue to be upon a friendly footing. The recent opening of new lines of telegraphic communications with Central America and Brazil permit ted the interchange of messages of friend ship with the Governments of those coun tries. The fisheries industry, pursued by a numerous class of our citizens on the northern coasts both of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, are worthy the fostering care of congress, whenever brought into competition with the like industries of other countries our fishermen as well as our manufacturers of fishing appliances and preparers of fish products have main tained a foremost place. A question has arisen touching the de portation to the United States from the British Islands by Governmental or mu nicipal aid, of persons unable there to gain a living and equally a burden on the community here. Such of these persons, as well under the pauper class as . defined by the law, have been sent back in ac cordance with the provisions of our stat utes. Her Majesty's Government has in sisted that precautions have been taken before shipment. This has, however, in so many cases proven ineffectual, and es pecially so in certain recent instances of needy emigrants reaching our territory through Canada, that a revision of our legislation upon this subject may be deemed advisable. The legislation of France against the importation of prepared swine products from the United States has been repealed. That lvsult has been due no less to the friendly representations of this Govern ment than to a growing conviction in Fiance that the restriction is not demand ed by any real danger to health. Ger many still prohibits the introduction of all swine products from America. I ex tended to the imperial government a friendly invitation to send experts to the United States to inquire whether the use ot these products was dangerous to health. This invitation was declined. It is understood that measures for the removal of the restrictions which now burden our trade with Cuba and Porto Rico are under consideration by the Spanish Government. The proximity of Cuba and the peculiar methods of admin istration which there prevail necessitate constant discussion and appeal on our part from the proceedings of the insular authorities. I regret to say that the just protests of this Government have not as yet produced satisfactory results. At no time in our national history has there been more manifest need of close and lasting relations with a neighboring state than now exists with respect to Mexico. The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into that country shows by what has already been accomplished that vast reciprocal advantages which must attend the progress of its internal developments. The treaty of commerce and navigation of 1848 has been termi nated by the Mexican Government, and in the absence of conventional engage ments the rights of our citizens in Mex ico now depend upon the domestic stat utes of that Republic. China, by the payment of a money in demnity, has settled certain of the long pending claims of our citizens, and I have strong hopes that the remainder will soon be adjusted. Questions have arisen to using the rights of American and other foreign manufacturers in China under the provisions of treaties, which permit al iens to exercise their industries in that country. On this specific point our own treaty is silent, but under the operation of the most favored nation clause we have like privileges with those of other powers. While it is the duty of the Gov ernment to see that our citizens have the full enjoyment of every benefit secured by treaty, I doubt the expediency of lead ing in a movement to constrain China to admit an interpretation which we have only an indirect treaty right to enact. The transference to China of American capital, for the employment there of Chi nese labor, Avould, in effect, inaugurate a competition for the control of markets now supplied by our home industries. There is good reason to believe that the law restricting the immigration of Chi nese has been violated, intentionally or otherwise, by the officials of China upon whom is devolved the duty of certifyiug that the immigrants belong to the except ed classes. Measures have been taken to ascertain the facts incident to this sup posed infraction, and it is believed that the Government of China will co-operate with the United States in securing the faithful observance of the law. In view of the frequency of invitations from foreign governments to participate iu social and scientific congresses for the discussion of important matters of gener al concern I repeat the suggestion of my last message, that provision be made for the exercise of discretionary power by the Executive in appointing delegates to such conventions. Able specialists are ready to serve the national interests in snc.h capacity without personal profit or other compensation than the defrayment of expenses actually incurred, and this a comparatively small annual appropria tion would suffice to meet. I have alluded in my previous message to the injuries and vexatious restrictions suffered by our trade in the Spanish West Indies. Brazil, whose natural outlet for its great national staple, coffee, is iu and through the United States, im poses to it a heavy export duty upon that product. Our petroleum exports are hampered in Turkey and in other eastern ports by restrictions as to storage and by onerous taxation. For these mischiefs adequate relief is not always afforded by reciprocity treaties, like that with Hawaii, or that lately negotiated with Mexico, and now awaiting the action of the Senate. Is it not advisible to pro vide some measures of equitable retalia tion iu our relations with Governments which discriminate against our own? If, for example, the Executive were empow ered to apply to Spanish vessels and car goes from Cuba and Porto Rico the same rules of treatment and scale of penalties for technical faults which are applied to our vessels and cargoes in the Antilles, a resort to that course might not be barren river and harbor improvements and arse nals, $48,911,382.93; for the Naval Estab lishment, including vessels aud improve ments at navy yards, $15,283,437.17; for miscellaneous expenditures, including nublic buildinss, lisht houses and collect ing the revenues, 40,09S,432. 73; for ex penditures on account of District of Col umbia, $3,817,028.48 ; for interest on the public debt, $59,100,131.25; total, $265, 408,137.54; leaving a surplus revenue of $132,879,444.41, which, with an amount drawn from the cash balance in the Treas ury of $1,299,312,.55, making $134,178, 756.96, was applied to the redemption of bonds lor sinking fund, $44,850,700 of fractional currency for the sinking fund, and reduction of national debt. If the revenue for the fiscal year which will end on June 30, 1885, be estimated upon the basis of existing laws, the Secretary is of the opinion that for that year the receipts will exceed by $60,000,000 the ordinary expenditures, including the amount de voted to the sinking fund. Hitherto the surplus, as rapidly as it has accumulated, has been devoted to the reduction of the national debt. As a result the only bonds now outstanding which are redeemable at the pleasure of the Government are the 3 per cents., amounting , to about 305, 000,000. The four and one-half per cents, amounting to $250,009,000, and the $737, 000,000 four per cents are not payable un til 1891 and 1907, respectively. If the surplus shall hereafter be as large as the Treasury estimates now indicate, the three per cent, bonds may all be redeemed at least four years before any of the four and one-half per cents, can be called in. The latter, at the same rate of accumula tion of surplus, can be paid at maturity, and the moneys requisite for the redemp tion of the four per cents will be in the Treasury many years before those obliga tions become payable. There are cogent reasons, however, why the national indebtedness should not be thus rapidly extinguished. Chief among them is the fact that only by excessive taxation is such rapidity attainable. In a communication to the congress at its last session I recommended that all ex cise taxes be abolished except those relat ing to distilled spirits and that substan tial reductions also be made in the reven ues from cusions. In the interval which must elapse before the effects of the act of March 3, 1883, can be definitely ascer tained a portion at least of the surplus revenue may be wisely applied to the long neglected duty of rehabilitating our navy and providing coast defences for the pro tection of our harbors. This is a matter to which I shall again advert. Immediately associated with the finan cial subject just discussed is the import ant question, What legislation is needed regarding the national currency? The ag gregate amount of bonds now on deposit in the treasury to support the national bank circulation is about $350,000,000. Nearly $200,000,000 of this amount con sists of three per cents, which, as already stated, are payable at the pleasure of the Government and are likely to be called in within less than four years, unless mean time the surplus revenues shall be dimin- .ished. The probable effect of such an extensive retirement of the securities which are the basis of the national bank circulation would be such a contraction of the volume of the currency as to pro duce grave commercial embarrassments. How can the danger be obviated? The most effectual plan, and one whose adoption at the earliest practicable opportunity I shall heartily approve, has already been indicated. If the revenues of the next four years shall be kept substantially commensurate with the expenses, the volume of circulation will not be likely to suffer any material dieturbance ; but if, on the other hand, there shall be great hoped that serious outbreaks will not again occur, and that the Indian tribes which have lor so many years disturbed the West will hereafter remain in peaceful submission. I again call your attention to the pres ent condition of onr extended seacoast, upon which are so many large cities whose wealth and importance to the country would, in time of war, invite attack from modern-armored ships, against which our existing defensive works could give no adequate protection. The Secretary of the Navy reports' that under the authority of the acts of August 5, 1882, and March 3, 1883, the work of strengthening our navy by the construc tion of modern vessels has been auspi ciously begun. Three cruisers are in pro cess of construction, the Chicago, of 4500 tons displacement, and the Boston and Atlanta, each of 2500 tons. They are to be built of steel with the tensile strength and ductility prescribed by law, and in combination of speed endurance and arm ament are expected to compare favorably with the best unarmored war vessels of other nations. A fourth vessel, the Dol phin, is to be constructed of similar ma terial, and it is intended to serve as a fleet dispatch boat. The double-turreted mon itors Puritan, Amphitrite and Terror have been launched on the Delaware River, and a contract has been made for the supply of their machinery. A similar monitor, the Monadnock, has been launched in Cal ifornia. The Naval Advisory Board and the Secretary recommend the completion of the monitors, the construction of four gunboats, and also of three additional steel vessels like the Chicago, Boston and Dolphin as an important measure of ma terial defence. The Utah commissid"n has submitted to the secretary of the interior its second annual report. As a result of its labors in supervising the recent election in that territory, pursuant to the act of March 22, 1882, it appears that the persons by that act disqualified, to the number of about 12,000, were excluded from the polls. This fact, however, affords little cause for congratulation, and I fear that it is far from indicating any real and sub stantial progress toward the exterpation of polygamy. All of the members of the legislature are Mormons. There is grave reason to believe that they are iu sympa thy with the practices that this govern ment is seeking to suppress, and that its effort in that regard will be more likely to encounter their opposition than to re ceive their encouragement and support. Even if this view should happily be erro neous, the law under which the commis sioners have been acting should be made more effective by the incorporation of some such stringent measures as they recommend, as were included in bill No. 2,238 on the calendar of the seuate at its last session. I am convinced, however, that polygamy has become so strongly in trenched in the territory of Utah that it is profitless to attack it with any but the stoutest weapons which constitutional legislation can fashion. I favor, there fore, the repeal of the act upon which the act relating to now, I trust, commend' itself to the wisdom of congress shall provide agaiust its recurrence. The senate -at its last session, after full consideration, passed an this subject, which will ap proval of both houses of congress. For the reasons fully stated in my last annual message I repeat my recommenda tion that congress propose an amendment to that provision of the Constitution which prescribes the formalities for the enactment of laws, whereby, iu respect to bills for the appropriation of public moneys, the Executive may be enabled, while giving his approval to particular items, to interpose his veto as to such oth ers as do not commend themselves to his judgment. The fourteenth amendment of the Con stitution confers the rights of citizenship upon all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the ju risdiction thereof. It was the special purpose of this amendment to insure to members of the colored race the full en joyment of civil and political rights. Certain statutory provisions intended to secure the enforcement of those rights have been recently declared unconstitu tional by the supreme court. Any legis lation whereby congress may lawfully supplement the guarantees which the Constitution affords for the equal enjoy ment by all the citizens of the United States of every right, privilege and im munity of citizenship, will receive my un hesitating approval.

The report of the Secretary of the Treas ury gives a full and interesting exhibit of the financial condition of the country. It shows that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30. 1883, amounted to $398,287,581.95, where of there was received from customs $214, 706,496.93; from internal revenue $144, 720,368.98. For the same period the or dinary expenditures were: for civil ex penses, $22,343,285.76; for foreign inter course, $2,419,275.24; for Indians, $7,- 362,590.34; for pensions, $66,012,573.64; for the Military Establishment, including delay in reducing taxation, it will become necessary either to substitute some other form of currency in place of the national bank notes or to make important changes in the laws by which their circulation is uoav controlled. In my judgment, the lat ter course is far preferable. I commend to your attention the very interesting and thoughtful suggestions upon this subject which appear in the secretary's report. The objections which he urges against the acceptance of any other secusities than the obligations of the Government itself as a foundation for national bank circula tion seem to me insuperable. For avert ing the threatened contraction two courses have been suggested, either of which io probably feasible : One is the issuance of new bonds having many years to run, bearing a low rate of interest and ex changeable upon specified terms for these now outstanding. The other course, which commends itself to my own judg ment as the better, is the enactment of a law repealing the tax on circulation and permitting the banks to issue notes for an amount equal to ninety per cent of the market value, instead of, as now, the face value of their deposited bonds. I agree with the secretary in belief that the adop tion of this nlan would afford the neces sary relief. The trade dollar was coined for the pur pose of traffic in countries where silver passed at its value as ascertained by its weight and fineness. It never had a legal tender quality. Large numbers of these coins entered however into the volume of our currency. By common consent their circulation in domestic trade has now ceased aud they have thus become a dis turbing element. They should not be long er permitted to embarrass our currency system. I recommend provision for their reception by the Treasury and the mints as bullion at a small percentage above the current market price of silver of like fineness. The postmaster-general devotes much of his report to the consideration, in its various aspects, of the relations of the Government to the telegraph. Such re flection as I have been able to give to the snbject since my last annual message has not led me to change the view which I there expressed in dissenting from the recommendation of the then postmaster general that the government assume the same control over the telegraph which it has always exercised over the mail. Ad mitting that its authority in the premises is as ample as has ever been claimed for it, it would not, in my judgment, be a wise use of that authority to purchase or assume the control of existing telegraph lines, or to construct others with a view of entering into general competition with private enterprise. The objections which may be justly urged against either of these projects, and indeed against any system which would require an enormous increase in the civil service list, do not, however, apply to some of the plans which have lately provoked public com ment and discussion. It has been claim ed, for example, that congress might wisely authorize the postmaster-general to contract with some private persons or corporation for the transmission of the message at specified rates and under gov ernment supervision. Various other schemes of the same general nature, but widely differing in their special charact eristics, have been suggested in the pub lic prints, and the arguments by which they have been supported and opposed have doubtless attracted your attention. It is likely that the whole subject will be considered by you at the present session. From the report of the Secretary of War it vjill be seen that in only a single in stance has there been any disturbance of the quiet condition of our Indian tribes a raid from Mexico into Arizona by a small party of Indians which was pursued by General Crook into the mountain regions from which it had come. It is confidently existing government depends, the as sumption by the national legislature of the entire political control of the territo ry, and the establishment of a commis sion with such powers and duties as shall be delegated to it by law. I trust that congress will not fail at its present session to put Alaska under the protection of law. Its people have re peatedly remonstrated against our ne glect to afford them the maintenance and protection expressly guaranteed by the terms of the treaty whereby that territo ry was ceded to the United States. For sixteen years they have pleaded in vain for that which they should have received without the asking. They have no law for the collection of debts, the suppport of education, the conveyance of property, the administration of estates, or the en forcement of contracts. None, indeed, for the punishment of criminals, except such as offend against certain customs, commerce and navigation acts. The re sources of Alaska, especially in fur, mines and lumber, are considerable in ex tent and capable of large development, wThile its geographical situation is one of political and commercial importance. The promptings of interest, therefore, as well as considerations of honor and good faith, demand the immediate establish ment of civil government in that ter ritory. Complaints have lately been numerous and urgent that certain corporations, con trolling in whole or in part the facilities for the inter-state carriage of persons and merchandise over the great railroads of the country, have resorted in their deal ings with the public to divers measures unjust and oppressive in their character. In some instances the state governments have attacked and suppressed these evils, but in others they have been unable to afford adequate relief because of the ju risdictional limitations which are im posed upon them by the Federal Consti tution. The question how far the na tional Government may lawfully intefere in the premises, and what, if any, super vision or control it ought to exercise, is one which merits your crreful considera tion. While we cannot fail to recognize the importance of the vast railway sys tems of the country, and their great and beneficial influences upon the develop ment of our material wealth, we should, on the other hand, remember that no in dividual and no corporation ought to be invested with absolute power over the in terest of any other citizens or class of citizens. The right of these railway cor porations to a fair and profitable return upon their investments and to reasonable freedom in their regulations must be rec ognized. But it seems only just that, so far as its constitutional authority will permit, congress should protect the peo ple at large in their inter-state traffic against acts of injustice which the state 

OBBESFONDEKCE OF THE MON1TOE.J Washington, December 4. The long struggle over the speak ership was ended at the caucus meet ing held iu the House of Representa tives on Saturday evening. Up to within a few hours of this time there was little positive information as to which candidate had the largest num ber of pledges. But in the course of the day the Carlisle men mustered their forces, counted their votes and speedily let it be known that victory was with their banners. The workers for Randall and Cox soon found this out, and as is usual there was a rush to the successful man. "When the meeting was called to order by Gen eral Rosecrans there was hardly a voter to be found who had been any thing but an original Carlisle nian, and sure of his election from the first. Nothing succeeds like success. Mr. Randall and Mr. Cox took their de feat with such equanamity as could be preserved. The latter was re minded of a little story and was quite as good natured and happy over it as if he had secured the prize himself. In fact his candidature ha all along been considered a good joke in its way, serving a useful purpose too, for those who wanted to see which way the cat would jump, before in dulging in that exercise themselves. By keeping on Cox's side they are able to go over to the successful candidate with the plea that they were really for him all the time but were pledged to a complimentary support of Cox. I really think that Mr. Randall w as deeply disappointed and disgusted. He must have been, for the speakership for him opened an outlook in the direction of the presiden cy. With its loss, and especially when lost under the conviction that he was the best man for the democrats to have selected, he felt all the chagrin of a personal disappointment, and the disgust attending a party mistake. But he put a good face on it. He accepted the condolence of his devot ed followers with a smile, and an un moved nerve, and readily joined in the proposition to make the nomina tion unanimous. The democratic leaders have thus set an example of personal courtesy towards each other which presages well for the amenities, during the stormy session which will surely ensue. It is to be hoped that both parties will follow the good be-

The commissioners who were appointed under the act of Januarv 16. lbi6, en titled "An act to regulate and improve the civil service of the United States," en tered DroniDtlv udou the discharge of their duties. A series of rules, framed in accordance with the spirit of the statute, was approved and promulgated by the president. In some particulars wherein they seemed defective, those rules were subsequently amended. It will be per ceived that they discountenance any polit ical or religious tests for admission to those offices of the public to which the statutes relate. The act is limited in its original application to the classified clerkships in the several executive de partments at Washington (numbering about 5,600), and to similar positions in customs districts and post-offices where as many as fifty persons are employed. I am persuaded that its effects have thus far proved beneficial. Its practical meth ods appear to be adequate for the ends proposed, and there have been no serious difficulties in carrying them into effcet. Since the 16th of July last no person, so far os I am aware, has been appointed to the public service, in the classified por tions thereof, at any of the departments or at any of the post-offices and customs districts above named except those cer tified bv the commission to be the most competent on the basis of the examina tions held in conformity to the rules. At the time when the present Execu tive entered upon his office, his death, re moval, resignation or inability to dis charge his duties would have left the Gov ernment without a constitutional head. It is possible, of course, that a similar i contingency may again arise, unless the ginning thus made. On Monday at precisely 12 o'clock the first session of the 48th congress began. The occasion was a brilliant one, as early as 9 o'clock the galler ies in the House began to fill-up, and by eleven there was not a vacant seat to be seen. A sea of faces, and the hum of conversation was all that the late comer could see or hear by climb ing up and stretching his neck to get a glimpse of the inside of the House The halls outside were soon after literally packed with people who were hooeless of getting inside, but who 4. C ' were loth to leave the vicinity where so much excitement prevailed. There was a more quiet aud subdued air about the Senate chamber and gal leries, but they were equally crowded The Senators came in one by one and exchanged greetings with great cor diality. Senator Edmunds who is as taciturn and unemotional as usual, was the especial center of interest, occasioned partly by the doubt as to whether he would preside. Senators Logan, Beck, Anthony, Allison, Har rison, Brown of Ga., Ingalls, and all the old favorites as the programmes -I T j 1 TT say, were on nana. in uie nouse there was a revelation. The habitue of the reporters gallery looked down on an army of strange faces. This was not so peculiar in itself but it was singular indeed to miss so many well-known republicans and to notice how the democratic side of the cham ber was densely populated, while the republican side looked as if it had re cently come through a cyclone. But at precisely twelve the eager audience were hushed to silence by the rapping of the speaker's gavel. Then, escort ed on the one side by his democratic predecessor and late opponent Mr. Randall, and the other by the late speaker Mr. Keifer, Mr. Carlisle walked gracefully up the main aisle and took the speaker's place.
