BUDGET SYSTEM FOR NATIONAL FINANCES Readjustment of the Tariff System, if Necessary, to Meet Changed World Conditions Recognition and Relief for Veteran Soldiers of World War Recommended. Washington, D. C, Dec. 2. General recommendations on legislation to com bat the cost of living, labor unrest, rad icalism and a readjustment of the na tion to peace-time basis were the fea tures of President Wilson's annual message to Congress delivered to-day. The peace treaty, the president told Congress, will be discussed in a sep- nrata message later, as will the railroad question. For the second time only since the president established the practice of addressing Congress in person, his mes sage was read to-day by the clerks. The president's principal recommen dations were: , Establishment of a budget system for the national finances. Reorganization of the taxation sys tem with simplification of the income and excess profits. Readjustment of the tariff system, if ):eeessary to meet changed world con ditions and make the system conform with the fact that the United States is "the greatest capitalist in the world." Recognition and relief for veteran soldiers of the world war, particularly in the way of government farms as proposed by Secretary Lane. Proper measures to foster the Jye KtulTs industry built up during the war to keep the United States independent of foreign supply. An enlarged program for rural devel opment in recognition of the farmers' part in the war. Measures which "will remove the causes" of "political restlessness in our body politic." At this point the president made hia most direct reference to the peace treaty by saying the causes for the unrest "are superficial rather than deep seated," and that they "arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our government to arrive speed ily at a just and permanent peace, per mitting return to normal conditions, from the transfusion of radical theories from seething European centers pend ing such delay, from heartless profiteer ing resulting from the increase of the cost of living and lastly from the ma chinations of passionate and malevo lent agitators. With the return to normal conditions, this unrest will rap idly disappear." The president renewed his recom mendation for legislation to deal effec tively with "those persons who by vio lent methods would abrogate our lime tested institutions." i Several recommendations, some re newals of previous ones, were made by the president to bring down the cost of living. Among them were extension of the food control law to peace-times for the emergency, regulations for trans portation of foods in interstate com merce; a cold storage law modelled 8ft,er the law in New Jersey; a law re quiring murks to show the length of time foods are kept in storage and a law to secure "competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits by fed eral license of corporations selling food in interstate commerce. A long portion of the message was devoted to a discussion of the condi tion and rights of labor. "A definite program to bring about an improve ment in the conditions of labor" and bring about a genuine democratization of industry" was recommended. "The only way to keep men from Agitating against grievances is to re move the grievances," said the presi dent's message. At another point it de clared that "the seed of revolution is passion." "The establishment of the principles regarding labor laid down in the cove nant of the league of nations," said the message, "offers us the way to indus trial peace and conciliation. No other road lies open to us. . Govern ments must recognize the right of men to bargain collectively for humane ob jects. Labor must no longer be treated as a commodity." "The right of individuals to Btrikc is inviolate," continues the message, "mid ought not to be interfered with by any process of government, but there is a predominant right and that is the right of the government to protect all of its people and to assert its power and ma jesty against the challenge of any class." The president was referring to the eovernment's recent injunction against the coal strike. The message closed with a pointed reference to radicalism and red doc trines, and referred to "Russia to-day with its blood and terror" as a "pain ful object lesson of the power of mi norities." "There are those in l hia country," aid the message, "who threatened di rect action to force their will upon a 

EGISLA TION TO AT LIVING COST, OR UNREST, REDS majority. It makes little dif ference what minority it is; whether capital or labor, or any other class; no sort of privilege will ever be permitted to dominate this country. Orderly processes, the message de clarcd, jwere the only ones by which re lief and reform could be obtained. "Those who would propose any other method of reform are enemies of this country," the message said. " Let those beware who take the shorter road of disorder and revolution." THK MESSAGE. To the Senate and House of Representative! : I sincerely resret that I cannot be present at the opening: of this neion of the Consrresa. I am thus prevented from prcsentina in as direct a way as I could wih the many ques tions that are pressing for solution at this time. Happily, 1 have the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments who have kept in time touch with affairs In their detail and whose thoughtful recommendations I earnestly second. In the matter of the railroads and the re adjustment of their, affaire, (trowing out of federal control, I shall take the liberty at a later day of addressing you. 1 hope that t'onimnss will bring to a con clusion at this session legislation looking to the establishment of a budsret system. That thpre should be one single authority respon sible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made not independently of each other, but with refer ence to one single, comprehensive plan of expenditure, properly related to the nation's income, there can be no doubt I believe the burde-n of preparing the budget must, in the nature of the case, if the wrk is to be prop erly done and responsibility concentrated in stead of divided, rait upon the executive. The budget so prepared should be submitted to and approved tor amended by a single committee of each home of Congrws and no tingle appropriation should be made by the Congress, except such as may have been in cluded in the budjret prepared by the ixecu tive or added by the iwrtirular committee of LCongress charged with the budtjet legisla tion. Anoxnerr anu run. ices iraiwrutui uwpri. of the problem is the ascertainment of the economy and efficiency with which the mon eys appropriated ara expended. Under ex isting law the only audit is for the purpose of ascertaining whether expenditures have been lawfully made within the appropria tion. No one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely, economically and effectively. The auditors should be highly trained of ficial with permanent tenure in the treasury department, free of obligations to, or mo tivcn of consideration for this or any sub sequent administration, and authorized and empowered to examine into and make re port upon the methods employed and the re sults obtained by the executive departments of the government. Their reports should be made to the ConsTess and to the secretary of the treasury. Taxation. I trust that the Congress will give its im mediate consideration to the problem of fu ture taxation. Simplification of the income and profits taxm has become an immediate necessity. These taxes performed indispens able service during the war. They must, however, be simplified, not only to aava the taxpayer inconvenience and expense, but in order thnt his liability may be made certain and definite. With reference to the details of the reve nue law, the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of internal revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amendments necessary or desirable in con nection with the administration of the law recommendations which have my approval and support. It is of the utmoKt importance that in dealing with this matter the present law shculd not be disturbed so far as re gards taxes for the calendar year 1920, pay able In the calendar year 1921. The Con grsrs might well consider whether the high er rates of income and profit taxes can in peace times be effectively productive of rev enue and whether they may. not, on the con trary, be destructive of business activity and productive of waste and inetticiency. There is a Jxint at which in pence times high rates of income and profits taxes dis courage energy, remove the incentive to new enterprise, encourage extravagant expendi tures and produce industrial stagnation with consequent unemployment and other attend ant evils. The problem is not an easy one A funda mental change has taken place with refer ence to the position of America in the world's affairs. The prejudice and passions engendered by decades of controversy be tween two schools of political and economic thought the one believers in protection of Ameriran industries, the other believers in tariff for revenue only must be eubordinat. ed to the single consideration of the public interest in the light of utterly changed con ditions. Hefore the war America was hflav ily the debtor of the rest of the world and the interest payments . she had to make to foreign countries on American securi ties held abroad, the expenditures of Amer ican travelers abroad and the ocean freight charges she had to pay to others, about bal ance's the value of her pro-war favorable balance of trade. During the war America's exports have been greatly stimulated and in creastd prices have increased their value. On the other hand, she has purchased a large proportion of the American cecuritips held abroad, has loaned some $9,000,000,000 to foreign governments and has built her own tOiips. Our favorable balance of trade has thus been greatly increased, and Europe has been deprived of the means of meeting it hcrefore existing. Europe can have only three ways of meeting the favorable balance of trade in peace tini', by imports into this country of gold or of goods, or by estab lishing new credits. Europe is in no posi tion at the present time to Bhip gold to us nor could we contemplate large further im ports of gold into this country without con cern. The timet has nearly passed for Inter national governmental loans, and it will take time to develop in this country a market for foreign securities. Another thing here tofore which would tend to prevent foreign countries from settling for our exports by shipments of goods into this country could only have the effect of preventing them from imying for our exports and therefore of preventing the exports from being made. The productivity of the country greatly stim ulated by the war must find an outlet by exports to foreign countries and any meas ures taken to prevent imports will inevitably curtail exports, force curtailment ef produc tion, loud the hanking machinery of the country with credits to carry unsold prod ucts and produce industrial stagnation and unemployment. If we want to nelU we must be prepared to buy. Whatever, therefore, may have been our views during the period of growth of American business concerning tariff Legislation, we must now adjust our own economic life to a changed condition growing out of the fact that American busi ness is full grown and that America is the greatest capitalist in the world. No Policy of Isolation No policy of isolation will fatisfy the .grow ing needs and opportunities of America. The provincial standards and policies of the past, which have held American business ns if in a straightjackct, must yield and give way to the needs and exigencies of the new day n which we live, a day full of hope and promise for American business if we will but take advantage of the opportunities that are ours for the asking. The recent war has ended our isolation and thrown upon tis n great duty and responsibility. The United States must share the expanding world mar kets. The United States desires itself only equal opportunity with the other nations of the world and that through the process of friendly co-operat ion and fair compeition, the legitimate intercuts of the nations con cerned may be successfully and equitably adjusted. There are other matters of importance upon which I urged action at the last ses sion of Congreae which are still pressing for solution. I am sure it is not necessary for me again to remind you that there is one immediate and very practicable question re sulting from the war which we should meet in the mMt liberal spirit. It is a matter of recognition and relief to our soldiers. I can do no better than to quote, from my last message urging this very action. "We must see to it that our returning sol- (Continued on eighth page.)

Frick, Steel Mag nate, Died at His New York Home WAS LONG AGO SHOT BY BERKMAN His Life Forms Wonderful Chapter in Big Finance New York, Doc. 2. Henry C. Frick, millionaire steel manufacturer, died here this morning. Mr. Frick suffered an attack of pto maine poisoning early in November. He had iiearjy recovered from thin when serious complications developed. He was HO years old. Although little known in the finan cial district, Mr. Frick became a prom inent figure in Wrall street on the or ganization of the United States Steel corporation in 1001. He was director and a member of the executive commit tee of that organization almost from its inception. According to general be lief among financial men, he wielded a greater influence titan any other man in directing the polity of that corpor ation. Financiers familiar with Mr. Frick 's interest estimated to-day that his fortune was not less than $200,000, 000. It was t,aid he was one of the very largest individual holders of Lib erty and Victory bonds. The career of Henry Clay Frick has formed one of the most fascinating chapters in the romance of industry in the tinted State. At 10, a bov on a farm, in a family of only ordinary means, he was, at 80, a man of so many millions that his fortune, like those of Carnegie and Rockefeller, waa largely a matter of guesswork, even to hinnwdf. It has been said that he wis worth more than $100,000,000, perhaps a much as $200,000,000. Mr. Frick built up the greatest coke business in the world, and acquired such vast interests in steel that he was also one of the principal magnates in tliat industry, and in rounding out hia career he became known as one of the world's greatest collectors of master paintings. Mr. Frick was born Dec. 10, 1S-19, at West Overton. Pa. This village was named after the maternal grandfather of M. Frick, Abrain Overholt, whose original name was Oberjioltwr and who settled in western Pennsylvania when that region was regarded a the fron tier of civilization. As the settlements along the Allcglieny and Mnnongahcla grew, and Pittsburgh emerged from its swaddling clothes, Mr. Overholt Wame the leading miller and distiller of west ern Pennsylvania. His daughter, Eliz abeth, married John W. Frick, a young man of Swiss ancestry, who at that time was working as an engineer in the Overholt distillery. It was from this, union that the future capitalist was born. The father attempted farming, but did not make a remarkable success of it, and as a result young Henry (lay Frick was practically adopted into the Overholt family when be was about 12 years old. He received a good basic schooling, but there was nothing in his boyhood to indicate the remarkable ability which characterized his later lift', except his eagerness to get into business. For a time he was bookkeeper in his grandfather's distillery, and from this position, he went into Morgan. A Co., coke dealers, and at about 21 years of age he appeared in Pittsburgh as their agent. The coke industry was in its infancy. The iron masters of Pitts burgh were just beginning to appreci ate the value of coke for their furnaces. Young Frick had an opportunity to ac quire a limited interest in a plant near Broad ford, and out of the profits of this he acquired other holdings. He later joined a company to lmild a rail road to penetrate the Connelsville coke region, and in 1ST 1 , the year the road was opened, Mr. Frick organized the corporation of Frick & Co., which bought coat land and coke ovens in the Connelsville region. That was the basis of the Frick fortune In the midst of this period there came the panic of '7.1 and the financial crash of many ambitious operators. At a sheriff's sale, Mr. Frick purchased additional tracts of coal land and ovens and a few years later the Mellons; ow erful Pittsburgh bankers, became inter ested in the expanding enterprise of the young oerator. The Carnegies, then developing their great steel business in Pittsburgh, had taken largo holdings in the Frick Coke company, and in 1SS2 Mr. F'rick found the Carnegie brothers willing to admit him as a member of their firm in con sideration of his giving them further interests in his coke business. It was thus Mr. Frick became also a great manufacturer of steel. Through the Homestead strike of 1802, Mr. Frick came into national prominence. Differences had arisen be tween the Carnegie Steel company and its employes over a wage scale, culmi natingna strike involving thousands of men; the calling yit of the National Guard and the proclamation of martial law. It was at this period, July 22, 1802, that Alexander l'.erkman, a New York anarchist, tried to assassinate Mr. Frick. Bcrknian walked into Frick 's office, drew a revolver and fired, the bullet lodging in Mr. Frick's neck. Mr. Frick was shot a second time and then he grappled with Berkman. During the encounter Mr. Frick was stabbed three times, but he downed his assailant and, held him until the police arrived. Berty man was tried and sent to the western penitentiary in Pittsburgh for 21 years. Mr. Frick maintained a beautiful summer home at Prides Crossing, Mass. He was one of the largest owners of Pennsylvania railroad stock, was one of that company's directors, and its dominating factor. He was also a pow er in Reading, Baltimore & Ohio; Nor folk & Western, and other railroads. On Dec. l.'i, 1881, Mr. Frick was mar ried to Miss Ada Howard Childs of Pittsburgh. Four children were born to them ; two boys and two girls. Mrs. Frick, one son and one daughter sur- ive. HALF BILLION GAIN IN U. S. RECEIPTS During the Fiscal Year 1919 Over the Previous Year, U. S.

The third confer ence of national associations for the league of nations met here to-day, 18 countries being represented. Baron Dcschamps, Belgian member of the Hague court of arbitration, who acted as chairman, expressed the hope in his opening address that "notwithstanding the confuted situation in the United States, that nation, which rendered im mense services to civilization during the course of the war, would help con solidate the idea of the league." Guglielmo Ferrero, Italian delegate, said in a pessimistic speech, that Italy's troubles were due to "vacillation and dilatory tactics by the peace confer ence." . "Time is pressing," he said, "two thirds of Kurope is ablaze or threat ening to take fire." Leon Bourgeois of France regretted the absence of American representa tives and said he confidently hoped "soon to s(e America's adhesion to the league.'.'

Gfff COUNCIL LACKED QUORUM First Time That Has Hap pened in a Score of Years, It Is Said MATTERS DISCUSSED ONLY INFORMALLY Traction Co.'s Desire for Revised Franchise Chief Subject Taken Up For the first time in a score of years, so it is said, the Barre city government failed to muster a quorum last night in a regular meeting, so there was only an informal meeting of the city council with Mayor Glysson and Aldermen Scott, Loranger and Keefe in attend ance; but, although the meeting was slirnly attended, there was a great deal of talk for more than two hours, the matter of the proposed change in' the street railroad franchise being upper most through a visitation from officials of the Barre & Montpelier Traction & Power Co. There was no quorum of the council in spite of the fact that a majority were present, because the rules of the board of aldermen govern the city council, and the rules of the board of aldermen say that four aldermen must be present. Three of the six aldermen were out of town, Alderman Healy be ing in the. middle west on a business trip, Alderman Alexander being en gaged in revising the granite cutters' constitution at Quincy, Mass., and Al derman McMillan being out with his trusty rifle in quest of the elusive deer. ...Messrs. F. E. Gleason, C. J. Cookson and E. A. Harris of the traction com pany appeared . before the informal meeting of the four members of the council and explained the action taken by the Montpelier city council last week relative to a proposed change of the franchise of the company, that ac tion having already been reported in the columns of this paper and being to the cfOct that a straight fare of 18 cents between Barre and Montpelier and the schedule for 45-minute service be permitted, while the matter of a one-man car should go to the public service commission. It seemed to be the sense of the Barre council last night that a straight fare of 18 cents and an hourly schedule be tried out, with a five-cent fare in side the city limits and more frequent service inside the city. As that plan is somewhat at variance with the propos als of the Montpelier city council, it was decided; to request the Montpelier city council to meet the Barre council in the Barre city hall next Monday evening, with the selectmen of Berlin invited to the same conference. The representatives of the traction com pany will not be present at the confer ence. Another matter considered inform ally last night was the proposed ex change of deeds between the city and the Barre Theatres, Inc., of small por tions of real estate on the southeaster ly side of Pearl street, the company proposing to deed a strip four feet wide at the front of the lot in exchange for a strip of about the same area directly in the rear and running alongside the present Pavilion building. The deeds would give the city a 20'-foot en trance to Pearl street instead of 16' as at present, and would narrow the street about midway to Summer street to 203 feet, leaving the Summer street entrance at 32 feet. The present brick building on the front -of tin1 Barre Theatres, Inc., lot would project slightly on the city's newly .acquired land, which would ne cessitate a lease a;; long as the present building stands. C. If. Wishart. who appeared for the company, stated that the company proposed to limit the lease to live years and added that some changes to the front building would probably be made before the expiration of such a period, while a new theatre in the rear would very likely be erect ed in a still shorter time, perhaps as early as next spring. The council had already voted to make the exchange, so that nothing remains now but the pass ing of the deeds and the drawing up of the lease.
