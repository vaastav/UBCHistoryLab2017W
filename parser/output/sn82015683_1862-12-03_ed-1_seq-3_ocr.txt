A shocking accident occurre1on Monday afternoon to a freight train on the Terrc II aute Rdlnuid, lesulting in th de.tli if two men an. 1 the com plete destruction of seventeen cars and their con tents. The train was crossing bridge at Carters burg. The engine and tender and one car had gotover, when the bridge g"ve way and seven teen cars were precipitated into tne bed of the strewn below, and piled in a confused mass. Two or thre of the cars were loaded with horses for the urmv and the others with miscellaneous freight. Strange, but only two of the horses in each ear were killed outright. One of the brake men was terriblr mantled, ami a soldier on the train was killed by a timter from the broken bridge striking him on the head.

The?peech of IIn. T. A. Hendricks. Ia.-t night, bet'ue the Democratic Club, was a ntaterlv review of the policy ot the Administration, as judged from their papers ami prod im ations, and his denuiici ations uf it wild chenei were receive! with great applause by the audience. Mr. Hendricks took the abstract of the President' message and commented upon it, showing the dangers to which the country and the Constitution was expose! .hould the attempt be made to carry out the radi cal measures recommended by the Kxecutive. He still hoped thete was virtue nough in Con gress to check this ultraism, but if theie was not in the present Congress. t!tcre would be in the next Alien the Democrats could get a lick at them. The amendments recommended by the Presi dent to the Constitution, if adopted, would for ever separate the States. The Democratic paity were in favor of the Union the old llig. without i st ir blotted out, and the old Constitution a it is. I hey wouM h ive that. Mr Hendricks commented on the closing para graph of the message, nt d pointed out whit tie conceited to be it meaning. "The dogmas ol the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy pres ent." mu-t, in its connection, mean that we should forget the teachings of Wa.-hington, II imilton, the Adamses.

AVe mut throw a-ide the Constitution nml disregard till the lessons of the past to give "fieedum to the -lave " No mere skefeh of this ale cet h could do it justice, and c merely allude tonne or two points that seemed to trike the audience with j eculiir forte Mator's CofRT. The eximin ition of Thomas B. Anthony, of Columbus, Indiana, charged with an aault and htttcry with intent ! kill L:eut. Mason without provocation," w s heard yesterday in the Maj or'n Coui t. The evidence went to hhow that Anthony, under the iiiHuence of liquor, ini?tetl upon entei ing a carriage ei gaeil by Lieut. Ma?on, and in which Mason's uito was heatcil. M isnti kiiockel him ilonn and then got into the carriage and closed the door. Anthony was considerably stunned by the blow and the fall, but leooveied nnd commenced firing at tlu carriage, one bill bretking the window. He was ably defended by Sims A. Col ley, Eq., who dwelt tijn the provocation of ihe blow given by Mssnii, on the fact of the carriage te:ng a public conveyanc e, and on the superior size aud stiei!gti of Mason The Com i held that a hick eni:zed by a gen t!ehTt:i. for t lie time being, a p-jvate convey ance, atid tuiilcr his conti ol for all legal purpose, as much so a his house. That Anthony was in formed that the coach was engaged, and stiil in sist ed upon emering it; and that Captain Mason did not use undue force in getting rid of him. The offense of shooting at the carriage in wliuh was a lady was a flagrant outrage; and he held the defendant in the sum of $500 for his ap pearance at the next teitn of the Circuit Court. Bail was given. The ci-e of Chuich notirel yesterday chaiged with conti licity in the robbery of the Moieof Mr KcMi.ker. was argue! sit gieat length in the afternoon. The Circuit Prosecutor, Mr. Le ithers. an! X B. Taj lor. Iwp. sjoke for the State Mr. Taylr nude a very fine argument, dwelling t length on slight discrepan.es in the tcstimonv of witnesses, and on the fact that the stolen property was found at the dwelling, not the place of busine, of the defendant. It he pur chased the go! for speculation, it was strange that not over $2:10 worth was forthcoming, when it was said he pdd $CGl for them.
