When the navies of all its enemies j are gathered for the grand assault which shall ? forever shatter its hopes.

Lynchburg's Sunday morning fire, which cfcusii'd a loss of $500,000, is believed to have been of incendiary origin. Whether or not ihe torch was lighted by an alien enemy may j never be known. However, it is only one i of a long series of incendiary tires which Vir- j ginia has suffered since war came upon us. j \ redoubling of vigilance on the part of , Slate and municipal authorities seems to be ! needed to tlo away with this Menace to j propr rly.

While little in formation has be n given out as to its discus Jsfons, it may reasonably bo assumed that gSlans were agreed tipon which will he produc tive of far-reaching consequence? in the rtjiture conduct of th< war. Colonel Ji. M. -a: ous^, chairman of tho American mission, is 'i/ot given to extravagance of statement; hence f.he well-chosen words in which he sums up ihe results of the conference are significant nf achievement. "There has been." he says, "co-ordination and a unity of purpose which promise great results for the luture. It is. my deep conviction that by this: unity and by con centrated effort we shall be able to arrive at ?Uu> goal which we have set out to reach." ??Ifere is a clear-cut statement, which, coming Ifrom so intelligent and practical a source, * conveys an Impression of optimism which can "Tiavc no illusory foundation, hut rather gets jjs strength from soundly based confidence In 4?he ability of the allies, with the new ma chinery of control devised so to co-ordinate their resources of military and economic, power as to speedily overcome tho effect of past reverses and apply it with Irresistible force against tbe onemy at all fronts in future offensives. The conference apparently held to the one purposo of planning for war, not pcace. and in Colonol House's optimistic statement of its accomplishments, the allied peoples may take encouragement. A C larion Call to Battle FOll the American peoplo, the President s message to Congress has but one mean ing -it is a clarion call to battle in a sacred cause, livery other utterance is only inci dental to this main thought?"Our present Hiid immediate task is to win the war. and nothing shall turn us aside from it until it is accomplished." This uttorance sounds the very heart of Amorican purpose, and in its voicing the people hear the martial music of their united spirits marching to the conflict for the overthrow of military autocracy mad with the lust of conquest. They do not underestimate the strength of the forces they combat. They are aware that iu entering this war they went up against a tremendous undertaking. They remained out of it as long as their own national self-respect and the safety of the world's free institutions per mitted. When this was no longer possible, thev made their choice with full know ledge of the sacrifices in blood and treasure that it involved. Hnd when that choice was made they dedicated every power and every resource , at their command to the supreme purpose of : winning the war. The President s message emphasizes that J purpose. Words are not wasted in restating , the reasons that Induced us to inter. These I have been made known to the whole world, and they are familiar in every American j household. Thete considerations belong to j the past, and the President only recurs to them to the extent that they assist in keeping j our objectives clearly outlined as we address ourselves to the measures by ..u:ch we mean to attain them. Our immediate object, as the President tells us. is to win the war, and we shall not slacken or suffer ourselves to he diverted until it is won. On this, he rightly assumes, we cr:? united in - and intention. What these objectives are.iand when it shall he deemed that they have been attained to the point that Aincrlca will feel justified in laying aside the sword, the President tells us in these meaningful words: "We shall re gard the war as won only when the German people say to ue. through properly accredited representatives, that they are ready to agree to a settlement based upon justice and the ( reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done. They have done a wrong to Belgium j which must be repaired. They have estab lished a power over other landB and peoples than their own?over the great empire of Austria-Hungary, over hitherto free Balkan states, over Turkey, and within Asia?which must bo relinquished." Briefly, after asking for a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, tl.e President indicates certain legislation which should be j enacted to further the war program and to J make readily available our resources of na tional strength with as little dislocation to our national industries as possible. Virginia Demands Good Roads 

RICHMOND welcomes the American Asso ciation of State Highway Officials. Its welcome is the more cordial because Vir ginia's highway problem is increasingly urgent and a long-suffering people demands a satisfactory solution. With the gathering here of these practical road builders from many Status, almost on the eve of the General Assembly's convening, it iB not too much to hope that at least suggestions may be forth- | coming which will serve as a guide to legis lative action. j Virginia to-day suffers physically and financially from its lack of system and co ordination in road building. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been thrown liter ally into the muclholes and cow paths which, through custom or courtesy, are called roads, and despite the State's wasted expenditures, Virginia remains a black blotch on the road map of the I'nited .States, avoided by tourists whenever possible and execrated by those compelled to fravel over its hodgepodge of highways. The time has long since passed when there could be argument as to the neces sity of good roads and their correlation to a State's prosperity. The only question now is one of ways and means. Virginia is prohibited from issuing bonds i for roads or any other purpose under the con stitutional provision by which the century and Iliddleberger bonds were refunded. Re cently it has been proposed that the counties i and cities be permitted to assume obligations j up to S10.000,000, or whatever may be needed, tho?-e to be cared for as to interest and retired at maturity by the State from its automobile tax collections, which this year {-.mounted to $600,000, and are expected to increase from year to year. It may be argued that this is virtually an evasion of the con stitutional provision, but if this objection can be eliminated, it may prove the solution of the road problem. It is based, however, on tlio assumption that the 100 countieB and twenty-one cities will indorse the plan. Per haps a majority of them will, but in some of them at least it is to be feared that the cam paign of education has not yet advanced suf ficlentl:, and the result would not bring that unanimity of action vitally essential to an adequate system of State roads. There may be found ardent advocates of the toll-gate system. These point to the modern highways in the Valley of Virginia, and urge that when the roads have been paid for they shall thrown open to the free use of the public. This, however, would be generally regarded as a stop backward, and one not necessary in a prosperous Commonwealth. It. Is a sys tem that other States are abandoning. This is the problem that the Legislature will face. It has passed the point where patience is a virtue, and the people are, de manding action. They are not so deeply con cerned about the method by which good roRds shall be built, so long an It Is within reason and in conformity with accepted scientific standards, but they do propose to have tliem, and that as quickly as possible. Berlin is likely to encounter little difficulty in concluding a peace with the Russian Bol sheviki. The trouble will come in making it stick. It look3 like a superfluity to indict Jere miah O'Leary, since he convicted himself long ago. Where there's so much smoke there must be some fuel.

Painted the stretching land On canvas so fair that no work might compare With the stroke of the Master Hand. Liig'lu were the Tilings from Somewhere.

France ban fought valiantly for one ideal,: the ideal upon which that nation and our nation ! is founded-?the right of the citizen to liberty.' Each day as the French army presses the enemy back from the territory so long occupied, the) sacrifices of Franco are proven with greater poignancy. The band of blackened land now 1 given over to desolation is a visual testimony of what the war has meant to France. Hut it is : not only the losses of to-day. but what those i losses mean in the future, that must be reckoned as part of the burden France bears." Thomas Y.

Kach l one of these Intrepid men played a significant ? part in the development of our country?a part which too often passes unnoticed In works of fjeneral history.

PAUL'S CHURCH HOLDS ITS ANNUAL MEETING Work of It* <iarlrtlrn and Organisations In <<raphlcally I>|apl?yrd In Well ArrnnRcd Month*. Gathered in annual meeting last night at S o'clock, the metnbors of St. Paul's Episcopal congregation were filled with enthusiasm ami gruUllca tion over the splendid work that has been accomplished during the pant year and expressed the hope that (hey will l>o ublc to accomplish more dur ing the coming year. The stereotyped manner of presenting 'ho work done during the pasit year by the reading ?.f lengthy reports was done away with, and the reports were made realistic through actual exhibits, made hy the various departments and branches of the church. There were twenty or ganizations represented in the exhibit, and a glance around the room would immediately Inform one of the work that hail been done by each. The booths were placed around the walls, mid were very attractive. There was the mission exhibit, the Ked Cross ex hibit, the Hoy .Scout exhibit, the men 3 Jtiblc class, the charitablo organization, the woman's auxiliary, and many others. A placard told of tho work that had been undertaken and accom plished. Several musical selections were ren dered. Ono little girl was especially good in a recitation on "The American l-'ing." W. Frank Powers. a member of the vestry, briefly outlined the con tribution that tho church had made to the various causes, saying that the members had contributed J 100,000 to the Hod Cross, ?K>,o00 to the war work council of the Army and Navy V. M. A. and many thousands to the Lib erty bonds, Resides those amounts for war relief and other objects Incident to the present crisis, the congregation gave large sums of money to foreign missions and raised J3<>,ono for the general clergy pension fund.

Howie has been appointed chap Iain nf the Medical College of Virginia base hospital unit, and has also been appointed on the general war board of the Episcopal Church in America, .lust when he will leave Is not known, but when he does his work will be car ried on by his assistant, Rev.

To the Kdltor of The Tlmes-Dispatch: Sir.?Permit me to thank jou for tho convincing exposition of the c.tu^e of equal suit rage contained in your editorial In to-uay'a paper, under" the caption. "Hallot Only Effective Weap on." During the eipht years of Its *.t Istence in Virginia, the Equal .Suffrage League of Virginia has labored inces santly to instill into the minds of men and women of Virginia tho truths so forcofully expressed by you. namely, "Tho Integrity of representative go\ >:iiuient is wholly dependent upon the ..mount of Interest citizens display in elections, and without the ballot such Interest amounts to nothing. It (the ballot) uiono is the weapon which the foes of good government fear, and the only weapon which can batter down tlie supports of privileged rule, defiant of the public will. ... A citizen with out the ballot is a citizen in name only. He has no more voice In determining the course of public affairs than a wooden Indian. In so far as his citi zenship rights are the subject of deter mination, they are at the mercy of those who possess tho ballot, whether it be in enlightened, patriotic hands or In the hands of the corrupt and ig norant." Upon these democratic doctrines is founded the claim of women citizen* for a voice iri their government. And surely Tho Times-Dispatch can no lunger give aid and comfort to the foes of democracy who advise women citizens to use Indirect influence and to arouse public sentiment to accom plish reforms, while it so emphatically ar.d candidly declares that "the force of public sentiment can only accom plish effective results through the bal lot." You state: "Half of the potential voters of the city of Richmond, year In and year out, voluntarily disqualify themselves for any voice whatever in the conduct of their own public af fairs." 1 would call >?our attention to th.- fact that while haif of the poten tial voters voluntarily disqualify themselves, half of the citizens of Rich mond are involuntarily and arbitrarily disqualified for any voice In the con duct of their own public affairs, and that in spite of the earnest protest of thousands of these disqualified citi zens. The irony of the situation is that the number of women enrolled in the Equal Suffrage League of Richmond, pleading for a voice in their government, ex ceeds the number of men who mads use of the ballot in tho olectlou in Klclunond on November 6. 1 f"l7.
