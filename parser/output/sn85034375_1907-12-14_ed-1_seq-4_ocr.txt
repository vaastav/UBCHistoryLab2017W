But does Mr. Edison know that many concrete houses are being constructed now, though not in the cast-iron mold which is the distinctive feature of his scheme, and at no such moderate price? There is reason to fear that Mr. Edison can not insure the $1,000 rate. The mysterious earthquake recorded some weeks ago, which could not be located, has found a startling solution. That a mountain should fall, burying hundreds and wiping out an entire population, bears gruesome testimony to the truth of the instruments which recorded a disaster as great if not greater than the one which over whelmed San Francisco.

Unfortunately the Statement That the Tariff Was Responsible for Quieting Financial Flurry Is Not Borne Out by Facts. know It is indeed a pleasure to from such an exalted authority the American Economist, the organ of the tariff-protected trusts, that the panic is over, and it was the high tariff which cured our financial ills. But in spite of this assurance of the Economist there is every day still published new's of this and that fac tory shutting down, or discharging half or more of their workmen, and of Is the tariff as wages being reduced, which protects the trusts working at cross purposes, or is the Economist mistaken in its diagnosis of present conditions? Even the New York pa pers, which have evidently entered into a league for the purpose of mini mizing the panic, do not seem able to swallow the good news that the panic is over, or that the protective tariff saved the day. "We know, of course, that protection brought us all our national blessings," says Evening Post, "and would, if not hin dered now and then by satanic free traders, avert every public ill; but we did not expect to see the truth set forth so bluntly as it is by the Econo mist. 'The tariff.' it says, Siad noth ing whatever to do with bringing on this financial flurry, but it had a tre mendous lot to do with quieting it.' We can easily understand, therefore, that 'faith in protection was never more alive,' since people have seen it cause 'the worst money panic the country has known for 15 years' to 'disappear inside of five days.' Our only regret is that the bankers and trust company presidents and the sec retary of the treasury should have been in ignorance of all this, and should have spent haggard days and nights ever the questions of reserve and gold imports, when all the while there was the tariff fairy godmother making their anxiety needless and fhelr labors superfluous. But we fear that the foolish men would still press one question upon the Economist: Granting that the tariff ended the panic, how did it happen to slip a cog and let the panic occur at all?" There be those that claim that the the tariff has so protected the trusts and monopolists that it has led them to branch out too greatly after the enor mous profits the tariff has protected them in charging, and this kind of bolstered up prosperity has just broken down of its own weight for lack of enough fuel to feed on. Wheth er this view is the correct one, or whether the organ of the trusts is cor rect in its statement that the panic is over, and that "the tariff had noth ing to do with bringing on this finan cial flurry', but it had a tremendous lot to do with quieting it," will soon be seen, and the truth will eventually prevail. The last Republican plat form declared that "a Republican tariff has always been followed by business prosperity," but then that was so notoriously untrue that it should be taken with due allowance as simple partisan boasting, and the boast of the Economist may be like unto it. Time will tell and not very long will be required, either. A Change Imperative. The Republican leaders contend that congress or the courts may just ly put upon the constitution a con struction which shall be considered as the constitution itself, and are un willing that there should be any check to oppose their designs. If they had their way, every construction put upon the constitution by congress or by corporation-owned judges of the inferior federal courts would be in effect a new constitution. Thus our supreme law would be tossed about by every political breeze, until it finally crystallized anew into a system of tyranny based upon arbitrary prac tices dictated by corrupt corporations. President Roosevelt, who is the lead er of the party favoring the alteration of the constitution by this foul meth od, now has congress at his feet, and has appointed 57 federal judges, who presumably adhere to his opinions. If the people desire to preserve their constitution, they must very soon change the administration of the gov ernment. They must change it, in deed, at the next election. Mistakes of Roosevelt. If President Roosevelt is as care less of his financial facts as he is of tbe law on several matters he will hardly go down into history as a safe man to follow. There is no excuse for a president to make misstatements about the laws or the financial affairs of the United States, for he has an army of legal and financial talent to look up the law and the facts, and when he said there was "no legal war rant" for placing on the coins of the United States the ciotto "In God we trust," he had ev'dently never ex amined "the laws of the United States relating to coinage," wherein section five, chapter C expressly provides for the use of the motto. No Need for Coaling Stations. Mexico offers us coaling stations in RQuthern California "in return for similar concessions." Of course, the greater concession we can make to Mexico is permission to go on staying at home and attending strictly to busi ness under *he original Monroe doc trine that American republics attend ing strictly to business will have no used to multiply coaling stations. 

PARTY HAS NOT CHANGED. Republicans Shown to Have No Interv tion of Reforming Abuses. _ ^ ; Senator Lodge of Massachusetts did not define his meaning when he told Massachusetts Republicans recently that the need for revising the Dlngley tariff law would justify an extra ses sion of a Republican congress. This expression, called out by a strong demand from influential Re publican manufacturers in Massa chusetts, is now defined by Congress man James Kennedy, of the eight eenth, or "McKinley," district of Ohio. In a speech at East Liverpool, O, it i* said he "converted the manufacturers of pottery to his way of thinking," which is that the Dingley law is radi cally defective. "Repairs to the Ding ley bill are needed," he said, "and they should be made while the Repub lican party is in power. * * * The most serious defect of the Dingley bill is the administrative clause which bases all ad valorem duties collected on the price at which goods manufactured abroad are sold in the foreign mar ket. This mars seriously the harmony and general efficiency of that great law." As he illustrated his meaning, it shows that a tariff rate of 60 per cent, would mean 60 cents on the dollar of value at the place of manufacture and not on the dollar of price fixed or in tended to be fixed in this country un der the Dingley rates of taxation. Such a change as he proposes, while racking no apparent change in the 60 per cent tax, might easily double the amount of the money charge against the importation of any article promis ing competition with the prices of pro tected combinations. It is in this way that the Republican party purposes to reform Republican abuses. It has never yet passed a tariff bill that did not increase taxation toward the point of trc.de prohibition. It If never likely to do so. Nor under the influences which control it is it ever likely to be able to do so if it wished. is is a A Doctor of Laws. Gov. Johnson of Minnesota, on whom the University of Pennsylvania has conferred the degree of doctor of laws, is one of the best law doctors in this country. He has doctored the laws of Minnesota to such an extent that honest people get their dues and the corporations get their deserts. A first-rate doctor is that Johnson. His diagnosis of national politics is as ac curate and his remedies as appropriate as those which made him famous in local and state politics. He points out the national malady unerringly when he declares that it is threefold; that it consists in allowing special privileges, in the domination of trusts, and above all, in a "conflict of law, which at one and the same time pro hibits the existence of a trust and protects and fosters trust develop meat." This inconsistency is really the root and kernel of the whole na tional malady; and it is reflected in the character of the president him self, who is in principle a free-trader, but in practice a protectionist; in theory an enemy of monopoly, but in practice the instrument and champion of monopolyâ€”a half-and-halr ruan, who, while clamoring for a "square deal," is the most "practical" and the most consummate politician that has risen to eminence since the beginning of the republic. Malefactors of Great Wealth. "This contest is to determine wheth er rich malefactors or the people shall rule." So said President Roosevelt at Provincetown, Mass., August 20,1907. Since then President Roosevelt ap proved the rule of the Wall street leaders, including Rockefeller, in their efforts to stay the panic, and the president's message to congress " draws it mild" on the malefactors of great wealth. From which we may infer that the people's cause has lost out in the contest. Looks Like Graft. Out of the Russian ships she shat tered during her war Japan has recon structed a pretty good secondary navy. Out of the Spanish vessels we smashed off Santiago the United States did not finally secure a single prize. Whethei this means that our smashing abilities left nothing worth saving, or whethei it was to the interest of the corpora tions that build warships to discourage salvage operations, is a question foi naval debate at least. A Topsy-Turvy Scheme. Nothing could better illustrate the topsy-turvy condition of the American currency system than the administra tion's decision to issue $50,000,00d in Panama canal bonds and if necessary $100,000,000 in interest-bearing tificates as a basis for increasing cir culation.â€”N. Y. World. cer Plain Attempt at Deception. The announcement that President Roosevelt finds the coming session of congress "too short for tariff revision" is altogether in line with his general policy of opposing Republican abuses and standing pat for their perpetuation until there is time enough to make them more abusive than ever. It is possible that Mr. Roosevelt may feel the check of an adverse wave of sentiment in his party before he proceeds much further with his as piring program of political domina tion.â€”Washington Herald. Will the Republican party ever be come unanimous for reform of any sort which would guarantee the country that in future all Asiatic wrestling matches, prize fights, cock fights and similar events will be "pulled eff" out side the White House 7 iven for the sort of reform FOR 

GREATER MISSISSIPPI â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ Devoted to the Agricultural, Commercial and Industrial Development of the State's Incomparable Resourcesâ€”OCcial Orjfan of Department of Agriculture and Commerce. BT H 12. BLAKESL12E. JACKSOH. The farmers of Mississippi hold in their possession today a product that is worth approximately sixty ini'lion dollars in English, German or any other kind of gold. Reference is, of course, made to the cotton that is being 1 el J for a fair price. This cotton is being held for fifteen cents per pound, what it is actually worth, so acknowledged by all who are in a position to know the real conditions as they exist. The two powerful organizations, the Farmers' Union and Cotton Association, are be hind the movement and success seems to be theirs, although our people were not sufficiently supplied with warehouses and the necessities of life at home to make the fight they went into. It lias been a great battle, the first of its kind where the cotton planter determined to fix the price on his product, and has been hard fought. Those who had been in the habit for years of saying what the planter should receive for his cotton of course gave up that dictation only when forced to do so. The big banks in New York sent out letters to the smaller banks through out the South, urging them to get the cotton on the market. Theodore Price and other eotton gamblers have tried every means at their command to force the holders to sell. The big wholesale merchants in New Y'ork, St. Louis and other commercial centers have brought to bear all the influence in their power to force the cotton on the market, but in the face of all this the loyal mem bers of the two organizations, as well as many who are not members, stood as firm as a stone wall and held for the price determined upon. This means a great deal to the pepole of Mississippi. It is an agricultural State and will so remain. Then if the planters will get together and co-oper ate with those from other States for a fair price for their product, it will mean millions annually to us. Our present prosperity will lx* only the be ginning of a period beyond the expecta tions of the most optimistic. It means a "Greater Mississippi" in every sense of the word, croakers and sore toes to the contrary notwithstanding. have There is a farmer up in Lafayette county who is well fixed to hold his eot ton an indefinite length of time if neces sary to get the price demanded. Lafayette Comity Press tells the story thus: "A few miles from Oxford lives a quiet, modest young man, who answers to the name of W. M. Rogers. Banks may break, financiers may commit t:i cide, merchants may run over their oc counts with blanched faces, but Rogers is not concerned, save as one man sym pathizes with another who is in dis tress. Listen: On less than three-fourtiis of an acre of land lie raised and sold for money salad $28, turnips $10, pota toes $75. Besides this, which he did mostly for experiment, he raised corn, meat, oats, hay, potatoes and five bales of cotton on his place. On being ques tioned about not being able to get money for bis cotton lie answered with a con tented smile that he didn't have to sell it.
