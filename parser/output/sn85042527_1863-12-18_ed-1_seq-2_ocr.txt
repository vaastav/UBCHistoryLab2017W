Tho President's Me3 j sage was received and read. The following is a synopsis of its leading points : I? tho opening paragraphs the President rapidly reviews the event* of the events of the past year, remarking that whilst our success may not have equalled &ur expectations, wlie havo cheeked the enemy every whoro in bis advance. foreign relations. Our relations with foreign nations are discussed at considerable length. The Pres ident regrets that there has been no improvement. in those relations si<ace his Mob 6age in January last, and that the conduct of European nations is less impartial* and in s?mo cases has assumed "a character pos itively unfriendly. Commissioners were sent abroad for the purpose of entering into negotiations nroner to fir tlm r?tat5?? rights and obligations of tlio Confederate and United States, under the treaties eater od into with foreign nations, prior to the preparations for the separation which has taken place ; but this tender on our' part was declined. Here, as we have been refused the benefit of those treaties, they have ceased to bo binding, and, in the opin ion of the President, our relations with Ku ropean nations arc now enntro'led exclusively by the general rules of the laws of nation?. tiib financeb?taxation. Legislation upon the subject of the finan ccb is earnestly recommended. Although tho magnitude and dura lien of the war was at first anticipated, still, the resources of the country are so ample, and the spirit of the people so devoted to its cause, that relief ?- * 1 1 .... .. uui icwu. jliiu iiuunciai poi icy of the Government since its formation is discusssed ; npd the President contends that, whilst tho provisions of the Permanent Constitution, in reference to direct taxation, cannot be carried into effect, the mode pointed out is plain ; mid that it is the duty ol Congress to execute the general intent of the Constitution, by making the tax uniform throughout the Confeder-' ate States. These considerations are greatly enforced by tho reflection that the attempt to apportion taxes amongst Slates, Rome of which are wholly or partially in occupation of a hostile force, would subvert the whole intention of the framers of ihe Constitution and be productive of the most revolting injustice, instead of that just correlation between taxation and representation, which it was their purpose to secure. With a larce not Lion r?f enmn Slates occupied by the enemy, what jus lice would there be in imposing on tho remainder the whole amount of taxation of the entire State iu proportion to its representation ? What eko would this be, in effect, than to increase the burthen of those who are the heaviest sufferers by the war, and to make our own inability to prot?ct them from ivasion, as we are required to do by the Constitution, b ground for adding to their losses, by an attempted adherence to (be letter, in violation of th^ spirit of that instrument ? No such puiw pose could have been entertained and such result contemplated by the frninerflof the Constitution. It may add weighjvto these considerations, continues the PMsident, if we reflect that, although ihe stitution provided that it should go into operation with a reuresentnfinn distributed among the States, it expressly ordains, alter providing for a census within three years, that this temporary distribution of representative power is to endure until such an enumeration shall be made. Would any one argue that, because the census cannot be made within the fixed period, the Government must, at the e*i piration of that period, perish for want of a representative body ? In any aspect in which the subject can be viewed, I am led to the conclusion already announced, and which is understood to bs in accordance with the vote taken in one or both IIouseB, at the last session. I shall, therefore, until we are able to pursue the precise mode required by the Constitution, deem it ray duty te approve any law levying taxation, which 3'ou are bound to impose Tor the defence of the country, in any other practicable mode, which sball distribute the burthen uniformly and impartially on the whole property of the people. THE 

CURRENCY?FUNDING. In your former legislation you hare caught to avoid an inorease in tbo volume of notes in circulation, by offering inducements for voluntary funding. The measures adopted for that purpose have been but partially successful, aud the evil has reached such a magnitude as to permit no other remedy than a compulsory reduction of the currency "to the amount required by the business of the couptry. This reduction should be accompanied by a pledge that, under no stress of circumssances, will that amount be . exceeded. No possible mode of using the credit pf Government \fcan be so disastrous as one which ^disturbs the basis of all exchanges, renders impossible all calculations of future values, augments, in constantly increasing proportions, tjie prices of all commn/lirtoa >-<' ? T?..?.VU| Qll'i W UOpreciates all fixed wagon, salaries and incomes as to reader them inadequate to barn subsistence. If to these be added tbo still more fatal influence on t^e morals and character o|0he people, to which I have already adverted, I am persuaded you will' concur ia the conclusion that an inflexible adherence to a' limitation to the currency at a fixed sum, is-an indispensable olement of- any system of finance uow to be adopted. Holders c?f currency now outstanding tan only be protected in the recovery of just claims, by substituting for nates some other seourity. If "the ^currency Is not greatly <i*.'

TUB 

ARMY HOW TO FILT, TIIK RANKS. Tlio Prosid?nt believes the army to be in all respects in better condition than at any previous period of tho war. lie recommends the restoration to the army of all who are now improperly absent, putting an end to substitution, modifying the exemption law, restricting details, aud placing in the ranks all able-bodied men now employed as wagoners, nurses, cooks and uuiur employees uoing service lor which negroes may bo found competent. lie concurs in the opinion expressed bj the Secrrtary of War, that there is no grouud (or the objection that a new provision, to include those who furnished substitutes under the former call, would be a broach of contract on the part of tha Government. rOSTAL 

AFFAIRS. The action of the several Executive Departments is reviewed, and the gratifying announcement made that the receipts of the Postvffiuo Department are six hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars in excess of the expenditures. Communication with the Trans-Mississippi region is so ob structed as to render difficult a compliance with the Executive need. Legislation, he adds, is required providing for the exerc'se ......?....... ?- ? I .c.u|iuim j nuiiiiiriiy, especially in uie Postal and Treasury Departments, for which Suh-?SecretarieB are recommended ; while for military* affairs, it would seem to be sufficient to authorize the President and the Secretary of War to delegate to the Commanding Generals, so much of the discretionary power rested in them, by law, as the exigencies of the service shall require. 

CONCLUSION. In conclusion, the President adverts to the sarage ferocity of the enemy in conducting the war, and holds up to public execration the refusal of the LiDOoln Government to execute the cartel for the exchange of prisoners; but the patriotism of th? people had proved e(jual to every sacrifice demanded by their country's need, and God had blessed us with success d sproportionate to our'means, and, under His divine favor, our labors must at last be crowned with success. 111b

Since the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, the rebel borders (? forces) liavo been pressed further back by tho complete opening of the Mississippi, and the country claimed by the rebellion divided into two dislinot parts. Tennessee and Arkansas cleared of insurgents, are now under control of influential citizens, and each has declared openly for the Union. Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion 100,000 are now in Unitod States military service, who are as good soldiers as any. The emancipation measure lias improved the public sentiment abroad. At home it has been fully discussed, sup ported and denounced. It has been highly encouraging to the Administration, looking to the resumption of tho national authority in tho rebel States. In it nothing is attempted but what is justified by the Constitution. He says while he remains in his present position, he shall not attempt to rotract the Emancipation Proclamation, nor to return slavery, <Sco., dcc, Charleston, Dec. 11.?The enemy again shelled tho city at different intervals during the day.

Since thon tbuy have nut boon allowed to ohooso ofiicers, but outsiders have been appointed to command them, who treated them cruelly, and denied thcin privileges usually onjoyed by soldiers.
