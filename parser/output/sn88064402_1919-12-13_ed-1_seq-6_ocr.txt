WILSON'S MESSAGE READ TO CONGRESS LABOR UNREST AND HIGH COST OF LIVING IS DISCUSSED. General Recommendation for Return of the United States To Peace Basis. Washington.-A diversified program to restore a peace time business stat us, revise the tax system, curb un rest, reduce the cost of living and rec tify labor and farming conditions, was recommended by President Wilson Tuesday in his message to the new session of congress. The president asked for new tariff laws based on the nation's changed relation to the rest of the world, sug gested' that the income and: excess profits tax schedules be siinhplified, advocated steps to improve rural con ditions and promote production, and declared for a "genuine democratiza tion of industry" to protect both la bor and capital. The president's principal recommen dations were: Establishment of a budget system for the national finances. Reorganization of the taxation ays tem, with simplification of the income and excess profits. Readjustment of the tariff system, if necessary, to meet changed world, conditions and make the system con form with the fact that the United States is "the greatest capitalist in the world." Recognition and relief for veteran soldiers of the world war, particularly in the way of government farms, as proposed by Secretary Lane. Proper measures to foster the dye stuffs industry built up during the war to keep the United States independent. of foreign supply. An enlarged program for rural de velopment, in recognition of the farm ers' part in the war. Measures which "will remove the causes of political restlessness in our body politic." At this point the president made his most extensive reference to the peace treaty by saying the causes for the unrest "are superficial rather than deep-seated," and that they "arise from or 'are connected with the failure on the part of our government to ar rive speedily at a just and permanent peace, permitting return to normal con ditions, from 'the transfusion of radical theories from seething European cen ters pending such delay froti heartess profiteering, resulting from the in crease of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear. Several recommendatioas, some re newals of pi-evious ones, were mnade by the president to bring down the cost of living. Among them were ex tension of the food control law to peace Stimes for the emergenoy; regulations for transportation of foods in inter state commerce; a coal storage law modeled after the law in New Jersey; a law requiring markets to show the length bf time foods are kept in stor age, and a law to secure "competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits" by federal license of corpora tions selling food in interstate com merce. Clerks Read Messagbe. For the second time only since the president established the practice of adaressing congress in person his mes sage was read today by the clerks. To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: "I sincerely regret that I can not be present at the opening of this session of the congress. I am thus prevented from presenting in as direct a way as I could wish the ma* questions that are pressing for solution at this time. Happily, I have had the advantage of the advice of the heads of several executive departments who have kept in close touch with affairs in their detail, and whose thoughttful recom mendations I earnestly second. "In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs grow nig out of federal control I shall take the liberty of a later date of address ing you. "I hope that congress will bring to a conclauipton, at this session, legisla tion looking to the establishment of a budget system. That there should be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriations, and that appropriations should be made not iniependently of each other, but with reference to one single compre hensive plan of expenditure proper ly related to the nation's tincome, there can be no doubt. I believe the bur den of ,preparing the budge'it nust, in the nature-of the case, if the work s to be'properly done and responsibility concentrated instead of divided, rest upon the executive. The budget so prepared should be submitted to and approved or amended by a single com mittee of each house of congress and no single appropriation sholld be besome Dietanoe.

"I trust that the congress will give its immediate consideration to the problem of future taxation. Simplifi cation of the income and profits taxes has become an immediate necessity. They must. however, be simplified, not only to save the taxpayers inconveni ence and expense, but in order that his liability may be made certain and definite. "With reference to the details of the revenue laws, the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of in ternal revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amend ments necessary or desirable in con nection with the administration of the law recommendations which have my approval and support. "There are other matters of import ance upon which I urged action at the last session of congress which are still pressing for solution. I am sure it is not necessary for me to again remind you that there is one immediate and very practicable solution resulting from the war which we should meet in thb most liberal spirit. It is a mat terof recognition and relief to our soldiers. I can do no better than quote from my last message urging this very action: "We must see to it that our returning soldiers are as sisted in every practicable way to find the places for which they are fitted in the daily work of the country. This can be done by developing and main taining upon an adequate scale the ad mirable organization created by the department of labor for placing men seeking work and it can also be done in at least one very great field by cre ating new opportunities for indiivdual enterprise. "The secretary of the interior has pointed out the way by which return ing soldiers may be helped to find and take up land in the hitherto unde veloped regions of the country which the federal government has already prepared or can readily prepare for cultivation and also on many of the cutover of neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older states; and I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently that his plans shall receive immediate and sub stantial support of congress. "No one who has observed the march of events of the last year can fail to note thle absolute need of a definite program to bring about an improvement in the condition of la bor. There can be no settled condi tions leading to increased production and a reduction in the cost of living if labor and capital are to be antago nistic instead of partners. S und thinking and an honest desire to Isrve the interests of the whole nation as distinguished from the interests of a class must be applied to the solution of this great and pressing problem. The failure of pther nations to consid er this matler in a vigorous way has produced bitterness and jealousies and antagonisms, the food of radicalism. The only way to keep men from agi tating against grievances is to remove the grievances. An unwillingness even today to discuss these matters produces only dissatisfaction and gives comfort to the extreme elements in our country which endeavor to stir up disturbances in order to provoke gov ernments to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression. The seed of revolution ,s repression. The rem edy for these things must not bp nega tive in charaeter. It must i4 con structive, It must comprehend the general interest. The real antidote for the unrest which imanifests itself is not supp'ession but a deep considera tion of the wrongs that beset our na tional life and the application of a remedy. "Congress has already shown its will ingness to deal with these industrial wrongs by establishing the eight-hour day as the standard in every field of labor. It has sought to find a way to prevent'child labor. It has served the whole country by leading the way in developing the means of preserving and safeguarding the lives and health in dangerous industries. It must now help in the dtifficult task of finding a method that will bring about a genu- I ine democratization of industry, based upon the full recognition of the right of those who work in every rank to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affects their welfare. It is with this pur pose in mind tjpt I called a confer ence to meet in Washington on Decem ber 1 to consifer these problems in all their broad aspects, with the idea of bringing about a better understand ing between these two iaterests. "This is the hour of test and trial for America. By her prowess and strength and the indomitable courage of her soldiers she demonstrated her po'wer to vindicate on foreign battle fields her conceptions of liberty and justice. Let not her influence as a mediator between capital and labor be weakened and her own failure to set tle matters of pufely domestic concern be proclaimed to the world. "There are those in this country who threaten direct action to force their wilt upon a majority. "Russia today, with its blood and terror, is a painful object lesson of the power of miborities. • It makes little difference.what minority it is; wheth er capital of labor, or any other class; no sort of privilege will ever be per mitted to dominate this country. We are a partnership or nothing that is worth while. We are a democracy, where the majority are the mast'ers, or all the hopes and purposes of the men who founded this government have been defeated and forgetten. "In America there is but, eae way by which great reforms can be ac complished and the relief sought by classes obtained, and that is through the orderly processes of representative government. Those who would pro pose any other method of reform are enemies of the country. America will not be daunted by threate nor lose her omposure or calmness in these die Tresing times. We can afford in the midst of this day of passion and unrest to be self-contained and sure The in strument of all reform in America is the ballot. The road to economic and social reform in America is the straight read of justice to all classes and conditions, of men. Men have had to follow this read to realize the full fruition of their objects and purposes. Let those beware who would take the shorter read of disa order and revolution. The right road is the road of justice and orderly process. French Prioners I Germany.

RAY 

BAKER (Copyright, 1919, by the McClure News paper Syndicate.) Gary hazard, dramatic critic of the Morning Star. scowled into the cloud ot tobacco smoke for which his long curve-stemalmetd pipe was responsible. "No use," he sighed as he tore a sheet from his typewriter nitl cast it into the waste-basket. "I simply can't make the girl out It good vaude villist. She's wonderful to look at, bLt when they put her on the vaude ville stage they spoiled a fine wife." Ills face took oin i little smile as he sat therieat his desk in the edltor.il room. lie was In a hurry to finish his criticism, or rather the printers were in a hurry to, get it, ;o they could ilotse up the theatrical page. [ut smitehiliw hle just couldn't seemn to go on with his work. All about himi was notie. Type writers vied with telegraph instru nenits in I1 ('Outctst of soundtl, and every now alnd then the linotype' would chip in with their musical tinkhle-tinkle whenever some one opened the douor to the 'ollposintg rooml. The city edituor was roaring into a telephone. repeating for the fifth time the words: "1 didn't get that last name: will you please spell it?" The state editor was howling into an other phone, and the telegraph and news editors were arguing rather loudly over the size of a head for the League of Nations story. In the midst of this apparent con fusion Gary sat at his machine and dreamed about the girl he had seen an hour and a half ago on the Em press vaiudeville stage. Gary did not try to delude himself. He realized he was In love with the girl; had renounced possession of his heart the moment she skipped onto the stage, and the worse her act became as t plrogressed the more deeply Gary became enmeshedlgin her charms. The girl fitted the inental picture of his ideal in features, height, gesture and voice. And yet her act was absolutely impossible. That was why Gary's hands lin gered on the keys of his typewriter. He could not hear to give his honest opinion as to Mildred Harrison's act -"Mildred Harrison in a Whirlwind of Song, Dance' and Merriment." Twice he started to write complimentary words, and once he thought seriously of omitting mention of her in his re view, but quickly changed his mind when he re~lzed the omission would be more noticeable than a few words of adverse criticism. As to the com pliments that he wanted to write, and *hich he knew her act did not de serve--well, he simply couldn't write a lie. He knew, and everybody else at the theater that evening knew. that Mildred Harrison 'was a failure on the vaudeville stage, as was evidenced by the tittering heard during the would-be serious moments gf her program and the forced "haw. haw, haw" when she endeavored to he witty. "How did they ever let her on the stage?" he asked himself. "Surely she must have had a big Idull with the powers that be." WVell, it was inevitable. He was paid money to give his honest opinion as to the acts on the bill, and he owed it to his paper and also to the theater-going public to do just that. iBesides, he would be doing the girl a favor by telling her in print that she was a failure behind the foot lights. So he finally wrote: "Miss Mildred Harrison is a very I attractive girl, with an entrancing per sonallty, but when it comes to vaude ville-dear Miss Harrison, may it not be suggested that you try some other means of earning a living? As a vaudevillist, Miss Harrison, you are not-well, you would make some young man a wonderful wife." Gary finished his criticism and hand ed It to the city editor, through whose hands it must pass. Then he went back to his machine. "I've killed that girl as far as her stage career is concerned," he sighed. "Her job expires tomorrow morning there's no doubt of that, because vaude ville ftns take the Star as their Bible." "And it also ends my job. After this I'm through. People may think it's fun slamming stage folk, but it isn't. It's better to be one." He wrote his resignation, to take effect in two weeks, and went home to bed. The next evening he went to the office early, and was greeted by the managing . editor, who in forrped him coldly that his resigna tion was to take immediate effect as his position already had been filled. Now, Gary was a vaudevillist him self. Two years before he had been popular on the stage, and had quit the game only because he had grown tired of the constant hopping from one town to another. There was a standing offer for his services right now, however, and he at once wired to the booking office-and received favorable reply. Gary was a good newspaper man. hbt he was a better stage performer. and within a year he had recaptured the old halo eof popularity that once had adorned his head. liis was a single act. with songs, monologue and sleight-if-land, and the house was sure to shake with appldause every time he appeared.

The evetilng subsequent to his first appearance at the Emtnpress le went to the Star office to renew ac quaintanweshilps. The managing e i tor greeted Itim affably andl an im pronmptu rece ptiin was held in the editorial rom:n. "By thie w\vy," li remall;rked to the city editor, "I'd like to imet your dramlatic Critic. le certainly 'id give me a hang-uip write-up in this imorini"'`& "tar. and I want to thanik itim. I rei'niimber the last criticism I wrote. It was not so complllimenltaKry to soie' minllemers of the gill." The city editor tilled his pipe. govir out assignmenlts to two reporters, ll swered three phline callis, borrowed :t match and said: "It happens that the 'he' you speak of is a girl. The funny part of it is that sihe's a former actress, the same as you're a former critic. She's not here just now, but she'll be on hand soon." Presently the young lady arrived and was introduced to the Empress headliner. Gary had tlhe shock of his life when he saw her, for she was none other than Mildred Harrison, the girl he had loved and had criticized the cause of his cutting loose from 'he newspaper world. "I'm glad to meet you," she told him, her eyes sparkling with more than sincerity. You know, I was once on the stage myself. I tried to make an actress of myself, but it was use less, anti it remained for the dramat ic critic on this very paper in this very town to show me the error of my ways. I owe that critic untold gratitude. espe cially since he was kind enough to re sign and leave open the only job I could fill on a newspaper. My stage experience was a fizzle, but it fitted me to be a critic of others." "I am very glad to meet you, too," he replied just as sincerely; "so glad that I am going to ask if I may not see you after the show tonight. My act is near the last, and I presume you will be attending some other performancg If I may call for you there-" He did, and they made their way to a quiet little restaurant, where they engaged in some serious conver sation over a light lunch. They talked in subdued tones, but they were desperately in earnest, as anyone with half an eye could have seen. Let us eavesdrop just a mo ment. We will drop into a chair at a nearby table just as he remarks: "Isn't it strange that I should fall In love with you the rmament I saw you on the stage, and that you-" "And that I," she finished, "should faill in love with you the moment I saw you on the stage, in the same theater a year later?" He sipped his coffee. "Well, it simply shows that I am a prophet. Didn't I tell you a year ago that you would make a wonderful wife?" Where All Could See. My most embarrassing moment was experienced at an evening church wedding a short time ago. .As we were late, most of the seats had been taken, so it was necessary to go al most to the front pew. I sat down and calmly removed my hat, when to my mortification my escort asked if I thought I was at the movies. The hat was hurriedly adjusted, but I felt self conscidus during the entire ceremony. -Chicago Tribune. Rose to Fame Unaided.

ART AS THE FRENCH SEE IT In Their Eyes It Is the Direct Antithe sis of Artifice as Generally Understood. No one can understand this French conception of art, as no one could un derstand the similar Greek conception, without distinguishing clearly be tween art and artifice. The first comment of the Anglo-Saxon on all art is likely to be that It is artificial: his comment upon the French life, it. self an art, is that it partakes too much of the quality of artifice. The difficulty is that such a comment as sumes civilization as a natural thing, said Prof. Erskine in a recent lec ture to his soldier students in France. The Frenchman knows better. When our mothers sent us to childhood par ties and cautioned us to behave, nat urally they did not mean what they said; they meant that we should wear our acquired arts of courtesy as though they were natural. In tbat sense all civiliation is not NatRal, and I uch 1ife, beln the el l h' chivlls& 'hau most the character of art. But the French themselves are even more severe than we are in condemning artifice, which to them is not art, but its most per verse enemy. Art for them must be frank and sincere, a quite open con trol of means to reach an intelligible ideal. There is nothing secret about it; its glory is the large part that reason and calculatiqn frankly play in it-as any choice between good and evil should be calculating and reason able. Artifice, on the other hand, is the putting on of disguise, the as suming of methods which do not har monize with the genuine puipose; it is too greqt emphasis upon means and too slight valuation of the noble end. Art is, as it were, the contrast or other pole to nature; It is the condition which is reached when man has given an interpretation and a direction to the chaos of crude experience. In be tween these extremes is artifice, par thking of the quality of both-half di. rected, half meaningless--New York Evening Post. A star cop at a car stop will pre vent accidents. JENKINS FREED FROM PRISON Peons Testified Against Jen kins Under Duress, State ment of Gonzales. XWashington --William O. .Jbnk!n the American coti-ular agnts i:!;,rý oned at l'uebla.

This difference in the two retrrt seemed to raise some douI h , ' whether Jenkins was released i;:, ':. i. tionally on the diplomatic re,r --: tions of the United States go' o, : w:: .,1, or whether he had been ro~l,-nsi ,.; bail, as the Mexican authori'ies have contended he could. T'he state (epartmlent, however, took the view that Jenkins had te-n re leased on its diplomatic repr--rnt tions, and issued a statement iil. after announcing Jenkins' release, said: "The release of Consular Agent etli; kins was brought about by urgent d:p lomatic representations made by this government and the resulting investi gation made by General Pablo Gon zales, who was sent to Puebla by the Mexican government to investigate the facts in the case. The investigations by General Gonzales, who was at Puebla December 3, had then practically sub stantiated the position taken by this government on behalf of Jenkins. "Two peons from Santa Lucia ad mitted to General Gonzales that they had made declarations against Jenkins under threat of execution. Other wit nesses testified that they had been compelled to make false statements against Jenkins under duress. One witness was threatened with a pistol. another suspended by a rope, and still another beaten until he made his dec laration against Jenkins.
