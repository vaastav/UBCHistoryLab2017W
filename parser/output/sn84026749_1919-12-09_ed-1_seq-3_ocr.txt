In view of the fact that the de fense contends that New was in love with the Lesser girl and that he killed her when she refused to be come the mother of their child, thi.?? testimony by Mrs. Drummond Is con sidered of much Importance. She said the Senator paid for a private tutor for New when the bo> was living in her neighborhood. On one occasion, she testified, the farti' r of one f the girls wh had tried to help New prohibited her from seein-i him. This affected New deeply, she ?aid. and he came to her home an?l "cried like a child." la Lore Right Away. "The minute a girl spoke to him in a decent way. right away he was in love with her,'" Mrs. Drummond testified. It was during the testimony of Mar tha Scudder. New's aunt, that direct reference was made to News parent age. Miss Scudder testified that Sen ator New had always taken care of the boy financially and that she had acted as intermediary in these trans actions. Then, through a question by Dis trict Attorney Woolwine, the charge that two children were born to Sena tor New and Mrs. Burger waa male by the witness.

The witneaa said New'? mother had been marrle-d three times In addition to the "unfortunate af fair with Senator New" Her eieter's husbands, she said, were John Sund, James Clancy, and Samuel Burger. Miss Scudder's testimony contained the first Intimation of the allegation that Senator New was the father of two sons. She testified that New's grand father, Edward D. Scudder. died In an insane asylum in 1889 and that New n.'ver developed mentally, the sub ject of his birth praying on his mind, oausing him to "mope for a week" over some "fancied slight" from his father. A touching episode of a meeting between Senator New and the boy was ?rentalned in the testimony given by Charles T. Williams, an Indianap olis attorney. Williams Is a partner of John W. Claypool. who. he testi fied, represented Mrs. Burger, then Misa Scudder, in the "paternity pro ceedings." Williams testified that New'? s-raid mother eulogized Senator New, while his mother abused him. As a result, he said. New did not know which to believe, and one day when he met face to face with the Senator on the street he lowered his head because he thought the Senator would "turn him down." Perte Arase A round Him. Instead. Williams testified. Senator New walked right straight up to the boy. put hia arms around him and took him to his office, where they talted for two hours. Later, Williams said, yonng New told him he never had any one to talk to him nicer than did the Sen ator. When New wanted to leave Indian apolis fcr Oklahoma. Williams testi fied. Senator New furnished the money. Williame said New had a "low mentality" and carried a chip on his shoulder because of the circum stances of his birth.

First Indiana national guard, was given by Colonel Tjrndall and other army officer?. a) Colonel Tyndall said he paid par ticular attention to New b'-cause he eras a friend of Senator New. He testified that "New shrank from con tact" with him and "was not nor mal" mentally. "SahnornyH Men tally.?? "Major Miller, an Indianapolis at torney, who was also at the border, testified that N< w was "subnormal" mentally and subji-ct to moodtnees. Gavin L Tlayne, of Indianapolis, captain of New's battery when It was at the border, said that New had an "unusual mentality" and a "brooding t< r?per??ment " He said the officers, bfcnir.se they knew of New's alleged p-irentae?. had sym pathy for him an.il were anxious to irive him a fair ehanee f?,r promotion.
