London, Dec.o.President Roosevelt's declaration in his message to congress vesterday on the treatment accorded to Japanese in the San Francisco schools appeals to the British at the present time because both in South Africa and Australia a similar anti-Asiatic feeling has created embarrassment for the im perial authorities. During the present week the home government vetoed a Transvaal ordi nance further restricting the privileges of British Indians, even those long res ident in the country, -while quite recent ly the government refused to accept an Australian proffer of a preferential ta riff "provided_the goods were shipped rif in vessels not employing yellow sea men.''

CASE I N THE SENATE Senator Rayner, with Resolution, Opens Discussion in Upper House. Journal Special Serooo. Washington, Dec. 6.The doctrine o states' rights as involved in the Japanese school question, taken in con nection with the president's observa tions on this subiect in his annual mes sage to congress, was brought before the senate yesterday and will form the basis of discussion during the next few days. The suggestion of the president that the civil and military power of the government should be exercised in cases similar to that which has arisen San Francisco, aroused some of the southern senators, Mr. Rayner of Maryland was among this number. prepared a lesolution, which he offered immediately after the reading of the message. The resolution follows: Wants State Backed Up. Resolved, That, in the opinion of the senate this government has no right to enter into any controversy with any for eign government relating to the public school system of any of the states in the union Resolved fuither, That it is the opin ion of the senate that theie is no pro vision in the treaty between the United States and the government of Japan that relates in any manner to this subject or in any way mtei feres with the right of the state of California to conduct and ad minister its system of public schools accordance with its, own legislation, and Resolved further, That it is the duty of the president Of the United States to notify the government of Japan and to notify any foieign government with which the question may arise that the public educational institutions of the state are not within the jurisdiction of the United States, and that the United States has no power to regulate or su pervise their administration Mr. Rayner regards this feature of the president's message as the most in defensible recommendation Mr. Roose velt has yet made Misinformed, They Think. Among the senators generally the presidents chapter on the Japanese question is regarded as being the re sult of misihfSijmaition. The leading lawvers of the senate agree with tho president that a tieaty is the supreme law of the land and mtlst be recog nized as such by each state. There is a difference of "opinion among" them as to whether the tieaty between the United States and Japan permits Jap anese children to attend any public school they may select. A ma-jority contend that no such provision is con tained in the treaty and that it has not been violated bv the action of the San Francisco authorities. Senator Perkins of California took a conservative view of the president's suggestions and said: I agree with the sentiment expressed by the presi dent as an abstract proposition, iust as any patritotic citizen would, but I do not agree with him in its applicV tion to the school trouble in San Fran cisco. W have violated no treaty. The action in the school trouble was no more a violation of a treaty than the order for the vaccination of all the pupils in the San Francisco schools."

SOCIETY IS GROWING STATE HORTIOULTUBAL ORGAN- IZATION HAS INCREASE*) EIGHT-FOLD I N FIFTEEN YEARS. Yesterday's late proceedings on page 4. Memmebrship in the Minnesota Hor ticultural society has increased eight fold in. th elast fifteen years. This fact, presented in the annual report of Sec retary A. W. Latham at the morning session of the annual meeting in the First Unitarian church is considered by the members a fair indication of the advancement which has been made in the horticultural pursuits of the state. Secretary Latham referred to the in* terest which was being taken in the competitions of the society and an nounced that forty-eight fruit-growers had entered the contest for the $1,000 premium offered for the development of a, seedling apple tree "as hardy and prolific as the Duchess with fruit equal to the Wealthy in size, quality and ap pearance, and that will keep as well as the Melinda." One hundred and fifty- five members of the association have announced their entries for the $100 premium offered annually for five years beginning in 1912, for the best late winter seedling apples. Treasurer A. B. Lyman of Excelsior reported a balance of $2,587.92 in the society treasury. The remainder of the morning ses sion was given over to the filing of reports from the different vicepresi ttents of the association. The vice presidents, one in each congressional district, were allowed two minutes apiece in which to discuss their re ports..

FAMINE CASE OPENS HEREDEC:17 I Contmued From First Page. west generally, and inquired whether the commission, in its judgment, "has any authority under the present law to compel an interstate carrierconduct a to furnish actefliiate equipment to the traffic along its line, and. if the com mission has no such power, whether congress, under the commerce clause of the constitution, is empowered to dele gate such power to the commission." Senator Hansbrough also addressed a letter to the interstate commission as a, whole strongly urging that steps be taketn have an inquiry in th north Je tto clear up the situation,e saying that he did not know anything more important to the welfare and prosperity of the northwest at this time than ade quate traffic facilities. Knapp Sees Limitations. That part of Senator Hansbrough's letters to Judge Knapp, which is quoted above, presents the case in a nutshell, and in his reply to this letter Judge Knapp states the case so clearly from the viewpoint of the commission, point ing out the limitations which surround that body, and indicating in a quite positive way that there is perhaps no adequate remedy which the commission can offer for the existing evils, that I quote him in full. says, speaking for the entire commission, under date Dec. 4, and addressing Senator Hans brough: "In reply to your letter addressed to myself and your letter addressed to the commission, I write to say: The in ability of shippers to secure cars for the movement of their traffic is re ported from various parts of the coun try, and amounts in some sections, as you observe, to almost a calamity. This matter has given the commisison sne cial concern, altho we appear to be without adequate authority to deal with such a situation. W can exercise no direct power to compel interstate carriers to furnish adequate equipment, nor are we prepared at this time to recommend specific legislation upon this subject. Can Hit Discrimination. "If a given carrier unjustly dis criminates between shippers in distri buting its car supply, we could un doubtedly make an enforcible order of relief,, after investigating a complaint and giving the carrier a hearing. W could also perhaps award reparation for damages resulting from failure to supply sufficient cars, but our power to do so is not altogether certain. More over, any award by us in a proceeding brought for that purpose would estab lish only a prima facie case against the carrier in a auit brought in the federal courts to enforce the order. Inasmuch as such a proceeding goes upon the theory of awarding damages, it would seem to be rather more suitable and ef ficient for aggrieved shippers to bring their suits in the courts in the first in stance. "We have, however, ordered an in vestigation of this matter of car short age, and will prosecute it w^th utmost dispatch. Already agents have been sent to the northwest, and it is expect ed that hearings will take place in that region within the next two weeks. "This appears to be the most effect ive course the commission can take, and you may be assured that every thing will be done within the scope of our authority to bring about the earli est possible relief." Public Opinion a Factor. The question may be asked, why, if the commission probably has no power to relieve the present situation, has it ordered an inquiry? The answer is easyrthe most power ful instrument in this country is pub lic opinion. I can do more than any law or any court. I is the plan of the commission to get at the underly ing causes for the shortage in its Min neapolis inquiry, and then it will trust in part to the publicity which be given the testimony to work the needed re lief. Meanwhile, there is just a possibili ty that the commission has more au thority than Judge Knapp is now will ing to claim for it. The new rate law has not yet been adjudicated, and' hence the commission is very properly modest in saying that it can do this or that particular thing. The commission is willing to do the best it can, and this it will do in the northwest. Should the testimony jus tify such a course there is no doubt but an effort will be made to apply the new law to the guilty parties. Then will come the testing of that portion of law by the courts. Incidentally to this, as has already been stated, it is figured that publicity will bring some measure of relief. Experts in Field. The commission has half a dozen ex perts already in the spring-wheat belt in the northwest for the purpose of picking up all possible facts and hav ing them ready when the commission begins its work by Thursday of this week. Perhaps a dozen of these ex perts will be in the field. John H. Marble, secretary for the commission, is to go to Minneapolis in a few days to superintend the work of these experts. Mr. Marble is well known in the northwest thru the work he did in Minneapolis when the com mission was investigating the eleva tors. Shippers Asked to Help. I am again asked to say to the people of the northwest that the com mission desires this active co-opera tion in securing evidence bearing on shortage conditions. Men who know things which will help the inquiry along are requested to tell them to the special agents who are now be ginning to cover the northwest field. The more thoroly this work is done the more quickly and satisfactorily will the work of the commission itself be done later on, and a decision reached. It is very apparent that if people in the Dakotas and Minnesota who are affected by the car shortage will take on half the enthusiasm and determina tion that now characterizes the com mission, the case will be brought to a finish before the end of many days.
