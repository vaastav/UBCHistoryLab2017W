THURSDAY DEC. r.00 Perhaps the country la pros peroua but somehow or other many people who usually have money are a little shy just now when we ash for what is due us. It takes hustling even these times. to keep One tliiuj message Is ; SUI e the pr Ions enough isidents No one trusts are will d . n y prosperous. lllllt the! Gov. Dockery during the Campaign invited Joe Flory to look over the books a t Jetl'erson City. Wili Mr. Plory accept the invitation and look over the books to sec what had become of the school fund? As a good citizen he should do soandaf ter he has examined the books he should tell the people just how he tound things. If the Democrats have been Stealing Joe Plory should be in position to give accurate information. Then if he linds the school fund all safe and the books straight he should tell the people the truth about the matter. Do not expect any good thin; to come to tin- people from con gress. Democracy will Continue to stand forequal rights to all and specia I fa voi s to none. Keep ii organissati try. P t e Democratic lis all over t lie club conn Laws which are just to the corporations and just to the masses are the kind of laws Un people ask for. The trusts must be heard from before the country can have any Idea what is the mean ing of the presidents message. George VV Peck, of "Peck's Mad Mov" fame, is iroinif to re vive "Peck's M.ni Boy" and write a new series of Mad Moy Papers entitled "Peck's Mad Moy Grown Up." Doubtless those who relished his former work will rally to him again. December SHIl. Mr. Peck will begin a special engagement as editor of the comic supplement of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and will shoulder responsibil it' lor everything in It. Mi Peck will sure make his read ers laugh. L. Hal lock spent week- at Liberty Somehow or other the Moers and Filipinos refuse to stay whipped. They are lighting for their liberty which is a Cod given right. More taxes will be wrung from the people to pay for that li f4 standing army which the majority of the people voted for. It is not philanthropy but greed that causes many mil lionaires to endow big colleges. This is shown when the mil lionaire attempts to dictate what shall be taught in the en dowed college. Mrs. Dora part ol the with her daughter, Miss May me who is the teacher in the Odd Fellows Home. The Orphans of Odd Fellows have a teacher of whom they should be proud. She is competent and is a noble young woman. The school will be taught in the new Home building after the 15th of December and the Home will be dedicated just after the close of the Grand Lodge next May. Our Republican friends will pass the Manna Payne-Fry ship subsidy steal and thus take from the people $20U,000,000, and give it to some of the con tributors to Mark's slush fund. During the campaign the country was assured that the Republican party had given the country just such currency legislation as was needed. Now comes the president and asks for some kind of tinkering with currency laws. A ship builder is not any more entitled to be paid a sub sidy than is a fanner or labor ing man. It is downright rob bery to take the peoples money and give it to a class already much more prosperous than is the average citizeD. R. M. Sharp was here from Marceline part of the week. Mrs. George Green, who lias been sick for several days, was reported much better yesterda.y Services at Presbyterian church Friday Evening and Saturday afternoon at 8 o'clock preparatory to communion on Sunday. if you have something to get for some one as a Christmas, or weddling present you will loose no time in coming to Wood's Drug Store because you can Hud something to suit, and to please you. B. O. Wood. Chrrles Hergau and wife came in Friday night from Moline, Kansas to visit relatives. Mr. Mergan says a big crop was raised in the part ot Kansas in which he lives and that bus iness is good. The Chicago Times Herald (Republican): "President Mc Kinley's annual message o con gress contains much interesting matter, but very little that is new, and although 20,000 words long is most remarkable for A t A . V . wnai it aoes not say. it is almost dumb as to the future. Our only fear is that the presi dent has made his messiage so long ttat few congressmen will read its final injunction to econ omy, vigilance and industry." Opposition Not Obstruction, In discussing the probable course the democrats will take during the closing session of the fifty-sixth congress, Sena tor Jones expresses the opinion that his party associates in the senate and house will not re sort to obstructive tactics to defeat or delay the legislative programme determined upon by jthe republicans. While he does not think the result of the elections turned so much on the issues that will be brought forward in congress as upon the desire of many peo ple to let well enough alone, he believes iu the government of the majority, and that his col leagues will give due weight to the idea that the country has voted in favor of the republi cans. It is probable that democrats in congress will reason about this matter pretty much as Senator Jones does. They will not feel called upon to obstruct the republican programme for the Philippines except in so far as it atteupts the fasting upon the country oi a permanent standing army ol large porpor tions They will endeavor, while agreeing to whatever In crease may be deemed accessary to accomplish the restoration of peace ami order Jlu the islands, toueteat wlttt the par liamentry weapons at their com mand the passage of any bill which erects upon a lirm foot ing an immense military estab lishment similar to the ones that are grinding the faces of the taxpayers in European coun-1 tries Democrats in both branches of congress may be relied upon to register an emphatic disap proval, by their voices and votes, of every measure brought forward by the repub lican majority that is hostile to those time-honored principles which the democracy has always contended were vital to the happiness, welfare and in terests of ali the prople It can confidently be relied on that the democrats in congress will denounce and disapprove the ship subsidy steal for the enrichment of predatory cor porations. They will protest, as vigorously as may be, against the ratification of the Hay-Pauucefote treaty, which recognizes the right of a foreign nation to dictate the conditions under whicc an enterprise, ap proved by American of all parties and to be built by Am erican skill, with American money and throuhg American territory, shall be conducted. Iu a word, the plan the demo crats will pursue in congress will be to oppose whatever legislation they deem inimical to the best interests of the people and subversive of the fundamental principles of our system of gove.nment, but not to uselessly and arbitrarily in dulge in a policy of parliamen tary obstruction.
