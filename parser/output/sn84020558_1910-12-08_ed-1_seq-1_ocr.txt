I am sincerely anxious to see Arizona admitted to the Union, and I advise our friends there to adopt a constitution free from all debatable provisions, so as to so cure statehood without delay.

"Oh. ye stiffnecked and slow of heart to believe alf that the prophets have spoken." s The foregoing warning by Senator Bailey of Texas, a repetition of the advice steadfastly givenfcby The Re publican from the outset of the cam paign was contemptuously and even indignantly rejected yesterday by the constitutional convention, strengthen ing an assertion made by this iaper weeks ago that If -a messenger from congress and the White House ac companied by an angel .from heaven were sent to the convention, that body "wpuld still proceed upon its course to ruin. The telegram from Senator Bailey was in response to one .gent him by Messrs Cobb and " Webb as follows: !,Xov. 23, 1910. 'Hon. Joseph W. Bailey. "Gainesville, Texas. "Constitutional convention has adopted initiative referendum has proposition to insert recall applicable to all officials including judiciary. Would these provisions in your opin ion ondangor. appro.val of constitution by president and congress? Will treat answer as confidential for democrats or for publication as you indicate. (Signed) V. T. 

WEBB. "LAMAR COBB. "Democratic Members." The telegram from Mr. Bailey was received on Monday. The recipients were in doubt until yesterday morn ing as to the disposition to be made of it. They hardly believed that it would avail anything in the evident tompcr of the- convention but later they regarded" the disclosure of it as a duty they owed to the territory Even then it was not their purpose to give it publicity but to make it known only to the members of the majority. Rumors of the existence of the tel agram had reached the ear of. most of the radicals and they assembled in needless nervousness yesterday morning for If there was to be an assault upon the sacred "recall" it would be made -then. The article had been reached in the afternoon before in the going over the printed articles of the constitution for the last time. A half dozen members of the con vention were absent and -a call of the house, was demanded ny the rad icals, though the majority of the absentees would probably have voted for a modification of the recall arti cle. Nearly an hour was lost during the call and Mr. Webb sought to secure a suspension of the rules In order that there might be a conference of the members of the majority: he had something to show them. Half the democrats wanted to sep the curi osity. But the leaders of the "pro gressives" did not want It placed on exhibition and joined by the repub licans who felt no interest in the communication, the motion to sus pend the rules failed. The Opening Round. A little later the proceedings under the call were dispensed with and the recall article was taken up. Judge Baker moved that it be stricken out and he offered a substitute for It in the terms of the platform of the Maricopa county democratic conven tion which Instructed Its delegates to direct the Ivgislature tp enact a recall measure. Judge Baker spoke briefly In favor of the substitute but it was defeated by a vote of 15 to 31., The repub licans with the. exception of Mr. Curtis voted against it. Thus it was clear that the minority would sup port no temporizing measure or one looking to a modification of the -recall article for purposes of expediency. In the face of this hopeless sltua 'tlpn, Mr. Cassidy offered a motion to refer the article to the committee op separate submission that it might hp placed before the voters separately from the constitution. The first argu ment he offered in support of this motion was the statement that would bring out a larger vote at the elec tion on the constitution. It was any how, said Mr. Cassidy, a matter that ought to go before the people. It would be an application of the prin ciple of the referendum to a most important matter. Said Mr. Cassidy: "There are many who doubt the wis dom of retaining the article -in the constitution: they believe that its j a menace to statehood. The people i are as sincere as the members of this convention and are as capable of exercising judgment. If we submit the question separately and it carries that will forever close the mouths of its opponents. It will cut the ground from under the feet of th- opposition and will rob them of their thunder." "Don't you believe it." was an in junction from a member of the "op position." The Texas Exhibit. Then for the first time the Bailey telegram made its appearance. Judge Baker asked the permission of Mr. Webb to offer it and it was granted. Judge Baker spoke briefly of the danger of proceeding against advice from such a source, from a man who had the interest of Arizona at heart. Mr. Webb explained the circum stances under which the telegram had been received. In the telegram which had called it out, Messrs yebb and Cobb had referred to the in itiative and referendum, for the purpose of apprising Mr. Bailey of the adop tion by the convention of the means by which a recall system could be put In operation, once statehood had been secured. But the senator seem ed to have seized upon the initiative and referendum itself as ' one of the debatable things which had better be left out of the constitution. Judge Baker said that the sub- j "mission of the question to the people would r.at 'change the ultimate pur pose and would clear the constitution itself of the debatable matter con cerning which the senator from Texas had given warning. Mr. Fecncy asked Judge Baker which Mr. Bailey had considered " the more debatable, the recall or the In itiative and referendum. "I'm not answering questions for Senator Bailey," replied Judge Baker, who added that as for himself lie did not consider the initiative and referendum debatable at all. Mr. Parsons said that he had in tended to say no more on the subject but in view of the latest move that had been made against the recall he believed that he would be wanting in justice to his constituents as well as to himself If he should preserve si lence. "There is no need," said he. "to inquire what the people want. They have told us what they want and if they had not done so in the conventions then the letters and tele grams we have had since this sub ject was brought before us would tell us. Xobody has asked for a sep arate submission of this question; even the minority here does not want it." Repudiation of Bailey. Mr. Parsons then addressed him self to that interloper' from Texas. "This communication," said he. "comes from a very appropriate and con sistent source. I'm a democrat and Senator Bailey says he is," and then Mr. Parsons thanked God that he was not the kind of a democrat Sen ator Bailey Is. The suggestion of the senator, he said, would resplt iiv a wishy washy constitution whereas the constitution that had already been agreed upon was the best ever framed for the government of a free people. Mr. Parsons then referred to a re cent interview with Governor Sloan in Washington in which the governor had stated that the constitution would not be approved. He denounced the governor and declared that he and Senator Bailey would be "a good pair to draw to." In conclusion. Mr. Parsons said that he preferred the good opinion of his constituents and that-if they per sisted in well doing they would be met on their return with brass bands. Mr. Wood spoke of the iron clad instructions of the Yavapai delegates dnd lie again read an editorial from the Democrat confirming the opinion of the advocates of the recall that they were right. Mr. Webb replying to Mr. Parsons' statepient regarding messages from home said that lie had received many advising him to do the thing lie now wished to do,xsubmit this matter to the people. As to the delegates from Yavapai and Gila county, Mr. Webb said that they were allowed no choice in the matter but lie urgd those who were not so bound to sup port the Cassidy mutton a:; one likely to make statehood mor. certain. A Defender of the Texan. Mr. Cunniff though in .sympathy with the purposes of Mr. Parsons could not subscribe to his diatribe against Senator Bailey whom he re garded as the ablest and bralnest man In the United States senate and a true friend of Arizona. "But for the work of Senator Bailey," said lie. "we would not now be. here framing a constitution." Mr. Cunlff added by way of a postscript that whatever might be the views of the Texns senator, the convention had received no Instructions from him while they had received most definite ones from their constituents. Dr. Tuthill replying to the state ment that the Yavapai delegation had been rigidly instructed lbinted out that the people of that county could not have been firmly set in favor of this recall, otherwise Judge Wells would not have been elected. Turning to the danger of that feature of the recall article including the judiciary, Dr. Tuthill quoted the following from the message of President Taft: ' "I wish to renew my urgent rec ommendation made In my last annual message in favor of the pressage of a law which shall regulate the is suing of injunctions in equity without notice in accordance with the best practice now in vogue in the courts of the United States. I regard this of especial importance, first, because it has been promised, and. second, because It w,ill deprive those who now complain of certain alleged abuses In the improper issuing of in junctions without notice of any real ground for further amendment and will take away all semblance of sup port for the extremely radical legis lation they projose, which will be most pernicious if adopted, will sap the foundation of judicial power and legalize that cruel instrument, the secondnry boycott." "Do you think." asked Dr. Tuthill, "that that man will approve a con stitution with such a provision In It?" The . Cassidy motion was defeated by the following: Ayes. 17 Baker, Cassidy. Cobb.

Mr. President. The Last Feeble Effort. One more hopeless effort was made by Mr. Lynch to strike out the pro vision with respect to the judiciary and when that 'failed the question of the final adoption of the article went with the fplIowlng result, ayes, 3S; nays. 9. Dr. Tuthill alone voted with the minority. This statehood coffin nail having thus been clinched, Mr. Roberts in troduced a resolution censuring Gov ernor Sloan for having expressed his sentiments regarding the constitution in the Washington Interview. The resolution looked to the forwarding of copies of it to the president of the United States and all the mem bers of congress. In the opinion of Mr. Cunningham such a proceeding would be most unwise and the motion for the adoption of the resolution was indefinitely postponed. ?

NFORMALLY t Probable Finish of Ballkiger Pinchot Investigation THREE1 REPORTS ARE FILED Opinion General That They Will Be Pigeon-Holed Investigation of Mexican Influence in the Govern- . mental Departments. Washington. Dec. 7. Interest in congress today centered In the report ing to botli houses ot the findings of the Balllnger-Plnchot investigating committee. Three reports were filed the majority report, clearing the sec retary of all churges; the minority re port, finding against him, and an indi vidual reiort by Ibyfesentativc Madi son, Insurgent repuoHcan of Kansas, which was also condemnatory. The senate ordered 50,000 copies of the re ports printed. The result of the committee's work will probably prove negligible for the report leaves the question just where it was when it started and there is said to be trouble ahead if a vote is called to determine which report shall be adopted. Under the arrangement a dis senting report is given equal standing with the majority roport before both houses. An effort will undoubtedly be made to put the house on record as to its opinion of 'the majority report. Some democratic members favor demanding consideration of the reiort.at the first opportunity, following up their demand with an appeal from the decision of the chair, should Speaker Cannon rule them out of order. In case the speaker permits matters to take their course it is held by parliamentarians that a resolution demanding a vote would be necessary. Such a resolution would h'ave to go to some standing commit tee for report, and as no such com mittee would relish the responsibility the resolution probably would be pigeonholed. The general feeling is that there will be no action on the report at this ses sion, which means not at all, for the report loses Its force with the expira tion of the present congress In March. In the house the day was occupied by the consideration of bills on the calen dar, the Indian appropriation bill be ing the first of the big supply meas ures Introduced. It carried $S,160,S95. 

ANOTHER INVESTIGATION. Washington, Dec. 7. Representative Wilson of Pennsylvania, who repre sents a district that Includes a large mining population, will press the house rules committee for quick action on his resolution to investigate the charge that the Mexican government is using the judicial and state departments of this government In persecuting politic al rofugees. Wilson Is conferring witli the state department officials to secure Informa tion .concerning the arrest of Juan Sanchez Azcona, an alleged Mexican revolutionist, by United States au thorities, and, it is said, will In a couple of days demand action in the matter. THE LORIMER CASE. Washington, Dec. 7. Robert L. Wil son, state representative of Illinois, to day denied that he had given money or anything of value to any member of the general assembly of that state either to influence or pay for his vote for Lorimer as senater. Mr. Wilson appeared before the sen ate sub-coinlttee in response to a subpoena. He said he had gone to St. Louis in June. 1909, not to distribute money for southern Illinois democrats in return for votes for Lorimer, but to arrange a banquet given In honor of Browne, the democratic loader. After cross-examination by S. Aus trian, attorney for the Chicago Tribune, the witness was turned over t Judge Elbaidge Ilanecy, counsel for Lorimer. Wilson, under a question by Attorney Austrian, said he did not remember what had been said In the room in the St Louis hotel where he met Rep resentative Shepard. The testimony of Representative Beckmeyer, however, that he had given them "packages" was not true, said the witness. The testimony of Wilson concluded the examination of the committee. Sen ator Burrows, chairman, calh-d an ex ecutive session of the sub-committee and the committee will endeavor to formulate a report within the next two weeks. COMMANDER PLATT DEAD. Washington, Dec. 7. Commander Robert Piatt. U. S. X.. retired, died here at his home late today, following an attack of cerebral embolism, with which lie was stricken three weeks ago.

Washington, Dec. 7. Another statue erected In honor of a distinguished foreign soldier, who helped to bring success to the American arms during the revolution, was unveiled today and now the figure of Baron von Steuben fills the last of the fpur cor ners of Lafayette square, facing the White House. On the other three cor ners stand the heroic bronae figures of Lafayette, Rochambeau and Kosci- I 11 SCO. The German-Americans gathered om all parts of the country to par ticipate in the imposing military and' civic parade and ceremonies. Presi-' dent Taft itaid high tribute to Von Steuben for his work in bringing up the efficiency of the American arms. Miss Helen Taft released the Ameri can flags draped about the statue, and Count von Bernstorff, German ambassador; Representative Richard Bartholdt of St.. Louis and Charles Hexanier, president of the German American Alliance, delivered addresses which recounted the services of Von Steuben. The scene of unveiling was one of unusual inipressiveness. Lafay ette Park Jay 0aai!ia3now, but over head was the brilliant winter sun shine and a cloudless sky. An am phitheater of the flag-draped stands had been erected about the statue and from scores of staffs the German and American flags were flying. Soldiers, sailors and marines were drawn up in the streets and the adjacent square. The president's advent was heralded by a blast of trumpets and he was escorted by the White Horse troop of cavalry. Mr. Taft's remarks follow: "I dedicate today the last monument which fills the four corners of this beautiful square and which monu ments testify )o the gratitude of the American people to those from France, Poland and Prussia who aided them In the struggle for national indepen dence and existence. "Lafayette, Rochambeau. Kosciusko. Van Steuben contributed much to the success of the American arms in the revolution. The assistance of the first I three was perhaps more conspieuous and specfacular than that of von Steuben, but not so valuable. "Von Steuben was a trained soldier from his boyhood. He learned his profession in the best schools that is, actual warfare, under the instruction of the greatest master of the art of war in the eighteenth century. The character and severity of the drill and the discipline and tactics- of the German army were exceptional in the days of Frederick William ami of Frederick the Great, as they are to day. "Baron von Steuben came to this country actuated by the highest mo tives of patriotism to help us achieve liberty, and brought with him that which was without money anw with out price he Infused into the rank and file of the revolutionary' army discipline and order. "He began the difficult task with the arm at Valley Forge in the win ter of 1777-7S, and as early as May of 1S7S his influence for good was manifested at the battle of Monmouth and ether campaigns of that year. Alexander Hamilton, the accomplished soldier, testif'ert to the marvelous ef fect of A on Steuben's discipline on tiie action of the American soldiers Jnder fire. "The effect of Von Steuben's disolp nllue on the .inerioan army teaehea a lesson it is well for us all to keep hi mird. and that is that no people, however warlike the spirit of ambi tion, natural courage and self confi dence can be made with, only uni fjrnw and guns, a military force. Until they learn drill and discipline, they are a mob. and the theory that they can te madr itno an army over night will cost, this nation billions of dollars and thousands of lives, v "The history of Von Steuben's ser vice shows him kindly and consider ate of the brave and accomplished s ddier. As irspf ctor general his achievements were not the success of independent command, but the preiwr ation by persistent and tedious drill ing and distip'ine.'
