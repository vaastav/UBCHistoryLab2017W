To the Senate and Mouse of Representative - Since the convening of Congress one year ago the Nation has undergone a prostration in business and industries such as has not been witnessed with lis for many vears. Speculation as to the causes of'tbif prostration might be in dulged in without profit, because as many theories would be advanced as there would be indeDendent- writers those who exnressed their own views. With out dwelling upon the subject without indulging in theories as to the cause of this prostration, i will only can your at tention to the lact, ana one question 'to which it would seem there should be no disagreement. During this prostra tion two essential elements of prosperi ty have been most abundant labor ana capital. Both have been largely unem ployed. Where security has been un doubted, capital has been attainable at very . moderate rates ; where labor has been wanted it has been found in abund ance, at cheap rates compared with what necessaries and comforts of life could be purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elements of prosperity there fore have not been denied us. A third might be added. Our soil and climate are unequaled within the limits of any contiguous territory" under one nation ality, for its variety of products to feed and clothe a people, and in the amount of surplus to spare to feed less favored people. Therefore, with these facts in view it seems to me that wise statesman ship at this session of Congress would dictate, ignoring the-past, the directing in proper channels these great elements of prosperity to any people. Debt abroad is the only element that can. with always a sound currency, enter into our affairs to cause any continued depression in the industries and prosperity of our people. A great conflict for National existence made necessary for temporary purposes the raising of large sums of money Irom whatever source attainable. It was nec essary in the wisdom of Corrgress, and I do not doubt their wisdom in the premi ses, regarding the necessity of the times, to devise a system of National currency Which it proved to be impossible to keep on a par with the recognized currency oi the civilized world. This begot a spirit of speculation, involving an extravagance and luxury not required for the happi ness or prosperity of a people, and in volving both directly and indirectly for eign indebtedness. The currency being of fluctuating value, therefore unsate to hold for legiti mate transactions requiring money, be- a. BiiViiect of speculation in itself. These two causes, however, have involved us in a foreign indebtedness contracted in good faith by borrower and lender, which should be paid in coin and accord ing to the bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted, in gold or its equiv alent. The good faith of the govern ment cannot be violated toward creditors without national disgrace. Our com merce should be incouraged, American ship-building and carrying greatly in creased, foreign markets sought foi the products of the soil and manufactures, to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where a market can be created for the salefSjf, our products, either of the soil, the mine or manufac tory, a new means is discovered of utiliz ing our idle capital and labor,-to the ad vantage of the whole people. But, in my judgment, the first step towards this object, is to secure a currency good wherever civilization reigns; one which, if it becomes superabundant with oue people, will find a market with some other; a currency which has as its basis the labor necessary to produce it, which will give it value. Gold and silver are now the recognized mediums of exchange the civilized world over, and this we should return to with the least practica ble delay. In view of the pledges of the Ameri can Congress when "our present legal tender system was adopted and debt con tracted, " there should be no delay, cer tainly no unnecessary delay, infixing by legislation a method by which we will i return tq specie. To the accomplish ment of this end I invite your special attention. I believe firmly that there can be no permanent revival of business or industries until a policy is adopted, with legislation to carry it out, looking to a return to specie basis. It is easy to conceive that the debtor and speculator may think it of value to them to make so-called money abundant until they can throw a portion of their burdens upon others; but even these I believe would be disappointed in the result if a course should be pursued which will keep in doubt the values of the legal tender me dium of exchange. A. revival of produc tive industries is needed by all classes by none more than the holders of prop erty, of whatever sort, with debts to liq uidate, by realization upon its sales. But, admitting that these two classes of citizens are to be benefited by expansion would it be honest to give it? Would not the general loss be too great to justi fy such relief? Would it not be just as honest and prudent to authorize each debtor to issue his own legal tenders to the extent of his liabilities than to do this ? Would it not be safer, for fear of over issues by unscrupulous creditors, : to say that all debt obligations are oblitera ted in the United States and now we commence anew, each possessing all he has at the time free from incumbrance. These propositions are too absurd to be entertained for a moment by thinking people. Every delay in the preparation of final resumption partakes of this dis honesty, and is only less in degree as the hope is held out that the convenient season will at last revive for the good work of redeeming our pledges to com mence. It will never come, in my opin ion, except by positive action by Con gress or by national disasters, which will destroy for a time at least, the credit of individuals and the State at large. A sound currency must not be reached by total bankruptcy of the credit or integ rity of the Nation and individuals. I believe it is in the power of Congress at this session to devise such legislation as will revive confidence, revive all the in dustries, start us on the career of pros perity and save the credit of the people. Step toward the return to a specie basis are the great requisites to this end, de voutly to be sought for, and there are others which I may touch upon hereaf ter. A nation dealing in a currency be low that of specie in value labors under two great disadvantages. first, having no use for the world's acknowledged me dium of exchange, gold and silver, these are driven out of the country, because - there is no demand for their use. Sec ond The medium of exchange being of a fluctuating value tor, after all, it is only worth just what it will purchase of gold and silver metals, having an intrin sic value just in proportion to the honest labor it takes to produce them, a large margin must be allowed for profit by the manufacturer and producer. It is months from the date of production to the date of realization. Interest upon capital must be charged ; a risk of fluc . tuation In the value of that which is to be received in payment added,. Hence high prices, acting as a protection to the foreign producer, who receives nothing jn exchange for the product of his skill and labor, except a currency good at a tsnla value the world over. It seems to me that nothing is clearer than the greater part of the burden of the existing prostration, for the want of a sound fi nancial system, falls upon the working man, who must, after all, produce the wealth, and the salaried man who super intends and conducts business. The burden falls upon them in two ways by the deprivation of employment and by the decreased purchasing power of their salaries. It is the duty of Congress to devise a method of correcting the evils which are acknowledged to exist, and not mine, but 1 will venture to suggest two or three things which seem to me abso lutely necessary to a return to specie pay ments. The first great requisite in a return to sp.cie prosperity is that the legal-tender clause to the law authorizing the issue of currencv by the National ftnvei-nment should be repealed, to take effort tn all contracts entered into fW a dT fixed in the repealing act, but nnt anr.lv however, to payments of salaries bv the Government, or other ex nen.es now provided bv law to be paid in currency. In the interval pending be tween the repeal and final resumption, provision should be made by which the Secretary of the Treasury can obtain gold as it may become necessary irom unie vo time from the date when specie resump tion commenced. To this might and should be added a revenue sufficiently in excess of expenses to insure an accumula tion of gold in the Treasury to sustain redemption. 1 commend this subiect to your care ful consideration, believing that a favora ble solution is attainable, and that if reached by this Congress the present and future generations Will ever gratefully remember it as their deliverer from a thralldom of evil and dissrace. With re demption, free banking may be authorized with safety, giving the full protection to bill holders which they have under the existing laws. Indeed, I would regard free banking as essential, it wouia give proper elasticity to the currency. As more currency should be required lor the transaction of legitimate business, new banks would be started, ' and in turn . banks would wind up their business, when it was found that there was a superabundance of currency. The experience and judgmentof the peo ple can best decide just how much cur rency is required for the transaction of the business of the country. It is unsaie to leave the settlement of this question to Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Executive. Congress should make the regulation under which banks may exist, but should not make banking a monopoly by limiting the amount of 're deemable paper currency that shall be authorized. Such importance do I attach to this subject, and so earnestly do I com mend it to your attention, that I give it prominence by introducing it at the be ginning of this message. During the'past year nothing has oc curred to disturb the general friendly and cordial relations of the United States with other powers. The correspondence submitted herewith, between this Gov ernment and its diplomatic representa tives of other countries shows a satisfac tory condition of all questions between the United States and most of those coun tries, and, with few exceptions, to which reference is hereafter made, the absence of any points of difference to be adjusted- The notice directed bv the resolution Congress of June 17, 1874, to be given to terminate the Convention of July 17, IsoS, between the United States and Belgium, has been given, and the treaty will ac cordingly terminate on the first day of July, 1875. This Convention secured to certain Belgian vessels entering the ports of the United States exceptional privi leges which are not accorded to our own vessels. Other features of the Conven tion have proved satisfactory, and have tended to the cultivation of the mutually beneficial commercial intercourse and friendly relations between the two coun tries. I hope that negotiations which have been invited will result in the cele bration of another treaty which may tend to the interests of both countries. Our relations with China continue to be friendly. During the past year the fear of hostilities between China and Japan, growing out of the landing of an armed lorce upon the island or f ormosa by the latter has occasioned uneasiness. It is earnestly hoped, however, that the difficulties arising from this cause will be adjusted, and that the advance of civiliza tion in these Empires may not be retard ed by a state of war. In consequence of the part taken by certain citizens of the United States in this expedition, our representatives in those countries have been instructed to impress upon the Gov ernments of China and Japan the firm intention of this country to maintain strict neutrality in the event of hostili ties, and carefully prevent any infraction of law on the part of our citizens. In con nection with this subject, I call the atten tion of Congress to t he generally conceded fact that the great proportion of Chinese immigrants who have come to our shores do not come voluntarily, to make their homes with us and their labor productive of general prosperity, but come "under contract with head men who own them almost absolutely. In a worse form does this apply to Chinese women. Hardly a perceptible percentage of them perform any household labor, but they are brought for shametul purposes, to the disgrace of communities where settled, and to the great demoralization of the youth of those localities. If this bad practice can be legislated against, will be my pleasure as well as duty to enforce any regulation to secure so aesiraoie an end. It is hoped that the negotiations be tween the Governments of Japan and the other powers looking to the further open ing oi iuc jcuiirc ana to rne removal oi various restrictions upon trade and travel. may soon produce the results desired, which can not fail to inure to the benefit of all parties. Havingon previous occasions submitted to the consideration of Congress the pro priety of the release of the Japanese Gov ernment from the further payment of indemnity under the convention of Octo ber 29, 1864, and as no action had been taken thereon, it became my duty to to regard the obligations of the conven tion as in force, and as the other powers interested have received their portion of the idemnity in full, the Minister of the United States at Japan has been notified that this Government will receive the remainder due to the United States un der the convention of Simonsky. I sub mit the propriety of applying the income of a part, if not the whole, of this fund to the education in the Japanese language of a number of young men, to be under, obligations to serve the Government for a specified time as interpreters at the Le gation and the Consulates of Japan. A limited number of Japanese youths might at the same time be educated in our ver nacular, and would result advantageously to both Governments, the importance of having our own citizens competent and familiar with the language of Japan, to act as interpreters and in other capacities connected with the Legation and Con sulates in that country, can not readily be overestimated- The amount awarded to the Govern ment of Great Britain by the mixed Com mission organized under the acts of the Treaties of Washington in the settlement of the claims of British subjects arising from acts committed between April 18, 1841, and April 9, 1865, became practica ble under terms of treaty within the past year, and was paid upon the 21st dav of September. '874. In this connection I renew my recommendation made at the opening of the last session ot Congress, that a special Court be erected to hear and determine all claims of aliens against the United States, arising from acts com mitted against their persons or property during the insurrection. It appears equitable that opportunity should be of fered for persons of other States to pre sent their claims as well as to those Brit ish subjects whose claims were not admis sible under the claims of the late Com mission, to the early decision of a compe tent tribunal, and I recommend the nec essary legislation to organize a Court to dispose of those claims of aliens who are referred to, in an equitable and satisfac tory manner, and to relieve Congress and the departments from the consideration of these questions. The legislation necessary to extend the colony of New Foundland, certain arti cles of the Treaty of Washington of the 8th day of May, 1871, having been had, a protocol to that effect was suggested in behalf of the United States and Great Britain, on the 29th day of May last, and was duly 'proclaimed on the following day. A copy of the proclamation is sub mitted herewith. j A copy of the report of the Commission i appointed under the act of March 19, 1872, for surveying and marking the boundary between the United States and the British Possessions from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains, is herewith transmitted. I am happy to announce that the field work of the Commission has been completed and the entire line from the northwest corner of the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains has been run and marked upon the surface of the earth. It is believed that the amount remaining unexpended of the appropria tion made at the last session ot Congress will be sufficient to complete the work. I recommend that the authority of Con gress be given to use the unexpended balance of the appropriation in the com pletion of the work of the Commission in making the report and printing the necessary map. The Court known as the Court of Com missioners of the A labama claims, created by an act of Congress the last session has organized and commenced its work, and it is to be hoped that the claims admissi ble under the provisions of the act may be speedily administered ; and it has been deemed advisable to exercise the discre tion conferred upon the Executive at the last session by accepting the conditions required by the Government of Turkey for the privilege of allowing citizens of the United States to hold real estate in the former country, and bv assenting to a certain change of the jurisdiction of the Courts in the latter. A copy of the proclamation upon these subjects is here with communicated. - . There has been no material change in our relations with the independent States. within this hemisphere which were for merly under the dominance of Spain. Marauding on thefrontiers, between Mex ico and Texas, still frequently takes place, despite the vigilance of the civil and military authorities in that quarter. i ne ditnculty of checking such tresspases along the course of a river of such length as the Rio Grande, and so often fordable. is obvious. It is hoped that the efforts of this Government will be seconded by those of Mexico to the effectual suppres sion of acts of wrong. From a report upon the condition of the business before the American and Mexican Joint Claims Commission, made" by the agent on the' part of the United States, and dated Oc tober 28. 1874, it appears that of the 11, 107 claims filed on the part of citizens of the United States,'4S3 had been finally decided and seventy five were in the bands of the umpire, leaving 460 to be disposed of; and of the 998 claims filed against the United States, 726 have been finally decided, and one was before the umpire.and 271 remain to be disposed of. Since the date of such report other claims have been disposed of, reducing somewhat the number still pending, and others have been passed upon by the arbitrators. It has become apparent in view of these fig ures, and of the fact that the work de volving on'the umpire is particularly la borious, that the Commission would be unable to dispose of the entire number of claims pending prior to the 1st day of February, 1855, the date fixed for its ex piration. Negotiations were pending looking to the securing of the results of the decisions which have been reached, and to a further extension of the Commis sion for a limited time, which it is confi dently hoped will suffice to bring all the business now before it to a final close. The strife in the Argentine Republic is to be deplored, both on account of the parties thereto and from the probable effects on the interests of those in the trade to that quarter, of whom the United States, are among the principal. As yet, so far as I am aware, there has been no violation of our neutrality rights, which, as well as our duties in that res pect, it shall be my endeavor to maintain and observe. It is with regret I announce that no further payment has been received from the Government of Venezuela on account of the award in favor of citizens of the United States. Hopes have been enter tained that if the Republic could escape both foreign and civil war for a few years; its great natural resources would enable it to honor its obligations. Though it is now understood to be at peace with other countries, a serious insurrection is re ported to be in progress in an important region oi mat itepuoiic. lhis may be taken advantage of as another reason to delay the payment of the dues of our citizens. The deplorable strife in Cuba contin ued without any marked change in the relative advantages of the contending forces. The insurrection continues, but Spain has gained no superiority. Six years of strife give the insurrection a sig nificance which can not be denied. Its duration and the tenacity of its adher ents, together with the absence of mani fested power of suppression on the part of Spain, can not be controverted, and may make some positive steps on the part of the other Powers a matter ot self necessity. I had confidently hoped. at this time to be able to announce the arrangement of some ot the important questions between this Government and that of Spain, but the negotiations have been protracted. The unhappy intestine dissensions of Spain command our profound sympathy, and must be accepted as, perhaps, a cause of some delay. An early settlement in part, at least, of the questions between the Governments is hoped.' In the meantime, awaiting the results of imme diately pending negotiations, I defer a further and full communication on the subject of the relations of this country and Spain. I have again to call the attention of Congress to the unsatisfactory condition of the existing laws with reference to ex patriation and the election of nationality. Formerly arnid conflicting opinions and decisions it was difficult to exaotly de- termine how far the doctrine of perpetu al allegiance was applicable to citizens of the United states. Congress by the act, of the 27th of July, 1868, asserted the ab stract right of expatriation as a funda mental principle of this Government. Notwithstanding such assertion, and the necessity of the frequent application of the principle, no legislation has been had defining what acts or formalities shall work expatriation, or when a citizen shall be deemed to have renounced or to have lost his citizenship. The importance of such definition is obvious. 1 he repre sentatives ot the U nited states in foreign countries are continually called upon to lend their aid and the protection of the united states to persons concerning the good faith or the reality of whose citizen ship there is at least great question. In some cases the provisions of the treaties furnish some guide, in others it seems left to the persons claiming the benefit ot citizenship, while living in a foreign country, contributing in no manner to the performance of the obligations and duties of a citizen of the United States simply as a shield from the performance ot t je obligations ot citizens elsewhere The status of children born of American parents residing in a foreign country, of American women who have married aliens, of American citizens residing abroad, where such question is not regu lated by treaty, are all sources of fre- buent difficulty and discussion. Legisla tion on these and similar questions, and particularly defining when and under what circumstances expatriation can be accomplished or is to be presumed, is es pecially needed. In this connection I earnestly call the attention of Congress to the difficulties arising from fraudulent naturalization The united States wisely, freely, and liberally offers its citizenship to all who may come in good faith to reside within its limit on their complying with certain prescribed reasonable and simple formal ities and conditions. Among the highest duties of the Government is that to afford firm, efficient and equal protection to all its citizens, whether native born or naturalized. Care should be taken that a right carrying with it such support irom the Government should not be fraudulently obtained, and should be bes towed only upon full proof of a compli ance with the law. There are frequent instances of illegal and fraudulent natu ralization and of the unauthorized use of certificates thus improperly obtained. In some cases the fraudulent character of the naturalization has appeared upon the face of the certificate itself; in others, examination discloses that the holder had not complied with the law, and in others certificates have been obtained where the persons holding fhem not only were not entitled to be naturalized, but had not even been within the United States at the time of the pretended natu ralization. Instances of each of these classes of fraud are discovered at our Le gations, where the certificates of natural ization are presented either for the pur pose of obtaining passports or in demand ing the protection of the Legation. When the fraud is open on the. face of such cer tificates, they are taken up by the repre sentatives of the Government and for warded to the Department of State. But even the record of the Court in which the fraudulent naturalization occurred remains, and duplicate certificates are readily obtainable npon the presenta tion of these, for the issue of passpovts or demanding protection of the Govern ment. The fraud sometimes escapes no tice, and such certificates are not unfre- quently used in transactions of business, to the injury of innocent parties. With out placing any additional obstacle in the way of the obtainment of citizenship by the worthy and well i n tent ion ed foreign er, who comes in good faith, I would earnestly recommend further legislation to punish fraudulent naturalization, and to secure the ready cancellation of the record of every naturalization made in fraud. Since my last annual" message the ex change has been made of the ratification of treaties of extradition with Belgium, Ecuador, Peru, and Salvador; also, of a treaty of commerce and navigation with Peru, and one of commerce and consular privileges with Salvador, all of which have been duly proclaimed, as has also a declaration with Russia, with reference to trade marks. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which by law is made directly to Congress, and forms no part of this message, will show the receipts and ex penditures of the Government for the last fiscal year, the amount received from each source of revenue, and the amount paid out for each of the departments of the Government. If'w'ill be observed from the report that the amount of re ceipts over expendituresVhas 'been but $2,344,882 30 for the fiscal year ending June 10, 1874, and that for the current fiscal year the estimated receipts over expenditures will not. much exceed $9,000,000. In view of the large National debt existing,' and the. obligation to add one per cent, to the sinking fund, a sum amounting now to $34,000,000 per annum. 1 submit whether the revenues should not be increased or expenditures dimin ished to reach this amount of surplus. Not to provide for the sinking fund is a partial failure to comply with the con tracts and obligations of the Govern ment. At the last session of Congress a very considerable reduction was made in the rates of taxation and in the number of articles submitted to taxation : the question may well be asked whether or not in some instances unwisely.. In connection with this subiect, too. is the opinion that the means of collecting the revenue, especially from imports. have been so embarrassed by legislation as to make it questionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure to collect, to the direct loss of the Treas ury and to the prejudice of the interests of honest importers and tax-payers. the secretary ot the treasury, m his report, favors legislation looking to spe cie payments, thus supporting the views previously expressed in this message. He also recommends economy in appro priation, and calls attention to the loss of revenue from repealing the tax on tea and coffee without benefit to the con sumer; recommends an increase of ten cents a gallon on whisky, and further, that no modification be niade in the Banking and Currency Bill, passed at the last session of Congress, unless modifica tion should become necessary by reason of the adoption of measures for return ing to specie payments. In these recom mendations I cordially join. I would suggest to Congress the propriety of re adjusting the tariff, so as to increase the revenue, and at the same time decrease the number of articles upon which duties are levied. Those articles which enter into our manufactures, and are not pro duced at home, it seems to me. should be entered free. Those articles of manu facture which we produce, or a constitu ent part of, but do not produce the whole, that part which we do not pro duce should enter free also, I will in stance fine wool, dyes, &o. These must be imported to form a part of the manu facture of the higher grades of woolen goods, and chemicals used as dyes, com pounded in medicines, and used in vari ous ways in manufactures, come under this class. The introduction, free of dues, of such wools as we do not produce. should stimulate the manufacture ol goods requiring these and those we do produce, and therefore would be a bene fit to home production. There are many articles entering into home marrufac tures which we do not produce ourselves, the tariff upon which increases the cost of producing the manufactured article. All corrections in this regard are in the direction of bringing labor and capital in harmony with each other, and of supply ing one of the elements much needed. The report of the Secretary of War herewith attached and forming a part of this message gives all the informa tion concerning all the operations, wants and necessities, and contains many suggestions and recommendations which I commend to your special atten tion. There is no class of Government employes who are harder worked than the army officers, and none who perform their tasks more cheerfully and more ef ficiently, and under circumstances of greater privations and hardships. Legislation is desirable to render more efficient this branch of the public ser vice. All the recommendations of the Secretary of War I regard as judicious, and 1 especially commend to your atten tion the following : The consolidation of Government arsenal ; mileage to offi cers traveling under orders ; the exemp tion of money received from the sale of subsistence stores from being covered in to the Treasury ; the use of appriations for the purchase of subsistence stores without waiting for the beginning of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made; for additional appriations for the collection of torpedo material; for in creased appopriations for the manufac ture ot arms; tor relieving the various States from indebtedness for arms charg- d to them during the rebellion; for dropping officers from the rolls of the army without trial for the offense of drawing pay more than once for th same period; for the discouragement of the plan to pav soldiers by checks, and for the establishment of a professorship of rhetoric and English literature at West Point. The reasons for the recommendations are obvious, and are set forth sufficiently in the report attached. 1 also recom mend that the status of the staff- corps of the army be fixed where this has not already been done, so that promotions may be made and vacancies filled as they occur in each grade when reduced below the number to be fixed. 1 he necessity for such legislation is specially felt now in the pav department the- number' of vacancies in that department being now below the number adequate to the per formance of the duties required of them by law. The efficiency of the Navy has been largely increased during the last year. under the impulse of the foreign compli cations which threatened us. At J.he commencement of the last session of Congress, most of our efficient wooden Ehips were put in condition for immediate service, and the repairs of our ironclad fleet were pushed with the utmost vigor. The Result is that most of these are now in effective state, and -need only to be manned and but- in commission, to go at once into service. Some of . the new sloops authorized bv Congress are already n commission, and most ot the remain der are launched and want only the com pletion of machinery to enable them to take their places as part of our effective force. Two iron torpedo ships have been completed during the last year, and four of our large double-turreterl iron clads are undergoing repairs.. When these are finished, everything that is needful to the navy, as now authorized, will be in condition for service, and with the ad vance in science af torpedo warfare, the American navy, comparatively small as t is, will be found powerful for the pur poses of a peaceful nation. Much has also been accomplished dur ing the year in aid of science, and to in crease the sum of general knowledge and further the interests of commerce "and civilization. Extensive and much need ed soundings have been made for hydro- graphic purposes, and to fix the proper routes of ocean telegraphs; the surveys of the Great Isthmus have been under taken and completed, and two vessels of the navy are now employed, in conjunc tion with those of England, France, Ger many and Russia, in observations con nected with the transit of Venus, useful and interesting to the scientific world. Estimates for this branch of the public service do not differ materially from those of last year, those for the general support of the service beingrsomewhat less, and those for improvements at the various stations, rather larger than the corresponding estimate made a year ago. The ready maintenance, and a steady in crease in the efficiency of this most im portant arm in proportion to the growth of our maratime intercourse and inter course and interests is recommended to the attention of Congress. The use of the. navy during peace might be further utilized by a direct authorization of the employment of naval vessels in surveys of the supposed navigable waters of oth er nationalities in this continent, espe cially tributaries of the two great rivers of South America, the Orinoco and Ama zon. Nothing prevents under existing aws such exploration, except that ex penditures must be made in such devel opment of commercial interests advan tageous to the people reached and to to those who may establish relations with them. The education of the people entitled to exercise the right of franchise I regard essential to prosperity, everywhere, and especially so in republics, where neither education nor previous condition enters into account in giving suffrage Next to the public school, the Postof- fice is the great agent of education, over our vast territory. The rapidity with which new sections are being settled up, thus increasing the carrying of. mails in a more rapid ratio than the increase of receipt, is not alarming. The report of the Postmaster General, herewith attach ed, shows that there was an increase of revenue in his department in 1873 over the previous year of $1,674,411, and an ncrease ot cost of carrying the mails, or paying employes of $3,041,467.91. 1 he report ot the Postmaster General gives interesting statistics of his depart ment, and compares them with corres ponding statistics of a year ago, showing a growth in every branch of the depart ment A postal convention has been concluded with New South Wales, an ex- hange of postal cards established with Switzerland, and negotiations, pending for several years past with France, has terminated in a convention with that country which went into effect last Au gust. An international Postal Congress was convened in Berno, Switzerland, in September -last, at which the United States was represented by an officer of the Postal Department of much expe rience and of good qualification for the position. A convention for the estab lishment of an International Postal Un ion was agreed upon by the delegates of the countries represented, subject to the approval of the proper, authorities of these countries. I respectfully direct your attention to the report of the Postmaster General, and to his suggestions in regard to an equitable adjustment of the question of compensation to railroads tor carrying mails. Your atention will be drawn to the un settled condition of affairs in some of the Southern States. On the" 14th of Sep tember last, the Governor of Louisiana called upon me, as provided by the con stitution an laws of the United States, for aid in the suppression of domestic violence in that State. The call was made in view of a proclamation issued on that day by D. B. Peen, stating that he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1872, and calling upon the militia of the State to arm, assemble and drive from power the usurpers, as he designated the officers of the State Government. On the next day I issued my proclamation, and commanded the insurgents to dis perse within five days from the date thereof, and on that day they had taken forcible possession of the State House. Steps were taken by me to support the existing recognized State Government; but before the expiration of the five days, the insurrectionary movement was practically abandoned, and the officers of the State Government, with some, minor exceptions, resumed their powers and duties. Considering that the present State Ad ministration of Louisiana had been the only government in that State for nearly two years; that it has been tacitly ac knowledged and acquiesced in as such by Congress, and more than once ex pressly recognized by me, I regarded it as my clear duty, when legally called up on for that purpose, to prevent its over throw by an armed mob under pretense ot fraud and irregularity in the election of 1872. 1 have heretofore called the attention of Congress to this subiect, stating that on account of the frauds and forgeries committed at said election, and because it appears that the returns thereof were never legally canvassed, it was imposs ble to tell thereby who was chosen : but. trom the best sources of information at my command, I have always believed the present state officers received a majority or tho legal votes actually cast at , that election. 1 repeat what 1 said in mv special message of February 13, 1873,that in the event ot no action of Congress luust cuutiuue iu recognize trie govern nient neretoiore recognized by me. regret to say that with preparations ior me late elections a decided indica lion appeared in some localities in the southern States, ot a determination, by acts or violence and intimidation, to de prive citizens of the freedom of the bal lot because, of their political opinions. uanas or men masked and armed made tneir appearance. White Leagues and other societies were formed, large, quan ..wo Ui nns ana amumtion were lmpor ed.and distributed to these organizations." Military drills with menacing demonstra tions were held, and with all these, mur ders enough were committed to spread terror among those whose political action was to be suppressed, if possible, bv these intolerant and criminal proceedings, in some places colored laborers were com pelled to vote according to the wishes of their employers, under threats of dis charge if they acted otherwise, and there are too many instances in which, when these threats were disregarded, they were re"morselessly executed by those by whom thev were made., , I understand that the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution was made to prevent this like state of things, and the act "of May 31, 1870, with amendments, was passed to enforce its provision, the object of this being to guarantee to all citizens the right to vote and to protect them in ' the free enjoyment of the right enjoined by the constitution, to take care . that the laws be faithfully'Texecnted ; and conr vinced bv undoubted evidence that vio lations of said act has been committed. and that a widespread and flagrant disre gard of it was contemplated, the proper officers were instructed to prosecute the offenders, and troops were, stationed at convenient points to aid these officers, if necessary, in the performance of their official duties. Complaints are made of this interference bv Federal authority. but if said amendment and act do not provide for such interference under the. circumstances as above stated, then they are without meaning, force or effect, and the whole scheme of colored enfranchise ment is worse than mockery and little better than a crime. Possibly Congress may find it due to truth and justice to ascertain, by means of a committee, whether the alleged wrongs to: colored citizens for political purposes were real or the reports thereof were manufactured for the occasion. The whole number of troops in the States of Louisiana, Ala bama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Maryland and Vir ginia, at. the times of election, were 4,082. This embraces the garrisons of all the forts from the Delaware to the Gulf of Mexico. adoption should be ratified by a majority of those affected. The report of the Secretary of the In terior, herewith attached, gives much in teresting statistical information, which I abstain from giving an abstract of, but refer you to the report itself. The act of Congress providing the oath which pensioners must subscribe before drawing their pensions cuts off from this bounty a few survivors of the war of 1812, residing in the Southern States. I recommend the restoration of this bounty to all such. The number of persons whose names would be restored to the list of pensions is not large. They are all old pensioners, who could have taken no part in the rebellion; and the services for which they were awarded pensions were in defense of the whole country. The report of the Commissioner of Ag riculture, herewith, contains suggestions of much interest to the general public, and refers to the approaching Centennial, and the part his department is ready to take in it. I feel that the Nation at large is interested in having this exposi tion a success, and commend to Congress such action as will secure a greater gen eral interest in it. Already many foreign Nations have signified their inten tion to be represented at it. It may be expected that every civilized Nation will be represented. The rules adopted to improve the civil service of the Government have been ad hered to as closely as has been practicable with the opposition with which they meet. The effect.I believe has been beneficial on the whole, and has tended to the elevation of the service, but it is impracticable to maintain them without the direct and positive support of Congress. Generally the support which this reform receives is from those who give it their support only to find fault when tho rules are ap parently departed from.-, Removals from office without preferring charges against the parties removed, are frequently cited as departures from the rules adopted, and the retention of those against whom charges are made by irresponsible per sons and without good grounds is also condemned as a violution of them. Un der these circumstances, therefore, I an nounce that if Congress adjourns with out positive legislation on the subject of civil servioe reform, I will regard such action as a disapproval of the system, and will abandon it. Except so far as to require examination for' certain ap pointees, to determine their fitness, com petitive examinations will be abandoned The gentlemen, who have given their ser vices without compensation, as members ot the .Board, to devise rules and reguia tions for the government of the civil ser vice of the country, have shown much zeal and earnestness in the work, and to them, as well as to myself, it will be source of mortification if it is to be thrown away. But 1 repeat that it is impossible to carry this system to a sue cessful issue without general approval and assistance, and a positive law to sup port it. , I have -stated that the elements of prosperity to the Nation's capital and labor, skilled and untrained, and pro ducts of the soil, still remain with us To direct the employment ol this is problem deserving the most serious at tention of Congress. If employment can be given to all labor ottering itself,- pros perity necessarily follows. 1 have ex pressed the opinion, and repeat it, that the first requisite to the accomplishmen of this end is the substitution of a sound currency in place of one of a fluctuating value.1 This secured, there are many in terests that might be fostered, to the great profit of both labor and capital. IIow to" iriduce'capital to employ labor is the question. The subject ot transpor tation has occupied the attention ol Con gress. - New light on this question will without doubt, be given the committee appointed bv the last Congress to inves tigate and report upon the subject. A revival of ship building, and partic ularly of iron steamship-building, is of vast importance to our national prosper! ty. The United States is now paying over $1,000,000,000 per annum ior freights and passage on toreign ships to be car ried abroad and expended in the em ployment and support of other people, beyond a fair percentage of what should go to foreign vessels, estimating on; the tunnage and travel of each respectively. It is to be regretted that ihis disparity in the carrying trade exists, and to cor rect it I would be willing.to see a great departure from the usual course of the Government in supporting what might be usually termed private enterprise. 1 would suggest as a remedy direct subsidy to American steamship lines, but I would suggest the direct offer of ample compen sation for carrying the mails between At- 1 . : - i i i a v. . , : ittijwu uuu seauoaru cimbs auu tuo uuuu nent on American owned and American built steamers, and would .extend this liberality to vessels earrying the mails to the South American States,' and to Cen tral America and Mexico, , and would pursue the same policy from pur Pacific seaports to foreign seapprts oh the Pa cific. It might be demanded that ves sels built for this servioe should come up to a standard. .fixed by legislation, tun nage and speed and all other , qualities looking to the possibility of the Govern ment requiring them at some timelor war purposes. The right alsoof' taking possession of --them-- in - such emergency should be guarded. I offer those sugges tions, believing them Worthy ot consider ation, in all seriousness, affecting all sec tions and all interests alike. It anything better can be done to.direct the country into a course of general prosperity no one will be more ready than I to adopt this plan. - ' .' -, Forwarded herewith is the plan and report of the Commissioners appointed under the Act ol Congress, approved June 20, 1874, to wind up the affairs of the Dis trict Urovernment. It will be seen from the report that the total debt of the Dis trict of Columbia, less assets on hand and available, as bonded debt issued prior to July:2, 1874, $8,S83,940 43, 3 65 bonds. Act of Congi-ess, June 20, 1874, $2,088, 168 73, Certificates of the Board of Audit $4,770,558 45, total $15,742,667 61; less special improvi-meutassesment3 chargea ble to private property in excess ot any demand against assessment $164,054 37,' less Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Bonds $75,000, and Washington and Alexandria Bonds $59,0000, in the hands of the Com missioners ef the Sinking Fund $1,648,- 054 37, leaving an actual debt, less said fund, of $13,994, 613 24. In addition to this there are claims preferred against the Board of the District, amounting in the aggregate, reported by the Board of Audit, $3,147,787 48, of which a greater part will probably be rejected. This sum can with no more propriety be included n the debt of the District Government can be included as a portion of the Na tional debt, but. the. aggregate sum thus stated includes something more than the funded debt chargeable exclusively to the District of Columbia. Another trouble has arisen in Arkan sas. Article 13 of the Constitution of the State, -which was adopted in 1868, and upon the approval of which by Congress the state was restored to representation as one of the States of the Union, pro vides in effect that before any amend ment proposed to the Constitution shall become a part thereof, they shall be" passed by two successive Assemblies, and then submitted to and ratified by a ma- ority of the electors of the State voting therein. On the 11th of May, 1874, the Governor convened an extra session of the General Assembly of the State; which. on the 18th of the same month, passed an act providing for a Convention to frame a new Constitution. Pursuant to this act, and at an election held on the 30th of June, 1874, the Convention was approved, and delegates were chosen thereto, who assembled on the 14th of ast July and formed a new Constitution. the schedule of which provided for the election of an entire new set of State offi cers, in a manner contrary to the then existing election laws of the State. On the 13th of October, 1S74, this Constitu- ion, as therein provided, was submitted to the people for their approval or rejec tion, and -according to the election re turns was approved bv a large maioritv of those qualified to vote thereon, and at the same election persons were chosen to fill all the State, county and townshin offices The Governor elected in 1S72 for the term of four years, turned over his office to the Governor chosen under the new Constitution, whereupon the Lieutenant Governor, also elected in 1872 for a term of four years, claiming to act as Governor and alleging that such proceedings by which the new Constitution was made and a new set of officers elected, were un constitutional, illegal and void, called upon me as provided in Section 4 of the constitution, to protect the State against domestic violence. As Congress is now nvestigating the political affairs of Ar kansas, 1 have declined to interfere with the subject. Executive interference with th affairs of a State is repugnant to public opinion, to the. feeling of those who trom their official capacity, must be used in such interposition, and to him or those who must direct it. Unless most clearly on the side of the law such nterterence becomes a orime. With the aw to support it, it is condemned with out a hearing. I desire, therefore, that all necessity for executive direction in local affairs may become unnecessary and obsolete. I invite the attention not only of Con gress, but of the people of the United States, o the onuses and effects of these unhappy questions. Is there not a dis position on one side to magnify wrongs and outrages, and on the other side to belittle them or justify them?1 If public opinion could be directed to a correct survey of what is, and to rebuking wrong and aiding the proper authorities in pun ishing it, a better state of feeling would be inculcated, and the sooner we would have that peace which would leave the States free indeed to regulate their own domestic affairs. I believe on the part of our citizens of the Southern States the better part of them there is a dis position to be law-abiding, and to do no violence, either to individuals or the laws existing; but do they do right in ig noring the existence of violence and bloodshed in resistance to constituted, authority? I sympathize with their prostrate condition, and would do all in my power to relieve them, acknowledg ing that in some instances they have had most trying governments to live under, and very oppressive ones in the way of taxation for nominal improvements, not giving benefits equal to the hardships imposed. But can they proclaim them selves entirely excusable for this condi tion ? They can not. Violence has been rampant in some localities, and has, fur ther, been justified or denied by those who could have prevented it. -The theory is raised that there is to'be no more interference on the part of the General Government to protect citizens' ' withm a State where the State authori ties fail to give protection. This is a great mistake. While I remain Execu tive all the laws of Congress and the pro visions of the Constitution, including the amendments added thereto, will be en forced with vigor, with6ut regret that they should have added one jot or tittle to the Executive duties anrl nns t t there be firmness in the rliaa; Southern questions: the advocates of both or all political parties giving honest truthful reports of occurrences, or de nouncing the wrong and upholding the rignt, and soon all will be well. TTr.H existing conditions the negro votes the Republican ticket because he knows his friends are of that narr.v- mm. citizen votes the opposite, not. ho.,f agrees with the great principles of state, which separate parties, but because gen-' erally he. is opposed to negro rule This is a most delusive cry. Treat the negrc as a citizen and voter, as he is. and must.' remain, and soon the parties will be di vided, not on the color line, but on prin ciples Then we shall have no complaint ot sectional interferences. . , ine report of the Attornev.r,,! contains valuable recommendations-relating to the administration of justice in the Courts of the United States, to which t invite your attention r retf.,ii suggest to Congress the r.; creasing the number of Judicial Districts in the United States to eleven, the pres- of twnv-bein,STnine- and the creation of two additional Judgeships.

It is hoped that a few years more will relieve our frontiers of Indian depredations. I commend the recommendations of the Secretary for the extension of the homestead laws to the Indians, and for some sort of territo rial government for the Indian Territory. A great majority of the Indians occupy- " mg this territory are believed to be inca pable of maintaining their rights against the more civilized and enlightened man. Any territorial form of government given them, therefore, should protect them in their homes and property for a period of at least twenty years, and before its final " The act of Congress of November 28, 1874, contemplates an apportionment be tween the United States Government and the District of Columbia in respect of the payment of. the principal and inter est of the 3 65 bonds. Therefore, in com piling with precision the bonded debt of the District, the aggregate sums above stated as respects the 3.65 bonds now is sued, the outstanding certificates of the Board of Credit, and the unadjusted claims pending before that Board, should be reduced to the extent of the amount to be apportioned to the United States Government in the manner indicated in the act of Congress of June 20, 1874. the interest on the District bonds and the consolidation of indebtedness to the Dis trict. I feel much indebted to the gentlemen who consented to leave their private af fairs, and from a distance to attend to the business of this District, and for the able and satisfactory manner in which it has been conducted I arn sure their ser vices will be equally appreciated by the entire country. Tt will be seen from the accompanying full report of the Board of Health, that the sanitary condition of the District is very satisfactory. In my opinion, the District of Columbia should be regarded as the grounds of the National Capital in which the entire people are interested. I do not allude to this to urge general ap propriations to the District, but to draw the attention of Congress in framing a law for the government of the District, to the magnificent scale on which the city was planned by the founders of the Govenrment, the .manner in which, for ornamental purposes, tfie reservations, streets and avenues were laid out, and the proportion of the. property actually possessed by the General Government. " I think the proportion of the expenses of the Government, and improvements, to be borne by the General Government, the cities of Washington and George town. and the country, should be careful ly and equitably defined. In accordance with Section 3 of the act approved June 23, 1S74, I appointed a board to make a survey of the mouth of the Mississippi River, .with a view to determine the best method of obtaining and maintaining a depth of water suffi cient for the purposes of commerce, etc., and in accordance with on act entitled "An act to provide for the appointment of a commission of engineers - to inves tigate and report a permanent plan for the excavation of the alluvial basin of the Mississippi River subject to inunda tion."
