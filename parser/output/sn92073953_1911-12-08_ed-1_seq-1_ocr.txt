RESIDENT'S MESSAGE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS-LAUDS ARBITRATION TREATIES AND DEPLORES TALIAN TURKISH WAR . Washington, D. C, Dec. 7. Peace is the keynote of President Taft's message on foreign, relations, which was sent to Congress today. After calling attention to the fact that the United States is at present on the most cordial terms with all the oth er world powers. President Taft lauds the arbitration treaties, which this country has negotiated with France and Great Britian and expresses the sincere hope that the- Senate will ratify them at once. Upon the topic of "Arbitration,' the President has the following to Kay: "The year .just passed marks an important general movement on tie part of the Powers for broader arbitration. In the recognition of the laanifold benefits to mankind in the extension of the policy of the settle- taent of international disputes by ar- bitration rather than by war and In TMnnnoo t Q wirto snrMd Hfimand for a advance in that direction on the part of the people of the United States and of Great Britain and of Tvonno th tprms of which were de- signed, as expressed in the preample 4riaa n Ovton,i th scone and obligations of the policy ofar- bitrations adopted in our present ilh thpsf! erovernments. To I tho v for this t.reatv with ttt,uoH stat-- Grat Britain nego- 4v?an imnnrtiint inndiflcation in its alliance with Japan, and the French government also expedited the nego- Satioiis-with signal good will. The new treaties have been submitted to xv. a oiH.r Uo jifi- vice and consent to their ratification. AH the essentials of these important treaties have long been known and it is my earnest hope that they wi receive prompt and favorable action.' The message contains the first of ficial explanation of the movement of -tritL Qtafoc trnnns alone the Mex-1 iMn tmnlAr at the' time of the Mad ero revolution in Mexico. The Pres ident stated that advices from Henry Lane Wilson, United States Ambassa- dor at Mexico City, indicated that the situation in Mexico was much graver than press dispatches implied. Fear- ing for the lives of the 40,000 Amer- icans in Mexico, Mr. Taft "took i pnnd deal of responsibility," as Ik ybrased it, and ordered out the sol- J diers and war ships. At the same i time President Taft notified President j TMa of Mexico, that no alarm need I be felt as the troops were to be used I -wily to enforce neutrality and to pre- J vent the shipment of arms across tneitneir nomes. Rio Grande from the American side I The greater part of Southern China "It seemed my duty," said Mr. Taft - "to But troops where, if Congress har directed that they enter Mexico, ef-1 fective movement could have been I made promptly." I President Taft declared that the j presence of the troops had a good ef- J feet. He further explained that the I restraint of the United States gov- ernment, oven after casualties had resulted from bullets fired aci-oss the international line, was not due to a lack of force but a desire to avoid intervention. . v The friendship of the United States with Mexico is now closer than ever, the message says. Touching upon the anti-Madero' revolution, inaugurated by' Gen Bernardo Reyes, who was ar- rested by the Federal authorities for Blnttine an insurrection against a friendly power on United States soil, the President declared that this coun try was merely following out a policy of respecting the contemporaneous recognized constitutional authority in Mexico. President Taft also voiced his plea sure that war had been probably averted by the United States in act ing as mediator in- a boundry dispute i-.x TT.sij .1 Cantn TVaninero r.rp,:; Panama The message : touches lightly upon the revolution in China, in reference, 4 , nr.MA Tiatmction and currency reform in which American hard struggle.

The message deplores the war be tween Italy and Turkey but it was with satisfaction that Mr. Taft ex called attention to the fact that it could in no wise embroil the United States. Attention is called to the work of the opium commission now sitting at the Hague which Is trying to c. traffic in dangerous drugs and it is pointed out that the trade of, the United States is constantly growing. Exports of the United States, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, were over $2,000,000,000, a gain of $300, "000,000 over those of the previous year. President Taft says there is a cry ing need for an American merchant marine and again asks Congress to grant a subsidy that a merchant ma rine service may be built up. " Broke It Up Here. Lynchburg, Va., Dec. 7. L. C. Ar thur, a planter, while returning home from marketing a load of tobacco here yesterday was held up and robbed by two masked men when about five miles from the city. After taking $14C from Arthur the highwaymen told him to drTve fast, and when he started four shots were fired at him. Arthur thinks the men were negroes. Later the highwaymen were trailed by blood hounds to the street car terminus and it is evident they were Lynchburg negroes.

He told of many places where decided improvement was due entirely to the building of good roads which were before almost impassible. Good roads were iollowea by im provements in business, educational. religion, etc., both in the city end in rural districts. Before he ended !is talks he had convinced everyone present not only of the advantige, but the necessity of good road . Immediately after the lecture, a number oi . stereopti om views were thrown upon the canvr.s of roads in every section of-the United States, before and after improving, each pic ture telling a story of the way ' in which the respective communities were benefitted. The I speaker at the same time told a short but interest ing story of each picture. In reference to the building of good roads in this section the speak er stated that they could be built and kept in good order in this sec tion at less expense than in any oth er section of the state. He stated further that it was not necessary to build macadam .roads that sand clay roads would give the same service and that it would . be ja matter of-going only a few steps from the road to secure the material Af ter they were built, he said, all that would be necessary would be to keep them in order with the split-Jog drag, and that the cost of the up keep would be only a trifle. As a general rule, sand clay roads are built on sandy foundations and tt is the usual practice to put the clay on the unimproved foundation but better results will be obtained if the sandy foundation ig" given a slight crown. This makes the center from four to six inches higher than the side ditches. If this is not done, more clay will be necessary to give the road the needed crown and that is expen sive, especially if the material has to be hauled a considerable distance The process is as follows: The road is covered with from four o six inches of clay and worked with a - disk or tooth harrow until thoroughly mixed, first dry and -fi nally wet. The final mixing should be done, if possible, during rainy weather. When the mixing has been done, the surface is brought to crown with the road machine or split log drag and covered with a thin lay er of sand. After two or three rains it may be necessary to apply anoth er sand coat. This method produces a smooth, cheap and satisfactory road suitable for light traffic. Similar results can be obtained by adding sand to a clay road and pro viding good surface drainage. When building a good clay foundation, it is advisable to plow the clay before add ing the sand in-order to insure a1 thorough mixing. After these had been shown and explained the entire assembly was invited to the demonstration cars, and almost every man in the houso went where the various models were shown, all of them being operated by electricity generated by a gasoline engine in the baggage car. Owing to the fact that the views were shown in the theatre, the sterop- ticon car was not used and the crowd next assembled to the demonstrating ar. where the various models of ma chinery and roads were explained ful ly. To-see these tiny machines running doing the same work that the larger ones do, only on a smaller scale, was to thif car was well worth com exceedingly interesting and the visit to this one car was well worth com ing miles to see.
