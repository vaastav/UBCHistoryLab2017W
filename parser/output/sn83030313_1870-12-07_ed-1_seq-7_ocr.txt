Tho news published in this morning's JBkualo, *s well as the letters from our cor respondent In Rio Janeiro published yester day, show that the state of affairs In tho Argentine and Uruguay republics is most turbnlent. Whllo tho Argentine rebels ^eonflno their operations to the Bntre Rlos, a State compar t tiv-dy isolated from the rest of the confederation by reason of its location, the Uruguayan revolutionists have proven so suc cessful I>i th.'ir opposition to the national troops that they have raarohed up to the very walls of Montevideo and completely invested It. Another dissimilarity also presents itself in tho aspect o; tho r .volutions at present going on in t-io two countries. From the report of tho Argentine General Ilivas, which was l" \ published in yesterdiy's 

HEHALD, it. I" - will b3 seen that th-i Entre Rios rebels were defeated in tho battle of Santa Rosa, which occurred on tho 12th of October. Thoug'i bj iten, however, the rebels oxhibiied a degree of d:tenniiation which, directed as Jt was with const 1 ruble skill, proves them to be enemies not to b ? despised. Th-ir army is Still pro^orvel, and though it is somewhat roluced by Uhjase, desertion and the inevi table destruction w.ilch war entails, it is still !n a condition to disturb the peace of tho State and embarrasi tli ? a lminlatratiou of law and order. The Uruguayan government has been by no means ua succe.uful, The whole re public suffers. Tho bold movements of the rebels, the ability with which their generals planned thoir d jaigns, and the ability with which these designs were executed have completely puzzled tho commanders of the national forcos. The capital of th ? republic Is surrounded with an armed foe, and though that foe is ineffi ciently supplied with arms and is deficient In many respects, fear prevails that the ci'v will have to surrender and the government be obliged to make tho best terras it can with t' the eneinl-'B of the nation. It will thus bo seen p that two of tie SjuLh American republics, , possessing within themselves rich mines ot wealth, are embarrassed aud impoverished by ^ reason of the treason of their own citizens. Tho3o revolutions aro the curse of the South American cou >trio3. Happily Peru, Chile and Bolivia are uwaking to this f.tct, and those periodical revolutions are fast dying out within their limits. The increasing pros perity of tho Argentino republic leads us to hopo that that country too will be relieved of the difficulties which now perplex but do not - delay its progress. Uruguay and Paraguay must also join ia tho prosperous movement of peaee. We look for such an event as the re sult of the labors of science, commerce ami Indnslry now going forward throughout the whole Continent of South America. " Opera DouOb and itio French Nation. Offenbach, though not a Frenchman by race, ts one by nature. In Lis optraa bouffcx he has hit tbo taate and reflectod the character of the French ? .hat is, the French of Paris and the other cities of Franca ? and to a great extent the French everywhere. These op/rax bouffes are gay, light, sensual and frivolous and are made attractive by the refinement of art in tnusic and the spectacle. The immorality and demoralising influence were hidden in part, as ihe vicc of Paris has always b;?en, by a sort of fay and refined abandon. Thus the grossncsa and bad effects are lost sight of in a great measure except to minds of a thoughtful and serious turn. But apart from tho sparkling music how frivolous and trashy is tha opera bouffe. Take, for instance, "Les Brigands," now performed at tho Fisk Opera House. What a mass of nonsense! In place of wit or genuine humor there is nothing but monkey like grinuce3 and contortions, and these very much overdone, to catch the applause of silly young men and sensual "old boys." It is (he veriest childishness, without the freshness, simplicity and origi Dality pertaining to children. It is not a whit better lhan, if as good as, the monkey shows Jn tho streets. Wo are happy to say that not many American ladbs attend these specta cles. The audiences are composed mostly of gay youths and "old boys." These Optra > * bouffes are imported from France, where they became popular, and have had a brief run bere with the cosmopolitan population of our city, but they are neither indigenous nor adapted to America. Indeed, we should bo sorry to think they could become a permanent amusement to our people. But the poi it we would make is, how can a nation which is "pleased with a rattle and tickled with a straw" maintain its position in this practical an J earnest age of tbo world? A nation, the most striking characteristics of which are frivolity and sensuality, however these may be covered up by art or a species of refinement, must fall back before tho more Be rlous, practical and earnest nations. Opera bouffe , either in the theatres or In political and social life, is not in accordance with the spirit of the age and can only be shortlived. The Emperor Louis Napoleon was the master and greatest actor of oplra bouffo in political affairs. Ho was always acting a part, and rarely ingenuous, truthful or honest in what he Baid or did. His fall was the consequence. The republican provisional government of France, though much more in earnest, and having good reason to be so, is following to some extent his example. In placo of truth, sincerity and looking at the stern facts before it directly in the face, wa see a great deal of gasconading, pretence nnd deception. This is, in fact, a sort of op ra bouffe in war, though divested of much of the silly frivolity of what is seen in the theatre. Need we wonder, then, that tho French have been overcome by tho blunt, earnest, sober nnd practical Germans ? None admire tho courage, fine taste, artistic skill, refinement, scientific achievements and theo retic progressive ideas of the French more than wo do. Indeed, we should regard the disruption of this nation, which possesses so many fine qualities ? qualities so useful to our modern civilization ? as a great misfortune to the world. Nor can we look upon tho relent less and unnecessary war of monarchical ? Pruss-a upon tho nascent republic of Franco without reprobation. Still it is evident that tho character of the French must b?corao modified and improved ? muBt become less frivolous, more moral, earnest and practical, or Franoa cannot maintain the position it has held anions the nations of the world. May we not hopo that the dreadful lcsaonB that unhappy country U receiving may instruct the people and improve their character? T'aere is in them and their country every element of a great nation. It only remains to discard opfra bouff * in social life. In politics, in war and in everything els? and to become earnest and practical in accordance with the spirit and progress of the age. Popular Lkotubes. ? The lecture season opens as briskly as if New York and not Boston had claimed to be trio intellectual "hub of the universe." At Asseciation Hall Jebn G. Saxe lectured, Monday evening, on "Yankeo Land," and Kate Field, last evoning, on "Dickens;" Professor Dorcmus will deliver, Thursday evening, the sccond of his lectures on the "Triumphs of Modern Scienco," and Professor Flint, Friday evening, tho second of his on "Physiology." Rev. Dr. Poitej lectured, Monday evening1, at St. Auri's church, on '-The Tyranny of Respectability," and Horace Greeley wan announced to read a paper on "The American Desert," last even ing, in the library of tho New York Historical Society. Tc-night Olive Lo.^an will lecfurc on "Th-.> Bright Side," at Steinway Hall. Perhaps tho most encouraging feature of our newly opened lecture soasou is that Fciontiflc lectures? like those of Professors Doremns and Flint ? prove to be very properly classed among popular lectures. Tee Coal Miners' Stuike.? Bjtweon thirty and forty thousand miners, at Scranton, Pa., have struck against a proposed reduction of their wages, and havvi ceased work. They refuse all compromise, and m'ning operations have consequently ceased. Even if the str.ke has not baen originated for tho purpose of "bulling" coal, tho managers of tho coal mines are likely tu foster it f;rlh,?t purpose. The winter bids fair, through tho merciful dispensation of Providence, to bj unusually mild, and the poor, cons qucntly, aro not likely to sufTer so much by su?h an ill-timed "bulliug" operation, nor 13 the price 0 i' coal likely to ri je to such a fabuiou3 pri,n as the purveyors of the strike evidently intended. Haytten Rki*out of Dominican T roubles. ? It is nothing new for u* to receive reports of the troubles in St. Domingo, and there is certainly nothing surprising that at this particular tlmo we should be informed from Haytica sources that the province of Cibao is in arms against Bacz. It may bo so ? and what if it is? The greater tho necessity of annexation. Tuo United States can give to the Dominican people a good stable government, one which will make tho Island and the people prosperous. This is moro than either President Baez or Cabral and his clique can give, with all their patriotism. Personal Intelligence.

The papers this morning, commenting ou tho President's message, say, in reference to the enforce ment of Canadian rights in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, that Tho President, does not foand his objections against tin action of our government upon the seizure of vessels actually ensured iu fishing within tnc forbidden boundaries, but on seizures hud exami nations of vessels suspeute.l of design to violate the regulations or the Canadian j-"V( muiont. He states tna. while the Canadian act permits of such seizures and examinations the law has not yet been put in f .rce, and he is lesoived to postpone action until an actual offence has been given. \\ hether such seizures ami examinations form a neces sary part of the police duty or our navy is a question for tho government to consider. Wo need ba.dlv say, however, that if these proceedings are necessary to the driving out of in truders upon our waters the law ought to be en forced, whatever objections may be mude by the American government. The threats of rc'aliatlou ! whicn the President holds out that Canadian ves sels will oe refused admis.s.on into Aruei'ican ports, ? and that the bonded system, as it is called, und'-r I winch Canadian merchandise passes through the j United tates, is to be suspended, will not have the si ghtest effect iu preventing the assertion or me ! just rignts of Cauada In the waters of the uutr. Tae ! number of Canadian vessels entering American ports Is quite insignulcant. The stoppage of the bonding system nnghc cau&e tjnniu inconvenience to individuals In Canada, but it would enormouiy benetlt other i>artie.i; unci tho chief injury would fall upon the American transportation lines. President Grant may try these measures of coercion whenever lio likes. He will not cause tho people of Canada to abate their claims one Jot. or title, 'lite President asserts the right of the United Mates to the free navigation of the til. Lawrence. It is hardly worth wane to dis pute this claim. Whatever riglus too American peoplo may poshshs to the navigation of t lie river | they certainly liavo none to the canals along us bank*. Whenever a request has Been made to per mit the passage oi an American vessel down the river it has always been granted, and trio President can hardly allege, therefore, that the eight States on the lakes, of which lie makes m) much, liava been seriously Injured by a denial of his claim. It Is in coining up ilio river, we beg to lniorin ins Ex cellency, that the trouble arises. Perhaps ho lias never made the trip from Kingston to Montreal. We assure hltn that without the use of our cunais the Americans would obtain wonderfully little ad vantage from the free navigation of tho tst. Law rence. An American Fishing Srhuoncr Forfeited.
