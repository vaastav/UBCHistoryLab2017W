Oo kbe nt iij of tbe present teoiion of Con. greu, December 1, Mr. Cox, of Ohio, Intro daoed Into the Home a preamble and resolution which bare beea published In this paper, con demning the arreot and ImpiieonmeLt :t citizsni 

WHITE MEN out of the jurisdiction of tbe State of their reiidence, in which States there . was 00 inmrrection or rebellion or prelenae thereof, and demanding that inch arrest shall hereafter eeaee. On motion of Mr. Colfax, Abolitionist, of Indiana, the preamble and res olution were laid on tbe table bj a rote of 80 Io40. On tbe same day, Mr. Richardson, of Illi nois, offered in the House ft resolution reqoeet . . ' ing the President to inform tbe House what citinns 

WHITE MEN of Illinois erenow confined in prisons ont of that btate, tbe charges ' against ibetn, end where and by whose author ity they were arrested. Mr. Lotij, Aboil' tioniat, of Illinois, stored to lay the resolution 00 the table, which was carried by ft rote of 74 to 40 On the stcsnd day of the session, December S, Mr. Powru., of Kentucky, offered in the Senate ft resolution respecting the arret t and - Uylionmrol oU!bm WiHTB MBN of - Kentucky, outside of tbe State, similar to that offered in the House the day before by Mr. RicHAaDHn. Mr. Wilson, AbolitioniBt, of Massachusetts, objected to tbe present oonsider tion of Mr. Powell's resolution, and it was laid orsr nnder tbe rules Mr. Powell also on tbe same day offered In the Senate a joiLt resolution respeo.ing the ar rest end Imprisonment out of the States ol their r residence, of citizens 

WHITE MEN, similar to that effsred In the House by Mr. Cox on the first day of the session. Mr. Collamei, Aboil tiooist, of Vermont, demanded that the reeolu tion lie orer, end it did lie orer nnder the rules. On the third day of tbe session, December 3, Mr. SADLfioar, of Delaware, tffared in tbe Senate, ft resolution directing the Secrtttry of War to Inform the Senate whether Dr. John Laui and Whitilt Meredith, citlsens WHITE MEN J of tbe State of Delaware, or either of them, hare been arrested and confined in Fort Delaware, the time of tbe arrest and imprisonment, the obarges against them, and by whose orders they were arrested. Mr. Feb senden, of Maine, and Mr. Claix, of New Hampshire, Abolitionists, both called out simultaneously as soon as the resolution was read: "Let it lie orer!" Objection being made, it did lie orer. On the same day, Mr. Scmnxk, Abolitionist, Of Massachusetts, offered in the Senate ft reso lution requesting tbe Secretary ol War to fur. ' Blah the Senate any information which he might possess with reference to tbe sale into alarery of free men BLACK MEN captured or seised ' 7 by the rebel forces, and state what steps bare y been taken to redress this outrage upon human rights. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded Is oonsider the resolution, and it was Adopted. . . - A stranger, on looking orer these proceedings, would naturally ask: "Is Ibis, as I hare been told, country inhabited ebitfly by white men witb Government founded by white men for white men?" He could hardly aroid tbe con . . elusion that. If such was ef er understood to be the oase, the fact was now quite lost sight of or forgotten. Here he sees National Legislature ftdministeriog the most Important branch of the Government for tbe whole country, jet paaeio; try with seeming. If not real indifference the lo r tereste of whit men sod sttending with alacrity to those ef black men. We raise) at this time no objection to the resolution offered by Mr. Bojmes and immedl- fttely adopted by the Senate. Its object was to obtain information in regard to the liberty and personal safety of certain black men. But .l What a contrast Is exhibited In the Senate and In the House when the libeity and personal safety of white men are drawn in question .,: Then, nil inquiry must be postponed, end not area present discussion allowed. , Verily, white men are, with the Abolition majority in tbe present Congress, at a low rale of discount ftnd negroes ftt ft high premium. in of of is is ' of co-operation the all end The Treasury Report.

Military The One Hundredth Ohio—It. Military Policy in regard to the Slavery Question. The Ooe Hundredth Ohio, Colonel John C Gboom, of this olty, Is now encamped near Lx- ' iDgton, Kentucky, under tbe direction of its '(allant Colonel, seconded by Ite other able offi cers, tbe regiment le rapidly Improving la dls . oipllne, and preparing for actlre end efficient ! serrice in (he field. Beside tbe different reci tations in the schools for the instruction of com missioned and non-commissioned officers, the regiment is eogaged In drilling from six to eight bours daily. Tbe Ooe Hundredth Ohio is attached to the Division commanded br General Q- A. Gil- mors. General Gilmore stands high as an offl cor and a eentleinnn. He is an Obioan, and is the distinguished Eosineer who made the prep laratloDS for the reduotion of Fort Pulaski, end obtained his Brigadier Generalship as a reward for meritorioue military seirloes. Tbe officers and men in his oommand unite in hi praise. Under him and led by their gallant Colonel, we shall expect to bear good report from IheofB cers and men of tbe One Hundredth Ohio. Lml oltissns of Kentucky are resorting to tbe olril tribunals of the Sttte and suing out writ 1 of replevin for the recovery of their fugl tire slaves. Many of these slaves are found our militarv camos. Col. Groom, when the suhleot was practically presented to bim, adopt ed tbe following course in regaid to this vexed "contraband" question a line of policy wbloh we understand, bas been also adopted by Gen, Gilmorr: When an officer from a civil court, comes within the lines of Cot. Groom's camp for the purpose of taking an alleged slavp, on a of replevin, from ols of the officers of bis command, who bas euoh alUgel sUve la his employ as a eirvnt, (he Colonel has been guided by tbe following rules, and bas, when called on for advioe or counsel, given the same tihls officers: 1st. He assumes that Kentucky is a loyal State; that she Is fully represented in the Con gress of tbe United States; that martial law has not been declared there, end that, therefore the civil process of the Sttte ie above the mill tary, and the military subdeivient to the civil power. 21. That he bas no right to resist tbe exer else and execution of any civil process properly issued by competent authority. 3 J- That the effi :ers and men under his com mand set np no claim to any right ol proper or interest of aw kind in any kUve witbia tbe lines oi their cimp 4;b. That if sny mch prep ry as t't de scribed in the writ of replevin Is within their camp, they are not awaro of it. Sth. That if the oivil officer finds any such property, be must take his own mode of secur ing it without any assistance from the officers or men in the camp- Gib. That if tbe civil officer does fLd fuch property within tbe camp, tbe Colonel will not deliver it to hlm4or permit it to be done by any one nnder bis command; nor will he permit the civil offioer to be interfered with while in th nroner exercise or discharge 'ol his ifficia duties. 7th. No negro will be turned out of the camp for the purpose of enabling bis master, an officer or other person to get possession of bim. Col. Groom baa also rr quested the officers under his command Dot to give employment to an escaped slave, wben tbe fact is established that he is tbe slave of a loyal master. It is stated that they have all acquiesced most heartily, and Indorsed tbe policy. The Cleveland Herald and Parson Brownlow. Tbe Cleveland Herald ought to be ashamed of itself. In its issue of Monday, it has the unblushing effrontery to reproduce a portioa of ooe of Parson Brownlow's old eleotioset ring let ters, which charges tbe Democracy of the loyal States wl;h "treason," and ft willingness to surrender to Jsrr. Davis, and all that sort of thing! Tbe editor of the Herald knows very ell, that the old Parson took it all back when he was at Nashville a short time ago, and vol unteered to testify to the loyalty and patriotic devotion to the country of the whole people 0 the North. When Brcwnlow bimeelt admits that be lied about tbe Democratic party, and retrao s all that he said derogatory to it, we submit whether the Herald Is not gu l .y of a rery dishonorable ao, in reptintiog the false hoods of the dirty old libeler, who bas been coining money out of the torrible t mictions which we are now called upon to endure as a people! Does the Herald see it 7 For Auditor of State. The following letter comes to ns from a prominent and influential Democrat of Logan county, and speaks for itself :

Tbe negroes are becoming insolent and aba- In localities where Abolitionism ha thrown them among the people in considerable num bers, linos the beginning of this war. They thick at Gallipot!, and are literally prey oponi tho oitlsene of that goodly town Tbey frequently get op rows snd fights, which la cell 1 sometimes result In bloodshed. Tne Ditpatck of ft recent date gives tbe following account of one of these negro rows, whloh occurred at Gallipot' ehorl lime On Monday last the feeling ftlmost culmtna ted In a general denning out of the negroes by the soldiers. It appears that at a grocery, kept by a white man, some three or four Mi dlers got into a row with some daikeys, and Orderly Little, of Captain Leaper'e company, who was at ft blacktmllh shop not very far dls. tant, bearing of it prooeeded to the place to atop the difficulty, wben a revolver was drawn upon bim by ooe of the negroes. Mr. tittle wrenched the pistol from him, throwing the darkey to the ground, and while pummeilng bim over the bead with It, was shot at by three or four negroes from a bouse, a ball tak ing effsot in his back near tbe right shoulder. Tbe word was passed through town that Mr. Little was killed; the soldiers assembled, and made a clean sweep among tbe liquor establish meuts in that end ol the town, and arrested four negroes, who aro now In Jail, though the gen eral wish among the soldiers was tj hare a lit tle banging doDe on tbe occasion. Tbe negro who shot the Orderly was not to be found, but vengeance deep is threatened, and we under stand rewards amounting to two hundred and fifty dollars are offored by members of the cav alry compAny for Mison, the name of the ne gro by whom Little was shot. Mr. L ttle's wound, though painful, Is not considered daa- geious- MISCELLANEOUS NEWS. There was t heary gJe on the Southern oait on Sunday. It was rery eerere near Foilresi Monroe. The Supreme Court of Indiana has deolded that no aol of the parent ean make the enlist ment of ft minor under eighteen years of age valid, such persons being no part ol the militia foroe of tbe country, Alrid Mors, late Clerk of the Fairfax coun ty (Va ) Court, now deceased, Is said by a cor respouaent of ihe PoiUdelphia Inquirer to be the person who stole Vsshington's original sill and sold it to the Britieh Museum. Some of tbe olergymen ol Boston, part of the New England " three thousand," have formed what tbey call an "Emancipation Commission," for Ihe purpose of becking up the emancipation proclamation of the President. Tbey have issued an address to Mr. Lincoln. U.S. Senator 3 G. Arnold, of Rhode Island, having been olassed by the radical journals as a Republican, bas written a' letter repudiating all sympathy with that parly, and stating (hat he was eleoted lo opposition 10 it. Certain New York memberi of Congress are said to Lave been detected in receiving feee for procuring eirn missions In the army, in one oase charging as high a four hundred dollars for their services in prccuiiug a skgtu commission of a low grade. Official statements show that there are over eixty thoujuod sick and wounded soldiers hospital at Washirglou, aside from tbe immense number of convalescents not yet able to return to tbeir regiments. In tbe convalescent camp. near Wasbirgton, there are from twelve to fif teen thoutacd soldiers only partially recovered from wounds or diseare. One man was frozen to death there on Saturday night. A large portion of these soldiers are from tbe West. The cootrubiLdj at Helens, Arkansas, It seems, aro having a bard time of it. A corres pondent of tbe Ibdianapolis Journal, Abolition, says tbey are in a wretched condition, crowded together in small tents like hogi, covered with filth and vermin, illy clothed and far worse led, and, lacking proper medical attendance, tbey die dally in large numbers. Tbey throng eime of the etmps, begging for meat and bread. and stealing everything that is not carefully watched. Some of them are quartered near our picket line, and the writer bas often seen them eagerly bunting and catching rats, and, after a slight dressing and cooking, eat them with avidity. Tbey lurk in the woods, die from exposure, and in some cases have been left nn- buried. Gen. W. T. Sherman, who Is the military commander at Memphis, recommends that, in stead of sbinplasters which the Common Counoil of that oity proposes to issue five, teo, twenty-fire, aud flity cant pickiges of raw cotton be done op aud pissed as currenoy the cotton to be of the standard value of half a dollar a pound. Ao ordinary roll of what Is termed cj'.ton batting weighs about half a pound, and an. armful of General Sherman's proposed currency would not purchsse a break fast for au ordinary lizsd family. We feel a little curious to know bow the cotton money succeeds, and to learn whether octton is king or currenoy. A letter from Washington says "It is now acknowledged, even by MoClellan's enemies, that perhaps he was right in his telegraphic complaints from Harper's Ferry, and they do not scruple to express sincere regret that tbe victor of Antietam should have been stopped in his onward movements against the enemy, month ago. . Tbete are other things which that fraternity will regret before tbey get through life." We find tbe following special dispatch from Cincinnati in the Chicago Timet of Monday, under date of December 7ib: Dr. Olds has not been released, and tbe opin ion now prevails that tbe Abolitionists want to keep him confined in Kirt Lafayette to gain one rote for U. S. Senator. The feeling between tbe friends of Chase and Wade is extremely bitter. Cbase is trying out Wade's throat for tbe (J. S. Senate. He anxious to get out of tbe Cabinet. Ooe yes r ago a Chase Republican editor in tbis city said that be regretted that be ever went into tbe Cabinet; that Lincoln was a course, vulgar mae; and that be dll nothing at tbe Cabinet Councl but tell coarse jests and vulgar stories to such an extent aa almost to incapacitate the Cabinet from boeloee. Cbase Is favorable to letting tbe South go, and came to this oity after be be came Secretary of tbe Treasury, and induotd hi organ here, tbe Commercial, to break grontd in favor of that policy. Chase thinks be esn be elected President of tbe North, but not of tbe whole country united. It i regarded here as ominous, and furnish ing proof of tbe truth of tbe charge, that Governor Morton' organ, ihe Indianapolis Journal, has not denied the truth of tbe charge Imputed to thent of a revolutionary design to thwart the will of the people In tbe manner I bare already telegraphed you. Thousands of Democrats throughout the State threaten to attend tbe opening session of t!ie Legislature, and, if Ihe Abolitionists persist in revolution, serious consequences may ensue. General Baell's official report of tbe Perry vllle battle I under stood to be a complete refutation of tbe charges against him, and, In ooneeqoenoe, it is not permit.ed to see tbe light publication by tbe Abolition Cabinet at Washington. Itt suppression is uroel iojustloe ft brave and gallant offioer. Unlike Gen eral Pope. Buell will not rush It Into print, and disobedienoe to orders. Some of his revilers squirm wben it does appear. Tom Ford Is traveling through Ohio, breath rengeance on tbe Harper's Ferry military investigation, and say the court was composed knaves and soonndre's. As an Abolitionist, Ford bas ft right to do as be cbooiee. . I am advised or terriDie disclosures,- to do nubllsbed. relative to inhuman treatment of nersons at Camo Chase.

Thornton, of Company D, 100th regiment O. V. I., and whilst we most humbly submit to tbe will of our Heavenly Father in tbis, to us, sad visita tion, yet we can not but mourn the early loss of one who, in all the relation which he sus tained to tbis regiment as a man and officer, bas endeared himself to the entire regiment, and baa shown that bad be lived to meet the foe in deadly strife, neither bis regiment, his country, nor his friend would have bad cause to blush for Captain Thornton. And whereas, It 1 due to bl memory, aa a small token of respect to his many virtues, that we thus formally express our appreciation of his worth and onr loss, though our loss is bis everlasting gain; therefore, be it Ketohed, That in the death of Captain Thornton, of Company D, lliO.b regiment 'J.

May He, who alone can suit tin aud comlort her, give to ber "that coneoiation which the world can neither give nor take away."
