HE BOLDEST Of THE R A Manifesto Aimed at of the Visible The Authorities Accept the Challenge by Instituting a Policy of Repression Which Will More Quickly Bring Things to a Focus. St. Petersburg. Dec. 15. (Via Eyd tkuhnen. Dec. 10.. Labor organiza tions throush the "Invisible Govern ment," threw a bombshell into the gov ernment camp by Issuing a manifesto, following the form of regular imperial documents, declaring the bankruptcy of the treasury. It orders the non payment of taxes everywhere and in sists upon the payment of wages in gold or silver and counsels the with drawal of all deposits in savings banks in sold. The manifesto is a terrible indict ment of the manner in which the bureaucracy brought the country to financial ruin. It asserts that the gov ernment squandered not only the gov ernment's income but the proceeds of foreign loans and railroad earnings, leaving no money with which to feed the soldiers and sailors or provide the country with roads or schools. The government is also charged with using the treasury funds to speculate on the bourse. The manifesto is con sidered a great step forward for the revolutionists and clearly throws down the gage of battle to the government which was caught off guard and didn't even attempt to suppress the newspa pers publishing it. The document was signed by mem bers of the workmens' council, social democrats, social revolutionists and Polish socialists. Wholesale arrests are expected as a result of its publi cation. The manifesto created a tremendous sensation on its publication and the government accepted - the challenge contained in it and confiscated the edi tions of all newspapers and printing, including the Russ, the Syn Onteches tva, the Nevaia, the Sehizn, the Ka sha Shisn, the Nashhalo and Svo Bod antreg, but only after the newspapers Keep cheerful and bright, everything will come out all right, if you eat DON OFRIO'S CRYSTALLIZED CACTUS CANDY.

TAGES S NAR1ES the Financial Integrity Government had boon circulated everywhere. The government announced that it would proceed legally against the editors of these papers for violating the press law find it has alro begun the arrest of members of the committees of or ganizations that signed the manlfc-slo. It is the impression that this action 0:1 the pait of the gjvernincnt will precipitate event?. St. Petersburg, Dec. 15. Strange to Fay the manifesto of the proletariat or ganizations, while it increased the ner vousness oi: the bourse, did not cause a smash so far a3 the imperial fours are concerned. The price of industrial shares, how ever, continued to fall, owing to the scared attitude of the banks, which are refusing accommodations to firms. It is impossible to borrow on the best business paper at less than 10 or 11 per cent. In view of the evident determination of the government to arrest the agita tors throughout the country, the min ister of justice has issued circulars to courts and procurators in the prov inces pointing to the necessity of prompt preliminary investigations and trials not to inflame public passion by the retention in prison of persons against whom cases are not clear. A private letter received frcm Harbin dated November 5, denies the reports of widspread rioting, mutiny and burning at Harbin on November 1G, 18 and 19 which were given in dispatches from Tokio and other places. The let ter says there was much discontent in the army on account of a universal desire to return to Russia and because of the appearance of a mutinous Spirit and grumbling. There were many ar rests made and Jewish newspapers suppressed for spreading th3 propa ganda, but the lstter does not mention disorders on a large scale. Reports of mutinies in -regiments. in various parts of Russia, however, continue to pour In ceasles?'y.

AN OVERTURE TO MUTINEERS. St. Petersburg, Dec. 15. (Via Eyd tkuhnen, Dec. 16.) A colonel of the grenadiers today sent a message to the mutineers here offering to consider their proper grievances if they would submit them. He has received no re ply. Only eight operators are work ing in the telegraph offices. The tel egraphers congress has again resolved to continue the strike . The Slpvo severely criticizes the for eign office for the appointment of M. Bakhametieff, formerly minister at The Hague and diplomatic agent in Bul garia, as minister to Japan, saying the selection of r. man from n third rate post Is a puerile attempt to humiliate Japan, which w'U react upon Russia in the eyes of the world. MERELY WANTED TO KNOW. St. Petersburg, Dec. 15. (Via Eyd tkuhnen, Dec. 16.) Tonight the tele graph office at Kieff called up St. Pet ersburg and asked whether Minister of the Interior Durnovo had been dis missed. Receiving a negative reply the sounder ceased and all efforts to call up that city were in vain. The same thing happened on the Irkutsk wire. NEEDED AT RIGA. Se. Petersburg. Dec. 15.

The Russian pro fessors of Warsaw university have or ganized a volunteers postal service. Thousands of bags of mail are await ing distribution. The janitors have struck and the houses are unprotected save for the tenants, who are acting as their own patrols. Sporadic mnrders continue. INVITATION TO A MASSACRE. Moscow, Dec. 16 (via Berlin). A proclamation is being distributed in viting the people to the square of the Kremlin cn December 19, to a public service. It is believed by some that this means a massacre by the "black hundred" after the people assemble. Today's advices from Riga are meagre. Confirmation has been received, how ever, that the governor has asked for warships. Reports are in circulation that there have been collisions in the Ftreets of the city. A letter written December 11 and brought through by special engine, which was riddled with bullets, says every dead wall i:i Riga bears posters urging the mob to attack the gentry and capitalists. Women of the better classes have b?en sent elsewhere and the gentlemen remain ing have formed themselves into mili tia and are holding the houses of the nobility, while the soldiers hold the public places. The writer says they have resolved to defend themselves to the last In the event the peasantry se cure their entrance and are joined by the proletariat of the city. OCEAN MAIL CONTRACTS WtiGHT SYSTEM BETTER The Government Lost Nearly a Half Million Last Tear. Washington, Dec. 16. According to the annual report of superintendent of mails,"' it cost the goverriment during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1S03, $421,630 more for ocean mail service under the contract system than it would had the mails been transported and paid for by weight. The most disproportionate cases, the report shows, -are the routes between San Francisco and Tahiti and New York and Havana. In the former instance the cost was $42,120 for carrying mails which if paid for by weight would have been but $1,133, while it cost to trans port mails to Havana $71,878 but which if paid for by weight would have re sulted in an outlay of but $2,239. In but one instance it is shown that the contract system worked advanta geously to the government and that was on the New York and South hampton route, which cost $663,583, whereas it is stated had it been paid for under the system of weights, it would have involved an expenditure of $119,748 additional.

EMERGENCY BILL PASSED It Took Another Days Sen ate Talking ThVIIouse Prcceeds to L00K Into the Shady Recesses of the Naval Academy. Washington. Dec. 16. The senate to day passed the Panama canal emer gency appropriation bill but the result was not attained until after the de bate on the bill had been continued the . greater part of the day to the exclu- i sion of practically all other business. I Set speeches were made by Senator Bacon in advocacy of his amendment . requiring estimates for the canal com , mission salaries; by Senator Allison, J who devoted himself largely to the de tails of the bill; by Senator Culberson, who criticized the employment of Bishop as "press agent"; by Senator Stone, who criticized the purchase of American ships to carry Panama sup plies in face of the announced deter mination to go abroad for vessels un der conditions then existing, and by Senator Xewlands, who expressed the opinion that the construction of the canal should have been intrusted to j the geological survey. A substitute for Senator Bacon's amendment offered by Senator Hale was accepted. It specifically requires that congress shall be supplied with regular estimates of ail salaries except those paid laborers skilled and un skilled. Otherwise the bill was passed as reported from the committee. During the session Mr. Hale made an authorized announcement that Bishop's duty as "press agent" would be discon tinued. SENATE COMMITTEES. Washington, Dec. 16. Assignments to fill senate committee vacancies will be announced .Tuesday. The com mittee having charge of the work has concluded its work and will report to the republican caucus Wednesday. It has been well known and widely1 published who will receive the most important places. One appointment in doubt was in the judi ciary committee. There are four re publican vacancies, but the places were conceded to Senators Foraker, Dillingham and Knox. The other place has been, sought by Senators Kitt redge and Hopkins. The committee assigned the appointment of Kittredge. who claimed by reason of eeniorily and the fact that he has few important places. Senator Hopkins was assigned to a place on the post-office and post roads committee in place of Senator Beveridge, who was given a position on the foreign relations committee. There are a large number of vacancies on other committees to be filled by republicins. One vacancy that occurs on the finance committee will be given to Senator Hale. THE HOUSE. Washington, Dec. 16. The house in dulged itself again today to the extent of four hours of what was many times termed the academic discussion of the federal control of insurance. It was the fourth day of the debate and the interest of the members had appreci ably diminished. The democratic con tention for state's rights appeared in j the oratory. Republicans who spoke confined themselves more to the com Imittee reference to which should be j made of the subject of insurance in the president's message. Many views were j expressed. None of them, however, . supported the pending proposition to send the subject to the ways and means committee. The holiday recess was fixed from next Thursday to January 4. j For the purpose of bringing out in I formation showing existence of a civil pension list, the house asked the pres ident for the number of civil employes of the government who had reached the age cf 70 years. Mr. Sullivan of Massachusetts, paid his respects to President Roosevelt by stating that he did not believe him 

KEPUBLICA.N I infallible either in his law, his s:c.to I iolicy or In his recollection of conver sations with distinguished visitors. Urging against federal control of in ruiance Mr. Sullivan maintained that there was ample state authority to reg- j ulate legal abuses, and he continued. "Neither the state nor national legisla- I ture can legislate honesty into a board of directors of high finance sit ting in New Yoik, any more than they can legislate thirst out of the citizens of Iowa, Kansas or Maine." A resolution was agreed to requiring the president to transmit to the house the number of government clerks In the various departments who have reach ed the age of seventy years. In ex plaining the purpose of the resolution, Mr. Tawney said information was de sired by the appropriations committee in making up the executive, legislative and judicial appropriation bill. He made the comment that under civil service there seemed to be ample op portunity to get into the government service but no way to get out. 

ANNAPOLIS AUTHORITIES. Aimed at By a House Resolution Of. fered Yesterday. Washington, Dec. 16. The officers of the naval academy are ( harshly criti cized for winking at hazing in a reso lution introduced today by Reprcsenta tive Peary of Maryland. ' Charges were made against the au thorities of the academy as follows: "It appears to be fairly ascertained from testimony given before the court martial that the practice of fagging, hazing and fighting is common at said institution and that the same is winked at and connived at by the officers of said institution, whose duty it is to maintain discipline among the mid shipmen and train and perfect them for service as officers of ihe navy and to protect such midshipmen in their health and life and . that failure to maintain discipline lies more with of ficers of said institution than upon the midshipmen attendng there." After reviewing the Branch-Meriwether case and the recent hazing of Midshipman Jerdon Pettus Kimbrough, the resolution provides for a complete investigation by the committee of the house naval aqffairs and recommenda tions by that committee si.owing that the constitution may be reconstructed and changed so as to prevent such "dis astrous and disgraceful occurrences." In conclusion the resolution urges that the responsibility for the recent events at Annapolis be fixed definitely and that the committee make recom mendations which may lay the blame where it belongs, "so that hereafter the result may not end with the mere dismissal of promising young men from the institution but shall bring to bar the officers in charge of the institu tions. RUMOR OF REBELLION. Annapolis, Md., Dec. 16. There is a rumor afloat among midshipmen that when congressional investigation of hazing commences all the upper class men will join in an acknowledgment that they have taken part in hazing and thus in a sense defy the investi gators. CONTRACT SURGEONS MERE MAKESHIFT General Wood Favors an Increase of Efficiency of Medical Corps. Washington, Dec. 16. -Secretary Tai: today fcent to the, senate' a letter from Major General Leonard Wood, . com mending the proposed legislation to in crease the efficiency of the medical corps of the army. General Wood op posed employment of contract sur- fgeons, declaring the system "a make shift and an expensive one, as is our policy of the expansion of the medical j department in time of war through the employment of inexper:encel med ical men. These gentlemen, whatever their professional attainments, know little of army methods or handling large bodies of men, and we have, al ways paid for their education in time of war by enormous expediture of men ,and money, with it3 resulting in em : barrassment in the way of inefficient troops and a large pension list." - 11 PAGES SACRED AND TUCSO The Much Vaunted Joint Statehood Meeting Covered by a Wet Blanket Only Two Towns in the Territory Were Represented Each by a Single Delegate Albuquerque Furnish; d the Fire for the Entertainment. Tucson, Ariz., Dec 16. (Special.) The territorial joint statehood conven- 1 tion here this evening was a distinct ' disappointment to its promoters, for it failed utterly In being a territorial assemblage. The audience, number ing 350, was made up entirely of Tuc son ieople and of thH number half were women. Of the men ho were present at least one-third were promi- nent Tucson business men, who are openly opposed to jointure with New Mexico, but who attended to show that Tucson is willing to be fair in the statehood matter and willing to give the jointure supporters a fair hearing. The expected delegations from Phoenix, Douglas, Bisbee and Nogales failed to materialize, as did also the list of celebrated speakers from the various parts of the territory. In fact Albuquerque, New Mexico, had a big ger representation than all Arizona outside of Tucson. Albuquerque sent a delegation of four politicians and . ex -office holders: Ex-Delegate B. S. Rodey, J. J. Sheridan, W. B. Childers and E. A. Miera. Col. Allen T. Bird of Nogales and Judge Charles F. Ainsworth of Phoenix were the only outsiders present. Ed itor Bird was unable to explain the ab sence of the "enthusiastic" Santa Cruz delegation. "Four persons expected to come, but for one reason or another, they could not get away," was his lame excuse for coming alone. -' Rodey was the chief speaker of the evening. His remarks were received very coolly. Rodey devoted most of his speech to his record as a delegate to congress from New Mexico. He stated that it was now or never if Arizona wished statehood and that President Roosevelt would veto any bill giving separate statehood to either Arizona or New Mexico. He declared that there was nothing incompatible between citi zens of the two territories. He charac terized Arizona's objection, to jointure as "cry-baby tactics." He referred to toe university, briefly stating that it would remain in Tucson but asserting that the possibility of ifs: removal should be forgotten in the great bene fits which would result to both terri tories from jointure. Judge Chas. F. Ainsworth, of Phoe nix, made the. longest speech of the evening. More than one fourth of the audience left the theater while he was speaking. He declared that the oppo rition to joint statehood in Phoenix gas based solely on the probability that
