An article appeared in yesterday' Union, containing several forms of Bonds fur Good Conduct, ()th of Allegiance, Guarantee of Trotcction, 4c.,' follovty; by some remarks from General J'.Oh't- CHANS. T;io article was preceded by few brief paragraphs, which should have -appeared as a communication, but, throug n oversight of the compositor, they ap pearcd as editorial We correct thic, be cause ono of these jircfatory remarks was directly contrary to what we have stated before, namely: "The form of Bond and Protection, heretofore publish cd, is intended for loyal citizens only. We have positively stated the contrary on a previ ins occasion, and if we under stand the inclining of plain language Governor Johnson and General Bosk cbanh, tnke the panic view of the matte that we do, and certainly they ppeak by authority, inasmuch as the Bonds, etc are issued by their authority. Loyal citizens are not required, nor desired, to give Bond, or t.iko tho oath of allegiance The Government asks no oath or bond of .such, unless no other evidence of their loyalty exists. We sincerely hope that all who have departed from the path of loyalty, w ill take the oath and observe it, faithfully. A bleeding .State asks it of her misguided citizens. Nov is tha Accepted Time.

The men who se riously controvert the opinions of Wash INUTON, of i!f.1'TK!!SON, of Chief Justice Marshall, and of Hknky Clay, are in significant in iiiiiiUnth, and in character Tho diflVulty in removing this system which looms up among us, like a dark and flame-crowned volcano, i;i the midst of a flow ery idand, originates in that universal timidity which men feel in assailing an inveterate and ancientcvil. Loudly as we oulogizp martyrs there are but lew of us who aro willing to rUkthc perils of niartydoiii. Wo "sco the right and approve it," but dread to reach it by traveling thorny paths, and climbing pre cipitous steeps. Wo indulge the hope, that by some unknown process, "tho evil will remedy itself," and natural indo lence, combining with timidity, per suades us to let it alone. Slavery is a great evil it is a great misfortune that ever a slave was In ought here it would bo an excellent thing if every slavo was removed from the country, hut vow is an unpropitioti.4 time to agitnte the pro priety and mode of its extinction, strange (hut at the. very time, when the sys inn of shirry i roching, an.

'J'.c righl of free, un trammelled discussion must be protected on every topic 1 iscussion must be as free as IhougU itself. If the nation were perfectly pacific, (hire would be much greater plausibility in )!, plea that wo ought not to excite or agitate the public mind ; but r.s the people are already ex cited, and excited by the unprovoked act of 111" flav interest itself, we cannot but think that this is a peculiarly lining time fr ttimigning sl.vvi ry at the bar of common sense, juMice, and patriotism, and trying it to bee whether it will die or live. If innocent, let it lite,- bnt if guilty, let it die.

Such men will never discuss the re moval of slavery. These will never discuss the removal of anything. They have but one idea, and that is compromiie. They be lung to that class of men who when pal- riots pitched the tea into Boston Harbor, aid that it was an unjustifiable trespass upon private property; ant who 'insisted that General Warren should withdraw his Continentals from Bunker Hill, and send a peace Comtuis sioner to tho British General. Bnt we desire to see slavery discussed some day, says these self-styled conservatives When ? When there are 8,000,000, in stead of 4,000,000 f slaves to remove, and the obstacles in the way of their removal are twice as great; and twice as numerous as they are now.

Halleck replied that there could not possibly bo more than 20,000 sent. General McClellan asked time to con sider the matter till morning, when ho agreed to go on with that number. On Halleck's arrival home ho received a dis patch that at least "5,000 would bo re quired. The report slates that such re infurccments could not bo sent without leaving Washington and Baltimore al most defenceless ; and an order for the withdrawal of the army of the Potomac was issued on the 3d ot August. A previous order having been given for the removal of the sick, and transports in vast numbers supplied. But a protest was received from General McClellan on the 5th, and that tho order was not put in lorce Tor eleven days. On the 1st or ders were issued to General Burnsidc to embark at Newport News lor Aquia Creek, who arrived promptly on the 3d. A review of tho movements before Washington is made. He says a part of the Army of the 1 otomac was ordered forward from Alexandria, and that Gen. Cox was ordered by rail via Washington from Western Virginia wi'h the main portions of his force. Of General Pope's order on the 27th to General Porter to be at Bristow Station the next morning, he says : For some unexplained reason Por ter did aot reply, and his corps was not in the battks of the 28th and 29th, in which General Pope gained some ground, although the battles were not decisive. Of the reinforcements from Alexandria, embracing at length the whole Peninsular army, it is laid that some of the corps moved with becoming activity, but the delays of others were neither creditable nor excusable. The soldiers actually eniratred in these battles fought with treat bravcrv. but many thousands straggled away from lueir commands, and it is said not af.'w voluntarily surrendered to the enemy so as to be paroled. It is added that had the Army of Iho Potomac arrived a few days earlier the rebels could have been easily defeated and perhaps destroyed. The losses at South Mountain and Antie tam are put at 1,742 killed. 8.0150 wound ed, and !I13 missing; a total of 10,721. The rep rt states that the armv rested on the north bank of the Potomac, near Sharpsburg, from the 17th of Septemb.r to the 2d of October, and sava that thn long inactivity of so large an army in tue lace ol a defeated foe, during the most favorable season for ranid marches and vigorous campaigns, was a matter of great disappointment and regret. uen. iiaiieclv says no telegraphed Gen.
