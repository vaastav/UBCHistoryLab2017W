ONA REPUBLICAN. ii JLU.JLVS CONGRESS OPENS The Proceedings Were Tame and Formal PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Document Ably Covering Every Phase of the Hew Business Which Has Been Presented There is 8o Much to Be Done That Time Can not Be Unnecessarily Spent in Honoring Dead. Washington, Dec. 3. The opening session of the house waj brilliant, but not exciting. There were th usual throngs in the galleries and the usual display of floral pieces on the Hour, but the proceedings were purely for mal, consisting of rapping to order by the speaker, the prayer by the chaplain, the roll call of numbers, the appointment of formal conKr.it tees to. wait upon the president, and the recep tion of and reading of the president's message. Despite the fact that a great presi dential campaign had been concluded within a month, the best of feeling seemed to prevail between the victors and vanquished. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The Djcumsnt Exhaustively Outlines the Administrathji Policy. The message was an exhaustive doc ument, covering in detail all subjects which have be:i presented to the country since the adjournment of the long session. The message is in- part: "To the senate and house of repre sentatives: With the outgoing of the old' and the Incoming of the new cen tury you begin the last session of the fifty-'sixth congress with evidences on every ham) of individual and national prosperity and with proof of th.2 grow ing strength land increasing power for the good of republican ins.itutions. In our foreign; interoaursi t': r-mJr.ant qutstt-Ti has been the .treatment of the Chinese problem. Apart from this cur relations with the powers have been happy. The recent troubles in China have itbeir origin dep in the charac ter of the Chinese races, to wfaom the innovations of modern civilization be come types of an alien Invasion, t hang ing the course of their national law and fraught with vague forebodings of disaster to their beliefs and to aheir self conitrol." . . OUR 

POLICY IX CHINA.' After recking the course of the out break and the heroic defense of the legations, the policy of the United States toward China Is outlined in these words: "The policy t,f the gov ernment of the United States is to seek b solution which may bring about per manent safety and peace; preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity; protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and Inter national law and to safeguard for the world the principle of equal and im partial trade. "We forego no Jot of our undoubted right to exact exemplary and deterrent punishment of the authors and abet tors of the criminal acts whereby we and other nations have suffered griev ous Injury;" THE MATTER OF INDEMNITY. In regard to the indemnity the pres ident thinks that measured in money alone it may be beyond the- ability of China to meet, but that compensation can be in part made by increased guarantees and immunities to for eigners and by the opening of China to the . commerce of the world. In the treatment of the Chinese problems the message continues: "Japan has acted harmoniously and generously In con cert with other powers and the closing year has demonstrated the competence of the Japanese to hold a foremost place' among modern peoples." Reference is made to the ratification of the Hague peace convention by the United States, Austria, England, Ger many, France, Russia Spain, Italy, Japan, Sweden, Norway, the Nether lands, Portugal, Persiail Roumania and Siam, and the president cites his ap pointment of Benjamin Harrison, Melville W. Fuller, John. W. Griggs and Judge George Gray as members of tli? tribunal for the United States.' THE 

ISTHMIAN CANAL. In regard to the Nicaraguan canal the president calls attention to the convention with England to facilitate the construction of tihe canal and urg.s tarry action ito remove any dif ficulty that might arise from the Clay-ton-Bulwer treaty. In regard to 'the Philippines atten tion is called to the fact that when the treaty with Spain was drawn up the boundary as ilelineated omitted several islands west of the Sulus. In order to cure this defect a supplementary treaty has been negotiated whereby Spain re lquishes the title for $100,000. T-iiis trvaty will early be laid before the senate. A 

YEAR'S BUSINESS. "It Is gratifying to note," continues the imessage, "that the surplus reve nues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, were $79,527,060.18. For the six years previous we hod only deficits aggregating $283,022,991.14. The re ceipts from customs were $233,164, S71. 1G, an Increase over the proceeding year of $27,030,439.41. The war de partment expenses for the year were $134,774,767.7S, a reduction of $95,066, 486.G9 from the previous year. In the navy department the expenditures were $55,953,077.72, a decrease of $7,989, 026.53. "Our foreign trade shows a remark able record1 of commercial and indus trial progress, the total import and export for the fiscal year for the first time in the history of our country ex ceeding tw.ot billion dollars." It is recommended 'that the internal revenue taxes be reduced thirty mil lion dollars by fhe remission of those taxes which experience has shown to be niost burdensome. ' A RIGGER NAVY. An increase in the navy is endorsed and authority is asked, to increase the army to 100,000, including 15.C00 native troops in the Philippines. As to trusts, a legislation is urged "founded on a wise and just discrimination be tween what is injurious and what Is useful and necessary In business oper ations." As to the Phiillippin.es the president further says, pending the ex pression of the will of congress, he has used the authority vested in him by the constitution ond by the statutes to uphold the flag In flhese distant is lands. Progress toward pacification has' been favorable and. the only oppo sition is in the nature of a guerrilla warfare, which "while ineffective to alter the general control now estab lished1. Is still sufficient to beget in security and thus delay the confer ment upon the Filipinos of the full measure of self government which we standi ready to give t'hem." THE 

PHILLIPPINES. Referring to his instructions to the Phillippine commission, the president stays: "In all forms of government and administrative provisions which they, are authorized to prescribe, the fact to be borne In mind Is that the government which they are establish ing is designed not for our satisfac tion, but for the happiness, peace and prosperity of the Philllppine islands, and the measures adopted should be made to conform Ito their customs, their habits and even their prejudices to the fullest extent consistent with a Just and effective government." A cable is reeommendMl cionnec'-ins the United States and the Philippin. s by way of Hawaii. The .message says a satisfactory settlement or tne armor plate question, whereby our govern ment secures armor plate at a reason able price, has avoided the necessity for erecting a government plant. A 

DANGER OF PROSPERITY. In conclusion fhe message says: "In our great prosperity we must guard against the clanger it invites of extravagance In government expendi- 1 :r3 and ap;onri?.tions. in tr.- ' great era ti business activity and oi nortunlty caution is n.-.t untlm-ly. Our growing po.ver brings with H temptations and p.-rils. It must not be used to Invite conflicts nor f.w op pression, but for the mre effective maintenance of those principles of equality and justice upon which our institutions and happiness depend. Let us bear 1n miml that the founda tion of our government Is liberty, its superstructure peace. "Wm. McKinley." The reading of the message, which naturally was the feature cf the day. otLupied over two hours. It was lis tened to with respectful interest by both sides. The deaths of the late Representative Hoffecker. of Delaware, and Senators Davis, of Minnesota, and Gear, of Iowa, were announced, and as a fur ther mark of respect, the house ad journed until tomorrow. THE SENATE SESSION Eecognition of the Fact That Time Is Precious. Washington, Dec. 3. In the senate today, the work of the short session of the lifty-sixth congress was success fully launched'. It hud been the pur pose of the senate to announce the death of Senators Gear (Iowa) and Davis (Minnesota), immediately after assembling, and then to adjourn, and to receive the message cf the presi dent tomorrow, but as this had been announced1 by the leaders of both branches of congress to be a "business session," it was determined to receive the message today, and thus gain one day in a session, in which that much time may be of immense importance. Aside from the reading of the mes sage and the administration of the oath of ofUVe to Wiliiam B. Dilling ham, the new senator from' Vermont, who succeeds the late Justin S. Morrill, no business was transacted. The other new member of the body, for mer representative Jonathan 1. Doili ver, who succeeds the late Senator Gear of Iowa, was present through out the session, but his credentials were not presented and he was not sworn in. These formalities will be complied with tomorrow, now that the senate has been informed of the death of Sena'. or Gear. THE TAX 

REDUCING RILL. Washington, Dec. 3. Chairman Payne, of the ways and' means commit tee, said today tha't no exact pro gramme had been fixed as to the time of acting in the coirmittee on the bill for reducing the war revenues, or fur considering the measure in the house. THE MINORITY IN CAUCUS. Washington, Dec. 3. A caucus of the democratic members of the house of representatives was held in the hall of the house at the close of the session today to consider'the course to be tak en on army legislation. Representa tive Hay, of Virginia, member of the military committee, explained the s a tus of the bill proposed by Secretary Root, and urged the desirability of not legislating until the course of the gov ernment as to the Philippines has been more definitely determined. The cau cus adjourned without action. PORTO RICAN TARIFF Its Abrogation Under Discus sion on the Island A Consideration of Local Meant to Meet the Expenses of the Gov ernment How it May Be Done. Washington, Dec. 3. The abrogation of the Porto Rican tariff is being se riously discussed by the press of Porto Rico. The Porto Rican tariff act. It will be remembered, provides that "whenever the legislative assembly of Porto Rico shall have enacted and put Into operation a system cf local taxa tion to meet the necessities of the gov ernment of Porto Rico, by this act es tablished, and shall, by resolution duly passed, so notify the president, he shall make proclamation thereof, and there upon all tariff duties on merchandise and articles going Into Porto Rico from the United States, or coming into the United States from Porto Rico, fhall cease, and from and after such dale all such merchandise and articles shall be entered at 'the several ports of entry free of duty." The Porto Ric-n legislature, elected on Nevemier 6th, the date of the gen eral election in the United States, is to meet shortly, and will, under the pro visions of the Porto Rican act above eiuoted, have the power to immedlate'.y terminate the Porto Rican tariff by enacting legislation which will pro vide funds for the necessities of the government of Porto Rico, and the question whether this action shall be taken and the 13 per cent tariff thus term'inated', is being discussed by the press and publio of that island, as is Hiss Democracy: Marraige (to shown by the following leading editor ial taken from the San Juan (Porto Rico) Daily News, of November 13, 1900, just received by the treasury bu reau of statistics: "We have lived now under the 85 per cent preferential tariff. The question now is, Is it good or bad? Has it helped or injured us? The legislature will , have these questions to decide. We now have the eiuestion to deal with, aside and apart tro.iv politics. Its use as a campaign club is past and gone. The burden of deciding this very important question is solely upen the legislature. As it decrees, so shall tt be. If it desires to abolish the tar iff and operate the island upon a free trade basis, it can be so ordered. If j the people of Porto Rico, through the iff, it can be done. A precedent has been established whkh will permit this clars of taxation. It has been legally decreed that such action is constitu tional. If the tariff is abolished, it is at once that a more burdensome and higher rate of internal taxation must be imposed. Where, and upon what, shall this be levied, is, indeed, a per plexing question. "Aside from all the difficulties that may or will arise from the abolition of the tariff., let us glance at the tariff itself, and see what it has done. In the last six months the 15 per cent tariff has afforded the island as much, if not more, than the 100 per cent tariff. The theory 'that the way to increase revenues is by lowering taxes," is pro ven to be true for Porto Rico. This ' m-armr. will Kii .nnrnnt!v infrpssin as our trade increases, as it is sure to do. It has helped the consumer, for it has towered the taxes he has to pay, not only. upon A.xerican gooJs, but up on all goods that enter our market in competition with them. This result? in an int-rease of Importations. This helps the proelucer by constantly pro viding him a means to carry his goods to the great American market, which is always so hungry for the products this island has to dispose of. Again, unless we have a traffic both ways, the steamer must make one trip without a cargo and the freight is thereby dou bled. "A tariff helps us as borrowers; it will give our set uritAVs a stand in the United! States, which they could not have without permanent revenue like the tariff revenue. The argument so often advanced in favor of a tariff tax as against other means of raising rev enue, that it Is easily collected, is es pecially forcible in Porto Rico. We would advise that the tariff i?j neces sary, and if it were not, it wld still (114" ' f"' if I I II 'I r. IH! 1 Zl ,r -:, he the ir.'osx convenient and logical means of raising our revenue. Let the tariff stand at 15 per cent." 

BURGLAR HIRED TO OPEN SAFE. Woman Allowed to Employ Convict to Obta'in Valuable Papers. Columbus, O., Dec. 3. In order to ob tain valuable papers belonging to the late Col. F. J. Pickard, a civil -nsineer, who died a few days ago, Mrs. Pickarl was permittel to employ an expert ! safeblower, now a convict in the stal? penitentiary here. The burglar was ionveyed' last night in a closed carriage 'to the safe, which he blew open in twelve in.inutos, and was then takeii back to his cell before daylight this morning. Col. Piekard alone knew the com bination of the safe and the town was searched in vain for an expert to open it before the novel plan of obtaining the services of a burglar was adopted. NATIONAL W. C. T. TJ. Opening of the Twenty-Seventh An nual Convention. Washington, Dec 3. In the hand some auditorium of the Lafayette op ra house, which was prettily decor ated with flags and Mowers, the twenty-seventh annual meeting of the Na tional Woman's (Christian (Temper ance union was called to order short ly after 9 o'clock this morning by Mrs. L. M. N. Stevens, of Maine, president of the organization. Hundreds cf del egates, some of whomi had journeyed thousands of miles t- participate in the proceedings, occurred' .the seats and bencher, cn the floor of the auditorium, while the balconies were filled' with in terested spectators. The convention began- with the singing of Vhe hymn, "Give to the Winds Thy Fears," frcm the white ribbon hymnal, after which Mrs. Cornelia B. Forbes, president of the Connecticut W. C. T. U., led in prayer. The roll call of official mem- Populism) is a failure. i hers, by Mrs. Clara C. Hoffman, of Missouri, followed, and then came the appointment of committees ca creden tials, publications, courtesies and tel- : egrams. In her annual address. President Lil ' lian M. N. Stevens presented soma in teresting facts. As to the progress of i the reform, she spoke in the most eon : fident lanuage. "During the last twenty years, total abstinence and the ! prohibition sentiment have greatly ad ; vaneed." she said. "In 1SS4, the peo pie cf Maine, by a vote of three to one, placed the heretofore statutory pro ; hibitory law In the constitution cf tho ' state. Kansas and North Dakota have also adopted constitutional pro hibition. Neal Dow never claimed more beneficent. results for the law in the state of Maine than do Judge Pol : lock, of North Dakota, and Charles 1 Sheldon, of Kansas, claim for their re spective states. Last winter, in Geor gia, a prohibitory law passed the house, by a large majority, and would have ; passed the senate but lor the concerted action against it by the Liquor Dealers' j association. Not until good people ! learn that they should be as active to promote good work as the evil-doers are to carry their points, shall we have correct epressions cf public opinion : concerning the great evils in our midst. "Within two years the sale or use of liquor has been prohibited on board the ships of the United Stales navy, or within the limits of the naval stations, i and as lately as February, 1899. con , gress passed a law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors in army camps, posts, exchanges . or canteens, or on any premises used for military purposes by tne United States. To b sure, this law has been declared null and void, but the end is not yet. With in a year a po'.ygamist has been reject ed as a member of the United States congress, and the White Ribbonerg re joice that they had a hand in bring- I lng about this righteous action. The I same public conscience that prevented Brigham Roberts having a seat in the , United States congress will yet can e to j be enacted the anti-canteen bill, now pending, or seme Kincirea measure. If the action be not so prompt as it was concerning that other great home question just referred to. we should not be discouraged, for it is only, about fifty years since the question of pro hibiting the sale of liquor has been be fore the people; consequently they are not so well educated upon it as upon the question of polygamy. Rut intem perance and impurity are twin evils, and both, alike, invade and destroy the sanctity of the home." THE
