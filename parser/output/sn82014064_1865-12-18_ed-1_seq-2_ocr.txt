We hear much sold in ccitShi quarters about the necessity of reconciliation, a* a ground for admitting the members elect from the eleven States lately in rebellion, Immediately to thclr«eats in Congress.' We desire to dis cuss every Issue calmly, temperately and ac cording to the actual facts of the case. To argue a necessity, far reconciliation implies present hostility, and where no hostility ex ists there con be no. reconciliation, for there is nothing -to reconcile. Now, there exists among the people of the North, of whatever party, no hostility to those of the South, "ffc provoked no war and began no war, hut being compelled to defend tbe ■ Union against the slaveholders, we fought till slavery and rebellion were destroyed, since which hour not a single act of ven geance, or even of Just punish ment, . has befallen a traitor or a rebel. Such a proof of the forbearance and magnanimity of a great people has no parallel in history. It Is evident, therefore, that wc arc, and were, at the surrender of Richmond, sufficiently, reconciled- But how with the South I The South has eight millions of whites and four millions of blacks who have been for generations in a state of constant war with each other, for Montesquieu, the chief of Trench writers on law, truly defines slavery as a stale of perpetual war, wherein the slave is always a prisoner and the master Is always on guard. The slaves ore loyal. The mas-. lore in the aggregate occupy at present the same position toward us as the slaves lately did toward them. They arc our prisoners of war, and we are on guard over them. Their loyalty to .ns is on & par with the late loyalty. of. the t-lavcs toward . there—it is compulsory not voluntary. The slave fonght and was whipped, and .so made loyal-to his master. The whites fought and were whipped, and hence they arc loyal to us—loyal to the lash, the bullet and the sword—loysl to Vicksburg, Spotti-ylvanla and Richmond—loyal to two millions of bayonets. Our foot is on the neck of the South. Tbe foot of the Sooth.ls on the neck of tbo negro.. IVc represent twenty millions. The South eight millions. The negro four millions. Such is America, as it Elands grouped to-day. Now, to the malt) question. Do the Copper heads and rebels want reconciliation and peace? Is it reconciliation or peace for as to abandon the South, and lut the old war of the eight millions against the four fight Its own way back toward slavery*' There can \>c no reconciliation till all parties are reconciled. It were perfidy to our allies to make a treaty of peace without protecting them. But dolboac Copperheads and rebels who ask for reconciliation seek reconciliation with the negro 7 Not at alh They enact that in South Carolina, Georgia and Missis' sippi be shall not own or hire a foot of land or a house. He shall come under his late master's threshold as u slave, or be homeless. The moment wc let up the South, they have clinched the negro. But the negro is our ally. He fought for our flag. SbaU-wc first give our life’s blood to subdue our enemies &sJ then basely buy a peace by handin'* over to them our allies for subjugation and enslave ment i This is the kind of peace Copperheads, end rebels vent—peace with all who can whip them, and leave to make war on &n whom they can whip. We scout and denounce snch afiimsy and pinchbeck peace as that. We abhor any rccondllaUon with'the whites of the South which must be purchased at the price of permitting them to have their own way vllh the freedmen. If they demand the . right to frame black cones depriving of laud, the npUt to tabor or to vote, we must frame Southern codes depriving the Southern whites of the same privileces. If : there is to be reconciliation between ns nnfl the Southern whites/there most bo also be* tween them and the* negroes—who have been our faithful allies from the outset. .Are they prepared for such a reconciliation? If so they hare repealed their "black codes and ceased to make war on the negro. Until they do this reconciliation is neither necessary-or desirable to ns. Our crops will wave luxuriantly, our coffers will flow with money, our marts will be filled with mer chandise, our politicians will obey the voice of the people, and all will go well with os In all respects If we shall be required for ten years to keep troops in all parts of the South to maintain the rights of the black citizens there resident. But the South will he lean and poor, her people hamny, suffering and ignorant, her politicians powerless and her voice silent; in short, her people perpetually prisoners and we tbrever on guard, until such a genuine reconciliation shall be effected. Bat to have equal rights with us they must give equal rights among their own people. This Is reconciliation. Anything else is slavery and slavery is war. Is the South ready for reconciliation? 

UTAH, For the energy, industry and business ca pacity of Brigham Young and his leading men in the Territory of Utah, we have the most profound respect. What they have ac complished in developing the resources of their productive valley and in bmlding their itcauthul city will command the admiration of auv intelligent men who visit Utah. We wish, therefore, to have a few kind words with “ President” Tonng—that is the title ac corded to him at home—and through him to bis people. Of course, they have not asked us for our advice, and possibly may spam it as Intrusive and impudent; but if adopted substantially, we believe It would contribute both to their welfare and prosperity. It cer tainly is given with the best possible inten tions. What we have to suggest is this: Lot Brigham Young and his peoplcprocnrc through their excellent Representative, Capt. Hooper, the passage of an enabling act with a clause prohibiting polygamy. When passed by Congress let him and bis people cordially adopt U. If President Young, In accordance with the suggestion of Speaker Colfax, can have a revelation forbidding polygamy In the future, eo much tbe better. Slavery having been abolished, the last dis turbing element in tbc nation will be remov ed. and our country wIU enter upon a career of prosperity and progressive development which wUi very soon surpass the wildest dreams of the most enthusiastic patriot, Secure of the respect and tbe kindest feelings of her sister Slates, Utah will In a very few years Dumber .half ■ a million of intelligent prosperous freemen, with a capacity for indefinite expansion in population and wealth. Salt Lake will soon become one of tbe largest and most prosper ous as It certainly is now one of the most beautiful cities upon tbc continent. Tbe mineral wealth of Utnh, and especially tbe vast gold and silver deposits of Idaho will make her. merchants and maniketurers princes, and command tor her people every elegance and luxury that money mt* pur chase. Utah may then aspire to, and attain Bwimij. her sister States any position her am bition may prompt in wealth,intelligence and refinement. •- . *■ And what If Utah docs not adopt this or some similar policy ? At the risk of having our well-intended suggestions construed into a threat, we say kindly but decidedly tliat Congress can never admit Utah as a State till polygamy la'abolished. More than that. Sooner or later. If the Mormons persist In the practise of their peculiar vice, they will bring on a collision with the Government. It may not come this year, or . next, hut . it is just as sure to come as anything whatever m the future.; Then, Instead of the prosper!.. ty end the happiness , which the policy we have suggested ’would "be sure to bring, must come desolation and the sword. The law against polygamy wilt never be repealed, and the time is not very remote when it must be severely and sternly executed. The Mormons themselves cannot dread and deplore that more than we_do. It would ha as -awful -ca lamity, which'may Heaven grant -Brigham Young andlls people the good sense and the patriotism to avert from themselves and the nation. JDaverylias gone down In a deluge of Wood; -may-the peculiar rice of Mormon-. fern go ont In a smcral JuMec of Joy and good wilb But what of the past. If Utah will adopt *Ld aiUifully execute a law against polyg-. omy, wc believe'the nation’ wbuld-aay with tie Savior, “go and sin no more/*-. Too, .it. moil twenty-five years, will close but the last vestige of polygamy,- for hy that time Brig inrn Young and Ms elder* will be gathered to their lathers. As to the Mormon religion, no one would think ol preventing -tho people of Utah from worshipping God according to the dictates of their own consciences. Let them, enjoy that till the end of lime—everything but their polygamy. Adopting thp-cotno we Lave suggested, Brigham -and hfc lecding men will occupy an enviable place la -thet history of the world. The ngly fact that and practised for bo many years a system In'defiance of the good opinion of all civilized nations, will be largely mitigated in admi ration forlhst stem self control which enabled them to forsake the errors of their ways to secure the peace'of the nation, and as the re sult will prove -to promote - their own best welfare. THE BLOOniNGTON 

CQHVEMIOK, A convention of farmers and merchants was held on Friday last at Bloomington, in this Slate, for the purpose, among other ' things, of considering the outrages which have been perpetrated on the producers of Illinois dur thepast two years by the railroad corpora tions of the Northwest. A full report of the proceedings of this Convention was published in the Tribune of Saturday, and those of our' merchants who hare not closely perused them, and who have been suffering on ac count of heavy slocks and light trade, had Letter devote An hour or two-ta this subject, without further delay. At the Convention blinded to there was quite a variety of subjects Introduced, nearly, all hearing on the transportation question; hut the leading topic discussed, and on which the greatest amount of indignation was ex pressed, was the freight extortion perpetrated on tbe producers of Illinois Jbr two years past by those who have had the management of the railroads" leading westward from Chi- CZgo- On this point, our correspondent tele graphs £5 as follows; Tear Ending May 1, 1865. “I ata sorry id bat it is a truth, that much of tbe iDdlensuos of tht»? men Is aimed against Chi cago. . IbcY believe that a Considerable preponder ance ol their wrongs. Have their origin in that city. Iherallroaas, orperhap* I should say the railroad combUmtiosß, which are i&e most offensive be cause tbe most unscrupulous, are believed to be large]; owned and mo>U; controlled by Chicago citizens, and-on ihe recompensing principle; tbere' are a numbci ofleadiDg merchants and agricultur ists acre from the Kormaesieni part of las State, who are determined if no remedy lor (helrwroa's is provided b; your dty, to turn their trade in the direction of St Lome. Ihej say that they will do so, -and 1 feel sure the; wilL River Qualities are ojten to St. Louis from a very largo leßiiory. much larger than yon would euppoeq, which has hcretoibre confined its business tnneadions to Chicago. The; annonnre their Intention to abandon (heir Chicaoo connec tions. and transfer them to their rival. - These are no unmeaning threats, but they will do what they say. These threats come particularly from Lea. Whiteside, Knox. Jlercer, Warren, Bcndcr-on and other Northwestern counties. This movement is not induced hr an; wrong coming from Chicago merchants. Their good came is in the months'of aD here, bnt they are compelled to protect them selves from tbe railroad anu irarcbonscmonopolies. I deem it essential that these frets should be known and appreciated by the Chicago business men, that they xaajrtake such action zi will arrest the calamity which hangs over - > . The truth, however, i» by no means lulf told in the above extract. There is not a large merchant doing business' within two hundred miles of Chicago but has lost thou sands faf dollars la consequence -of the actual mismanagement of railroad officials. They hare hot only , imposed on the people out rageous rates_of freight, but,they have neg lected thtir business by keeping back lumbar, merchandise, etc., for weeks, and even months, when there was no possible excuse for such delay. There is not a diy goods mercLtnt.or a lumber dealer in the city hut will hear us out in what. we say.. Fpr upwards of two years our lumbermen have had to dance attendance on the railroad offi cial®, day after day, and week after week, and beg for cars to cany.off the lumber which they have sold. As for the drygoods .merchants, they have been bbllged to send the great bulk of their goods by the “express companies,” which are nursed and fostered by those same £ railroad officials, at rates which are pcrieclly enormous. There are some of oar who have such strong falthjn of Chicago, tbatlhey may look upon all this indignation on tbcfpart of the people of the interior as a. mere temporary outburst; hut we warn our’ merchants against any such delusion. The people of the Northwest, are in earnest; and unless something is -3one to remedy the evils complained of, a_lorgc. proportion of our trade will seek other channels. Duringvthe' past two or throe months several znßUoos of dollars; have bear lost to; our city in con sequence of the scandalous proceedings of our railroad corporations; and pur. merchants, know well that' it is much "easier to keep trade than to get it back after iris loeU ' IThe Bloomiiretck Cckrcklidl their attention also to tbe subjoct'of new channels of water communication with the East and with Europe. The Niagara Falls Ship Canal and the Si. Lawrence River were embraced in the resolutions adopted by the Convention, and were discussed by tbe speakers with a de gree of intelligence and earnestness which mast cxciic the admiration of all who peruse the report of tbe proceedings. Such a con vention cannot fail to do good. It will com municate a galvanic shock to the public men of tbe country. It will set thousands of other people to thinking, who, not feeling the evils Ct tifi dialing embargo directly, would not otherwise be roused do-a -compre hension'of the common dongcK' threatening all Masses alike.■ It wiU give consistency and form to 3dcas which have long existed in the minds of Individual farmers and but bare hitherto found no public expression, save the columns of a few newspapers, which have counted the prosperity of the Northwest of more consequence ’ than tbe favors and patronage of a few railroad corpo rations.' It will send abroad an influence which will tell mightily upon the growth of the nation, for it Is impossible that the facts presented at Bloomington, of com rotting in the fields and being burned for fuel, fur lack of means to move it to those whose lives are a continued and unequal struggle wlfti hunger, shall fail of commanding the capital and skill to burst a new passage way to the ocean for tbe products of tbe Northwest. AK UIPOBmT JDKBATE. Tbc debate (which we publish elsewhere) on the resolution proposed by the House ap pointing a Joint Committee on Reconstruc tion, shows a deep sense, both by Senators and Representatives, of the responsibility which devolves on them, equally with the President, of deciding for themselves whether the States lately in rebellion are yet entitled to representation in Congress or not. Mr. Doolittle and a few others are bent on an im mediate admission of the Southern inembers, either from sympathy with the Sooth itself or from a desire to control the President’s pa tronage by making themselves his special fa vorites and flatterers. They would have pre ferred that the whole question of the admis sion of: Southern members should be one of credentials merely, and should be passed to the Committee on Credentials. Bat an over whelming majority of Congress holds it to be - their duty, -as an in dependent co-ordinate branch of the Government, to decide the' preliminary qnes* tions, whether the President’s pollcy'of recon struction Is Bound and. safe, whether the organizations claiming to be State Govern mentsin those States are republican In form, whether their’constitutions as adopted, their legislation, including their black codes, their elections, their degree of peace and order or the contrary—whether all these are consist ent with an immediate admission of their members Into Congress consistently with the safety of the Union and with tbe rights of all ihc people. Mr. Fessenden, one of the most cautions, sagacious, "and influential members of the Senate, in his able vindication of the dignity and lesponsibillty of a Senator, and his duty* whether agreeing or disagreeing with the ‘administration, to cast his vote on every measure according to his own convic tions of . right, administered by con trast a cutting rebuke to Mr. Doolittle. Probably In reply to the statement of the latter that Hr. Johnson’s reconstruction pol icy was-substantially that of Mr. Lincoln, Senator Fesscgdcn stated that he bad sus tained policies during war which he would not sustain during peace.; We can only infer that while Hr. Fessenden would excuse any little collateral Presidential experiments, though • somewhat irregular, unconstitu tional, or unwise, while the great question was the war for the Union, yet when this is settled, end the great and only business be fore the country is reconstruction, that then irregularity, unconslitutionality and a disre gard by the President of the prerogatives and power of Congress are no longer in order. The cowardice of Senator Doolittle in voting against the Joint committee, not because Con gress bad no business to inaairc into these matters, but because three more members were given to the House than to the Senate, Is not at all remarkable. Kow that this com mittee is appointed, the whole subject of re construction is fairly before Congress, and a most Interesting mass of information and ar gnment will be brought forward. A 

BLACK CODE MVAXLLED- We are glad to learn via.-Memphis that by orders' from Washington to Gen. Thomas, commanding the department which includes the Stale of Mississippi, the loiter officer is instructed to disregard, the- 11 Black- Code M of Mississippi, as passed by the late Leg&la. turc, under the title of “An Act to, confer civil rights upon freedmen." It would be a better mode of making public this fact and of preventing the wrongs contemplated by the' act, if Gen. Thomas would Issue a proclama tion declaring - ll "void,.laud -explaining the ' reasons why it is so treated. We recently set forth Us atrocious provisions In fall. They prohibit a negro from owning Or hiring lands,, houses or tenements anywhere in the State, prevent negroes from testifying in cases where negroes arc charged with offences against while men, oblige every negro to “have a-, lawful home,” *. t. a muter, on the second Monday of January, or they will hind him out, gives the master the right to recover a negro employed by hlmiclf If be runs awav and makes the cost of recovery payable out of the negro's wages, makes cohabitation between blacks eqrdva* lent to marriage, bat punishes a white man, not for cohabiting with, but for marrying a black woman, and punishes any white man for hiring or harboring a negro already hired by any other white man. The sole object ot the code is to re-cnslave the negro, and if per mitted to go into effect It would dp so most .effectually. Away wlth such barbarism. By' the time we have set aside the bungling legis lation of the Southern whites- lor a year or two, we shall be.ready ,to_let_ the negroes try their band. Thcycertalnlycannot do worse, and may do better. ’ • Tbe €be<M flaken.'

FROM WASHINGTON. First Stage of the Reconstruction Ques tion in tbe senate. [From our own Correspondent.] WAsjnjroTOS,*J>ec. 12.1865. The last two days hare been fruitful of portentous developments. Until yesterday It was Impossible to define the exact -position tbe Union majority In the Senate would assume la regard to the reconstruction question. A haze of uncertainly as to the views of Indi vidual members obscured the prospect and prevented any clou: vista of the future. There was busy inquiry and ogiUtlon, active private counseling, indefinite conjecture, hap hazard prognostication; but facts, votes, for mal aggregations of parties and factions were wanting.' At this writing all is changed. The previous fermentation has. brought, well-de fined certainties to the suriacc. By the light of yesterday’s and to-day’s doings one can see the way ahead. Tbe first stage of the solution of the reconstruction problem has been reached and passed- The greatest dan ger—precipitate -action—has been ‘ avoided," and, though the en£ cannot as yet be acea,- ' there Is ground for Increased hope' and coafl-’ denre that all will go well. The great point of interest was the expect ed action of the Senate upon the House rcso loUbnfora Committee, of. Fifteen upon the reunions Slates." Rumors as to'prdbable de jections of this and that Republican Senator, had been thick for several days, and the.de-. ddonof the Senatorial Union.caucus upon this subject, on yesterday, was looked for ■with much anxiety. The caucus had two sittings; one in the morning and another In' the afternoon. Owing to the Wftmt of time, no conclusion was reached at' the former;' the latter continued for several hours, and ■ was of an anlmatcd*and Interesting character. The majority of. the Senators present- were opposed to the adoption of the resolution as/ It came from the House,. but though object-' lug to Its form, agreed.with iu spirit Only three Senators, Messrs. Doolittle, Dixon and Cowan,, advocated its entire Of these, Mr. Doolittle mode the strongest oppo sition. {All three showed unmistakably that - .they would not co-operate with the majority in the'enactment of any measures bearing” upon reconstruction not In strict accordauce* with the views of the President.” laaddlilon to the outright antagonism of the mentioned three conservatives par excellence, there came perceptibly less marked, yet sufficiently dis tinct ’ TiwxStiCw • of oplqics, . between Messrs. "Wilson,. Sumner, Howard, IVudc, and others of radical complexion on the one ride, asd-Mcssi*. Trumbull, Fes senden, Harris” dud Morgan cs The former indicated an uawiUlngoess to ad mit representatives from the rebel States without the strictest and mostycomprchcn sire guaranties of loyalty, riddance of every' vestige of slavery and rebellion, and justice to the freed people, while. tho l&Ucr seemed to be disposed to concede more, and enact less rigorons conditions. However, this dlfierencc: of shade of opinion was not decided enough to warrant apprehensions of an eventual segre gation of the Union majority into’t wowlngs, * that might give tbe opposition tbe balance of power.. On the contrary, sach a spirit of mutual forbearance and concession was mani fested by all present, with the three exceptions mentioned, that for the present, at least, all fearaof aspUtmay be ■ There was no Irritation, no harshness of remark, no se vere clashing of arguments—nothing hut the most amicable exchange of views.. I am su specific In this statement, inasmuch as .errone ous reports of the character of the proceedings •f the caucus have got abroad, that may pro duce unnecessary uneasiness la the public mind. ■ .' * Several forms of amendment were Intro duced. After a somewhat protracted discus sion, it was agreed by tbc majority 'to amend the resolution by making it a concurrent in. stead of Joint resolution and striking out the part, binding both Houses not to receive any members from . the. so-called Confederate States until the Joint committee had reported and to refer all papers relating to the teprel sentation of said States to the committee with, out debate- It was the Sense of the majority that this part infringed upon the Constitu tional privilege of the Senate to decide ques tions of admission independent of the House, and open the absolute freedom of discussion upon all subjects, which the Senate basal* ways adhered to with traditional jealousy. For these and no other reasons these amend ments prevailed in the caucus. The House resolution was taken up in the. Senate to-day upon motion of Mr- Anthony, who also offered the amendments . agreed upon in the cau cus. It was expected that a prolonged debate would be sprung by the opposition. , But tbc Democratic Senators, with more wis dom than professed Republicans, offered no resistance to the passage of the resolution. The only serious opposition was made by the conservative trio, Messrs. Doolittle, Dixon and Cowan. Mr. Howard opened by arguing the views advanced In the'caucus by him. self and the more radical Senators. Hr. Doo little followed with s blustering speech, characterized by overstatements of facts and bis usual weakness for exaggeration. His unprovoked personal attack on Mr. Stevens' was in very bad taste. His presumption in putting himself forward as the particular friend and champion of the Executive, and his subservient theory that Congress was in duty hound to act in accordance with the 1 policy of the President, and to look to the Executive alone for information, to guide Its legislation concerning the rebel States, was. promptly and properly rebuked by Mr. Fes senden in his habitual quiet yet impressive manner. As you will no doubt print the de bate in fbll, I will only add that Mr. Fcssen*’ •den’s concluding remarks deserve particular ' attention. They Jorcshadownot only Lis own future course, but may be taken’as an indica tion of that of Senators’ Trumbull, Harris? Morgan and others of moderate views. The ultimate passage ot the House resolu tion by the Senate with the amendments prol posed by Mr. Anthony constitutes an Im portant step in the reconstruction process. For It is‘already understood this evening that the majority of the House will to-morrow agree to the Senate amendments. And, aside from its legislative bearing, It has had the good effect in the Senate of settling, at least for tbc time being, the respective posi tions of leading Republican Senators in re gard to reconstruction. -It has shown that executive influences have not ,‘ts yet great weight with the Republican majority, that no “administration party” of formidable strength can be formed from among it; that Messrs. Doolittle, Dixon, and Cowan, may be considered as fully arraigned on the oppo sition side; cud that more than two-thirds of the Senate can be relied on os sound as to the said issues involved in reconstruction.

The motion was agreed to, and the Senate proceeded to consider the following resolution irom the Bouse of- Representatives: Be if retell e Ihy the Senate and JJouit of Seprt* rmtctifte in Concrete cttmUed, That a Joint com mluoo of fifteen member* shall be appointed, ulna of whom shall be members of tbe Hooae ana «!x members of the tf enale, who aboil inquire ln*o the condhloaot the State* which formed the so-ailed Confederate States of America, and report whether •tbey,oranyofibem, are entiled to be represented In either Bense cf Congrera; with leave to report at any time, by bill or otherwise; and .until such - report ehaii hare been made, and finally acted on by Congress, no member shall be received into’ cither Bocae irom any of the said so-called Confeder ate blstM; and aUpapera relating to the represen tation of raid States shall bo referred to the said committee without debate. * Mr. Anthont— I move to emend tbe en acting danse of the resolution, which now reads as a joint resolution, so as to make U a concurrent resolution: inasmuch as a joint resolution goes to the President for his signa ture.! . The amendment was agreed to. ■ Mr. Antuont—l move further to amend tbe resolution by striking out all after the word, “otherwise.” - The words proposed to be stricken out were read, os.follows; . . “And until such report shall have been made, and finally acted on by Congre«e, no member shill be received into cither House from say ol the said so-caUed Coofederatetitstea; sud all papers pelailiur to ihexepresentaUoh o! ertd Sutes shall he referred to the eaid committee without debate.” ! SJCfiTOB DOWAim’a HBMARKa. Mr.'HowAßo—Mr. President, I cannot vote for that amendment. I prefer the resolution as it came from the House of Representatives, because, whether the concurrent resolution has orhos not the effect of law, U certainly contains within itself a pledge on the part of the two Houses, given the one to the other, that until the report of this important com mittee shall have been presented, we will not ro-admit any of the rebel. Stales, either by, recognition of their Senators or by theur Representatives. I think, sir, the country expects nothing less than this at our hands. I think that portion of the loyal people of the United States who have sacrificed so much of blood and treasure In the prosecu tion of; the war, and who secured to us the signal victory which we have achieved over the rebellion, bare a right to at least this assurance at our band*, that neither House of Congress-irQ recognize .as States any one of the rebel States nnul the event to which I have alluded. . . • Sir, what is the present position, and ttalut of the rebel States? In my judgment they are simply conquered communities, sub jugated by the arms of tbe United States— communities In which the right of self-gov ernment does not now exist.' Why ?. Be cause they have been for the lost four years hostile,: to the. most surprising unanimity hostile, to the authority ot the United States, and have during that period been waging a ■ bloody war against that authority. They axe simply conquered. communities; and we hold them, as we know well, us the world kuo'ws to-day, not by their own free wUlami con sent as members of the Union, but solely by virtue of our superior military power, which is exerted to that efiect throughout tho length and breadth of the rebel States. There is In those States no rightful authority, ac cording to my view, at this time butlhat of the United States, and every political act, every governmental act exercised within thclf limits, must necessarily bo exercised and performed under the sanction and by tbo will of the conqueror. In short, sir, they are not to-day loyal States ; their population are not willing to day, if wc are rightly Informed, to perform ; peaceably, quietly, and efficiently the duties which pertain to the population of a State la the Umbn and of the Union ; and for one, 1 cannot consent to recognize them, even In directly, as entitled to be represented In either House of Congress at this time. The time has not yet come, la my Judgment, to do -thus,-and I object to the amendment for the reason that It leaves the implication—and the Implication will be drawn and clearly under* 'stood by tho'public— that one or the other House of Congress may, whenever It sees fit, readmit Senators and Representatives from a rebel State as it sees fit, without the concur *rtncc of the other House, and I bold it to be .utterly incompetent for tbe Senate, under the present condition of things, and for the House of Representatives, same condition, to a Vita! t Senators or Representatives into Congress without the consent of both Houses and tho formal recognition of the tact that hostilities have ceased and that loyaltv la re stored in the rebel States. I think, sir, that under present circum stances'll Is due to the country that wo cbculd give them the assurance, such as the lioubo of Representatives has given in tbe resolution they have sent to us, that wo will -cot thus hastily readmit to seats In the legis lative bodies here tbe representatives of con stituencies who are still hostile to the author ity of the United Stales, and unwilling to co .ci«ratu with us In our legislation. 1 think, sir, that such constituencies are not entitled to be represented here. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment now pending. senator Doolittle’s remarks. X:. L 4 ?Cl*’ rr^c-r 3!r. President: under oilier circumstances peruZpt 1 ahnnid say nothing upon this motion or the honorable Senator!from Rhode Island to amend the revelation of the House of Representatives; but as the honorable Senator Irom Michigan makes earnest objection to the adoption of the amendment, and bos demanded the yeas and nay* of the Senate upon it, I certainly am not onlv at liberty to express my views, -bat I feel that to do so is a duty to myself; to the Senate, and to the country; and I shill discharge. that doty In as brief terms as X can. | In my own lodgment, sir, all of these great questions concerning reconstruction, pacifica tion, and restoration of civil government in the Southern States, representation in this body, or anything which concerns oar Feder al relations with the several States, .ought to he referred to the Committee on the Judi ciary. , Snch has been the practice of this government from the beginning. Great qaes lions of constitutional law. questions concern ing the relations of the Union to the States and the Stoles to the Union, and above all, and without any exception, all questions re lating to representation In this body, tolls membership, have always been referred to the Jndiciory Committee. • , . .. • ♦ : Mr. President, there is another provision in ■ this resolution as it stands. - It not only takes from the Senate oil'power to act over this subject until this committee shall report oml Congress shall take final action, hut it de clares that v e shall refer every paper to the committee without debate. Yes, sir, theScn ate of-the United States is to be led like a lamb to. the slaughter, bound hand and foot, shorn of its constitutional jower, andgagged, dumb, like the sheep brought to the block! Is this tbc condition' to which the Senator from Michigan proposes to rednee the Senate of the United Stales by insisting upon such .a provision as ihal contained In the resolution as it comes Irom the House of Representa tives? . ... Hr. President, there is a still graver objec tion to this resolution as U stands. The pro vision that, “until such reports shall have been made and Anally acted on by Congress, no member shall be received In cither House from any of tbc so-called Confederate States,” is a provision which, by law, excludes those eleven Siaifx from their representation in the Union. .Sir, pass that resolution as It stands, and let it receive the signature of the Presi dent, and you have accomplished what the rebellion could not accomplish, what the sac rifice of half a million men could not accom plish in warring against this Government— you hare dissolved Vie Union by ad of Air, are irf prepared to.sanction thatt 2 trust never. ■ The Senator from Michigan talks about the riff/us of.tbese States. He may very properly raise the question whether .they have any Leg islatures Inal arc capable of electing Senators to this body. That is a question offact to be considered; bnt as to whether they ore and States still within the Union, notwitn standing their civil form of government has been overturned by. the rebellion and their Legislatures have been disorganised —that they are still States In this Union is the most sacred truth and the dear est truth to every American heart, and it will.be maintained by the American people iagainst all opposition, come from what quarter it may. sIK the flag that now floats on the top of the Capitol bears thirty six stars. Every star represents a State In Ibis Union. I ask the Senator from Michi gan, does that flag, os it floats there, speak tbc nation’s truth to our people and to the world, or is it a hypocritical flaunting Us That flag has been borne at the head of our conquering legions through the'whole South, planted at Vicksburg, planted at Columbia, Savannah, Charleston, Sumter; the. same old flag which came down before tbe rebellion at Sumter was raised up again, and it still bore tbc same glorious stars* “not a star ob scured,” not cue. *' Mr. FesFE.VDex—Were not some of those stars obscured f Hr. Doolittle—No.. sir. These people have been disorganized m their civil govern ments in consequence of the war; the rebels overturned civil government In the first place, and we entered with our armies and captured the rebellion; but did that destroy the states? Not at all. We entered the States to save them—-not to destroy them. Our constitu tional dnty Is to save them, and save every v one of them, and not to destroy them. The guaranty in the Constitution Is a guaranty to the States, and to every one of the States, and the obligation that rests upon us is to guarantee to Sooth Carolina a repub lican form of government as a State in this Union, and cot as a Ter ritory. The doctrine of the territorial condi tion of these States, that they are mere, conquered, subjugated territories, as it we* had conquered Canada or Mexico, will not stand argument for a moment. It is utterly at war with the ground on which we stand and have stood from the beginning. The ground wo ocenpled was this: that no State nor the people of any State bad any power to withdraw from the Union. They could not do it peacefully; they undertook to do It by arms; we crushed the attempt; we trampled their armies under our feet; we captured the rebellion; the States arc ours; and we en tered them to save and not to destroy. Mr. President, Ido not wish to be drawn now into the discussion of these questions at length. I may have on opportunity bn some other occasion to. do so. I simply now am stating the objections which I baa to this res* elation as It came from the House of Repre sentatives. It degrades the Senate; it robs it of its Constitutional power; its pats the con trol of a question which Is exclusively ours into the hands of the other House; It dis solves the Union by law of Congress. jlr. president, I have no idea the Hooso of Representatives had any such Intention. lam bound always to speak with respect of the House of Representatives and of the inten-. lions of that body.' I simply say— . The President pro tempore .- The Choir will suggest that It Is not within the rules of order for the proceedings of the House of Re presentatives to be discussed here. Mr. Doolittle. \V°old It be in order to mike a statement that the resolution vu passed wtbont debate in the other House ? The Psmipknt pro Umport. The Chair thinks not- - lir. Docltrlk. That Is aU I designed to sty, that Itpaswd that House wUhontdehate. I do not meas any disrespect to the House. But, Hr. President, there was another as semblage In Washington which tookpkeenot long since, aid whose proceedings are pub lished to the world and known to all men, of which I suppose I can speak with entire free dom; Ircicrto a certain assemblage whose proceedings are published as the proceedings of a caucus of gentlemen in the city of Wash ington. I suppose no rule of tbe Senate re quires me to speak in any othertenu&of those published proceedings than to speak the truth. To that lam willing to bo-bound. By Ibo published proceedings of.that assemb-. lace, it would seem that on a Saturday night, without any discussion whatever, a resolution, which reads, word Ibr.word just like this resolution which Is sent, here from the House of Representatives, was adopted in that caucus under the leadership of a cer tain gentleman—l will not speak of him as a member of the House, but os a man known to history—who resides In the State of Penn sylvania. X refer to Hon. Thaddous Stevens. JUs his tory is known to all men; and one thing we know of him certainly, that hols most bitter ly, imcompromL-IDRIy hostile to the policy of the present Administration on the subject of reconstruction. He goes with him who goes the ihrlhest, bolding that even the State of Tennessee is an alien State at war with the United States; and If lam notmlfilaformed, In the Convention at Baltimore, which nomi nated Alessrs. Lincoln and Johnson for Prcai- dent mid Vice President, ho objected to .the nomination of Andrew Johnson because be was an alien enemy! Sir, Ibaveseen nothing in ihe.blstorj of that gentleman to lead me * to suppose that he bas in any respect changed his opinions, for it Is not long since wo read a speech of his delivered in the State of Penn sylvania,'marked with his usual ability, with his great' boldness, with that cool assurance' whichsomethnes rises almost to tho sublime, in which ho * proposed, If 1 do not mistake, almost the entire and -universal confiscation of tbe whole of tboSootbern States. Now, Mr. President, of the doings of that assemblage in connection with tbe resolution 1 feel at perfect liberty to speak without vio lating the .rules of. this House.. 1 will not speak with disrespect even of that assem blage ; I have not done so ; I do not Intend to do so. 1 simply say that within three min utes, by tbe clock, alter the hour when that assemblage was called, Thaddcns Stevens bad moved his committee on resolutions and was withdrawing with his committee from tie body to make his report, and within ten minutes, without any discussion, without any consideration whatever, it was by that cool l£ct and talent of his pressed through the" body and tlCclirdd'lpbeufi&nSmoasly adopted. Why this hot haste, sir ? What necessity of this hot haste ? Who does not know that the leader of that assemblage did not desire to wait, nor did be dare to wait, until the Presi dent had spoken to the country in his annual message. The Constitution of tho United Stales re quires (be President from time to time to give to Congress information ol tho state of the Union.- Who has any right to presume that tho President will not furnish tho information, which his constitutional duty requires ? He has at his control oil the agencies which are necessary. There is the able Cabinet who surround him, with all the officers appointed' under them; the Postmasters under the Post office Department, tho Treasury agents under the Treasury Department, and almost two bundled thousand men under the control of the War Department In every part of this “ disaffected*' region, who can bring to tho President information from every quarter of all the transactions that exist there. Why, I ask, bad this assemblage the right to presume , thatrthe President would not furnish the lu . formation which tho Constitution required ? Sir, wc are here claiming to be the friends of tho lato lamented President, and the friends of him upon whom by his: death the responsibilities ol power have fallen. Wo aided in their election.'-They were nomin ated ot Baltimore after the great experiment of, reconstruction had : already begun. Mr. Lincoln'bad already for months, for almost a year, been pursuing substantially tbe same policy of reconstruction which jus since been followed by bis successor. Andrew Johnson was himself one'of the agencies which bad been employed by Mr. Lincoln in tbe State ot Tennessee. In the hope of restoring civil gov ernment’tucre; and it was under these cir cumstances, not with the approval of all men at Washington, but with the approval of the great masses of the people of this country, that Abraham Lincoln was renominated os President, and. that Andrew Johnson was nominated, to be Vice , President of the United States, and they were tri umphantly indorsed and sustained by tho people; and I tell Senators now, in my opin ion—l ppe&k with ail respect-to other gentle men—that the President ofthe United States will be sustained, in the views which be lakes In his message, by the people of this country, is os certain as tho revolution* of the earth; and it is our duty to act harmoniously with him, to sustain hint, to hold up bis hoods, to strengthen his heart, to speak to him words of faith, friendship and courage. • Mr. President, I know that in'all these Southern States there are a thousand ■ things to give .us pain, sometimes alarm, bat not withstand the bad appearance which .from, time to time presents itself In the' midst of ■that boiling caldron of passion ant excitement which the war has left still raging there, the real progrera which -w*. Rave mado has been most wonder (hi.

SENATOR JtSSENDEN’S REMARKS. . Mr. FrssEXDEf—Mr. President, lam very sorry that this debate Las sprung; up. I think It exceedingly out of place, with regard to the mannerln which it has been conducted, and some of the todies which have been spoken of. 1 do not, ia saying this, wish to oe considered as finding fault with any gen* tlcman, because every Senator must judge for himself as to what it Is advisable for him to say, and it is not for any other Senator to arraign him on that point. But It sometimes happens that things which are foreign to the question arc said which ought not to be suf fered to pass without a little comment. . Now, sir, allow me to say that, when this resolution was first promulgated in the news- Krs ns having been agreed upon,! approved caa^lsympathized witbits object and purpose! I did not examine it particularly: but, looking simply at what U was designed for, it met my approbation simply for this rea son: that this question of the rcadmisslon, If you please to call It so, (it Is not worth while to stand about words,) of these confed erate States, so called, and all the questions connected with that subject, I conceived to be of infinite importance, requiring calm and serious consideration, and I believed that the appointment of a committee, carefully select* cd by the two Houses, to take that subject into consideration, was not only wise in itself, but au imperative duty resting upon the rep* rcsentativesof the people in the two branches of Congress. For myself, I was not prepared to act upon that question at once, iam not' one of those who pin their faith upon anybody, however eminent in position, or conceive themselves obliged on a question of great national importance to follow oat anybody’s opinions simply because he is in a position to make those opinions, perhaps, somewhat more Imperative than any other citizen of the Republic. Talk about the Administration! Sir, we arc a part of the Administration, and a very important port of it. I have no Idea of abandoning the prerogatives, the. rights, and the: duties of my position la favor of anybody, however that person or any number of persons may desire it. In saying this, lam not about to express an opinion npon the subject any farther than I have expressed it, and that Is, that in questions of such infinite importance os this, involving.the Integrity ana welfare of the Republic in all iutnrc time, we arc solemnly boned, and onr con* etltuents will demand ofus, that we examine them with care and fidelity, and tut on our own convictions, and not upon the convictions of others. • I have said I was In favor of this resolution when I >first read it, for the reason that It looked to a purpose which-1 approve—calm and deliberate consideration before action; but when I came to read It- over more carefully, and hear the opinions of others, I came to the conclusion, for the reasons that have been given roy honorable Mend' from • Rhode island, that the resolution perhaps went a little too far. It was important to have a committee by which this subject should he investigated, composed of members of the two houses, for the reason,- among others, that It Is very Important that .the two booses should act in - harmony, that one house' should not take action that would be at variance with • the action. of the other, and that) after investigation of the subject, it wonld result, os I believe, from the conslun-. tion of Congress, that the two Houses wonld act In harmony, on the same principles, and with the,same views, and neither would act hastily. ■ Therefore, the committee was im portant, and a committee that should be care fully chosen, as I said before.and deliberate well and advise well ; and I did not conceive that a little delay, that a few weeks’ time, or even a few months’ time, if necessary, given to that subject,- would he misspent. We had better spend a little time now than take a step to ue repented of la ail onr after lives ana in an the future life of the Republic. * * * . * • •** My Wend from Michigan [Mr. Howard] will allow me (osar to him that I do not think, the question of whether the men who may {irescot themselves as members arc fit to come n now, or whether the Stales of which they profess to be the representatives are fit to romc in sow and act with us and ought to be admitted to do so, is involved m this question! at all. He has argued it as if by striking but tbls portion of the resolution we had settled that. By no manner of means. If It would do so, I would vote with him. We are only settling, on the contrary, that that question shall be deferred until a committee of both branches have thor oughly considered it-and reported to this body; and certainly I shall go with him ns long as I believe that committee Is doing Its duty in opposing action upon tbc subject com mitted to it until It is ready to enlighten ns with tbc Information It may have received and the conclusions to which it may have arrived. I say this simply to bar the inference that by this action in amending it any one who may vote for it means to say or intimate that he u ready to act upon that question now and ad mit anybody from any of these so-called Confederate States. Certainly I am not one of them, and yet I shall rote with the hon orable Senator from Rhode Island. -• On the other band, I do not agree with the honorable Senator from Wisconsin that by passing a simple resolution raising a commit tee of our own body, and- referring-to U cer tain papers, if we conclude to do so, we are infringing upon the rights of anybody or mak ing on Intimation with regard to any poller that the President may hare seen fit to adopt and recommend to the coontrj. Sir, I fruit there are no such things as exclusivefriends of the President among vs, or gentlemen 1 to be ta considered. 1 have as much respect for the President ctf the VnUed Btatet croooMu as any man. ladedvithhim faiff, aud Imi&t express* the favorable opinions icMch 1 entertain »J him here if they 'would not be out of plats tndin bad tastein this body. That lam posed and ready to support him to the best of jay ability, as every gentleman aronnd me is,-, la pood faith and with kind f ecUng- In ail that he may desire that Is consistent with my views of duty to the country, giving him ere dlt for Intentions as good as mine, and with ability far greater, I am ready to asseverate. But, sir, Jdo not ajpeevith the doctrine; ant Jdesire to enter my distent to U noioandhere, I hat, because a eertam Hne of potty has been' . adopted-b}f one'-hratieh'of ihe-Government, or~ Kriain tievs are entertained by one branch of » Government , therefore;for (hat reason alone tnd none other, thatia to be. tried, even {f it is ogainst piy judgment; and I do not say that Ills or Is not. That ta'a question to be con sidered. I have a great respect, not for my self, perhaps, but for the position which I bold as a Senator of the United States; and no measure of Government, no pollcy of the President, or of the bead : of. a De partment, shall pass me, while I am - a Senator. If I . know_it,_ until I have examined It and given my assent to it; not on account of the source from which It emanates, but. on account of Its own In-- . trinsic, merits, and because-1 -believe it will result in the goodof my. country. That is my dnty os a Senator, and 1 fear no mis constructional home on thissabjector-any others x have represented tbe Slate fi;om which I come "too long to fear anything of that bind. If I act against the prejudices or preconceived opinions of that.people, they are always ready to hear.mo, andhear.my reasons, and if they are satisfactory, to them, to giro mo credit for them, and, if not satis factory, at least to -give me credit for good Intentions; and that uaU.laafc.ot anybody. Now, therefore, sir, I hope that, laying aside all thesematters which are entirely foreign, we shall act upon this resolution simply, as a matter of business. No one has a right to complain of itthat wo raise a com mittee for certain purposes of our. own when -we Judge it to bo necessary. It Is an Imputa tion upon nobody; it Is an insulttd nobody; It Is not-anythiog-wlueh any sensible'man could ever And fault with, or be disposed to do so. It is our judgment; our deliberate judgment, our friendly Judgment—a coarse of action; adopted from regard 'io' the good of the community, and .that good of the com munity comprehends the good of every indi vidual in It. - •- - • " ■ Ailow mo to eay, sir, in ~ closing, on© thing which I may os well say now In toe beginning of tho session, because It Is the principle which 1 intend shall-golde-my- action, and I hope Will guide the acilon_of oil of os. Wo bavo just -gone through r a state ot. war. ■While we were In It It oecame 'necesaw .n around to do certain thing* for which per haps no strict warrant win be found; con trary, at any rate,- to-previous-erpericnco. That I admit most distinctly, Sir, I defended. them from .the ■ 1 laid down the. principle that the man who, placed In a posi tion such os the President ana other officers occupied, would not, in a time of war, and when this country was In peril, put his own reputation at hazard os readily as be would anything else In -order to do his duty, was not lit for bis-place. : I-upheld many things then that perhaps 1 would not uphold now, because they are not necessary. The .timemusteoinowhen the Scnate auuHouse of Representatives, the Congress,'must revert to Its own original position. Ido not think there will be tho slightest danger; I have no apprehension of an;; but if 1 act upon dif ferent principles now and hereafter io a state of peace, from those which T adopted and delt-ndcd before, I wish everybody to nnder stauu the reason for it; In all countries, in all nations in a time of extreme peril, ex treme and somewhat questionable measures are inevitable. . • Mi. Johnson— I The Senator does not under stand me as bolding a different doctrine, because 1 maintained that on the floor ol Uiq Senate. Mr. Fessenden—l trust not. But la time of peace, when we Jive under a written Con stitution, It is our duly to come back as fast as possible; to. forget, If necessary, any pro-' cedent which might, ft mado in times like these, have occasioned very serious difficulty aud troubled hoyr, sir, I have said this; it la as much out of place as 1 anything I complained of In other gentlemen;-but I took the occasion simply because It presented . itself; and It would seem somewhat connected with what has taken place. I trust we shall adopt the amendment proposed by the honorable Sena tor from Rhode Island, and I believe that If the resolution be passed in that form It will accomplish ail It is desirable to accomplish and be entirely saliaihctory. Mr. Howabiv—At tbe suggestion of some of my friends I withdraw the call for tho yeas and nays. 

SENATOR TRUMBULL’* REMARKS. * » ,* Ms. Tscanrailb—We nil know that the State organizations In certain States of the Union hare been usurped. and overthrown.' This Is a fact of which wo most officially take notice. There was a time when the Senator from Indiana, [Ur. Hendricks] os well as myself, would not have thought of receiving a Senator from the Legislature or what purported to be the Lcgislature'of South Carolina. When the people of that State, by their representatives, undertook to with draw from the Union and set up an inde pendent coveromtutfe that Slate in hostility to the Union, when' tho body aclln.° , _»*-A Legislature there ' was avowedly acting against this (Totpnubcnt, neither he nor.l wouldhavercucivea representatives from it. That was a usurpation which by force of arms wo have pul don e. Now tho question arises,' has a State government slnco been Inaugura ted there entitled to representation ? Is not that a fair subject of inquiry f Ought we not to be satisfied upon that point ? we do not make such on Inquiry In reference: to mem bers that come from Slates which have never , undertaken to deny their allegiance to the Government of tho United States. ..Having , once been admitted as States, they continue 1 eo until,'.by come positive act they throw off their allegiance, and assume on attitude of hostility:!© tho Government, and make war upon It;! and while la that condition 1 know we should all object that they, of course, could not be represented in the Congress of the United States. Now, Is it not a proper subject for Inquiry to ascertain whether they have assumed a position In harmony with the Government; and Is it not proper that that inquiry should be made the subject of Joint action? ■ • ’ 1 think we could get at U in another wayos well perhaps as by this Joint committee- We could, by instituting a committee of onr own, or by referring this subject to a committee of onr own, have It investigated and have o reso lution reported, os was done by the Judiciary Committee of the Senate last session when a report was made, not in favor of admitting toscats the persons claiming seats and who presented credentials, but in ftvorof recog nizing na legitimate and lawful,-and entitled to representation,' ah organization which was set up after the rebellion had been put down Id one of the rebel States. If that resolution had been passed by the Senate, tt would have gone to the House of Representatives,and In that way we should have had concurrent ac tion.- I’think we might have it without this joint committee, and perhaps quite as well: but the House of Representatives have desired a joint committee on this subject; wc all de sire joint action, co-operation. AU the friends of the Union, all men who desire to see har mony and good feeling restored between all parts of the Union, must -desire harmonious action between the different branches of Con-' gress and all departments of the Government. The House or Representatives thought In sending os this resolution, that the best way to accomplish that was through a joint com mittee. |if I supposed that it divested the Senate of Us constitutional prerogative to lodge of the elections, returns, and'qualifica tions of its members, I could not support It. 1 never would have supported this resolution as it came from the House of Representatives, because if would not bear investigation. It is not snsccplihl&ln my Judgment, of the construction which my friend from Rhode Island in his liberality was disposed to put upon It,.when he suggested that It might be questionable whether credentials went to this committee. . As the resolution was burned, and as it camo from the House of Represen tatives, It provided that until a report shall have been made by this committee and finally acted on by no member shall be received into either House from any of the so-called Confederate Slates,” expressly pro viding that no member shall bo received in either Hoaso; ” and all papers relating to the representation of said States , shall he re ferred to said committee without debate,” sending the credentials to a Joint committee; that is, raising a committee of the two Houses to determine whether persons wonld be enti tled to seats in either House, which would certainly be a very extraordinary proceeding, and one hot warranted by the Constitution. Rat as the resolution Is altered, I do not think it susceptible of the construction which the Senator from Indiana pats npon It. I should bare said nothing bnt for his remarks, and I have only said ‘this much to preclude the Idea that I would vote for a resolution which took from either House the constitu tional prerogative which the Constitution In express terms has conferred-: ■ The Pbesidext pro tempore . -' The question is on concurring In the resolution as amended, npon which the yeas aud nays have been or- , dcred. i The question being fakcn~by yeas and nays, rcsnltcd-r-yeas S3, nays II; as follows: Yr*p—Mewi*.

FBOM CAIItO. Affray In Cairo—A Gambler Killed—'The Steamer Darling Sunk—Cuming of tbo Steamer Decries* Valuable Dorse* aud Freight Consumed. (Speoa) Despatch to the Chicago Tribune.) Camo, Dee. IC. A difficulty occurred here this morning between a professional gambler of this city named Dennis Keith and Commander Cartlott, of the monitor Oneota. Keith was shot to death by Bartlett, who now stands charged with manslaughter. The steamer Darling Is sunk, or In a sinking con dition, at Plnm Point, Mississippi river.
