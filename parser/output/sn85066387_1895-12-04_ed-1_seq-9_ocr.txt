circulation in addition to that already outstanding, amounting to 178,000,000. which would nearly or quite equal the currency proroiedto be canceled. any event I should confidently expect to see the existing National banks, or others to be organ ized avail themselves of the proposed encourage ments to issue circulation and promptly (ill any vacuum and supply every currency needed. It hasalwavs seemed to me that me provisions of law regarding the capital of National banks, which ODerate as a limitation to their Location, fail to mnke proper compensation for the suppression of State banks, which come near to the people in all sections 01 the country 'and readily furnish them wiih banking accommodations and facilities. SAnv inconvenience or embarrassment arising from these restrictions on the location of -National bunks ni-ht well bereniedled by better adapting the present system to the creation , ot banks In smaller communities, or by permitting banks of hirse capital to establish branches in such loca- | tions as would serve the people so regulated and , restrained to secure their safe and conservative i control p.nd management: but there might not be the necessity for such an addition to the currency ' by new issues of bank circulation as at first glance is indicated. If we should be relieved from main taining .i gold res rye under conditions that con stitute It.the barometer of our solvency would rise, ami if our treasury shuuld no longer be the foolish purveyor of gold for nations abroad or for specula tion Hini hoarding by our citizens at home, I should expect to see told resume its natural and normal functions in the business affairs of Jthe country and erase to be an object attracting the timid or our people and exciting their sensitive imaginations. I do not overlook the fact that the cancellation of treasury notes issued under the silver-purchas ir.','iict oi 1890 would leave the treasury in the actual ownership of sufficient silver, including seigniorage, to coin nearly f1 78,000,000 in stan dard dollars. It Is worthy of consideration whether this might not from time to time be con verted into dollars or fractional coin and slowly put into circulation as, in the judgment of the Sec retary of the Treasury, the necessity ot the coun try should require. "Whatever is attempted should be entered upon fully appreciating the fact that by careless, easy descent we have reach* d :t danger ous depth, and that our ascent will not be accom plished without laborious toil and struggle. We shall be wise If we realize that we are financially 111 and that our restoration to health may require heroic treatment and unpleasant remedies. In the present stage of ourdifticulty it is not easy to understand how the amount of our revenue re ceipt -.directly affect it. The important question is no: the amount of money received in revenue payments, but the kind of money we maintain and our ability to continue in sound financial condi tion. We are considering the Government's hold inesof gold as related to the soundness of our money and as affecting our National credit and monetary strength. If our gold reserve had never been impaired or if no bonds had ever been issued to replenish it, if there had been no fear and timid ity concerning our ability to continue gold pay ment. if any part of our revenues were not paid in gold, and If we could look to our gold receipts as a meaus of maintaining a safe reserve, the amount of our revenues would be an influential fac.or in the problem, but unfortunately all the circum stances that might lend weight to this considera tion are entirely lacking in our present predica ment. No gold is received by the Government in payment of revenue charges, nor would there be if the revenue were increased. The re ceipts of the treasury, when not in silver certifi cates, consists of United states notes and treasury notes issued for silver purchases. These forms of money are only useful to the Government in pay- Ing its current ordinary expenses, and its quantity in Government possession does not in the least contribute toward giving us tokens of safe finan cial standing or condition, which is built on gold alone. If it is said that these notes, if held by the Government, can be used to obtain gold, for our re serve, the answer is easy. The people drew gold from the treasury on demand upon United States and treasury notes, but the proposition that the treasury conUi draw gold from the people upon them would be regarded in these days with won der, and if this could be done there Is nothing to prevent those thus parting with their gold from re gaining it the next day or the next hour by the presentation of cotes they received In exchange for it. The Secretary of the Treasury might use such notes taken from a surplus revenue to buy gold In the market. Of course he could not do this with out paying a premium. Private holders of gold, unlike the Government, have no parity to main tain, and would not be restrained from making the best bargain possible when they furnished gold to, the treasury, but the moment the secretary of the Treasury bought gold on any terms above par he would establish a general premium upon it. thus breaking down the parity b?twoen gold ;.nd silver, which the Government is pledged to maintain, and' oreuing the way to new and serious complications. In the meantime the premium would not remain stationary and the absurd spectacle might be ire blot a holder selling gold to the Government and with "United States notes and treasury notes In his hand immediately clamoring lor its return and a resale at a higher premium. It may be Claimed that a large revenue and redundant re ceipts might favorably effect the situation under discussion by affording an opportunity of reclaim i:._' these notes In the treasury when received and thus preventing their presentation for sold. Such retention to be useful ought :o beat least meas urably permanent, and this is precisely what is prohibited, so far as United States notes are con cerned, by the law of 1878, forbidding their fur ther retirement. That statute in so many words provides that these notes, when received into the treasury and belonging to the United States, shall be "paid out again and kept in circulation." It will, morever, readily be seen that the Gov ernment could not refuse to pay our United States notes and treasury notes in current transactions when demanded, and insist on paying out silver ill one and still maintain the parity between that metal and the currency representing gold. Besides the accumulation in the treasury of currency of auy kind exacted from the people through taxa tion is justly regarded as an evil, and it cannot proceed far without vigorous protest against an un justifiable retention of money from the business of the country, and a denunciation of a scheme of taxation which proves itself to be unjust, when it takes from the earnings and income of the citizen money so much in excess of the needs of the Government support that large sums can be gathe red and kept in the treasury- Such a condi • t: n has heretofore in times of surplus revenue led the Government to restore currency to [be peo p.e by the purchase of its nnir.a:ured bonds at a . larce premium and by a large increase of its de posits in National banks, and we easily rememner that the abuse of treasury accumulation has fur- Inrsheda most persuasive argument in favor of legislation radically reducing our tariff. Perhaps It is supposed that sufficient revenue re ceipts would in a sentimental way improve the situation by inspiring confidence in* our solvency and allaying the fear of pecuniary exhaustion, and yet through all our struggles to maintain our gold reserve there never has been any apprehension as to our ready ability to pay our way with such money as we had, and the question whether or not our current receipts met our current expenses h«s rot entered into the estimate of our solvency, of course the general state of our funds exclusive of gold was entirely immaterial to the foreign creditor and investor. His interest could only be paid in gold nd his only concern was our ability to keep on band that kind of money. On July 1. 1893, more than a year and a half be for« the first bonds were issued to replenish the gold reserve, there was a net balance in the treas ury, exclusive of such reserve, of less than $1:-!. ---000,0 JO, but the gold reserve amounted to more than $114,000,000, which was the quieting feature of the situation. It was when the stock of gold be gan rapidly to fall that fright supervened and our securities held abroad were returned for sale and debts owed abroad were pressed lor payment. In the meantime extensive shipments of gold and other unfavorable indications caused restlessness and fright among our people at home. Thereupon the sate of our funds, exclusive of - gold, became also immaterial to them and they, too, drew gold from the treasury for hoarding against all contingencies. This Is plainly shown by the large increase in the proportion of gold withdrawn whicn was retained by our own people as time and threatening incidents progressed. Ijuriusc the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, near ly ?85,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from the treasury and about $77,000,000 was sent abroad, while during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, over 9117,000,000 was drawn out. of which only about £86,000,000 was shipped, leaving the large balance of such withdrawals to be accounted for by domestic hoarding. Inasmuch as the withdrawal of our gold has re sulted largely from fright, there is nothing appar ent that will prevent its continuance or recurrence with its natural consequence except such a change In our financial methods as will reassure the frightened and make the desire for gold less in tense. It is not clear how an Increase in revenue, unless it be in gold, can satisfy those whose only anxiety 13 to gain gold from the Government store. It cannot therefore be safe to rely upon increased revenues M a cure for our present troubles. It is possible that the suggestion of increased revenue as a remedy for the difficulties we are considering may have originated in an intimation of distinct allegation that the bonds which have been issued ostensibly to replenish our gold reserve were really issued to supply insufficient revenue. Nothing ran be further from the truth. Bonds . were issued to obtain gold for the maintenance of our National credit. As has been shown the gold thus obtained has been drawn again from the treasury upon United states notes and treasury 1 notes. This operation would have been promptly prevented if possible, but these notes having thus I wen passed to the treasury, they became the I money of the Government, like any other onli- : nary Government funds, and there was nothing to • do but to use them in paying Government ex penses when needed. At no time when bonds have been Issued have there been any consideration of the question of pay- Ing the expenses of the Government with their proceeds. i here was do necessity to consider that question. At the time of earn bond issue we had a sate surplus in the treasury for ordinary operations, exclusive of the gold in our reserve. in February, 3 894, wheri the firs', issue of bonds was made, such surplus amounted to over 18,000,000; In Novem ber, when the second issue was made, it amounted j to more than $12,000,000: in February, 1895, "hen bonds for the third time were issued such (surplus amounted to more than $100,000,000. It I now amounts to ■ - 072,480 30.. Besides all this, the Secretary of the Treasury j has no authority whatever to issue bonds to In- j crease the ordinary revenues or pay current ex penses. I cannot but think there has been some contusion of ideas regarding the effects of the issue 01 bonds and the result* of the withdrawal of gold. It was the latter process and not the former that by substituting in the treasury United States notes ' and treasury notes for gold Increased at their •mount the money which v. as In the lirst Instance ■abject to ordinary Government expenditures, although the law compelling an Increased pur- ! chase of silver by the Government was passed on , tb- 14th day of July, 1890, withdrawals of gold from the treasury upon the notes given in pay ment on such purchases did not tegin until Octo ber, 1891. Immediately following that date the withdrawal upon both those notes »nd United (States notes increased very largely and have con tinued to such an extent that since the passage of ; that law there has been more than thirteen times :is much gold taken out of the treasury upon United States and treasury notes issued tor silver purchases than was thus withdrawn during the I eleven and a half years immediately prior thereto and after the first day of January, 1 919, when specie payments were resumed. It Is neither unfair nor unjust to charge a larg" share of our present financial perplexities' and dangers to. the operation of the laws of 1878 and lfcOO. compelling the purchase of silver by the Gover&aaeut, which not only furnished a new treasury Oblfgatioa upon which its jrol.l could be withdrawn, but so increase. I t lie 'ear ol an over- ! whelming .flood of sflver and a forced descent to silver payments that even the repeat ot these laws did not entirely cure the evils oi tli.ii existence. ■■> s 

OPPOSES FREE COINAGE. Objections to Mints Being Opened to White Metal. ■ While 1 have endeavored to make a Dlaln state ment of the disordered condition of our currency and the present dangers menacing our prosperity, and to suggest a way which leads to ■ safer finan cial system, I have consistently had in mind the fact that many of my countrymen, whose sincerity \ I do not doubt, insist that the cure for the ills now threatening us may he found in the single and simple remedy of the free coinage of silver. They contend that our mints shall be at once thrown open to the free, unlimited and independent coin age of silver, both gold and silver dollars of full legal tender quality, regardless of the action of any other Government and in full view of the fact that the ratio between the metals which they suggest calls for 100 cents' worth of gold in the gold dol lar a' the present standard and Only 50 cents in intrinsic worth of silver in the silver dollar. Were there Infinitely stronger reasons than can be adduced for hoping that such action would se cure for us a bimetallic currency moving on lines of parity an experiment so novel and hazardous us that proposed might well stagger those who believe that stability is an imperative condition of sound money. .No Government, no human contrivance or act of legislation has ever been able to hold the two metals together in free coinage at a ratio ap preciably different from that which is established in the markets of the world. Those who believe thai our independent free coinage of silver at an artilicial ratio of 16 to 1 would restore the parity between the metals, and consequently between "the coins, oppose an un supported and improbable theory to the general belief and practice of other nations and to the teachings of the wisest statesmen ami economists of the world, both In the past and present, and, what is far more conclusive, they run counter to our own actual experiences. Twice in our earlier history our lawmakers, in attempting to establish a bimetallic currency, undertook free coinage upon a ratio which accidentally varied from the actual relative values of the two metals not more than 3 per cent. In both cases, notwithstanding greater difficulties and cost of transportation than now exist, the coins whose intrinsic worth was undervalued in the ratio gradually and surely dis- ] appeared from our circulation and went toother countries where their real value m better recog- I nized. Acts of Congress were impotent to create ! equality where natural causes ' decreed even aj slight inequality. Twice in our rf cent history we > have signally Jailed to raise by legislation the value of silver. Under an act of congress, passed in 1878, the Government was required for more than twelve years to expend annually $24,000,000 in the purchase of silver bullion for coinage. The act of July 14. 1894, in a still bolder effort Increased the amount of silver the Government was compelled to purchase arid forced II to become the buyer of 54, 000, 000 ounces an Ivor practical ly the entire product of oar miner Under both laws silver rapidly anil steadily declined in value. The prophecy anil the expressed hope and expectation of those in Congress who led In the passage of the last mentioned act that it would re-establish and maintain the former parity between the two metals are still fresh in our memory. In the light of those experiences which accord with the experiences of other nations, there is cer tainly no secure ground for the belief that an act of Congress could now bridge an Inequality of 50 per cent between gold and silver at our present ratio, nor is there the least possibility that our country, which has less than one-seventh of the | silver money in the world, could by its act lon alone raise not only our own, but ail silver to its lost j : ratio with gold. Our attempt to accomplish this by i the free coinage of silver, at a ratio differing widely from actual relative value, would be the signal for ! the complete departure <>:' our gold from circula tion, and immediate and large contraction of our circulating medium and a shrinkage In the real value and monetary efficiency of all other forms of currency as they settled to the level of silver monometallism. 1 Every one who receives a fixed salary ana every worker for was* 8 would find the dollar in his band rntblesi sctled down to a point of bitter disap pointment II no: to pinching privation. A change in our standard to silver monometallism would also . bring on a collapse of the entire system of credit which is based on a standard which is recognized and adopted by the world of business, is many times more po ent and useful than the entire vol ume of currency and is safely capable of almost in definite expansion to meet the grow of trade and enterprise. In a self-invited struggle through darkness and uncertainty our humiliation would be Increased by the consciousness that we had parted company with all the enlightened and progressive nations of the world and were desperately and hopelessly striving to meet the stress Of modern commerce and competition with a debased and unsuitable currency and in association with the few weak and laggard nations which have silver alone as their standard of value. All history warns us against rash experiments which threaten violent changes In our monetary standard and degrada tion of our currency. The past is full of lessons teaching not only the economic danger, but the National Immorality that follows in the train of such experiments. I will not believe that the American people can be i ersua led. after careful deliberation, to jeopardize ■ rKal oo s prestige and proud standing by en couragement of financial nostrums, nor that they will yield to the false allurement of cheap money, when they realize that it must result in the weak ening of that financial integrhy and rectitude which thus far in our history lias been so devotedly cherished as one of the traits of true Americanism. Our country's indebtedness, whether owing by the Government or existing between individuals, has been contracted with reference to our present standard, and to decree by act of Congress that these debts shall be payable in less valuable dol lars than those Within the contemplation and in tention of the parties when contracted would ope rate to transfer by the flat of law and without compensation an amount of property and a vol ume of rights and interests almost incalculable. Those who advocate a blind and headlong plunge into free coinage In the name of bimetallism, professing the belief, contrary to all experience, that we could thus establish a double standard and a concurrent circulation of both metals in our coinage, are certainly reckoning from a cloudy standpoint. Our present standard of value Is the standard of the civilised world and permits the only bimetallism now possible, or at hast that is ' within the independent reach of any single na- I tion, however powerful that nation may be. While I the value of gold as a standard Is steadier by almost universal commercial and business use, it does not despise silver nor seek its banisnment. Wherever this standard Is maintained there is at Its side in free and unquestioned circulation a vol ume of silver currency sometimes equating anil sometimes even exceeding it in amount, both maintained at a parity, notwithstanding a depre- I ciation or fluctuation in the intrinsic value of silver. There is a vast difference between a standard of value and a currency for monetary use. The standard must necessarily be fixed and cer.aln. currency may be in diverse forms and of vari ous kinds. No silver standard country has a gold currency in circulation, but an enlightened and wise system of finance secures the benefits or* both gold and silver as our currency and circulating medium by keeping the standard stable and air other currency at par with it. Such a system and such a standard also give free scope for the use and expansion of safe and conservative credit, so Indispensable to broad and growing commercial transactions, and so well substituted for the actual USe of money. ' if a fixed and stable standard Is maintained, such as the magnitude and safety of our commer- I cial transactions and business require, the use of i money itself is conveniently minimized. Every dollar of fixed and stable value has through the agency • of confident- credit, an astonish ing capacity of multiplying itself in finan cial work. Kvery unstable and fluctuating dollar | falls as a basts of credit, and in Its use begets gam- > bling speculation and undermines the foundations of honest enterprise. I have ventured to express myself on this subject with earnestness and plain ness of speech, because I cannot rid myself of the belief that there lurks in the proposition for the free coinage of silver, so strongly approved and so enthusiastically advocated by a multitude of my countrymen, a serious menace to our pros- 1 perity and an insidious temptation of our people j to wander from the allegiance they owe to public ! and private integrity. It "is because I do not dis- i trust the good faith and sincerity of those who j press this scheme that [ have imperfectly with ' zeal submitted my thoughts upon this momentous subject. 1 cannot refrain from begging them to re examine their views and beliefs in the right, patriotic reason and familiar experience and to weigh again and a;ain the consequences of such legislation as their efforts have Invited. Even the continued agitation of the subject adds greatly to the dliliculties of a dangerous financial situation already forced upon us. In cone usion I especially entreat the people's representatives in Congress who are charged I with the responsibility of inaugurating measures , for the safety and prosper of our common conn- I try to promptly and effectively consider the ills of our critical financial plight. I have suggested a remedy which my judgment approves. 1 desire, however, to assure Congress thai lam prepared to I co operate with it in perfecting any other measure j promising thorough and practical relief, and that I i will gladly labor with them in every patriotic en deavor to farther the Interests and guard the wel fare of our countrymen, whom in our respective places of duty we have undertaken to serve. • (iKoVF.B Clbvkusd.

OPINIONS OF THK MESSAGE. Statesmen Who Think Cleveland Dodged Many Issues. WASHIN'GTOX, I>. C., Dec. 3.— McOreary (Dem.) Ot Kentucky, chairman of the Coinmit iee on Foreign Affairs in the last House, said: "That part on the President's message which :e;er- v> our foreign, relations is very compre hensive and interesting. 11 is recommenda tions are particularly important and appro priate on the (.'uban question, the Venezuelan boundary line disputes, thu Bering Sea claims a:id the Letter preservation of seal life in the North Pacific and flerini?

In the Venezuelan question, the language of THE SAN 

FKANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1895. the rnessfige shows the firmly avowed determ ination of the tnited States "to adhere to the Monroe doctrine in its strictest sense." Gener al Wheeler cannot assent at ail to Mr. Cleve land's financial recommendations. Representative Livingston (Dem.) of Georgia said: "I approve most emphatically what tlie President said on Venezuela. lie has gone as far perhaps in the Cuban matter as interna tional law will permit. Congress can now take the matter up. I do not approve the linancial expressions." Dingley (K.) of Maine said: "The most aston ishing feature of the message was the fact that it entirely omitted to inlorm Congress whether there was or was not a necessity of providing more revenue. The President's reference to the protective policy under which the country prospered so signally from 1801 to 1893 as one 'designed for the protection and benefit of favored classes at the expense of the great mass of our countrymen' and as one 'inefficient for the purpose of revenue,' is a singular disre gard of the fact that during the time in which this policy was enforced revenue was always in excess of peace expenditures and the masses of the people of the country were never before .so prosperous. The effort of the President t*» divert attention from the real causes of the financial stress of the Government by charging the responsibility on the presence of" the green hack in our currency will not prove a success." Walker (R.) of Massachusetts said: "I regret exceedingly that the President felt called upon to repeat the statements that protection is for t in- be tie tit of a favored class and at the ex pense of the great mass of the people; that it is insufficient for revenue; that it impedes our entrance to foreign markets, curtails our foreign trade and that free trade alone can build up our country and develop our in dustries. Tnese propositions are disputed by every acknowledged fact revealed by tne various censuses of this and every other civil ized country, not excepting tlreat Britain." I>alzell (R.) of Pennsylvania said: "So far as the message refers to foreign affairs it may be said to be colorless. That part of it is simply a recital of facts and contains nothing worthy of note. The most remarkable thing nboutjt is the labored attempts to make the people be lieve that the miserable tariff policy oi the present administration istnot responsible for c-ur present ills. With the revenues every month producing a deficit the President's ignoring the fact and indulging in theories ns to financial legislation is suggestive of Nero's fiddling while Rome was burning." Washington (D.) of Tennessee said: "The message is characterized by the usual vigor and clearness with which Mr. Cleveland han dles all questions. The foreign policy indi cated is patriotic, American and in tune with the .Monroe doctrine. His treatmeut of the financial question is clear and convincing." Bell (Pop.) of Colorado said: "Many of the , general recommendations will meet public ap proval. Immigration should be restricted to a very narrow limit and Americanism worked into all of our institutions. His financial rec ommendations, if carried out, would aggra vate our difficulties quite as much as did the repeal of the Sherman act at his request." Johnson (R.) of Indiana said: "The message, so far as it relates to the Cuban, Venezuelan and other foreign questions, is a mere narrative of events. Corceining domestic affairs it is a [ labored effort to fasten the responsibility for j all our business and financial difficulties on the Republican party. In this respect it is a sort of protest against the verdict of the peo ple rendered at the polls. It is gratifying to notice that there is no recommendation for State banks of issue in the message and that the remonetization of silver at the present ra tio is deprecated." Newlands (Silver! te) of Nevada: "Mr. Cleve land, in his message, indulges in the usual fal lacy of gold standard money, -that gold is a fixed ana immutable standard of value. He measures gold by itself, and concludes that it does not change in value. The fact is that gold measured by the prices of other products has constantly increased and is still Increasing in value, as the use of its only competitor, silver, is diminished. The sole cause of the prevail ing depression is the low price of products and property and the high value of gold, which measures them. There Is but one way to cure this fall in prices, and that is to take away a portion of the increased value of gold by re storing silver, its only competitor." Joseph G. Cannon (K.) of Illinois: 'Tnder the constitution the President is commanded to give to Congress information of the state of the Union, but in his message to-day he is flag rantly remiss in this duty as to Ht least one subject of absorbing interest. He omits all] reference in detail to Governmental receipts and expenditure.-, actual as to tiie past fiscal | year and estimated as to the current and next fiscal year. No President, except Mr. Cleve land, "lias in recent years omitted to advise \ Congress in his regular annual message on this > important topic. This omission la at this time the more significant in view of the distressing facts that daring the present administration, since March 4. 18^3, to December 1, 1895, the j expendituresof the Government have exceeded I the receipts by $127,927,254; that the de ficiency in National revenues for the last fiscal year amounted to 803,4-2, and up to L>e- | cember 1, just passed, to $17,600,000; that j during his present administration he has in- I creased our bond indebtedness by $lfi'2,:ils,- j 400; that the estimated expenditures submit ted | in th<j annual book of estimates for 1«!)7 show 1 an increase over the estimates forl^itti of more ! than f 10,500,000, and nearly £2] ,000,000 over j the apprnp nation" made by the last Congress I fur the current year. The message is most tin satisfactory also In its references toour foreign ' relations ami commerce. Our cattle nnd other food products are absolutely excluded from the markets of Germany and adjacent coun tries, while, our home markets are wide open to their products -which comes by the repeal of our late reciprocity provisions and by the enactment of the Wilsou-Brice law. Prom tho tenor of the whole message it is patent that in his judgment r.o legislation increasing the revenues is needed or would receive his aj>- I proval. It is clear, therefore, that there is ] nothing possible through legislation or admin- j lßtration that will cure our ills during his term." Quigg (R.)of New York said: "Mr. Cleve land is a bad doctor. His patient has the con sumption. He has diagnosed for the malaria, and he prescribes merely for a boil on the back of the neck. His remedy would not cure the trouble for which he offers it, and that is not the real trouble at all. What he Bays about the country's finances is answered by the sim ple fact, so justified in everybody's experience, that when n man's income exceeds his expend itures lie is all right, and when his expendi tures exceed his income he is all wrong. This I rule is universal and inexorable. The green backs are a form of public debt. We have had them for many years, and Mr. Cleveland con- I fesses that until he and his party came into j power th"y nevercaused the slightest trouble; but now he proposes to hold them responsible for all the ills which he and his party have gen erated. He starts the furnace, gets "the house too hot to live in, and then, instead of putting out the fire, he swears a*, the thermometer." Bowers (R.) of California said: "The very first paragraph of the message following the introduction sounds the keynote to the whole j message and is a specimen of adamantine, cheek. He says, "It is pleasing to note that j efforts to enlarge exchange of trade are appre ciated by the Argeutine Republic, which recog nized the value of a large market opened to free importation of its wools under our tariff ' act and lias admitted certain ot our products' at reduced duties.' He is Careful not I to state what products or at what reduc tions. He did not care. He could show no reciprocal beuefit to the United States, i Pleased he is at the destruction of one of the greatest industries of this country | and the distress it has brought upon its people, I ami is pleased that foreign nations have bene fited thereby. The contemptible foreign policy, which has made every true American ashamed, is well illustrated in the message where it refers to Hawaii and the Waller case, i It 'insisted' in the case of little Hawaii, but I 'requested' of great France— sends Hawaiian Minister home, but is delighted that France proposed some time to arbitrate. Two years at?o lie was convinced that the Sherman law I was the cause of all our trouble. Its repeal ! proved him a false prophet. Now he is con- ; vinced that the only practical remedy for our ! troubles will be found in the retirement of greenbacks and the issue of more bonds." Senator Perkins said: "It reads beautifnllv. The style is fine, but like confectionery, it | tickles the palate, but doeis not satisfy hunger I for something more substantial. His'financial discussion docs not offer consolation to any one but to bo nkers, who are promised another bond issue. He offers congratulation to his country- I men that the Argentine Republic is prosper ing because its wool is allowed to compete with ! the products of our own farmers, and this ! opening paragraph of his message will doubt less be" read with interest by our California sheep-raisers. Senator White thinks the message an able document in its general aspect, and at thesame time confesses that he has not read it very carefully, and therefore cannot say whether he is willing to adopt Mr. Cleveland's views on all things considered in it. Representative Barham said: "It read to me like the vaporing* of a very tired man, It lacked 'ginger'— hart no' snap to it. He said not a word about subjects in which we are all deeply and vitally interested. His suggestion of another bond issue is simply disgusting and nauseating. His treatment of the subject of our foreign relations was tame indeed." Hllborn said : "The President seems to think that greenbacks are responsible for our trouble in keeping the gold reserve intact, but we have had greenbacks for many years and have only had Grover for a few years, and we had no 'difficulty with our gold reserve until he made the trouble himself." Representative MHguire said: "I have not read the message in Its entirety, but glanced through that part devoted to finances. I think his reasoning is illogical. He points noway out of the difficulty.'^ Representative McLachlan said: "President Cleveland has failed to prescribe any remedy for our deplorable n'nancial ills. In spite of the disastrous results of the Wilson bill he still favors free trade. He only voices the senti ment of his party, however, and the only relief we can expect must come from Republicans." Grove Johnson says: "The message was tire some. The President faiied to discuss Ha waiian annexation, tiie Xiearaguan canal pro j ject and many other questions- of living inter est to our people. His treatment of the sub ject of foreign relations was simply a rehash of ola news. His recommendation to retire green backs will be antagonized not only by the Re publican party, but by many Democrats. Did you notice that when the clerk finished read ing the message in the House to-day that only four or live Representatives in the hall ap plauded him? It was the coldest frost 1 ever saw. Even his own party were disgusted with him." Ex-Speaker Crisp's comments were: "I heard with some surprise and great regret that part ot the message relating to our finances. That relief is needed no one doubts. That it can be found in the direction indicated in the mes sage I don't believe. The President makes as strong an argument as can be made in favor of the single gold standard, but 1 dun't think he fairly states the case. He assumes throughout his message that obligations are payable in gold. There is no law on the statute books justifying this assumption. All bonds, treasury notes ami other obligations of the United States are payable in coin— that is, gold ( and silver of the present standard of weight and fineness— and if the treasury would excr } cisc the option which, the law and contracts give of paying in those metals most convenient to it our diliictilties would be less. I am op posed to the retirement of the greenbacks and shermiin notes, because it would ruinously contract our currency. Neither can 1 approve the propositions recommended to enlarge the privileges of the National banks. 1 have no doubt the President honestly believes he is right, and I know I as honestly believe he is wrong." Hopkins (R.) of Illinois, a member of the last Committee on Ways and Means, said: "The message ignores the true cause of the un numbered woes that have been brought upon tho people of the country, and that is the re- I peal (if a tariff which gave enough revenue to ' pay all the running expenses of the (iovcrn- I meat and left a surplus in the treasury, and in lieu of that placed upon the statute-books of the country the (iorman-Wilson bill that has j never given revenue sufficient to meet the run ning expenras.oi the Government." Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio said: "The message, no far as it deals in details of our foreign rela tions, is very interesting and instructive. But when he refers to the great benefits our new i tariff act has given to the sheepmen of the I Argentine country he seems to be rejoicing i over the ruin of more than a million sheep | raised in our country, and he forgets that side by side with cheaper wool comes the product ot foreign looms striking deadly blows at the labor of a host of American workers." Patterson (D.) oi Tennessee said: "The mes sage is an exceedingly able state paper. It is statesmanlike and courageous throughout. Ills party for a time has gone down in defeat, but Sir. Cleveland remains in the unshaken confidence of the American people." Aldrich (R.) of Rhode Island said: "In the face of a rapidly growing deficit the message suggests no riicUi*"! for providing an increase in revenue. The President's recommendation for the retirement of the greenbacks will avail nothing, because the members of his party in the Senate and v large majority of the Senate ! are committed to a policy directly antagonistic j to Mr. Cleveland's views. A bill to retire ' these notes could not be reported from the Finance Committee as at present constituted, nor from any committee, as I believe, that will be formed in the Senate. The portion of the i message to be commended is the reference to Venezuelan matters." Hansbrough (R.) of North Dakota said: "It exhibits a complete abandonment of the mes sage of ;887, and opens the way to further j gold-bond issues as a means of defraying the expenses of the Government." Smith (D.) of New Jersey said: "I was very much gratified at the financial recommenda ! tions contained in the document." Palmer (D.) of Illinois said: "I indorse the Idea of retiring tho greenbacks as a general : proposition, but I nave not investigated the full scheme as unfolded in the message.' Cockrell 'Dem.) of Missouri said: "lam op posed to the retirement of the greenbacks and transferring to the National banks the sole power of controlling the currency of this country.'

DOCTOR SWEANY 737 Market. Street, San Francisco, Cal. Opposite Kxamlner Office. t IT HAS BEEN SAID OVER AND OVER ; again that the poet "is born— not made," | cr, as the Latin is, "Poeta nascitur, non fit," but really the rule applies to nearly all of the arts ana sciences, if not to the world at large. One of the most conspicuous instances that we know Of is that of the eminent specialist, Dr. \ I Sweany. It is safe to affirm that there are few people indeed on this slope who have not j I heard of this noted savant, whose whole life | has been spent in the holy cause of '-health j for the masses." With Dr. Sweany it is not a | , labor to do good— it is simply ana purely an errand of mercy. He feels that he has been ! particularly blest in having had opportunities which it is the fortune of but few medical men j to enjoy, but at the same time it must be re- j membered that he has fully profited by them j all. To enumerate the various schools of mcdi- j cine and surgery In which he has been a well- j known student, assistant or professor would be ' too much like a medical directory of the United j States and Europe, for, truth to tell, Dr. Sweany has sought knowledge wherever it could be found, and graven on the records of many an j eminent European hospital is the name of j F. L. Sweany, M.P., as consulting physician ! and sureeoVi. But of late years Dr. Sweany has ; been giving to the people of this slope the j benefit of all his research, and to that fact many a man can trace his perfect health. Dr. Sweany's practice here has brought to the weak strength; to the chronic sufferer relief ; to diseased women and children health; to erring men and youths hope; and to all who i have honestly sought his advice and followed' ! It a perfect cure. And the people as a whole have stood up and praised him. Thousands upon thousands have willingly testified— not only by letter but. orally— to his ability and matchless skill, and day by day he adds fresh laurels to a brow already crowned with the victor's wreath. His patients come from all grades of society. 1 In his reception-rooms the merchant prince sits side by side with the me- chanic, and that honest fellow often "touches elbows" with a day laborer. - None are too high and none too lowly to receive the attention of I this clever man, and no matter what the dis- j ease may be, to each ami nil he brings the skill and learn ing of a life's work spent in study.. To the poor Dr. Sweany extends a helping hand in a noble way, for on Friday afternoons they are treated free at I his offices. Of course it would be manifestly impossible to treat all the poor who might apply by letter, for the doctor has patients |in almost every State in the Union, and indeed some in foreign countries, but the resident population has had to thank him for many a noble act— many a generous deed. Dr. Sweany is not only a wonderfully clever man; he is a deservedly respected one, too. On that the whole slope is agreed. , : seeing to be incomplete and is lacking in sug gestions pertinent at, this time. With our rev enues woefully short of the requirements there is not one word cbout increasing those revenues." Voorhees (Dem.) of Indiana, chairman of the Committee on Finance, said: "The message is repugnant to everything that I have held to on the financial subject through life, and for one I will not vote to repeal the greenbacks." Brice (D.) of Ohio said : "Mr. Cleveland's only* object was perhaps to agitate the subject of the retirement of the «reenbacks in this I chamber." Gray (D.) of Delaware said : "I have not been able to read the message yet and I heard it but imperfectly, but such parts as 1 did hear strike me as being strong, forceful and persuasive. ; His suggestions that we should retire the : greenbacks is a good one, and I heartily in- I dorse it. The message as a whole makes a great document, and I am sure it will be ap proved by the mass of the people." Tillman (Pop.) of South Carolina said: "I see nothing in the* message that indicates statesmanship or a regard for the general wel fare of the people. The question that suggests itself to my mind is. If he retires the green backs what will be substituted therefor as cur rency? If National bank notes are to be issued upon the bonds issued to retire the green backs, why not save the interest that will ac crue upon these bonds? The policy of Mr. Cleveland is surely leading to plutocracy in stead of democracy." Vilas (Dem.) of Wisconsin said: "I will cheerfully support him in his endeavor to have the greenbacks retired. The message is a sound and patriotic document and deserves the favorable consideration of the whole peo ple." Peffor (Pop.) of Kansas said: "The message makes it plain that the cause of the money changers vs. the people must be tried by a jury of the people." Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska said: "What other message than this could have been expected from G rover Cleveland?" Teller (R.) of Colorado said: "Mr. Cleveland assumes a supercilious tone in speaking ol the i tariff and silver question and the conditions that existed heretofore. We had the purchase ! of silver bullion established for several years I and we had the McKinley tariff act, and >et the country never enjoyed a better season of piosperity "than under "these two measures. The President says the tariff has destroyed our exports, and yet we never had such ex ports as we enjoyed under the McKinley tariff; they were infinitely larger than under the present Democratic measure. The present law is not, of course, alone: Democratic lines, but it j was the best they could get. It was so Dad in I Mr. Cleveland's eyes that he could not sign it; I it wus unsatisfactory to him because it did not i approach more nearly to free trade. The mes ! sage was quite ordinary and made no impres ; sion upon the Senate." 

COMMENT OF THE PRESS. Some Democratic Journals Join in the Qeneral Disgust. KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 3.— Speaking of the President's message the Journal (K.) will say to-morrow: In a patronizing 1 , now-my-chil dren sort of way the President of the United States presumes, through a superabundance of words and specious phrases, to instruct Con gress as to its duty. He is mildly compassion ate with the misguided millions who don't believe as he believes, and has no hesitancy In saying that it they will just listen to him they will all change their minds. He entirely ig- DjO res questions of greatest moment in the in ternal affairs of the Nation, not deigning to give even one small word to matters that are occupying the minds of millions of our citi zens, and delivers a stump oration that is tire some in its verbosity and insulting iv its pat ronizing style. The Time's (O.) will say: "When President Cleveland wrote his famous tariff-reform mes sage to Congress, in 1887. it sounded as clear ah a bugle note all over the civilized world, and, although at nrst voted down by the people, two years later, linon reflection, his brave words were accepted as truths, and two years later still were enacted as law by an overwhelming majority of tho American people. So it must and 'surely will be with re gard to the President'! message of yesterday. Discarding all surplusage, Mr. Cleveland ad dresses himself to two great questions — the money issue and our foreign relations. In the matter of rinauee the President rapidly re views the condition of all'tiirs, and bravely as sumes the responsibility for the gold-standard policy to which his administration has com mitted the Nation. The message is a model of pure and vigorous English, without, however, the slightest attempt at the giaces of the rhetorician. 

OMAHA, Nebk., Dec. 3.— The World-Herald DOCTOR SWEANY-NEW TO-DAY. <v *tRS FAI L Cq OOGTORSWEANY WE ARE ALL SO HIGHLY STRUNG UP that it is not surprising to find prevalent among us nervous debility. It is often sup- posed that this terrible disease — for that is what it is in its effects— is invariably the result of indiscretions in youth and early manhood, but that is by no means so. It is true that these things are responsible for most of it, but there are other things which contribute their share. Anxiety and secret worry bring on a state which is as bad as any of those horrible conditions which come from early follies. You cannot sleep, you fume and fret over trifles, your back is weak and you are utterly unfit to do your regular day's work. Do you know what that ifll means? It means life to you! Nothing less! That is a hard statement for you- to believe? Don't be foolish.. More harm will come to you if you neglect these symptoms; and they are not all by a long way. To-day, for a change, look at yourself in tlie glass." Are your lips pale? Are your .. eyes slightly yellow where vhey should be white? Are they a little bit bloodshot? Have you got what the people who try to be funny in a theater call "the blues,' r or is your memory failing? If you are suffering from any of these things just try and remember what early fol- lies you may have been guilty of, and if you are certain that you are innocent of all you may make up your mind that you have been straining your nervous system in. some other way. Perhaps in woirying over crops; per- haps about a little matter of affection, and pos- sibly about some speculation. But no matter what the cause, the result is bound to be as bad in each . case. And the longer you let matters run the worse they are going to be. Do you know that? Do you know that half the eviis that humanity is heir to are directly due to that stupid practice of putting off till to-morrow what you could and should do to- day? If you don't know this you should learn it, ana learn it thoroughly, for the penalty of not seeking 70/-;/V '/■'•'• r - '*!•"' PROPER HELP In due season is far more serious than you may think. Thousands upon thousands of people have come toDr.Sweany who hud no idea as to where they were drifting until the great specialist told them, and it is well known that he has saved many a man from the horror of a suicide's grave by his help and advice. "A pound of prevention is worth a ton of cure" may be a very old saying, but is none the less true, and if you see < the slightest touch of any of these symptoms be warned in time and. seek advice where you know that you will get it, and get what is worth untold gold— HEALTH. WATCH THESE. Some people pay no attention to the small ills of life, but that is as stupid as to neglect the greater ills. Catarrh, for instance. That an- noying disease often leads to severe nervous derangement. .In its < treatment Dr. Sweany has been uniformly successful, and if you have a dry, hacking cough; if you hawk and spit in the morning; if you find a difficulty in breathing; if your hearing is affected at all; if you have a dull pain in your head, or a nervous -headache you should seek relief at once. There is infinite danger in delay. Don't risk it. _____ • - - '■-'■■ ■ F. L. SWEANY, M.D. 737 Market Street, S. F. OPPOSITE EXAM l (D.) commenting on the President's message ; to-morrow will say: The President and his followers never intimated the necessity of the ; retirement of greenbacks when they secured , the unconditional repeal of the Sherman law, ! and they don't now suggest the retirement of j silver when they urge the retirement of legal I tender notes, but it is all a part of the same policy. It is the Wall-street idea and it is so j hideous that even the President has not the I courage to disclose it all at onto. The Presi. \ dent's mad effort to hasten the universal i gold standard will really aid the cause ! of bimetallism by attracting public at- ! tention to the only reasonable rem- i edy— the immediate restoration of the ' goid and silver coinage of the constitution. In the proposition to retire the greenbacks Mr. Cleveland will not have the aid of the Repub- i lican leaders as he had in the repeal of the purchasing clause of the Sherman law. The ! Republican leaders will be too shrewd to de- ! stroy themselves as Mr. Cleveland has destroyed himself. The Bee (R.) will say: This third annual message of President Cleveland will not rank among great state papers. It is not, In- i deed, up to nis own best standard, and it will ] exert little iniiuence upon public opinion. It I conveys the impression of the perfunctory work of a man who did not like the task, not because there is lack of quantity, but for the reason that the quality is not of a very high order. Certainly those friends of Mr. Cleve land who think he ought to be nominated next | year as the only aA - ailable Democrat in the country will find little in the message to in- i spire their interest or enthusiasm in his be- i half. 

CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 3.— The Chicago news papers to-morrow will comment on the Presi- | dent's message as follows: Times-Herald (Ind.): In its broad and com- I prehensive grasp of the questions dealt with the message is one of the strongest state papers | that Mr. Cleveland has ever written. In re- ; speet to the Venezuelan question the President ; shows the vigor of the administration's foreign policy. Only those who hoped that the Presi- | dent Would not rise to the "height of this great : argument" and sustain in all its broadness ! the modern construction of the Monroe doc- i trine will be disappointed in his utterances. , The country at large will receive them with j acclaim. Inter Ocean (Rep.): The remarkable thing ! about the first half of the message is its tame- ' ness and utter lack of sympathy with little Venezuela in its controversy with the big bully, John Bull, or with Cuba in its efforts to throw off the yoke of despotism. The Monroe ' doctrine is stated in a very mild and halting way, and when it comes to poor Cuba, not the ; slightest touch of the chord of sympathy comes j from him. There is nothing new in the finan- ; cial part of the message, nor is there the re motest chance that any bill will pass Congress ! either against greenbacks or for free silver. The President merely cudgels the air mima- ; terially. The Record (Ind.): The financial clauses of ; the message will repay reading as furnishing I one of the best and most succinct expositions of the subject yet published. They have weight with the President as well as with the legislators and for this reason it is not likely | that Congress will be compelled to consider the President's counsels. The Tribune (R.): The President in his mes sage recognizes that the sympathies of the American people are with the Cuban insur gents. They have nobly earned recognition as men carrying on war, but the President is | silent. Now let Congress speak. The Presi- I dent is clear in general terms on the point ! that it is the duty of the Nation and of the ad ministration to uphold the various kinds of currency to a parity with gold, but is not sufficiently explicit in reference to the flood of little-more-than-half-worth silver money that has been omitted at the demand of cheap money men. ST. 

LQUIS, Mo., Dec. 3.— The Republic (D.) will say: The most satisfactory passage in the document is that touching upon the Venezuela affair. The financial plans set forth are re- i pugnant To many Democrats. As a whole the i message is a model exposition of the topics j treated. The Globe-Democrat (R.): There is a con spicuous absence of "jingo" in the President's treatment ol foreign concerns and nothing i brilliant or vigorous. The financial part of the ■ message is full of spirit and deserves careful j reading. The President's plan for getting rid of greenbacks and Sherman notes is simple and j wise. NEW 

YORK, X. V., Dec. 3.— The leading New I York papers comment on the President's mes- j sage as follows: The Tribune: President Cleveland's message ! is unique as a revelation of character. No j President has ever delivered another message affronting so large a share of the people. Its treatment of foreign questions will affrontvery j many of his own party; its treatment of | the "silver question will" offend more than j two-thirds of that party: its pretense that the present whisky and sugar tariff which he denounced as "perfidy and dishonor," is in principle based on denial of the right of governments to protect industries wil) offend every sincere advocate of that cause; and its demand for the substitution of bonds for «**"JT*! 4 coe o 

DOCTOR SWEANY THE CLIMATE OF CALIFORNIA IS PAR- ticulany prolific in producing that most an- noying of all diseases, nasal catarrh, and pat- ent remedies by the score— aye, by the hun- dreds, and even by the thousand — have been introduced for its cure. Butcompetent special- ists like Dr. Sweany know that the disease is not local— it is constitutional. If you think that you are in the slightest way afflicted with it you should at once apply for relief. It is like a snowdrift— it begins nlmost invisibly, but when it has once got a good hold there is going to be quite a good deal oi bother in get- ting rid of it. A hard cough is one of the first signs, and then comes constipatiou, a bad taste in the mouth in the morning, a desire to expectorate every few moments, and a breath to which that of the coyote even is preferable. There is no disease which is more harmful in its various ways. People get to dislike to be in your company and avoid you as they do their creditors, and, worse than all, it is the certain forerunner of some of the most fatal ailments that are known to medical science. The mucus drops into the stomach ana destroys the lining of that organ and impairs first and then entirely destroys digestion. Then the lungs get affected and consumption often fol- lows, and as a fruitful source of the entire breaking down of the nervous system it has no equal. T>r. Pweany takes each case and treats it constitutionally. What suits one case does not of necessity cure another, and it is in this way that he lias Deen able to trace to its original cause— namely, catarrh— many of the difficult and dangerous cases which his ability and skill have conquered and cured. The same advice may be given here as in the nervous troubles -you cannot apply for help too soon, but don't iorget that it is quite easy to be too late. If you trine with nature too long she will resent it. TO WOMEN. Dr. Sweanv's help and assistance has at all times proved to be of the utmost value. No matter whether they were in the very bud of young womanhood, "whether they were blush- ing tli e i r first roues as happy or unhappy mothers, whether they were in" the prime of matronly womanhood, or whether they were nearing'the change of life—in each and every instance this eminent specialist's advice has been oJ untold value. Painful menstruation, leucorrhcra, displacement of the womb, and all 'the distressing ailments peculiar to the weaker sex, have been made a special study of by Dr. Sweany, and in each and every case he takes peculiar interest. And he is especially suc- cessful in these, and indeed all diseases of womeu. WATCH THESE. Are you ashamed to confess if you are a young man that you have a disease of a private nature? Have you tried some patent remedy for it and failed to effect a cure? Are you neglecting and endangering your health by hoping that time alone will effect a cure? It so stop and consider for a moment. In Dr. Sweany you have a friend in whom you may confide with the utmost safety. Your little troubles will be kept as sacredly confidential as though they were the country's secrets, and you can get a speedy and a sure cure. But don' waste time. F. L. SWEANY, M. D. 737 Market Street, S. F. INER OFFICE. greenbacks will affront mnnv Democrats; while in scarcely any respect will the message satisfy the great majority who elected more than two-thirds of the present House of Rep resentatives. The Times: The President recognizes tnat the ultimate causes of our difficulties are re mote—that they spring from a mistaken policy for which each party ~is more or less respon sible, and that this system has so long been in existence, has so far affected the opinions and habits of the great body of the people, that its reform requires the hearty co-operation of the clear-headed and right-minded men in public life, without regard to party. The Sun: There are two passages in Mr. Cleveland's message which deserve unquali fied consideration. The first is his announce ment that England has been notified regarding her dispute with Venezuela that the present administration adheres to the Monroe doc trine; that the traditional policy of the United States is firmly opposed to any forcible in crease of the territorial possessions of any Eu ropean power on this continent, and that the policy embodied in the Monroe doctrine is right and sound and will be maintained. 

SCORED BY THE ENGLISH. Cleveland's Message Does Not Even Please London Papers. LONDON, Eng., Dec. 3.— The Daily News, commenting on President Cleveland's message to Congress, will to-morrow say: "A worse financial muddle than Mr. Cleveland stated would bediflicult to conceive, if such is the result of tampering with the currency for the supposed relief of powerful interests. It is worth the attention of our currency doctors." The News will refer to the Venezuela dispute as h matter in which the United State.s is not directly concerned. The principle of arbitra tion is invaluable, but its friends should be ware of straining it unduly. The comparative weakness oi Venezuela does not give tnat country exceptional rights. Arbitration has nothing to do with the relative strength of the parties. The President's message is silent re garding the outrage on the British Guiana policy. It is neither dignified nor politic for Washington to take op the ijiiarrels for South American com m unities which do not observe the usages of civilized nations. The Tinted States will find out some day that this sort of patronage involves corresponding responsi bility, and will not like it at all. With regard to the President's reference to Armenia the paper will say: It should be thought thnt when American missionaries are robbed and evicted with the connivance and complicity of the Sultan an American warship would be a better asent than the powers, who ore all protocols and no policy. The lives of Americans in Asia Minor cannot bo considered safe. It would go hnrd with Mr. Cleveland if be allowed them to perish. The Standard will say: The maintenance of friendly relations between (ireat Britain and the United States is of such supreme import ance that we cannot but regret the tone in which President Cleveland .-muded to the dis pute .with Venezuela. If we may judge the tone and substance of the dispatch addressed to Embassador Bayard in July from the para phrase communicated to Congress, we are not in the least surprised that no answer has yet been received. We undertake to predict that when the answer reaches the White House it will furnish the President with much matter for serious reflection. We have far too much confidence in the strength and generosity of American character to believe for a moment that the President will be sustained in his position by the better order of transatlantic sentiment. Referring to the Bering Sea paragraph of the message the Standard will say: Mr. Cleve land has still to urge upon a refractory Con gress decer.cy and justice in complying with this plain condition of an honest award. Upon the matter of currency reform the President writes lucidly and emphatically, as usual, but we are not much impressed by "the remedy he proposes. Tne Mornine Post will say: Regarding Samoa and Venezuela the message appears to do framed on lines that Senator Chandler might approve. The President appears to assume that f)nsrland must be wrong because she is stronger than Venezuela. The Chronicle will say: The President's reference to Armenia is practically an invita tion to the powers to coerce the Sultan, and being backed up by the sending of a cruiser, it must be regarded as a definite adherence of the United States to the European concert. Few honest critics can say anything against the references to Venezuela. We agree with the President that the matter is eminently suited for impartial arbitration. The Times will say: The failure of Congress to embody Mr. Cleveland's proposed financial measures in legislation will undoubtedly give a severe sheet to business interests. We shall be greatly surprised it the plan is not welcomed in the great commercial centers of the United States, if Mr. Cleveland is right, as he is re garded as being by dispassionate observers here. fai l Oq
