A STATE PAPER. The Last Annual Message of Presi­ dent Arthur to the Congress of the Nation. A Document Replete With Sound Sense and Wholesome Recom­ mendations. The Country Congratulated Upon Its Prosperity and Standing Among Nations. The Discontinuance of Silver Coinage and the Issuance of Sliver Certificates Advised. The President's Message. To THE 

CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES: Since the close of your last session the American people in exercise of their highest right of snffrage, have choacn their chief ms gist rate for the four years ensning. When it is remembered that at no period in the country's history has the long political contest which customarily precedes the day of the national election been waged with greater fervor and intensity, it is a subject of congratulation that after the con. troversy at the polls was over, and while the slight preponderance by which the issue had been determined was as yet unascertained, but the people everywhere patiently and quietly awaited the result. Nothing could more strik­ ingly illustrate the temper of the American citizan his love of order and bis loyalty to law. Nothing could more clearly demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our political institu­ tions. Eight years have passed since a contro­ versy concerning the result of a national election sharply called the attention of congress to the necessity of providing more precise and definite regulations for counting the electoral vote. It is of the greatest importance that this question be solved before corflicting claims to the presidency shall again distract the countiy and I am persuaded that by the people at large any of the measures of relief thus far proposed would be preferred to continued inaction. 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. Our relations with all foreign powers continne to be amicible. With Belgium a treaty has been signed whereby the scope of presenf treaties has been so enlarged as to secure to citizens of either country within the jurisdic­ tion of the other equal rights and privileges in the acquisition and alienation of property. A trade mark treaty has also been concluded. The war between Chili and Pern is at an end, and for the arbitration of the claims of American citizens, who, dnring its continuance, suffered through the acts of the Chilian authorities, a convention will soon be negotiated. The state of hostilities between France and China con­ tinues to be an embarrassing feature of our eastern relations. The Chinese government has promptly adjusted and paid the claims of American citizens whose property was destroyed in the recent riots at Canton, and I renew the recommendation of my last annual message, that the Canton indemnity fund be returned to China. The true interpretation of tin recent treaty with that country permitting restriction of Chinese immigration is likely to be again a subject of your deliberation, and it may be seriously questioned whether the statute passed at the last session does not violate the treaty rights of certain Chinese who left this country with return certificates valid under the old law and who now seem to be debarred from landing from the lack of certificates required by the new. CTJR COMMERCE. The rec nt rurchases by the United States of a large trading fleet, heretofore under the Chi­ nese fl g, has considerably enhanced our com­ mercial importance in the east and in view of the large number of vessels built or purchased by American citizens in other countries and exclusively employed in legitimate traffic between foreign ports, under the recognized protection of out flvg, it might be well to pro­ vide a uniform rate for their registration and documentation si that the bona fide property rights of our citizens therein shall be duly evidenced and property guarded. Pursuant to the advice of the senate at the last session we recognized tf-e fi*g of the international associa­ tion of the Congo as that of a friendly govern­ ment avoiding in BO doing any prejudgment of a conflict in territorial claims in thut region and subsequently, in execution of the expressed wish of congress, aprointed a commercial agent for the Congo basin. The importance of the rich productive trade of the Congo valley has led to a general conviction that it should be opened to all nations upon rqual terms and an international conference for the consideration of this subject was called by the emperor of Germany and is now in session at Berlin. Dele­ gates are in attendance on behalf of the United States and of the results of the conference you will be duly advised. Ihe government of Corea has generously aided tn efforts of the United States minister to secure salable premises for the use of the legation, and as the conditions of diplomatic intercourse with eastern nations demand that the legation premise* be owned by the represented power I advise that an appro­ priation be made for the acquisition of this property by tha government. The United States already possf sies valuable premiiBes at Tangiers as a gift from the sultan of Morocco and as is stated hereafter they have lately received a similar pift from the Siamese government and the government of Japan slands ready t- pre­ sent to us extensive grounds at Tokio whereon to erect a suitable building for the legation, court house and jail, and similar privileges can probably be secured in China and Persia. The owning of such premises would not only effect a large saving of the present rentals, but would permit of the due assertion of extra territorial rights in these countries and would the better serve to maintain the dignity of the United States. 

RELATIONS WITH EGYPT. The'failu-e of congress to make appropria­ tion for onr representation at the court of the Khedive has proved a serious embarrassment in our intercourse with Egypt, and in view of the necessary intimacy of diplomatic relationship due to the participation of this government as one of the treaty powers on all matters of ad­ ministration there affecting the rights of for­ eigners, hitherto held with respect to the Khedive, or that citizens of this repnblio raiding or so­ journing in Egypt should hereafter be without the aid and protection of a competent repre­ sentative. With France the traditional cordial rela:ionBhip continues. The Bartholdi statue of Liberty Enlightening the World, the gen­ erous gift of the people of France, iB. expected to reach New York in Hay next, and I suggest that congressional action be taken in relation to the spirit which has prompted this gift and in aid of the timely completion of the pedestal on which it is to be placed. Our relations with Germany, a country which contributes to ours some of the best elements of cit­ izenship, continne to be cordial. The United States have extradition treaties with several of the German states but, by reason of the confederation of these states under the impsrial rule, the application of such treaties is not as uniform and comprehensive as the inter­ ests of the two countries require, I propose therefore to open negotiations for a convention of extradition, to embrace all the territory of the empire. It affords me pleasure te say that our intercourse with Great Brition continues to be of a nlost friendly character. The govern­ ment of Hawaii has indicated its willingness to continue for seven years the provisions of the existing reciprocity treaty and such contenance, in view of the relations of that country to the American system of states, Bhonld in my jaug­ ment be favored INTERNATIONAL EXHIB TIONS. This government is in frequent rece'pt of invitations from foreign states to participate in international exhibitions, often of great interest and importance. Oc^upjing, as we do, an advanced position on the world's production and aiming to secure a profitable share for enr industries in the general competitive markets, it is a matter of serious concern that the want of means for participation in these exhibits should BO often exclude our producers from advantages engaged by those of other countries During the past year the attention of congress was drawn to the formal invitations in this regard tendered by the governments of England. Holland, Belgium, Germany and Ana tria. The executive has in some instances appointed honorary commissioners this is,however,a most unsatisfactory expedient, for without some provision to meet the neces­ sary working expenses of a commission it can effect little or nothing in behalf of exhibitors An international inventors' exhibition is to be held in London next May. This will cover a field of special importance in which oar country holds foremost rank, bnt the executive is at present powerless to organizs a proper repre­ sentation of our vast national interests in this direction. I have in several previous messages referred to this subject and it seems to me that a statute giving to the executive general discre­ tionary authority to accept sncb invitations and to appoint honorary commissioners without sal­ ary, and placing at the disposal of the secretary of state a small fund fur defraying their reason­ able expenses would be of great public utility. 

DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. The legislation of the last session effected in the diplomatic and consular service contain changes and reductions which have been pro ductive of embarrassment. The population and commercial activity of onr country are steadily on the increase and are giving rise to new, varying and often delicate relationships with other countries. Our for­ eign establishment now embraces nearly double the area of operations that it did twenty yeers ago and the confinement of such a service within the limits of expenditure then estab­ lished is not, it EeemB to me, in accordance with true ecouomy, and a community of 60,000,000 of people should be adequately rep.esented in its intercourse with foreign nations. A pro­ ject for the reorganization of the consular service and forecasting the scheme of extra territorial jurisdiction is now before you 'f the limits of a short session will not allow its full consideration, I trust you will not f-iil to make suitable provisions for the needs of the service. It has been customary to defice in the appropriation acts the ranks of each diplo matic office to which a salary is attached I suggest that this course be abandoned and that it be left to the president with the advice and consent of the senate, to fix from time to time the diplomatic grade of the representatives of his government abroad, as may seem ad­ visable provisions being dpfinitely made, how­ ever, as now, for the amount of salary at tached to the respective stations. THE 

TREASURY DEPARTMENT. The condition of our fioanceB and the opera­ tions of the various branches of the public service which are connected with the treasury department are very fully diecussed in the repoit of the secretary. It appears that the ordinary revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30,1884, were from customs $195,007 489.76 from internal renenue $121,586,972.51 from all other sources $31,866,307.65 total ordinary revenues $348,519,869.92. I concur with the secretary of the treasury in recommending the immediate suspension of the coinage of silver dollars and of the issuance of Bilver certificates, and this is a matter to which in former com­ munications I have more than once invoked the attention of the national legislature. It appears that annually, for the past six years, there have been coined, in compliance with the require ments of the act of February 28,1878, more than twenty-seven million silver dollars and thennmber outstanding is reported by the sec­ retary to be nearly one hundred and eighty-five millions, whereof but little more than forty millions, or less than 22 per cent, are in actual circulation. The mere existence of this fact seems to me to furnish of itself a cogent argu­ ment for 1 he repeal of the statute which has made such a fact possible, but there a: other and graver n*iderations that tend in the same direction. The secretary avows his convic­ tion that unless the coinage and the issuance of silver certificates be suspended, silver is likely, at no distant day, to become our sole metallic standard. The commercial distur­ bance and the impairment of national credit that would be thus occassioned can scarcely be over estimated. I hope that the secretary's suggestion, respecting the withdrawal from circulation of the $1 and $2 notes will re­ ceive your approval, as it is likely that a con­ siderable portion of the silver now incum­ bering the vaults in the treasury might thus find ite way into the currency. While trade dollars I advise the restoration of the agency and consul general at Cairo on its former basis, as I do not conceive it to be the wish of congress that the United States should withdraw alto­ gether from the honorable position they hava have ceased, for the present at least, to b.i an element of active disturbance in our currency system, some provision should be made for their surrender to the government. In view of the circumstances under which they were coined and of the fsct that they have neiver had a legal quality, there should be offered for them only a slight. advance of their bullion value The secretary, in the course of his report, considers the propriety of beauti­ fying th9 designs of oar subsidiary silver coins and so increasing their weight that they may bear* due ratio of value of the standard dollar, and his conclusions in this regard are cordially approved. In my annual message of 1882,1 recommended the abolition of all excise taxes except those relating to distilled spirits This recommendation is now renewed. In case these taxes shall le abolished the revenues that will still remain to the government, in my opinion, will not only suffice to meet its reasonable expendi­ tures, but will afford a surplus large enough to permit such tariff reduction as may seem to be advisable when the results of recent revenue laws and commercial treaties shall have shown in what quarters these reductions can be most judiciously effected. One of the gravest of the problems which appeal to the wisdom of oongress for solution is the ascertainment of the most effective means of increasing our foreign trade and thus relieving the depression u: which our industries are now languishing. THE 

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. Of the varied governmental concerns in charge of the interior department the reports of its secretary present an interesting summary. Among the topics deserving of particular atten­ tion, I refer you to his observations respecting our Indian affairs, the pre-emption and timber culture acts, the failure of railroad companies to take title to lands granted by the govern­ ment, and the operations of the pension office^ the patent office, the census bureau and the bureau of education. Allusi has been made already to the cir­ cumstance that both as between different Indian tribes, and as between Indians and the whites, tha past year has been one of unbroken peace. In this circumstance the president is glad to find justification for the policy of the government in dealing with the Indian question and confirmation of the views which were fully expressed in his first communication to the Forty seventh congress. The secretary nr^es anew enactment of state for the punish­ ment of crimes committed on Indian reserva­ tions and recommends the passage of the bill, now pending in the house of representatives, for the purchase of a tract of 18,000 square miles from the Sioux reservation. Both these measures are worthy of approval. I concur with him also in advising the repeal of the pre-emption* law, the enactment of statutes resolving the present legal complications tending the lapses of grants to railroads and the funding of the debt of the several Pacific railroads under such guaranty as shali insure its ultimate payment. The report of the Utah commission will be read with in­ terest it discloses thf» results of recent legislation looking to the prevention and punishment' of polygamy in that territory. I still believe if that abominable practice cannot be suppressed by law it can only be by the moBt radical legis­ lation consistent with restraints of the constitu­ tion. 

GENERAL GRANT. I recommend that in recognition of the emi­ nent services of 0. S. Grant, late general of the armies of the United States and twice president of the nation, congress con­ fer upon hid a suitable pension. Certain of the measures that seem to me necessary and expedient,. I have now. in obedi­ ence to the constitution, recommended for your adoption as respects others of no less import­ ance, I shall content myself with renewing the recommendations already made to congress without restating the groands upon which such recommendations were based. The preservation of forests on the public domain, the granting cf government aid for popular education, the amendment of the federal constitution GO as to make effective the disapproval by the president of particular items in appropriation bills, the enactment of statutes in regard to the filling of vacancies in the presidential office and the determining of vexed questions respecting presidential inability, are measures which may receive your serious consideration. As the time draws nigh wnen I am about to retire from public servicc, I cannot refrain from ex­ pressing to the members of the national legis­ lature, with whom I have been brought into personal and official intercourse, my sincere appreciation of their unfailing courtesies and harmonious co-operation with the executive in so many measures calculated to promote the best interests of the nation and to my fel tow citizens generally, I acknowledge a deep sense of obligation for the support which they have accorded me in the administration of the executive department of the government.

LOUISVILLE, Ky.,Nov. 29.—Arthur H. Loom is, a traveling representative from New York, ar­ rived today, having just returned from a trip through the plague stricken "district of eastern Kentucky. Mr. Loomis said: "I was four days in Martin county without disposing of a single article. The people are absolutely crazy. They have no use for anything but coffins. A great deal has been printed in the newspapers about the situation in Martin and adjoining counties, but it has been but an imperfect reflex of the existing deplorable condition. I know of in­ stances whf re whole families have died within a week where a neighborhood has been swal­ lowed up in tfce grave where one ma has sur vired to bury his family and his friends and then been found dead, with no living creature near him except in some cases a faithful dog Flocks of sheep and droves of cattle that Died to browse on the hillside and along the rai ges of the Cumberland, now lay dead and rotting, while the pebbles glisten on the bottom of creek beds. Wells and cisterns have been drained to the bottom, and springs are no longer to be relied upon for a supply of water. The ground is literally parched, where vegetation formerly bloomed luxriantly there is nothing but decay. Thousands are said to h^ve died within the last two weeks. "What in the opinion of natives, is the cause of this fatal calamaty It is very evident that the chief agent of death is starvation. The people in these dis­ tricts are almost without communication with the out side world. An occassional drummer THE BISMARCK WEEKLY TRIBUNE. PEG. 5, 1884. -..^ -7 like myself strays among them onoe a year and a few of the moat prosperous visit some large cities onoe in a lifetime. A good season brings with it bountiful crops wool and othir native products are rudely manufactured into clothing bnt when crops fail the order of things is reversed. I am speaking now of tne backwoods neighborhoods, where the plague has raged with the greatest fatality. I learned while in Martin county that the crop yield tor two successive seasons had been a failure. The natives were wit-eat money and means to purchase bread. The shutting off of the water supply has brought to the sur­ face a poisonous liquid, an-1 famished for water the people drank it and the consequence was death. The first symptoms are violent gripings and after this raging headache. Hot fever en­ sues and the patient usually lingers two days, suffering mental agony, before death. I urder stand several physicians have been commis sioned by states to make careful analyses of the water and describe the poisonous ingredients. Relief has recently been dispatched to Martin from neighboring counties. Before I left there was alight rainfall with prospects of continued falling weather. The opinion prevails that the plague has passed through its most dangerous stages and is now on the wane. During the last two days of my stay I beard of very few deaths." Death of Oklahoma Payne. WELLINGTON, Kans.,Nov. 28 —Capt David L. Payne, the famous leader of the Oklahoma boomers, died suddenly here this morning while at breakfast at the hotel De Barand. He ad­ dressed a meeting last night and was seemingly in his usual robust health when he entered the dining room this morning. While partaking of breakfast he was observed to lean forward and utter a subdued sound as if from slight suffooa tion when he dropped from his ohair to the floor 'and expired instantly. The coroner's inquest is now in session. His sudden taking off created no little sensation here among his coworkers and followers in attempting to settle in Indian territory. Mexicans vs. Americans. TOMBSTONE, Ariz., Nov. 28.—News just received of an affray which occurred on Sunday last between Mexican police and a number of Americans at Cananea, a copper camp in Sonora, which resulted in the death of an American teamster named Lee and the mur­ dering of several Mexican policemen. A mer senger was immediately dispatched to the commander of the Mexican troops at Santa Cruz, Sonora, and he sent a detachment of forty men, who demanded the surrender of the Americans. The latter refused, bnt were per­ suaded by the officers of the copper mining company to do so. Two Americans escaped and the remaining fifteen were marched off to Santa Cruz. Officers of the copper mining company accompanied them. The Dynamiters. DUBLIN, Nov. 28,—An attempt was made at Tralee last night, which nearly proved success­ ful, to destroy with dynamite the residence of Samuel Hussey, known as Edinbnrn house. Many windows and portion of the eastern wall of the house were badly shattered. No one was-burt. It' is believed the explosion was placed in the sewer under the back part of the house. After the explosion the house looked at though it had been bombarded. A split several inches wide was made in the main wall and reached from the ground to the roof. Great excitement prevails in Cork, where Hussey is exceedingly unpopular. Hussey is one of the largest land agents in Ireland and it has been known that there was a plot against his life. He Didn't Get It. FARGO, NOV. 28.—Bert Davis waB arrested while attempting to cash a draft made by the Northern Pacific Elevator company on the Merchants National bank of St. Paul. The amount was $925. The bank was suspicious and sent for President Barnes, of the Elevator company, when Davis acknowledged he had anotber for $1,253 and a third for $15,000 on the Bank of America, of New York, but claimed he found them in an envelope on the floor of the Fargo postoffice. Ha was held in $1,000 bail. Wants a Writ of Mandamus. 

SPRINGFIELD, 111., Nov. 23.—Attorneys for Brand,the democratic candidate for state senate from the Sixth district, between whoso claims to election and those of Leman the state board of canvassers declined to decide, tonight filed a petition in the circuit court for a writ of man damns to compel the board to certify to the governor that Brand had a majority on the face of the returns and is entitled to the certificate of election. Petition will be beard tomorrow or Tuesday. Discovery of a Kembrandt Gem. LOUISVILLE, Ky. Nov. 28.—Herman Linde, of New York, a well known Shakespearean reader, is in the city, and while looking through the Polytechnic art gallery discovered a picture which he says is Rembrandt's ''S'aughter of the Innocents," a painting celebrated in history, for which search has been made for years. Mr. Linde purchased the picture for $100 from the owner, Robert Magness. How the picture came into his possession is unknown, but it is un­ doubtedly a Rembrandt. Went to His Death. PORT CHESTER, N. Y., NOV. 28.—Charles T. Goodwin, of the firm of ChHrles Goodwin & Co., cracker manufacturers, New York, left his house about 2 o'clock this morning in a distrac­ ted -tate of mind, uttering horrible outcries.

Goodwin was 62 years old and leaves a widow and five children. Bank Failure. MIDDLETOWN, N. Y., NOV. 28.—The Middle town National bank has failed. The doors closed this morning. The failure was caused by President Thomas Kins, who accepted large drafts of Indianapolis and Burlington, Iowa, without security. The bank's capital is $200,000, surplus $115,000. The extent of the loss is not definitely known yet. Depositors will lose nothing. President King takes all blame upon himself. The Illinois Senatorial Fight. 

CHICAGO, NOV 28.—The state canvassing board today derided in the Leman-Brand contest that from the testimony given before it, it conld not decide which of the candidates, Brand, Demo­ crat, or Leman, republican, was entitled to the oertifioate of election. They referred the matter to General Hamilton for final decision and the general stated he would render a deoiaion in the case next Monday. Perished In the Swamp. OCONTO, Wis., Nov. 28.—On Saturday last, Mrs. John Wattacounit and a twelve year old daughter attempted to walk a distance of twelve miles, returning from the funeral of the mother's sister to their home near here. They evidently lost their way and perished from the severe cold in the extensive swamp surrounding Sbawanee lake. The bodies were discovered by searching parties this afternoon frozen stiff. The Week's Failures. NEW YoRKj Nov. 28.—Failures for the last seven days reported by R. G. Dunn & Co: United States, 222 Canada, 27 total, 249. This is a decrease of twenty-eight as com­ pared with last week Furniture Scorched. PITTSBUEG, Pa., Nov. 28.—Fire broke out at 8 o'clock this morning in the building occupied by Edmnnson & Sons as a furniture ware room in the rear of the Seventh Avenue hotel. In the ware room was stored a large lot of holiday stock and b-fore the flames were controlled Ed­ mnnson sustained a loss of $50,000, and the building, which is owned by John Danl, was damaged $20,000. An Knslish Opinion. LONDON, Dec. 2.—It is reported that Abram S. Hewitt, of New York, will be the probable successor of Minister Lowell. The Pall Mall Gazette says Hewitt's eminent position as a philanthropist and his free trade views fit him exceedingly for the position, but whoever comes to England will find Lowell a very difficult man to succeed. Fire in a Piano Factory. NEW YORK, Nov. 2.—Just before ten o'clock tonight fire broke out in the engine room of Fischer's piano factory, West Twenty-eighth street, and for a time threatened the complete destruction of the immense buildings owned by the firm, and the flats and tenements adjoining. The fire spread rapidly and the inmates of ad­ jacent houses rushed to the street in every con­ dition of apparel and bringing with them every portable article they possessed. The heat was intense and firemen directing the hese were relieved at short intervals. The principal efforts were directed toward saving the big building. At midnight the fire was under coniral. Damage estimated at $125,000, of which $75,000 is on stock. Only partial in surance. Leman Gets It. SPRINGFIELD, 111., Nov. 2.—Governor Hamil­ ton has just rendered a decision in the Leman Brand case and after an elaborate review of the evidence and a citatien ot authorities awards the certificate to Leman, the republican candidate for state senator in the Sixth district. The federal grand jury today made a formal report in the Leman-Brand case declaring that evidence of fraud and forgery ia clearly shown by the testimony. The jury returned a number of indictments, but the names there indicated are not yet made public. The Parisian Sensation. PARIS, Dec. 2—Morin,shot by Madam Hugue, remains in a desperate condition. He utters the mOBt agonizing shrieks. Clovis Hugue re ceives anonymous letters daily, menacing him with death, to which he replies that he has a six shooter ready for the writers. He also receives some 200 letters daily congratulating him upon his wife's action. Fatal Runaway. FARGO, D. T„ Deo. 2.—As M. O. Hixom was driving a spirited team near Hickson, on the Fargo Southern, seventeen mileB south of this city, it ran away and struck a post, throwing him out, striking upon his bead and killing him instantly. Hixom was formerly a member of the legislature of Minnesota and at one time commissioner of Cass county, a prosperous, esteemed farmer. A Well Stocked Barn Burned. FARGO, Dec. 2.—Early this morning the large barn of W. Smith, fix miles north of Wheat­ land, was burned with $5,000 worth of grain and property partially insured. The cause is unknown.

WINDON, Minn., Dec. 2.—J. W. Green, a farmer living ten miles north of here, while under the influence of liquor, accidentally set fire to bis house and burned to death. It Is Policy. LONDON, NOV. 2.—The Associated Press is informed upon the best authority that England has recognized the African International associa tion. A SENSIBLE suggestion is made by the governor of Montana in his annual report to the president. He urges that no Mor­ mon practising polygamy be allowed to pre-empt government Jands. If congress is justified in passing laws directly re­ pressive of this hideous offense against laws and morals, which it surely is, it is also justified in using all indirect means to cut off polygamy from the. privileges which belong with right to law abiding citizens. 

ROYALTY'S HEROIC ENDURANCE. An Empress Who Smiles Thouglr Racked With Torture. [Foreign Letter.] Strange and sometimes pathetic are the ways of those royal households of whicl* only the cold, stately splendor meets the eyes How f«w seeing the empress of Germany ful­ filling all the duties of her station, every inclfr a queen, would guess that for eighteen months, since her accident, she has been racked with almost intolerable pain. Unable to walk or leave her chair, she bad herself carried once a week to the Augusta hospital and to the Augusta foundation for the daughters of poor officers and those killed in battle both these institutions are her own work, and shedispenres in person consolation* advice and commands. Every Sunday, well or ailing, she attends divine service, not us her private chapel or oratory, but in one of the public churches. Empress in nam?, slave in fa?t, she shirks none of the obligations, even the most try­ ing ones of her station gives audiences, re­ ceives deputations, is present at all gala cere­ monies and dinners, sees her numerous family, and astonishes the most experienced diplomats and ablest state ministers by the readiness of her wit, her unfailing tact, and profound erudition. Those who see her under the haut pas, ^covered with priceless jewels, robed in her purple mantle fringed with, heavy sables do not realize, that the regal train intentionally thrown over her feet hides the maimed, tortured limb as effectually as her sufferings are concealed under the smile which she turns on the emperor At her right, on the mistress of the robes standing a* little back on the left, or on the ladies bend­ ing low before her in a triple courtesy as they pass. She, who best could reveal the truth and tell of noble endurance and bravo patience, is the old Silesian who was brought from her peasant home' in the provinces to give the sovereign relief by her deft manipulations^ She has done nothing else since her child­ hood, and the professional gift of healing: frictions is hereditary in her family, as it is with many of the Silesian shepherds. Thi» aged woman rubs the empress twice, some­ times three times a day, according to the in­ tensity of the pain, and is rarely away from her now. She follows her in her drives, to church, in her travels she sits in the ante­ room during the Thursday receptions, in a tribune during the royal balls and concerts, a quaint, homely and picturesque figure. Unwilling to part from her even for a short visit to her native village, the empress sent for her daughter, already a mature woman, to come to Berlin, and lent her a court car­ riage to visit all the lions and places of inter­ est. The old Silesian pea ant is loud ia praise of her royal patient, and perhaps no more sincere tribute is paid to the courageous endurance and kindly nature of the muchr tried sovereign. A Study in Humau Nature. [Boston Globe.] "See the dude, the dandy dude!" "Shut up, you dirty little street ragamuffin, or I'll punch your head!" Then they went for each other like two bull pups. One had on a pair of cotton^ jumpers with a hole in the seat, and a tat­ tered shirt the other was dressed in the height of boy fashion. They were about of a size and the crowd cheered while they punched each other's noses, chewed each others ears and scratched each other's eyes. The ragamuflin had the most science, but the little dude was in the best condition physi­ cally. Suddenly a bluecoat dropped down from somewhere. The crowd received an. electric shock, and some one called out: "Skit! a peeler!" Then the little dude pulled his fingers out of the ragamuffin's greasy hair, and the raga­ muffin let go of the little dude's ear, and away went the two, while the strong arm of the law rattled for help and then started in pur­ suit. "Follow me," shouted the ragamuffin to the little dude, and they disappeared together in a labyrinth of alleys. The. policeman gave up the chase, sat down on a doorstep and cooled off, and then went ai.way. Then The lobe reporter did likewise, but cogitating on the magnanimity suddenly dis­ played by the young arab and wondering if he did not intend to get the little dude off somewhere alone and then try to annihilate him But not long after he happened upon the two again. They both seomed quite happy, and the ragamuffin was saying, as he dangled a brand-new outfit for a first-class shine: "Thankee, old boy. Didn't mean what I said—only was giving you guff. It's all right, old pard, isn't it?" And the little dude replied: "It's all right now. Good, bye, 1 hope yore will have good luck." Put Off Use Train. [Cincinnati Times St u\ I Ha rry Famy, the well know is Cincinnati artist and tourist, was returning i.ome over* the International Great Northern railroad^ last winter. While going across the dreary plains of Dakota when night set in, tired: Farny leaned back in his seat and in a few moments was fast asleep.
