Following is in substance the ati uaal message of President Roosevelt, as read in both houses of Congress ; Introduction. . T* the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: The people of this country continue to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubt edly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebb and flow will be felt more or leas by all mem ber* of, the community, both by the deserving Against the wrath of the Lord the wis dom of man can not avail; in times the undeserving. and of flood or drought human ingenuity hut partially repair the disaster •an are innocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of the folly. A panic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the business com munity would hurt the whole business sommunity. But such stoppage of welfare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting. In the long run the one vital factor in the per manent prosperity of the country is the high individual character of the average American worker, the aver age American citizen, no matter whether his work be mental or man iai, whether he be fanner or wage worker, business mail or professional man. In our industrial and social system tbe interests of all men are so closely ooneemed. Normally the wage-work er, the man of small means, and the ! average consumer, as well as the av erage producer, are all alike helped j by making conditions such that the j raao of lional bu.ino,, .Wlity ' receives an exceptional reward for his ability. Something can be done by leg- | ialation to help the general prosper- 1 ity; but no such help of a perman ently beneficial character can be given to the less able and less fortunate, save as the results of n policy which ahall inure to the advantage of all in dustrious and efficient people who act - cme.

Normally the man of great productive capacity who be comes rich by guiding the labor of many other men does so by enabling them to produce more than they could produce without his guidance; and both he and they share in the benefit, which comes also to the public at large. The*superficial fact that the sharing may bo unequal must never blind us to the underlying fact that there, is this sharing, and that the ben efit comes in some degress to each man tunate must of necessity come even more to the more able and more for tunate. If, therefore, the less for tunate man is moved by envy of his more fortunate brother to strike at the conditions under which they have both, though unequally, prospered, the result will assuredly he that while damage may come to the one atruck at it will vmit with an even heavier load tbe one who as a whole we must all go up or go down together. strikes the blow.

Some men find it easier to acquire a reputation than to earn a living I contempt for law which the failure to enforce law inevitably produce^. We should, moreover, recognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effected by corporate agencies in a country such as ours, and the wealth of intellect, energy, and fidelity devot ed to their service, and therefore nor mally to the service of the public, by their officers and directors. The cor poration has como to stay, just ns the trade union has come to stay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so long as it does good. But each should be sharply checked where it acts against law and justice. So long as the finances of the Nation are kppt upon an honest basis no other question of internal economy with which the Congress has the pow er to deal begins to approach in im portance the matter of endeavoring to secure proper industrial conditions under which the individuals—and es pecially the great corporations—doing an interstate business are to act. The makers of our National Constitution provided especially that the regulation of interstate commerce should come within the sphere of the General Gov ernment. The arguments in favor of their taking this stand were even then overwhelming. But they are far stronger to-day, in view of the enor mous development of great business agencies, usually corporate in form, Experience has shown conclusively ''hat it is useless to try to get any adequate regulation and supervision of these great corporations by State action. Such regulation and supervis ion can only be effectively exercised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction is coextensive with the field of work of the corporations—that is, by the Nat ional Government. I am well aware of the difficulties of the legislation that 1 am suggest ing, and of the need of tenijicrate and cautious action in securing it. 1 should* emphatically protest against improp erly radical or hasty action. The first thing to do is'to deal with the great corporations engaged in the business of interstate transportation. As I said in my Message of December (i last, the immediate and most pressing need. so far as legislation is concern ed, is the enactment jnto law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the Government such supervision and reg ulation of tbe rates charged by the ra il roads of the country engaged in interstate traffic as shall summarily and effectively prevent the inqtnsitinn of unjust or unreasonable rates. It must include putting a complet« stop to rebates in every shape and form. This {tower to regulate rates, like all similar {lowers over the business world, should be exercised with modi ficâtion, caution and self-restraint ; but it should exist, so that it can be effectively cxeeised when the need frises. The first consideration to be kept in mind is that the {»ower should be affir mative and should be given tb some administrative body created by the Congress. # ui P2ni i irnns'intim» der the forms of law Him- r fF* "l eurral that a shinner hn - H ^V'n b"T ,r.nt offl^iT.o ÎL ", ,oW quantity of some cnmmndd« a A duction is IQa de in Pate take^effect immediately the amn .pm«»» ,« n in«- to the damage n f "nil ti ; SU L L ^«t the' b£ slnn^rs ^ ni S much to blame as anv railr . t ' «u* matter of rebates The law should gjghäj» .,»id on frefeht .hipmen,». or paMen ^ r r f te ' or pajmnnt of brokerage, is illegal.

I I urge upon the Congress the need of providing for expeditioua action by the Interstate Commerce Commis sion in all these matter», whether in regulating rates for transportation or for storing or handling property oommodities in transit. The history of the eases litigated under the pres ent commerce act shows that its effi eacay has been to a great debtee des troyed by the weapon of delay, al most the most formidable weapon in the banda of those whose purposo it is to violate the law. or to We a by the the im es of is of Safety Appliances. . In my annual Message to the Fifty eighth Congress, at its third session I called attention to the necessity'for legislation requiring the use of block signals upon railroads engaged in interstate commerce. The number of serious collisions upon unblocked roads' that have occurred within the past year adds force to the recom mendation then made. The Congress should provide, by appropriate legis lation, for the introduction of block signals upon all railroads engaged in interstate commerce at the earliest practicable date, as a measure of in creased safety to the traveling pub lie. Hours of Labor of Railroad Em ployees. The excessive hours of labor to which railroad employees in train ser vice are in many cases subjected is also a matter which may well engage the serious attention of the Con The strain, both mental and giess. physical, upon those who art engaged in the movement and operation of railroad trains under modern condi tions is perhaps greater than that which exista in any other industry, and if there are any reasons for limit ing by law the hours of labor in any employment, they certainly apply with {teculiar force to the employment of those upon whose vigilance and alert ness in the performance of their du ties the safety of alt who travel by rail depends.

It is not possible to lay down any general rule which to determine the moment when t he reasons for will outweigh those against such a change. Much must depend, not merely on the needs, but on the desires, of the people as whole; for needs and desires are not necessarily identical. Of course change can be made on lines benefi cial to, or desired by, one section or one State only. There must something like a general agreement among the citizens of the several States, as represented in the Con gress, that the change is needed and desired in the interest of the people a whole; and there should th p n be a sincere, intelligent, ami disinter ested effort to maîce it in such shape as will combine, so far as {»ossible, the maximum of good to the people at large with the minimum ©f neces sary diregard for the special interests of localities or classes. But in time of peace the revenue must on the av erage, taking a series of years to gether. equal the expenditures or else the revenues must he increased. Last year there was a deficit. Unless our expenditures can he kept within the revenues then our revenue laws must be readjusted. Economy in Exepnditures. I earnestly recommend to the Con gress the need of economy and to this end of a rigid scrutiny of appro priations. As examples merely, I call your attention to one of two specific matters. All unnecessary offices should be abolished, sinner of the General l and Office recommends the abolishment of the of fice of receiver of public moneys for United States land offices. Vet, in speaking of economy, I must in no wise be understood as advo cating thp false economy which is in the end the worst extravagance. To cut down on the Navy, for instancef would he a crime against the Nation. To fail to push forward all work on the Panama Canal would be as great a folly. At varions times I have instituted investigations into the organization and conduct of the business of the Executive Departments. While none of these inquiries have vet progressed far enough to warrant final conclu sions. they have already confirmed and emphasized the general imres sion that the organization of the De partments is often faulty in princi ple and wasteful in results, while many of their business methods are a (liquidated and inefficient. There is every reason why our executive governmental machinery should be at least as well planned, economical, and efficient as the best machinery of the great business organizations, which at present is not the case. Monroe Doctrine. One of the most effective instru ments for peace is the Monroe Doc trine as it has been and is being grad ually developed by this Nation and accepted by other nations. No other pofiey could have been as efficient in promoting peace in the Western Hemisphere and in giving to each na tion thereon the chance to develop aUng it* own lines. If we had refused to apply the Doctrine to changing conditions it would now be complete ly outworn, would not meet any of the needs of the present day, and indeed would probably, by this time have sunk into complete oblivion. It is useful at home, and is meeting with recognition abroad because we have adapted our application of it to meet the growing and changing needs of our Hemisphere. When we announce a poliey, such ns the Monroe Doc trine, we thereby commit ourselves to the consequences of the policy, and those consequences from time to time alter. It is out of the question to claim a right and yet. shirk the re sponsibility for its exercise. Not on ly we, but all American Republics who arc benefitted by the existence of the Doctrine, must recognize the obligations each nation is under regards foreign peoples no less than its duty to insist upon its own rights. That onr rights and interests are deeply concerned in the maintenance of the Doctrine is as clear as hardly to need argument. This is especially true in view of the construction of the Panama Canal. As a mere mater of self-defense we must exercise a "lose watch over the approaches to his canal; and this means that we lust be thoroughly alive to oor inter sts in the Caribbean Sea. .fljswor areea iMdfes Ezrh hrdluu Santo Domingo.

The President touches upon the question of Federal elections, quot ing the well known constitutional provision that Congress shall be the final judge of the qualification of its own members. He also declares strongly against ail forms of corrup tion and expresses regret at the grow ing tendency to increase exjienses in connection with the conduct of po litical campaigns. Briefly, he ad vocates the greatest possible purity of (lie ballot and the f niest free dom of the exercise of the elective franchise consistent with good gov ernment. Immigration. Thes ubject of immigration is treat ed by Mr. Roosevelt in a particular ly able and thoughtful manner. The tendency of foreigners to congregate in sections of the country already congested with people is deplored. High-class foreigners are desirable and are welcomed, but only those with tendencies towards good citizen ship and of industrious and law-ab iding habits will add to the general welfare of the nation. It is pointed •at * that our farming sections need labor, and that nil who come with a will to work will find a ready welcome. Criminal Laws. by that it Gen. H. In ray last Message I asked the attention of the Congress to the ur gent need of action to make our criminal law more effective; and I most earnestly request that yon pay heed to the report of the Aattorney General on this subject. Centuries ago it was especially needful to throw every safeguard round the ac cused. Such danger then was lest he should he wronged by the state. The danger is now exactly the reverse. Breaches of Trust in Public Service. Thenp seems to be no statute of the United States which provides for the punishment of a United States attorney or other officer of the Government who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully re-jin fratn from doing any act when the consideration for such corrupt agree ment, is other than one possessing money vaine. This ought to be reme died hy appropriate legislation. both has tries, and Public Land Laws. Once again I call your attention to th* condition of the public-land laws.

The iniquitous methods by whieh the monopolizing of the public lands is being brought about under the present laws arc becoming more generally known, but the existing laws do not furnish effective remedies.
