PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. -fW/oir Citizen* nf the Semite Mil ttonar of ItrprrtcnlalieeM : Again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest grutitude to -Almighty God. The condition of our foreign affairs is rca onnbly satisfactory. Mexico continues to be b theatre of civil war. While oer political delations with that country have undergone ho change we have at the same time strictly hiniutaincd neutrality between the belliger ents. At the request of tho "Mates of fosta Hiea nnd Nicaragua, a competent engineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan, and the port of San Juan. It is n source of much satisfaction that tile difficulties which for a moment excited some political ap prehensions, nud tfaltsud a closing of the inter oeeanic transit route, have been amicably ad justed, and that there is a good prospect that the rout* will soon be reopened, with an in crease of capacity and adaptation. WceOuld hot exaggerate either the commercial Of the political importance of that gfcitl improve ment. It would be doing injustice to Ah important South American State not to acknowledge the directness, ftankncs and cordiality with which the United States of Columbia have entered into the intimate relations with this Govern ment. A claims convention has been consti* luted to conipi te the unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861. The new liberal Constitution of A enezncla haling gone into effect with the univerW quiescence of the people, the Government i under it has been recognized, and diplomatic ' intercourse with it has opened in a cordial ami ; fricu lly spirit. The long deferred Aves Island claim has been sati f ictorily paid nnd adjusted. Mutual payments have been made of tie j Claims awarded by the hit-joint commission ' for the settlement of claims between the I United States and l'eru. An earnest and j cordial friendship continues to exist between j the two countries, and sueli oObrts as were in mv power have been used to remove niisun I del-standing and avert a threatened war he-j tween l'eru and Spain. Our relations are of the most friendly nature , frith Chili, tho Argentine licp ddie, Uoliva, j Costa llica, Paraguay, S.ui ri.i! vaderc and j Ilayti. During the }>;•* t year mi differences 1 of any kin 1 have arieeu with any of those •lb-publies, and on tho other hand their sym pathies wiOi (he United States are constantly expressed with cordiality and earn,-flues*. The claim arising from the seizure of the i Cargo of the brig Macedonian, in 1821, lia. ; been paid in full by tbe Government of Chili. Civil Wat - continues in the £pniih>h part of Han Domingo, apparently wit', dat prospect of tn t'rifly close-. Official correspond en"" lias been freely opened willi Itibcriu, ami it gives us a pleasing View of serial ami ami political progress in that Republic. It tony be expected to derive new vigor from American iufim.-neos, improved by t''o ritpid disappearance of C-lllVjry in the \jnit.el States. [ solicit your authority to furnish to tile Republic a gun bo it at modcr. ate cost, to be reimbursed to the I'liited States by installments. Such a vend is needed for the safety of thill State against the native Afiicnn races, atid ill JoDeiiiiit hai-.tls it would be more efficthe in arresting tb African slave trad; than a squadron in our own bauds. The pnSgMfeidn elf lltct liliisl or gnnized naval fordo would stimulate a gener ous amo tion in the Republic, and the confi dence which We should manifest by furnishing it would win furbenriliiee and f.Dor toward the colony from nil civilize 1 nations. fhe proposed overland telegraph between America ami i'i'iropCj by tile way to HehritlgS Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was eitne tioned by Congress at the last session, lias been undertaken, under very favorable cir c-uni itances, by an association of American citizens, with the cordial good will and sup port as well of this Government as of those of Great Urittnin and Russia. Assurances have been received from most of the South Ameri can States of their high appreciation of the enterprise, and their readiness to co-operate in constructing lines tributary to that world encircling eomin indention 1 learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a tele graphic communication between the eastern l-oast of America and Great Rritnin has been reuewod, with full expectation of its early ac aceoinpiisliiiieut. Thus it is hoped that with the return of do mestic peace the country will Ire able to rc suino with energy and advantage its former high career of commerce and civilization. Our very popular and cstimablo representa tive in Kgypt, died in April last. An un pleasant altercation which aroso between the temporary incumbent of the office and the Government of the l'aclia resulted in a sus pension of intercourse. The evil was prompt ly corrected ou the arrival of the successor in the Consulate, and our relations wit'i Kgypt, as well as our relations with the linrLary Powers, are entirely satisfactory. The rebellion which I) is so long been flag rant in China has at last been suppressed with the co-operating good offices of this Govern- ruent and of tho other Western commercial Htatcs.

VOLUME XXXVII. | ter course Among tlic Western nabob's. Owing to (lie peculiar situation of Japan, | and the nnonialnus form of its Government, (lie action of that Empire in performing treaty stipul&tldDs is inconsistent ami capricious. Nevertheless, good progress has been effected by the Western Powers moving with enlight ened concert. < )ur own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settle ment. and the ihland Sea has been reopened to commerce. Thefr* is reason also to believe that these proceedings hive increased rather han diiniiiislic I the friendship of Japan to ward the Unite 1 States. The port* of Norfolk, Fcrnandina and l'cn sacola have been opened by proclamation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now con sider whether it is not safer and more profita ble to themselves, as well as just to the United States, to resort to these and other open ports, than it iS to pursue, through many hazards, and at vast cost, n contraband trade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual mili tary occupation, at least by a lawful and effec tive blockade For myself, I liavc no doubt of the prttViT and duty of the executive, under the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the United Stales. If Congress should think that proceedings ill such cases lack the authority of law, or ought lo be further regulated by it, I recommend that provision be made for effectually prevent ing foreign slave traders from acquiring dom cile ami faculties for their eilniinal occupation in our country. I It is possible that if it were a now and open ' question, the maritime I'owers, with the lights i they now enjoy, would not concede the pi-iv- J ilegesof a naval bcligcrent M the iltsUrgettts of the United States, destitute as they are, and always hav l ' bcclt, equally of ships of war and of ports and harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither less as.-Tluous "or more successful during the last year than they were before that time in their efforts, under favor of tliat privilege, to euibriffl our country in foreign wars. The desire nnd determination of the Gov ernments of maritiiie States to defeat that de sign arc folic veil to be as sincere as, and can not be more earnest than, our own. Never theless, unfursccn political difficulties have arisen, especially in Hrnzilliaii aud Hrilish per 8 a d on tho Northern boundaries of the United States, which have required and un likely to continue to require the practice of Kons'aut Vigilalitfo, And a just and conciliatory Spirit on ho pa.t of tho United >talcs, as well us of the nati ns concerned, and their Gov ernments. (j nnniissioners have been ap pointed tinder the treaty of Great Hritain on the adjustment of the claims of the Hudson Hay and I'Uget .Sound Agricultural Compan ies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution of illc trust assigned to tlieni. In view of tb" insecurity vf life and tfopurt.y iu the region adjacent to the Cunddli'.il border, by reason of rc'fellt nssuults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it hrfs beHU tllollglit proper to give notice that after the expiration of six hlrltlths—the period conditionally stip ulated under th" ex'sting agreement with GrCat Hritain—the United StateS must hold them selves it lit 6rty to increase tlu-ir hitirhl armament ii] O.i the Lakes, if they Shall Bud that pi'iiccodiiig ticccssaiy. The conditloll of the border wil' necessarily come into consider ation in Aotiiiection with the question of con tinuing ttr modifying l'o rights of transit from Canada through tlie United States, as well as the regulation nt imposts, which were tempo rarily established by the recipftloily treaty of the full of June, 18f4. 1 desire, however, to lie Understood; While making this statement, that the Colonial authorities of Canada arc not deemed to lie intentionally unjust or Unfriend ly towards the t'liited States, but; otl the con trary, there is every r. A-on (tt ttxpcdt tliut, with the approval of the Imperial Government they will take the ncrossary measures to pre vent new incursions across the borders. The act passed at tbe last session for the encouragement of emigration has, so far as was possible, been put into operation. It seems to need amendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent the practice of frauds against the emigrants while on their way and on their arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of avo cations aud places of settlement. A liberal dispositiou towards this great national policy is manifested by most of the Kuropcan States, aud ought to be, especially on our part, by giving llio emigrants effective national protec tion. I regard our emigrants aa one of the principal replenishing streams which arc ap portioned by Providence to repair the ravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength nnd health. All that is neccssnry is to secure the flow fit that stream iu its present fulncES, and to that end the Government must in every way muke it manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary mili tary service upon those who come from other l mds to east their lot in coir country. The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully administered during the last year. The legislation of the last ses sion of Congress has beneficially affected the 1 e .Times, although sufficient time has not yet elapsed to cxpcricuce the full effect of several of the provisions of the acts of Congress im posing increased taxation. The receipts during tho year from all sources, upon the basis of warrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and the balance in Treasury on the first day of July, 1863, were $1,394,796, 007,62. j Mfcd the aggregate disbursements upon the c "oWW*1 1 89. having ; sau e ' ' <•

F!)r the actual receipt's ond disbursements J for the first quarter, and the estimated receipts J and disbursement!) for the three remaining quarters of the current fiscal year, and the gciur l operate ns'of the Treasury in detail, 1 refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. I c A-ellr witll liim in tig- opinion that tho proj orlion of moneys required to meet tlie cx |C iscs consequent upon the war derived fro.n taxation, should bo still further incica.iod, and I earnestly invito your attention to (Lis ' subject, to tbo end that there may be such additional legislation as shall be required to meet the jest cxjWClitlibtts "f the Secretary. The public debt oU the Ist day of.l illy last as appears by the books of tbo Treasury, |it mounted to sevtsntien hundred and forty I millions, six hundred and ninety thous and, four hundred And cig! I .-nine dollars and forty-nine cents ($1740,090,480.-19.) L'reb ably, should the war continue for another year, that: nio nt may be increased by not far from five hundred millions. Held as it is for the most part by our own people, it has become a branch of national tltoUgli private property. I l-'ur obvious reasons, the more nearly this ' property can be distribited among all the pco ' pie the Ithllor. To favor such general distri ' bution greater iiiduconicnts to become owners j might, perhaps, with good effect, and without 1 injury, be presented to persons of limited means. With thin view 1 whether it might not bo both competent and expedient j for (joflgress to provide that a limited amount of some future issjo of public securities might ! be held by any boiui jUlr purchaser exempt : from taxation and from seizure for debt, under ! such restrictions ftl'd. limitations as might be ncbessary to guard against abuse of so impor tant a privilege. This would enable every prudent person to set asidew small annuity against a possible day of wniit. Privileges ' like these would render t'"l possession of such ' sccuritiis to the amount limited most desirable ; to every person of sniiill means who might be ' able to save enough for (lie purpose. The ! great advantage of citizens b i: V (J creditors as well as debtors, with relation to the public ' debt, is obvious. Men readily perceive that they cannot lo much oppressed by a debt which they ow" to themselves. Tlib public debt on the first day of July last, although somewhat exceeding the osti ; mate W the TrcaViFy made to Congress at the ' comni liceiiient of the last session, falls short of the estimate of that officer made iu the I preceding December as to its probable amount | at tho begining of this year by tile sum of J §.'1,995,0111. HI. This fact exhibits sHtisfac ! Tory condition and Conduct of tho opcratiritls | of tho Treasury. j The National bntikiug syfitcili is proving to be artfnptablo to enfiitiilits and to the people ) OH Hie d.itli d:iy df Nivcittber, 584 National j llank.H !;d-i beCn ot'gAniKed; a considerable i ' number of which were conversions from State ! Hanks. Changes from tho State systems to j the National systems are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon there will be in the United States no hanks of issuo not authorized by Congress, and no bank note circulation not secured by the Government, | That the Government and the people will , derive great benefit from this change in the I banking system of the country can hardly be questioned The National system will crentc j I a reliable and permanent influence in support I of the National credit, and protect the people | against losses in the use of paper money. Whether or not any further legislation is ad ' visablc for the suppressing of State bank is sues, it will be for Congress to determine. 1 It seems to be quite clear that the Treasury cannot be sutiaf: o'orily conductod unless the Government can exercise a restraining power over the tho bank note circulation of tho couutry. The lleport of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will detail tho cam paigns of the armies in the fields since the date ' of the liJt annual niearnge, ntid also the oper ations of the several administrative bureaus of the War Department during tho last yoar. It will also specify the measures deemed nec -1 ossary for tho National defence, and to keep up and supply tho requisite military force. The ltcpgrt of the Secretary of the Navy ] resents a comprehensive and satisfactory cx i liibit of tho affairs of that Department, and of the naval service. It is a subject of congrat ulation aud laudable pride to our countrymen that a navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so brief a period and Conducted with so much efficiency and sucoc'sfl 1 The general exhibit of the niVy, including ' io-icls uoden construction, on the lsl of Ds- rentier, 1864, shows a total of siz hundred and seventy-otic Vessels; oarryWg ftj'lr thous and six hdndrcd and ten guns, aiiti of 510,- 396 tonS; being aH Actual increase during the year, over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 33 vessels, 107 guns and 4,247 tons. The total riditibdr rif hied At tliiS time in the navel service, including officers, is about fifty one thousand. There have been captured by the navy during the year three huudred and twenty-four vessels, and the whole Dumber of naval captures since hostilities commeDced is thirteen hundred and sevcnty-niuc, of which two hundred and sixty-seven are steamers The gross proceeds * r ising from the sale of condemned prizo property, thus far reported, amount to §14,396,250,51. A large amount ot such proceeds is still under adjudication nnd yet to he repe>-ted. Th" total expendi ture of the Navy Department, of eveby de scription, including the cost of tho kumense squadrons that have been called into existence since the fourth day of March, 1861, to the first day of November 1861 are §238,647,- 262,35. Your favorablo consideration ia invited to the various recommendations of the Secretary of the Nnvy, Especially in regard to a Kavy Yard and suitable establishment for the con struction and repair of iron vosSelC, and the machinery and nrmaturo for our ships to which reference is made in my last annual mcssnge. Your attention is also invited to the views in the report in rc'ation to the leg islation of Pougrcss at its lftsl session in re ; spect to prises oil our intend waters I cord ially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the propriety of creating tiie now rank of Vice Admiral in our Ditval scr viCCi Your attention is invited to the Rcpbft of the Postmaster General for a detailed accouut of the operation and financial condition of tkc Post-oflico Department. The postal revenues for the .year ending June 30, 1804, nmouuted to §12,438,253.77, and (ho expenditures to §12,044,708.20, the excess of expenditures over receipts I'Uing §200,052 42 The views presented by the Postmaster General on tho subject of special grantl by tin Government in aid of (lie establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships, and the policy he rec ommends for the development of increased commercial Intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries, should receive the careful consideration ofCongresj. It is of note-worthy interest tlat the steady expansion of population, improvement arid governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied portions of our (minify have scarcely been checked, much has impodeti or destroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seem to have absorbed al most the entire enorfOflS of the nation. The organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been completed in conformity with law, and thus our excellent system is firmly established in I tori mouitains which once sectcc 1 a barren aud uninhabitable waste between the Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the coast of the Pacific | ocean. The Territories of tho Union arc generally in a condition of prosperity and rapid growth: Idaho and MoHtana, by their gi'ljat distance and the interruption of comuiuiiicatidti With them by Indian hostilitios, have been only partially ofganivd. Hut it i understood these difficulties are abotlt lo disappear, which will pefntit th'Jir govefllttlent, like those of the otherS, !t) go intd speedy and lull opera tion. As intimately connected with and promo tive of this material growth of the nation, I ask the attention of Congress to tbo valuable information nnd important recommendations relative to tbo Public Lands, Indian Affairs, the Pacific Ilailroad and mineral discoveries, contained in the Report of the Secretary of tho liilefior, which is herewith transmitted, and which report also embraces tho subjects of patents, pensions, and other matters of public intorcst pertaining to his Department. The quantity of publio land disposed of during the five quarters ending 30th Decem ber last was 4,1121.342 acres, of which 1,538,- 014 acres wore entered under the Ilomestcad law. The remainder was located with mili tary land warrauts, agricultural scrip certified to States for railroads und sold for cash. The cash received from sales and location foes was $1,019,446. The income from salos during tho fiscol year ending June 30, 1864, was $678,007.21, against $136,077.95 received during the pre ceding year. The aggregate number of seres surveyed during the year has been equal to the quantity disposed of, and there is open to scttlcmeut about 133,000,000 acres of sur veyed land. The great enterprise of connecting the At lantic with the Pacific States by railways and telograph linos has been entered upon with t vigor that gives assuranee of success, notwith standing the ffmbarsssment arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of the nmin Hue of the road hus been definitely located for one hundred miles westward from the initial point at Omaha city, Nebraska, and a preliminary location of the Pacific RaiWowd of California has been made from Sacramento to the great brtri of tho Truckee river ii> Nevada. Nnmervtra dfeeoveries of grid ant> silver, trad cinnabar mines, have be eft added to- the many heretofore known, and (be country oc cupied by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Moun tains and tho subordinate ranges, now teems with enterprising labor, which is riehly re munerative. It itl>elievod that the product of the mines of precious metals in that region has during the year reached, if not exce'dlu, one hundred millions in vain-. Ft Was recommended in my Ust annual m-sssago that our Indian system be remodeled. Congress, nt its last session, acting upon the recommendation, did provide for reorgan izing the system in California, and it is be lieved tllat under the present organization the management 4f the Indians there will be at tended with reasonable success Much yet remains to be dono to provide for the proper government of the Indians in other parts of the country, to render it secure for the Al - settler, and to provide for the Welfare of the Indian, iho reiterates his recommendations, and to them tho addition of Congress is invited. Tho liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the Republic, and to tho widows, orphans and dependent mothers ol'those who have fallen iu battle, or died of disease con tracted or wounds received in the service of tliC CdUUtry, have beCtl diligently adminis tered. There h:is been added to the pension rolls during '.he year ending the 30th day of Juno last the nanus of 10,770 invalid soldiers, and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number of army invalid pensioners 22,707; aud of navy invalid pensioners, 71-. Of widows, orphans and mothcrß 22,1 'J0 have been placed oil the army pension rolls and 240 on the navy rolls. The present num ber of army pensioners of this class is 25,444, and o f navy pensioners 7'J3. At the begin ning of tile year llle number of ({evolutionary pensioners was 1,440. Only twelve of them were soldiers, of whom seven have since died. The remainder arc those who, under the laws, receive the pcusious bdcausc Of rdlraionship to revolutionary soldiers. During the year end ing the 30th of June, 1804, §4,504,010.02 have been paid to the pensioners of all classes. 1 cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent institutions of the I District of Culumbiri; Which have been cstab | iished aud fostered by Congress, and respect fully refer, for information concerning them, and in relation to the Washington Aqueduct, the Capitol and other matters tf local interest, o the Uuport of the Secretary. The Agricultural Department, under the supervision of its present energetic and faith ful head, is rapidly commending itself to the great and villi! interest it was created to ad vance. It is particularly the pooplcs's de partment, in which they feel more deeply con cerned than in any other. I commend it to the continued uttention and fostering care of Congress. The war continues. Since tile last annual message all the important lines and positions then occupied by our forces have bccu main tained, and our arms have steadily advauced, thus liberating the regions left in rear, so that Misfcburi, Kentucky, Tennessee and parts of other States have again produced reasonably lair crops. The most remarkable feature i!i the mili tary operations of the year is General Sher man's attempt el march of three hundred miles directly through tlid inSUrgcnt region. It tends to show a great increase in our relative strength that our Gcucral-iu-Chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every ac tive force of the enemy, and yet to detach a well-appointed, large army, to move on such au expedition. The result, not yet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not hrro indulged. Important movements have also occurred during the year to the edict of moulding so ciety for durability in the Union. Although short of complete success, it is much in tho right directum that twelve thousand citizens in each of the States of Arkansas and Louis lana have organized loyal Stale Governments with Free Constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to maintain and anminister them. The movements in the same direction, more extensive though less dcfliiiite, in Missourri, Kentucky and Tcnncesec, should not be over looked. Rut Maryland presents the example of complete success. Maryland is secure to Liberty and tluiou for all the future. The genius of rebellion will no more claim Mary land Like another foul spirit, being driven out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo her no more. At the last sesplotl of Congress a proposed amendment of the Constitution abolishing sla very throughout the United States passed the Senate, 1 ut failed for luek of the requisite two-thirds vote in the House of Representa tives. Although the present is the same Con gress and nearly the same members, and with out qucstiouihg the wisdom or patroitism of those who stood in opposition,! venture to recommend the reconsideration and passage of tin measure at tho present session, Of course the abstract question is not changed, but an intervening ejection shows almost certainly that the next Congress will pass the measure f this one does Dot j hence there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action, nnd as it is to go fit all events, tuny we not agree that tbc sooner tho better. It is not claimed that the election has im posed a duty On members to change their views or their votes any further than as an additional clement to be considered how far tlicir judg ment may be afiected by it. It is the voice of the people now for tfhe first time heard upon the qttestion. In a great national crisis like ours unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very desirable—almost in dispensable— and yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable unless some deference shall bo paid to the will of the majority simply became it is tlw will of the majority In this caie tKo common end is tbe maintenance of tbe Uuion, and atnang tlio means to secure that end, such will through the election, is thoSt cleatly declared in favor df SU'-ft consti tutional amendment. The most reliable iu dicati'oh df p'tlblic phrpoSo ih this country is derived through our popular elections. Judg ing by the recent canvass and its result, the purpose of the people within the loyal States to maintain the intogrity of the Union was never more firm, nor more nearly unanimous, than now. The extraordinary calmness ahd good "trier with trhich the millions of voteba tiicl and mingled at the polls give strong assurance df this. Not only all those who supported the Unioh ticket, so called, but a groat majority of tho opposing party also may ho fairly claimed to entertain aiid tb be nCtdutcd by the same purpose. It is an unanswerable argument t<3 this effect that no candidate for an}' office What ever, high or low, has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he wits for giving up the Union. TheVo has been much impugning of motives and touch heated controversy aS to the proper means and best mode of udvuncing the Union cause; but on the distinct issue of Union or no Uniou, the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among tile people. In affording the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to the world this firmness und unanimity o> purpose, the election has been of vast value to the National cause. The election has exhibited another fact, not less valuable to be kuowu. The fact that we do not approach exhaustion ia the most im portant brabch of national sources—tliat of living men. While it is melancholy to re fleet that the war has filled so many graves and carried mourning to so many hearts, it is sonic relief to know that compared fl'itll the surviving, tho fallen having been BO few. While borps and divisions and brigades and regiments have formed and fought and dwin dled and gone out of existence, n great ma jority of the men who composed theui arc still living. The sr.uio is true of tho naval ser vice. The election returns prove this. So many voters could not be found.

A table is appended, showing particulars. To this again should be added the number of all soldiers in the field from Massachusetts, Khode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, liii nois and California, who by thb laws of those States could not vote nway from their homes and which number cannot be less than 90,- 000. Nor yet is this all. The tiumber in organised Territories is triple now what it was four ycrrd ago, while thousands—white and black—joiu irs, as tho National arms press back the insurgent lines. So much is shown affirmatively and negatively by the election. It is not material to inquire how the in crease has becu produced, or to show that it would liuvo been greater but for the war, which is probably true. Tho important fact remains demonstrated that we have more men now than we lunl the war began ; that we are not exhausted, nor iu process of ex haustion that we are gaining strength, and may, if need he, maintain the cuutust indefi nitely, This as to men. Material resources are now moro complete and abuudaut than The National resources tl'cn arc titicxhaus ted, and, at wo believe, inexhaustible. The public purpose to re-establish and maintain the National authority is unchangeable. The manner of continuing the effort remains to choose. On careful consideration of all the ci id-nee accessible, it seems to ino that no attempt nt negotiation with the insurgent leaders could result in nny good, lie would accept nothing short of severance of the I'uion, precisely what we cannot and will not give. His declarations to this effect are explicit and oft-repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. lie utfords us no excuse to deceive our selves. lie cannot voluntarily yield. ]so twecn him and us the issue is distinct, simple and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war and dcoided by victory. If wc ycild—we arc bcolcir. Either way, it would be the victory and defeat following war. ■ffhat is true, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause, is not necessarily true of those who follow. They can at any ttioraci.t have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the National xcthority un der tlo Constitution After so much th; Government could not, if it would, maintain war against them. Although he canttot re accept the Union, they can. Some of them, wc know, already desire peace and Union. The number of such' ttuy increase. Loyal people would cot sustain or allow it. If (Juegtrona should remain, wo wotSld adjust them b y the peaceful means of lcgislrion, coafeiuce, courts and votes, Operating only in conrt't tional and lawful channels.

In what spirit and temper this oontrol would bo xer cised, can be fairly judged of by the past: A year ago general pardon and anidesty, upon specified terms, wero offered to all except 'certain designated classes, and it was at the same time made known that the excepted clxsscs were still in contemplation .of special clemency. Durittg the year many Availed thomselvei of the geh'crnl provision, and many metre wouid; only that the sighs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain; During the same time also, special pardons have been granted to individuals of tbe ex cepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied. Thus priiclically tiie door has been for a full year open to all except such ah Wero not in condition to make free choice—that is, suoh as were in custody or under constraint. It is still so open to all. But the time may come, probably will come, when public duty sball demand that it be closed, and that in lieu more vigorous measures than heretofore sball be adopted.
