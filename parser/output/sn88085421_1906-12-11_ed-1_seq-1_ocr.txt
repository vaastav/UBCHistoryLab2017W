VOLUME XXXVI PRESIDENT SPEAKS IN HIGH TERMS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PORTO Special Message to Congress Tells of Great Fertility of Little Island, Its Excellent School System and Other Great Advantages I W ASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 11.—The president today sent the following special message on his Porto Rican trip to congress: j j.. Senate and House of Repre sentatives: On November 21 I visited the island f Porto Rico, landing at Ponce, cross- Ing by the old Spanish road by Cayey to San Juan, and returning next morn jag over tho new American road from Aretibo to Ponce; the scenery was od< rfully beautiful, a veritable tropic of Switzerland. I could not embark at San Juan because the harbor has not been dredged out and can not receive an Amercan battleship. I do not think this fait creditable to us as a nation, and I earnestly hope that immediate provision will be made for dredging San Juan harbor. I doubt whether our people as a whole realize the beautiy and fertility of Porto Rico, and the progress that has been made under its admirable government. We have just cause for pride in tho character of our represent ees who have administered the tr pic islands which came under our flag as a result of the war with Spain, n i ono of them is this more true in of Porto Rico. It would be im : ssible to wish a more faithful, a more • and a more disinterested pub rvice than that now being ren lered in the island of Porto Rico by

School Children Feature. I stopped at a dozen towns all told, and one of the notable features in every town was the gathering of the school children. The work that has been done in Porto Rico for education has been noteworthy. The main em phasis, as is eminently wise and proper, has been put upon primary ed ucation; but in addition to this there Is a normal school, an agricultural school, three industrial and three high schools. Every effort is being made to secure not only the benefits of ele mentary education to all the Porto Ri cans of the next generation, but also as far as means will permit to train them so that the industrial, agricultural and commercial opportunities of the island can be utilized to the best pos sible advantage. It was evident at a glance that the teachers, both Ameri cans and native Porto Ricans, were de voted to their work, took the greatest pride in it, and were endeavoring to train their pupils,' not only in mind, but in what counts for far more than mind in citizenship, that is, in charac ter. I was very much struck by the ex cellent character both of the insular police and of the Porto Rican regi ment. They are both of them bodies that reflect credit upon the American WINANS STARTS TRAINING Ex-Captain of High School's Best Eleven is Out LA SALLE GROUNDS ARE BEING USED "COMMERCIAL CLUB" ELEVEN IS BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE A TEAM. The Walla Walla "Commercial Club" football eleven had their first practice yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock on the La Salle school grounds. Signal prac tice was the order of exercises and some work in catching punts was also gone through with. Lankard intends to arrange for prac tice every day hereafter until the Christmas game. The program is to have afternoon practice for three days in the week and evening practice for three days and on Sunday afternoon at the old ball park. The afternoon practice will be at the La Salle grounds and Lankard intends to hunt up some convenient place un der a street light in the suburbs for the three nights practice for those boys who cannot get off afternoons and then it is hoped all will get to gether oh Sundays. Lankard received a long distance evening because the members of the committee have been so busy that they have not had time to go into the situation fully. The committee on city extension will make another report this even ing They will meet at 4 o'clock this | afternoon to decide on the nature of, this report in the office of Edward C. Mills chairman of the committee. The members of the committee would not' give any forecast this afternoon of ( what recommendations the committee would make at the meeting tonight, j WALLA WALLA, WASHINGTON, TUESDAY DECEMBER 11, 1906. administration of the island. The in sular police are under the local Porto Rcan government. The Porto Ricans regiment of troops must be appropri ated for by the congress. I earnestly hope that this body will be kept per manent. There should certainly be troops in the island, and it is wise that these troops should be themselves na tive Porto Ricans. It would be from every standpoint a mistake not to per petuate this regiment. Rapid Growth of Sugar. In traversing the island even the most cursory survey leaves the be holder struck with the evident rapid growth in the culture both of the su gar cane and tobacco. The fruit in dustry is also growing. Last year was the most prosperous year that the is land has ever known before or since the American occupation. The total of exports and imports of the island was forty-five millions of dollars as against eighteen millions in 1901. This is the largest in the island's history. Prior to the American occupation the greatest trade for any one year was that of 1896, when it reached nearly twenty three; millions of dollars. Last year therefore, there was double the trade that there was in the most prosperous year under the Spanish regime. There were 210,273 tons of sugar exported last year, of the value of, $14,186,319; $3,555,163 of tobacco, and 28,290,322 (Continued on Page Three.) communication from Pendleton yester day saying that J.

Reports also say that Pendleton will not be able to get ogeher as heavy a line as she had hoped which also makes the Walla Walla footballists smile broadly. Another thing which comfirms that happy look is the fact that Martin, Whitman's sub-end has consented to play with the club team and he with George Gray will make a good pair of punt getters with Durry, the fast lit tle high school man as a close second.

Bolger, proprietor of the Spokane hotel, set men at work to tear down the oldest landmark in Ward ner, the first cabin ever erected in Milo gulch, immediately after the dis covery of the famous Bunker Hill and Sullivan mine. The logs will be cut up and used for fuel at the hotel. The cabin was built In the fall of 1885 by Jack Smith, John King and John Flaherty, all among the very first of the prospectors to reach the field. The house was used for a dwell ing for nearly 20 years and as a wood house of late. The logs are well pre served, hard and dry, and will make excellent firewood. Many interesting stories are connected with the gath erings held in the old abin in the early days and many men now promi nent in mining circles and others long Since dead congregated there durig the winter days of the first rush to the new galena belt of the Coeur d'Alenes. The cabin was built a short distance down the gulch from the discovery point of the Bunker Hill mine. Mr. Bolger has owned the building for years and has been care ful of it because of the past history connected with it as the first cabin In the city of Wardner. Grimes Gives Back $9,000. TOPEKA, Kan., Dec. 11.—Former State Treasurer Grimes today reim bursed the state with over $9,000, the alleged shortage during his adminis tration. obtained all the victim's money and a check for $1350. He immediately came to Walla Walla to present the check for payment. J. F. Smails of this city, identified Wright at the bank and after the money was paid, Wright left for parts unknown. When Wright's victim became sober and realized what he had done, he immediately wired the bank officials in this city to stop payment on the check, but the message arrived too late. Ever since that time, the Frank- and carried them entirely across the street. One thing that proves the storm to have been a part of the Frisco cy clone was that the barometer dropped to 28.40 according to the register in the office of Observer Newman at the same time that the wind blew hardest. Reports fro mother places indicate that the barometer was very low all over the coast yesterday afternoon. In spite of the cloudy weather Ob server Newman looks for more or less settled weather for the next few days wth little rain. The fog is a local affair which is not likely to result in much moisture precipitation, accord ing to the meteorological savant. Legion Stands Up for King.

SMOOT CASE IS UP AGAIN tarns Owens Verbal Bom bardment of Apostle REFERS TO SMITH'S WIVES Utah Polygamist Can Not Serve Morman Church and Government Burrows chairman of the senate committee on privileges and elections opened to Smoot debate this afternoon. In a speech of thirty thousand words carefully prepared, he marshalled his arguments against seating Smoot. Early in the argument he said there was no evidence that Smoot is guilty of polygamy. He referred to the po sition of Smith, leader of the Mormon hierarchy, the husband of five wives and the father of forty-three children. He quoted Smith's testimony that congress had nothing to do with pri vate life. He said Smoot is disqualified because he is a member of the Mor mon hierarchy, his membership inter fering with the functions of state be cause the hierarchy of which he is a member encourages polygamy and be cause Smoot, as a member of the hier archy has taken an oath hostile to the government of the United States and incompatible with his obligations as a senator. He reviewed the domination of the church in politics. He said there is no case in Utah showing the defeat of a man favored by the Mormon church nor of one's election when the church opposed. WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 11.— Smoot listened attentatively to Bur rows, who was apparently unembar rassed. BOOZE SELLERS FILE CLAIMS. Four Saloonmen Who Had Licenses Taken Away Want Money Back. Four of the five saloonkeepers who had their licenses taken away from them by the city council on Novem ber 21, 1905, because of permitting open gambling in their places have filed claims with the city clerk for the amount of their license fee for the time unused. The claim of H. Van Buren was the largest amounting to $536. As his li- lin county authorities have been mak ing a diligent search and officers in other counties throughout this state and Oregon have been keeping a shirp lookout for Wright. A few days ago, Wright was seen in Pendleton, and Sheriff Eubanks im mediately left for that point. By the time the sheriff arrived Wright had come to this city where he was arrested by Sheriff Painter yesterday evening in a local saloon. Fayne Gilman Arrested. DAYTON, Ohio, Dec. 11— Fayne Gilman was arrested this morning charged with being an accessory in the murder of his sister. He was re leased from the custody of his attor ney to appear Friday.

The filing of these claims is said to be a result of the recent action of the city council in refunding a portion of the license fee forfeited by the sa loons who had their licenses taken away for violation of the Sunday clos nig law. The claims will not be brought up until the regular meeting of the council on December IS when they will probably be referred to the finance committee. SUBTLE POISON WAS GIVEN. Supposed Heart Failure of Vrzal's Due to Deadly Toxin. CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 11.—The police are today examining Mrs. Emma Nei man and Jerry Vrzal, children of Rose Vrzal, whose four other children and husband died mysteriously, resulting in the arrest of Herman Billek, a clairvoyant. Physicians suspect an examination of the living will show that the sup posed heart disease of the pair was caused by secret administrations of poison smilarly administered to dead members of the family. This is the first time in this city that the living have been thus examined to secure ev idence as to the death of others. CATHOLICS MUST SUBMIT.

Priests named the services for the week without reference to the illegal statutes which will be assumed after today. The government says it will be forced into a sensational attitude by the intemperate. Cardinal Rich ards, archbishop of Paris, says there will be no violence, only passive re sistance.

The removal of a barrel from be neath his toes has helped many a man to hang until dead but it had ex actly the opposite effect in the case of Phil Finn, a plumber in the em ploy of the G. H. Sutherland com pany. Finn was putting in some gas con nections in the new residence of W. S. Goodwin in Isaac's addition the other afternoon when the accident occurred that narrowly missed being a seri ous one for him. A live electric wire became acci dentally placed across two gas pipes running side by side along the roof of the cellar charging both of them. Finn did not know of this; he mounted a barrel to add a length of pipe to one of them. His barrel tipped slightly and to steady himself he grasped both pip*s. He was terribly shocked but could not let go of the pipes on account of the peculiar effect which electricity (Continued on Page Eight.)

He Is a United States detective and his name is Hugh C. Clark, alias H. Gibson, and he works directly for T. Roosevelt, the president. When he burst into the sanctum sanctorum of the Statesman this morn ing and when he announced his names his mission and his title, the cub re porter fainted and an eyelash of even the managing editor himself was seen to quiver a hair's breadth. Clark arrived here last night fresh from the work of ferreting out the of ficial delinquencies of Major O. C. Edwards, superintendent and agent of the Umatilla reservation in Oregon. He declares that Edwards is guilty as guilty can be and has the bill of fare of his crimes and shortcomings neatly typewritten out and will mail the same to the commissioner of In dian affairs in Washington, D. C, by the very lirst mail. Clark says that he has been spend ing the past several days on the res ervation in tracking i'ovn evidence which would ttak.; out « ense against Agent Edwards. He says that he thinks that the defalcations of Edwards will amount to $12,000 or more when all is known. He has found witnesses to each of the four charges which he has raked up against Edwards and says that they are not only wise men but men "who will not tell a lie." The momentuous document which he has ready to send to Washington is as follows: First Count. Comes now H. C. Clark, and com plains and accuses O. C. Edwards, su perintendent and special disbursement agent of the Umatilla Indian reserva tion, in Oregon. That in the fall of 1906 with unjust ly and illegally charging and receiv ing fees far in excess of those pre scribed by the rules and regulations of the Indian department for live stock crossing said reservation. That during the season of 1906 of impounding cattle and refusing the right to the owners of the right of searching therefor and holding the same after they had been demanded upon the pretext of sending to Wash ington, D. C, for instruction and di rection of disposing of said cattle. That after leases had been executed and properly acknowledged before him as superintendent and special d.sburs ing agent of the Umatilla Indian res ervation of Oregon, by the Indian and white lessor, of refusing to forward the same to the Indian department at Washington, D. C, for approval and further refusing to return them to the white lessor upon demand therefor. That of practicng deception upon white lessors, in this, of agreeing with the white tenant and Indian allottee for a lease for two years and accepting rents therefor and thereafter and after the white lessor has summer fallowed said lands of ejecting him therefrom without notice.
