Mr. Wray GIIONS COUNTY RECORD RV O. R. STREETER. Linton, North Dakota. PIONEER PAPER OF THE COUNTY. Tt»-Kecnrd l* entered at the Ltntne Poet* olDe* Mc«ind*claaa The bellicose cuss up at Hazelton who is sloshing around in the col umns of the Republican, and looking for a scrap right away quick, refers to the Record chap as the author of the "liable" bill! Wuh! And dic tionaries selling as low as two-bits apiece! He also makes us the "he ro" of a "new" story—that was first told by Shem to Ham when they were feeding their dad's animals in the ark, and later repeated at a coon show in Linton a couple of years ago. There certainly must be an up-to-date bunch over in the Sar gent county jungles. A federal regulation which goes into effect January 1st prohibits ex press companies from taking inter state shipments of liquors unless they have been paid for or unless the customer has an account with the house. In other words, it does away with the C. O. D. business, and it is also provided that the goods must be consigned to a bona-fide purchaser. Another feature of the matter which will apply with special reference to North Dakota is a rul ing of the pure-food law in force in this state, which provides that all packages containing intoxicating liquors shall be so marked on the outside, and shall also describe the contents and the amount. Such packages as are not properly marked are liable to confiscation. Representative Knut Knutson, of the 56th Minnesota senatorial dis trict, comprising the counties of Swift and Big Stone, was in Linton yesterday on business. The editor had an opportunity to compare notes with Mr. Knutson as to prohibition matters in the two states. The lat ter was one of the minority that ad vocated county option from a prohi bition standpoint in the Minnesota legislature. The writer found from the gentleman's statements that the prohibitionists in that state are ad vocating county option on identical ly the same grounds that the resub missionists in North Dakota advance: that the state unit is entirely too large, with its varied population, to allow of a uniform, state-wide law working as smoothly in one part as it does in another. What we call "resubmission" in this state is not general license by any means,but the adoption of a system by which each county may regulate or taboo the traffic in intoxicating liquoro.accord ing to the scheme which may seem best to its citizens. And this is identically the system for which the prohibitionists in Minnesota areask ing. The message of President Taft was delivered to the congress last Monday. Although conservative in character, it is clear and to the point in the matters it refers to. Following is a synopsis of its prin cipal points: Urges a law forbidding injunction without notice to person or persons sought to be enjoined. Says the government is carrying newspapers and magazines at a loss in the mails, and urges congress to consider the matter. Urges the establishment of postal savings banks. Urges a ship-subsidy bill. Recommends that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as separate states. to all Says that he will send in a special message touching on the conserva tion of national reources and the anti-trust and inter-state commerce laws. Requests additional legislation for the suppression of the "white slave" trade. Asks authority to unite bureaus of manufactures and statistics. Asks for the establishment of a bureau of public health. Asks for permission to appoint a commission to consider holding an exposition to mark the fiftieth an niversary of the emancipation proc lamation. Asks congress to improve unsani tary conditions in workhouse and jail in the District of Columbia, a request which Roosevelt urged iii a special message. Urges commission to study away to expedite legal procedure. Tells of changes that have been made and will be made in navy de partment. Says Zelaya government in Nica ragua has been guilty of "unspeak­ uicier'a ll^kery und He« Aitiu of "^^££$5 

CHRISTMAS PRESENTS: able barbarities and oppression." That at the order of President Zela ya himself two Americans reported to be "entitled to be dealt with as prisoners of war" were puttodeath, and says the government is now de termining the truth concerning these outrages and the course to pursue. Gives information concerning the desired changes in the war depart ment methods, and asks that con gress make such changes. Explains the great importance of the new tariff commission which is to make a thorough investigation of matters pertaining to the tariff, so that action on tariff legislation may be intelligently taken by congress. Gives an account of the sugar trust's custom-house frauds. Says that the estimates of govern ment expenditures for the coming year have been "cut to the quick," and urges congress not to anticipate the revenues, that such expendi tures may be still further reduced. Urges the plan of pensions for aged government employees. Gives a short resume of relations existing between the United States and foreign countries. Asks that the United States be represented at the world's fair to be held at Brussels, Belgium, in 1910. Plain aad Trathtal Wonl*. Some people have either never vis ited North Dakota and have a much mistaken idea of the climate of the state, says the Medina Citizen, or else there is a big bunch of liars in other parts of the country who take deilght in firing shots at one of the best states in the Union—in fact, we might say the best. Some people still seem to live under the mistaken idea that this state is about the last place before reaching the north pole, and that there is nothing here but a sort of glacial formation. Wouldn't such ideas cause a person to "throw rocks at his mother-in law?" We were reading the other day—before we had had any cold weather whatever except a few days in October, and only a sprinkle of snow that soon melted—in a a paper published at Stanfield, Ore gon, that North Dakota had been visited by blizzards during the month named, and that the weather had been around fifteen degrees be low zero! Now, what do you think of that? Such publications as this Oregon paper are very ignorant or else they would take all the cake as prevaricators. The fall of 1909 in this state was ideal. We had some cool weather, cold enough to form thin ice but that is all. There were no blizzards in fact, there was no snow, which, with winds of a strong character, are the only com bination that can make a blizzard, and then the snow must be without a crust. It makes a person tired who has spent any length of time in North Dakota to read some articles pub lished in eastern and far-western papers concerning the climatic con ditions of this state. We acknow ledge we have cold weather, and we are glad of the fact. But it is a cold a person can stand—not a damp, wet cold that penetrates to the very bones, such as does the cold weather of some of the coast states and some of the states farther east and south. We have traveled and worked through practically every state west of the Mississippi, and, while each state has some features ahead of others, we have found none to com-' pare with North Dakota as an all-, around state, both in regard to climate and the earnjng capacity of its soil and people.' All we want any one to do is to give the state its just dues. But we would like to get them. North Dakota's people have more wealth per capita than any other state in the Union and the death rate, according to population, is the lowest. Two facts are worth re membering: that we are the health iest and the wealthiest state in the Union. If the newspapers of other states would confine themselves to facts about us it would be all right. But so many of the packages that are handed out to us are something fierce. A mine disaster in Pennsyl vania may kill a hundred men, with out casting reflections on the state a land-slide in Oregon may perform a similar feat, and nothing will be said of it a flood in the Ohio valley may cause the destruction of thou sands of dollars' worth of property and the loss of many lives, without a single word of comment, and an earthquake in California may de stroy an entire city and the state will still be considered in a favor able light.

The failure to aggravate aa existing trouble by bind inga moist application over an Inflam ed eye, which application Is supposed to remain for an entire night, can only be explained by the supposition that a guardian angel has watched over that misguided case and has displaced the poultice before it had got In Ita line work.
