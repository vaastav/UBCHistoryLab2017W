A Stingy Proposition. As far a? it has irono the suggestion for the extension of the hours of the govern-t meat clerk Is not coupled with any propo-i sition to grant him an increase in pay. i Apparently it is the expectation of those; who are proposing this measure of so-; called economy to require the clerk to work half an hour a day longer for the ! same compensation, an extension of his working time, or nearly seven per cent more labor, for the same money. This is the lias's of the last previous extension of the working hours of the department clerk, when thirty minutes was added to the day without any increase In sa ary. In short, the disposition prevails, it would reem, to regard the pay scale of the departments as something tlxed b^ ond ^ the possibility of amendment and the working day as something elastic without j limit. It Is to he borne in mind that the; present s. iary scale in the government1 departments was established over a gen- j rirtion ago. no changes whatever having I on made in over thirty years. There, ! avo been numerous additions to the list' vf li-.her salaried officers, but the pay of! th? l odv'of the workers remains pre-1 (isr-ly r.here it stood when the scale j was r?adjusted following the civil war. Meanwhile the working day has been extended not only once, but in some cases three times. The .government clerk is in class by hlmse f in this country, the only worker wVse hours have been extended systematically without any increase in compensation. In every line of industry and trade and business there has been a i instant tendency upward in the ware scale and a simultaneous tendency downward in the hours scale. All intelli-' rent emp'oyers recognize the fact that! the human machine is most productive! when it is properly rested, and it ie a| short-eighted user of labor indeed who1 thinks to increase the net result by driv-j - **1 ? r* 1 in? n s rorce vhiiuu: iiueguiiit luiupcu^a-i tion. Is the Un'ted States to stand thus eon-; spicuously apart from all other users of j human intelligence and skill and force?! It lias intrusted to the department clerks, an lntrica e, exacting and responsible j task. It is conducting perhaps the largest! business enterprise in the world, involv-i ing the annual disbursement of over u! billion dollars. If it Is now pressed tor; clerical service the expenditure necessary to bring the departmental forces up to the mark in point of numbers would be the most infinitesimal fraction of the whole amount expended In the course of a yeaf. " Every' other business Is constantly adding to its outlay for personal services In: proportion as It ?.rows. The United States! Is too rich, too prosperous, too progres-j slve to as!; Its emp oyes to contribute of their strength and lime and skill gratuitously, in order that it may squeeze * along and continue to do a growing business with a stationary force.

There can be no question of the truth *>f Secretary Wilson's assertion, conveyed through tlie medium of his annual report, :hat the middlemen are in large measure responsible for the maintenance of high prices. The fact Is the system of distributing the necessities of life is heavily ixpenslve. The consumer Is paying a arge tax for certain conveniences and liso for a process of retailing which has 10 economic warrant. In the nature of things the man who produces foods and ?ther articles of human need on *a large scale wishes to trade on a similar scale. He does not desire to become a retailer ind burden himself with the mechanism >f distribution. He will sell wherever possible to a wholesaler, a middleman, or to a etaller, delivering to one of these agencies perhaps the whole of his entire output. He is thus assured of his market with a minimum of cost and difficulty. At every stage of the progress of the product from source to use a percentage s added which the consumer ultimately MU* Whether It is possible for the consumers to buy directly in all cases from the prolacer is a question, but it is undoubtedly xtte that large gains could be made In (his direction. Only, however, througti I T organization can any appreciable benefit be obtained by the consumers. They must substitute for the distributing mechanism now in existence one of their own, with themselves as profit takers or profit sharers. Such enterprises have been attempted in practically all cities, with more or- less success. In some instances co-operative buying guilds and societies have been forced out of business through the opposition of the retail trade and the middlemen, the commission agents. Such a case was alleged in this city not long ago. The experience of that concern sufficed to show that when the citizen consumer undertakes to become his own wholesaler he must bring to his task the same business intelligence and shrewdness that the professional wholesaler or retailer applies to his undertaking. It may he that in some future state of society tills heavy economic waste of percentages taken by the various purveyors of necessities will be saved with the assistance of the state. It is a dream of the socialists of one grade for the government to supervise the distribution of all articles needed by the people. Against such a scheme is urged the proposition that the business of retailing the necessities affords employment to a great , army of people who, in a simpler state of afTairs, would be forced to seek other occupations. This simply means that the consumers are providing employment for a large section of society by submitting to a more expensive system of distribution ' than is actually necessary. It is plain that if the distance between the producer i and the user were shortened a serious 1 disturbance would result in industrial and i commercial lines. Would the condition of the consumer in such circumstances be i < improved? Would it be as good as before?!! Would not the turning of a multitude of| people now engaged' in self-supporting'1 work in the distribution of the necessities ] of life into other channels of occupation i aiTect the earning power of all? The Underwood Tariff Bill. Mr. Underwood, slated, as all believe, ' for the chairmanship of the next ways ' and means committee, has been expressing bis views on the tariff question. His ! district is a southern manufacturing center, afnl on that account many persons] have assumed that he must lean toward] protection. He denies tills, and speaks up for a tariff for revenue only. He ranges himself with those leaders of the democratic majority in the House who in the 1 past quarter century have dealt with tariff revision. It is to be said of those men that tiiey dealt with the subject without special regard to the interests of their own constituents. All subscribed to the same general proposition, though they found \ themselves unable to go as far as their \ professions and desires demandedCol. Morrison in the Forty-eighth Congress led off. He had been the moving spirit in tiie e-ectidn of Mr. Carlisle over Mr. Randall to the speakership, with anti-protection the issue. Still, there was a good deal of protection in the propositions Col. Morrison submitted to Congress. He found he could not eliminate it. or even tlx the date of its disappearance, by any manner of means. Mr. Mills, in the Fiftieth Congress, followed. His sympathies were wholly with the extreme recommendations Mr. Cleve?; 'and had made in the message of December, 18-S7, but the bill he reported and passed through the House in the follow-! ing spring carried man> shades of protection. He could not have pot'ed the democratic strength for such a measure as would have squared with his public speeches on the tariff. Mr. Springer's chairmanship was one of the fruits of the democratic landslide of 1SPO, which had oeen interpreted as a protest against the high protection of the McKinley law. But Mr. Springer stepped warily. Hft so-called "popgun" bills did not seriously threaten the citadels of; protection, hut made necessary another campaign on the tariff. , This campaign was fought in 1S02, and resulted in the election of both a democratic Congress and a democratic President. Mr. WTson of West Virginia was minie the leader of the House, and as such reported and passed a tarifT bill. But the measure was anything hut antiprotection, and was scored by many advocates outside Congress of a tariff forj revenue only Shall we not see the I'nderwood hill follow this same course? Mr. I'nderwood believes as Col. Morrison, Mr. Mills, Mr. Sponger and Mr. Wilson believed; but, as they did. he wili find it impossible toj put anything approaching his fulU belief into a tarifT measure which must encounter the fire of the House and country for several months. The only ques-' tion relates to how much protection the' uew bill will carry. The Diplomatic Service. Pnrun-fu imnnrt *?nt fhanc^a in the diplomatic service may or may not materialize. It Is not a subject for excitement. We have capable men on duty at the more important posts, and also many capable men ai home if they should be needed. Our foreign relations, as the President has Just advised the country, are at present in most satisfactory condition, and nothing threatens a stir anywhere. Our old friends among the powers are stronger friends than ever, and the new ones are progressing. Even the man who says the country sulTers from too much legislation always ! has a few new ideas that he would like i to see placed on the statute books. j There is a very positive disposition : manifest to make river and i.arbors ltg! islation look less like a Christmas tree > distribution. | The wintry conditions that make it impossible to aviate should be welcomed by the fcirdmen as a sort of closed season.

A committee of state legislators is now I sitting in New York to investigate cer1 tain charges of graft in connection with j recent efforts by the race track interests to secure enactments permitting the resumption of track gambling. It is to befeared that public confidence in this com j mittee will be weakened by a disclosure ! just made affecting the chairman himself, who in private life is engaged in the business of quarrying a certain red sandstone. A new stale prison is to be erected at Wingdale. Dutchess county. Bids have been invited for the furnishing of the materials. and quarrymen of both New York ?| ?tate and elsewhere are now complaining j that the specifications require that the stone shall be "Pottsdam red saudstonc i or its equal." "'They aver that inasmuch as the legislator who is sitting at the ' head of the graft committee is the owner i of this Pottsdam red sandstone quarry i the writing of the specifications In these terms virtually amounts to the award or the contract to him in advance, tor only the architect, whose selection has been challenged as due to political Influences, is to decide whether any submitied stone 1 is the equal of that particularly named. The assemblyman in question indignantly denies that there was any intention to write the specifications so as to favor him, and makes use of the following perfectly obvious expressions in an interview: "As a matter of fact, if I were not in politics uobouy wouid question this. i am in the quarry business to sell stone. I have sold it to the state before, and if the state is satisfied and wants to buy some more I don't see any reason why 1 should not sell again." 1 tint ' There Is no reason wny iic ??vw sell and no reason why the state should not buy. But there Is a reason, doubtless perfectly understood by him and by every other man in public life and in private business, why the state, of which he is an important officer, should not buy his product in circumstances that remler competition impossible. It would seem as though his membership on a conimlttce that is hunting out a big graft would have induced him to forego all participation in a contract in circumstances that strongly savor of a graft just as vicious, though perhaps not as large. Cleveland and Wilson. Is Woodrow Wilson of the Grover Cleveland order? Many democrats have been sighing for another Cleveland?a man who would speak his mihd and fight the politicians. Will they find him in the new leader in Jersey? Shall we see Mr. Wilson take as ready a stand- on all delicate matters as he has just taken on the senatorial matter? Mr. Cleveland's pronouncement -against the senatorial ambition of Edward Murphy, jr., is not entirely on all fours with that of Mr. Wilson on the senatorial ambition of James Smith, jr. Mr. Murphy bad not favored the nomination of Mr. Cleveland for President In tW?2. He was a Hjll man. But he accepted the result at Chicago, and returned home and was an active force in carrying New York for the ticket. Hence when Mr, Cleveland took a stand against Mr. Murphy he was accused of ingratitude along with the charge that he was assuming a good deal to speak at all on the subject. ,Mr. Smith was probably the most influential politician in New Jersey supporting Mr. Wilson's gubernatorial ambition, both before and after the nom [nation. It may not be too much to say that without Mr. Smith's assistance Mr. Wilson would never have been called from t^e academic shades of Princeton. Reform, it is true, was in the air, but a political organization was necessary to give it practical expression, and Mr. Smith was the master of the only democratic organization of statewide importance, and lie put it entirely at Mr. Wilson's service. It will be seen, therefore, that the charge of ingratitude is going to be more vigorously made against Mr. Wilson than it w'as against Mr. Cleveland. Did he not know that Mr. Smith wanted to be senator, and in case of the election of a democratic legislature would ask for the office? It was current talk, and not in the least silenced by the refusal of*Mr. Smith to submit his name for an expression from the people at the primaries. The Smith men smiled audibly at the candidacy of Mr. Martine, and declared that the result of the primaries would not "go" with the legislature, which would act without regard to it. Still, the fact remains that Mr. Wilson and Mr. Smith are not as politicians in the same clasif. The one is a man of education and ideals, and should make an excellent Governor of New Jersey. The other is a shrewd, practical politician, a master of caucus work, and no more. He has served a term in the Senate without disclosing qualifications for the place, and has not increased in stature since ills retirement. Perkins. The announced object of George W. Perkins in retiring from the firm of j. P. Morgan & Co. is of general interest. He is a capable man of business, reared in the attposphere of big things, and with personal credit attaching to one who lias done Dig tilings, w nat ne is now to attempt, however. Is very much bigger than anything, or all the things, he has over accomplished. His work will be watched with sympathy, and, if successful* it will prove of verygreat value. i The President's message was at a certain disadvantage in being obliged to compete for attention with Christmas shopping responsibilities. * ??r 1 "' - " The trouble with the "wait-for-a-thaw" method of street cleaning is that another snow usually arrives before it can be carried out. 1 1 ') > Any reduction in the cost of gas will naturally require the O.

THE FUR HARKi / BY WILLIAM E Written for The Star and th Next to the making of books the dress- 1 f ing of furs Is the most important industry e in Leipzig, and employs | ' Important the t me of several thou- a t_j_ i sand . people in the city . c industry. antl the neighboring vil-1f lages. They have been engaged in this | ? occupation for centuries, the secrets of jdyeing and dressing having been handed down from generation to generation in t the same families, improving with time, * so that today some of the Leipzig fur ^ dressers are able to convert the skins of t the most ignohie animals into rare and aristocratic furs. They sometimes work j miracles. They make sable out of wood- J chuck, ermine out of rabbit and cat skins, i and seal from nutria, and nobody knows j the difference. The results would even deceive the animals themselves. Millions of rabbit and cat skins come to Leipzig, but none ever go out. When they are shipped they are ermine, with little cony tails sewed on, and their value has been multiplied twenty times or more. London and Leipzig are the two great fur markets, but their business is conducted in a very different manner. In London all furs are sold at auction, and They come in from ail directions, both finished and unfinished. At Leipzig all the ! furs come in raw from the original i sources of supply and are redressed, dyed. j matched and put into shape for the! : manufacturer between the two fairs! which are held at Easter and Michaelmas ?in March and September. They are ail handled by commission houses, and Jobbers and buyers come from all over the ! ? world?often from the very places the furs come from?to make their selections and ship them home.The volume of busmess amounts to between twenty-five and thirty millions of dollars at each fair. The shipments of i furs to the 1'nited States alone in the '{ fiscal year of 1910 were valued at $6,977.- , 113. a gain of $2,287,610 over the year 1900. These were all dressed, .dyed and 1 matched: finished furs ready'to be made s up into wraps, muffs, boas and trimmings, j At the same time furs and skins valued f at $6 722.854 came from tlie United States ( to Leipzig in a raw state to be treated ' for the market. 1 ? t * * I The largest source of furs in the world ? is Silipria. Sable, fox skins of several j varieties, squirrel, mink, Siberian lynx, marten and- -other 1 ? varieties come principally J Supplies. fri,in that quarter. The ' next largest source of supply Is Alaska ^ and the shipments are bandied entirely j by Americans. Very few seal skins \ l come to Leipzig; they all go to London, ! J but everything else comes here, and sev- < eral large American firms have their offices in the Bruhl. 1 have met represent- j 1 Mtiven of New York. Chicago and De- j ] troit houses, who tell me surprising j j stories about rlie number of furs that j ] come from the United States. < Our central and southern states furnish ! Ti?nv wnodrhuck and mu?krnt skins. ] which are made over into sable: skunk skins, which are verv hiebly prized for ' stoles and muffs in France and (termany; otters, which are used chiefly for collar 1 and other trimming: opossums and squir- j reis, to he made into cloaks, coats and j ] trimmings, nud rabbits, which are turned j into ermine. From Alaska is derived the tamest sun- j j *dy of bear, beaver, red and silver gray 1 fox. lynx, marten, mink, otter, wolf and J wolverine skins; from South America come the nutr'a. which is a cheap sort or seal, chlm-hi'la and beaver skins- from Asia chiefly Persian lamb skins, or caraculs, as they are called, and from Hungary and Germany and other European countries rabbit and cat skins. Agents of Leipzig fur dressers are al ways traveling around nicking up skin* and shipping them in. Upon their arrival they are distributed among the dressers fn the city and in the neighboring villages. Bvesdorf, Uindeman, Schkenditz. ' Rostha and other places, where the larger oart of the population is encaged in the trade. There are specialists among the dressers. Some of them are skillful in handling certain furs; hence the sables are sent to one family, Persian lamb skins are sent to another, fox skins to another, and so on, according to their reputation. a ' * * After the skins are dressed and dyed; they are trimmed, matched, made upj into packages and stored toj Annua] await the mesein, or fair, when i n 2.500 or 3,COO 'buyers from all! r&ir. parts Gf |],e wor]ti will come to j I/dpzig to obtain their annual supply.] These messins, which, as I have said, ! occur immediately after Easter and Mi- j c-haelmas, are managed by an associa- , tion. which has headquarters, with a | corps of cjerks, whfre all trades are re- | corded and are practically guaranteed. No buverw are deceived. An imitation is sold for an imitation, and if the buyer chooses to deceive his customers at home it is his own business. He kno#s exactly what he is getting, and although lie pays a higher price for a sable skin that has been converted from a woodchuck than he would for the original woodchuck. the difference represents the time and labor and skill of the dresser. Every trade has its own nomenclature, and fur dealers know the meaning of the names that are applied in the market to different furs. Nobody can accuse the Leipzig dressers or dcaiers of deception. Everything they offer for sale is marked for exactly what It is. Each of the trades for which Leipzig is "ceii brated has its own location. The book manufacturers are in one part of the city, the ftiusic printers in another. the lithographers in another, and the fur dealers are in the oldest part of the town, call d the Bruhl. where almost every house is covered with signs of wholesale dealers, jobbers and com- ' i mission men, and the windows are tilled ' ' with exhibits of different kinds and eiuali- J ties of furs.

On ertain days of the week the auctions are leld and the goods are bought by samile upon guarantees by the auctioneer. In Leipzig there are no auctions. Everyhing is sold at private sale and the aucions in London are held at different times <t the year so that customers may go to >oth places without missing any oppor- j unities. There has been a derided advance in the trices of all kinds of furs, but most of I he money goes to the middleman and i nanufacturers. The Siberian hunters j md trappers have recently made an apical to the government through their communal village associations and the hambers of commerce for protection igainst the small buyers and commission nen who send their agents around hrough the villages to pick up the skins nat are brought in aur.ng ine season, i They have read in the newspapers and in ! >tiier ways have heard about the enornous advances that have been made in ha finished product. For example, in 000 sables were sold to wholesale buyers >y middlemen at the fair at Yakutsk at '"{.61 each, while in 1909 they were sellng at $82.50 each. In 1900 squirrel skins vere selling at 10 cents each, while in 909 they sold at 49 cents each, yet the lunters and trappers who brought them n received no more than formerly. # & The hunters and trappers in Alaska ind British Columbia, however, have done, much better. The Alaskan prices they receive are p. much higher than they XT1C6S. were a few years ago, tnd have practically kept pace with the | ulvanees in the wholesale and retail markets. For example, red fox skins which :hey sold for $2.40 each In 1901 are now selling for $7.75; silver gray foxes which hey sold for $111 each are now selling for $156; lynx skins which they sold for ?4.45 ten years ago are now $30 each; Tilnk skins which were bringing only $1 ;ach to the trapper are now paying him PS; muskrat skins which were 50 cents ?ach are now $2.50, and others in proportion. But when these skins get to market fhere is a big jump in price which is not justified by the cost of dressing and. hanHing. For example, a set of lynx skins which brought the trapper perhaps $50 or sold at retail for ten times that honey, and a silver fox. for which he ?ets $156 Is worth $1,000 A coat of huskrat skins, which are worth $3 or 14 each at wholesale, will sell for $300 or &350, and other furs bring similar prices. The demand for* caracul, or Persian lamb skins, is so great that more than two million pieces, valued at $10,000,000, were shipped from Bokhara during the past year, and probably an equal number from other stations in Turkestan llong the Central Asia railway. There is no way to get the actual statistics, but it s entirely proba,ble that the lamb crop of furkestan brought $25,000,000 into that country during the last year. These skins are brought into market unmatched in bunches of ten and of different sizes, which sell in the khans for - ? ? - - i Hi.. F25 to ?ir>0 a Duncn, accoramg to quam-jr and condition. The smaller the skin the higher the price, and the skins of unborn lambs are the most expensive, as they should be, because they represent the sacrifice of the mother sheep as well as her offspring. * * SThe demand of fashion for lamb skins has pushed prices up very rapidly. They used to sell for $1 a skin, reLamb gardless of quality, and $2 . was considered an excessive oKins. prj00 Today you cannot buy anything for less than $2.ob, while the ordinary price is $5 a skin. The demand for wraps, muffs, coats, cuffs, collars and trimmings is the largest from Russia, then from England, and next the United States. The coarser qualities, used for linings, are not often sent to Leipzig to be dressed. Indeed, very few of the lamb skins used in Russia ever see Leipzig. There is a large local demand for coats and fezes, which are worn all over Turkestan. Persia and the Caucasus. A Caucasus dandy wiH pay $."?0 or $100 for an especially fine shako made of lambskin. The skins come in from the ranches and villages? tied up in bundles of ten. They are then packed in bales containing 200 pieces, and are shipped by rail to Moscow and Nizhni Novgorod, where they are sold to agents of Leipzig commission houses, who are not allowed to go Into Turkestan, their source of supply. That is a clos-d country, a military despotism, where none but Russian merchants are allowed to trade. All the skins Intended for the English, continental and American markets are sent to Leipzig to be rtdressed. trimmed, combed and curled, and in one of the suburban villages are families so skillful in that eort of work that .you would not know a skin after it had been through their hands. The curling of the wool requires a special knack, which Is possessed to a' high degree by several families in that particular village. They have been doing it for generations, and nobody can do it any better. Their dressing quadruples the value of a skin, although their pay is comparatively small. The commission man enjoys the biggest part of the*protit.

FIFTY YEARS AGO , 1 IN THE STAR til Congress assembled on Monday. Decern- (J ber 3, lSUu, and President Buchanan transmitted his annual message President's the next day. The Star gt HIT said in its issue of De- tjaessage. cember 4, regarding the message j n, "The reading of the President's annual mrs-age created an intense sensation to-" j day in the House, which never before locked so like what it was designed for, a deliberative ussembly. Every member was apparently in his seat, listening with cf dignity, decorum and breithless attention. S1 The galleries, too. fairly caught the inftction. it was a glorious sight indeed, tl One might have almost dreamed that the el lathers of the republic again occupied for th the ponce the high places that now 111 know them no more. The portion treat- dl ing of secession formed the topic of in- a: tense Interest. It proved to be what might have been expected from President tl Buchanan's public history and the well w known views upon the point in issue, si While showing that the Union Is already b practically dismembered by an effort of g South Carolina to secede, he disproves the g soundness of the pleas upon which the p right of secession is based, showing that 0 it is naked revolution and nothing else, At the same time he demonstrates with p equal force the utter impolicy of attempt- ic ing to cure the difficulty by measures of o coercion. He pledges himself to the exe- ri cution of the laws by the exercise of all the powers of the government really at his command, and shows that without prompt action by Congress those powers s will be ot' no avatl in the emergency. The n message is destined to form a landmark tl in the history of American public affairs; q insomuch as it will at once become the ji platform upon which all conservative and c really Union-loving men of the land must s necessarily, as they will gladly, rally in ^ this most momentous contest in which our country ever became involved." t ii o A practical question immediately arose p as to the best method of treating the I questions raised by the SeC S8ion President's message. In * T,ie Star of December 5, ? Committee. thc foIlowlng waa * printed: I "It is understood that Speaker Penning- ^ ton avows the determination to compose the committee of one from each state, ordered by thc House yesterday, altogether of conservative members, of gen- 1 tlemen earnestly anxious for a settlement of the current threatening troubles within ' the Union. This is as it should be. If so appointed the committee may accomplish something toward inducing Alabama, c Mississippi and Georgia to pause ere de- h termining to sacrifice the Unicn without a 1 serious and sincere effort to preserve the t ?r 1> -?sai ..i * * - -a * iiguia vi inc ftuum Hiiuuui uic aesiruction of the many incOinpaable blessings which the whole confederacy undeniably enjoy under the existing government, but hardly otherwise." The committee was named the following day, the announcement being carried by The Star of December 6. The following members of the House were selected by the Speaker to consider that part of the President's message treating of secession: Corwin of Ohio, Millson of Virginia, Adams of Massachusetts, Winslow of North Carolina, Humphrey of New York, Boyce of South Carolina, Campbell of Pennsylvania, Love of Georgia, Ferry of , Connecticut, Davis of Maryland, Robinson of Rhode Island, Wh'.tely of Delaware, Tappan of New Hampshire.

In The Star of December 8, 1SG0, is the folloWSouthern paragraph: _. "The South Carolina DlSCOFd. legislature is at loggerheads about the matter of officering the new army to be raiasd in that state. The democracy of the rural districts is waging fierce war against the domineering autocracy of Charleston, which clique is fighting for a monarchical form of gov- 1 ernment, and entertains a purpose to make the governor of the state a military ] chieftain with sovereign power. Mr. Cunningham of the house, who is put forward by the committee to take all the reunnneihilitv llf UTtrpmn KMltlmcrlK llHK 1 openly avowed his hatred of democracy 1 in the camp. He considered the common 1 soldier as incapable of an elective choice. 1 The opposing or thoroughly democratic j party of the house, while avowing strong , : secession sentiments, are nevertheless bit- , | ter stick ers for popular rights and will ! stand out for them. As yet they have ' [ been able to obtain few concessions. They have caused the army bill now under con- \ ! sideration to be modified to such an ex- , tent that the govei nor shall appoint gen- , eral and Held officers by and with the auvice and consent of the senate. The uebate in the South Carolina house of rep- e resentatives Tuesday last was bitterly t acrimonious." r mmm. t THE

Goutchkof is octobrist and was elected >y 201 votes of the octobrists against 137 rotes of the nationalists. a * a It should be recalled that the octoirists occupy in the center of the duma a middle situation between )ctobrists' the conservative monarch_ ... ists and the constitutionalposition. lsts cf the ,eft The in. nmnatlhilltv of the tendencies professed y these two gregt groups renders illusory lie conciliatory role which the center ocobrists proposed to play. This center is itself solidified in two lirections diametrically oppt sed. It sufers from a chronic disassociation. which letaclied frcm it a subsection of the ocobrists of the right, which encourage the xrtobrists of the left to rebel against >arty discipline. Octobrlsm does not possess a desirable cohesion and is nomercally weak. The total effective vote, iniucflng the 10 octobrists of the right. j s 1X5 votes, a little less than one-third j >f the duina, since the assembly num- j >ers 441 members.

It results from the foregoing figures hat the octobrists cannot constitute a najorlty except in forming "bloc" with the nationalists, that is. with a part of :lie l'ight. That majority is formed in ill important circumstances of parliamentary action. Nevertheless the existence is subordinate to mutual consent, which requires each time new deliberations. It is always temporary and coalitional.

The re-election of M.

In vain it interview, j,as been answered: "These interviews are simply recurring xchanpe of visits which may or may lot have political importance." The interview at Bjorkoe in 15S03, Swinemunde n 1907, Friedrichsham in 1909 had no special importance. Nevertheless there svere serious questions which had arisen with relation to Turkey, and above all to Persia. A Berlin correspondent, according to J the Novoe Vremya, had a conversation with M. Sasonoff the Russian minister of foreign affairs. The correspondent reports M. Tasonofr . is saying that Germany bad agree i not o .sustain Turkey militarily either in E'i- : ope or in Asia if Turkey troubled the 1 leace. This was one of the positive reu ts of the interview. M. Charmes In his chronic in the tevue des Deux Mondes does not think i he interview of much value. "The press ' eeks the secret and there is perhaps no ! ecret." He says that M. TasonofT Is not t inly a wise man. but a well known d>p- I omat.
