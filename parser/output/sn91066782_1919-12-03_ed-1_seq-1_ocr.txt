MAY CUT OFF TRAINS TO CONSERVE COAL Many More Industrial Concerns Face Shutdown as Result of Contin ued Coal Strike. Chicago, Dee. 3. Further disruption of national industry because of the fuel shortage brought about by the strike of bituminous coal miners was in pros pect to-day. Regional directors of rail roads had authority to annul passen ger trains where the public would be least inconvenienced and many addi tional manufacturing plants through out the country faced shutdowns ei ther through exhaustion of their coal supplies or the strict regulation re quired by the federal fuel adminis trator. State executives who, under appeals from their constituents for aid, have sought ways and means for replenish ing the dwindling fuel supply to-day virtually were without encouragement as regards increased production. Only in isolated instances were there reports of a change of front on the part of the miners. Generally the workers ad hered to their attitude of remaining away from the mines until better terms than the 14 per cent, wage increase de creed by the government were forth coming.. Optimistic reports were received from operators of the district embracing southern Kentucky, Tennessee and Vir ginia that, the backbone of the strike there had been broken.

Washington, D. C, Dee, 3. President Wilson will not begin preparation of his special message to Congress on the railroad situation until Director Gen eral Hines has conferred with Senator Cummins and Representative Esch, chairman of the Senate and House in terstate commerce committees, on the pending railroad bills, it was said to day at the White House. It was intimated that the status of the legislation might be such that the president would not regard it as neces sary to address Congress on the sub ject. Leaders in Congress are deter mined to press the bills, but they have expressed doubt that their enactment could le completed before the Christ mas holiday.
