The New York Independent lays out for Congress iti work for the winter, and among the jobi which it would have done at once, it mention the following: Wo hope the lloiisa of Itapreseutatives will promptly prepare articles of impeach roent airninat the Supreme Court of thn United Slates, including in whole bench of judges, all and singular, for diiobedience to tba Uiril itightl Mill. Ul course, when we ay impeach men t, we mean tha mild pro- cei of moral indignation, rather than the toerce alternative of criminal proucution. Tba thirteenth rale of aba Sokrwme Ooort is as follows: ''The aerricn ( all aubpirnaa thall be by a delivery of a vopjr thtirnof by tne uthcur terving the iituie to the deiend ant poraoually, or io cuae of huaband and rile, to the buiband peraonallr, or by tear ing a copy thereof at the dwelling-bouie or uaual place ot abode ol each defendant, with tome free white pertun, who i a mem bar or resident io the family." Thi rule.be it remembered, n a rule of the court over which Salmon Portland Chaae, of ami slav ery memory, daily presides! iha unsettled condition of the South, the continuous persecutions of the Negro, the ostracism of Northern settlers, the continued rebelliousness of many former rebola all this requires the serious and stern attention of Congress. We say it requires the atten tion of Congress, not forgetting that it is the duty of a 1 resident who Las said "Let have peace ' to keep the peace. We hav uttered few criticisms upon the admitiistra tion of l'reaidoot Grant. It has seemed us that from the bpsinning of his term has been animated by a patriotic- desire to do justice to the uetrro. Certainly, he has signally proven bis willingness to see the wronged race righted. He not only urged in his inaugural the speedy passage of the r tfteenth Amendment, but lie immediately beean to appoint colored men to responsible omces under the Uovernment. Only two criticisms do we care to urge against our well meaning Chief Magistrate: one of which is that be has not alwnvs been ao happy the selection of his white as of his black as sociates in the Government; and the other is that he has failed to make the negro's life safe on the Southern plantations. If the President answers, "I have done my best,' then let Congress devise a way of doing bet ter. I he need of interposition in the ne gro's behalf was never greater than now. Fnsumatio Train Braks. Reference has already been made to the contemplated testing of a new train brake, invented by George Westioghaui Jr., of Pittsburgh. An experimental trip has been made on the Chicago L Northwestern road and the new brake thoroughly and satis factonly tested in the presence of a large number of experienced railroad officers and practical machinists. The Chicago Railway Review gives the subjoined account of the experiment : The train was twice slopped with the party on board, and all were astonished that o sudden a stop under bigo speed could be made witbout perceptible jar or jerking, or other inconvenience to the passengers. Its motion, due to the application of the pow er equally and contemporaneously to all the rbeels ot all too cars, can be com pared to nothing more suggestive than the motion of a "swing" approaching the ex tremity of its arc. Having disombarked,tbe party witnessed two applications of the brake, the train moving m the first instance about 32 miles, and in the second instance (having backed two miles) more than 40 miles per hour. The first time it was stop ped in 19 seconds, in a distance only 60 feet greater thun its own length The second time it came to rest in 18 seconds, in a dis tance 50 feer more than its length. Con taining only six day cars, the train was considerably shorter than arc most of our express trains with their baggage and long palace cars. J he apparatus is, as before described, rholly under the control of the engineer. and is applied by a motion similar to that by which a valve is opened; bnt, though operating solely from the engine, and dis pensing with the service of brakemen, it rorks in connection with tb band Drake, it these are retained. In the present instance the entir apparatus is the same that has been in use daily for several months, on a train making no fewer than 100 stops per dav. John G Saxe, at a Western hotel, the other day, for some minutes undertook in vain to carve a piece of beef. The wit laid down knife and fork, glanced around and spoke: "Gentlemen," said he, "that's an infringement on Goodyear's patent." Tha General Assembly of Kentucky met yesterday, and elected P. H. Leslie, of Bar ron county, President. J he uovernor s message was then read. He takes a cheerful tiew of the existing condition ef atTairs in the State, and makes some important recom mendations. A New York dispatch, says: ''The stock and gold market were buoyant, but when the President's Message became known there was a reaction, especially on account of his views about specie payments. The stock market became dull aud drepreseed, and there was a decline in gold, which rallied af terward, but closed heavily. The greatest activity was in Government bonds, which advanced, under favorable news from Lon don, bnt subsequently fell off." The Montgomery (Ala.) Mail of Novem ber 16, bas the following paragraph : "The Legislature convened yesterday noon in re gular session, at 12 o'cloek. All the thieves, penitentiary convicts, Yankee bummers, bigamists, barbers and shoemakers were in their seats. Had there not been present core of true Alabamians, in the shape of the little band of Democrats, the concern might have been mistaken for a lunatic asylum or a penitentiary. The Assembly may be generally characterized as low browed and empty pocketed, tt i sugges tive of wharf-rats, plug-uglies and snewi thieves.

The idea is to have the eleo lions take place in all the Mates ou the same day. The bill fixes thn first Tues day in November, 1M7'.', as the time when the law shall take ellect. J. be committee appointed Messrs. Stevenson, Uurdette and Kerr as a sub comuiitte to examine the Louisiana election cases. It is expected that the nominations for the nine United States District Judges, and a Jndge of the Supreme Court, will be sent to the Senate to morrow. Mr Blatcbford, implicated in the draw back frauds at the New York Custom House, promises to make a full confession to Judge rierrepont. lie says be will involve some of the must prominent merchants and politician oi icw i or. U. W. Dent, brother-in-law of the J'resi dent is here applying for 'bo olric ol tur- ever of tho Port of San Fraucisco. Dent claims to bo a resident of Calilornia. District Attorney Pierrepoint, of New York who is now here, says there is no test mony in his possession to warreot the deten tion of the Spanish gunboats. He has repeatedly called upon the Peruvian Minister for evidence to sustain bis charges, but bas not recieved any. the case will come up in the United States Court at New York, on tho 10th. The first business in the House of Kfpre- senatives this morning was the distribution of the President's Message to the di 11V rent committees having charge of the matters of bich the Message treats. 1 he resolution was offered by Mr. Scheuck, with the content ol the committee on nays and Means, and some discussion ensued as to the proper committee to which certain subjects should be referred. 1 he reference of that portion of the Message relating to the Darien inter Oceanic Canal, particularly (excited discus sioti, the committee oi. Commerce, foreign Affairs and Navagation, all claiming it. The resolution proposed to leave it with the Com mittee on Commerce, and it was o left.

A letter received ast night from Havaua gives tha details of barbarisles practiced on negroes suspected of being engaged in the conspiracy to burn plantations near Sagua.
