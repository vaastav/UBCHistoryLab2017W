Dighton has six practicing phy sicians. Carlisle is the national house speaker. There are still 3,500 acres o school land unsold in Lane county, vocif erates the Ha aid. The wink of that Eye is more lively sinco the intended starting of a new Republican paper has been announced at Oberlin. Senator Sherman was elected president' 0 tan. of the national senate. Only Cleveland's form between him and the presidency. The Courier has heen shown a couple of counterfeit silver dollars, of a lot of some fifteen found on a farm not far from Beloit. Topeka is booming, the Capital claims That organ declares that on Thursday of last week more business was transacted in that city than on any pre vious da, except during holidays, in the history of the city. There seems to the Courier to -he scarcity of game in tho Beloit market That paper thinks tho combination of farmers to stop promiscuous shooting and hunting on their premises has much to do in preventing tho wholesale slaughter of quails and paririe chickens. It is claimed that those in au thority declare that tho U. P. railway company will, at an early date, build a branch line from Oakley, St. John county, to Colby, Thomas county. The Oakley Opinion roports surveyors at work on tho proposed line, and expresses tho belief that Colby will hear the snort of the iron horse this side of June. Frank Douglass and wife live at "Wacosta, Mich. The Beloit Couiier learns from Prank's brother, 'Gene, of Solomon Rapids, Mitchell county, this state, that Prank's infant was poisoned a short time ago by being gien a dose of "Rough on Rats" by a servant girl. Peo ple can hardly begin to Uncareful enough in guarding against tho danger of having preparations used out of tho wrong bottle. Lee, of the Lane County Herald is getting mixed up with the railway cor porations. We rather regret to see this. When he was poor like the rest of us he was a capital good fellow, but palace-car riding is apt to pnff people 'way up. That paper says: "A privato letter from the vico president of this (tho Wichita and Colorado) road to tho proprietor of the Herald states that tho road will bo built through Lane county and on west to Col orado." Our friend, Captain Charlesworth, of Beloit, is at home on a leave of absence. The Courier of last week has this to say of him: "Capfc. Charlesworth's lecture, descriptivo of the Maderia Island and Punchal, its capital, at tho rink, on Wednesday night of last week, was well received by a fair audience. His resi dence there as consul gave him excellent opportunity to study tho character of its people, and he portrays their customs very lucidly There is talk of A. a. McBride taking another move. Tho report is that ' he will go this tim3 from Kirwin to Ober lin for the purpose of starting a new pa per. Mc's orbit in journalism is eccen tric, but his brilliancy makes him -worth looking after anyway. His brother, W. H., the esteemed representative in tho legislature from Phillips county, seems to have an interest in the plant. It is un known, however, at these headquarters whether he will go to Oberlin. It is reported as one of the cur rent facts that tho Democrats are going to force tho attention of congress to the Ktz John Porter case this winter. It is more than passing strange that a body which elects Stalwart John Sherman its president by a decided majority contains a sufficient number of admirers of this traitor Porter to vote for his restoration to rank in the army. Thanks to the loy alty of the Northern people, General Lo gan is still on deck to do his duty in this case as a senator! TiiEQjaJioM just mounts its high horse and rides with the fury of a north ern blast, so to speak, because the Grin nell Golden Belt declared, or was supposed to have declared, that uutaken govern ment claims were plentiful within three miles of Oakley. The Opinion retorts: "The truth is, the public domain in a circle of seven or more miles around Oakley is taken solidly; not an acre of in anyway desirable land can be taken by virtue of the homestead, pre-emption, tftnbot culture or school-land laws." nrivi hi winntiiAsiank tmvifliBBir ii irvv jj.; BLf VTI I B m H B H Ifl e hfm V Vk V r 1 H39&f3SpK&i Bl ScLLmA flLLAM C -H BiLI fliLI tiiLA iLLm I LH I Hl THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. We appeal to the sense of the Western Kansas World readers as to whether we do not fill the bill in furnishing a complete weekly journal of news. Not one Kansas veekly in six will have the president's message this week. The World gives it to you in full, although not a daily paper in the country published it before Wednesday. We will drop the hint that this message, in all its ponderosity, did not come to us without our having made arrange ments looking to the certainty of its doing so. Considering the contents of the message, it is pronounced the lon gest doaument of the kind which has been sent out for a dozen years past. Perhaps, in point of literary quality, it is an average paper of the kind. For the present, the World will merely call attention to the position of the president on the Chinese question. Mr. Cleveland, we ven ture to assert, is sincere. He handles the question as the vexed problem that it is. At the same time, we be lieve that the president takes an ultra view in favor of the Chinaman. The writer claims to be informed, at least fairly, concerning the con dition of the Chinese in their main stamping ground, in San Francisco. In or close to the heart of that great commercial emporium, the Chinese have literally stunk the white people out of several blocks, and hold the buildings from several stories down in the ground to the top. The condition of the Chinese in these dark cellars beneath cellars is one of perpetual filth, darkness, opium smoking, unpunished murder and other crime. In many of the rooms there are two reliefs of sleep ers in the , God-forsaken cots, one relief rising in the middle of the night and tramping about from then till morning, while the other relief sleeps. These Chinamen undermine white labor by driving: it from the field or compelling the laborers to become as stinkingly depraved as the China men themselves. Furthermore, whatever money the Chinese save is sent back to China, instead of being used for the benefit of America. Of the general truth of these utterances, the position of the people of the Pacific coast on the Chinese question is convincing evidence. The Japan ese are welcomed in San Francisco by the whites. Why? They are scrupulously clean in their habits, take up American custdms and are courteous in their deportment. . Like the president, we deprecate such massacres of Chinamen as the recent one at Rock Springs was. But the state of things of which we have given a dim outline caused that massacre. Conservatism in dealing with this question is to be com mended; but too much conservatism persisted in on the part of the gen eral government will bring about, in the near future,the speedy destruc tion of every China man, woman and child in the Pacific coast states. Then the attempted seceding' of those states from .the general gov ernment will be the natural result of the interference of the latter. Business is stagnated in San Francisco. The whites attribute this condition to the Chinese. Thousands of men in that city are crying for the blood of the Chinese. On a recent Sunday we do not know how much oftener they met on the Sand Lots, and called on the county coroner, a man who is in debted largely to this class, to lead in an attack against the Chinese. The coroner is an agitator, but he refused to do this at this time. He persuaded them to wait. On this occasion, these thousands of men were armed. Congress and the president can modify the enormity of this wither ing curse on the Pacific coast. They have it in thr-ir pnwrr to provide stock: .lancinsra- tecs jbjlsis of ott:e& ustdttstk-iies- WArKEEKEY,
