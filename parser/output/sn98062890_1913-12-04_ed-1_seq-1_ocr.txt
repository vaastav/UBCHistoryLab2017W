"$S8 •x With no long recess during the summer, no holiday recess and a thirteen-hour day now thrust upon them, the U. S. senators may be com pelled to form a union to guard against overwork. There is some of warrior spirit in th« democratic secretary of the navy, who asks congress to authorize the the construction of two dreadnaughts eight destroyers and three submar ines each year. Even if worse comes to worst the senate will not have to go wholly without a holiday recess. It is given out that the managers of the currency bill will not oppose a recess lasting from 11 o'clock p. m., December 24, to 10 o'clock a. m., December 2(3. gs? The speeding up process on the cur rercy bill was launched in the senate Monday. The democrats are pledged by a gentlemen's agreement to sup port the bill completed by the caucus and to push the measure to its final passage before Christmas, if possible. January 18, 14 and 15 have been practically decided upon as the dates for the annual convention of the South Dakota Conservation congress, to be held in Sioux Falls. Some of the ablest men in the country will be present and make addresses on sub jects of great importance to the future development of the state. The postoffice department is hav ing difficulty securing a postmaster for the Yankton Indian agency. Dates have been fixed at two differ ent times for a civil examination to select a postmaster, but no applicants appeared at either of the hearings. A new date now has been fixed, Dec. 13. The office payB a salary of $460 a year. While the department of the inter ior has not yet announced the date for the opening to settlement of the unallotted portion of the Standing Bock reservation, the opening is ex pected to take place some time next year. The Indians have already made their selections, and there are about 600 tracts of land in the reservation that will be open to homestead entry when the department acts. In 1912 more forest fires were due to lightning than to any other cause railroads, campers and incendiaries following in the order named. About 88 per cent were due to carelessness. According to the Federal Forest Ser vice the average annual loss from forest fires is about 70 lives and $25, 000,000. If the cost of crops, build ings, stock and young trees were in? eluded the loss would be many mil lions more. The provision of the new tariff law that places raw wool on the free list went into operation Monday and on the first of January the provision placing manufactured woolen cloth on the free list will become of effect. There have been no symptoms of a decline in the price of wool as the market approached this change from protection to free trade and wool growers are not seriously concerned over the future value of their product from the operation of the tariff act. r^'

Egan vs. the Watertown Public Opinion Publishing Company, which has been on trial here for a week re turned into court this morning a ver dict in favor of Mr. Egan for ten thousand dollars. The delay in re turning the verdict was occasioned by the fact that several of the jury stood out for $25,000 for the plaintiff. The case arose out of publications made by the Watertown paper reflect ing on Mr. Egan's character during hiB campaign for governor in 1912. The charges were proven to be false and malicious. In fact all through the trial it was evident that Shere was only one question in the case, and that was—how much. All persons familiar with the poli tical situation in this state agree that it was calumnies, libels and false ac cusations which were sent broadcast during tbe last campaign that de feated Mr. Egan for the governorship. He made a great and gallant fight to reduce the burden of taxation and lower the expense of the state govern ment by reducing the number of state officers who live from the pay rolls of the state. The Byrne-Crawford faction repre- FOR CLOSED SEASON ON DEER Agitation among Black Hills hunt ers for a closed season of several .years on deer has started as a result of the ill luck of the numerous hunt ers in the hills this month. With the season almost closed, but thirty two deer have been bagged in the Black Hills this season, which is far under the usual number. In Law rence county alone there has been 280 licenses issued and only a dozen of them have resulted in killings. While it is true that there has been no snow in the Hills, and consequent ly the deer had better chances for es caping detection, the hunters all re port a great scarcity of the animals and believe that a closed season is necessary to replenish the number in the Hills. THE RAILROAD'S EXCUSE Philadelphia North American: The attitude of the forty-nine railroads that want higher freight rates is sum med up in exactly nineteen words: Everything else has gone up and the public would be conscience stricken if compelled to discriminate against the railroads. FILING JUDGE'S PETITIONS The secretary of state will hold on one phase of the Richard primiary act that the impossible will not be de manded of judicial candidates. One phase of the law provides for peti tion nominations for circuit judge, and provides that no petitions shall be signed prior to ninety days before the primary, with another provision that judicial petitions must be filed with the secretary not less than nine ty days before the primary. This, Mr. Richards says, was an error in in drafting, but it is there, and the secretary holds that he will accept petitions of candidates for circuit udge, even though the signing dates show that tbe signatures were secur ed more than ninety days before the election, so as to allow the candi dates to make their filings within tbe time limit. LAND FILINGS SETTLED George Roskie of the land commis sioners department has returned from a conference with officials at Washing ton, and has secured their agreement to approve the filings which South Da cota made some time ago upon lands in Mellette and Bennett counties. The department at Washington also promis ed to take up at once the matter of ap proval of the state's general indemnity filings on about 200,000 acres of land scattered over the state. EGAN'S GREAT VICTORY Geo. W. Egan, late candidate for governor, given the largest verdict ever rendered in a libel suit in the northwest—$10,000, was the final agreement, although many of the jury wanted to give more with four members hanging out for $25,000 for the brilliant iplaintiff whose management of his own case affirmed his reputation as the greatest jury lawyer in the west—verdict meets with popular approval. Jurors call on Mr. Egan and assure him of their friendship and sympathy in his great fight against a bunch of political enemies who have sought to destroy him, ever since he came to the state, and convicted Mrs. Kaufman of the murder of her servant girl, Agnes Polreis. 5" WV1 Ti 20, if •tsast sentihg the political machine, saw in him defeat in the great crowds that were hearing Mr. Egan and rallying to his support and as a last desperate effort to destroy him they filled these papers, tracts and pamphlets with false and malicious attacks on his personal character. Of course Mr. Egan could not stop to bring suits in the heat of the fight, as his enemies well know, and the poison had its effect. But notwithstanding this Mr. Egan made the greatest single-handed fight that perhaps was ever made. He increased his vote almost fifty per cent in the state. In 1910 he re ceived 21,000 votes against Vessey in 1912 he received nearly 80,000 votes against Byrne. Mr. Egan is more popular than ever with the people as they learn the things he has suffered and the fight he has made for the man who pays the taxes and bears the real burdens of life. Many are urging him to run either for governor or senator. He declines and says that the maligners of himself, his family and friends must be taken care of first. Mr. Egan is after those who attacked him and will not stop until they have either retracted or paid.— Watertown Special. PACKARD IS CANDIDATE H. P. Packard of Redfield, long prominent in republican politics in South Dakota, has announced his candidacy tor the republican nomin ation for lieutenant governor subject to the approval of the majority pro posal committee at the meeting at Pierre in January. This gives Red field three candidates, as N. P. Brom ley sometime ago announced his can didacy for the nomination for con gress, and T. S.

LAST BOAT DOWN RIVER What was the "last boat" of the season went down the Missouri, leav ing here Saturday in an effort to beat the ice to the open waters of the low er river. Tbe party, consisting of H. F. Tracy, Grant Tracy and L. J. Williams, of Grinell, N. D., are head ed for the gulf in a gasoline launch, 12 by 45 feet in sizr. They left their home drifting while they placed the engine, desiring to get down the river before caught in the ice. Their prog ress was slow until their engine was placed, after which they made about 100 miles a day. They laid up here for repairs and supplies and are again on their way to the southland, racing to beat the frost line to tb« i/twer river. Earl D.

MUST BE GOOD NOW An amendment to the Sherman act was yesterday introduced' in the house of representatives that seek to abolish fines for violation of tbe act and substitute jail sentences. The temper of pongreas renders possible its passage and should it become op erative the monopolists will take to tbe woods. Fines can be collected from tbe consumers, but there is no vicarious atonement in a Jail sentence. PROGRESSIVE IN ALL THINGS Huron Huronite: In hiB message to congress, President Wilson again and emphatically renews his sense of devo tion to the cause of the common peo ple. He may be called a democrat, having been educated to the tenets of that party, but his democracy is broad er than partyism. It considers man kind in general. He speaks in behalf of the progres sive thought of the nation, urging the overthrow of monopoly, "more effectu ally than it has yet been" overthrown, and promises a special message on that topic. He speaks for the reform of the cur rency, for a system of credits for the farmers of the country, that they may be placed on an equality with men in other lineB of business. He endorses and commends the efforts of the agri cultural department to improve the condition of soil tillers and of the treas ury department to furnish the means for moving their crops to market. He asks for legislation that will in stall a primary system for the nomina tion of candidates for the presidency without the intervention of conventions. He considers affirmatively the inde pendence of the Philippine islands atio a territorial form of government for Alaska, with the construction by the general government of a railroad that will open the Alaska country to civi lized development. He gives attention to the improve ment of labor conditions, with his in tentions well anchored in behalf of the wage earner. In ail his recommendations, President Wilson considers the welfare and the advancement of the masses, thus evinc ing full sympathy with the progressive thought elevated him to the chief magi stracy, He is fulfilling the expectations of those who came to his support at the last election and very many of them were not democrats. They were men of all parties who had gathered faith in him and have found in not misplaced. In giving prominence to Mexican troubles, the president recommends a waiting policy, which he says will cer tainly right the wrongs perpetrated in the name of government in-the revolt ed republic. Usurpation has brought militarism There is nothing stableJn the situation and the collapse of pre tense is shortly to assert itself. TO
