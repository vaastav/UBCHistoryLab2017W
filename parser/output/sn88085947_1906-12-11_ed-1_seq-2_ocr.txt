Entirely dismissing the possibility that those ,who are most familiar with the little brown niton of the Orient may be best fitted to judge of his characteristics, Mr. Roosevelt proceeds to flay the California authorities for enforcing their state laws in regard to Oriental schools. He accuses the people of the Pacific Coast of thought lessly, and through blind prejudice, attempting to embroil tlie United States in a war. Tn his eulogy of the Japanese and condemnation of the Californians he neglects to touch upon the facts, vouched for hy official reports, of condi tions in the Hawaiian Islands, where the American is be ing practically forced out of business and politics by these very good friends from Japan. There is no mention made of the fact that ex-officers of the Japanese army are arriving in Honolulu hy every boat. The evidences of a hostile spirit on the part of the subjects of the mikado are too familiar to the general public to require repetition. Mr. Roosevelt cites the re markable rise of the Japanese within the last century, and comments upon there unswerving loyalty to the mikado and Xippon. la the event of trouble with them it would appear that 'while this patriotism of theirs is a very nice thing in the abstract, it is just what wo have to fear in the concrete. Allowing that the Japanese be naturalized it will necessarily follow that lie will be permitted to serve in the army and navy. With several thousand trained Japanese fighters in his. own forces, what chance would Caucasian Uncle Sam stand in case of war! And war will undoubtedly come sooner or later unless the American people are willing to resign their possessions without a struggle. Aside from the question of naturalizing the Japanese, which appears to he a sop to appease their wrath, the president asks congress to do an unheard of thing—that is, to give the president the right to enforce the executive opinion in sovereign states by the use of the Federal army and navy. It is true that the army and navy were used in the Civil War, but they were not used until the Southern states had openly eeeeded from the Union and declared themselves beyond the pale of the Constitution. With the power to overturn state Jaws by the use of the United States soldiery, what safeguard would we have against the rising of a second Napoleon Bonaparte? What is the condition of affairs in countries where the army is supreme? Mexico has a dictator. Do we need one, too? BOW
