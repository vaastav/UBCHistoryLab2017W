President's Message President Roosevelt lu liis annual message again urges the enactment of a law prohibiting corporations from contributing to campaign fnmls. He also urges the passage of the measure , conferring upon the goverumeut the j right of appeal In criminal cases 011 questions of law. Continuing, the. president says: 1 cannot too strongly urge the pas sage of the bill In question. A failure j to pass It will result in seriously ham pering the government I11 its effort to i obtain justice, especially against! wealthy Individuals or corporations j who do wrong, anil may also prevent 1 the government from obtaining justice j for wageworkers who lire not tliem-1 selves able effectively to contest a case j where the judgment of an inferior 1 court has been against them. I have | specifically In view a recent decision j by a district judge leaving railway | employees without remedy for viola- : lion of a certain so called labor statute. The importance of enacting into law 1 lie particular bill In question Is fur ther Increased by the fact that the gov ernment has now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law In those trust and interstate commerce cases where such a course offers a rea sonable chance of success. 

PROPER USE OF INJUNCTIONS. la my last message I suggested the enactment of 11 low in connection with the Issuance of injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the mat ter'by tile demand that the right of ap- 1 plying injunctions in labor eases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts, in which case, of course, the legislation would be ineffective. More over. I believe it would be wrong alto gether to prohibit the use of injunc tions. It is criminal to permit sym pathy for criminals to weaken our bands in upholding the law. and if ' men seek to destroy life or property | by mob violence there should be 110 im- , imminent or rue power or iue rouns iu ? ? leal with tliein In the most summary | anil effective way possible. But so J lar as possible the abuse of tbe power should lie provided against by some ' such law as I advocated last year. AGAINST LYNCHING. I call your attention and the atten tion of the nation to the prevalence of crime among us and. above all, to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up now in one part of our country, now in another. Knell sec tion, north, south, east or west, has its own faults. No section can with wisdom spend its time Jeering at the faults of another section. It should be busy trying to amend its own short comings. To deal with the crime of corruption it is necessary to have an awakened public conscience aud to supplement this by whatever legisla- j tion will add speed and certainty in J the execution of the law. When we j deal with lynching even more is neces sary. A great many white men are lynched, but the crime is peculiarly frequent in respect to black men. The greatest existing cause of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black men, of the hideous crime ot' rape, the most abominable in all the category oi crimes, even worse than murder. Lawlessness grows by what it feeds upon, and when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations and lyucli for many other kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the lyuchings are not lor rape at all. while a considerable I proportion of the individuals lynched j arc innocent of all crime. There is but one safe rule ifl dealing with black men as with white men ; li is the same rule that must be ap- i plied in dealing with rich men and poor men?that is, to treat each man, 1 whatever his color, his creed or his so cial position, witli e\*eii handed justice on his real worth as a man. White I people owe it quite as much to them selves as to the colored race to treat well the colored man who shows by ! bis life that lie deserves snob treatment, i There is no question of social equalilv or negro domination involved. in my judgment, (lie crime of rape should always be punished with death, ! us is the ease with murder. Assaults with intent to commit rape should lie made a capital crime, at least in the discretion of the court, and provision ! should be made by which the punish- 1 meut may follow Immediately upon (he heels of the offense. No more shortsighted policy can be , Imagined than in the fancied interest of one class to prevent the education of another class. The white man, if 1 lie is wise,_ will decline to allow the negroes in 'a mass to grow to man i hood and womanhood without eduen- i tion. "PREACHERS C>E MERE DISCON- i TENT." In dealing with both labor and cap- j It'll, with the questions affecting both corporations and trades unions, there ! is one matter more important to re member than aught else, aud that is 1 the infinite harm done by preachers of mere discontent. These are the men who seek to excite a violent class ha- ' trod against all men of wealth. They ! seek to turn wise and proper move ments for the belter control of corpora tions and for doing away with the ! abuses connected with'wealth Into a ! fciunpaigii of hysterical excitement and falsehood in which the aim Is to iu- I flame to madness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogues 1 aud foolish visionaries who nre always i eager to uudertake such a campuigu | of destruction sometimes seek to as- ' sooiate themselves with those working ! a gem/Ine reform in governmental j and social methods aud sometimes nuts- i Vho^'"iPrJ's.i'<"c,) ''eforiuers. in reulllv they are the worst enemies of tile Cause they profess to advocate, just as the purveyors of sensational slander in I newspaper or niagnziue are the worst J enemies of all men who are engaged in :'N kotu*d o better what is bad , hi our social and governmental :i < 'orrttpfion Is never so rife as in com munities where .thefjfleumgogne and the agitatftri bear fullfgswny, because in such communities all moral bunds he come loosened, and hysteria and sensa tionalism rep lace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing na between I man and man. in sheer revolt against i tlie squalid ainm-hy tliils produced men | are sure lu the end to turn toward any I leader who ean restore order, and then their relief ui being free'from the in tolerable burdens of class hatred, vlo lence and demagogy is such that they cannot for some time he aroused to in dignation against misdeeds by men of wealth, so that they permit a new growth of the very abuses Wbjdi Were lu part responsible for the original out break. The one bope for success for our people lies in a resolute and f?m j less but suae and cool beaded udvunfce i along the path marked out last year ; by tills very congress. There must be j a stern refusal to be misled Into fol lowing either that base creature who appeals and panders to the lowest In stincts find passions in order to arouse one set of Americans against their fel lows or that other creature, equally base, but no baser, who in a spirit of greed or to accumulate -or add to an already huge fortune seeks to exploit bis fellow Americans with callous dis regard to their welfare of soul and body. The man who debauches others in order to obtain a high otllec stands on an qyil equality of corruption with the man who debauches others for fimtnclal profit, and when hatred is sown the crop which springs up cam only be evil. The plain people who think?the me chanics, farmers, merchants, workers with bend or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors?owe It to them selves to remember that the most dam aging blow that ean bo given popular government is to elect an unworthy and sinister -agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. RAILROAD EMPLOYEES' HOl'RS. I'cull your attention to the need of passing the bill limiting the number of hours of employment of railroad em ployees. Th? measure is a very moder ate one, and I can conceive of 110 seri ous objection to it. Indeed, so far as it Is in our power, It should lie our aim steadily to reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general in troduction of an eight hour day. There are industries in which it is not pos sible that the hours of labor should lie reduced, just as there are communi ties not far enough advanced for suelt 11 movement to be for their good, or, if in the tropica, so situated that there is no analogy between their needs and ours In this matter. O11 the isthmus of Panama, for instance, the condi tions are in every way so different from what they are here that an eight hour day would be absurd, just as it is absurd, so far as the isthmus is con cerned. where white labor cannot lie employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work is done by alien black men or by alien yellow men. But the wageworkers of the I'nited States are of so high a grade that alike from the -vi.. :... 1 1 . f ...wl uinn,( iiiuiiM i i;ii mnuujtuiui uuvi iium the civic standpoint it should lie our object to do what we can in the direc tion of securing the general observance of an eight hour day. Let mo again urge that the congress provide for a thorough investigation of the conditions of child labor and of the labor of women in the United States. The horrors incident to tlie employment of young children In fac tories or at work anywhere are a blot on our civilization. In spite of all precautions exercised by employers there are unavoidable ac cidents and even deaths involved in nearly every line of business connect ed with the mechanic arts. It is a great social injustice to compel the em ployee, or, rather, the family of the killed or disabled victim, to bear the entire burden of such an Inevitable sacrifice. In other words, society shirks its duty by laying the whole cost on the victim, whereas the injury comes from what may lie called the legiti mate risks of the trade. Compensation for accidents or deaths due in any line of industry to the actual conditions un der which that industry is carried on should lie paid by that portion of the .romuimiily for the benefit of which the Industry is carried on?that Is, by liiosc \\iio profit by the industry. If the entire trade risk is placed upon (lie employer, he will promptly and prop erly add il to the legitimate cost of pro duction and assess it proportionately upon the consumers of his commodity. II is therefore clear to my mind that the law should place this entire "risk of a trade" upon the employer. CAPITAL AND LABOR DISPUTES. Records show (hat during the twen ty years from .Tan. 1. 38S1. to Doc. .'it, l'.HH). there were strikes affecting 117. 50!) establishments, and li.1llo.lBM em ployees were thrown out of employ ment. During the same period there were 1,005 lockouts," involving nearly IIi.lKill establishments, throwing over 1.1)00,000 people out of employment. Tlipse strikes and lockouts involved ai) estimated loss to employees of s.'tol. iK)o,utH) and to employers of $145,000, 000, a total of $400,000,1 KiO. The public suffered directly and Indirectly prob ably as groat additional loss. Many of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred had the par ties to the dispute been required to appear before an unprejudiced body representing the natioy and. face to face, slute the reasons for their con tention. The exercise of a judicial spirit by a disinterested body repre senting the federal government, such as would tie provided by a commission on conciliation and arbitration, would tend to create an atmosphere of friend liness and conciliation between con tending parties. CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS. It cannot too often be repeated that experience ,1ms conclusively shown the Impossibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything byi ineffective chaos in the way jleaHng!wtKli the 1 I ; ~~ ~ ~\ great corporations which do noi oper-'1 nte exclusively within tlw limits of ( 1 any one state. Ih same method, wheth- i er by n national license law or ill other i fashion, we must exercise. aiul that at ? till early date, a filr more complete' I toutt'ol than at present Over tiiese great t Corporations?a control lliat will, among 1 oilier tilings, prevent the evils of ex- 1 cesslve overcapitalization and that will compel (lie disclosure h.v each big cor poration of its stockholders and yf its | properties and, business, whether own- j , ed directly or through subsidiary or' , attlliated corporations. This will tend 1 t to put n stop to the securing of luor-! diuute pro tits by fitvored individuals at | the expense whether of the general , , public, the stockholders or the wage-1 | workers. Our effort should lie not so f much to prevent consolidation as such. , but so to supervise aud control il as i ( to see that It results in no harm to (lie ' people. Combination of capital, like combine-; j lion of labor, is it necessary element of j ( j our present industrial system. It is ( | not possible completely to prevent il. ! ^ I and if It were possible such complete j prevention would do damage to 1 ho j j j body politic. What we need is not; i vainly to try to prevent all eomblnn- | ' tion. but to secure such rigorous and j , adequate control and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their i 1 injuring the public or existing in such . form as inevitably to threaten Injury, 1 for tile mere frtt-t that a combination 1 lias secured practically complete con trol of n necessary of life would under any circumstances show that such ' combination was to be presumed to lie I adverse to the public Interest. Il is < unfortunate that our present laws j 1 should forbid nil combinations instead I of sharply discriminating between 11 those combinations which do good and < those coinliillntidus Which do evil, lie bates, for Instance, lire as often due to j the pressure of l?lg shippers (as was j i shown in the investigation of the ; Standard Oil company and as has lieen j ? shown since by the investigation of ? Hie tobacco and sugar trusts) ns to the i initiative of big railroads. Often rail- , roads would like to combine for the , purpose of preventing a big shipper , from maintaining Improper advantages at the expense of small shippers and i of the general public. Such a eomblnn- ( tion, Instead of being forbidden by law. i should he favored. In other words, II j, should he permitted to railroads to ! ] make agreements, provided these agree- |( inputs were sanctioned by the inter- j state commerce commission and were published. With these two conditions , complied with it is Impossible to see | what harm such a combination could j do to the public at large. 

INHERITANCE AND INCOME TAX. , The national government lias long | | derived its chief revenue from a tariff . i on imports and from an Internal or ex cise tax. In addition to these, there Is j every reason why. when next our sys tem of taxation is revised, the national ! government should impose a graduated 1 inheritancetjRx and, if possible, a grail- ' uated Income tax. I am "well aw are thai such a subject ] as tills needs long mid careful study in order {lint the people may become fa miliar with wlmt is proposed to be done, may clearly sec the necessity of proceeding with wisdom and self re straint and may make up their minds 1 just how far they are willing to go in 1 the matter, while only trained legisla- ' tors can work out the project In neces- |' snry detail. Rut I feel that in the near future our national legislators should'1 enact a law providing for a graduated ' inheritance tax by which a steadily in 1 creasing rate of duty should be put j upon all moneys or other valuables 1 coining by gift, liequest or devise to ? any individual or corporation. There can be no question of the ethical pro priety of the government thus deter mining the conditions upon which any 1 gift or Inheritance should be received. 1 As the law now stands it is undoubt- I edly difficult to devise a national in come tax which shall be constitutional. Rut whether it is absolutely impossible Is another question, anil if possible jt I | is most certainly desirable. The first 1 j purely income tax law was passed by I I the congress in 180J. but the most Ini | portant law dealing with the subject I | was- that of lN'.M. This the court held 1 j to be unconstitutional, j The question is undoubtedly very in- jl tricute. delicate and troublesonlb. ,'lie j I 1 decision of the court was only reached j' j by one majority. It is the law of the , : land and of course is accepted as such j | and loyally obeyed by all good citizens I Nevertheless the hesitation evidently | felt by the court as a whole in coming to a conclusion, when considered to getlier with previous decisions 011 the < subject, may perhaps indicate the pos- |l slhllity of devising a constitutional in- 1 come tax law which shall substantially accomplish the results aimed at. The 1 difficulty of amending the constitution 1 is so great that only real necessity can 1 justify a resort thereto. Every effort I 1 should Is1 made in dealing with this I 1 subject, as with the subject of the ( proper control by the national govern 1 mcnt over the use of corporate wealth ' in interstate business, to devise legis- 1 latlon which without such a< tluii shall 1 , attain the desired end, but if this fails ' 1 there will ultimately lie 11 > alternative to a constitutional amendment. INDUSTRIAL TRAIN IXC. Our industrial development depends ; 1 largely upon te-hnical education. In- 1 I eluding in this term all Industrial edu cation. from that which tits a man" to i I be a goodfuicclniuic. a good carpenter ; or blacksmith to that which tits a man : to. do the greatest engineering feat. | The skilled mechanic, the skilled work ; man. run best become such by teeli I nicnl industrial education.

I nui well aware of how dllHciilt it is to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless, in my judgment, the whole quest Ion ok marriage and di vorce should lie relegated to the au thority of the national congress. The ?li.'inge would he good from every itnUdpolnt. Ill particular It would he good because it would confer on the ) rongress the power at . once to deaf radically and efficiently with polygamy. I mid this should lie done whether or j lot marriage and divorce are dealt witli. It Is neither sal'e nor proper to i leave the question of polygamy to he i lea It with by the several states. MERCHANT MARINE. Ret me once again call the attention j if the congress to two subjects con- ! reining which I have frequently be- : Pore com in un lea ted with tlicm. One Is : the question of developing America!) (hipping. I trust that a law embody- ' lug In substance the views or a major , part of the views expressed !u the re- i port On this subject laid before the house at Its last session will lie passed. | It seems to me that the proposed meas ure is as nearly unobjectionable us any j ran be. THE CURRENCY. I especially call your attention to the i second inbjeet. I ho condition of our ! currency laws, The national bank act j has ably served a great purpose in aid ing the enormous business develop ment of the country, and within ten years there has been an Increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to S,OS. For several years evidence lias been accumulating that additional leg islation Is needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphasizes the de fects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, because to leave them as they are means to in cur liability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has been a fluctuation in the Interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30 per cent. : and the fluctuation was even greater j during the preceding six months. ?The secretary of the treasury had to step in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. I do not press any especial plan. Va rious plans have recently been pro posed by expert committees of bank ers. Among the plnns which are possl- | lily feasible and which certainly should receive your Consideration is that re j peatedly brought to your attention by the present secretary of the treasury, the essential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According ! lo tills plan, national banks should lie j permitted to issue a specified propor tion of their capital in notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high' i n rate as to drive the notes back when 1 not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the Issue of j currency to give banks additional prof- j its, but to meet the emergency present- I ad by times of stringency. I do not say that Mils is the right sys tem. 1 only advance it to emphasize my belief that there is need for the adoption of some system which shall lie automatic and open to nil sound banks so as to avoid all possibility of liscrimination and favoritism. The law should be amended so as Specifically to provide that the funds . lerlved from customs duties may lie treated by the secretary of the Irons nry as he treats funds obtained under I the internal revenue laws. There shouldf lie a considerable increase in : hills of small denominations. Permis sion should be given banks, if necessa r.v under settled restrictions, to retire their circulation to a larger amount than three millions a month. OUR 

OUTLYING POSSESSIONS. I most earnestly liope thai the bill to provide a lower tariff for or else abso lute free trade in Philippine products will become a law. No harm will come to any American industry, and. while there will he some small but real mate rial benefit to the Filipinos, the main benefit will come by the allowing made as to our purpose to do all in our power for llieir welfare. PORTO UICAN AFFAIRS. American citizenship should lie con ferred on the citizens of Porto Itico. The harbor of Sau.iuan, in Porto ltico. should be dredged ami Improved. The expenses of the federal court of Porto Itico should be met from tlie federal treasury. . m JjjffljjtL. ? HAWAII. The needs Of HdWnlfc are j>e miliar. Every afd' should lie glvnf flit' fslrtitdsi.

RIGHTS OK ALIENS. Not only must we treat all nations fairly, lint we must treat with justice mil good will all immigrants who come lieI'e Under tile law, Whether they are I'ntholic or IVofestaut. Jen or gentile, Whether tiicy eome from England or Germany, Russia, la pan 01' Italy, inflt ters nothing. All we Imve it right to piestlon is the mail's eonduct. If lit? is inmost and upright in his dealings ivlth his neighbor and with the state, hen he is entitled to respect and good ireatmeht. Especially do we need to remember our duty to the stranger IVithin our gates. It Is the sure mark >f a low civilization, a low morality, to iilmse or discriminate against or In any way humiliate such stranger Who has como here lawfully and who is rati; ducting himself properly. To remem ber this is Incumbent ou every Amer ican citizen, and it is of course pecul iarly Incumbent 011 every government oitieial, when her of tbo nation or of tbe several slates, I am prompted to say tin's by the attitude of hostility here and there as sumed toward the Japanese lu (his country. This hostility is sporadic and is limited to a very few places. Never theless it is most discreditable to us as a people, and it may be fraught With the gravest consequences to the bat loll. I ask fair treatment for the Japanese as 1 would ask fair treatment for Ger mans or Englishmen, frenchmen, Rus sians or Italians. I ask il as due to humanity and civilization. I ask It as j due to ourselves, because we must net j uprightly toward all men. I ?recom mend to the congress that nn act bo passed specifically providing for tbe naturalization of Japanese who eome hero Intending to become American cit izens, One of the great embarrass- ! ineiits attending tbe performance of our international obligations is the fact that tbe statutes of the United ' States are entirely inadequate. They 1 fall to give to the national government sufficiently ample power.'through Unit ed States courts uud by tbe use of tbe army and navy, to protect aliens I11 the ' rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the Tiilled States he so amended and add ed to as trf enable the president, acting for the United States government. 1 which is responsible in onr Interna tional relations, to enforce the rights ; of aliens under treaties. THE 

CUBAN MATTER. Last August ou insurrection broke out in Cuba which it speedily grew evi dent that the existing Cu^an govern ment was powerless to quell. Thanks to the preparedness of our navy. I was aide immediately to send enough ships to Cuba to prevent the situation from becoming hopeless, and 1 fur thermore dispatched to Cuba the sec retary of war and the assistant secre tary of state in order that they might grapple with the situation on the ground. In accordance with the so called I'lntt amendment, which was embod ied in the constitution of Cuba, I there upon proclaimed a provisional govern ment for (lie island, the secretary of war acting as provisional governor un til lie could he replaced by Mr. Magoon. the late minister to Panama and gov ernor of the canal zone on the isthmus. Troops were sent to support them and to relieve the navy, the expedition be ing handled with most satisfactory sliced and efficiency. Peace lias come in the island, and the harvesting of the sugar cane crop, the great crop of the island, is about to proceed. When (lie election lias boon held and the new government inaugurated in peaceful and orderly fashion the provisional government will come to an end. The United States wishes nothing of ? 'ulia except that it shall prosper mor ally and materially and wishes nothing of the Cubans save that they shall he utile to preserve* order among them selves and therefore to preserve their independence. If the elections become a farce and if the insurrectionary 'habit becomes confirmed 011 ilie island it is absolutely out of the question that the island should continue independent, and the United States, which lias as sumed the sponsorship before the civ ilized world for Cubtrs career as 11 mi lion, would again have to intervene and to see that tin* government was managed in such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property. THE Rio CONFERENCE. The second liilcrnalioual conference of American republics, held in Mexi co in the years Paul uj, provided for the holding ol' the third conference within live years and committed the fixing of the time and place and the arrangements for the conference to tin governing hoard of the bureau ol American republics, composed of tin representatives of all ilie American nations In Wnsliingion.

P The destruction of the Prildlof is- !l land fur seals by pelagic scaling still ^ continues. The heril. which, according t to the survey made in IHTt liy direc- r tlott of the congress, numbered t.Tnn.- j 000. and which, according to the stir- c voy of hotli American and Canadian > commissioners In tsttl, amounted to I tjtiOfMKJO. lias now been reduced to 1 about lftf'.hho. This result lats been ' brought about by Canadian and some j other sealing vessel- hilling the female seals while in the wales* during their annual pilgrimage to and from tbe south or In search of food. Tbe process of destruction has been accelerated during recent years by the appearance of a number of Japanese Vessels engaged in pelagic settling. Suitable representations regarding the incident have been made to the government of Japan, and we are as sured that all practicable measures will be taken by that country to prevent any recurrence of the outrage. We have not relaxed our efforts tc secure an agreement with Great Brit ain for adequate protection of the seal herd, and negotiations with Japan for tin" same purpose are in progress. Theidtvs for the protection of the seals within the jurisdiction of the t'nited States need revision and amendment. SECOND HAGUE CONFERENCE. c In my last message I advised you ] that the emperor of Russia llad taken t the initiative in bringing about n see- I olid peace conference at The Hague. Under tbe guidance of Russia the ar- 1 rangemetit of the preliminaries for such a conference lias been progressing ] during the past year. Progress lias , necessarily been slow, owing to the ] great number of countries to lie eon- ( suited upon every question that lias ! arisen. It is a matter of satisfaction Hint nil of (be American republics have now, for the first time, been invited to J join in the proposed conference. ARMY AND NAVY. It must ever bo kept in mind that i \vnr is not merely Justifiable, but im perative upon honorable men. upon an [ honorable nation, where peace can only lie obtained by the sacrifice of ? conscientious conviction or of national welfare. The I'uited Stntes navy is the surest . guarantor of peace which this country t possosies. I do not ask that we con- ( thine to Increase our navy. I ask merely that it lie maintained at its i present strength, and this can lie done only if we replace the obsolete and out worn ships by new and good ones, the equals of any afloat in any navy. To slop bulklirg ships for one year means | that for that year the navy goes hack ! instead of forward.
