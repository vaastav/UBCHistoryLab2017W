Democratic Money. The depreciated currency of the West ern and Southern States, is now denomin ated "Democratic Money." The depre ciation in value of this currency first commenced by the Democratic politicians and cotton merchants in .New York city in their endeavors to get up a "panic" to .defeat the election of Lincoln. Since .then the .brokers, and. "bears," of the Democratic persuasion,' finding it to their interest(have kept crying it down.until all J hose banks which are secured by stocks ot the Democratic States, have greatly depreciated, in value; thus it is that this currency is called "Democratic money." 'And as a natural consequence, currency !n good j repute, is now beginning to be termed 'Lincoln Money."

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. . As we gave the Message to our readers m an extra last week, the document will not appear in o.ur regular issue. . Our sentiments in regard to this last produc tion of the old Public Functionary are so fully expressed in the columns of the Cleveland Herald that we cannot refrain from making use of its own language instead of attempting to improve on it. That paper says, "it is what we expected, but not what we hoped. The wny was open to Mr. Buchanan to retrieve his hon or, in part at least, from the oul stains which have polluted it for the last four years. The profligacies end the corrup tions of the Federal Government, during his Administration, are passed, though not forgotten. No act of the President could cleanse his political robes of the record which a searching investigation has laid before the world, but it was left for him, had he been possessed of the spirit of patriotism and moral courage, to make his last official days his best days, and to retire with some degree of credit. He saw a portion of the coun try convulsed with a revolution against a constitutional act, and heard open threats of treason and rebellion agains' t hat Government of which he is the head. He felt the confederated fabric tremble under the hurried rushing to and fro of armed men, banded together with no other purpose under heaven but the de struction of the Union. He saw, on the other hand, a myriad of peaceable citi zens, who, having committed no unlawful act, waited patiently for their executive Head to plant himself in the path of the hordes who were arrayed against law arid order. Here was a field for the exercise of statesmanship and decision that wo'd bave given to James Buchanan, spite of all his infamous antecedents, the credit of being still possessed of one remaining spark of national respect and political honor. Had he now stepped boldly for ward, and met the rebellious' seceders with the edict,'Thus far have ye'gone.but, by the Eternal, no farther .shall ye go," he would have retired to the shades of Wheatland with the consciousness that he had done one act to entitle him to a place among those who have served their country. And Mr. Buchanan . could not fail to see this, and know that he bad,in a mea sure, his future srood name in bis hands! as he penned his Message. But with the Message before us, where do wc find bim?! Weak, vacPating, cowardly; shirking the responsibility upon the people North, and the people South, upon Northern legis lation, and most of all upon Congress. He dares to do nothing bimse'.f, and flics from one cover and another,like a fright ened hare when the dogs in the kenue 1 howl. In the endeavor to stand be tween the North and South, he is consis tent to the position of neither. It is a violation of the Constitution for any State to secede, but if .any -Slate does secede, no power in Congress nor out of it can prevent it. He acknowledges it the du ty of the Executive to enforce the laws "and from this obligation, he cannot be absolved by any buman power," and yet because it would be difficult, if not ini possible, to replace the machinery of the Federal Government in South Carolina, he is powerless to interfere and chooses to wait nntil Congress shall pass laws so as to more effectually carry out the de signs of the Constitution, hoping, doubt less, that from their dissensions, no such laws will be passed until he has lett the responsible' seat that he now holds. l be Message will do no good at the South. Indeed, the secession press has repeatedly declared that, let the docu ment be what it would, it would have no effect upon their movements. The ques tion is still open. The President reviews the history of the Constitution; entreats his fellow countrymen to pause before they destroy the Confederation; refers to the unsatis factory aspect of foreign . and domestic affairs when he took the Presidential chair; and returns thanks for present pros perity. Summary of Washington Gossip. The treasury is so hard up that it is feared that the $1,5110,000 interest due January 1st. in coin, will have to he drawn directly from the Mint. The country now gathers nothing but the bitterest fruits for its blind adherence to bogus Demo cracy. It is understood at Washington that a volunteer force of 3000 men stand ready to capture Fort Moultrie in case the Gen eral Government signifies its intention to use force against South Carolina. Prominent Southern men continue their protestations that the election of Lincoln is not the cause of the secession move ment. They substantially allege that Cotton must rule either in the Union or in a separate confederacy. It is intima ted that the only compromise that could be possibly acceptable to the South would be an amendment of the Constitution, providing for two Counsellors, to be cho sen by the North, and South respeiclve- 1.. u...u r ...i . F. . j, uum ui wuosc signatures shall be ne cessary to all measures of legislation in addition to that of the President. It is thought Secretarv Cobb wi 11 ly resign not, however, for reasons con nected with his disunion views but be cause he has run the Treasury into the ground, ana cannot get it out. He will be succeeded, it is believed, by PoKtaas ter-General Holt. Cobb's resignation will probably be followed by the resignation of benator Hunter, as Chairman of the finance Committee, of the Senate. Hun tar would in all likelihood be succeeded by ressenden. Mr. Powell's resolution in the Senate to raise a committee to enquire into the national troubled, lies over under the rule It is thought many of the Republican Senators will vote fo it, without necessa rily committing themselves to any partic ular line of policy. Old Buck has actually mustered up courage enough to say he will colU'ct the revenues of all ports of seceding States, at all hazards. We will see when the test comes, if it ever does. The California Senators assert that under no circumstances will that State leave the Union. - ' There is an encouraging display of Re publiean back-bone at Washington. Re publicans say that all they can consistent ly concede will not satisfy the d is union -ist; and that they will not yield to those who expect and threaten to leave the Union at all hazards. Every effort will be made bv the se cesiooists to carry the border States oul of the Union with (he Cotton States. It Maryland can be drawn into the secession movement, the disunionists will attempt to make Washington the Capital of the new confederacy 1 The constant complaints of the English Government that American citizens con-, stanlly violate all laws and treaties pro hibiting the African slave trade, are re garded at Washington as indications that British sympathy will be with the North em States against the Southern in case of disunion. It is understood that as Chairman of the committee of thirty-three, on condi tion of the country, Mr. Corwin will pro pose as a compromise an amendment to section third of article second of the Con stitution, by striking out that portion which authorizes Congress to make all needful rules and regulations for the ter ritories hereafter to be organized the people to elect their own officers, Ssc. O i Journal, 1 1th inst. , Scene in the Senate. The Cin. Commercial's telegraph cor respondent gives a scene in the Senate as follows: Washington, Dec.5. On motion concerning the reference of the President's message, Lane, of Ore gon, made an apology for the dissolution of the Union, saying it must dissolve unless the rights of the South are further guar anteed. ! Hale, of New Hampshire, said the logic of this controversy wis war or sub mission. 1 he m'nonty must submit to the majority. He made no threats, and spoke without having consulted anybody; ne spoke lor nimseit only, and one little State. 'We must look this matter straight in the face." brown, of Miss., desired to know if Hale presented the issue of war or sub mission. Hale said it must lead to that He made no threat. Brown replied sternly: "We will not submit.and il it is war let it come aud Gcd show the right." Iverson ot Ga., was qniet at first, bat haughty in the end. He accepted the President's declaration that secession is revolmion. "The States undersianj they do it at the peril of consequence." tie did not believe H would lead to war, but if it dues the South is preparing to receive its enemies with.blaodly hands and hospitable graves. He hoped there would be no war; that we would live in peace. 1 lie boutli would regard the North a- mong thr most favored of nations, and so treat with her, but to remain in the Union she would not. No power on earth could prevent her withdrawal, The repeal of all the personal liberty bills of the North would be vain. "True. they are obnoxious, but we care nothing for their practical operation. But we know their existence shows the feeling of the people. They indicate two dis tinct civilizations. The hatred of the North for the South is deep as bell, and I tell my brethren on the other side of the floor no love is lost between us. Two hostile nations occupy this floor. We are enemies. They did not come a cross this floor to extend us ordinary civilities, yesterday, nor did we go to them. We are hostile. The State I repre sent accepts the issue of war or submis sion. We will not submit. I tell the gen tleman South Carolina will not go alone. Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Geor gia, will all be out by January loth, nev er to return: and in less than twelve months after our Government will be in operation, Arkansas and Louisiana will follow. One thing only prevents Texas that is her Governor, and if he does not yield to overwhelming public senti ment some Texan Brutus will reach his heart, and rid the world of a vile and hoary-beaded traitor." Mr. Iverson discarded all shams, say ng inat tne election ot .Lincoln was no cause for secession, but the South would not be governed by the North, and intended to go out while she had the strength, not to wait until she was too weak. . Douglas sat scowling in his sent; The North- Southern men looked cool. ern men were calm and collected. Crit tenden was profoundly moved, and the galleries were astounded. Jeff. Davis, in quick decisive way, said he came as a Senator of the Uniied States. While there is yet no declaration of war against the States of which wc are the mere embassadors, he wo'd discharge his duty as Senator, and wo'd say nothing on the subject. Wigfall talked Senators out of their seats, but he said one thing. He said that he disagreed with Hale. That S-n- ator said the President's messnge was neither one thing nor the other. Wig- fall thought it both one thing and the other. Saulbury, of Delaware, made an ear nest and tloquent plea lor the Union, which was received with thunders ol applause from the calleries. He said Delaware was the 6rst to go into the Union and would be the last to go out. She would use all her power to preserve the Uo'on. The disunion speeches were received in profound silence. JtSTTke census of Cincinnati, has been retaken by Mr. C. S. Williams under tbe direction of the municipal authorities. His enumeration brings the population up to 171,293; about 10,000 more than the figures of the government census. Mr.W states that the school census affords the most unreliable basis for calculating the aggregate population. The Kansas War Humbug Completely ' ; Exposed. : s 'Gen. J. F. Snyder, Division Inspec tor of the Sixth Military District of the Missouri Mi'itia, writes from Boliver, Mo., under date of December 3, to the St. Louis Republican, a letter which leaves the sensation reporters of civil war in Kansas not a foot of ground to . . . ... -i i stand on. wequote-ihe essential por-1 tion of the communication: Ma. Editor: Before this reaches you the majority of your readers . will have ascertained that the "invasion" of the State by Montgomery, which caused so much excitement, was, so lar as the "in vasion" is concerned, the merest piece ol M unchausenism. without any lounda- lion in truth. How the yarn that James Montgomery and his gang of horse thieves had "taken Fort Scott, could cause any excitement in the estate oi Missouri, is a mystery; for every one knows that he has had Fort Scott and all of Southern Kansas for the last three years. You have, perhaps, learned by this time that the "three hundred arm- i i i ... II .1 crt. ., ed outlaws wno invauea tne oiaie "took Fort Scott," and "broke up the United States District Court," have dwindled down to certain threats of Montgomery's and Jennison's, and a bout six'een vagabond Abolitionists who lurked about Fort Scott but a few days before the Court was to have been held. It is true that Montgomery is an anti- slavery fanatic, of the Jonn Brown chool, and that he has been to the North, recently, and returned with arms of dif ferent kinds. It is true that he has dis tributed those arms to about two hun dred of hi ragged followers, who scat ter to their dens at the approach of dan ger, and are whistled together again like a flock of quails. It is true that Mont gomery is harboring a few fugitive slaves, and that Jennison has made certain dec larations of waging war "upon the curse of slavery in Missouri;" and it is true that Jennison, Montgomery & Co., have recently shot Moore and Bishop, and hung Harrison, Hines and Sam Scott. And that is all of it. Bad enough to be sure; but all these outrages concern the Territory of Kansas, nd not Missouri. Miy is it mat the federal Government has not heretofore enforced the fugitive slave law in Kansas, and checked the course of the outlaws there, are mat ters which I do not now propose to dis cuss. The prompt action of our Executive, in taking steps to protect our Western fron tier, cannot be too highly applauded or appreciated: but the idea of marching the gallant St. Louis Brigade to the South west, is, to one familiar with the state of affairs on the border, very amusing. We want no St. Louis so'diery to protect us. I feel great sati.-faction in stating that the militia of my district is fully adequate to the defense of our State against all the ragged, nigger steal ng outlaws that Jim Montgomery ma' be able to march against us. All we ask of the Governor is to furnish us with arms and other munitions of war. Ad ministrator s OF
