'Jts&i, W T"'l* Sf ti£' 3* 1 •. "i *, Washington, Dec. S—The president's •nnual message was transmitted to congress today. It opens with a plea lor the co-operation of all classes in continuing the country's prosperity and in correcting existing evils and asks, for a "square deal" 'or everytody. The'-question of corporations and rate i«« atlon is first taken up. 'The re S a Corporations. ani in no sense hostile to corpora tlons. This is an age of combination, and any effort to prevent nil combina tion will be not only useless, but in the «nd vicious, because of the contempt vfor law wbicb the failure to enforce law inevitably produces. The corpora tion has come to stay, just as the trades union has come to stay. Each «an do and has done great good. Each should be favored so long as it does good.. 1 But each should be sharply checked,where It acts against law and Justice. t'' Experience has shown conclusively that it is useless to try to get any ade quate regulation and supervision of 'these great corporations by state ae tlon. Such regulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised by a Sovereign whose jurisdiction is coex tensive with tbe_field work of the cor porations—that is, by the national gov •rnmeut. I believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the ^enactment of law by the congress. If this proves Impossible, it will certainly "be necessary ultimately to confer In fullest form such power upon the na tional government by affirmative ac- Dent of the constitution. The lavre of the congress and of the Several states hitherto, as passed upon by the court*, hare resulted more often In showing that the states have no power In the matter than that the na tional government Uas power so that there at present exists a very unfortu liate condition of things, under which these great corporations doing an in terstate business occupy the position of subjects without a sovereign, neither any state government nor the national government having effective control over them. Our steady, aim should be by legislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, but reuolutely persevered In, to assert the sovereignty of the ha- 'tional government by affirmative ac tion. This Is only in form an innovation. In substance It Is merely a restoration, for from the earliest time such regula tion of industrial activities has been recognized in the action of the law making bodies, and all that I propose Is to meet the changed conditions in such manner as will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power it has always possessed, not only in this coun try, but also In England before and since this ^ountry became a separate ^nation. Railroad Rate Legislation. As 1 said in my message of Dec. 6 last, the immediate and most pressing faeed so far as legislation is concerned Is, the enactment Into law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the government such supervision and regu lation of the rates charged by the rail toads of the country engaged in inter­ state traffic as shall summarily and ef fectively prevent the imposition of un just or unreasonable rates. It must include putting a complete stop to re bates in every shape and form. This power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world, should be exercised with moderation, caution and self restraint, but it should exist, wo that it can be effectively exercised iwhen the need arises. In my judgment, the most important provision which such law should con -tain is that conferring upon some com petent administrative body the power to decide upon the case being brought before it whether a given rate pre scribed by a railroad is reasonable and Jnst, and If it is found to be unreason gj-,jkble and unjust then, after full investl f' gatlon of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go—the maximum reasonable rate, as It is commonly call ed—this decision to go Into effect with in a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens at pfesent, not & that a rate is too high, but that a fa £y vored shipper is given too low a rate. In such case the commission would bave the right to. fix this already estab lished minimum rate as the maximum, and It would need only one or two such decisions by the commission to cure railroad companies of the practice of giving improper miaipium rates. I call your attention to the fact that my pro posal is not to give the commission power to Initiate or originate rates gen erally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or originated by the roads upon complaint and after Investigation. A heavy penalty should be exacted from any corporation which fails to respect an order of the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme 'of real reform in the matter of railway tegulation. It is •Ibis We worth while considering whether It would to such alising not be wise to confer on the "government against the «t least the right of civil action beneficiary of a rebate for twice the value of the rebate would help stop what is really blackmail. .Elevator allowances should stopped, for they have now grown an extent that they are demor­ and are used as rebates Private Car Lines. All private car Hoes, industrial roads, Refrigerator charges and the like & should be expressly put under the su pervision of the interstate commerce commission or some similar body so for as rates and agreements practical ly affecting rates are concerned. A re bate In icing charges or in mileage or in division of the rate for refrigerating •barges Is Just pernicious as a re bate In aay other way. President Roosevelt's Message Transmitted to Congress Today There should be publicity of the ac counts of common carriers. Only in this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system of examination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that uow conducted into the national banks by the bonk examiners. A few first class railroad accountants. If tliey had prop er direction and proper authority to in spect books and papers, could accom plish much in preventing willful viola tions of the law. Employer*' Liability Law. In my annual message to the Fifty eighth congress at its second session I recommended the passage of an em ployers' liability law for the District of Colombia and in our navy yards. I re newed that recommendation In my message to the Fifty-eighth congress at Its second session and further suggest ed the appointment of a commission to make a comprehensive study of em ployers' liability with a,view to the en actment of a wise and constitutional law covering the subject, applicable to all industries within the scope of the federal power 1 hope that such a law will be prepared and enacted as speed ily as possible. There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue Injunctions In labor disputes. Such special limita tion of the equity powers of ouf courts would be most unwise. It is true that some judges have misused this power, but this does not justify a denial of the power any more than an Improper ex enelse of the power to call a strike by a labor leader would justify the denial of the right to strike. The remedy is to regulate the procedure by requiring the judge to give due notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the I bearing to be ex parte If the adverse party does not appear at the time and place ordered. What is due notice must1 depend upon the facts of the case. It, should not be used as a pretext to per-' mit violation of law or the jeopardiz ing of life or property. Of course this would not authorize the issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any case In which it is not already author ized by existing law. I renew the recommendation I made In my last annual message for an in vestigation by the department of com merce and labor of general labor condi tions, especial attention to be paid to! the conditions of child labor and child labor legislation in the several states. Buch an investigation should take into account the various problems with which the question of child labor Is connected. In such a republic as ours tbe one thing that we cannot afford to neglect is the problem of turning out. decent citizens. The future of the na tion depends upon tbe citizenship of the generations to come. The children of today are those wbo tomorrow will shape tbe destiny of our land, and we cannot afford to neglect them. The leg islature of Colorado has recommended that tbe national government provide some general measure for the protec tion from abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United States. I lay the matter before you for what I trust will be your favorable consider ation. As to Vonn Who Worlc. The department of commerce and la bor should also make a thorough inves tigation of the conditions of women in industry. Over 5,000,000 American- wo men are now engaged in gainful occu pations, yet there is an almost complete dearth of data upon wbicb to base any trustworthy conclusions as regards a subject as important as it is vast and complicated. The introduction of wo men Into industiy is working change and disturbance in the domestic and social life of) the nation. The decrease in marriage, and especially in the birth rate, has been coincident with It. We must face accomplished facts, and tbe adjustment to factory conditions must be made, but surely it can be made with less friction and less harmful ef fects on family life than is now the case. This whole matter In reality forms one of tbe greatest sociological phenomena of our time. It is a social question of the first Importance, of far greater Importance than any merely po litical or economic question can be. In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employee inter ested, but also a third party—the gen eral public. Every considerable labor' difficulty in which interstate commerce !b involved should be investigated by tbe government and the facts officially reported to the public. Insurance.* The great insurance companies afford Striking examples of whose business strict enforcement corporations has beyond the extended so far jurisdiction which of the states created them as to preclude of last annual supervision and regulation by the parent states, in my message 1 "that the recommended congress carefully consider whether the power of the bureau of corporations cannot constitutionally be extended to cover interstate" transac tions in insurance." Recent events have emphasized the Importance of an early and exhaustive consideration of this question, to see whether it is not possible to furnish better safeguards than the several states have been able to furuisb against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed. It has been only too clearly shown 1 that certain of the men at the head of these large corporations take but small note of the ethical distinction between honesty and dishonesty. They draw the line only this side of what may be called law honesty, the kind of honesty necessary In order to avoid falling into the clutches of the law. Of course the only complete remedy for this condi tion must be found in an aroused pub lic conscience, a higher sense of ethical conduct in tbe community at large and especially among business men and in the great profession of tbe law, and in the growth of a spirit which condemns sll dishonesty, whether in rich man or la poor man, whether it takes tbe shape *'*P ®§E V""*, t,, \-rt or onoery or of blackmail. But much can be done "by legislation which Is not only drastic, but practical. There is need of a far stricter and more uni form regulation of the vast insurance Interests of this country. The United States should in this respect follow the policy of other nations by providing adequate national supervision of com merclal interests which are clearly na tional In character. I repeat my previous recommenda tion that the congress should consider whether the federal government has any power or owes auy duty with re spect to domestic transactions In in surance or an interstate character. That state supervision has proved In adequate is generally conceded. Tlie Revenues. There is more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal per fection In the methods of raising rev enue, and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change in these methods ren der such change inadvisable unless for grave reason. It is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to de termine the moment when the reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such a change. No change can be made on lines beneficial to or desired by one section or one state only. There must be something like a genera^agree ment among the citizens of the s'everal states that the change is needed and desired in the interest of the people as a whole, and there should then be a sin cere, intelligent and disinterested ef fort to make It in such shape as will combine, so far as possible, the maxi mum of good to the people at large with the minimum of necessary disre gard for the special Interests of locali ties or classes, but in time of peace the revenue must, on the average, taking a series of years together, equal the expenditures or else the revenues must be increased. Last year there was a deficit. Unless our expenditures can be kept within the revenues then our revenue'laws must be readjusted. It is impossible to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for it is as yet too early to ^ay whetbgr there w-ill be need for it It should "be considered whether It is not desirable that tbe tariff laws should .provide for applying as against or in favor of any other nation maximum and minimum tariff rates established by the congress, so as to secure a certain reciprocity of treatment between otber nations and ourselves. Economy In Expenditures I earnestly recommend to the con gress the need of economy and, to large saving tendency to publish great this end. of a rigid scrutiny of appropria tions. All unnecessary offices should be abolished. In tbe public printing also a of made. money can be There is a constantly growing masses of portant Information a unim­ at which no human being ever looks. Yet, in speaking of economy, I must In nowise be understood as advocating the false economy which is In the end the worst extravagance. To cut down in the navy would be a crime against the nation. To fall to push forward all work on the Panama canal would be as folly. Currency, Every consideration of prudence de mands the addition of the element of elasticity to our currency system. Tbe evil does not consist in an Inadequate volume of money, but in the rigidity of this volume, which does not respond as it should to the varying needs of communities and of seasons. Inflation must be avoided, but some provision ebould be made that will insure a larger volume of money during the fall and winter months than in the less ac tlve seasons of the year, so that the currency will contract against specula tion and will expand for the needs of legitimate business. At present the treasury department Is at irregularly recurring intervals obliged In the inter est of the business world—that Is, in the Interests of the American public— to try to avert financial crisps by pro viding^ remedy which should be pro vided by congressional action. Business Methods In Department*. At various times I have instituted in vestigations Into the organization and conduct of tbe business of the execu tive departments. While none of these Inquiries have yet progressed far enough to warrant final conclusions, they have already confirmed and em phasized the general Impression that the organization of the departments Is often faulty in principle and wasteful in results, while many of their business methods are antiquated and inefficient. 1 recommend that the congress consider this subject. Federal Elections. In my last annual message I said: "The power of the government to protect the integrity of the elections of its own officials is inherent and has been recognized and affirmed by re peated declarations of the supreme court. There Is no enemy of free gov ernment more dangerous and none so Insidious as tbe corruption of the elect orate. No oue defends or excuses cor ruption. aud It would seem to follow that none would oppose vigorous meas ures to eradicate it I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and corruption In federal elec tions. Tbe details of such a law may be safely left to the wise discretion of the congress, but It should go as far as under the constitution It is possible to go and should include severe penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe intended to influence his act or opinion as an elector and provisions for the publication not only of tbe expend itures for nominations and elections of all candidates, but also of all contribu tions received and expenditures made by political committees." I desire to repeat this recommenda tion. All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any po litical purpose should be forbidden law, directors should not be permit ten to use stockholders' money for such purposes, aud. moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be. as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts Tlie Hnvue Conference. The first ^conference of nations held at The Hague in 1800, being unable to dispose of all the business before it. recommended the consideration aud settlement of a number of important questious by another conference to be called subsequently and at an early date. These questions were the follow ing: (li The rights and duties of neu trals (2i the limitation of the armed forces on land and sea and of military budgets (3) the use of new types and calibers of military and naval guns (4) the Inviolability of private property at sea In times of war (5) the bombard ment of ports, cities and villages by na val forces. In October, 1904, at the lu stance of the Interparliamentary union. 1 issued Invitations to all the powers signatory to The Hague convention to send delegates to such a conference and suggested that it be again held at The Hague. From all the powers acceptance was received, coupled in some cases with the condition that we should wait until the end of the war then waging be I tween Russia and Japan. The emperor! of Russia, immediately after the treaty of peace which so happily terminated this war, in a note presented to the president on Sept. 13 took the Initiative in recommending that the conference be now called. The United States gov eminent in response expressed its cor dial acquiescence and stated that it would as a matter of course take part In the new conference and endeavor to further its aims. We assume that all civilized governments will support tbe movement and that the conference is now an assured fact.. This government will do everything in Its power to se cure the success of the conference to the end that substantial progress may be made in the cause of international peace, justice and good will. Monroe Doctrine. There are certain esseutial points which must never be forgotten as re gards the Monroe doctrine. In the first place, we must as a nation make It 'ev ident that we do not Intend to t^eat it in any shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at the ex pense of the republics to the south. "st But we must make it evident that we do not intend to permit the Mouroe doc trine to be used by any nation on this continent as a shield to protect it from the consequences of Its own misdeeds against foreign nations. The Monroe doctrine does not force us to interfere to prevent the punishment of a port save to see that the punishment does not assume the form of territorial occu pation in any shape. The case is more difficult when it refers to a contractual obligation. This country would cer tainly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt. On the otber hand, it is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to take possession, even tempo rarily, of well as tice. iTtmes-lleimhlicari Jaws,: Jlenimtar 5. 1903: tbe custom houses of an American republic in order to enforce the payment of Its obligations, for such temporary occupation migbt turn into a permanent occupation. The only es cape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must ourselves undertake to bring about some arrange ment by which so much as possible of a just obligation shall be paid. To do so insures the defaulting re public from having to pay debts of an improper character under duress, while it also Insures honest creditors of the republic from being passed by in tbe Interest of dishonest or grasping cred itors. Moreover, for the United States to take such a position offers tbe only possible way of Insuring us against a clash with some foreign power. The position is therefore in the interest of peace aa in tbe interest of jus­ Santo Domingo. Santo Domingo has now made an ap peal to us, and not only every principle of wisdom, but every generous instinct witbln us, bids us respond to the ap peal. The conditions in Santo DomlngS bave for a number of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago all society was on the verge of dissolution. Fortunately just at this time a ruler sprang up in Santo Domingo who, with bis colleagues, saw tbe dangers threat ening their country and appealed to the friendship of the only neighbor wbo possessed the power and the will to help them. There was imminent dan ger of foreign intervention. The pa tience of foreign creditors bad become exhausted, and at least two foreign na tions were on the point of intervention and were only prevented by the unoffi cial assurance of this government that It would itself strive to help Santo Domingo in her hour of need. Accordingly, the executive depart ment of our government negotiated a treaty under which we are trying to help the Dominican people to straight en out their finances. This treaty is pending before the senate. In the meantime a temporary arrangement has been made under which tbe Domin ican government has appointed Amer icans to all tbe important positions in the customs service, and they are see ing to tbe honest collection of the rev enues, turning over 45 per cent to the government for running expenses and putting the other 55 per cent into a safe depositary for equitable division in case' the treaty shall be ratified among tbe various creditors, whether European or American. Under the course taken stability and order and all the benefits of peace are at last coming to Santo Domingo, dan ger of foreign intervention has been suspended, and there is at last a pros pect that all creditors will get justice, no more and no less. If the arrange ment is terminated by the failure of the treaty chaos will follow, and sooner or later this government may be in volved in serious difficulties with for eign governments over the Island or else may be forced Itself to intervene In the Island in some unpleasant fash- Army and Jtavy. ..'fe? I do not believe by tbat any army In the world has a better average of enlisted man or a better type of Junior officer, but tbe army should be trained to act effectively in a mass. Provision should be made 'by sufficient appropriations for maneuvers of a practical kind. Provision should be made for the pro motion of exceptionally meritorious meu over the heads of their comrades and for the retirement of all men who have reached a given age without get ting beyond a given rank. There should be an increase In the coast artillery force so that our coast fortifications can be in some degree adequately manned. There is special need for an increase and reorganization of the medical department of the army, lu both the army and navy there must be the same thorough training for duty In the staff corps as in the fighting line. The importance of this was shown con clusively in the Spanish-American and the Russo-Japanese wars. The work of the medical departments In the Jap anese army and navy is especially worthy of study. Our navy must, relatively to the na vies of other nations, always be of greater size than our army. We have most wisely continued for a uumber of years to build up our navy, and it has now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency. This standard must not only be maintained, but increased. It does not seem to me necessary, bow ever, that the navy should, at least in the Immediate future, be increased be yond the present uumber of units. What is now clearly necessary Is to substitute efficient for inefficient units as the latter become worn out or as it becomes apparent that they are use less. Probably the result would be attained by adding a single battleship to our navy each year, the superseded or outworn vessels being laid up or broken up as they are thus replaced. Naturalisation. On this subject I recommend First.—A federal bureau of naturali zation. to be established in the depart ment of commerce and labor, to su pervlse the administration of the natu ralizatlon laws and to receive returns of naturalizations pending and accorn pllshed. Second.—Uniformity of naturalization certificates, fees to be charged, and procedure. Third.—More exacting qualifications for citizenship. Fourth.—The preliminary declaration of intention to be abolished and no alien to be naturalized until at least ninety days after the filing of his peti tion. Fifth. Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to be confined to United States district courts and to such state courts as have jurisdiction in civil actions in which the amount in controversy is un limited in cities of over 100.000 inhab itants the United States district courts to have exclusive jurisdiction in the naturalization of the alien residents of such cities. Criminal Lavs. In my Inst message I asked tbe at tention of the congress to tbe urgent need of action to make our criminal law tpore effective, and I most ear nestly, request tbat you pay heed to tie report of tbe attorney general on this subject There seems to be no statute of the United States which provides for the punishment of a United States attor ney or other officer of the government who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrain from doing any act when tbe consideration for such corrupt agreement is other than one possessing money value. This ought to be remedied by appropriate legislation. Legislation should also be enacted to cover explicitly, unequivocally and be yond question breach of trust In the shape of prematurely divulging official secrets by an officer or employee of the United States and to provide a suitable penalty therefor. Merchant Marine. To tbe spread of our trade in peace aud tbe defense of our flag in war a great and prosperous merchant marine Is indispensable. We should ha4re ships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral rqarkets and In case of need to re-enforce our battle line. It cannot but be a source of regret and uneasiness to us tbat tbe lines of communication with our sister republics of South America should be chiefly under foreign control. It is not a good thing tbat American merchants and manufacturers should have to send their goods and letters to South Amer ica via Europe If they wish security and dispatch Even on tbe Pacific, where our ships bave held their owe better than on the Atlantic, our mer chant flag tfc now threatened through the liberal aid bestowed by other gov ernments on their own steam lines. I ask your earnest consideration of tbe report with which the merchant ma rine commission has followed its long and careful inquiry. It Is a matter of unmixed satisfac tion once more to call attention to tbe excellent work of tbe pensloD bureau, for the veterans of the civil war have a greater claim upon us than any other class of our citizens. To them first of all among our people honor is due Immigration. As I said In my last message to the congress, we cannot have too much Immigration of the right sort, and we should have none whatever of the Wrong sort. The questions arising In connection tvith Chinese immigration stand by ibemselves. The conditions in China '.re such that the entire Chinese cooly class—that is, the class of Chinese la borers, skilled and unskilled legiti mately come under the head of unde sirable immigrants to this country. But in the effort to carry out the pol icy of excluding Chinese laborers, Chi nese coolies, grave injustice and wrong have been done by tbis nation to the people of China and therefore ultimate ly to this nation itself. Chinese stu dents, business and professional men of all kinds, not ouly merchants, but bankers, doctors, manufacturers, pro fessors, travelers and the like, should be encouraged to come here and treat ed on precisely tbe same footing that we treat students, business men, trav elers and tbe like of otber nations. Aa a people-weka-ve talked much of the open door In China, and we expect, and quite rightly intend to insist upon, Justice being shown us by the Chinese. But we cannot expect to receive equity unless we do equity. Tlie Civil Service. Heads of executive departments and members of the commission have call ed my attention to the fact that the rule requiring a filing of charges and three days' notice before an employee could be separated from the service for inefficiency has served no good pur pose whatever. Experienoe has shown that the rule is wholly ineffective to save any man if a superior for im proper reasons wishes to remove him and is mischievous because it some times serves to keep in the service in competent men not guilty of specific wrongdoing. Having these facts in view, the rule has been amended by providing tbat where the Inefficiency or incapacity comes within the personal knowledge of the head of a department the removal may be made without no tice, the reasons therefor being filed and made record of the department. The absolute right of removal rests where it always has rested, with the bead of a deparftaent. The change Is merely one of procedure. It was much needed, and it is producing good re sults. Our copyright laws need revision. Philippine* and Other Island*. During (he last year the Philippine Islands have been slowly• recovering from the series of disasters which since American occupation have greatly re duced the amount of agricultural prod ucts below what was produced In Span ish times. The agricultural conditions of the Is lands enforce more strongly than ever the argument In favor of reducing the tariff on the products of the Philippine Islands entering the United States. I earnestly recommend that tbe tariff now imposed by the Dlngley bill upon the products of the Philippine Islands be entirely removed, except the tariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff be reduced to 25 per cent of the present rates under the Dingley act that after July 1. 1900. the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced In the Philippine Islands be entirely removed and that free trade between tbe islands and the United States in the products of each country then be provided for by law. In my Judgment, immediate steps should be taken for the fortification of Hawaii. This is the most important point In the Pacific to fortify in order to conserve the Interests of this coun try. It would be hard to overstate the importance of this need. Hawaii is top heavily taxed. Laws should be enact ed setting aside for a period of, say. twenty years 75 per cent of the internal revenue and customs receipts from Ha wail as a special fund to be expended In the islands. I earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitly confei American citizenship on all citizens ol Porto Rico. I wish also to call tbe attention ol the congress to one question which af fects our Insular possessions generally namely, the need of an Increased lib erality in the treatment of the whole franchise question in these islands. I earnestly ask. tbat Alaska be given an elective delegate. Admission to Statehood. I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admitted as one state and tbat New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one state. The Panama Canal. A Active work in canal construction, mainly preparatory, has been In prog ress for less than a year and a half. During that period two points about the canal have ceased to be open to debate. First, the question of route second, the question of feasibility. The point which remains unsettled Is wheth er the canal shall be one of several locks above sea' level or at sea level with a single tide lock. On this point 1 hope to lay before the congress at an early day the findings of the advisory board of American and European en gineers. In addition to sanitating tbe isthmus, satisfactory quarters are being provid ed for employees and an adequate sys tem of supplying them with wholesome food at reasonable prices has been cre ated. Hospitals have been established and equipped that are without superi ors of their kind anywhere. During the past year a large portion of tbe plant with which the work is to be done has been ordered. It is confident ly believed that by the middle of the approaching year a sufficient propor tion of this plant will bave been in stalled to enable us to resume the work of excavation on a large scale. What Is needed now and without de lay is an appropriation by the congress to meet tbe current and accruing ex penses of tbe commission. Tbe first appropriation of 510,000,000 out of the 1135,000,000 authorized by the Spoone: act was made three years ago. It is nearly exhausted. Unless the congress shall appropriate before that time all work must cease. [In conclusion the president recom mends an Increase in tbe diplomatic and consular service and more ad equate compensation of its members.] Iwreplus And DmtlW.
