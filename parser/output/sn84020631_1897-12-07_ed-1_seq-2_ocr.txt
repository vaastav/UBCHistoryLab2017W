A speedy change iu officials at the ter ritorial penitentiary will be conducive to the pnblio interests. The people of the great west do not hold the same opinion on the Chinese system of civil service, as President Mo Kinley has, bat then yon oan't expect all the people to be of one mind. The dear girls of Greater New York carry very floe collections of stcffed birds on their hats and bonnets this season and the dime museums and the Zoologi cal sooiety of Gotham are envious and jealous. Tee people of the Santa Fe and Espa nola valleys mast wake up and be doing. With a proper effort on their part the erection of a beet sugar faotory in this oity will beoome an accomplished faot within a year. The shortest and unrest way to keep a husband at home comes from smoky Pittsburg. A woman there shot her hus band in the leg in older to keep him at home. Must have wanted the man's oompany mighty bad. One man who firmly believes that prosperity is abroad in the land is Mr. Blaoohe E. Bruce of. Mississippi, who has recently been appointed register of the United States treasury, a very nice and fat job. New Mexico is coining rapidly to the iront asjt Treat fruit oountry, and iu five yearfew Mexioo will have a half dozen tt sugar faotories in aotive operation and will be a large producer of beet sugar. New Mexioo is all right. The Boston people, in the reoent Dem ocratic primaries, turned down George Fred Williams' candidate for mayor, Mr. Riley. This Mr. Riley, who is a strong free silver man, is not as popular a man as Mr. Riley in the song. The Silver City Enterprise claims that Grant county is "the wickedest county" in New Mexioo on account of the many murders oommitted within its borders. The other oounties, as far as heard from, are not disposed to dispute this claim to a unique distinction. The wages of the Missouri Pacifio eys tern employes have been restored to what they were before 1896. There may be an ulterior motive in George GouldV fiction and the pops and the free silver people may look upon it with suspicion but the employes, who are being bene' fited by the restoration, will take their inoreased wages and ask no further qaes tions. The bureau of immigration should prepare and have in readiness for dis tribution at the Omaha exposition an edition of a pamphlet of the resources of New Mexioo from agricultural, hortionl tural, olimatio, stook-raUiog and mineral standpoints, of at least 100,000 copies. The literature distributed at the Nashville exposition did great good and is doing great good and atill more of benefit to the territory can be accomplished in this way at the Omaha exposition.

AMERICA TROUBLING EUROPE. The tariff policy of this oountry and the growth of its foreign trade has of late been brioging to the surface a consider able discontent ou the part of English and continental statesmen. The Auatro Hungarian minister of foreign affairs has delivered himself of the opiuion that European states must combine against "transatlantic competition." His warn ing probably had referenoe not only to the United States bat to South America as well, and had reference probably more par ticularly to the great expansion of agri cultural productioa over here, flis prop osition is not altogether favorably re ceived. "The people of Europe who absolutely need for their daily bread the oereals of America, India and Australia," says the Yolks Zeitnng, "woold have to sacrifice untold millions at the altar of international egrarianism." The propo sition comes singularly inopportune, at a moment, in faot, when the abnndanoe of American food stuffs has spared European consumers an era of famine pnoes for bread and meat. Utteranoea of similar import, though referring spe cially to our manufacturing possibilities, have aUo been made by the president of the British board of trade. Although the possibility of competition on the part of the United States with English industry has been generally recognized as grow, ing, yet the impulse whioh our growth of manufacturing exports haB lately re ceived is attributed to the disabling labor difficulties which have worried English business enterprises for some time. The Spectator, commenting upon this matter, speculates on the probability of European artisans of the 20th oentury having insufficient work, while trans- ooeania will not only feed but will under sell Europe in all the staple industries. The economic pressure whioh these ob servers are now expecting if they should evolve eventually may bring this oountry into those very entangling allianoes whioh onr earliest statesmen feared. Bat the safety of the United States lies in the faot that the people, bb a rale, are slow to move, always grasp the situation in time to save the nation, and in prompt, ener getio aotion avert what to other nations would prove a dire calamity. Europe may be troubled by Amerioa, but Amer ioans are not in the least worried over the outcome. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President McKinley's first annual mes sage, whioh was read to congress and made public on yesterday, covered many points of vital interest to the oountry at large, and is oertainly a conservative, oonoise and businesslike doonment. Iu regard to the finanoes of the oountry, the president is extremely anxious that every dollar of the circulating medium shall be as good as the best, and that the present standard of value shall be main tained in every commercial center of the world. In order to do this he suggests that the greenback be oonverted into a reoeipt for gold, and when once redeemed in that metal, to be paid out again only in exchange for gold. In this manner the moch talked of "endless ohain" will be done away with and the treasury proteot ed against a drain that now depletes it in times of panio and flnanoial depression. This reoommendation will probably raise a howl from the free silver extremists, but it is in the line of safety and good business judgment, and under the existing conditions oannot injure the cause of bimetallism in the least. Bis recommendations on the Cuban question are prompted by a spirit of fairness towards a friendly nation, and, while they do not oommtt this govern' ment to any settled policy in dealing with that island, leave the way open to each interference or measures looking to tbe freedom of the Cubans as mBy be deemed best in the future. That the president did not take a more outspoken position on this question may cause disappointment in some quarters there is no doubt, bat it is often best to make baste slowly in mat ters of importance and that is the attitude ooonpied by Mr. MoKinley on the Cuban war. There is no misunderstanding the president's position regarding the Ha waiian islands, and his desires in that particular will be carried oat at the earliest possible moment. The islands will be annexed without oaasing any fnotion with other nations and the United States will thus aoquire valuable possessions in the Pacifio that will prove of benefit in many, ways, giving coaling stations for wAr vessels, furnishing many products for consumption in this oountry that cannot be produoed here, and open ing a large trade for Amerioan goods and produoe, - On tbe oivil service question Mr. Mo Eioley takes a etand that will not meet the approval of the greater part of the Republican party. The theory of oivil servios may be all right so long as it is nothing bat theory, bat its applios' tion in its present form is a disappoint ment. This faot has been, reooguized by the moBt able men in the country, and is fast beooming widespread. Congress should pat a stop to any further spread of the mngwnmpian and Chinese oivil servioe by refusing to appropriate a oent for its administration. In regard to home matters the message makes many thoughtful and benefloial recommendations, whioh will undoubted ly command tbe oarefal attention of ooDgreas. The foil effects of the message oannot, of oourse, be realized unless both branohes of oongress give tbe president a hearty support In bis efforts to oarry uot the designs of the administration, and there is reason to believe soon will be the oase in several instances, and that many of his recommendations will be heeded by oongress. 

JOHN 8. CLARK FOR SUPERINTENDENT. The Hon. John 8. Clark of East Las Vegas, was in Demlng the other day. It is reported that he was in that town to look over the custom boose to see if he bad not rather attend to that business in stead of taking obarge of the penitentiary. There are so many Democrats in the peni tentiary that all tbe Democratic poli ticians in the territory are using every effort to have Colonel Bergmsnn retained ae superintendent.

Never in its history has San Juan conn ty, N. M., had brighter prospects than at the present time. A number of enter prises have been projeoted whioh, if suo oesafnlly oarrled out, will make this the most popolous and prosperous county in all New Mexico. Capitalists have been here and several are now iu the field for the purpose of building two immense ir rigating canals whioh when completed will water between 76,000 and 100,000 acres of fertile land; a large flouring mill of whioh C. N. Ttew of Wisconsin, will be proprietor, will soon be in oourse of ereo tion a abort distanoe below Aztec; money, material and labor nearly sufficient to build a substantial bridge across the Animas river at Azteo has been subscribed and at this writing it is fully expeoteri that the same will be in use by the pub lio on February 1. This bridge has long been needed and when completed will be found to benefit the people of every por tion of the county. The Index is not pessimistic in its views, neither does it wish to publish that which is Dot true. The indications are, at this time, that one or both of the above mentioned irrigat ing oaoals will be oonstruoted, following which will be a three-fold increase of onr population.

TURNING OUT SUGAR. Three Hundred and Fifty-seven Hacks In S84 Honrs Mix Carloads Heat Out This Week, Everything continues to ran along with tbe same smoothness and ease that have characterized the operations of the sugar faotory sinoe the opening day of the cam paign.

The factory is gaining a little on t&i- Bupply of beets, the daily supply of whiob is now about 150 tons.

She Is Interested In tbe Legal Status of Angels and Bothers l' a. The judge's daughter was in one of her thoughtful moods, und the judge was naturally nervous. He knew what those moods portonded, for bad he not been tripped up as a result of them ou previous ocoasions? "Papa," she said at last, "I wish you would enlighten me in regard to a little legal problem that has been both ering me for some time. " The judge sighed and put down his paper. "What is it?" he asked. "It's the case of this Miss Tilling hast, the artist, who undertook to put some stained glass angels in a memorial window and who has had to sue for the oontract price of the work," explained the judge's daughter. "It's a straight case of law," said the judge to himself with some jubila tion, for he could answer about any thing in the legal line that didn't have snarls in it. Then he asked : " What is there about it that puzzles you? If sho has a contract, it ought to be a very sim ple" "Oh, she has the contract all right enough, " interrupted the judge's daugh ter, "but I am not ouite sure about the interpretation of it That's why I have j come to you. Of course you know every thing that there is to know about law, and what is so blind and confusing to me will be a mere trifle to you. You see, the contract called for an angel, but the figure Miss Tillinghast put in the window has no wings, and it is for that reason that payment has been refused. Naturally the whole question hinges on whether the law recognizes angels with or without wings. Is a wingless augol lawful, or does the supreme court recog nize only the winged variety? Is it pos sible to produce any authentio record of an angel without wings? Would one have any standing in court? And, on the other hand, have we any evidence that a real angel has wings? Of course that is the supposition, but would you as a presiding judge in a case of this sort feel that you were justified in ac cepting wings as established beyond a reasonable doubt?" The judge's daughter paused and looked at the judge inquiringly. The judge puffod his cigar with unnecessary energy and looked at his daughter. "Isn't that the only question at issue in this case?" demanded the judge's daughter, and the judge nodded. " Well, then?" she persisted and wait ed for him to answer. "Well, then," he said slowly after a minute of thought, "I am of the opin ion that the evidence in this case shows that you are going to make things mighty interesting for some young man at some future time. " Then the judge went up stairs and told his wife that he didn't care how soon their daughter married. Chicago Post Regret. - "And to think I blew me last nickel on her only dis niornin."
