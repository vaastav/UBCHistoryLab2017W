The message of President Roosevelt, read at the opening of congress today, and published in full in today'8 issue of the Pioneer, is# a document which Will add both to the president's reputation as a tireless agitator o" reform, and to his reputation as a writer. It. deals with a variety of pertinent subjects with intelligent minuteness, and at the same time possesses a rare literary style. To the man who is interested in the affairs of the nation, it will repay a careful reading, and even those who have neither the time nor the inclination to pursue the twenty-seven columns to the end, will find a reading of selected parts of the message of immense value and interest. The first subject taken up by the president, and to which he devotes but a paragraph, is cor poration contributions to cam paign funds, and he recommends the passage of a law forbidding the giving of money to any party by any corporation. He then discusses at length the question of the government's right of ap peal in criminal cases, which he strongly urges congress to make possible, and the question of in junctions, which has been raised as an issue by the labor organiza tions. From this the president passes to the subject of lynching and the race problem in the south. He deplores mob action and finds a remedy for negro crimes in "swift, relentless and orderly punishment under the law," and in the elevation of the black race by extending the education privileges, which it uow enjoys in a small measure. William R. Hearst, late candi" date for governor of New York, comes in for some scathing re bukes under the topic of capital and labor, and although the president strikes with padded gloves, in that he does not men tion his name, the blows are aimed at the yellow editor never theless. He says: In dealing with both labor and capital, the questions affecting both corporations and trades unions, there is one matter more important to remember than aught else, and that is the in finite harm done by preachers of mere discontent. The plain people who think,the mechanics, farmers, merchant?, workers with head or hand, the men to whom American tradi tions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their, neighbors, owe it to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be given popular government is to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. The president's views on cor porations might be summed up by saying that he favors com bination of capital, but believes that the government should pre vent the evils that flow from too much combination, by strict con trol and supervision. After pro posing a control that will prevent over-capitalization and kindred evils, the president says: The actual working of our laws has shown that the effort to pro hibit all combination, good or bad, is noxious, where it is not ineffective. Combination of capi tal, like combination of labor, is a necessary element of our pres ent industrial system. What we need is not vainly to try to prevent all combination, but to secure such rigorous and adequate control and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their injuring the public, or ex isting in such form as inevitably to threaten injury. Another topic on which Presi dent Roosevelt grows eloquent is the inability to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties, as was recently brought forcibly to the attention of the country at San Francisco, when the local author ities shut the Japanese children from the public school?, and the national government found itself helpless to enforce the rights of the Japanese under treaty. 

LAWS fi.ting the case and all similar THE BEM1DJI DAILY PIONEER. TUESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 4, 1WX, ctses that may arise, are recom mended. The message takes up and treats in turn, and at length such important problems of the day as the divorce evil and the neces sity of a uniform national divorce law currency reform an income and an inheritance tax farming as a profession the Philippine tariff and the urgency of a lower rate, or absolute free trade with our island possessions Cuban intervention and Secretary Root's recent trip to South America and the need of better trade relations with the Latin re publics, i The president also speaks of our navy and says he favors not increasing the navy but the main taining of it at its present size by the continual building of new ships to replace old and wornout ones. As to his Panama trip, from which he has just returned, President Roosevelt promises a full report later. President's Message, pages 3,4, 5, 6, & 8. A. C.
