RECOMMENDED. Railroad Land Grants Discouraged. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.1870. 7b fAe Smote and House of Represen iatives. A year of peace and general prosper ity to this nation baa passed nuce the ljiat assemblage of Cod? re. We have, through a kind Providence, been blesd with abundant crop, and Lav bean spared from complications and war with foreign nations. In our midst comparative harmony has been restored. It is to be regretted, howev er, that a fre exercise cf the elective franchise baa, b7 violence and intimi dation, been denied to citizen., In ex ceptional cases, and several of the States lately in rebellion, and the ver dict of the people has thereby been re versed. The States or Virginia and iliasissippi have been restored to rep resentation in national council. Georgia is the only State now without representation, and may confidently be expected to take her place there, also, at the beginning of the new year, and then, let us hope, will b com Dieted the work of reconstruction, witn an acaaieseenoe on the part of the whole people in the national obli gation to pay the public dubt created as the price of our Union; the pen sions to our disabled soldier and sai lors, and their widows and orphans, and in the changes to the Coustitu tion whicU have been made necessary Y, a great rebellion. There is no reason why we should not advance in material prosperity and happiness, as no other nation did, after so protracted and devastating a war. THE WAR IN EUROPE. Boon after the existing war broke out in Europe, the protection of the United States Minister in Paris was Invoked in favor of North Germans domiciled in French territory. In tractions were Issued to grant the protection. This has been followed by an extension of American protec tion to citizens of Saxony, Hesse and 6axe Coburg, Gotha, Columbia, Por tugal, Uruguay,the .Dominican tteptiD lic, Equador, Chili, Paraguay and Venezeula. In Paris the charge wax an onerous one, requiring constant and severe labor, as well as the exer cise of patience, prudence and good Judgment. It has been performed to the entire satisfaction of this govern ment, and, as I am offlc'ally inform ed, equally so to the satisfaction of the Government of North Germany. As soon as I learned that a republic had been proclaimed at Paris, and that the people of France had acqui esced in the change, the minister of the United States was directed by tel egraph to recognize it, and tender my congratulations and those of the peo ple of the U n i ted States. The re-establishment in France of a system of government disconnected with the dynastic traditions of Eu rope appeared to be a proper subject for the felicitation of Americans. Should the present struggle result in attaching the hearts of the French to our simple forms of representative government, it will be a subject of still further satisfaction to our people, While we make no effort to impose our institutions upon the inhabitants of other countries, and while we ad here to our traditional neutrality in foreign civil contests, we cannot be indifferent to the spread of American political ideas in a great and highly civilized country like France. We were asked by the new government to ue our good offices jointly with those of European powers in the in terest of peace. Answer was made that the established policies and the true interests of the United St-ate for bade thera to Interfere in European powers. I ascertained, informally and unofficially, that the government of North Germany was not then dis posed to listen to such representations from any powers: aad. thoueh ear nestly wishing to see the blessings of peace restored to the belligerents, wiih all of whom the United State are on terms of friendship, I declined, on the part of this eovernment, to take a step which could onlv result in injury to our true interests without advancing the object for which our Intervention was invoked. Should the time come when the ac tion of the United States can hasten the return of peace by a single hour. that action will be heartily taken. I deemed it prudent, in view of the nnraoeroi persons or German ani French birth living in the United States, to issue, soon after an official notice of a state of war had been re ceived from both bellig?rents, a proe lamation defining the duties of the United States Deutral and the obliir- tlons of persons residing within the territory to observe their laws and the laB of nations. The proclama tion was followed ny others, as cir cumstances seemed to call for them. The people, thus acquainte-1 in ad vance of their duties and obligations, have assisted In Dreventinir anr viola tions of the neutrality of the United ctates. 

CUBA AND SPAIN. It Is not understood that the condi tion of the insurrection of Cuba ha materially changed since the cl'we or the last session or Coneress. In an early stage of the contest the Spanish authorities inaugurated a system of arbitrary arrests.of close confinement. of military trials and execution o persons suspected of complicity with the insurgents, and summary emhareo or their properties and sequestration of their revenue by executive warrant. Such proceedings, so far as they ef fected tne person or property or citi sens of the United States, were in violation of the provisions of th- treaty of 1795, between the United States and Spain. Representations of lniunes resulting to several person ciaiminn to De citizens or the United States, by reason of such violations, were made to the Spanish Govern ment from April, 1869, to June last The Spanish minister at Washington had been clothed with a limited pow er to aid in redressing such wrongs. That power was found to be with . drawn in view, it was said, of the fs yorsWe situation in which the Island rf Cuba then was. which however, did not lead to revolution or suspen sion of the extraordinary and arbi trary functions exercised by the ex ecutive power in Cuba, and we ware blleed to make our complaint at Madrid. In the negotiations thu opened and still pendine there, the United States only claimed that for the future the rights secured to their citizens by treaty should be respected in Cub, and that as to the past, a Joint tribunal should he established In the United Stat, with full jurisdic tion over all such claims. Before such an impartial tribunal each claimant would he required to prove bis case; on the other hand bpain would be at liberty to traverse very material fact, and thus a com plete equity would be done. A case which at one time threatened serious ly to affect the relations between the United States and Spain has already been disposed of in this way. The claim of Colonel Lloyd Aspinwall for the illegal seizure and detention of that vessel was referred to arbitration by mutual consent, and has resulted In an award to the United States for the owners of the same of $19,702 60 in gold. Another and long pending claim of like nature, that of the whale hip Canada, has been disposed of by friendly arbitration. Durinz the pres ent year it was referred, by joint con sent, to tne decision or Kir Edward Thornton, her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Washington, who kindly undertook the laborious task of exam ining the voluminous mass of corre spondence and testimony submitted by the two governments, and award ed to the United States the sum of iuu,74U 09 in gold, which lias since been paid by that government. These recent examples show that the mode which the United States have proposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasi ble, and that it may be agreed to by either nation without dishonor. It is to be hoped that this moderate de mand may oe acceeded to without further delay. Should the pending negotiations unfortunately and unex pectedly be without result, it will then become my duty to communicate that fact to Congress, and await its action on the subject. SPAIN AND THE SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS. The long deferred peace conference between Spain and the South Ameri- can Republics ba been inaugurated r, the United .States pursuant to the rec- ommendation eonuiued in the ro- i.,t;.r, f ir.., , i)...M,.f;. outheKth of LWmber, The executive department of the trovero- mentotleroa its friend, v offices lor the promotion of peace and harmony between Spain and the allied repub- lien.

Ultimately however, a conference wa arranged and w opened in this citvonthe 2nh of October Isrt, at which I authorized the riecreUry -as attend! bv lin Peru, rhiii 'uence of the State to proide.

The time is probably not far distant when In the natural course of events the European political connection with this continent will cease. Our policy should be shaped In view of this prob ability so as to ally the commercial interests of the Spanish American States more closely to our own, and thus give the United states ail tne preeraii-ence and an tne advantage wnicn Mr. avonroe, air. wiuii uu Mr. Clay contemplated when they proposed to join the Congress of Panama. THE SAN DOMINGO TREATY. Ilurinir the last session of Congress a treaty for the annexation of the re- ... . . . . T - ' . . .1 public or sjn uomingo w iue nmru States failed to receive the requisite two thirds vote of the Senate. I was thoroughly convinced then that the best interests of the country, commer cially, demanded its ratification. Time has only confirmed me in this view. I now flrm'y believe that the moment it is known that the United States have entirely abandoned the project of accept in e as a part of i ts ter ritory the island of San Domingo, a free port will be negotiated for by European nations. In the bay of Samana a large commercial city will spring up, to which we will be tribu tary without receiving the correspond ing benefits. The Government of San Domingo have voluntarily sought this annexation. It is a weak power, numbering probably less than 120,000 souls, and yet possessing one of the richest localities under the sun, capa ble of supporting a population of 10, 000,000 of people in luxury. The peo ple of San Domingo are not capable of maintaining themselves in their present condition, and must look for ouUide suppoit. They yearn for the firotection of our free institutions and aws. our progress and civilization. Shall we refuse them? The acquisi tion of San Domingo is desirable, be cause of its geographical position. It commands the entrance to the Carri- bean Sea. and the Isthmus transit of commerce. It possesses the richest soil, and the best and roost capacious harbors, the most salubrious climate, and the moit valuable products of the forest, mine and sou or any or the West India Islands. Its posession by the United Stotes, will, inafewyears, build up a coastwise commerce of im mense magnitude, which will go far toward restoring to us our lost mer chant marine. It will give to us those articles which we desire greatly and do not produce, thus equalizing our exports and imports. In case of foretgn war it will give us command of all the islands referred to, and thus prevent an enemy from again posses Ing himself of a rendezvous upon our coast. At present our coast trade be tween the States bordering on the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico is by the Bahamas ' and the Antillies. Twice we must, as It were pass through foreign countries to get from Oeoreia to the east coast of Florida. San Domingo, with a stable govern ment under which her immense re sources can be developed, will give re munerative wages to ten thousand la borers not now upon the island. This labor will take advantage of every available means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands and to seek the blessings of freedom and Its seq'ience. Each inhabitant receiv In gth reward of his own lab jr, Porto Rico ajd Cuba will have to abolish slavery as a measure of self-preserva tion to retain tneir laborers, ban uo- mingo will become a large consumer of the products of northern farms and manufactories. The cheap rate a' which her citizens can be furnished with food and machinery will make It necessary that co itiguous islands should have the same advantages In order to compete with'the production of sugar, coffee, tobacco and tropical fruit. &c. This will open to us a wi der market for our products. The production of our own supply of these articles will cut off more than one hundred millions of our annual im ports, besides Increasing our exports. With such a picture it Is easy to see how our large debt abroid is ultimate ly to be extinguished. With the bal ance of trade against us, including in terest of bonds held by foreigners, and money shipment for our citizens traveling in foreign lands, equal to the entire yield or precious metals in this country, It is not so easy to see how this result is to be otherwise accom plished. The acquistion of San Do mingi is In adhesion to the Monroe loctrine, and is a measure of national protection. It is asserting our just claim to a controlling influence over the great commercial traffic soon to flow from the West to the East bv the Isthmus of Darien; it is to build up our merchant marine; it Is to fur nish mw markets for the products o our farms, shops and manufactories; it is to make slavery insupportable in Cuba r.nd Porto Rico at once, and ul timately so in Brazil; it is to settle the unhappy condition of Cuba and end an exterminating conflict; it i to provide honest means of paying mr honest debts without overtaxing the people; it is to furnish our citi zens with necessaries of every day lift it cheaper rates than ever before; it s, in fine, a rapid stride tow-d the zreatness which the intelligence, in lustry aud enterprise, of the citizens f the United Slates entitle this coun try to assume among nations. In view of the importinceof this ques tion, I earnestly urge upon Congres early action expressive of its views a to the best means of acquiring San Domingo. My suggestion is that by a ioint resolution of the two House if Congress, the Executive be author ized to appoint a commission to neg oliate for a treaty with the authori tiesof San Domingo for the acquisit ion of that island, and that an appro priation be made to defray the expen es of such commission. The ques tion may then be determined by the action of the two Houses of Congress upon a resolution of annexation, as in the case of the acquisition of Texas So convinced am I of the advantage ti flow from the acquisition of San Domingo, and of the great disadvan taes I might almost say calamities- to flow from non-acquisition, that I believe the subject has only to be in vestigated to be approved. THE 

MEXICAN FREE ZONE. It is to be regretted our representa tions in regard to the injurious effect. especially upon the rcveuue of the Lnited States, oi tne policy or the Mexican government in exempting from import duties a large tract of it--territory on our borders, have not only been fruitless, but that it is even pro posed in that country to extend tlit iimits within which the privilege ad verted to has hitherto been enjoyed. l'he expediency of takiug into youi serious consideration proper mean- for countervailing the policy referred to, will, it is presumed, engaged youi earnest attention. EXTRADITION TREATIES. It is the obvious interest, especial ly of neighboring nations, to provide against immunity to those who may have committed high crimes within their borders, and who may have sought refuge abroad. For this pur pose extradition treaties have been concluded with several of the Central American Republics, and others art in progress. VENEZUELA CLAIMS. sense of Congress is desired, a early as may be convenient, upon the proceeding of the commission on claims against Venezuela, communi cated in the messages of March 4th 1S69, March 1st, 1S70, and March 31st! 1870. It has not been deemed advisa ble to distribute any of the monev which has been received from that government until Congress shall hv acted upon the subject. THE CHINESE MASSACRE. The massacre of the French and Russian residents at Thien Tsin under circumstances of great barbarity was supposed to have been premeditated, and to iudicate a purpose among the populace to exterminate foreigners in the Chinese empire. The evidence fails to establish such supposition, but shows a complicity between the local authorities and the mob. The gov ernment at Pekin, however, seems to have been disposed to fulfill its treaty obligations so far as It was able te de t ! ! . , ' I influence. Anticipating iniu. .thweau, I in-.-ited France WW; North Germany to make an au , ized eu-pen-ioti of J" oflt.it, where they were temporarily ! I ! i bo. Unfortunately the Dews of the war bet ween the uernian ."state ana France, reached China soon after th : inas-uicre. It would appear that ta . Tv.nnhr mini became & !.-'' 1 wim the idea that this contest, extending to Chinese water, would ryatraiii me cnns-uaii i"rc i- and that the time was comini? when ( t!ie supervtitio-.i might expel ' : foreigners, and re-tore -Ma"'laa" ; fu - pendcl bv act of the commander, . and to act tozether for the future pro- tection in China of the lives and prop-; erty of Americans and European, 

TREATIES WITH GREAT BRITAIN. : Since t:ie adjournment of Congress, the ratifications of the treaty with Great Britian for abolishing the mixed ijre for the suppression of fie Marr ,ra,ie have been exchanged It is I if. confined to the eastern coast of Africa whence the slaves are taken to Ara bian markets. The ratifications of the naturalization convention be tween Great Britain and the United States have also been exchanged dur ing the recess, and thus a long stand ing dispute between the two govern ments has been settled in accordance with the principles always contended for oy the United States. A BOUNDARY LINE QUESTION. In April last, while engaged in lo cating a military reservation near Pembina, a corps of engineers discov ered that the commonly received boundary line between the United States and the British possession, at that place, is about 5,703 feet south of the true position of the zenith para llel, and that the line when run on what is now supposed to be be true position of that parallel, would, leave tne fort for of the Hudson Bay Compa- nv.at Pembina, within the territory pf the United States. This information being communicated to the British government, I was requested to .cou sent, that the British occupation of the fort of the Hudson Bay Company should continue for the present. I deem it important, however, that this part of the boundary line should, tie definitely fixed by a joint commis sion of the two Governments and submit herewith estimates of the ex peine of such commission on the part of the United Stares, and recommend that an appropriation be made for that purpose. The land boundary is al ready fixed and marked from the summit of the Rocky Mountains to the.Georgian Bay. It should now be in like manner mirked from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains. THE ALABAMA CLAIMS. I regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment of the claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted by that government during the rebellion. The cabinet of London, so far as its view have been expressed, does not appear to be willing to concede that Her Majesty's government was guil ty of neglieenee, or did, or permitted any act during the war by which the United States has just cause of com plaint. Our firm and unalterable con victions are directly the reverse. I therefore recommend to Congress to authorize the appointment of a Com mission to take proof of the amounts and the ownership of these claims on notice being given to the represent atives of Her Majesty at Washington, and that authority be given for the settlement of these claims by the United States, so that the government shall have the ownership of the pri vate claims as well as the responsible control of all demands against Great Britain. It cannot be necessary to add that whenever her majesty's gov ernment shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims the United States will enter upon their consideration with an ear nest desire for a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both nations. THE FISHERIES DISPUTE. The course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward the fishermen of the United States during the past sea son has not been marked by a friendly feeling. By the first article of the convention of 1818 between Great Britain and the Uuited States, it was agreed that the inhabitants of the United States should have forever, in common with British subjects, the right of taking fish in certain waters therein defined. In the waters not iu cluded in the limits named in the con vention, within three miles of the ports of the British coast, it has been the custom of many years to give Intruding fisherman of the United States a reasonable warning of their volation of the technical rights cf Great Britain. The English govern ment is understood to have delegated the whole or a share of its jurisdiction or control of these inshore fishing grounds to the colonial authority known as the Dominion of Canada, and this semi-independent but irres ponsible agent has exercised its dele gated powers in an unfriendly way. Vessels have been seized without no tice or warning, io violation of the custom previously prevailing and have been taken into the colonial ports, their voyages broken up and the vessels condemned. There is reason to believe that this unfriendly aud vexatious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon the hardy fisher men of the United States, with a view to political effect upon this iovernmenL The ftatues of the D m inion of Canada assume a still broad band more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the United States. They authorize officers or persons to bring vessels within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors of Canada, into pDrt, to search their cargo, to exam ine the matter on oath touching the cargo and voyage, and to inflict upon lim a heavy pecuniary penalty if true answers are not given ; and if such a vessel is found preparing to fish within three marine miles of any such joasts, bays, creeks or harbors with ut a liceuse, or after the expiration f the period named in the last license rranted to it, they provide the vessel, with her tackle, &c, shall be forfeit ed. It is not known that any con demnations have been made under this statute. Should the authorities ifCafiaJa attempt to enforce it, it ivill become my duty to take such steps as may be necessary to protect the rights of the citizens of the United States. It has been claimed by her Majesty's officers that fishing vessels if the United States have no right to euter the open ports of the British possessions in North America, except 'or the purposes of shel ter a nd repai ring 1 images, of purchasing wood and ob taining water; that they have no right to enter at the British custom houses jr to trade except for the purchase of rood and waitr, and that they must lepart within twentv-four hours af ter notice to leave. It is not known that any seizure of a fishing vessel carrying the flag of the United States tas been made under this claim. So far as the claim is founded on an al leged construction of the convention flS18, it cannot be acquiesced in by the United States. It is hoped that it will not be insisted on by her Majes ty's government. During the confer ences which produced the negotiation of the convention of 1813, the British minister proposed to expressly exclude the fishermen of the United States from the privilege of carrying on trade with any of his Britannic Ma jesty's subjects residing within the limits assigned for their use, and also that it should not be lawful .for the vessels of the United States engaged in such fishery to have on board any joods, wares or merchandise whatev r, except such as may be necessary for the prosecution of th.-ir voyage to ind from such fishing grounds, and any vessel of the United States which shall contravene this regulation cuay be seized, condemned, and confiscated ith her cargo. This proposition, which is identical with the construc tion now put upon the language of the convention, was emphatically re jected by the American commission ers, and thereupon was abandoned by the British plenipotentiaries, and Ar ticle 1 as it stands in the convention was substituted. If, however, it be said that this claim is founded on pro visional or colonial statues, and not upon the conv.-ntion, this govern ment cannot but regird them as uu friendly, and in contravention of the spirit, if not of the letter, of the trea ty, for the faithful execution of which the English government is aloue -ee- ' snnnsible. Anticipating that an at-! tempt may pibly be made by the Canadian authorities in the coming . season to repeat their nnneighborly j acta toward our fishermen, I recom- j mend you to confer upon the exeeu-1 tive the power to suspend, by procla- mation, the operation of the laws au- thorizing the transit of goods, wares and merchandize in bond across the territory of the United States to Can- ada; and further, should such aa:-ex- ireme measure become necessary, io suspend the operation of any law whereby the vessels of the dominion of Canada are permitted to enter the waters of the United States. : '. NAVIGATION OF THE ST. LAWRENCE. Alike unfriendly disposition 'has been manifested on the part of Cana-1 da in the maintenance of a claim '-of right to exclude the citizens of the Uaited States froa the BavlatioB f 0- the St. Lawrence. This river consti tutes a natural highwray to the ocean, with an aegresrate population of 17, OOj.OOO inhabitants, ad with an ag gregate tonnage of 001.307 tons upon the waters which discharge into it. The foreign commerce of our ports in tuee waters is open to British com petition. nd the major part of it is done in British bottoms. If the American seamen be excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean, the monopoly of the direct commerce of the lake ports with the Atlantic would be in foreign hand;, their ves sels on trau-Atlantic voyages havinz an access to our lake p'rts, which would be denied to American ves-els on similar voyaies. To stiite such a proposition is to r-'ute its justice. During the administration of Mr. John Q'lincy Adams, Mr. Clay un questionably demonstrated the natur al right of the citizens of t'.ie United States to tiie navigation of this river, claiming that the act of the Congress of Vienna, in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations, showed the judgment of E jrooean jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a country through which a navigable river passes have a natural right to enjoy the navigation of that river to and into the sea, even thouirh passing throu?h the territory of another pow er. This right does not exclude the co-equal right of the sovereign pos sessing the territory through which the river debouches into the sea to make such regulations relative to the policy of the navigation as may be reasonably necessary, but those regu lations should be framed in a libt-rdl spirit of comity, and should not im pose need!e9 burdens upon the com merce which has the right of transit. It has been found in practice more advantageous to arrange these regu lations by mutual agreement. The United States are ready to make any reasonable arrangement as to the policy of I he St. Lawrence which may be suggested by Great Britain. If the claim by Mr. Clay was just when the population of the States bordering on the shore of the lakes was only 3,400,000, it now derives greater force and equity from the in creased population, wealth, produc tion, and tonnage of the States on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument in behalf of our riglrt, the principle, for which he contended, has been frequently and by various nations recognized by law or by treaty, and has been extended to several other great rivers. By the treaty concluded at Mayence in 1S31 the Rhine was declared free from the point where it is first navigable into the sea. By the convention between Spain and" Portugal, concluded in 1833, the navigation of the Douro throughout the whole extent was made free for the subjects of both crowns. In 1S53 the Argentine con federation by treaty threw open the free navigation of the Parana and Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In 1S5C the Crimean war was closed by a treaty which provid ed for the free navigation of the Dan ube. In 1S5S Bolivar, by treaty, de clared that it legarded the rivers Am azon and La Plata, in accordance with the fixed principles of national law as highways or channels opened by nature for the commerce of all na t'ons. In 18o9 the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and In December 1S66, the Emperor of Brazil, by an imperial decree declared the Amazon to be open to all the frontier of Brazil and to the merchant ships of all na tions. The great st living British authority on this subject, while as serting the abstract right of the Brit ish claims, says it is difficult to deny that Great Britain may ground her refusal upon strict law, but it is equal ly difficult to deny: first tnat in so doing she exercises harshly an ex treme and hard law; secondly that her conduct with respect to the navi gation of the St. La wrencc Is in glar ing and discreditable inconsistency wh her coneuct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi. On the ground that she possessed a small domain, in which the Mississippi took its rise, she insisted on this right to navigation fie entire volume of its waters. On the ground that she pos sessed both banks of the St. 'Law reuce where it debouches into the sea she denies to the Uuited States the right of navigation, though about one-half of the. waters of Lakes On tario, Erie, Huron and Superior, and the whole of Lake Michigan through which the river flows, are the proper ty of the United StaWs. The whole nation is interested in securing cheap transportation from the agricultural States of the West to the Atlantic seaboard, to the citizens of those States. It secures a greater retarn for their labor; to the inhabitants of the seaboard it offers cheaper food ; to the nation an increase in the annual surplus of wealth. It is to be hoped that the government of Great Britain will see the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistant claim to which her Canadian provinces have urged her adherence. THE DECLINE OF AMERICAN COMMERCE. Our depressed commerce is a sub ject to which I called your special at tention nt the last session, and sug gested that we will in future have to look more to the countries south of us, and to China and Japan, for its revival. Our representatives to all these governments have exerted their influence to encourage trade lietween the Uuited State? and the countries to which they are accredited, but the fact exists that the carrying is almost entirely in foreign bottoms, and while this state of affairs exists we cannot control our due share of the commerce of the world. That between the Pa cific states and China and Jap in is about all the carrying trade now con ducted in American vessels. I wo jld recommend a liberal policy toward that line of American steamers, one that will insure its success" and more increased usefulness. The cost of building iron vessels, the only ones that can compete with foreign ships in the carrying trade, is so much greater in the Uuited States than in foreign countries that without some assistance from the government they cannot be successfully built here. There will beseveral propositions laid before Congress in the course of the present session looking to a remedy for this evil. Even if it should be at some cost to the National Treasury, I hope such encouragement will be given as will secure American ship ping on the high seas and American ship building at home. 

CARE OF THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES. The condition of the archives at the Department of State calls for an ear ly action of congress. The building now rented by that department is a frail structure at an inconvenient dis tance from the Executive Mansion and from the other departments. It is illy-adapted to the purpose for which it is used, ha3 not the capacity to accommodate the archives, uud is not fire-proof. It remite situati in, its slender construction and the ab sence of a supply of water in the neigborhood leaves but little hope of safety for either the building or its contents in case of a fire. Its destruction would involve the loss of the rolls containing the original acts and resolutions of Congress of the his toric records of the revolution and of the Confederation, of the whole series of the diplomatic and consular ar chives since the adoption of the Con stitution, and of the many other val uable records and papers left with that department when it was the priucipal depository of the govern ment archives. I racom-nnl an ap- Eropriation for the con-truction of a uilding for the Department of State. REARRANGEMENT OF DEPARTMENTS I recommend to your considera'ion the propriety of transferring to the Department of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately t be long, all power and duties in relation to the territories with which the de partment of state is now c'iarred bv law or usage, and from the Interior department to the war department, the pension bureau, so far as it regu lates the payment of soldier's pen sions. I would further recommend that the payment of na.'al pensions be transferred to one of the bureaus of the navy department, THE ESTIMATES. The estimates for the expenses of the government for the next fiscal year are 518,244,316 01 less than for the current one, but exceed appropri-1 ations for the present year for the same items, SS.972.127 M. In this es timate, however, is included $2i"'59,- 27S 37 for public works heretofore be gun under Congressional provision and of which only so much is asked as Congrcs3 may choose to give. The appropriation for the same works for the present fiscal year were $11,GS3, 519 18. THE 

RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS. j ME NTS. . j I i , j j j The average value of gold as com- j pared wiih national currency for the i whole of the yrar 1S69, was about 134, i and for eleven months of 1S70 the 1 same relative value has been about 115. The approach to a specie basis is very gratifying, but the fact cannot he denied that the instability of the value of our currency is prejudicial to our prosperity and tends to keep up prices to the detriment of trade. The evils of a depreciated and fluctuating currency are ao great that now, when the premium on gold has fallen so maeh, It would seem that the time has arrived when, by wise and pru deDt legislation. Congress should look to a policy which wouid" place our currency at par with gold at no dis tant day. "REVENUE REFORM" Tiia tax collected from the people has' been reduced more than eighty million dollars per annum. By stead iness in our present course there is no reason why, in a few short years, the national tax gatherer may not disap pear from t lie door of the citizen en tirely. With tiie revenue stamp dis pensed by postmasters in every com munity, a t;ix upon liquors of all -oris, and tobacco in all forms, and by a wise adjustment of the tariff, which will put a duty only upon those articles which we could dispense with, known as luxuries, and on those which we u-e more of than we produce revenue enough may be raised af ter a few years of ptace and conse quent reduction of indebtedness to fulfill ail our obligatio'is. A further reduction of expenses, in addition to a reduction of the interest account, may be relied on to make this prac ticable. "Revenue reform," if it means this, has my hearty support. If it implies a collection of all the revenue for the support of the government, for the payment of priucipal and interest of ihe public debt, pensions. &c, by di rectly taxing the people, then I am asrainst ''Revenue reform," and con fidently believe the people are with me. If it means failure to provide the necessary means to defray all ex penses of the government, aud there by repudiation of the public debt and pensions, then I am still more op posed to such a kind of revenue re form. Revenue reform has not been defined by any of its advocates, to my knowledge, but seems to be accepted as something which is to supply every man's wants without any cost or ef fort on his part. A true revenue re form cannot be made in a day, but must be the work of national legisla tion and of time. As soon as the rev enue can be dispensed with, all duty should be removed from coffee, tea, and other articles of universal use, not produced by ourselves. The necessi ties of the country compel us to col lect revenue from our imports. An army of assessors and collectors is not a pleasant sight to the citizens, but that, or a tariff for revenue, is neces sary. Such a tariff, so far as it acts in encouragement to home products, affords employment to labor at living wasies in contrast to the pauper labor of the old world, and also in the de velopemtnt of home resources. THE WAR 

DEPARTMENT. Under the act of Congress of the loth day of July, 1S70, the army has gradually been reduced, so that on the first of January, 1S71, the number of commissioned officers and men will not exceed the number contemplated by law. The War Department build ing is an old structure, not fire-proof and entirely inadequate in dimen sions to our present wants. Many thousands of dollars are now paid an nually for the rent of private build ings to accommodate the various bu reaus of the department. I recom mend an appropriation for a new War Department building, suitable to the present and growing wants of the.na tion. The report ot the Secretary of Was shows a very satisfactory reduc tion in the expenses of the army for the last fiscal year. For details you are referred to his accompanying report. THE 

NAVY DEPARTMENT. The expenses of the navy for the whole of lust year, f. e.. from Decem ber, 1869, the date of the last report, are less than $19,000,000, or about $1,000,000 less than they were the pre vious year. The expenses of the Navy Department in this fiscal year since July 1, show for the five mouths a de crease of over $2,400,000 from those of the corresponding months of last year. The estimates for the current vear were ?2S,205,678 3S. Those for next year nre $20,683,317, and $95,100 additional for temporary and perma nent improv -inents. 'These estimates are made cii -ely lor the mere main tenance of il.e naval establishment as it now is, without much in the nature of permanent improvement. The ap propriations made for the last aud current years were evidently intend ed by Congress and are sufficient only to keep the navy on its present foot ing, and for the repairing and refit ting of our old ships. This policy must of course gradually but surely destroy the navy and it is in itself far from economical, as each year that it is pursued the necessity forfres re pairs in ships and navy yards will be cjme more imperative and more cost ly, aud our current expenses are actu ary increased for the mere repair of ships, many of which must soon be come unseaworthy aud useless. I hope during the present session of Congress to be able to submit to it a plan by, which naval vessels can be built and repairs made with great saving upon the present cost. It can hardly be wise statesmanship in a government which represent a coun try with over five thousand miles of cost line on both oceans, exclusive of Alaska, and containing forty millions of progressive people, with relations of every nature with almost every foreign country to rest with such in adequate means of enforcing any for eign policy, either of protection or re dress. Separated by the ocean from the nations of the E istern continent, our navy is our only means of direct protection to our citizens abroad, or fjrtne enforcement of any foreign policy. THE 

POST-OFFICE. The accompanying report of the Postmaster General shows a most sat isfactory workingof that department. With the adoption of the recommen dations contained therein, particular ly those relating to a reform in the franking privilege and the adoption of correspondence cards, a self-sus-ing postal system may speedily be looked for, and at no distant day a futther reduction of the rate of post age bo attained. I recommend au thorization by Congress to the Post master General and Attorney General to issue all commissions to officials ap pointed through their respective de partments. At present these com missions, where appointments are made, are issued by the State Depart ment. The law, in all the depart ments of the government, except those in the post-office aud of justice, authorizes each to issue its own commissions. 

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. Always favoring practical reforms, I respectfully call your attention to an abuse of long standing, which I would like to see remedied by this Congress. It is a reform of the civil service of the country. I woulJ have it go be yond the mere fixing of the teuure of office of clerks and employes who do not require the advice and consent of the Seuate to make their appoint ments, complete. I would have it govern not only the tenure, but the manner of making all appointments. l"iere is no duty which so much em barrasses the executive and heads of departments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men, aud often not even fit men forapublic place. The elevation and the purifi cation of the civil service of the gov--rnment will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the United States. 

INDIAN AFFAIRS. Reform in the management of In diau a:lairs has received the special attention of the administration from its inauguratiou to the present day. The experiment of making it a mis sionary work was tried with a few agencies given to thedenomination of Friends, and has been found to work most advantageously. All agencies and sunerintendencies not so disposed of, were given to officers of the army. J Lue actor Congress reducing tne army reuders army offieers ineligible for civil positions. Indian agencies be ing civil offices, I determined to give all the agencies to such religious de nominations as had heretofore estab lished missionaries among the In dians, and perhaps to some other de nominations who would undertake the work on the same terms, i. e. as a missionary work. The societies selected are allowed to name their own ageuts, subject to the approvol of the Executive, andare them as missionaries aud christianize or civilize the Indian and to train him in the arts of peace. The government watches over the official acts of their agents and requires of them as strict an accountability as if they were ap pointed in any other manner. I en tertain the confident hope that the policy now pursued will, in a few years, bring ail the Indians upon res ervations, where they will live in houses, have school-houses and churches, and will be pursuing peace ful and sell-sustaining avocatious,and where they may be visited by the law-abiding white man with the same impunity that be now visits the civil ized white settlements. I call your special attention to the report of the Commissioners of Indian Affairs for full iuformation on this subject. THE 

LAND OFFICE. During the last fiscal year 8,065, 423,000 acres of public land were dis posed of. Of this quantity 896,891,005 acres were taken under the home stead law, and 215,951,581 acres sold for cash. The remainder was loca ted with military warrant, college or Indian scrip, or applied in satisfaction of grants to railroads or for other pub lic uses. The entries under the homestead law during the last year covered 951,54-3 acres more than those during the precediug year. Surveys have been vigorously prosecuted to the full extent of the means applica ble to the purpose. The quantity of laud in the market will amply supply the present demand. The claims of tiie settlers under the homestead - or the pre-emption laws are not, how ever, limited to lands subject to sale at private entry. Any unappropria ted surveyed public la'nd may to a limited amount, be acquired under the former laws, if the party r -'tied to enter under them will con:p .vith the requirements they prescribe in re gard to residence and cultivation by the actual sttlers. Preference of right of.purchase is even broader, and ex tends to lands which were unsurvey ed at the time of his settlement. His right was formerly confined within much narrower limits, and at one time in o;ir history was conferred on ly by special statutes. They were en acted from time to time to legalize what was then regarded as an un authorized intrusion upon the nation al domain. The opinion that the public lands should be regarded chief ly ai a source of revenue is no longer maintained. The rapid settlement and successful cultivation of them is now justly considered of more import ance to our well being than is the fund which the sale of them would produce. The remarkable growth and prosperity of our new states and territories attest the wisdom of the legislation which invites the tiller of the 9oil to secure a permanent home on terms within the reach of all. The pioneer who incurs the dangers aud privations of Irontier life, and thus aids in laying the foundation of a new commonwealth, renders a signal ser vice to bis country, and is entitled to its special favor aud protectior. The laws secure that object and larg ly promote the general welfare. They should therefore be cherished as a permanent feature of our land system. Good faith requires us give full effect to existing grants. The time-honored and beneficent policy of setting apart certain sections of public land for educational purposes iu the new States, should be continued. When ample provisions shall have been made for these subjects, I submit as a question whether the residue of our national domain should not be whol ly disposed of under the provisions of the homestead and pre-emption laws? 

LAND GRANTS. In addition to the swampy and over flowed lands granted to the States in which they are situated, the lands taken under the Agricultural College act? and for internal improvements or impovement purposes under the act of September, 1841, and the acts supplemental thereto, there had been conveyed up to the close of the last fiscal year by patent, or other equiva lent evidence of title, to States and corporations, 278,525,714 acres for rail ways, canals and wagon roads. It is estimated that an additional quanti ty of 174,735,523 acres is still due un der grants for like uses. The policy of thus aiding the States in building works of internal Improvement was inaugurated more than forty years since iu the grants to Indiana and Ill inois to aid those States in opening e tna's t c mntct the waters of the Wabash with those of Lake Erie, and the waters of the Illinois with those of Lake Michigan. It was followed with some modifications in the grant to Ill inois of alternate sections of public land within certain limits of the Ill inois Central Railway. Fourteen States and sundry corporations have received similar subsidies in connec tion with railways completed or in process of construction. As the re served sections are rated at the double minimum, the sale of them at the en hanced prices has thus in many in stances indemnified the treasury for the granted lands. The construction of some of these thoroughfares has un doubtedly given a vigorous impetus to the development of our resources and the settlement of the more dis tant portions of the country. It, may, however, be well Insisted that much of our legislation in this regard has been characterized by indiscriminate and profuse liberality. The United States should not loan their credit in aid of any enterprise undertaken by States or corporations, nor govern ment lands in any instance, unless the projected work is of an acknowledged national importance. I am strongly inclined to the opinion that it is inex pedient and unnecessary to bestow subsidies of either description, but should Congress determine otherwise, I earnestly recommend that the rights of settlers and of the public be effect ually secured and protected by appro priate legislation. PATENT OFFICE. During the year ending September 30, 1870, there were filed in the Patent Office 19,411 applications for patents, 3,374 caveats, and 160 applications for the extension of patents; 13,622 patents, including reissues and de signs, were issued, 110 extended, and 1,080 allowed but not issued by reason of the non-payment of the final fees. The receipts of the office during the fiscal year were $13,630,429 in excess of its expenditures. CENSUS BUREAU. . The work of the Census Bureau has been energetically prosecuted. The preliminary report, containing much informatien of special value and in terest, will be ready for delivery dur ing the present session. The remain ing volumes will be completed with all the despatch consistent with per fect accuracy in arranging and classi fying the returns. We shall thus, at uo distant day, be -furnished with an authentic record of our condition and resources. It will, I doubt not, attest the growing prosperity of thecouutry, although during the decade whic has just closed, it was so severely tried by the great war waged to maintain its integrity and to secure and perpetuate our tree institutions.
