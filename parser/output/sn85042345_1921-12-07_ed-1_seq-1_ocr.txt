Tho ordinanco was passed quickly and unanimously. in subatanco It provides for tho lssuanco of 6,800 municipal bonds n denominations of ll.uoo ea.cn. dated February 1. 1322. The bonds are payable at the rate of 272,000 each year, but the first five years" bonds aro to be paid at tno end ot the first five-year period, or on February 1, 1927.

Thereafter the bonds are to be retired at the rate of 1272,000 an nually, beginning on February 1, 19 2 S. and continuing for 20 years. or until the 2&-year period over which the bonds run has elapsed. At the end of that tlmo Tulsa will find Itself with tho Spavlnaw water project paid tor. For the first io years, or until February 1, 1922, the rate of Inter est Is fixed at 6V4 per Cent.

That Is the question which .will be answered here within the next few weeks. Great, generous-hcarted Tulsa has heard and heeded, tho pleading of voices across tho seas In the past. Her citizens have sent monay to.feed rtarvlng Chinese, starving Armenians, starving Russians. They have assisted by proxy in rebuilding sections of Franco ana Pelglum. They have been partly Instrumental In bringing the roses back to the cheeks of war orphans abroad. They havo given of their substance to Irish relief, to Jewish relief, to near east relief. Few national roller organlzatfcns havo missed this city, and few have gone away empty handed. . , . Now Tulsa has her own problem of tho hungry. Porno people don t know that there Is such a problem, but local charitable organizations know It. Humane Agent A. M. Welch gives groceries every day to somo family which would otherwlso go without. T. C. Hopkins, Amer ican legion service officer, has drawn from many a "buddio" during the past few months admission of llttlo, or nothing, cutcn that day. Employment offlcer are haunted by men anxious for any kind of a Job that will reed them and their families. To those who have a real yuletldo Inclination to help the poor but don't know how to go about It, the Empty Stocking Fund of Tho World Is almost as much of a boon as to the unfortunates whoso only prospect of an honest-to-goodness Christmas dinner Is In this fund. The Tulsa Humane society knows "who's who" among the other half In this city. They know the husband and father who Is nuking an honest effort to got work, and they aro ncqualnted too, with tho "blind beggar" with excellent eyesight and the bold mendicant with a living falsehood. They will see that the Kmpty Stocking Fund Is expended In behalf of the worthy and deserving poor.
