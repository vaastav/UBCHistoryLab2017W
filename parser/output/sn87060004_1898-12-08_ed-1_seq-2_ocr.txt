Address us tor particulars. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 8. 1898. The Guthrie Courier should be jubilantly happy. The very origi nal of its editorial top-o'column passed through that town t'other day. The Dingley law has proved ef fective in turning the home mar ket over to home manufacturers, and it will enable them to keep it. Textile Manufacturers'1 Journal. Mr. Dingley says there will be no Tariff revision legislation at the coming session of Congress. And why should there be? Everything is working well. Mankato (Minn) Free Press. The article on "ginseng" to be found on the last page of this issue is a most interesting story told in a pleasant way by Mr. H. Garman of the Kentucky State Agricultural Experiment Station. The cigarette has for centuries been distanced in Great Britian. "Sundew," "glissop" and "penny leaf" are murderous homemade mixtures of herbs smoked by poor er classes in some counties. All are said to discount our own "cof fin nails." Nature made the country a great grain producer, and the wisdom, courage and foresight of the old time Protectionists made us an in dependent manufacturing nation, soon to be felt in all the markets of the world. Cincinnati Commer cial Tribune. The county tobacco crop is moving nicely, good prices are be ing received and every farmer who owns a crop looks forward hope fully to the realization of a snugly lined purse as the reward of his labors. May their best wishes be achieved and theirs be a most joy ful Christmas and hopeful New Year. It would be interesting to hear a Free-Trade organ explain what has become of the freight of dis asters which were billed to fall on our export trade under the Dingley Tariff. All the organs of the policy under which England is steadily losing her manufacturing suprem acy to us are as silent about the Protection as if their mouths were closed by good, thick American tin plate. Washington Post. The Kentucky Court of Appeals has not rendered a decision in the Bill Goebel bill case. The Courier Journal predicted a favorable de cision several days ago and still says the bill will be sustained by a decision before the Court ad journs on December 17th. The people of Kentucky, if not a ma jority then at least an intelligent minority, are hoping that some thing may provent the fullfilment of that dire prophecy. The gentlemen on the opposition benches who are criticising the operations of the Dingley law, be cause, as they claim, it does not produce enough revenue, should IA $7.00 1 BOOK OF I EUGENE !

The Republican party has never failed to meet emergencies along the revenue line, and the gentle men on the opposition bunches an; likely to be complaining next year because we have a surplus that they are not allowed to dis burse. Chicago Infer-Ocean. The reception and celebration that has been arranged by the Louisville people in honor oi the return of the First Kentucky regi ment from Porto Rico has been postponed to December 12th, 13th and 14th. Owing to the late ar rival of the transport "Berlin" at Ponce, the regiment is not ex pected to reach New York until Saturday, December 10th. A more extended notice will be found elsewhere in these columns. Mary out of town Kcnttickians will be present and take part in the wel come. School Election. At the session of Judge Hall's County Court on Monday the the judge entered an order for an election to be held on January 17, 1899, to take the sense of the voters of school district number 4 upon the proposition to establish a graded school for that district. The district in question comprises the city of Madisonville. It is the same question that has. been before the people of that town for a long time but now it comes, it is thought, free of any legal technical objections and in form for final decision by the peo ple. It remains to be seen whether they realize the great opportunity offered for the advancement of their every interest, and will make good use of that opportunity, or whether they will be governed by a sordid and mercenary spirit which is death to every public good and material advancement. The Wage Earner. From the Tiffin (Ohio) Tribune. We have a population of 70,000,- oooof which 20,000,000 are wage earners. If they should receive a compensation of one dollar per day, the money thus earned would add to the daily circulation of our coun try $20,000,000. If by reason of prosperous times their wages are increased to two dollars per day, then we would have $40,000,000 in circulation daily. And a like ratio of increase in wages will in crease the amount of money placed daily in circulation. The margin of each day's business is the possi bility of a margin. Wendell Phil lips once said: "It is the dollar left on Saturday evening, after all the bills are paid that means education, independence, sell-respect, man hood. It increases the value of every acre near by, fills the town with dwellings, opens public libra ries and crowds them, dots the continent with cities and cobwebs country with railways. The one remaining dollar insures progress and guarantees millions to its owners." We have gained in wages dur ing the past year at least 12 per cent, in all the avenues of busi ness. The average wage paid to all classes of labor is not far from $40 per month. If we have 20, 000,000 of wage earners, then we have an annual wage of $800,000,- 000. The increase or gain for the past year being 12 per cent., amounts to nearly $100,000,000 that the wage earners of the United States have had bestowed upon them by the wise legislation of the Republican party since it came into power in 1897. The President's Message. From tbe Globe-Democrat. No message of recent years has been received with as deep and general interest as will be excited by that sent to Congress yesterday by President McKinley. It is a comprehensive document, calmly and clearly setting forth in their sequence the facts relating to the course of national affairs during this eventful year. The people are well acquainted with the Presi dent's dispassionate style and his careful, fair-minded presentation of matters of public moment. In this message his treatment of points not yet fully developed is prudent yet sufficiently indicates the firm position that he occupies. The message is thoroughly Ameri can and yet entirely respectful and considerate in its references to in ternational questions. A complete review of the history the United States has rapidly made within the last few months is presented. In the main the (message deals with the foreign war that came after an interval of fifty years of freedom from outside conflicts; but the peaceful advancement of the coun try, and its exceptional prosperity, arc given a full share of space. The mam themes are victory and good times. They are presented in no vainglorious spirit, nor is there a word that can give just of fence to any other race or govern ment. Remarks on what has come to be known as expansion will be searched for in the message with eager scrutiny. But President McKinley-ts too experienced a pub lic servant, too much of a states man and too cautious a man to as sert his individuality too far in a problem of such serious conse quence, with the treaty of peace as yet unsigned. He puts forward no distinct policy of his own. II is duty, as he sees it, is to maintain efficient military governments in the colonics Spain has lost until Congress legislates upon the next steps to be taken. The President does not undeitake to instruct Congress upon the proper course to be pursued. The message re lates to the recent past and exist ing conditions, and does not at tempt to anticipate future plans. Yet the foundation has been se curely laid and the President ap proves what has been done. In all that he says there is no word or thought that can be construed as hesitant or reactionary. The policy has steadily been onward, and if any advantage of the war is to be surrendered Congress must take the responsibility. Nothing material has been conceded up to this time. The President shows a justifiable warmth in speaking of the patriot ism of the people, of their united response to the calls of the govern ment and of the achievements of the army and navy. Strong terms, but not a grain too strong, are used in describing the extraordinary sue cession ot victories, liiey were remarkable in the extreme and the President so characterizes them. The army operations at Santiago he calls "a brilliant achievement." He speaks of "the new possessions which will come to us as a result of the war with Spain." but says their discussion would not be ap propriate until the treaty is ratified. The annexation of Hawaii is de clared to have been natural and in evitable. There is an important passage in regard to our commercial interests in China, to "our con stantly expanding direct trade with the farther Orient," which will at tract much attention, as will also the emphasized mention of friendly relations with England. The strik ing points of the message are many. It covers a broad field of topics, is its own summary and deserves a close reading in every part. W. H. 

SCOLLEY KILLED. Brakeman on Conductor Bald win's Crew Run Over at nadisonville. W. If. Scolley, braking for Con ductor Baldwin, on freight train No. 63, from Howell, Ind., to Earhngton, was run over and killed by his train at Madisonville yester day afternoon. Scolley was about twenty-seven years old and had been married four or five years. His home was in Nashville, Tenn. He was married at Bakers, Tenn., and his wife's relatives live there. Scolley was down the branch road with the train doing switch ing at the mines and fell between the cars. He was badly mangled and death was instantaneous. WAIVED TRIED. Quarterman Held to February Term of Circuit Court. A. T. Quarterman was brought to Madisonville from Henderson yesterday for trial on charge of killing brakeman Will Carr. Messrs. 'Laffoon and Orr were his attorneys. He waived exam ining trial and was held over to await the action of the February term of Hopkins" Circuit Court. Because of lack of jail facilities at Madisonville he was taken to Hop kinsville for safe keeping. Sheriff Hankins atcompanied him. Mike Long won't tell just how many birds he has killed this year, but he says his fine dog gets them all. He is a retriever from away back.

Shown In His Daily Life to a Distinguished (lather ing In Wnsnlngton. A recent Washington dispatch says: At Carroll Institute tonight, before an audience representative of social, political and ecclcsiasti cal life, a private exhibition was given of the moving pictures of Pope Leo XIII., as reproduced by the biograph. Among the dis tinguished personages present were Archbishop Martinelli, the Apolo lie Delegate to the United States; Archbishop Chapclle, Apostolic Delegate to Cuba; Monsigneur Conaty, of the Catholic University; Bishops Donahue and Curtis, 'and prominent churchmen from New York, Boston, Philadelphia and other places. The diplomatic corps was well represented and there were present members of the United States Senate, House of Representatives and many promi nent citizens. The pictures of Leo 

XIII. were enthusiastically received as Father Malonc, the well-known Catholic lectures, told their story. They represent the Pope walking in the Vatican gardens, driving in the Vatican carriage of State, and in various positions in his apartments in the Vatican. The closing scene represents him giving his blessing to his subjects in America, and was received most impressively by the audience. As Father Malonc uttered the following the audience was visibly affected: "A strong tie of personal affection unites his American chil dren to Pope Leo; and as they look upon the frail figure and the face that already seems to be reflecting back the glory of the other life, many a heart will be touched with a sense of pain and sadness. But on the other hand none can escape a thrill of pride and admiraHo'Ait the picture of sustained power that is here represented." Second District Vote.

He came home on tho afternoon train, able to walk and carry his tools but feeling quite badly. 

CARS BURNED. Tramps Driven from Freight Cars Apply the Torch. Louisville, Ky Dec. 5. A par ty of tramps, who had been driven from some box cars at Thirtieth and Alford avenues yesterday morn ing by the yardmaster at that point, got even by setting fire to the cars, three of which were burned. The tramps escaped from the police on a handcar. A can of kerosene, emptied on a pile of paper in one of the cars, and fired by a spark from one of the tramps' pipes, did the work of destruction quickly and thoroughly. Mistakes. The bank makes a mistake, and no one learns of it except the offi cers, clerks and the fellow on the outside who got the money, aid neither will tell it," says the Se dalia (Mo) Bazoo. The merchant makes a mistake, and he never tells it unless on the witness stand in a court of justice. . The lawyer makes a mistake, and he wiggles and twists or pre varicates until he clears it up, on the outside at least. The doctor makes a mistake, and the undertaker and sexton hide it from the world by piling dirt upon it. The politician makes a mistake, and he gets out of it by assuming the personality of Annanias, and it is laid at the door of the other fellow. The butcher makes a mistake by putting all pork in the sausage, and the housewife and epicurean applaud him. The newspaper man makes a mistake he puts it on a sheet of paper for the world to look at, and it cannot be erased, denied or ex plained; and in Sedalia there are some who are marvels 01 great wisdom who have, in days past, discovered where the newspapers made mistakes. Nortonville Notes. Mr. Julius Tefft, tbe long lost boy that bas been visiting in Texas, Mississippi and Arkansas returned borne last Friday as fat as a pig Mr. T. E Lull was in our city last week. Everything from Ibe telegraph wire to a mother hubbard was down Monday on account of tbe big snow. We all feel sorry for the poor sparrows and jay birds around this city as Mr. Jim Bell has got him a new shot gun. Mr. jack Gunn bas a little boy. who is very sick with the croup. Mr. W G Moorman, ot Litchfield, Ky., who bas been acting as agent at tbis place is going to resign bis office. About three weeks more and tbe cily ot Nortonville will have a new depot. Miss Ethel McCullocb, of tbis cily bas been suffering very much tbis week with toothache. Lost from Nortonville, December 4th. Ten thousand dollars will be paid for the return of a lost, lean boy about the size of an elephant. When last seen be was barefooted in bis father's boots, riding a one-wbeel bicycle crossways, at tbe rate of about thirty miles a minute. His hair was long enough to reach from Madisonville to Nortonville, a distance of eleven miles. He had on bis back a bag containing two bush els of bungboles, and a railroad tunnel. Any one giving information leading to tbe capture of this boy will be sent up for life and maybe longer. Clinker. LOCOMOTIVE BLASTS. The Railway Journal says that Pull man conductors who run in and out of Mexico do a "side line" business in tbe way of money brakerage for tbe benefit of themselves and the accommodation of tbe passenger. It works both ways. Tbe Pullman man changes United States money into Mexican as tbe traveler goes soutb and Mexican into United States on bis return. And he always charges double rates of exchange, which the wealthy trav eler usually pays without a kick. Tbe Cily of Paducab, by a resolution of tho City Council, failed and refused to pay tbe interest due on $100,000 of tbe Chicago. St. Louis, and Paducab Railroad bonds.

S A CLEAR HUAn; good digestion; sound sleep a fine appetite and a ripe old age, are some of the results of the use of Tutt's Liver Pills. A single dose will convince you of their wonderful effects and virtue. A Known Fact. An absolute cure for sick head ache, dyspepsia, malaria, sour stomach, dizziness, constipation bilious fever, piles, torpid liver and all kindred diseases. Tutt's Liver Rills power, enabling him to arrest and band over to the proper authorities, all persons found riding, or attempting to ride, on trains without permission. Such power vested in trainmen and executed would put a stop to much of tbe trouble now caused by the traveler who seekcth not work. Special Agent Harlan is fast proving himself to be an efficient officer, who, be yond doubt, favors Justice to all, and one who takes no pleasure in the prosecution of any one in order to build up a reputation Assistant Superintendent Mann came down last Monday and spent tbe night here with friends. Urakeman Carr, who was murdered last Monday night, was one of the most quiet and peaceable men on tbe road, and leaves behind a host of friends. All crews on the Henderson division are now getting all the work they desire, and you bear none of tbe boys complain ot lost time. The first passenger train run by tbe I.

Supervisor Davis, ot south end of Hen derson division is in luck, having cap tured Ibe money prize awarded by the Inspection Committee.

Operator Fawcelt is now taking a rest on account of sickness. We are pleased to know that our true and tried friend C. J. Martin is again back with tbe L. & N. as operator at East Nashville, Tenn. Mr. E. C. Oourland, who has been a resident of Earlington for some weeks wait ing to secure employment on the road, went to work on the north local several days ago. Mr Bourland will make a good and faithful employe tot tbe company Labor is reported very scarce in Mexico and the railroad companies that are build ing new lines find it a serious question. Tbe new depot at Nortonville Is fast uearing completion and is indeed a model building ot tbe kind and one badly needed at that point. Dr. W. P Ross, of Madisonville, came out Tuesday morning to consult with Dr. E. A Cbatten in the case of Brakeman Carr. Both are surgeons for tbe L 4 N. Tbe officials ot that road did everything that possibly could be done, but tbe man was beyond aid. Now there remains but lo prosecute and punish the guilty party, and strenuous efforts will be put forth by tbe friends of the dead man and by the officials of tbe railroad to avenge tbe death by legal process. 

DOWN IN THE MINES. It is now urged by some unscrupulojs labor agitator that miners be allowed to take charge of tbe scales and weigh Ibeir own coal regardless of Ibe wishes ol Ibe operator. A check weighman Ibat they so long clamored for fails lo satisfy them. We are informed that neer before in the history of the St. Bernard Coal Com pany have tbey been so crowded with orders at tbis season of the year as to necessitate tbe working of fivo quarters eacb day as was tbe case last week and to the praise of Ihe mioers it can be said they proved themselves equal to Ibe occasion. Weigher James Fegan feels proud of tbe No. q record made last week which aver aged about 16,000 bushels per day. Tbe No. it men showed up in fine shape last week and made a fine record. When called upon for extra labor tbey can be de pended upon. Mr. Tbos. Blair bas been permanently located as weigher at No. ii mines and a better selection could not well be made. Kansas is suffering a dearth of coal. Railroads confiscate much that is shipped and are so busy carrying grain Ibat coal deliveries are slow. Tbe forthcoming report of tbe West Virginia mine inspector for Ibe year end ing June 30, i8gS, will show that tbe total production ot coal for Ibe year amounted to more than 14,000,000 tons, an increase of nearly 3,000,000 tons over tbe year be fore. In Payette alone tbe increase was more than 1,000,000 tons over the preced ing year, and tbe output was increased in every county In tbe state except Mineral, Mason and Putnam. In Marion Ibo in crease was about 300 tons. The general increase was due largely to tbe steady trade during tbe summer. Bradstrcels. Tbere were more than 13,000,000 Ions of coke produced in Ihe United States in 1497, Of this amount Kentucky made 32, 117 tons, most all of which was made in Earlington. Tbe average decline in price of all tbe coke as compared with tbe prod uct of 1896 was seventeen cents a Ion. Only a small percentage of tbe 230, 267 workmen who struck for higher wages in 1897 in Great Britian carried their point only about 20 per cent. A writer for tbe U. M. W. Journal wbo lives at Island, Ky., uses this strong lan guage in regard to what be terms "scab" labor; "I have just received a letter from Bro. McCarly at Spotlsville, Ky. He tells me that they are stilt on a strike at Spotls ville, and says the company is working the mine with blacklegi, both negroes and whites. Fellow craftsmen, I oftime's try to figure out in my own mind which is Ibe worst kind of a scab tbe black or white, but ot tbe two I think tbe white is tbe meanest, low-down wretch of man on Ibe face of the earth, I say, friends, that a scab is (qua! to a murderer. Tbe differ ence is that one kills outright and the other starves innocent omon and children. Such things as scabs should reap their re wards and be punished with such traitors as Judas Iscarot, and Luken. of Illinois " Now, let us stop and reason upon ibis subject briefly A class ot men under the title of some labor organization area! work for a certain coal company and on ac count of some petty or fancied grievance, tbey order a strike, thus throwing the whole force out ol employment, thereby causing them and ibeir families untold suf' fenng After a sf ason of enforced Idle ness and urgent appeals from Ibe opera tors to again resume work, and a ref-isal to do so, tbe manager ol tbe mine feels that an effort must be made to start up work, so alone comes nnothrr class of labor, who may have formerly been victimized bv beinc members of a labor organization and through a sad experience been caiieu upon to denounce the order and show their independent manhood by seeking work whore it could be found, so lhat poverty might bo driven away from the home, asks for and is given work at tho rate of wages offered Ihe striking miner, and which tbey refused to work for Now, who Is tbe most guilty of what we may trutbiuliy term criminal idleness: the man who won t work at living wages, or tho man who pre fers even halt a loaf rather than none for tbe sake ot bis family? It is said tbe air Is filled with rumors of another strike about Massilon, Ohio. Tbe miners of four counties will bold a meet ing on December 13. Supt Salmon, of the Crablree mines, along with bis family, caroe over last week to attend the funeral ot a relative. Governor Tanner, of Illinois, bas been indicted for failiog lo send troops to pre serve order at Virden, Illinois, during tbe late coal miners' strike there. Among those on the sick list last week was J. . McGregor, but be is now able to again resume work in the mines. Foreman J W Day of tho No. 9 mine on account ot Ibo serious sickness ot bis brother, has been prevented from giving bis labor as close attention as usual. Owing to tbe rush of business, a scarcity of coal cars was felt last week. Messrs Willett and Houlahan. who op erate a small mine near Heel a, are kept quite busy filling orders. Tbe orders for nut coal exceed tbe supply they report. For every 299,000 tons of coal produced in Illinois In 1897 one coal miner was killed, while for 1898, there came up a dead coal miner with every 347,991 Ions.
