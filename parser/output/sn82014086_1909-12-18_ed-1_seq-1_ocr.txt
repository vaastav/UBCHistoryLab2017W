FORMER AMBASSADOR BIGELOW ' CRITICISES PRESIDENT TAFT On a Statement in His Message Con- corning a, Protective Tariff. New York, Dec. 17. "President Taft In his recent message to congress de nies that the recent and constantly in craesing cost of living is due to a pro tective tariff, a statement which proves nothing so clearly as that his training as a lawyer has not made of him a .statesman, -still less a political econ omist." John Blgelow, former ambassador to France, statesman, diplomatist and au thor, thus criticises the president in a letter written . to the Civic Forum, whose annual banquet will he held In New York tomorrow, i Mentally alert, although in his 92d year, Mr. Bigelow gave his views by letter because he was -unable to attend the banquet. The Civic Forum, which counts President Taft. W. J. Bryan, Bishop D. H- Greer, Justice Brewer, Archbishop Ireland, William . Dean Howells and other distinguished men among its officers, . encourages the freest utterances of opinion from its platform, though it does not make it- sen responBioie lor the views ex pressed. "Of course, under these auspices." continues Mr. Bigelow, "I see more prospect,of a revolution than of any reform in our government. For the last two years there has been a lareer army of wage earners on strike, that is, in revolt against their emnlovers. than waa at any time engaged in our Civil war by the confederate states, thus far leas bloody only because of enforced concessions to the demands of the wage earners. "How will he (Taft) explain the re cent extraordinary impulse given to the white slave traffic, except by the tariff, which compels women to aban don their proper home life and take refuge in factories of protected Indus tries for their daily bread, or else If not in consequence abandon themselves to a Ue of shame."

The contention of the immigration committee that It and not the inter state commission, has jurisdiction of tne matter, was brought up at today's meeting of the commerce commission, but it was contended that the bill In no way divests the immigration com mittee of its prerogatives. In his report, Mr. Howell, chairman of the Immigration committee, says that the changes in the law are based almost entirely upon the United States immigration commission's in vestigation.
