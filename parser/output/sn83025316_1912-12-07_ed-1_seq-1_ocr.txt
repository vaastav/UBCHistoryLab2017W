The president made no recom mendations for tariff revision, stating he would leave that sub ject to the incoming congress. Washington, Dec. 6.-President Taft will make no further effort to have congress, reduce the tariff. In a "general" message to congress sub mitted today, the president clearly in dicated his intention of leaving fur ther tariff revision to Mr. Wilson and the congress just elected. "Now that a new congress has been" elected on a platform of tariff for revenue only rather than a protective tariff and is to revise the tariff on that basis," said the president; "it is needless for me to occupy the time of congress with arguments or recom mendptlons in favor of a protective tariff." Thia message, the second submitted by the president since the present ses sion began, will be his last of a gen eral .character. It dealt with every dephrtment of the govermncment except the state department, recommended much of the legislation which 1Mr. Taft previously had urged upon the attention of congress, and took up and discussed at length several sub jects comparatively new. The Philippines. Mr. Taft came out strongly against independence for the Philippines, pro posed, he said, in a bill now before congress. Hle deprecated the new policy of on0 battleship a year ,in stead of two; anid indorsed again the scheme of currency reform proposed by the national monetary commission. Conservation was lightly touched, the president recommending the amend. ment of bills now before congress so that water power companies which dam navigable rivers will contribute to the improvement of these streams.

Following a number of fiery speeches,, the megting broke up into two factions with a committe ap pointed to confer further with the nmine owners.
