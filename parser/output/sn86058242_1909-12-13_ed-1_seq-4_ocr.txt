And while the question of the need of homes and home builders Is being discussed the fact might be pointed out that the city ordinances -which puts a tax on progrssiveness by compelling the man -who is about to build a house to pay from one dollar to five or ten for a permit is economically wrong. A great many local men, who think along these lines, are of the opinion that no improvements should be taxed. They say that the land alone should be taxed and that a premium should be put on a man'B progressiveness by exempting his improvements from taxation. But there is no question that it discourages the building of homes to make it necessary for a man to pay a fee for a building permit the instant he begins work on the very Improvement that the business men are crying for. It would have been better If building to the man whose home costs less than made for permits in the case of buildings which cost more than $1,500. But a better plan than that would Inspector out of the city treasury and cost of building inspection. Under llshed as the owners of property would burdens a much needed lift. The Duluth-News-Tribune has the "Some time cities will develop along the lines of sanity to the point where they will consider it a good thing for the residents to build homes and business houses. When that time comes they will encourage such invest ments, and not begin taxing-them, with "Then, when the buildings are erected, they will not make the owner pay r.nt to the city for living in them. As it Is now, even in Duluth, it is at least as cheap to rent as to own a home. The man who pays, say $35 a month as rent, can save little or nothing in cash by building, and the reason for this Is not the high rate of interest if borrowed, but largely because of the "This process begins with a building permit, which is, while first, almost the crowning absurdity of them all. When a man decides to build, he must take bis plans to the building inspector, who estimates the cost when com pleted. Upon this is based a fee of $1.50, if it is the humble home of the poor man who is trying to house himself and family in two or three clean and decent rooms, to cost not over $500." . "If the cost is over that sum, $1 is added for each additional $500 or fraction thereof, so that the modest home of the worklngman, in which he will invest $1,200 to $1,500, must pay the tribute of $3.50. The same increase is made up to $10,000, and the man of moderate means, who wants a $4,000 or $5,000 home, must pay $8.50 or $9.50 for the privilege of building it." "When the class of the rich is reached, that is, above the $10,000 mark, the fee is cut to one-fourth and is 50 cents for each additional $1,000. This is but the usual discrimination against justice, which would make the fee start at the $10,000 house and produce revenue enough to leave the poor man free of this tax." "But could anything more repugnant to just ordinary common horse sense be conceived than this initial tax on building, provided cities want buildings and want their people to own their own homes? Under present conditions each structure adds just so much to the assessment rolls and the tax revenues. Why, then, discourage the increase of taxable property by this fee?" 

BECKER ON HAMMOND'S ALLEYS. The TIMES has critized Mayor Becker severely for many of his offi cial act3 but these criticisms have been made in the hope that by fearlessly pointing out what this paper believes have ben the mistakes of the administration-some of them may be avoided in the future. But the TIMES is fair enough to also point out any good moves that Mayor Becker may make and any act of his that will make Hammond a big ger, better and more beautiful city, that will give it the reputation that Gary has of doing big things, will be given the stamp of this paper's approval. At the "Get Together and Bury the Hatchet" banquet, given at the Masonic temple in Hammond, Mayor .Becker pointed out the deplorable con dition of Hammond's alleys. He showed only too plainly that the business men in the mercantile dis trict of the city have discouraged any effor" on the part of the city to pave the alleys and have remonstrated against such improvements even when the need of them has been plainly apparent. Mayor Becker said in the future the city administration expected to take up the question of paving the alleys and if the property owners oppose this improvement the city will . pave them any way. It was just such determination that is responsible for the fact that Hammond has cement walks all over town instead of the old wooden walks that once were the shame of the city. The people were forced to see the error of their ways and now there is no one who is not glad that Mayor Knotts had the backbone to force the improvement. Now if Mayor Becker forced the property owners in the business dis trict of the city to pave the alleys, whether they are disposed to do so or not, posterity will thank him and the TIMES will give him its support in his plan to see the matter through. It is a shame that property owners who have made fortunes out of Hammond real estate should be so reluctant to do their share towards mak ing Hammond a metropolis. ON MAKING PEOPLE HAPPY. Don't put off your plans for making Christmastide a happy time for some one. Make them now, make them early. If you haven't children of your own to make happy, see if there isn't some other little tots that you can make happy. See if there isn't some poor family that you can single out and give them the gladdest surprise they ever had in the world. Forget society and business long enough to come into the life of some suffering soul with cheer lness and optimism. Don't make light of the season of the year that should be given over to deeds that will make your own heart glow with the know ledge that everything in this world isn't sordid, that the pursuit of the almighty dollar 13 not everything. There are those around you whose hearts ache with the desperate pursuit of pennies that will hold body and soul togther. They are the ones you should seek out and help. Now is the time to look them up and get ready to make them remember Christmas of 1909 for years to come. Don't wait until December 24. Do it now. You 'ill be amply repaid. permits were granted free of charge $1,500 and a graduated charge was be to pay the salary of the building that would prorate to a certainty the that plan hose who already are estab give the man who is taking on new followingto say on this subject: the fir3t visible sign of construction. he must pay on the money invested, taxing of industry ." RANDOM THINGS AND FLINGS NO reason dor old Jack Frost to be so rough in his play. OF course it may be proper to have the snow shoes ready. -99- ONLY a few days more to do your Christmas shoplifting. 1 2 FEAR that Mr. Taft will have to forget bogey for a few weeks. a r- SET a good example even if you know it will never hatch out. THERE are several grapplers in Hammond, but none of them like Zjbysko. IF the furnace goes out bottle up your wrath and then hurry up to lose the cork screw. DON'T forget the loved ones whom it takes quite a while for a Christmas present to reach. AMID it all, there is one grain of comfort. Nobody is asking "13 it hot enough for you?" 

THERE is something about Mr. Tawney of Minnesota that doesn't make you think of a lion. , EVERY man of course Is of some importance in the world but seldom as much as he thinks he is. IT isn't winter for you yet until the small boy has copped you behind the left ear with an extensive Bnowball. IT is not too late to do a little Christmas advertising. It is the ad vertiser who is getting the business. ONE of the things that some dense fellows in this world fail to under stand is why their enemies have so many friends. IF language was given to one non descript editor hereabouts to clothe his thoughts, the Lord knows he is an awful misfit. . 'TIS a pity that a man can't hear his widow telling her second husband what a kind and generous soul her first husband was. THIS is the time of the year when the lodge man gets all the excitement he wants fixing up the slate for the annual list of officers. THE modern buckwheat blankate is doing its best to imitate the old fash lond kind that mother made, but it is a dank and dismal failure. VISITORS to the White House find President Taft suffering from a cold. First time we ever heard that the President was a stylish man. WE should like to be within hear ing of Gov. Marshall when that "dele gation of Gary citizens" ask for per mission to hold that prizefight WALTER 

WELLMAN says that President Taft's message is only a dull foreward. Well Wally we can't all be as good at guff-writing as you. -A KANSAS CITY woman said she had six husbands and was sick of matri mony. We still doubt however, wheth er she has given matrimony a fair trial. THE information is now being ped dled around that there are scabs in religion as in labor circles. As far as that is concerned there are scabs everywhere. nijcj&ni iigntning calculators are just the ones who are most apt to get knocked over by an auto when they are crossing a street and think they can beat the auto. 

DETROIT News asks "How much should a man have when he marries?" Well he ought to have at least five times as much as he thinks it will take two to live on. MR. ROOSEVELT bagged a digdig and a kob and Kermit has killed a bongo, but up to the hour of shoving the fourth form on the steam table neither one of them has succeeded in getting next to a bloppo or a snigdop. A WOMAN can put no greater con fidence in another woman than when she confides to her that she has found a bed bug and when her confidence doesn't get all around the neighbor hood, she knows that at last she has found a true friend. . THE esteemed Chicago Trib in pointing out that more money was stolen from Indiana Postoffices during the last year than from any other state in the union, points out that Indiana always leads. Yes' that's a fact, in everything but orgy balls Indiana al ways leads. eart to If ear t Talks. By EDWIN A. NYE.. THE VILLAGE OF EOPE. Over the hill to the poorhouse I can't quite make it clear. Over the bills to the poorhouse It seems - so horrid and queer. The poorhouse, often the dreariest place in every countryside, was so called in the old days, when paupers were treated as little better than beasts and all insane people were put in irons. It was a name that spelled terror to the unfortunate. Now there is being built at Oak For est, about eighteen miles from Chi cago, a real home for the poor of Cook county. It stands on a high tract of rolling land in a fine grove of oaks and will cost when completed 52,000, 000. It is not named poorhouse. It Is called the Village of Hope. That strikes a new note in humani- tarianism. It proposes to put hope Into the hearts of the hopeless. This new home is a real village of streets, each cottage by Nitself. Old married couples are not to be sepa rated into wards, but will occupy the rooms together, where they can help and comfort one another. Life will be made worth while by broad, open porches, recreation rooms, a chapel, an artificial iake and all sur roundings of comfort. But will it pay? That is the question the taxpayer asks the county commissioners. The answer is: "Yes. It will pay. even in dollars and cents." There is a fine farm, with barns, Im plements, tools. The people will be glad to works best they can under such conditions. Those who cannot work on the farm can do housework or go Into the shops. ' The people will be kept happy by being kept busy and under conditions that will pr6mote self respect. If they work for their living they are not paupers. It 13 claimed that with pleasant homes and cheerful surroundings the workers will support not only them selves, but will in time repay the $2,000,000. That is the experience at Cleveland, O., where a similar experiment has been made. The world moves. The time is coming when the grim, prison-like, dreary quarters of the county poorhouse will give way to vil lages of hope. Society owes its aged and unfortu nate a chance to live out their lives not only In peace, but In comfort. Most of them have already done their share of the world's work.

Mayor Bookwalter of Indianapolis Saturday vetoed the ordinances pro viding salary Increases for firemen and policemen, which were passed at the las meeting of the city council against his advice. An effort will be made to pass the ordinances over the mayor's veto, but there is some doubt as to the success of such a move, as It la be- lieved the councilmen -who opposed the ordinances when they were passed, -will not change their positions.

It appears In some cases, said Dr. Aley, that the teachers have been victimized. SHOW GIRLS ARRESTED.
