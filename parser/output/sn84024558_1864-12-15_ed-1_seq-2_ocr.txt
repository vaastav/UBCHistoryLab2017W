THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. We had neither time nor space for lengthy comments upon the annual message of J'res ident LINCOLN, published in our last week's issue. It is no exaggeration to say that the country never looked with more anxiety for a message nor ever read one with pro founder satisfaction. President 

LINCOLN possesses in an eminent degree the love and confidence of the people. There is a wide-felt conviction of his honesty of pur pose, of his frankness, of his whole-souled devotion to the interests of the country, which has strengthened with every act of his Administration. At times seemingly slow, the public have chafed at his appar ant tardiness to inaugurate and press to consummation measures demanded |by the exigencies of the times ; but at the same time they have marked with satisfaction that he took no step backward, and that his progress, though slow, was sure. The late triumphant re-election of Presi dent LINCOLN was as much an expression of this popular feeling, as a verdict in favor ol those measures which he has laid down for his guidance in prosecuting the war, for de livering the country from the heavy and grevious burdens we are now suffering, and for finally restoring and reconstructing the Union—making it a more perfect Union, whose future greatness and prosperity shall more than compensate for the firey trials and bloody tribulations through which we are now passing. The President evidently appreciates this phase of the popular ver dict—and accepts it in its widest sense.— The satisfaction which it gives him is ev ident in the plain and straight-forward ut terances of the Message. The confidence of the people in him has not been misplaced. Recognizing the fact that the Rebellion is the legitimate offspring of slavery, that the country has been plunged into civil war, and deluged with blood in an attempt to strengthen and perpetuate this accursed system of human bondage, and also the popular demand that its sin and danger shall be forever removed from the country, the President goes straight to the root of the foul enormity. He recommends to the pres ent Congress that it too, shall recognize and act upon the popular evil, and at once pass the necessary legislation to provide for the Constitutional amendment which shall wipe out the remnants of slavery still existing, and not leave to the next Congress the glory and credit of the act, which will be the proudest and brightest statute ever en acted in any land. The closing paragraph of the President's Message are worthy of especial notice. The glorious record he there makes for himself is the proudest act of his career. They strike a responsive chord in the heart of the nation, and will endear him to every patriot for all time to come. The intense gratifi cation with which they have been hailed, will do much to encourage him, and strengthen his hands through the trials and labors of the new term upon which he is about to enter. A nation's heart-felt and earnest prayer goes up that he may be spared, to guide the good ship of Stab' for the next four years. 

REPORT OF THE NAVY DEPARTMENT. This document affords a fine picture of the rapid progress and glorious achievements of our navy during the past year. Of the passages relating to the events of that pe riod we have not space now to speak, were it necessary. But the exhibit of the naval force is something demanding attention.— We have now 671 vessels, carrying 4610 guns, and of an aggregate tonnage of 510,- 306. Other navies may exceed these fig ures, but in point of efficiency there is now no navy surpassing ours. We have no less than 71 iron-clad vessels of war, carrying 275 guns. But the pride of our ocean navy are undoubtedly our 113 wooden steamers, built especially for war, and carrying 1,126 guns of the ability whereof tha Kearsarge has borne testimony. Secretary Wells again repeats his urgent recommendation to Con gress to accept League Island from the city of Philadelphia, and establish thereon a great naval depot for iron-clad vessels. We trust that Congress will adopt the sugges tion, and thus relieve the department of much of the embarrassment under which it now labors. The arguments he advances in support of his suggestion are very impor tant. As had been anticipated, Mr. Wells recommends the establishment of the grade of vice-admiral in the navy, and that the rank be conferred on Rear Admiral D. 0. Farragut, for his brilliant services in the Mississippi river and in Mobile bay, in which we think the loyal masses every where will most heartily concur. The num ber of naval prizes captured since the com mencement of the war is given at 1379, of which 267 were steamers, and the gross proceeds of sales thereof $14,396,250, the liett proceeds above expenses being $13,. 190,841, of which one-half goes to the United States gpyernijj£ttt as a naval pen sion fund. The expenditures of the Naval Department during the fiscal year were I $85,733,292, and the whole estimated ex penditure of the Department to the 4th of March next $280,<147,261 from the coin mcncment of the present Administration. HON. 

JOHN VV. FORNEY. We copy from Fitzgerald's (Phila.) City Item an editorial which we have no doubt expresses the general and earnest opinion of the Union party of Pennsylvania. Since ; it was written that opinion lias been very emphatically declared by many of the in- Huential papers of the State, and endorsed by many eminent leaders of the party. The Commercial Exchange of Philadelphia, a body composed of the leading merchants of j the city, recently passed resolutions urging Mr. Forney's pre-eminent fitness for a posi-* tion in the new Cabinet, and appointing a committee to present them to the President. The movement is, in fact, a spontaneous recognition of Mr. Forney's great ability and invaluable services to the country, and of the noble course he has taken since the rebellion begun. We need not say how heartily we concur in the suggestions of our cotemporary. Mr. Forney ought to be in the Cabinet, and not only as the represen tative leader of Pennsylvania, but as one whose patriotism is absolute, whose intel lect is commanding, and whose ability to serve the Republic in its highest places is universally acknowledged. The following are the remarks of the Item: — " Unquestionably there will be changes in the Cabinet Mr. Seward will remain Secretary of State, for no one could have better managed our relations with foreign powers, or is so well fitted by experience and ability for the responsibilities of the office. Mr. Stanton will certainly continue Secretary of War ; a change in this depart ment could not be to the national interest. Of Mr. Welles' intentions we are entirely ignorant, but if he chooses to withdraw it will be with general regret. This depart ment has received harsh criticism, but it has been conducted with energy and suc cess. Mr. Fessenden's retirement was thought probable some weeks ago, but it now appears that he will remain Secretary of the Treasury, and that Hannibal Hamlin will succeed him in the Senate. The coun try would be the loser by the resignation of Mr. Fessenden, for not only would too many changes in the Treasury Department be dangerous to the public welfare, but his special fitness for the position is universally recognized. These elements of the Cabi net, ought therefore to be and almost cer tainly will be, permanent, but there will be vacancies to be filled for the next I'residen tial term is no longer to be doubted. The Chief Justiceship, vacated by the death of Taney, will be filled from a Western State, and it is probable that the resignation of the Secretary of the Interior will follow. " His successor should be a Pennsylva nian. This great commonwealth is not rep resented in the Cabinet, for Mr. Stanton is properly from Ohio, but it should be, under a just balance of power, and this is no doubt the opinion of the Government. The suc cessor of Mr. Usher should be a represen tative man, an earnest, uncompromising pa triot, and a statesman, and if we call the roll of illustrious Pennsylvanians who have distinguished themselves by their services to the Union in this war, we shall not find one who has surpassed Hon. 

JOHN W. FOR. XEY in the energy and wisdom of true loy alty. We do not know that Mr. FORNEY would accept this office, but we know that many eminent Pennsylvanians, and they the most earnest of the friends of the Ad ministration, have expected that the Gov ernment shall recognize by his appointment the influence and loyalty of the state. Cer tainly there is no man who more thoroughly represents Pennsylvania than he. During the late canvass for Governor and Presi dent his personal influence made him one of the foremost of the loyal leaders, and ids example controlled the action of thousands of War Democrats, and patriots of all par ties. Outside of this, his national services have uuqestionably been great and promi nent. From the first to the last he has been faithful to the country. But placing all this political service aside, his ability as a true statesman is not at this day to be doubted. It would be well for the country were he in the Cabinet. Upon his experi ence and loyalty it can depend in the future, for he has never been found wanting in the past. " The nomination of Mr. FORNEV for the next vacancy in the Cabinet, will be backed by the whole fbrcc of this State. If Penn sylvania is to be fully represented in the Executive councils, his name must be con sidered among the first, and we can discover no real objection to his appointment except the possibility of his own refusal." REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. Mr. FESSENDEN, in his report, has given a thorough and intelligible report of the condition of the national finances, and its candor is not its least value. In his intro ductory remarks, the Secretary admits the difficulties that still confront the Govern ment, while his whole report furnishes evi dence that the resources of the nation, properly used, are sufficient to remove them. The Republic has now a debt of seventeen hundred and forty millions six hundred and ninety thousand four hundred and ninety nine dollars and forty cents, the annual in terest of which is, in round numbers, nine ty-one millions. The reduction of this debt is at present impossible. The daily expen diture is aboqt two and a quarter millions, while the daily receipts are not quite one million and a l alf. Thus we are running in debt at the rate of one million and three quarters daily, a fact which should cer.ain ly have serious consideration. The only way to reduce this rate is by the imposition of new taxes, by which the daily receipts, according to Mr. 

FESSENDEN'S estimate, may be raised to two millions. The system of taxation he recommends will produce an internal revenue of three hundred millions yearly. Yet, even with the additional rev enues from customs and other sources, the debt inusi grow, and it is calculated that the increase during the year ending .Tune 30, 186"), will be 1,482,372,188. These fig ures are not alarming. On the contrary, w • arc surprised that so candid an exhibition of the situation as Mr. FESSRNDEN has made should be so encouraging. But the facts show that Congress should earnestly ad dress itself to the enlargement of the na tional revenue to the full extent of the na tional resources. In the last, two years we have laid the foundation of a sound system and one of the great duties of the future is its thorough development. Mr. FESSKXDKX advises the appointment of a commission to examine the. subject of taxation, and this wise and practical suggestion should have the immediate attention of Congress. THE NEW CHIEF Jr.STICK.— During all of President Lincoln's administration, he has done nothing which has given more univer sal satisfaction to the loyal people than the appointment of Salmon P. Chase Chief Jus tice,in the place of Roger B. Taney, deceas ed. It is putting the right man in the right place, and is a guarantee that the Supreme Court is not to be used as an engine of ty ranny and oppression to find excuses for holding men in bondage. It is end to that legal brutality which could declare that the negro "has no rights which white men are bound to respect." Mr.Chase's whole political life has been consistently averse to the institution of slavery, and whenever the law allowed him to act against it he has acted. lie knows that the President had the right, as an act of war,to declare all the slaves in the rebellious States free, tie knows that such a proclamation made the law and did emancipate every slave;and lie knows that no man or set of men have any right to reduce these emancipated men to bondage again. Should the- question come up, such would be his decision, and the de cision of 11 io Supreme Court. The era of op pression which Jefferson feared with that Court has passed and the era of justice tempered with humanity has been inaugur ated. Let us rejoice!
