Berlin telegrams of the 4th inst. announce that the famine in upper Siberia had become so serious that over a third of the population were starving in many villages. Famine is also appearing in Saxony among peasants and weavers. The total vote cast for Governor in this State at the recent election was 105,633, devided up amongst the four candidates as follows: J.

The last leg islature of Georgia passed an act that $200,000 annually be taken from the treasury for some years Each ex-Confederate soldier who lost a leg is entitled t $80 annually, ind $60 each for lost arms. The Czar of Russia very narrowly escaped death by explosion on Mon day night the 1st inst. The explo sives had been placed under the rails of the track leading to Moscow, over which the Czar had to pass on that night. But there had been a miscalculation on the part of some one, as the explosion took place at the time of the passing of the bag gage train, a snort time after the Czar's passage over the route. Dr. Wilhelm, the successful man ufacturer of amber sugar and syrup, has received enough encouragement from certain capitalists in St. Paul to warrant him in establishing an extensive refinery in St. Paul and also an establishment for manufac turing the machinery required bj cultivators of cane in pieparing the crude syrup for the refinery. This is a highly important interest, and promises to be of immense value to Minnesota.P. P. A good deal has been said about large wheat farms in the northwest, but it seems that they have exten sive domains of that sort in Califor nia also. Dr. Gleen, of that State, had 45,000 acres under cultivation this year, and produced a crop of 800,000 bushels of wheat. To work his immense ranch requires 400 double teams. So far as heard from the Doctor is the King of the Gran gers.Owatonna Journal. The supreme court of Pennsylva nia has decided that in the absence of statutory provisions a county is not bound to pay the tees of attorneys appointed by the courts to defend criminals. This is simply an affir mation of the old doctrine, that as lawyers are officers of the court, one of the burdens which is incident to their official position is the gratui tous service rendered to a poor pris oner at the suggestion of the court. In old times this was considered a very honorable service, but it has somewhat degenerated. Pioneer Press. Cleopatra's needle will soon be in readiness to ship to America. An Alexandria correspondent says the obelisk has been cleared to the base, twenty feet below*the present level of the soil, and it now stands on a block of granite weighing forty tons which again rests on three wide slabs. The monument will be low ered at the begining of December, and launched in a case, which will be towed to the arsenal wharf, where the whole will be thrust lenghtwise into the hull of the steamrr. Congressman Washburn of this State who has been pumped by a Washington reporter as to the pre sidential outlook in Minnesota, says: "The Grant movement is a taking one in Minnesota. It is the one all absorbing political topic with the masses of our people, among whom Gen. Grant is exceedingly popular. I don't think, however, that the po liticians want Grant. At least, that is what I can see from outside appearances. But they are advocat ing his nomination as a matter of policy. The people everywhere are for Grant, so far as my observation goes." NEW ULM 

REVIEW, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 10,1879- Chief-Justice Gilfillan hasfiledan opinion in the Supreme Court mak mg it obligatory upon all railroads to construct fences, cattle guards, etc., for the protection of life and property also one to the effect that a person can recover damages if he is injured in jumping from a train when the train is in a dangerous si tuation through the negligence of the company, even if he might have escaped injury by remaining, in the car, providing the attempt to escape appears to be one which a person acting with ordinary prudence would make. The decision arose in the case of Alexander Wilson vs. the Northern Pacific RailroadRed Wing Argus. Andrew Tracy was a young law yer who shot and killed his cousin and sweetheart, and condemned to be hanged at Smith port, Pennsylva nia, on the fourth of December. Pe titions numerously signed were be fore the boa-d of pardons, and apoperations parently there was hope for him but in an evil hour he took to writ ing poetry, and made his defense in verse. That was a fatal mistake. The signers for his pardon reconsid ered their action, and the board quickly disposed of his case. Tracy was hanged, and it is to be hoped will serve as a wholesome example against writing poetryespecially such poetry as he wrotewhich is about as good as the averagePi oneer Press. The Danes are about the unhap piest people in Europe, and notpensive without good reason. They expect to see their country sliced up, before many years, for the benefit of Prus sia and Sweden. Denmark can no longer defend the communications between Jutland and the islands by the superiority of her fleet, as she did during former wars with Germany, and it has been decided to concen trate the whole defense of the coun try upon the island of Sealand, where the resources of the greater part of the nation are centered, instead of attempting to defend Jutland and the island of Fuhnen. The inhabi tants of Copenhagen are impressed with the conviction that Prussia in tends to occupy Denmark and acsummer quire Jutland and Fuhnen, while Sweden will take Sealand and the surrounding islands as her share of the spoil. This would be tanta mount to the final division of Den mark, begun in 1815, by uniting Norway to Sweden and followed by Prussia's occupation of the duchies of Schleswig-Holstein and Lauen burg. The ultimate possibility of news* paper premiums seems to be reached, this year, by THB NEW YOBK TRI- BUNE. When it gave away Web ster's Unabridged Quarto Pictorial Dictionary to single fire years sub scribers to its WEEKLY, we thought it had gone to the utmost limit. But it placed 15,000 of these Dictionar ies-the biggest sale ever heard of and is now starting out on some thing yet more surprising. To a single five years' subscriber, who merely adds $2 to the regular remit tance for five years to its WEEKLY (making in all only $12) it sends as a gift a full set ot Chambers's En cyclopedia, the latest edition, with American additions, in twenty vol umes, containing in all, by printers measurement, 12 per cent, more mat ter than Appletrn's Cyclopaedia, which sells tor eighty dollars! We don't know how the thing is done, but what THE TRIBUNE has accom plished heretofore in the same line shows that it does! TH E TRIBUNE is now the great national paper of the Republicans, and whoever wants a New-York paper should send for it. We print its prospectus on first page, and urge friends that, after their local paper, the very best way to make votes for the Republican candidate for the Presidency in 1880 is to push THE TRIBUNE'S circula tion now. All the campaign com mittees found this last Fall. TH E TRIBUNE is, besides, the best gener al paper for county circulation, and the best farmer's paper while its pure tone and abundant provision for the household interest and for the children always make it a fami ly favorite. A Democratic Opinien. Jackson county is one of the dark est political spots in Minnesota. Eleven towns in that county did not give Rice a vote. It is so dark up there the people all carry lanterns in mid-day. Chamberlain, editor of the Jackson County Republic, wears glasses all the year round, and then can scarcely tell one black Republi can from another. A Democrat from Illinois who moved into that county last spring brought some chickens with him, the moment they crossed the line they "took to the roost" and never lett it. It is utter ly impossible to raise chickens in Jackson Co. The only sure crop is Republicans. They never scratch a ticket nor rob hen roosts!Winona Herald. MINNESOTA NEWS. \The State grange will meet in Albert|rLea, next Tuesday, Dec. 16th. A prisoner named Sullivan set fire to the lockup in Duluth but the blaze was speedily quenched. The State Educational Associa cion will meet at St. Paul on De-ed tember9th, 30th and 31st. The Lake Crystal folks decided by a vote of 60 against 20 to erect a $6,000 schoolhouse, to be built in 1880. Pipestone City, Pipestone county, celebrated the arrival of the first lo comotive into that place, on the 27th ult. Mr. R. C. Mitchell of the Duluth Tribune, is styled the Bob Ingersoll of the Northwest by the Breckin ridge Free Press. Ice formed on Lake Pepin Nov? 28, which effectually closed naviga tion for the season of 1879. The lake opened April 14. S. H. Eenney, of Morristown, Rice county, recently forwarded 10,- 000 pounds of amber cane seed to the agricultural department, Washing ton, for which he received $1,000. In Elgin, Wabasha county, a cow belonging to a farmer lived thir teen days beneath a straw stack which had blown down upon her. She was found to be uninjured when dug out. On the 18th ult. Charles and Jes se Ackerman, of Pelican Rapids, while hunting were drowned at the edge of a small lake by falling through the ice. Charles Hess, of Cardova, LeSueur county, recently received $700 back pension. He belonged to the first regiment and is said to have been the first Minnesota soldier wounded in the late war. Seven saw mills at Stillwater have sawed 146,765,820 feet of lumber during the past season, and there are yet on hand about 22,988 095 feet of logs with which to begin next year. On the evening of November 26th, John Peterson, while skating with Benjamin Noxel on North Fenny Lake, in Isanti county, fell through the ice and was drowned. Waseca Herald: Some wandering Arabs went into a school house in St. Mary one night last week and proceeded to warm themselves by a fire which they kindled with some of the school books. Hanging would be just a little too good for such mis creants. The St. James Journal thinks that a district court is a very ex luxury, the sitting of the grand jury to indict three ot its ci tizens costing $400, and three entire days being occupied in the trial of a case in which the verdict only amounted to $20. A man with an Irish brogue re cently entered the house of H. Hal versen in Vernon, Dodge county, while the latter was taking supper. The stranger demanded Mr. Hal versen's money or his life, aided by a revolver. Money as given him and he departed. The mutilated remains of Fred Goltz were found in the brush on Tuesday, the 2d, in Green Isl. Last he attempted to kill his for mer wife, Mrs. Schauer, and then shot himself. His coat was found folded up under the skull and a re volver was found near the bones of the right hand. Messrs. Jenness, Johnson, and Hon. Edward Larsson will com mence the publication of a Norwe- gianEnglish newspaper at Will mar, Kandiyohi county, about the first of January next. The patent insides are to be English, and theand outside Norwegian. Mr. Larson will edit the paper. Is Amber Cane a Profitable Crop? Winona Republican. A farmer argues in the Faribault Republican that amber cane is not a profitable crop to raise in Minnesota. He estimates the cost of'cultivating an acre of cane, including interest on the value of the land, at $36 25. Eight tons of cane leracre is assum ed to be the average yield, which will produce about 230 gallons of syrup. The refining process causes a shrinkage which the writer esti mates at 20 per cent. As to the rest, we quote his remarks as follows: "We still have left over twenty two gallons per ton. What becomes of the other ten gallons? Did the pan leak* At the refinery in the city ot Faribault they squeezed out twelve gallons of refined syrup per ton, of which the farmer received six gal lons. At fifty cents per gallon, the wholesale price, it would be equiva lent to three dollars per ton, or $24 per acre for the cane, and 24 from $36.25 leaves $12 25 that the farmer pays for his amusement in the trans action, or it might be more properly termed the farmer's profit." This is the first discouraging state ment in relation to the cane syrup manufacture that we have seen. Is it borne out by the general experi ence thus far? "I Acknowledge the Corn." This is said to be the origin of the fn hrase, "I acknowledge the corn*." 1828, Andrew Stewart, a member of Congress said in a speech that Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana sent their hay stacks, corn fields and fod der to New York and Philadelphia for sale. Wickliffe, of Kentucky, called him to order, declaring that those States did not send haystacks or corn fields to New York for sale. "Well, what do you send?" asked Stewart. "Why, horses, mules, cattle and hogs!" "Ton feed H0 0 worth of hay to a horse. You just animate and get upon the top of your hay stack and ride off to mark et. How is it with your cattle? You make one of them carry $50 worth of hay and grass to eastern market. How much corn does it take, at 33 cents a bushel, to fatten a hog?" "Why, thirty, bushels." "Then you put that thirty bushels into the shape of a hog, and make it walk off mifc W iB. to the eastern market." "Then sir, Wickliffe jumped up and said: '"Mr: Speaker, I acknowledge the corn." Wild Cats Captured. Rochester Post. Mr. M. L. Seaman, of Haverhill, exhibited on the streets, Mondaj, a couple of wild cats which he captur on the farm of C. C. Willson, near this city. The animals were caught in traps and afterwards shot The larger one measured over three feet from tip to tip, seventeen inch es in height and weighed thirty three pounds. The smaller one weighed twenty-five pounds.
