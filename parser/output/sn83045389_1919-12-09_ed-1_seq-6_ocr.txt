' It is an old story of the man who found the tact that he was in jail actually outweighing ?iic assurance or his lawyer that he could not possibly be there legally. Cavranza reverses this with the fact that Jenkins is free really, itlthough he assured us that under Mexi lian law his freedom was Impossible and in conceivable. Not in years has a public man been so pointedly and caustically rebuked as Sena tor ISIoses has been by the President of the United States. The latter's message, tell ing. of his quickening recovery, because "it will reassure, but disappoint him," must feting the Senator to the quick unless his skin ifi.-jjuusually thick. It at least should curb him from making further offhand diagnoses and change his mind as to tho President uejjer again being "any force iu public life." ;Sweetly deferring to local demagogues and p<}mical howls, the Council of Toledo, Ohio, lotttuuliy ordered the trolley cars out of town.

America was led to believe thai in tho closing days of the world conflict its air service compared very favor ably with that uf the other powers with which it. was lighting.

IT tiiis be true, and there is no reason to dpubt it. then it is mure than disgraceful ? it is criminal. 4 ; Republican leaders in the House have litfltf a confercnce at which a drastic policy of economy in appropriations and govern mental expenditures was determined upon. The country will heartily support an honest program to reduce governmental expendi tures, but it has little hopes of the Repub licans carrying out such a program. Rather, past, experience teaches that when Repub lican leadership in Congre5s is seized with a miasm for economy it means a program of deception in which essential service is crippled by niggardly appropriations, while wasteful ones arc authorized elsewhere under artful wording which does not at the time discloso the huge amounts involved in the ultimate meeting of these appropriations. No doubt sueli economies as are instituted will be dlreeted at branches of the public service where enforced restriction upon iheir useful ness will provoke popular complaint, to the end that the Republican party may take advantage of the situation for political gain. Soldier Power In Politics " 

SURVEY of returns of recent elections iu several States shows no rush to vote for soldier candidates. Thoso who won seeiu to have done so on their merits as citizens and men or tlie faults or weaknesses of their opponents, regardless of military records. The leading candidate for President at this moment is General Wood, who was not ul lowcd to go abroad and whose strength is in his achievements as an executive official and not iu his army work or deeds. Evidelitly, the people arc not yet ready to reward with ollico servico iu the army unless it is backed by other qualifications. Unless the popular j temper changes, incompetent, unpopular a^l ,? doubtful men will he unable to cash iu on war records solely, and those politicians who I already are preparing to inakq si specialty of j tlie soldier vote and to ride into jobs, or back ' into them, on soldier backs are doomed to j disappointment. . I The soldiers themselves, generally, are I taking a thoroughly honorable, manly and j sensible position. They are not rallying up- j prcciably to those who angle for their sup- : port with impossible and unwise suggestions j and promises. They are asking only the re wards due for the faithful doing of a plain duty. Understanding that their valor and service saved the world from Hun* tyranny, they understand also that they fought and wrought as much for their own sukes as for others, and that they met a responsibility that was put upon them when they became | male citizens of the Commonwealth. .Many of the more hysterical and impor tunate politicians, of various grades and de grees of importance, forget or ignore the tacts and underestimate the intelligence of the soldier. They picture him as an un selfish and devoted hero and martyr, offer ing life and blood for the rescue of those having no claim on his generosity and for a country iu which he had no interest of his own. The truth Is, lie fought for the pro lection of his own life, liberty, home and i 'property, present or prospective, for his j lamily and his children, born or to be born i heroafter. As a citizen of the republic he owed service lo the government at its time of need as directly and certainly-as any debt (hat can he owed. It is part of the goueral and mutual bargain on which organized so- ! ciety and all civilized governments are es tablished. We expect and receive the pro lection aud help of our governments for our selves and all we have. In return wo are expected, and by universal consent agree, to I perform certain duties, to do fuir shares of\| the work of maintaining and enforcing tho laws, to pay taxes, to fight or give such other service as we can when the country is at war. While so much mushy and frothy stuff is being poured out upon us, it is well to keep ! before ourselves these rugged fundamentals. We owe the soldier what wo owe any citizen who has paid his debts and fulfilled faithfully his obligations lo the public, bis 1 family and bis community. When lie has [ been injured in our service?iu promoting 1 the general welfare?we owe him all wo can ! do to make him as capable aud to give him as good a chance in life as he had. We owe him respect and affection because he Vas called on for unusually trying and dangerous ' duty and did it handsomely. Wo du not owe 1 him endless coddling and spceial favors and gifts and tho great majority of him is not asking them. nR is not calllug for control ot all our affairs or easy living in idleness tor the rest of his life as return for his six months or two yoars in the army, abroad or here. Heaping the Whirlwind fyHU opposition to tho peace treaty which 1 made tho ratification of that document impossible during the past session of the Senate will feci pride in its achievement when it contemplates tho effect of its labors upon the government and people of Ger many. That opposition will realize, when it lias read and digested the news, that it has given both aid aud comfort to tho enemy; that it has stiffened ti/o back of the German iiution and has rendered it difficult, if not impossible, to exact from the vanquished the terms which the peace council has imposed. Germany has given formal notice thai it will not sign the protocol submitted to if after the peace treaty was agreed to. It. refuses to make payment for the German warships which its officers aud crews sank at Sen pa Flow. it is not disposed to sur render the officers of the army who were re sponsible for outrages in Belgium and North ern France, that they may be tried by an allied military court. The reason which the Germans give for refusing to accede to the demauds embodied in the protocol is that the United Slates Sen ate having rejected the peace treaty, Ger many no longer feels morally bound lo give in to its enemies. It takes the ground that the rejection by the Senate was accomplished because of manifest injustice to Germany, because there is a rising tide of sympathy for the German people in America, and be cause Germans believe, that with tho sup port of America withdrawn from the entente, thai group of powers will be unablo lo en force further demands. I he Senate, therefore, has accomplished something very concrete through the rejec tion of I ho treaty. The opponents of that measure boasted that their determination was to ?'Americanize" the document. It j.s Ger many s boast, on tho other hand, that the Senate has Germanized it; that the Ameri can people, speaking through their highest legislative body, have repudiated tho work or the Paris prace conference, and it is no longer incumbent upon Germany to make concessions to the allied powers. Raisins are abnormally valued aud priced now because supposed to bo able, to develop a kick, and yet the humble mule i., dis credited and mistrusted because of precisely ! the same suppositions quality. No wonder the returns from the French Chamber of Deputies elections were delayed. seeiiiK I ha I the Guy members are divided among nine parties, including five distinct varieties of Socialists. Apparently the policy now agreed on by the civilized countries is to stimulate ihu Itufjsiaus to <he establishment of a respon sible government by the process of mutual extermination.
