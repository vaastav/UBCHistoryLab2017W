It will be" remembered1 that when San Francisco and Seattle were visited with plague during the past year, the Fed eral government tdok charge and spent large sums ot money In improving the sanitary conditions, killing rats and otser like work. Tels was not done In this city, the money for this work being from the funds of the Board ot Health, which soon ran out and were then replenished bj' money obtained from the Merchants' Association through the Shippers' Wharf tax.

Sunday night's sensational auto buggy wreck was last evening tho subject of a probing bee at tho police station, Chief of Detectives iKalaklela presiding. All but the suilering victims were present. Frank Lewis, the driver of the Kis sel car which wrecked the buggy car rying Ed. Dulscnbcrg and Miss Roth was one of (ho testifiers. Fred Wright, mounted officer, who arrived after the accident, said that Jack Scully came up to him with his uuto driven by Blllie Meyers and stat ed that he had taken Duisenberg to the hospital. The auto had no num ber. Two men and two white girls were present. Otto Heine, one of the passengers In the Lewis auto, said that Meyers' machine was ahead of Lewis' and was raising a great deal of dust. When Aleyers' auto had passed the Duisen berg rig, Levis turned to the left, when the rig appeared right in front of them. Lewis sounded his horn and turned his machine to the right. The same time the rig also turned to the right and then the collision occurred. Heine estimated that both machines were going at the rate of twenty miles an hour. Ludwigsen, Jr., who was with Heine in the Lewis auto, said that the ma- chine was going on the right side o the road up to the time of colliding with the buggy, at the rate of fifteen of twenty miles an hour The colli sion was so sudden that lie could not describe it, but he remembered that the horn was tooting at the time. Frank Lewis said that, as his ma chine was passing- John Ena road, Meyers' auto was about 200 feet ahead ot his and both were going at tho rate of about 20 miles an hour. Lewis was in the middle of tho road. Just be fore the collision, Lewis saw a light on Ills left about 300 feet ahead and coming toward him. He did not see tho rig until ho was about twelve feet away and then He turned to the right and the rig turned the same di rection; Lewis explained that he could not turn to the left on account ot tho light coming toward him and, consequently, the collision occurred. No light could be seen from the buggy. After the accident the lady remarked that all tho 'occupants of the auto were drunk. There was one drunken man in the machine. Meyers testified that he had not seen Lewis' auto on his way out to Wal- klkl. Ho passed the buggy to his right, but could not see whether there was a light on it or not. He was driv ing his machine at the rate of fifteen to twenty miles an hour. Lloyd testified that he saw tho ac cident from the rapid transit car''bn the switch but could not tell at what rate of speed the autos were going, but both were going pretty fast and the buggy was going slow. It is understood that neither of the victims will prosecute. A RELIABLE REMEDY FOR CROUP.

For ILfjBFOBy Work TERRITORY TO FURNISH A LABORATORY BUILDING AT KALIH1 FOR THE FEDERAL SPECIALISTS WHO HAVE ?15,000 A YEAR WHICH MAY BE USED ON THIS ISLAND ELABORATE PREPAR ATIONS FOR SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS. The arrangements for starting the Federal leprosy work on this island at once, were the subject of a meeting this morning in the Robin's Edd Blue chamber, In which President Robin son, ot the Board of Health, Fred C. Smith, Secretary Mott-Smith, Dr. Way son and Dr. Brinckerhoff took part. The result obtained was that the Ter ritory will furnish a building for the Federal staff at the Kallhi detention station while the laboratory appara tus, medicines and salaries will be paid from tho money appropriated for the purpose of researches in this Hue by tho Federal Government. The appropriation made for this purpose by Congress Is one ot $50,000 annually and Ifls 'estimated that "only $35,000 of this Is needed for Leprosa rium work on Molokai. By a deci sion of the Comptroller of the Trea sury, made recently, it was settled 1 

HONOLULU AS YET IN THE DARK ABOUT ANY EFFECT THE ACTION OF THE GREAT COMMON CARRIER MAY HAVE ON LOCAL BUSI NESS IT CANNOT AFFECT SUGAR FREIGHT FOR SOME YEARS TO COME. Joseph P. Cooke, manager of Alex ander & Baldwin -and vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, nvas asked this morning if anything was known in Honolulu to indicate that the reported increase of rates on transcontinental freight by tho Ame rican-Hawaiian Steamship Company would affect the business of Hono lulu. In reply ho said: "So far I do not know anything about tho increase excepting what ' I havo read in tho Coast papers. Even the information there does not seem to be very definite. Perhaps there is not much in it. "I do not think the increaso If there Is one, will affect us here very much. Wo may hear something about it from Mr. Alexander In Thursday's mail." Mr. Cooko remembered, when It was mentioned, that at tho conferenco ot local business men with Captain Mat son, abont tho projected new Matson steamer, an animated side discussion took place on transcontinental freight rates with reference to favors to goods for transpacific points. In this con nection he was asked if a had situa tion might not bo produced here should Harrlman, providing it Is truo that ho is at tho back of tho American-Hawaiian increaso ot ratos, dis criminate against tho Matson Naviga tion Company in railroad ratos on merchandise bound for Hawaii. To this ho could only glvo a shako ot tho head with n remark to tho effect that fiirthor information would bo neodod to form any opinion on tho subjoct. Captain V. I.

It is understood that another physi cian, an expert on leprosy, will be add ed to tho staff here, with such other attendants as may be needed., their salaries being provided for from the Federal funds. The Territory will, for Its part, give the use of one of the cot tages at Kallhi which is now vacant, for the $15,000 mentioned cannot bo used, under the decision mentioned, for the erection of a building. It is expected that the results obtained from the work at the new station will be extremely valuable, for Dr. Brinck erhoff will be able to keep the work in very close touch with the work in this city. The Territory will take care of any patients who may be treated by the Federal men and this,- with the use of the building mentioned, will be tho only expense to the local Government. MS1I1 

RAISB OF BATES ness would be affected by any such raise of rates. Something might be learned by Thursday's mall. On a reference being made to news paper talk of late about competition on the Sound route, Captain Morse said thero was no need of worry on tho part of the Amefican-Hawallan. It maintained a fourteen-day Sound service as against a forty-five day ser vice by tho Matson company. E. E. Paxton did not think, when spoken to, that there was any Imme diate menace to business in Honolulu In tho reports of tho Intended nctlon of tho American-Hawaiian company. At nil events, it would not affect tho cost of sugar transportation by the Tehuantepee route, as tho existing contract betwn tho planters and tho steamship company had several years to run. It will bo noticed, in the San Fran cisco account of the freight increaso elsowhoro in this paper, that Hawall nn sugar is mentioned as a highly lu crative source of tho American-Hawaiian's revenue. Also it will bo per ceived that San Francisco merchants aro much worked up over tho propos ed Increaso of transcontinental freight ratos by the company mentioned, which until now has been their savior from oxtortlonnto railroad carriage at. woll as a most expeditions carrier of their merchandise.
