Main Street W W Ilayward Agent Waco Percy Burleson Agent Texas has 25000000 acres of the finest public lands which will be sold to actual bona fide settlers at from S2 to S4 an acre on forty years time at a low rate ofinterest Immigration or retrogression Let us have good county roads Another railroad will soon reach Port Worth Let the dead past bury its dead and all work for Texas now Hon W S Pendleton seems to have struck the key note on the county road question The railroads of Texas would be the first to realize benefit from an influx of people into the state Tennessee has a town named Wart race Ifyoulikeit call it Wartrace If not call it Wartrace The unanimity of the press and people of Texas on the question of immigration means that a boom is coming It is painful to note that no one will be deterred from running for the Legislature by the insecurity of the capitol building A one cent rate to Dallas for people who wish to engage in an effort to build hd Texas ought to be as profitable to the f ra i l w railroads b a six dollarroundtrip ticket from Fort Worth to Galveston in the sum mer season According to Mr Blaine tobacco is a necessity and woolen fabrics are luxuries to the working man and his wife and children A one cent a mile rate to the coming Dallas convention will fill our sister city with more people than she has 6een in many a day John Sherman strange to sayis not at all satisfied with Clevelands message If it is such a sorry document Mr Sherman should be pleased Any good hand who can form a minis try that will hold water can secure a good paying job by apolying to President Sadi Carnot Paris France The waterworks are all right With competent management the service can as satisfactory as any private corporation could make it One cent a mile fare to the Dallas meeting would be an earnest of the sym pathy of the railroads with the people in this movement to benefit the state If thk tariff protects American labor the coal diggers of Pennsylvania ought to be millionaires by this time instead of being hard pressed to exist on their wages as they are As long as human nature is human nature there will be mistakes made As long as human nature is human nature no mistake can be corrected or remedied by another mistake The negro who is held in Dallas charged with the sensational assault on the now Mrs Barlow ought to be liberated in all conscience Making a farce of justice is wrong Do not confuse the discussion in Texas j by charges and countercharges We all know that the depression is a fact and we should all cooperate in a movement to put the state in a situation to compete with Kansas California and other states The whitesouled Hoar wants the women to be allowed to vote If his bill becomes a law The Gazette will nomi nate Francis Folsom Cleveland for President and move the nominations for President close Do we hear a second Did it ever occur to anyone that Con gressman Martin has expressed himself sir as being entirely satisfied sir with the Presidents message sir A motion to have Mr Cleveland hold over and save the expenses of an election is now in order That competition is the life of trade is a maxim as old as business itself Pools prevent competition Texas is stagnant and if the pool stands in the way of an effort to unite the railroads and the people let the pool rather than Texas die When the fact that certain Texas rail roads were placed in the hands of receiv ers is urged as a reason why those roads could no longer expend money for adver tising Texas let it be remembered tbat the people of Texas did not forcethe roads Into the hands of receivers We have the authority of the Louisville CourierJournal for the statement that the man who is accustomed to whisky wants ii just as much as the man who is accustomed to tobacco wants tobacco The Kentucklau who would not throw away a chew of tobacco In order to secure a threefinger drink of whisky is a libel on his state Republican members are already in troducing buncombe bills They want the men who fought in the Federal army during the war to receive 8 per month pension As thousands of theGe soldiers were ninety day men who never saw the smoke of battle the proposition to pay them and ruin the country is not likely to meet with much favor Like a thunderbolt from a clear sky comes the announcement that Higgins is going to resign The man that the entire Republican party tried to drive from office and who withstood an almost na tional opposition is going to do of his own accord what the world could not compel him to do It is like a man com mitting suicide after successfully dodging the bullets of a whole army Kansas City has a gentleman named Corrigan who has undertaken to whipout beat and walked over one of the local staff of the Times and afterwards sent the editor home with a badly broken up anat omy besides taking his pistol away from him What Kansas City editors require Is not a pistolbut one of the paper weights used by Waco editors during the prohibi tion campaign If the railroads are not too much en gaged in providing transportation for people leaving Texas for California at 115 cents per mile they would do a handsome thing by giving the people of Texas a rate of 1 cent a mile to Dallas on the 20th inst At that meeting It is proposed to discuss ways end means to bring people Into Texas from other states and thus benefit the railroads as well as the people of the state The advocates of a nation with a big N are again heard from this time as advo cates of a national marriage law The state is not to have anything to say in the mti 29 3 ff s t < 3St e HrF Bi p55e7T matter Of course the idea is to make the intermarriage of the races legal in the southern states If the eastern people desire to absorb the colored element they must do so by giving their own daughters in marriage The southern people will never submit to it The colored people of the south who have any race pride at all do not desire Intermarriage neither do the whites It is an election that will never materialize dodge The railroads lost one opportunity at the time of the New Orleans exposition when they were requested to make ex cursion rates to Texas from the Crescent city They should not lose another The people of Texas are wrought up over the matter now being discussed Do the roads ever consider that If the public en treaty Is denied legislation may be in voked to destroy that whfoh destroys com petition II Texas can have an equal chance with other states the people will care nothing for the pool but if the pool stands in the way at this juncture and insists on discriminating against Texas then it will be all the worse for tne pool The present immigration movement in Ttxas is no war on railroads and rail foad men who seek to create that im pression are very unwise Some of the best friends Texas railroads ever had are prominent in this movement men in deed who have been denounced as rail road hirelings for opposing excessive verdicts and harsh legislation against railroads The bestj and truest and wisest friend to railroads is he who di rects their attention to the terrible earn estness of the people in the present movement to lift Texas up and place it on a plane of equality with competing states The Gazette is In receipt of the fol lowing letter and craves the pardon of the writer for

BETVBN TO FBAGTIONAL CUB BENGY The United States Postal Improvement Association is the name of an organiza tion that has been formed to promote the reissue of fractional currency and also to secure a reduction in the postage on seeds and plants Every planter now has to pay a tax of sixteen cents per pound on seeds bulbs and cions as that is the postage on this class of mail matter It is desired to have seeds and plants classed as thirdclass mail matter and subject to a rate of postage of one cent for each two ounces or eight cents per pound The rate in Canada is only four cents per pound Any plan that will facilitate the dissemination of plants and seeds is for the universal good of the nation and will be supported by ninetenths of our population Inci dentally it is desired to abolish the pres ent postal note system and substitute therefor money orders for 5 or less at a charge of > cents The value and im portance of this great facility to the mail business of the country will be generally recognized We heartily indorse this movement to increase our postal facilities We urge all of our readers to immediately write to their representatives in both branches of Congress to give this matter their earnest and cordial support The value of these personal letters to Congressmen from their constituents cannot be over estimated If this is followed up by all the in the He I newspaper men country circulation of petitions in be half of these measures success will be assured The National Grange in session at Lansing Mich unanimously voted on Monday to help this work for postal im provement in every possible and legiti mate way Success is certain if every one in favor of these ideas will take hold in earnest There is continually an increasing evi dence that the people desire the reissue of fractional currency At present a large mcjority of our citizens are hindered in making remittances in sums less than 1 very much to their discomfort and dis satisfaction Either postage stamps or postal notes must be used In most cases distance from the nearest money order postoffice renders it difficult to secure the postal note while postage stamps are not intended as a circulating medium and are noF negotiable Moreover postal notes being issued at only about 14 per cent of the postoffices in the country are difficult to obtain f fe 1S v THE
