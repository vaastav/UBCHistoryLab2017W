In thuhouso only live membeis nerc absent. Tlic throng nf spectators in the house looked down upon a stirring , noNy cene. In the senate the v i.sitors saw unreal deal otordor and dignity. The greatest interest was manifested fn the proceedings of Uiu house , although people who loohi'd down > on the grey licndo In thu Konatc seemed to he highly unlciialncd with thu rigid ilecoinm they saw theic. There was a great crowd on the lloor ot the house. There wcie notorious lobbyists , prominent ex-members In the laughing and talking throng , well known ilgntus of the house were there , and new members who have already attracted attention either by defeating old member0 , or for having uttalned fame in some other \\ny , were there. Jlr. KasMin , who was minister to Austria some t line IIKO , was prf-enf , wearing nn over- eoat with an liniiien > e fur collar , "Itiche- lieu" llohlnson , with his abundant locks of waving white hair and benevolent fiiee w.is present. lie Is not a member "f this con gress but attracted as much attention as any limn on thoiloor. .Mr. Kandnll wan early In the seat he has occupied for ten years , ex cept during the period he was speaker. He Mas in a Milt of clerical black , with a piofes- gionnl crumpled shirt front seeking wider liberty outside hid vest. Mr. llolmau. \vilh his clean cut features and grcv beard , sat quietly In his favorite seat. Mr. Pulitzer , of New York , with tils keen fiwo and dark hair brushed up on end alter the fiiPhlon of a German student , was .read- i . j his own paper in a corner and was not much observed by members. Perry Uelninut looked like a clwart beside a bin New Yorker , frith whom ho was talking. Tom ISecd , ot Maine , who was chosen in the republican ( MUCUS to be the leader of his party on thu floor , sat on a sola In the lobby , his fat moon face wrinkled in a laugh. " 1'ig Iron" Kelley - ley , tattler of the house , was in the -eat he has occupied for j ears. Hu is not old In look.

Hetore the clerk began to call the roll he inked cveiy one not entitled to the privil- edgcsofthe lloor to rctiie whilu the names were helm ; walled. The new members sat up In their seats like new bojs in a strange school , but the old members dropped into comfortable positions and many of them read newspapers. At the conclusion of roll call the clerk announced tHO members were pres ent , and the next thins in order was the se lection ot a * p < > al < er. K.inilolph Tucker ot Virginia , who sat back near the door on the democratic side , ro-u lii.s mrdiiun height with gray hair and beaid and rubicund face. Ha simply Mated he nominated John G. Carlisle , member elect liom Kentucky. /\s / ho took bin seat Frank His- cock iind ilr. Cannon of Illinois rose. The eleik recognized Mr. Cannon , and ho stated that he nomiuated Thomas 15. Heed of Elaine , and then sat down. Nothing bettor il lustrates the husincss-like-way the housodoe.s things. Tlieio were no eulogies of candi date , and no applause. The clerks began to cHll the roll at ouce. That took an hour or more-ami there was a noisy hum dining the piocess. At- last It-was iini he It - - i. wa * announced that !

Thu three walked down the main aisle , and turning to the left approached the steps to the speaker's desk. ilr. Carlisle looked like a sick man. There was jm or on his face. Ho wore a black Prince Albeit and iiwhltevest , IK * has cue of the line.st faces in thu whole body. His voice Is deep ami lieh , but to-day It was tremulous unu faint at times. Hu has the modulating of a pieaeher , aud sometimes his enunciation isIikoMHiio clergyman's half-singing , half- readintr of a hymn. Sam Itandall Middled In his -cat , folded his arms nnd kept his cold grey eyes on Mr. Citrlisle. Some ol the men on the democratic yl-.li ! leaned forward and put thu palm of their bunds back of their ears to catch every t-vllabli ) of their leaders discourse.

Then Anson Jlel'ool ; stood in the doorway aud read three communications. Ono that the nenatc was In session ; another ttuit Sherman had bean elected president pro tern , mid the Ihiid that a committee had JxHin appointed to go with a like committee of the house to tell the president that con gress was In session.

The chamber piescnted a pleasant scene the bright led carpet lending an air of cheeri ness and waunlh to thu hall , which has been thoroughly renovated since last spring , while a number of desks , including the speaker's , wcredecoratcd with llovvers. Heie and there groups of members werechattiug nnd fatten ing , politlcalanimosiiles being set aside tor tlie time being , while membeis took advan tage ot thu occasion to extend an ac quaintance among the older and more experienced colleagues. The chief part of conversation was the change of rules. The galleries were crowded , with thu exception of the executive gallery , which was only par tially tilled. A majority of thespectatois were ladies. At noon the house was called to order by J. 13. Clark , clerk , and the hrst session of "tlie Forty-ninth congress besran. When order was secured , he proceeded to call the roll of members-elect. While the roll was being called , Jlr. Page walked down the aislu bearing In MR arms' a huge lloral design , representing ! pertion ot u canal navigated by a canal boat laden with diminutive basis of grain , the whole being Inscribed "Hennepln. " As he placed it on the desk of Jlr. Murphy , of Iowa , the especial champion of thu Hennipin canal project , the house broke forth into applause ami laughter. The call disclosed thu presence of 3 0 mem ber * the only absentees being Messrs. Miller , of New York , Henderson , of North Carolina , Aikcn , of South Carotins , Craig , ot Texas , aud Ciclghtou , of Virgin- la. Nominations for speaker were then In order , nnd Tucket , of Virginia , presented the name of Jlr. Carlisle of Ken tucky. Mr. Cannon , of Illinois then placed Jfr. Heed , of .Maine , in nomination.

McDonald aud Itetd as a committee to conduct the speaker to tlio chair. On taking the chair Mr. Carlisle said : Gentlemen of theHoiibOof Representatives : In assuming the duties and responsibilities of lids place for the second time 1 beg to icturn my most profound thanks for the manifesta tions of your continued confidence. It is a compliment which I shall always remember with pride and gratitude. Nowhere else In the woihl can bo found a legislative assembly which leprcscnts so great a constituency as that represented by this house. Certainly no similar body consisting ol an equal number of members Is its superior in point of ability nnd devotion to the inteicsts en trusted to it. The privilege of pre siding over the deliberations of such a body Is a very high and honorahle distinction , the highest and most honorably it can con fer upon any of Its members. I appreciate It as such ; but gentlemen my lull apmeuiation of your action to-day can best bu shown by a conscientious , Impartial discharge of my olllcial duty. Although it may not be wise to make pledges in advance , I vent me to promise that to the fullest extent of my abili ty , the law governing tliu proceedings of the house shall bo evenly administered. Wo are about to enter upon th work nf an Important session , mom important perhaps than any that hns preceded it for many years. Thu political relations heictoforo existing between the two -ides of thu house and t'te executive department of Uiu government havu been reversed and this ot Itself will Im- po e now duties and obligations. Under a popular form of government like ours a po litical change in tlie executive branch neces sarily to a greater or less c\tuut involveal tered methods of administration , inaugurates a nv legislative poll y and eons eminently prcsitnU now questions for the considera tion of tin ) pconKi and their representative * . It It , jioisibfu , therefore , that many suhiecU not hcietofoio i romiucnt in our delibera tions will eugage a largo share of your atten tion during thu present congiess It may reasonably bu aiithlpatcd also that wiutt. dltlcumi-cs of opinion will < t\Kl on ninny of thu questions , resulting in Innr ; earnest and perhaps exciting contents on the lloor , and It may bo that these diiferenees will not always hu dnilucd by reconi/.ed patty linos. Under these ciicuiin-tanuc : > a uioper appreciation of the Integrity and mtriotlsm of each other , a sincere respeotfor tliu hone.it opinions of opponents in debate , and ihu cultivation of n spirit of mutual tor- hcainucu will b nwe-'wry to enable tliu house to conduct its prnm-ulngs with order and deliberation , and avoid unpleasant inei- ' -which am always , in my experience at ; , mo.st seriously regretted by those wno participate in them. And now , gentlemen , before taking tlie o.Uhof olJicp , allow me to lenew thu exme-i- bloimuf mybiiu-eru acknowledgment of Urn great honor you Jiavo conterrcd and the great trust you have eon tided to my hands.

The Herald's Dublin correspondent tele graphs a long interview with Parnell on the election. Referring to the position of Ire land in the new paillamcnt , Parnell says : "I look for the settlement of the nationalist qnestlou to the liberals , rather than to tories , assuming that the tories and nationalists combined about equal.to thu liberals. It will be possible for us , by voting with the liberals to give them a majority of 170 upon this or any other question a majority such as no English government has ever had , and ona amply sulUclent to niaku up for the score ol possible whig detections. 1 do not regard thu formation of a coalition govern ment as at all likely or that It would last long.

HEC.J The president's message which wil be a long one , will not be ent io congress before Ttuj > day. lleuce the two houses will do no more than organize to-day and ad journ. Those who have read the message say it Is a conscrvatl\ document , though on some ( lucstlons the president is decided In his views. lie has not changed his opinions on the silver question , but will leiteratu them fts expressed In his lirst "message1 written befoie he was Inaugurated. It does not appear now unless some new compromise is sug ge ted. that the democrats In the house wilt be any more likely to adopt thu president's views tiian they were last winter. On the tariff he Is represented as conserva * tive , but In favor of some modiilcation of ex istiug laws , conttnlng .Mich tilings ns him. her and salt to the free Hat and recommending changes that will remove the ambiguities in the present law. The message is outspoken on the civil scr. vice reform question , the president expicss Ing his purpose to extend tlic system to at branches of the public rei vice. No attempt however , Is made to explain how the appoint , inent of such men as Illegins , Troup , Chase lledden , and others comports with his pro fcsslons. Legislation in behalf of national banks is also recommended with the withdrawal of silver and other eertiucates. Notwithstanding Tildeu's letter , the presi dent does not give any prominence to the question of sea coast defenses ; hut urges thu Importance of providing liberally for the re building of the navy. As to how this should be doue , he docs not say. The president agrees \ylth Secietary Lamar In recommending that the Indian reserva tions IK ; reduced to proper size , and that a part of each remaining reservation be. divided into suitable tracts for farms and allotted in .severally to the Indians , but not compehltn : the Indians at once to abandon tribal rela tions. U should , he thiuk.s..bc gradual work. lie is not In favor ot dividing all lands in severally , nor gathering all Indians in one territory. lie thinks , liberal provisions should-be made for educating them In a prac tical way on their resHTatabns.

In this he disagrees with thu fast confess.

Tne postponement of legislation until thu last of the session is idso mentioned as im provident. lie condemns the policy of accu mulating millions of Useless , and in his opin ion , unnecessary suiplus in the national treasury , which , he says , bus been not less a tas beiaaseit was indirectly but surely all to the cost uf the people's lle. ! lle.-avs that the policy ot the government should bu to caie lor the people's needs a they actually urisu and the application of remedies as wrongs ap pear.

Altogether the message makes oO.OOO words. The Kcmcdy With Congress. 

WASHISGTO.V , Dec. 7. The supreme court to-day decided Case No , 000 , the Northern Pa' eitic Railway company appellant , from the Mipicino court of Dakota. The suit was brought In the district court of Trail countyi Dakota , by the present appellant against Ivor L. Bockner , treasurer of the county , to enjoin him from enforcing the collection of taxes assessed on tlic lands ot' the company in that county. Tlie verdict was for thu defendant , and the supreme court of theteriltory attirmed the Judgment. This comt now reverses the Judgment , and the case Is remanded with directions to cause u decree to be entered perpetually enjoining the treasurer of Trail county irom any further proceedings to col lect thu tax. This action is bafed upon the provisions of an act of eougiess which prohibits thu con veyance ul any granted landh to thu com pany until the costs of the simey have been paid to the government. Until these costs havu been paid the government retains title as security , and this security would be neutralized ii the lands could be told for taxes.
