President C'ilHtru ni' Venezuela maintains Iiíh composure In tile face of alarming reports pub lished here regarding the disturbances in Venezuela. When dispatches were shown to him today th,;t the people if Curacas had arisen against liim, burn ed the pictures and statues of the president in the publie squares and inni made an attack on a number of public buildings, including the .stoles of some of his warmest adherents, and that several persons had been killed, President Castro said: "I don't believe It. I had dispatches fivum Caracas this morning, but they mention nothing of the kind." Castro was nuked lor an expression of his views regarding Holland's sclz , lire of Venezuelan ships, but referred the correspondent to Señor Veloz Gait ii oa, Venezuelan charge d'affaires, whom he authorized to talk for him. The charge then said: "1 doubt what lias been publisher! with regard to Holland's aggression, because no declaration of war has been made, nor has a blockade been announced, and none been established. Therefore the seizure of small Vene zuela vessels by sheer force can not be described other than as an act of piracy unworthy of any enlightened civilized country. "On the other hand,, such a course would jeopardize the arrangements which Venezuela has proposed to Holland through confidential agents, .and could even have n worse effect, inasmuch us Venezuela in meeting payments due to Holland, takes for that purpose a portion of the pre scribed 30 per cent of the customs re ceipts. Thus '"Holland's act might place Venezuela in a position of being unable to continue payments, which also would jeopardize the interests of other nations. Holland is 1n the w rong I .and is still more involved through the j attitude which the Dutch government recently bus adopted. "In view of this, the Venezuelan government lias Informed the diplo matic corps at Caracas of these facts ami is waiting before taking any fur ther steps." 

WILL REST CONTENT WITH CUSTODY OF CHILDREN Letter to Counsel Filled With Indignant Protest Against Mercenary Interpretation of His Action Against De Sagans Ily Morning Journal Siflul T.mad Wire) Paris. Dec. 10. The last day of the hearing of the suit drought by Count Boui de Castellane against his former wife, tile Princess De Sagan, formerly Anna anuid, in which he petitions th court to award the custody of his three children to his mother, the Mar quise do Castellane, brought out th fact that the count had withdrawn his demand that the court allow him yearly income of $GO,U0O for keeping ing the childlell. M. lioniiKlt. speaking for the count read a letter from ills client filled with Indignant protests that he should have been charged with instituting the pro ceedings to obtain money and in which the count abandoned his claim for the allowance. He insisted that his only object in wanting the children was his solicitude for their moral nnd SURGEONS TESTIFY IN pnysicai wenare. make n still more unfortunate mar rlnge ."' asked M. lionnett. "No, can reassure him; the princess can tind nobody worse than De Sagan." The lawyer then asked the court to order the taking of testimony on points which the defense had decided to meet. In conclusion, he appeal to the court to withdraw the thr children from the custody of their mother who had married a man re llnuneed by one of the proudest faml lies of France anil who "bad spent I month In prison" and place them in the case of the mother of the count whose only purpose was to direct her grandchildren in the tight path. Speaking of tlie princess ,1. Clemen "an characterized de Castellane'? change of attitude on the money qu lion as a "gallery play" Induced b his tardy npppeclntion of the unpre cedented character of his demand for an allowance of $60,000 a year, and the severity with which the publie had ridiculed him. Touching tin count's .statement that lie renounced his claim "with pleasure" tin- lawy innounced : "If the count took such pleasure In renouncing this demand why did hi ever formulate It? M. Clemenceau justified the Inter vent ion of George Gould on the ground Of his sister's Interests, and said he could not understand why Mr. Gould was the object of such violent at tacks He denounced (. astellane s con duct during tile period of bis mar riage. The count, ho said, should have been irreproachable in order lo avoid the insinuation that lie had married Miss Gould for her money. The law yer then reminded the court that the real battle was between two men Count (le Castellane and Prince Ilolln De Silgan, who hated each other. M. ( lemenceau concluded by saying that the Princess De Sagan had not forfeited any of the confidence re posed in her when the court gave her the custody of her three children and he asked the court to maintain Ills client in his rights. A iMTHi n:i) mom svi:i:is h i n di in ;d ovi;n city Caracas, Monday (via Willemstad, Dee. 16). The people of Caracas rose today against President Castro. An infuriated mob, unhindered by the pullcc, swept through the city, wrecking the property of Castro's henchmen and closest friends. The people rounded up all the pictures of Castro from the clubs and semi-public buildings and burned them on the lloulevard de Plaza. President Cas tro's rule in Venezuela Is probably ended. Further dangerous demonstrations aie anticipated. No official act de Posing Castro from the presidency has .Vet in i n passed, but sue), a step is ex pected at any moment. At: enormous crowd, composed of Inhabitants of the capital and swelled by people from the coast towns, gath ered in the streets of the city shortly after daybreak. The people began inarching up and down the thorough files and it was easy to see that their ill temper would soon result in vio lence. The police stood by and made lie altcmp! to restrain the mob. In spite of Holland's warlike dem onstration on the coast there has been lio demonstration against the Nether lands. All the demonstrations here are against Castro und Acting Presi dent Gomez.

Tile Dead. iioss if. mcKty... I G. X1KYF.KS. GKORGR STIFF. 'HAllLBrt GI SSLKR. Two of the Injured are In serious r"ialition. The men were employes f the Pennsylvania steel company .It is evident that the count has rec ognized that his claim for the larg allowance has injured his case in the eyes of the court and the estimation of the publie und his tardy renuncia tion is considered a clever move to enlist sympathy in his favor. Never theless the public is greatly astonish ed that the count shorn go to such extreme. The proceedings were filled with al legations from both sides. The pub lic prosecutor will present his conclu sions next week and the court will then render Its decision. It will either dismiss the count's plea or grant him the custody of the children or, if doubt i;-.lsts, will order the taking of test! mony. The Princess De Sagan continues to be sanguine of a favorable decision The letter of the count Is addressed to M. lionnett and it Is couched In an elaborate phraseology of outraged manned. It begins "Indignant at th perfidious and lying Insinuations of the princess and her family repre senting mv only desire is to obtain big allowance and I now ask for my self and mother only tin custody of the children: I renounce with pleasure the request for an allowance." Continuing the count calls M. lion mtt to witness with what outraged feelings he rejected the pecuniary of. fers of the prince and Princess Di Sagan and George Gould, the prill. cess brother. "The new nnd unex pected attitude of George Gould." Di Castellane writes, "who regards this suit simply as a vulgar affair of money and who believes that his gohieri au thority can gild the marriage of his sister Willi a tarnished man, compels me more strongly than ever to Insist on the withdrawal of the children from the house of which the prince 1 the ornament and from surroundings where they will learn only one thing that honor Is nothing and money is everything; that money covers every baseness and that it will buy every conscience. "The decision I have taken will show the court the sole purpose which Inspires no, my parents and my relatives. We are without for tune but upon the question of money we don't hold the same theories as do the Goulds; concerning the education of French youths we have other ideas than those of the De Sagans. My par ents will aid me to bring up these three Innocent victims. After asking the court to take note of the modil'uation of the petition of his clb nt. M. lionnett launched into i vigorous denunciation of his ad versaries. He charged that on many points, the defendants did not dare to meet the allegations of the count, cit ing particularly the allegation that the Princess De Sagan was ready to leave her present husband. "They dn not dare challenge this statement." Ihe lawyer said, "because they know that the proposed separation lias been formally communicated to de Cast el lane's attorneys." Continuing M. lionnett sai I thnt all the offers of settlement made by the Princess Sagan were conditioned upon tlie ci unt's renunciation of his children but the count refused to sell either himself or his rhiloren. The princess had told Judge Ditto that If the children were taken from her she would disinherit them, thus proving her eyes everything was a of mom y. Referring to the charges that de Castellane hid dissipated his wife's fortune M. Ponnett insisted that the countess was j'it as much respmisiblt as her husband for the "royal ex travagance" such as the MalnkofT pal ace, the Chateau Marals and the char ity bazaar, w hich alone cost $3iH1.00rt. The lawyer particularly resented George Gould's share in the defense, saying that now that the question of money had been eiminated, Mr. Gould was plating the myst.rl. it role of Crawford in the Humbert affair. As i matter of fad. Mr. Guild always had opposed the manage of his sis ter to the Pri', e De S.igan and he only finally consented on condition that there vhotild be a separation of prop erty.

KOREAN MURDER CASE San Francisco, Dec. 16. The line of defense to he employed of In Whang Chang, tlie Korean charged with the murder of Durham White Stevens of the Jaiianase diplomatic service, has not yet been indicated by the attor neys representing tin' defendant. Most of the day was taken up with the prosecution still presenting the testi mony of physicians and surgeons who had attendeil Mr. Stevens prior to his death. Autopsy Surgeon C. S. Clark, who made the examination of the body, stated that in his opinion death was due to peritonitis following tlie Millet wounds, lie wi.S elos-.ty cvc-j examined in an eiiort to establish whether or not the wound showed evi dence of due skill and care on the part of the ulleniling surgeons. The most Important witness call ed by the prosecution today was Carry Sexton, collector of oriental taxes. He described how he captured In Whang Chang as tlie man who did the shoot ing. He ulso told of the Identification f Chang by Stevens in the hospital shortly before his death. On this oc casion, tile witness said, Cluing had remarked of Stevens; "He, bad man to my country."

RESOLUTION CALLING FOR INQUIRY ADOPTED Secret Service Portion of Roosevelt Message Described as Deliberate and Studied In sult to Nation's Lawmakers (Ily Morning Journal BpocImI 1kiI Wlrel Washington, Dec. 16. The senate oday decided definitely to enter upon investigation relative to the por tion of the annual message of the president which criticises the action f congress In prohibiting the detail f secret service men to duty in other epnrtmonts. The resolution directing the inquiry had been made in contemplation ever since the message was received on 'iiesday of last week but there had ecu some difficulty In arriving at the rrms in which it should lie couched nd in agreeing upon tlie proper per ón to Introduce It. It was at last ecided that Senator Aldrich should taud sponsor for the measure and day alter Senator Dodge had com leted his speech on the 1 III. Wlisvi I le flair, the Rhode Island senator took floor and presented a resolution uthorizing the Inquiry. Senator Culberson, the leader of the mocrais, iniiiiediat!v sent up a sub titule which wn ,'i'T-ewhnt more Rpoeilic. Roth measures were promptly re ferred to the committee on contingent expenses and almost immediati I y af terward Senator Kcan from that com mittee reported back the Aldrich resolution with a recommendation that such, and actually engaged in cm plov meiit as Uibotvrs."

If any, in tlie Judgment of the committee the senate should take in the matter. .ir. tiain v objected to tlie recom mendation been us,, it des led direct the committee to Inquire into tin "very gross and wanton" winds of tin president's message. "So far as I am concerned," he said no action should be taken on that resolution until that point Is covered lOilher congress is the most imlnniou body that ever assembled in any conn iry of tin. world or It will take im notice of this most wanton and gros insult ever given anybody In tie world." Mr. Aldrich Insisted that the roso ution prevlibd for just what Mr lailey advocated but the senator from Texas retorted that If that was inclinl ed In the resolution It was In a mill form. Mr. Hale declared tlie n solution was sufficiently strong worded to p nut tlie committee on appropriations In make the kiinl of report desired liv Mr. Hailey. "I would like to Inquire of the sen ltor from Maine," Interposed Mr. Till- hiin ."whether he thinks the senate has been insulted." Mr. Hale Insisted that every one had his own opinion on that subject and uu.v one was us able as he to form an opinion. Mr. Tillman Insisted that owing to the president's: message congress Is composed of a lot of "rascals and scoundrels who belong in the peniten tiary." Mr. Hale replied that there had been u great deal of "restlessness and indignation In the senate." "There is no restlessness at the White House." retorted Mr. Tillman. "They are contení and calm as can be there." Mr. Culberson said the message was a "deliberate, studied and gratuitous Insult to the congress" by the presi dent. Senator Newiands declared the ques tion at issue was whether the secret service had been used to investígale congressmen In Hie pursuance of their legislative duties or was only to de- i loot frauds In the duties devolving upon executive departments. Air. Newiands said lie was not at tempting to apologize for the presl dent but wanted to have the senate ivoiil any hasty or Improper language nil' resolution was passed without a roll call.

Y., lire. Hi The story of the slaying of William K. Annls as he sat In his cut boat and was riddled with buliels, was today made part of the record in the trial of Thornton J Mains, a magazine writer, charged with being a principal with his broth- r, Captain Peter C. Hains, Jr., In the murder of Annls last summer. Tracing the movements of the prin- ilpals at the H.iyside Yacht club trag- dy with the aid of miniature irr;j lig ares and model of the llout anil its at boat J'am, Kdwin Andrews, a yacht club member, showed under ex amination how tlie army captain standing on the Iloat's edge held aloft the obscuring boom and sail of Annis' boat nnd shot the publisher as he sat at Ihe tiller. There was surprise when It was learned that John Tun ning, a Swedish boatman wno saw the tragedy, could not be located. Dis trict Attorney Darrln said he thought Tonning was in Swedi n nothing hail been heard since last September. "He was an important witness for us," said Lawyer Mclntyre, "for through him we would have shown that he struck Captain Hains after the shooting with a boat hook or oar and to protect his brother. Thornton Hains drew his revolver." The cross examination or Andrews consumed the most part of the after noon and Lawyer MclnDre sought to develop that Thornton Hains had paid after the tragedy that he had tried to dissuade Captain Hains from bis act and that he would detain him un til the officers came. Special Prosecutor White declared evidence would be brought out to show that Thornton Hains had full knowledge of bis brother's intention to kill Annis and virtually led the way to the yacht Hub and diroi t"d the search for the publisher. Mr. White declared that Thornton Hains pointed his revolver at Mm. Annls and prevented her from troinar to the aid of her Wounded husband j it pass. Senator prompt objection a timo as if the i. subject would be morrow. Initially the democrats made it known that tiny would interpose no objection to the immediate considera tion of the Aldrich resolution if tin portion of the Culberson substitute di recting the committee on appropria tions to advise the senate spccllically I as to the course of action it should take with reference to the message could be incorporated In it. The resolution was again, refined to tlie committee on contingent ex penses and Chairman Kcan of thai committee was prompt In reporting a recommendation for the adoption of the Aldrich resolution with the addi tion of tlie Culberson provision. Af ter a very animated discussion Ihe resolution was adopte) without divis ion und thus ttie Inquiry was decided upon. The resold "U was amended and adopted as follows: "Kesolved thai that portion of the inniial message of the president re lating to the secret service Is hereby referred to the committer" on appro, priations who are instructed to inquire whether the legislation referred to In the message has impaired the effi ciency or sufficiency of the force em ployed in the secret service; and such committee are further directed to as certain what persons oilier than those included In the secret service weii paid from the public treasury for the fiscal year ende.' .lane nil, Iluix. for services in rnn'.'ci tion with the en forcement of thw laws or for work In the detection or Investigation, of pos sible crimes r.r criminal nets or vio lations of thr: law. including all spe cial attorneys', special agents.
