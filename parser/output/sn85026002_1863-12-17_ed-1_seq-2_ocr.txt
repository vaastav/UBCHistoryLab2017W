THOMAS JEFFERSON. John Morgan. The telegraph informs us that this re doubtable rebel chieftain has arrived at Richmond, and will soon again be on the "war path," having been assigned to a command in Georgia. XLovejoy's bill, of which he gave notice on the first dy of the session, pro vides that "nil slaves free by the Emanci pation Proclamation of January 1, or by the act of Congress, shall be declared to be citizens, and competent mitnetsti in the United States courts." So we go. If made "citizens" and competent witnesses in the oourts, of course they will be made voters, aud put on political equality with white men. The negro is the coining man. White men are now forced to labor, pay taxes ami go to war, all for the negro. If it suits them to do so, why let them drive along. Volunteers. If all those orntors and writers who now waste their breath and their ink in urgent ap peals totlieT fellow citizens to come forward and sacrifice themselves and tlmir families, would at once enroll their names as privates, don Uncle Sam's uniform, shoulder a musket and rush to the held, recruiting would no Ion ger languish and the ranks of tha army would soon be orcrtlowing with men whose Hearts are in the "cause," and who could not fad to "win the bubble reimtation at the cannon's mouth " Exchange. That's bo. Let all those who are so urgent that othe'rs should go to war. stop their prating and go themselves, and there will be no need of a diaft. And if they are too cowardly to go themselves they ought to blush for very shame to ask any ono else to do so. Let them prove their do votion by enlisting at once and all men will commend their action. Jt"A correspondent of the New York Tribune, who would not be likely to over draw a picture of the kind he attempts to paint, writes from Chattanooga as follows of the Federal soldiery : ' After the battle of Cblcamauga and the falling back of our army to Chattanooga, a thorough and indiscriminate system ot forag ing was instituted. For fifty and seventy- hve miles foraging turtles swept up every thing. Their conduct was regulated by no rule but to get everything. It was not for aging, .bnt merciless, indiscriminate, auducious robbery of every family of the lost peck of cjr'i,'.)! ma las, pnnni ot bacon, ot the last cow, the last sheen, the last hog, the very last morsel of subsistence. It was robbery as only soldiers can rob: and not unfrequently ths bedding and clothing were taken from the house. A thiaving soldier will steal the last crumb from a si-k badv's skeleton Gngers, and if this was not done it was because the crumb had been stolen before! This is what is called a great "war for the Onion." Commutation. There is no doubt that the three hundred dollar clause should be speedily repealed. In place of it there should be a commutation of twenty-five dollars for those who have no property but their labor, and at least three per cent, of their wealth additional for all who have property, or else no commutation at alt. Either of these, as regards military service, would place the rich and poor on a level be fore the law. And law should be no respecter of persons I Syracute Union. We endorse the above except that por tion which would have no commutation ' at all. If there was no commutation at all, it would give the rich a very decided advantage over the poor, The only ex emption then would be through substitutes. abd the average price of those would pro bably be one thousand dollars or more. The rich could afford to pay thut sum, even more to keep out of the army, while the poor man who might perhaps be able in some way to paythe present exemption, unjust as it is, could not possibly pay for substitute. If there is to be no commu tation at all, we would be In favor also doing away with the substitute system, and requiring every matt drafted to go, unless exempt by physical disability, or for other reasons now allowed. Lovejoy's Bill. prva.ro. bis and a synopsis of the provisos of Lovejoy's Bill for the abolition of Slavery, already re' ferred to : Whisks, The Declaration of Indepen dence declares all men equal, endowed hy their Creator with inalienable rights to lire, liberty, and the fruits of an honest toil; and Wakseas, the Uovernmeni oi ine unnen States was instituted to secure this riht, and WhkreaS. The Constitution or the United Stale declares that ao person shall be deprved of liberty without due process of law, and also declares (Article 6, clause 3il,) as follows : "This Constitution and the laws of the Uni ted States, made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land, and judges for every State shall be bound thereby, any:hing in the Constitution ana laws ot any mate to the contrary notwithstanding," and Wbsrkas. It has been demonstrated by the rebellion that Slavery is absolutely incompati ble with the Union, peace and welfare, for which Congress are to provi le, wherefore be it enacted, Ao. Becti n first releases all slaves in all of the States and Territories of the United States, and clothts them with toe,immunities of free citizens. Section second makes their re enslavement a crime punishable by fine and imprisoament Lovtiov is determined, if he possibly cau, to make the negro his political equal, or perhaps we had better said, make him self the equal of the negro. VV e have no serious objections to Mr. Lovejoy puting himself on an equality with the "free Americns of African doHcent," as that is simply a matter of taste which he has the right to exercise, but we strongly object to him using his official position to give the neorro all the rights and immunities of white men. But the idea of Lovejoy quot ing from the Constitution of the United States to sustain him in his infamous prop osition, is decidedly cool. He ought to blush for vory shame, to open tho lid of that sacred document, trampled upon and contemned as it haa been by himself and the leaders of his party, lie even has the sublime impudence to refor to that clause of it which declares "that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property with out duo process of law." How many huudreds of white men have bv the acts of tho present ad ministration been deprived of their liber' ty without "due process of law." Let tho damp, slimy walls of forts Lafayette, Warren. McHenry. and a hundred other government bastiles and prisons through out the country, answer ; and let the uu s A er Btrike deep into the guilty hearts of the despots who have committed these high crimes against the Constitution and the liberty of the citizen. With these crazy abolition fanatics the Constitution affords no protection to white men whom they may may choose to exercise their tyranny upon, but for the negro it is everything. Not satisfied with causing the sacrifice of half a million men for the suke of the negro, they must now guarantee to him that pro tection which, purchased by the blood of thoir revolutionary fathers, they deny and withhold from white men. Citizen are arrested by order of this administration and confined in filthy dungeons, without warrant or i charge preferred, held for weeks and months and then released with outtrial, or even as much as being in formed of the cause of their imprison ment, nothstanding the clear and explicit condemnation by the Constitution of such procedure. But according to Lovejoy's interpretation of the meaning of that in' strument, it has every protection for the sooty African, but affords none to the white man; who is so unfortunate as to fall under the displeasure of King Abraham or his tools and Jminions ; the blood that was poured out on the battle fields of the Revolution and the sacrifices that were made, according to Lovejoy and his ilk, were not for the benefit of the descendant of that proud race, but for the negro and his descendants forever, Under the high er law ideas of the Abolition destruction ists, the Constitution is a nullity, except when applicable to cases suited to their own peculiar and fanatical view. In our opinion, the day is not far distant when they will themselves seek its protection, and be glad to have it administered and constiued according to the intent and meaniug of its framers. of XiTNot the least Bad among tlie sug gestions in the President' message is the anology between olu Sumter and the Con' Btitutlon, as the one against which a foreign foe has thundered in vain, silently crumbles poicemeal before the President' cannon so the other which the fathers placed upon rock writing npon it, "let it be perpe tual' goes down before his proclamations.

It says that: "He goes at ths trade of Statesman wiihh's left hand, plays at blind man's buff with the King's Kngliah, and sets his Cabinet table in a roar with original jokes." XyThe telegraph has the imptrtant announcement thai the council of the l,oyai league, holding session in Washington, ha adjourned. Let the peo ple rejoice. Blessed are the Peacemakers. C. Chauncey Burr made a speech on the 1st nit., at the Bergen county, New Jersey, Dem' ocratic banquet, which is well worthy of re publication. It was made in response to the toast "Blessed ore the peace makers." A man might suppose that those who asked him to apeak to this sentiment had some de igns on his liberty, rielund this divine word, there sits a bastile. It was the Son of Mas who said blessed are the peacemakers, but Abraham Lincoln, and all the worshipers of blood and negroes, declare them accursed. To pray for peace was once a Christian virtue, It was the evidence ot a pure heart, andol an elevated intellect Is is treason now. The paths of peace, instead of leading a man's footsteps to heaven, lead to a dungeon. It you dare speak far peace there will come such a clamor ot profanity, Impudence and brutali ty about your ears as was nevor heard out of fandemonium. JSut still we dare speak for peace. Appealing to Uod tor the rectitude of our motives, and despising the base wretches who would impugn them, we sry aloud for peace. We cry for peace, as a man cries for water when his houso is ou fire. We are for peace, not alone because we know that war is rendering the restoration of the Union im possible, bnt also because it is destroying the organic life of our Government It is tearing out the keystone of the arch on which the whole edilice ot the American principle and American liberty rests. This is the irrepres sible reason why every patriot opposes the war. lo cover this black spot, and to draw away the public mind from the real issue, the Abo lition traitors cunningly cry out, "what.would you let the south go?" No, we would not, if we have the power to prevent it. What we propose to do is, to prevent you Irora driving them off entirely. It is precisely because we do not intend to abandou the Union, that we are for peace, just as yon are for war, because you have abandoned it. You boldly declare that the Union as it was, cannot and shall not be restored. Vice President Hamlin says it is demagoguism to talk of such a thing. There fore you are, not lighting to restore the Union. There is but one Union. That is the Union as it was formed bv the Constitution as it is. which you allirm shall never be restored, be cause it would perpetuate the labor institu tions of the south as they are secured by the Constitution. it is as impudent a lie for these Abolition traitors to call themselves friends of the Uniou. as it would have been for the French revolu tionists in 17H9 to call themselves friends of the throne of France. They were seeking to revolutionize the government ot France, as the Abolitionists are trying to revolutionise the Government of the Union. Robespierre said, ' Away with the throne thatgrants 1 tters patent of nobility." Lincoln nrd his party say, "Away with the Constitution that allows white men to hold negroes as taxable proper ty." This is the milk in the cocoanut. The cocoanut is a negro's head. That is what we are fighting lor. In relation to the war, there are three parties : r irst, the Abolition, or lie publican party, which says that the Union shall not be restored underline Constitution his; second, the party ot uundescripts, or War Democrats, who profess that they want the Union back just as it was, and vet support a war which they admit is waged for the purpose oi destroying tne constitution and Union ihn should be called the lunatic party. Must not men be crazy to support a war that they denounce as unconstitutionally carried on and meant to revolutionize the Government and destroy the Union? It is a charitable conclusion to suppose that such men are crazy. Is it for plunder and office that they connive at the baroarous murder ot hundreds of thou sands of our people, and at the everlasting destruction ot tne union that was formed by our lathers, and the overthrow of the laws of our Government of the United States ? Is it for plunder that they connive at these base and brutal designs? Then are they dogs, and not men ? But, we are told it is policy. What is policy? Is tl at the mild nam you give to the base cowardice that immolates your own 'aws and aids the Abolitionists in breaking to pieces the altars of liberty that were built by our fathers ? But the people are not yet ready for the truth. When will they be ready for the truth, if you continue to teach them a lie ? But the people are ready; they are always ready for the truth. It is the cowardice or ' treachery of the politicians that has confused and de moralized the ranks otthe people. The mean ing of this word policy is a lie; It is the last retuge or a coward or scoundrel, if toe word was not made in Hell, it ought to have been, for it is the devil's own trick lo cheat a man out of his virtue. It was not policy that won liberty for these States. It was principle. The policy monger said, wait I the time is not yet But the true man said, strike, the time to be free is dow and forever I Ou no lighterterms was liberty won. Un no lighter terms was liberty ever preserved. The true policy of the Democracy is to stand by ite own principles ot State sovereignty and State equality. These are the foundations of our Government Strike them down and the whole superstructure falls. When Federalism, or centralised despotism obtained control of the Government in 1798, under John Adams, it commenced a war upon the sovereignty or equality of the States, which threatened, as now, the destruction of the Constitution. Under the lead of Jefferson and Madison, the one the father of the Decla ration of Independence, and the other of the Constitution, the Democracy rallied around tb banner of State Hovereignty, defeated Ihe and buried federalism so deep it lay quietly in its grave for mors than sixty years. But now Federalism has com to the surface again, and is waging its old war upon Slate sovereignty with a furr and a malice that threatens to strike the sun of liberty out of th sky of Columbia. This is th paramount object of tb war. Opposition to secession is secondary matter with tha party waging tb war. They know that war is neither a con- stitutional aor a possible remedy for secession, and they bay tb fraukuess to declar that they will ever' co"-' "t th restoration of the Union under the Constitution as it la Tu .i..w,i. ,i;.; f. ,1,. overthrow of the Constitution, and for the de struction of the sovereignty of the States. It is a much a war against tha organie being ot the Northern as of the Southern States. It s a war upon State sovereignty, and thus lar in its progress it has been much more success ful in subverting the sovereignty oi lb Northern than of the Southern Suites. Be hold the pitiable condition of Governor Sey mour, of the once prond sovereign State of New lork, now humiliated, sitting disgraced and silent in the dust, surrounded by Federal bayonets, its citizens dragged beyond the ju- j riadiction and protection of ita courts by Fad oral officers, its courts superseded by, the President, its jails falling np with Federal: prisoners, tried by no jury and sentenced by no eourt of Justice, but by military commis sion at Washington. Do wa men of j New Jersey shudder at tha humiliation of our sis ter Slater Lt u shudder lor ourselves, lor we are no better off. We, too, are reduoed lo a military district, in which the Federal Gov ernment appoints creatures to Watoh os; who always occupied the social position ot ttieves in our midst; and patient people that ws are, one head has answered each of these satraps for a good many months now. The State of New Jersey has ceased to exist; it is Only a military district What made us State? Not the sky above us; not the slope and glades and fruitful fields with;n our borders Our Constitution and laws constituted ns a State, these have been suspended by the Fed eral Administration, and it can take one or all of yon whenever it pleases and send you to be the equal ot a negro, or to a dungeon. New Jersey is already just such a thing aathe Abolitionists threaten to make of each South ern State, a Federal colony, or military dis trict Mr. Lincoln has succeeded in doing to us what he has been unable to do to the peo ple of South Carolina, suspended the habtat eorpue and abolished trial by jury in such ca ses as he pleases. INow, tbe war has ben made the excuse for all this outrage and des potism. But we know this despotism is really the object of the war. Every Jerseyman in favor of this war is a foe to his own State, and to the very principle of government on whieli the Union ot the states was founded. Then. show us a Jerseyman who dare be anything bnt a Peace man; stand him up, and let us look at him. Mark biin well, for tbe time must come when be will be held to an awful responsibility for the part he has played in carrying on a war that is confessed to be for the destruction of the Union, and is known to be for the overthrow of the rights of the Stales. We are opposed to the war, because we are in favor of the Union as it was and the Con stitution as it is, and because we are for pre serving the sovereignty and honor of the State of New Jersey nay, of defending that sovereignty and honor against whatever power dares violate them. If any man say we are opposed to the war because we mean to aban don the Union, we hurl the falsehood back into the liar' teeth. We tell him that he knows his falsehood, and we charge him that he is for the war because he is against the Union and Constitution, and because he is an enemy to the sovereignty of his own State. He is a double traitor. lie is for allowing New Jersey to be reduced to the status of a colony of the Federal Government, and of tamely submitting to a despotism that puts the property and liberty of Jerseymen at the mcruy of a cabal of furious and bloedy imbe ciles in Washington. Let an inventory be taken of the demagogues or cowards who shrink from any conflict that may be necessa ry to defend the sovereignty of our State, and vindicate the manhood of our people. Acting within the limits of tbe Constitution, Mr. Lin coln cannot do too much to bring the revolted States back to Ibeir place within the Uniou. In such a work we ebould stand by him to the last hour. But may God Almighty never pardon our sins if we support him in the bloody business of driving and barring them out, and closing the night of despotism and African barbarism over their fruitful fieldsl Bad as secession is, it is not so great a crime against Government, against civilization and humanity, as Lincolnism. Secessionism claims to withdraw certain States from the ju risdiction of the Government ot the United States. There its crime ends. It makes no war upon our constitutional form of Govern meut, nor upon the theory of popular sover eignty ot which our country was born, But Lincolnism seeks to annihilate these States, to strike them out of existence, and totally repudiate the American principles of Govern ment Secessionism inflicts no wonnd apon the organic life of the remaining States. Lin colnism acknowledges its design to kill one third of the sovereign Slates of America, and its purpose to subvert the sovereignty oi the other two-thirds, is perfectly apparent Se cessionism is a runaway Lincolnism an as sassin. For the runaway there is yet hope there is a chanoe for repentance, for reforma tion, and for a return to the deserted family. But there is no remedy for Liuooloism or as sassination. - It is death, and there is nothing beyond but the desolation of the grave.
