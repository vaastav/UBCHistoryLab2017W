2 SENATE COMMITTEE DECIDES IN FAVOR OF CANAL TREATY Two of the flemfoers flake Objection to Certain Sec= tions, but Do Not Vote Adversely. WASHINGTON, Die. «5.-The Senate Committee on elgri Relations to-day "voted to report favorably the new Hay-Paunccfote treaty . pro viding for the construction df an isthmian canal. The committee was In session nearly two hours, and went over in detail the previsions of the convention. No votea were cast against It, but it was criticized very sharply by Senators Money and Ba con, who found In it many of the objec tions which they urged against the old COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE BATTLESHIP IOWA, WHO TOOK SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART IN MAIN TAINING FREE TRANSIT ACROSS THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA DURING THE RECENT REVOLUTION IN COLOMBIA, AND A SCENE ALONG THE PROPOSED ROUTE OF THE ISTHMIAN CANAL. treaty. They took especial exception to the provision continuing in force the neu trality provision of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and also made exception to the clause specially authorizing the United States to police the canal, as placing a limitation upon the power of this country to absolutely control it. The contention was made that the effect of the treaty »s sent to the Senate would be to deprive the 'United States of control of the canal in case of war. ** One of the Objections. Especial attention was called to the provision in the preamble of the pending treaty reserving article VIII of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty from the repeal provision of the new treaty. The por tion of this article of the old treaty to which objection was made reads as fol lows: In granting, however, their joint protection to any such canals or railways as are by this article gpecified it is always understood by- I ADVEETISEMENTS. — — |WhatDidIt| rft : * nc penccuon oi OjUS.ii ty in ; > S Is what struck the tasta, ap- . jj| tk preciatlon and approbation & S ol the American people. jg I;'.; ,":■; # a *It is now everywhere the first «j» 5 "sought and the first bought. 3; *#* *v* J# CHBISTT * WISE OOSOHSSIOW CO., Ine. «J d; SS3-S25CaJiro™iaSt. .San Francisco, C*L - 3! _• Teiephoiie iimln &7S. pi (* /patents; ij ,^£i^3SU MARKET ST. sT^SS^ ' the United States and Great Britain that the parties constructing or owning the same shall impose no ether charges or conditions of traffic thereupon than the aforesaid governments shall approve of as just" "and equitable; and that the same canals or railways, being open to the citizens and subjects . of the United States and Great Britain on equal terms, shall also be open on like terms to the citizens and subjects of every other state which Is willing to grant thereto such protection as the United States and Great Britain. engage to afford. Senators Money and Bacon did not go to the extent of voting against the re port of the treaty, and they acknowledge they are anxious to see It ratified because of their great desire to have the canal built. Still they Insisted that the treaty as it now stands Is very .objectionable in case of the contingency, of. war. Rapid Action Is Desired. Senator Frye presided over the meet ing, and he authorized Senator Lodge to report the treaty to the> Senate on Mon day next in case there should be an ex ecutive session on that day. It was also the sense of the committee that the con sideration of the treaty should be pressed as speedily as possible, in /the Senate, some Senators expressing the hope that action might be secured before the ad jourriment for the holidays. The com mittee also voted to recommend that the Injunction of secrecy be removed from the treaty. Senator Bacon moved the revival of the amendment to the original Hay-Paunce fote treaty, which' was suggested by Sen ator Davis, then chairman of the com mittee, and adopted by the Senate. The amendment provided, that nothing in the treaty "should apply to measures which the United States may find it nec essary to take for securing, by its own forces ihe defense of. the United States and the maintenance ■ of public order." The amendment was voted down viva voce. ■ ., Representative Hepburn of Iowa to-day introduced his isthmian canal bill, which Ly reason of his being the author of the bill passed last year and hia probable con tinuance at the head of the House Com merce Committee, is considered as the measure which will serve as a t-.sis lor action by the House. It differs from the Hepburn bill passed last year, in making the total appropriation 51SO.000.000 instead of $140,000,000. Of the -total amount $10, 000,000 la made immediately available to begin work. In . other respects the bill
