Aldrich Ha« In augurated Series Which 1B Meet Ing With Favor Among Teachers. SOME SCHOOL ACTIVITIES Miss Cora Mel Patten, Professional Reader of Chicago, Will En tertain the Public This Week. Supt.. William Aldrich of the Keo kuk public schools has inaugurated a series of demonstration lessons through the grades which are attract ing unusual attention among the teachers. The plan 1b one new in Keokuk and it is believed will in crease the efficiency of work In the grade department." The plan is to get the teachers of one grade together in one of the school buildings with the class of •that grade and the teacher regularly in charge of the class conducts- the lesson. Various exercises suitable to the grade are given by the teacher and the result can be discussed in general afterwards by the teachers of the particular grade. On last Thursday Miss Gage had a first term, first grade class at the Garfield school. Friday Miss Schuel er had a first term, second grade class at the Carey. Several classes of this character will be conducted this week. On Monday Miss Spears will have the first term, third grade class at the Garfield on Tuesday Miss Bindel will have a first term, sixth grade class at the same school and on Friday Miss Pearce will have a first term, seventh grade class at the Lincoln. Professional Reader This Week. Along the same line this week, Miss Cora Mel Patten of Chicago, a pro fessional reader, will be in Keokuk to do work in the high school and grades on down. Teachers will be present to see her work and .discuss her plans af terwards. On Tuesday at the high school in the afternoon at 4:30 o'clock, Miss Paten wants to meet representatives of various organizations interested In the drama and any others who have an interest in the work, to hear her talk on the Drama League of America. The talk will be complimentary. On Wednesday at 3 o'clock Miss Patten will entertain the high school and upper grade pupils with a presen tation of Blue Bird. On Thursday ev ening she will give "Evgry Woman," this being for the benefit of the pub lic. The Christmas Dinner. In spite of the fact that the word dyspepsia means '.iterally bad cook, it will not be fair for many to lay the blame on the cook if they begin the Christmas Dinner with little appe 'tite and end it with distress or nausea. It may not be fair for any to do that —let us hope so for the sake of the l!Ook! The disease dyspepsia Indicates ia bad stomach, that is a weak stom ach, rather than a bad cook, ana for I a weak stomach there is nothing else equal to Hood's Sarsaparllla, It gives the stomach vigor and tone, cures dys pepsia, creates appetite, and makes eating the pleasure it should be. .1 Hid Like a Groundhog.

LOUIS, Dec. 9.—The hypnotist's feat of burying a man below the ground, with only a pipe to give him air, was utilized by William Murphy this afternoon who thought the police were after hin for a three year old offense. Murphy got his mother to bury him two feet under ground and put a gas pipe in his mouth, so he could breathe. The police entered the house after another roan and were attracted to the pipe by Mrs. Murphy's strange action. fh, Cain the Jester". Cain had returned from the fields alone.

ON MERCHANT MARINE Explanation of Movement of Troops to Mexican Border During the Recent Overthrow of $ Diaz. WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. In the second one-topic message he has sent to congress during the four days of the present session President Taft re viewed the relations of the United States with foreign governments dur ing the past year. In this message the president gave the first official explanation of the post haste movement of 20,000 federal troops to Mexico nine months ago urged the United States senate to ratify the general arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France and the convention with Nicaragua and Honduras and suggested legislation that he declared would strengthen this nation's world trade and position among the other powers. On two subjects Included under "foreign relations" th3 president spoke only in brief fashion. He in formed congress of the conferences begun by American Ambassador Guild at St. Petersburg in regard to the question of passports in Russia for I American 

JQWS and explained that after the Christmas holidays he ex pected to send a special message on this subject. Although not brought out in his message, it was under stood that the brief mention of the arbitration treaties will be followed later by a message to the senate, be fore which they are pending, urging at longth their ratification. Jewish Passports Question. The president's reference to the passport question was added after the other parts of the message had been written. "By direction of the state depart ment," it read, "our ambassador to Russia has recently been having a series of conferences with the minis ter of foreign affairs of Russia with a view to securing a clearer under standing and construction of the treaty of 1832 between Russia and the United States, and the modification of any existing Russian regulations ^hlch may be found to interfere In any way with the full recognition of the rights of American citizens under the treaty. I believe that the' govern ment of Russia is addressing itself to the treaty and that sufficient progress has been made to warrant the hope that there may soon be removed any justification of the complaints of treaty violation now prevalent in this coun try. I expect that immediately after the Christmas recess I shall be able to make a further communication to congress on this subject." New Legislation Recommended. Aside from his review of the world's history for the past year, In which the United States particularly figured, the president recommended to congress the following legislation: The enactment of a law providing for the fulfillment of obligations as sumed by the United States in con nection with the settlement of the fur seal controversy the passage of a law to forbid the carriage of opium nntf other "habit-.forming drugs" in interstate commerce the formation of a central organization, in the nature of a national chamber of commerce, that would keep all such organizations in touch with commercial develop ments abroad, and the enactment into law of executive regulations provid ing for advancement in the diplomatic and consular service upon a merit basis instead of through political pre ferment. Suggestion also was made by the president that the present tariff act should be amended so that its max imum and minimum features, design ed to prevent undue discriminations against American commerce, could be graduated to meet varying degrees of discrimination such as have been en- ft* male weakness.

"It is increasingly clear," said the| president in this connection, "that to I obtain and maintain that equity nnd substantial equality of treatment es sential to the flourishing foreign trade, which becomes year by year more important to the industrial and com mercial welfare of the United States, we should have a flexibility of tariff sufficient for the give and take of ne gotiation by the department of state on behalf of our commerce and in dustry." Merchant Marine Urged. Outlining the idea of a central tnamoer of commerce," Mr. Taft' suggested that such an organization' might be managed by a committee composed of a small number of those now actively engaged in carrying on the work of some of the large asso ciations of this kind, with members ex officio from the state and commerce and labor departments. In leading up to this suggestion Mr. Taft showed that in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, the value of American ex ports increased $300,000,000 over the previous year, but indicated that furth er increase was possible. Regarding the need of a merchant marine, the president says: "I need hardly reiterate the convic tion that there should speedily be built up an American merchant ma rine. This is necessary to assure fa vorable transportation facilities to our great ocean-borne commerce as well as to supplement the navy with adequate reserve of ships and men. It would have the economic advantage of keeping at home part of the vast sums now paid (foreign shipping for carrying American goods. All the great commercial nations pay heavy subsidies to their merchant marine, so that it is obvious that without some wise aid from the congress the United States must lag behind in the matter of merchant marine in its present anomalous position." Mexican Border Troop* Movement. The president's explanation cf the sudden dispatch of one-quarter of the army to the Mexican border agreed with the unofficial reason for that troop movement given last spring, but he showed In a confidential letter to Gen. Leonard Wood, chief of staff of the army, that there waB no doubt in his mind as to what he would do if he had found American lives and prop erty in danger. "It seems my duty as commander In chief," said the president In this let ter ir.ade public for the first time in the message, "to place troops In sufficient number, where if congress shall direct that they enter Mexico to save American lives and property, an effective movement may be promptly made." The outcome ot the troop move-i Lot 1 Consists of Ladies Cloaks the latest style in all new colors, worth $10, 12 and $15, for this sale $6.98 .vr-' Consists of 100 Ladies Wool Serge Dresses in about 25 different styles and colors, not one of these dresses worth less than $10 up to $15, this sale $4.98

The recent attempt to: undermine the Madero government in Mexico so far as it was engineered I in the United States, he said, had been met with the same policy the govern-j ment pursued in regard to the revol-| utionists who overthrew the govern-! ment of President Diaz—the "so-call-l ed neutrality statutes" were enforced against all. In regard to China, now jn the throes of revolution, Mr. Taft had lit tle to say except to explain the loans placed in that country by American and other foreign capitalists. In the present war between Italy ?nd Turkey, tho president pointed out the United States "has no direct political inter-} est." .....
