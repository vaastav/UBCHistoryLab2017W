JL GRADE IS HIGH IN OKLAHOMA Cotton Mao Takes Optimistic View of Situation Grady County Crops Diversified Enough is Opinion SOUTH IS SECTION FOR DIVERSIFICATION 1527 Bales Ginned in Chickasha this Season Market is Weak Now Staple Crop is Neglected "PLEASE SEND US SOME NEW TOYS" " t' .-X: : Manager L. C. Hutaon of the India howa Gins takes an optimistic view of the cotton situation and especially on the question of this section diversify ing crops and turning from the pro duction of cotton. "We have ginned about 85,000 bales at our plants in the blate of which Chickasha has supplied 1T.27 tales up to last Saturday. Okla homa cotton is grading higher this year than In many years previous, the long staple quality. Of course at this seat-on of the year, when growers are selling only In sufficient lots to meet the demand for Xmas monev, or com ing due accounts, the market is weak and sluggish. We diversify crops in Grady county quite enough. On a fair estimate I do not think the farms of the county average 20 acres in cot ton. In the extreme southern states one will find the entire available acre age In cotton. That i3 the section in which to urge diversification. Cotton with us here In Grady county could well be increased in acreage and tho fanner profit by the increased output. Near, Amber" the soil is well adapted to cotton growing, yet that staple is visibly neglected and cereal crops put In that disappoint in quality and Quantity of growth. That the present cotton cry is a price depressing ava lanche of overproduction Is yet to be proven. The larger eastern cities started the appeals "Help the south:" "Huy a bale of cotton" until the im pression prevails in that section that the south is slowly smothering under millions of pennds of non-saleable cot ton. Tins is not true. Head the fol lowing from the Cotton and Cotton Oil News: "If in such a land as this, where tho farmers for the five years preceding the present crop received an average of largely over 12 cents a pound for their cotton, yielding very large profits, one year's complete failure of the cotton crop, or one year's inabil ity, as at present, to sell the cotton crop, brings about such a condition as to flood the land with plasters begging for charity to "help the south," then it is time for the people of this sec tion who have backbone and stamina to take the lead and try to stem the Just 14 More Shopping Days! ed to satisfy themselves as to the character of the cargo before a ship sails, but it is understood that they will be instructed to accept the assur ances of reputable exporters as to the character of the cargo. The state department is not to fig ure in these arrangements which are to be made between American ship pers as individuals and the foreign consular officers. Mr. Bryan said he was satisfied that this method would afford a means of moving the Ameri can cotton freely. Ho explained that already it was being put itto practice and a large steamer would be loaded w ith cotton at Charleston, S. C, short ly and be dispatched to a continental European port with every prospect of making a speedy and uninterrupted voyage. "It was learned Monday that the British government finally has secur ed the adoption of the neutral govern ments of Europe either of embargoes or that takings of cargoes of copper shall not be permitted to pass her bor ders In transit to belligerent states. In this connection it was stated that no further difficulty would be suffered to American shipments of copper to Europe." Regarding the embargo on wool ex ports it is believed that this operates only to prevent the exportation of Australian and other British colonial wools to points outside of England or her colonies. It does not apply to Ar gentine wools or wools coining from any other country into England and bought for re-exportation to America. current. v "In the ten-year period between i coo and 130 1, wnen coiiou um oi til 1

Washington, Dec. $. I'reclrlent WU son today delivered his annual address to congress. Problems brought out by the great conflict in Europe engaged the greater part of his attention. The message follows: Gentlemen of tho Congress: Tho session upon which you are now entering will be the closing session of the Sixty-thlxd consress, a eougress, I venture to sty, which will long be re membered for tho great body of thoughtful and constructive work which it has done, in loyal response to the thought und needs of the coun try. I should like in this address to re view the notable record aid try to make adequate assessment of it; but no doubt we stand too near the work that has been done and are ourselves too much part of it to play the part of historians toward it. Moreover, our thoughts are now more of the future than of the past. 1 While we have worked at our tasks of peace the circumstances of the whole age have been altered by war. What we have done for our own land and our own people we did with the best that was in us, whether of char acter or of intelligence, with sober enthusiasm and a confidence in the principles upon which we were acting which sustained us at every step of the difficult undertaking; but it is done. It has passed from our hands. It is now au established part of the legislation of the country. Its useful ness, its effects,, will disclose them selves in experience. What chiefly strikes us now, as we look about us during these closing days of a year which will te forever iuemorable in the history of the world, is that we face new tasks, have been facing them these six months, must face them in the months to come face them with out partisan feeling, likt; men who have forgotten everything but a com mon duty and the fact that we are representatives of a great people whose thought is not of us but of what America owes to herself und to all mankind in such circumstances as these upon which we look amazed and anxious. Europe Will Need Our Help. War has interrupted the means of trade not only but also the processes of production. In Europe it is destroy ing men and resources wholesale and upon a scale unprecedented and ap palling. There is reason to fear that the time is near, if it be not already at hand, when several of the 'coun tries of Europe will find it difficult to do for theirpeople "what they have hitherto been always easily able to do, many essential and fundamental things. At any -ate they will need our help and our manifold services as they have never needed them before;, and we should be ready, more fit and ready than we have ever bcrn. It 4s of equal consequence that the nations whom Europe has usually sup plied with Innumerable articles of manufacture and commerce of which they are in constant need and without which their economic development i halts and stands still can now get only a small part of what they formerly im ported and eagerly look to us to supply their all but empty markets. This is particularly true of our own neighbors, the states, great and small, of Central and South America. Their lines of trade have hitherto run chiefly athinirt the seas, not to our ports, but to the ports of Great Britain and of the older continent of Europe. I do not stop to Inquire why, or to make any comment on probable causes. What luterests us just now is not the explanation, but tho fact, and our duty and opportunity in the presence of it. Here are mar kets which we must supply, and we must find the means of action. The United States, this great peonte for whom we speak and act, should be ready, as never before, to serve itself and to serve mankind; ready with its resources, its energies, its forces of production, and its means of distribu tion. We Need Ships. It is a very practical matter, a mat ter of ways and means. We have the resources, but are we fully ready to use them? And if we can make ready what we have, have we the means at hand to distribute it? We are not fully ready; neither have we the means of distribution. We are willing, but we are not fully able. We have the wish to serve and to serve greatly, gener ously; but wo are not prepared as we should be. We are not ready to mo bilize our resources at once. We are not prepared to use them immediately and at their best, without delay and without waste. To speak plainly we have grossly erred in the way in which we have stunted and hindered the development of our merchant marine. And now, when we need ships, we have not got them. We have year after year de bated, without end or conclusion, the best policy to pursue with regard to the use of the ores and forests and water powers of our national domain In the rich states of the West, when we should have acted; and they are ctlll locked up. The key is still turned upon them, the door shut fast at which thousands of vigorous men, full of initiative, knock clamorously for admittance. The water power of our navigable streams outside the na tional domain, also, even in the east ern states, where we have worked and plar.ned for generations, is still not used as it might be, because we will (Continued on Page Two.)

That the Ger mans were able to make such a vigor ous attack for eight days up to last Saturday Is due to the fact that they were reinforced by the arrival of more than 240,000 Infantrymen and five cav alry divisions. It was admitted offic ially that a part of the new troops were from the western battle area. The Germans lost heavily, as did also the Russians. The internal staff of the hospital consists of Drs. W.
