ELKTON, DECEMBER 11, 1860.' The President’s Message. The President's Message was read from the manuscript iu both Houses of Congress on Monday last, the first day of the session. The document is much shorter than any previous annual message of the President, touching briefly hut pointedly every point of interest which claims the President s at tention within the hounds of this vast country, as well as our intercourse with foreign nations. Though brief, compara tively as it is, wo have not space to give the message entire, and present those parts which are of most vital interest with a sum mary of the less important details. The message opens as follows: To the Senate and House of Jlepresentalieei : In coming before you for the first time as Chief Magistrate ot 'this great nation, it is with gratitude to the Giver of all good for the many benefits we enjoy. We are bless ed witli peace at home, and we are without entangling alliances abroad to forhode trouble; with a territory unsurpassed in fertility, of an area equal to the abundant support of five hundred millions of people, and abounding in every variety of useful mineral in quantity sufficient to supply the world for generations with abundant crops. After enumerating the vast resorces of tho nation and glancing at its future pros pective power and resorces, and reminding Congress of the weighty responsibilities resting on them and him, the message con tinues; Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic magnitude, aided as it was by the sympa thies aud assistance of nations with which wo were at peace, eleven States of the Union were, four years ago, left without a legal State Government. American Commerce was also almost driven from the seas, the industry of almost one-half of the country taken from tho hands of the capitalists and placed in those of the laborer. The work of restoring State Governments loyal to the Union has not met with the success in all particulars that was desired, hut has yet been more satisfactory than could have been reasonably anticipated. Seven States which passed ordinances of secession have been fully restored to their places in the Union. The eighth (Georgia) Yield an election, at which she ratified her constitution, republican in form, elected a Governor, members of Congress, a State Legislature, and all other officers required. The Governor was duly installed, and the Legislature met and performed all the acts required of them by the reconstruction acts of Congress. Subsequently, however, in violation of the constitution they had just ratified, as siuce decided by tho Supreme Court of the State, "they unseated the colored members of the Legislature, and admitted to seats some members who are disqualified hy the third clause of tho four teenth amendment to tho Constitution, one article which they themselves had contri buted to ratify.” Under these circum stances, I would submit to yon whether it would not he wise, without delay, to enact a law authorizing the Governor of Georgia to convene the members originally elected to the Legislature, requiring each member to take the oath prescribed hy tho recon struction acts, and none to ho admitted who are ineligible under the third clause of the fourteenth amendment. The means provided for paying tho pub lic debt are deemed more than ample. The admission of the Senators and Rep resentatives of tho State of Virginia and the restoration of the State to her place in tho Union is recommended. Among the evils growing out cf the re bellion, and not yet referred to, is that of an irredeemable currency. It is an evil which I hope will receive your most earnest attention. It is a duty, and ono of the highest duties of Government, to secure to the citizens a medium of exchange of fixed and unvarying value. This implies a re turn to a specie basis, and no substitute for it can be devised. It should be com menced now, and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interests of the debtor class. Immediate resumption, if practicable, would not he desirable. It would compel the debtor class to pay beyond their con tracts the premium on gold at the date of purchase, and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousands. I see but one way, and that is to authorize the Treasury to redeem its own paper at a fixed price whenever presented, and to withhold from circulation all currency so redeemed until sold again for gold. The entire public debt could he paid in ten years, but it is not desirable that the people should be forced to pay it in that time. Year by year the ability to pay increases in a rapid rate, but the bur den of interest ought to lie reduced as rap idly as can be done without a violation of contract. The message recommends that that part of the public debt represented hy 5-20 Bonds he refunded, at a lower rate of in terest not exceeding 4] per cent. The revenues of the country are greater than the requirements, and it is recom mended that a reduction he made. The report of the Secretary of the Trea sury shows the receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30 1809, to be $370,943,747. and the expenditures in cluding interest, bounties. &c., to be $321, 490,597. Tho estimates for the ensuing year are more favorable to the Government, and will, ao doubt, show a much larger de crease of the public debt. Tho receipts in the Treasury beyond expenditures have ex ceeded the amount necessary to place to the credit of tiie sinking fund, as provided by law. To lock up the surplus in the Treasury and withhold it from circulation would lead to such a contraction of the cur rency as to cripple trade and seriously af fect the prosperity of the country. Under these'eircumstanees the Secretary of the Treasury and myself heartily concurred in the propriety of using all tho surplus cur rency in the Treasury in the purchase of Government bonds, thus reducing the in terest-hearing indebtedness of the country, and of submitting to Congress tho question of the disposition to he made cf tiie bonds so purchased. The bonds now held by the Treasury amount to about $75,000,000, including those belonging te the Sinking Fund. I recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the Sinking Fund. The office of Commissioner of I sternal Revenue is one of tiie most arduous and re sponsible under the Government. It falls hut little; if any, short of a Cabinet posi tion in its importance and responsibilities. I would ask for it, therefore, such legisla tion as in your .judgement will place the office upon a footing of dignity commen surate with its importance and with the character and qualifications of the class of men required to till it properly. The President acknowledges the warm sympathy felt hy the people and Govern ment of tho United States for tne strug gling patriots of Cuba; hut tho contest has never assumed a condition which amounts to a war in the sense of international law, or which would show the existence of a de facto political organization of the insur gents sufficient to justify a recognition of belligerency. The principle is maintained, however, that this nation is its own judge when to accord the rights of belligerency, either to a people struggling to free them selves from a government they believe to bo oppressive, or to independent nations at war with each other. The United States have no disposition to interfere witli the existing relations of Spain to her colonial possessions on this continent. They be lieve that in due time Spain and the Euro pean powers will find their interest in ter minating these relations, and establishing their present dependencies as independent powers, members of the family of nations. The subject of an inter-oceanic canal, to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, through the Isthmus of Darien, is one in which commerce is greatly interested.— Instructions have been given to onr minis terto the Republic of the United States of Columbia to endeavor to obtain authority for a survey hy this Government in order to determine tiie practicability of such an undertaking, and a charter for the right of way to build, by private enterprise, such a work, if the survey proves it to he prac ticable. Towards the close of the last Ad ministration a convention was signed at London for the settlement of all outstand ing claims between Great Britain and tho United States, which failed to receive tho advice and consent of the Senate to its rat ification. The time and the circumstances j attending the negotiations of that treaty were unfavorable to its acceptance hy the people of the United States, and its pro visions wore wholy inadequate for the set tlement of the grave wrongs that had been sustained hy this Government, ns well as hy its citizens. The injuries resulting to the United States hy reason of the course ; adopted by Great Britain during our late ! civil war, in tho increased rate of insurance, in tho diminution of exports and imports, j and other obstructions to domestic Indus- | try and production; in its effect upon the foreign commerce of tho country; in the decrease and transfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine; in the prolonga tion of the war. and in the increased cost, both in treasure and in lives, if its suppres sion could not he adjusted and satisfied as ordinary commercial claims which continu ally arise between commercial nations; and yet the convention treated these simply as such ordinary claims, from which they dif fer more widely in tho gravity of their character than in the magnitude of their amount. Great even as is that difference, not a word was found in the treaty, and not an inference could he drawn from it, to remove the sense of tho unfriendliness of the course of Great Britan in onr strug gle for existence, which had so deeply and universally impressed itself upon the people of this country. Believing that a conven tion thus misconceived in its scope and in adequate in its provisions would not have produced tho hearty, cordial settlement of pending questions which alone is consis tent with tho relations which I desire to have established between the United States and Great Britain, I regarded the action of tho Senate in rejecting tho treaty to have been wisely taken, in the interest of peace, ami as a necessary step in tho direction of a perfect and cordial friendship between tho two countries. A sensitive people, con scious of their power, are more at ease under a great wrong wholly unatoned than under the restraint of .settlement which satisfies neither their ideas of justice nor their graves sense of tho grievance they have sustained. The rejection of tho trea ty was followed by a state of public feeling on both sides which I thought not favora ble to an immediate attempt at renewed negotiations. I accordingly so instructed the minister of tho United States to Great Britain, and found that views in this regard were shared hy her Majesty’s minister. 1 hope that the time may soon arrive when the two governments can approaoh the solution of this momentous question with an appreciation of what is duo to the rights, dignity, and honor of each, and with tho determination not only to remove the caus es of complaint in tho past, hut to lay the foundation of a broad principle of public law which will prevent future difficulties and tend to a firm and continued peace and friendship. This is now the only grave question which tho United States have with any foreign nation. A rnewal of the Reciprocity Treaty be tween the United States and Canada, is opposed on the ground that Canada is alone benefited hy such a treaty. It having come to my knowledge that a corporate company organized under the British law proposed to land upon the shores of the United States and to operate there a submarine cable under a concession from his Majesty the Emperor of the French, of an exclusive right, for twenty years of communication between the shores of Franco and the United States, with the very objectionable feature of subjecting all messages conveyed thereby to the scru tiny autl control of the French government, I caused the French ami British legations at Washington to be made acquainted with the probable policy of Congress on the subject, as foreshadowed by tho bill which passed the Senate in March last.— This drew from tho representatives of the company an agreement to accept as the basis of their operations the provisions of that hill, or of such other enactment on the subject as might he passed during the approaching session of Congress; also, to use their influence to secure from tho French government a modification of their conces sion so as to permit the landing upon French soil of any cable belonging to any company incorporated hy the authorities of the United States, or of any State in the Union, and on their part not to oppose the establishment of any such cable. In con sideration of this agreement, I directed the withdrawal of all opposition by the United States authorities to tho landing of the cable and to the working of it until the meeting of Congress. I regret to say that there has been no modification made in the company’s concession, nor, so far as I can learn, have they attempted to secure one.— Their concession excludes the capital and the citizens of the United States from com petition upon the shores of France. I rec oin mended legislation to protect the rights of citizens of the United States, as well as the dignity and sovereignty of the nation against such an assumption. Onr manufactures are increasing with wonderful rapidity under the encourage mont which they now receive. With the improvement in machinery already effected and still increasing, causing machinery to take the place of skilled labor to a largo extent, our imports of many articles must fall off largely within a very few years. Gu my assuming the responsible duties of Chief Magistrate of the United States, it was with the conviction that three things were essential to its peace, perpetuity, and fullest developments. First among these is strict integrity in fulfilling all our obligations. Second. To secure protection to the per son and property of tho citizen of the United States in each and every portion of our common country, wherever he may choose to move, without reference to origi nal nationality, religion, color, or politics, demanding of him only obedience to the laws and proper respect for the rights of others. Third. Union of all tho States, with equal rights, indestructible hy any consti tutional means. The repeal of the Tenure of Office Law is asked hy the President. The management of the Indian tribes hy agents selected hy the Society of Friends has proven thus far most satisfactory. Tho report of tho Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the War Depart ment for the year ending the 30th of June, liSO;', to he *80,014,042, of which $23,882,310 was disbursed in the payment of debts con tracted during the war, and is not charge able to current army expenses. Ilis esti mate of $:M,i)31,031 for the expenses of tho army for the next fiscal year is as low as it is believed can ho relied on. The report of tho Secretary of the Inte rior shows that the quantity of the public lands disposed of during the year ending 30th of June, 18G0, was 7,006,000, exceed ing that of the preceding year hy 1.010,409 acres. Of this amount 2,8!)!),544 acres were sold for cash, and 2,737,305 acres entered under the he ncstcad law. During the year ending the 30th of Sep tember, 1809, the Patent Office issued 13,- 702 patents, and its receipts were $680,389 —being $213,920 more than the exjiendi tures. The report of the Postmaster General furnishes a clear and comprehensive exhibit of the operations of the Postal service aud of the financial condition of the Postoflicfc Department. The ordinary postal revenues for the year ending June 30th, 1809, amoun ted to $18,344,510, and tho expenditures $23,098,131 ; showing an excess of expen ditures over receipts of $5,353,520. The excess of expenditures over receipts for the previous year amounted to $0,437,992. — The increase of revenues for 1809 over those of 1808 was $3,051,909, and tho in crease of expenditures was $937,539. The increased revenue in 1809 exceeded tho in creased revenue of 1808 hy 900,306, and the increased expenditure in 1809 was $2,52t,5i0 less than tho increased expendi ture in 1808, showing by comparison this gratifying feature of improvement, that while the increase of receipts in 1808 was $2,438,535, tho increase of expenditures over tho increase cf receipts in 1809 was $1,084,371. Your attention is respectfully called to the recommendations made hy the Post master General for authority to change the rate of compensation to tho main trunk railroad lines for tho r services in carrying the mails ; for having post route maps exe cuted ; for reorganizing and increasing the efficiency of tlie special agency service ; for increase of the mail service in the Pacific and for establishing mails under the (lag of the Union on tho Atlantic, and most espe cially do we call for your attention to his recommendation for the total abolition of the franking privilege. This is an abuse from which no ono receives a commensur ate advantage. It reduces the receipts for postal set vice from 25 to 30 per cent., and largely increases the service to lie perform ed. The method by which postage should tie paid upon public matters is sot forth fully iu the report of the Postmaster Gen eral. An increase of tho salary of the Justices ol the Supreme Court is recommended. Texas.— The first reports of the elec tion in Texas which reached us wore un favorable to the Republican tickat, but when the returns were received the aspect of affairs were changed. Tho Republicans have not only defeated Jack Hamilton hut have elected two out of three members of Congress, and perhaps all of them, and car ried the Legislature hy a larger majority. *9 —The committee of the Virginia Legis lature now in Washington have had an in terview with General Butler, Chairman of of the Committee on Reconstruction, and arc satisfied that the Congressmen from that State will be admitted. OUR 

NEIGHBORS. DELAWARE. Alderman Vincent, of Wilmington, is about publish ing a history of Delaware. A fair and festival, on a grand scale, for the benefit of the Masonic Lodge, of Middletown, will commence on the Wednesday before the Holidays, and continue until New Year’s Day. A gentleman from the vicinity of Middletown, was pro-sing along one of tha streets of Philadelphia, a few days since, and seeing a pile of I'euch Baskets stopped and counted them, fifty in number, and recognized the mark on them. This may suggested what has become of so many of the baskets of our peach growers. The postofhee at Felton was broken into hist week, and several watches stolen. The deputy postmaster is a watchmaker. It is not generally known that cotton is successfully cultivated on this peninsula, but such is the fact. Beau tiful cotton is regularly raised in Accomac and North ampton counties, Va., and shipped either to Norfolk or Crisfleld. Thu two colored men, Joshua Jonns and Lewis Car penter. convicted of rape, at the New Ca.tle County Court, last week, hare been sentenced to bo hung, on the 4th of February, next. Arrangements are in progress to have a course of lec tures delivered in the Middletown Hall, the present win ter, during which Henry Ward Beecher, Brick Pomeroy, Horace (Jreeley, and other iiotablss will appear. Robert A. Cochran is hauling bricks into Middletown, preparatory to building a tine brick store house, on the corner of Broad and Main streets. It is possible that he may extend his improvements so far ns to erect an entire brick front from the corner to Walker’s hotel. On Thursday night of last week, the Citizens National Bank of Middletown was entered by burglars, and rob bed of u number of Ikxklh, amounting in value to nearly $20,000. The Bank is situated in a room in the new Town Hall, and the thieves effected an entrance hy prying open u back window. In the Bank were two firee-proof safes, in one of which was the money belonging to the Bank, i and in the other books, papers, Ac., and a number of I bonds left there for sale keeping its special deposits.— This safe the robbers pried open and stole therefrom bonds ns follows; —One
