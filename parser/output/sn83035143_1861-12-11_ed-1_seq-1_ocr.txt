Secretary Chase grasps the detail as Trail as the generalities of his Department, and pre sents a paper lruieb. ire guarantee has had no superior for practical sens.. The figures he gives are enormous, but ire have' an enormous country to make the figures good. The Report tells its own story in plain language, and we refer to to it for ail par ticular. Another of Floyd's Tricksâ€”Seventy Thousand Stand of Arms sent to California. Some weeks since we published a dis patch to the effeot that the UoTernment ex pected to receive 35,000 stand of arms from California, and were at a lrss to con eeire how so many oould be spared from or hare gone to the Faci&o coast. It seems that the Californians were equally aston ished on discovering how rich they were, a will be seen by the following from the Loa Angeloa Star: Seventy thousand stand of arms were ent here by Fiord, and so secretly convey ed to tha Benicia arsenal, that no one not specially entrusted with the information, knew of their arrival, Even after the arms had been stored in the arsenal for months, tha Legislature made a requisition upon the General Government for materials of war, which requisition was actually , complied with, and the arms solicited were promptly furnished. This shows that the Ad ministration itself was not aware of the bountiful manner in which Floyd had sup plied the 8tate with muskets and rifle. The arms were sent here, without a doubt, in expectation of their being seized by se cessionists. Had the plan sucoeeded Cali fornia would have been in a state of revo lution to-day. In the programme of the ' rebellion arranged at Richmond, the at- tempt was to be made either to unite Cal ifornia with the Sooth or form distinot Confederacy of tha PaoiS States. A can vass of the popular feeling demonstrated i the impossibility of effecting either of these ehemes of treason, or even seizing and retaining the arms for the use of the Bouth. Discovered by the Department, 85,000 of them were returned to tha Atlantio Stales, and the remainder conveyed to Aleatrax, where loch of Uem as are not in use are j safely stored, The question may well be asked, "In a time.of profound peace, what excuse was there for sending 70,000 extra stands of arms to California?'' Floyd only can answer; we can only conjecture. The expedients of soldiers to obtain liquor seem Inexhaustible. A Paducah correspondent of the St. Loui Republican ays the other day a man s'arted out with his coffee-pot for milk ; on his return, an officer suspecting him of having whisky in his can, wished to examine it, and the man satisfied him by pouring out milk. 'At night there was a general drunk in that oldier'a quarters, ending in a fight. It wa at last disoovered that the man had put little milk into the spout of hi can, seal ing the inside with bread, and filling the can with whisky. That man is "cute" enough to lead an expedition against Jeff. Thompson. It is said by a writer on board tha San Jacinto, that Commander Wilkes ran near enough to Charleston to afford his pilgrims an opportunity of once more beholding the tower high and battlement gray of that acred city their starting place not fifteen day before and also, that the San Jacin to anohoTed almost within gun-shot of the rebel batteries, at which the rebel minis ters were permitted to gaze and contenv plate, with whit satisfaction they can their present situation.

Martello Towers. of The Philadelphia Ledger, ot November 19th. in an article on "The Delaware River," referring to the opinion of " a dis tinguished military officer," said : b He especially advocated the strength ening of the fortification by the construc tion of Alartello Towers. In reference to this defense a word of explanation may be necessary. At Mortella, in Corsica, a strong tower made a most determined re sistance to a superior force of English at tacking it in 171)4. Struck with the em- oacy of the conBtruotion, the British Gov ernment ordered twenty-seven or tnese towers to be built on the channel coast to provide against a French descent. By corruption from Mortella, these towers were called Alartello, a name applied to a strong but small tower, with walls of great thickness, thoroughly cannon proof, hav ing its door some distance from the ground, and a ladder which oan be drawn in. Eoh tower mounts one traversing gun, in working which the men are defended by lofty parapet The tower is manned by from six to twelve men."

Hen a, of New York, replied, savin? if the objeot of the caucus was to provide a war policy, it was very improper. The way to end the war was by fighting, not by re solutions of Congress. He closed by offer ing two resolutions endorsing the Phila delphia and Chicago platforms ; that this meeting recognises no right of a Congres sional 'Convention to add or take away from tb ese statements of principles; that we are rejoiced that all political parties are giving loyal sunn. rt to the war, and noth ing ihotild be done by Republicans to create dissension, or revive party distinctions, in its prose ouuon. - Many speeches were made, but the vol was postponed to Wednesday night.

NEW YORK, Dec. 10. a The following is an abridged copy of the report of CapL Wilkes, assigning his reason for the arrest ot Mason and anueu : C, S.

The Question arose in my mind whether I had the right to capture the persons of the Commissioners, and whether they were amenable to capture. There was no doubt that I had the right to capture vessels with written dispatches. They are expressly referred to in all authorities, subjecting the vessel to seixure and condemnation the captain of the vessel had the knowl edee of their being on board. . i But these gentlemen were not aispatcnes in the literal sense, and no where could find a case in point. They bad been present - I ed the Captain General ot Cuba by H. B. M.

I - There can be no doubt be knew they' were Oftrryiug highly lmyortant dispatches, and were endowed with instructions inimical to the United States. This rendered his vessel, though neutral, a good prize. I determined to take possession of the vessel, and as I mentioned in my report, send . her to Key West for adjudication. ' I forbore to seize her, however, in oon sequence of my being so reduoed in officers and crew, and the derangement it would cause innocent persons, there being large number of passenger who would have beon put to great loss and inconvenience, as well as disappointment, from the inter ruption it would have caused them in not being able to join the steamer from St. Thoma for Europe, I therefore concluded to sacrifice the in terests of my officers and crew in the prise and suffer the steamer to proceed after the necessary detention to effect tha transfer of these commissioners, considering I had eb tained the important end I had in view.
