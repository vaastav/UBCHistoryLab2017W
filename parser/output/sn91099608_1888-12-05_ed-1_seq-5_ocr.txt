ANNUAL PAPER IS CmcAdO, Dec. 4.—Tho Herald wiys: "Thcro is not imSHftRO in tlirn Jinport nut and Hignll!c.!iiit Piatt? paper but Im prcf.s«s the country with stmiae that. Urnvor Clovolaml, ns presliieDt, ia the n^ht man 111 the right place." The Times (l)em.) say.s: "Many mil lions of citizens readiUR this lust state paper of Cleveland's will (ind themselves deeply regretting the failure to re-elect him to the presidency." The Nowfl (Tnd. Hop.) says: "None but a hide bound pnrlUaa cau fail to be aroused to admiration of the man who, in the hour of political defeat, can still keep Ills rudder true and absolutely sup press ull personal feeling 111 his last oil! cfal ut terance. If a Democrat, he must be proud ot the rneRisd statesmanship and earnest striving for the best interest of the country which marks Its every line." The Tribune says: "Tho message con tains neither thought nor suggestion, except on the tariff question, where tho president lias in the past year made a prodigious stride from tariff reform to naked, absolute free trade. The presi dent is bold, nervy, and desires at least one more round before he will acknowl edge himself whipped." The Inter Ocean says: "The message contrasts sharply with tho policy adopted a year ago when the president could think of nothing but the tariff. That part of his message might liave been written by Manton Marble, Joseph Medill, Henry Wattersou or any other iree trader, accustomed to think, pen in hand. In iacfc tho New York World, Louisville Courier-Journal and Chicago Tribune have said substantially the same thing as one finds in this message, over and over iipuln, and they were Stdle be fore they said them the llrst time." 

UAI.TIMOISH, Dec. 4.—Tho Sun says: "Mr. Cleveland writes with the authority and power of a man whose convictions are thorough and whose information is fall, and with that nlr of confidence which springs from the consciousness that the truth, like other great forces, continues to move on and grow, notwithstanding the efforts of party politicians to de stroy. Altogether, the message Is ex ceedingly full and well written. It is a fitting supplement to the able state pa pers President Cleveland has given the country, and of no public servant in this generation at least, can it be more truly s&id than of himself, that he has con stantly guarded the rectitude of his Inten tions, maintained unsullied his love of country and with unselfish purpose striv en for the public good." lNi)iAAi'OLlS, Ind., I)ee. 4.—The Journal says: "The solemn and ponder ous way in which the prosident begins by referring to the dangers that threaten the government at the beginning of its E*cond hundred years of national exist ence, and then lapses in to chronic plati tudes about the tariff and surplus, seems like a great reach after'sometuing states manlike. It only attains to mischievous, demngogery, lor that Is the size ot his talk about the growth of classes, the gulf between employers and employes, the exactions of capital, the wrongs of labor, etc. In all this jeremiad about the decadence of patriotism, of morals, there is not a sound principle nor healthy Idea. No president lias over before so roundly luctured the American people for their own alleged neglect" of duty, nor so plainly appealed to class Interests and prejudices in support of a set pol icy."

They know that what bet ters tlio wageworkers' condition enliancos the price of their products, and tliey voted nccox-dingly." Mr. Breckcnridgeot Kentucky (Dem.): "The president keeps in view the fact that there Is a fight. between Monopoly and labor,'and he is on the side of labor." Mr. JtfcMillin ol Tenuessoo (Deuii.) "The president maintains the advanced position he assumed on the tariff, and he is right." Mr. Weaver of- Iowa, (Ind.): "The president's position on tho tariff is just the right thiug, but I am Sorry ho saw tit to recommend a {suspension of silvei coinage." Mr. Crispof Georgia (Dem.): "I,think the president gives a. strong and correct presentation of the Democratic vie# of the tariff question." Mr. Blouttjit of Georgia (Dem.): "it is the ablest paper he has ever produced. Mr. Thomas of Illinois (Hep.): "Tho slgle Is decidedly sophomoric. No dis tinction is made between external and Internal taxes. They' are spoken of as common burden. Taking the message as a whole, one is reminded of that beatific state of philosophy and purity In which a disappointed office seeker finds himself when he contemplates the follies and frailties of mankind. It !s real!y a pitiful wail." Mr. Duuhatn of Illinois, (Rep.) "It is a rehash of the tariff message that killed him. We look Upon it as the vaporinigs of axlisuppointod man." Foreign Commeuti^ -r

It is to accommodate 110 families, and is a six story structure of sucli massivo propor tion's as to attract attention from the river, which it faces. It extends 200 feet on Franklin street, 135 foot on India street and 7"i feet on Java street. The chief material used is lirown stone, brick and terra eotta.

All tho halls are fireproof. Tho stops aro heavy bluo stono sl:ils, inserted in bnclr walls. Tlio staircases aro nicely proportioned low risers, with broad steps. Tho turns aro niado on square platforms, with amplo light at each platform. These staircases aro kept heated, lighted with gas, and cleaned witliout expense to tho tenant. ROOMS AND THEIR KENT. The rents rango from $8.50 to $20 per month. For $20 there aro suites of seven rooms, every room with a window in it opening on a wide air space, giving two Sming ailors, a sittmg room, two bedrooms, a room, a kitchen and a scullery. The scullery goes with each set of apart ments, and its completeness 13 a great feature ot this building.

Each closet has shelves and hooks enough to meet tho wants of tho most closet worshiping matron. Tho plumbing work of the building is a vast network or pipes. Tho heaviest material in lea/1 and iron pipe was used. Eleven tanks, holding 25,000 gallons of water on tho roof, supply tho throo upper floors, and can be used also for tho threo lower floors in case the pressure is uot sufficient from the city pipe. ,, CELfAR AND BASEMENT. The bedrooms aVid' parlors aro trimmed with white wood,- filled, varnished and rubbed.. Great pains have been taken to secure a perfectly dry cellar and base ment.
