TO STIMULA TE ft GB EflT PROJECT President Roosevelt and Secretarj Riot Approve Plan—Has An other Conference at White House. Washington.—Wm. H. 'raft, pres ident-elect contemplates a visit to Panama before his inauguration. This visit is approved by President I£posevelt and Secretary Root. While it has not been finally determined upon Mr. Taft announced ~iat it tion to--» 1 **»>» » decision, Ùè wïtï leave the port of Charleston, S. C., prob ably the last week in January for a trip which will cover approximately twenty days. * There are many reasons, in Mr. Taft's view, why the trip of the president-elect to the isthmus would be of decided advantage to the ad vancement of the project and con sequently to the United States. President Roosevelt's visit proved a decided stimulus to the work; the three visits which Mr. Taft made as secretary of war were ail of advant age; there are constantly arising and accumulating many minor tan gles of administration and conflict of authority, which the presence of the president or the president-elect might make possible of eliminating with little difficulty. Mr. Taft feels that this is practi cally his only opportunity to visit the isthmus during his forthcoming term as president. The journey, if made, would un doubtedly be on one of the navy's best ships. The only objection to the expedi tion which has been pointed out by careful students of the laws and con stitution is that, pending the official declaration of Mr. Taft as president elect by the action of the electoral college and his inauguration as pres ident there is no constitutional or legal provision for the substitution of any one else in case anything hap pens to him in Panama. This objec tion is not regarded as of sufficient weight to detain Mr. Tatt from a journey which is regarded as essen tial to the success of one of the big enterprises of .his administration. The news of this trip followed a conference with President Rooseyelt and again at the the white house at luncheon and later with Secretary Root. Further details of the Roose velt-Root conference were not made known beyond the statement by Mr. Taft that the selection of .his cabinet was thoroughly discussed. BY

HIS CONFER ENCE W ITH CANNON s Prepared to Use Veto Power to k Keep Pledges. Asserts That the Speaker 's Attitude is Not Understood. Washington.—William H. Taft, President-elect, said that it was his belief that the House of Representa tives would make an "honest and thorough revision of the tariff" at the extra session, which he is to call for that purpose upon his inaugu ® ^'^^^TaftCetâtemlent, èôveriHSgr both Sts interview with Mr. Cannon and that with the Republicans on the Ways and Means Comimttee, follows: "I had an interview with Mr. Can non and with his concurrence and at the suggestion of a member of the Ways and Means Committee with the Republicans of that committee, and from my conversation with them and with the discussion which followed, and the examination which they are conducting and expect to conduct. I have every reason to be confident that they are keenly alive to the obligation which is on them as rep resentatives elected to represent the Republican party, to prepare an hon est and thorough revision of the près ent tariff. I was informed that they have taken three times as much ev idence as has been taken in the pre paration of other tariffs, and that they are going to make additional effort and independent effort to get at the evidence themselves by the use of subpoenas and under oath, with a view of reaching the differ ence in the cost of production of the various articles brought within the tariff .here and abroad. "I found them quite anxious for as much harmony as possible, in which I sympathized with them, and prepared for consultation on points of difficulty that might arise at any time in the future. The plan is to prepare a bill on such evidence as they have and will have in the course of the hearings, and then to call for additional evidence as to the Items whenever it should seem necessary. Not only from conversations with the members together, but with the mem bers separately, I am convinced that they are in good faith, going to pre pare a bill which is going to be a thorough revision on the basis of the platform of the Republican party. "The discussion covered other things, like the Philippine tariff, and I am very hopeful that there will be no difficulty in reaching an agree ment between the various people in terested in them—those represent ing the sugar and tobacco interests, so that there will be no dispute and that the matter may be incorporated in the new tariff bill without an is sue."

TWO 

MORE VICTIMS DIE. Aftermath of Battle Between Po lice and Fanatics. Kansas City, Mo.—Two more names were added to the list of dead as a result of t.he battle here be tween religious fanatics and the po lice, the total number now being four. Louis Pratt, the foremost disciple of James Sharp, died and an hour later Michael Mullane, a policeman, succumbed to his wounds. Mullane suffered himself to be mortally wounded because he would not shoot a -woman. According to witnesses he dodged behind a wagon when Mrs. Sharp attacked him with a revolver, and though she continued firing, he made no resistance.
