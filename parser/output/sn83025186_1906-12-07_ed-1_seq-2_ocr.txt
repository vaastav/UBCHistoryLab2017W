Now, It pos sesses in Its snout this peculiar virtue, that when Its nose approaches any thing hard, such as bones, those tough substances instantly grow soft, and enable the animal to eat them with comfort and benefit So you will find if you keep this charm hanging round your neck the proximity of the hyena's nese, though dried up and lifeless, will •often your food, however indigestible, to such an extent that you will never again suffer from indigestion.'"

There could be, we gratefully believe, no more sterling proof of opportunity and of character in America than these self-supporting youths now give. In what other nation would a boy born in poverty, earning each day his food and bed, set out cheerfuly to pass the examinations of a great seat of learn ing and, once In, to master to the full Its manifold weapons for adding to the conquests of his life?

An ambassador of a well-known Eu ropean monarch was riding In the streets of Constantinople when one of the sultan's carriages rolled by. See ing it was guarded, his curiosity got the better of him, and when the car riage reached him he was daring enough to peep in at the passenger. He was surprised and pained to re ceive a blow in the face from an at tendant in charge. Mad with rage, he demanded audience of the sultan. The sultan listened attentively, and for a moment appeared lost In thought At last he spoke: "My dear I have gone carefully Into the case, and see exactly how it stands. Tou are, of course, a gentleman, therefore you would never have committed such a breach of good manners as you allege to have taken place. Therefore no attendant could possibly have struck you.

Grinnell.—At the ninth session of the Iowa state conference of Chari ties and Corrections Judge James A. Howe, of Des Moines, spoke n"The Juvenile Court" He said in sub stance: While the Iowa juvenile court law is defective in some respects, and bet ter adapted to the rural communities and towns than to the large cities, It might with a few amendments be marie to meet the requirements of the entire State. The legislature, when It enacted the law, thought It would be enforced through the voluntary efforts and con tributions of the friends of the Juven ile work. 7xperience has proved that this is true In some communities where the work is light, and that it is not true in the large cities and congested centers of population where the work 1ft heavy. Children under the age of 16 years cannot, under the present law, be committed- to jail, but some place must 'be provided for itiern in cities where many of them are taken Into custody. The law should, therefore, be amended so as to provide a de tention home or school at public ex pense for such children In the large cities. In a city like Des Moines, where the work is extensive and system and organization are required for its suc cessful execution, regular probation officers are necessary, and tae viw should be so amended as to provide for them in the large cities. 

DOCTORS MAKE BIG BET*. One Cure Wagers $10,000 He Can Consumption. Fort Dodge.—Iowa physicians are watching with unusual interest a con troversy between Dr. Kime of Fort Dodge and Dr. Lindley of Cedar Rapids. The controversy involves a forfeit of $10,000 besides the interest ing and much-debated question of whether consumption can or cauuot be cured with drugs. Dr. Kime is a well known authority in this state on consumption. He is a member of the' state board of health and has Issued a number of bulletins on consumption. Dr. Kime main tains that no drug will cure the dis ease and recently offered $10,000 for proof that there is a drug that will cure tuberculosis. The offer is the result of a warm argument among physicians over the state. Dr. Kime take the stand that there is no cure in drugs and Is equally emphatic that there is no climate, system of feed ing, plan of exercise or amount of rest which will cure the white plague. Dr. Lindley has accepted t^e chal lenge of Dr. Kime and the medical profession of the state is wondering just how the novel wager will-be set tled. The Cedar Rapids doctor asks that three physicians. be named as judges. He will pame one, Dr. Kime one and the state board of control or the board of health the third. It Is expected that the state medical asso ciation will take up the matter of the wager between the two physicians. CHEER OVER GIRL'S FREEDOM. Women Go Wild in Murder Case at Council Bluffs.

THRONG IN* GALLERIES denat* Receives the President's Ap pointments but Waits for Message Before Confirming Them. Washington.—The fifty-ninth con gress began its last session at noon Monday. It took the senate 15 min utes to arrange Its preliminaries and the house an hour. The senate re ceived from President Roosevelt a long list of appointments for Its con firmation, and in an executive session of 19 minutes decided, as the nomina tions had been received before the body had been organized formally, to make no confirmations until the pres ident's annual message had been re ceived and the session fairly started. Senators Penrfee of Pennsylvania and Foraker of Ohio came forward with resolutions of inquiry regarding the discharge of the negro troops ol the twenty-fifth Infantry. One was ad dressed to the president and the other to the secretary of war. After the ripple of surprise had passed and Vice President Fairbanks had sug gested that it was unusual to trans act any business until the president's message had been received, the resolu tions "went over" by unanimous con sent Senator Dupont of Delaware took the oath of office. The openipg of the two houses was witnessed by an animated throng which filled the galleries to their capacity. Hundreds went away dis appointed in not gaining admission to witness the session of either senate or house. Seven cabinet changes and one ap pointment to the supreme court bench were sent to the senate by President Roosevelt, but they were not con firmed Immediately In accordance with general customs concerning such important nominations. Heretofore, the committees have been polled on the floor of the senate in executive session on cabinet appointments and, out of courtesy to the president, im mediately confirmed. The reason ad vanced for the change in the program is that no message of any character had been received from the president, and therefore it would not be proper to transact business.

All Conducted by C. V. Chandler Notices Posted Say They Are Short of Ready Cash. Peoria, 111. Three banking In stitutions in McDonough county, conducted by C. V. Chandler, of Ma comb, closed their doors after posting notices to the effect that the banks were short of ready cash. The banks are: The bank of Ma comb, conducted by C. V. Chandler it Co., having a deposit of $450,000, and capitalized at $50,000 the Chan dler & Imes bank at Colchester, capi talized at $25,000, having a deposit of $200,000, and the Chandler & Smith bank at Bardolph, capitalized at $25,000 with $50,000 in deposits. The money of the depositors in all three banks has been invested through Mr. Chandler, the senior member of the private banking firm in McDon ough county real estate, and the im mediate cause of suspension of the three institutions is given as a lack of ready cash. The Macomb bank stood good for the payment of the bonds of the Macomb and Western Illinois Electric railway, and when the bond holders made a demand for their money they absorbed all the ready cash of the three! institutions. C. V. Chandler has been in the banking business in Macomb for a quarter of a century, and in addition to his private holdings is treasurer of the Western Illinois State Normal School of Macomb and treasurer of the city of Macomb. It is not thought either the school or the city will lose by the failure of the banks. The state is protected by a trust company bond and the city's deposits in the bank are small at this time of the year. Mr. Chandler made a statement setting forth in effect what was stated in the notices posted on the doors of the banks. The liabilities are upwards of $700,000, with unincum bered real estate worth over $400,000. The mortgages are mostly on central Illinois farms and are considered gilt edge. There was little show of excitement over the closing of the banks. The depositors have faith in the word of Mr. Chandler and expect the fulfill ment of his promise. In Colchester the major part of the depositors are miners who made no demonstration when they read the notice on the doors of the bank. CLIFTON FLOOD RECEDES.

When No. 37 had entered the block Lawyers told me that No. 33 was by, and when. I asked him the time so I could record, he opened his key and did not reply. No. 37 had gone then."
