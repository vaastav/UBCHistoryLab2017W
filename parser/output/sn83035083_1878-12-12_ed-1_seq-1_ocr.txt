Fellow-Citizens of tiik Senate axd housk of representatives: Our heartfelt gratitude is due to the approved February 2Sth, 1871, entitled Divine Be'ng, who holds in His hands'' An act to amend an act approved the detti ales of nations, for the coutin- : May 13th, 1S70, entitled An act to en- ued best wal, during tlie last year, of eoantle s blessings upon onr country. We are at peace with all other na tion". Our public credit has greatly im- proved, and is, perhaps, now stronger than ever before. Abundant harvests have rewarded the labors of those who till the soil, our manufacturing indus tries are reviving, and it is believed thatgei.eral prosperity, which has been so anxiously looked for, is at last with in onr reach. The enjoyment of health by our peo ple generally has, however, been in terrupted, during the past season, by the prevalence of a fatal pestilence, the yellow fever, in some portions of the Southern states, creating an emergen cy which tatlled for prompt and extra ordinary measures of relief. The di sease appeared as an epidemic iu New Oi lean and at other places on the lower Mississippi, soon after midsum mer. It was rapidly spread by fugi tives from the infected cities and towns ami did not disappear until early in November. The states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee have suf fered severely. About one hundred thousand cases are believed to have oc curred, of which about tweuty thous and, according to intelligent estimates proved fatal. It is impossible to esti mate with any approach to accuracy the loss to Ihe country occasioned by this epidemic. It is to be reckoned by the hundred millions of dollars. The Buffering and destitution that resulted excited the deepest sympathy iu all parts of the Union. Physicians ami nurses hastened from every quarter to the assistance of the afflicted commu nities. Voluntary contributions of money and supplies, in every needed form, were seedily and generously furnished. The government was able to roapond in some measure to the call for help, by providing tents, medicines and food for the sick and destitute, the requisite directions for the purpose be ing given in the confident expectation that this action of the executive would receive the sanction of conjrress. About eighteen bandied tents and rations of the value of about twenty-live thous and dollars were sent t cities and towns which applied for them, full de tails of which will be furnished to congress by the proper Department. The fearful spread of this pestilence, has awakened a very general public sentiment in favor of national sanitary administration, which shall not only control quarantine, but have the sani tarv supervision of internal commerce iH times of epidemics, ami hold ut ad visory relation to the state and munic ipal health authorities, with power to b al with whatever endangers the pub lic health, and which the municipal and state authorities are unable to ivg ulate. The national quarantine act approved April 2, 1878, which was -Moved too late in the last session of congress to provide the means for car rying it iuto practical operation, dur ing the past season, is a step in the di rection here indicated. In view of the necessity for the most effective meas ures, by quarantine and otherwise, for the protection of our seaports, ami the country generally, from this and oth er epidemics, it is recommended that congress give to the whole subject ear ly and careful consideration. The permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection of all citizens in every civil and political right coutinues to be of paramount in terest with the great body of our peo ple. Every step iu this direction is welcomed 'with public approval, and every interruption of steady ami uui form progress to the desired consum mation awakens general uneasiness and wide-spread condemnation. The recent congressional elections have furnished a direct and trustworthy test of the advance thus far made iu the practical establishment of the right of suil'roge, secured by the Constitu tion to the liberated race in the South ern states. All disturbing influences, real or imaginary, had been removed from all these states. The three constitutional amend ments, which conferred freedom and equality of civil and political rights upon the colored people of the South, were adopted by the concurrent action of the great body of good citizens who maintained the authority of the na tional government and integrity and perpetuity of the Uuion at such a cost of treasure and life, as a wise and nec essary embodiment in the-organic law of the just results of the war. The peo ple of the former slave-holding states accepted these results, and gave, in every practicable form, assurances that the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, and laws passed iu pur suance thereof, should, in good faith, le enforced, rigidly and impartially, iu letter and spirit, to the end that the humblest citizen, without distinction of race or color, should, under them, receive full ami equal protection in lersoii and property and in political rights and privileges. By these con stitutional amendments the Southern section of the Union obtained a large increase of politcal power in con gress and the Electoral College, and the country justly expected that elec tions would proceed, as to the enfran chised race, upon the same circum stances of legal and constitutional free dom and protection which obtained in all the other utates of the Union. The friends of law and order looked for ward to the conduct of these elections, as offering to the general judgment, of the country an important opportunity to measure the tlegree in which the right of suffrage could be exercised by the colored jteople, and would he res- peeted by tneir lellow-crazens; but a more general. enjoyment of freedom of suffrage by the colored people, and a more just' and generous protection of I that freedom by the communities of I which they form a part, were general ly anticipated than the record ttf the elections disclose. In some of those stales in which the colored people have been unable to make their opin ions felt in the elections, (he result is mainly due to influences not easily measured or remedied by legal pro tection; hut in the states of Louisiana and South Carolina at large and in some particular congressional districts outside of those Mates, the records of Ihe elections seem to compel the con clusion that the rights of the Colored voters have been over-ridden, and their participation ia the elections not per mitted to be either general or free. It will lie for the congress for which these elections were held to make such examinations into their conduct us may he appropriate to determine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. In the meanwhile it be comes the duty of the Executive and Judicial Departments of the govern ment, each in its province, to inquire into and punish violations of the laws of the United (States which have oc curred. I can but repeat what I said in this connection in uiv last Message, that whatever authority rests with me to this end I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to the Legislaturesthe executive authorities, and the people of the states where these wrongs have been jerpetrated, to give their assist ance to bringing toajuutioe the offend ers and preventing a repetition of the crimes. No means within my power will be spared to obtain a full and fair investigation of the alleged crimes, and to secure the conviction and just pun ishment of the guilty. It ia to be observed that the prinel- pal appropriation made for the i mart-1 inent or Justice at the la.t session con tained the following elarse : "And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the enforcement of the act force the rights of citizens of United States in the several states of the Union and for other purposes,' or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto." It is the opinion of the Attorney Gen eral that the expenses of these pro ceedings will largely exceed the amount which was thus provided, and I rely coirfMently upon congress to make adequate appropriations to en able the Executive Department to en force the laws. I respecittilly urge upon your atten tion that the congressional elect Jons iu eveiy district, iu a very important sense, are justly a matter of political interest and concern throughout the whole country. Erch siate, every po litical party, is entitled to the share of power which is conferred by the legal and constitutional siifTVage. It is ihe right of every citizen possessing the qualifications prescribed by law, vo cast one unintimidated ballot and to have his ballot honestly counted. So long as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of this right are common and equal, practically as well as form ally, submission to the results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all the departments of government will feel the true vigor of the popular will thus expressed. No temporary or administrative interests of government, however urgent or weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of citizenship. They understand that the protection of liberty requires the maintenance, in full vigor, of the mauy methods of free speech, free nress, and free suffrage, ami will sus tain the full authority of the govern ment to enforce the laws which are framed to preserve these inestimable rights. The material progress and welfare of the states depend on the protection afforded to their citizens. There can be no peace without such protection.no prosperity without peace, and the whole country is deeply Inter terested in the growth ami prosperity of all Us parts. While the country has not yet reach ed complete uuity of feeling and re ciprocal confidence between the com munities so lately and seriously es tranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies an; in that direc tion, and with increasing force. The power of public opinion will override all political prejudces, and all sectional or state attachment, in demanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of citizens of the United States shall mean oue and the same thing, and carry with them un challenged security and respect. Our relations with other countries continue peaceful. Our neutrality in Contests between foreign powers has been maintained and respected. The Universal Exposition held at Paris during the past summer has been attended by large numbers of our citi zens. The brief period allowed for the preparation and arrangement of the contributions of our citizens to this great Exposition was well employed in energetic and judicious efforts to over come this disadvantage. These efforts, led and directed by the Commissioner General, were remarkably successful, and the exhibition of the products of American industry was creditable and gratifying in scope aud character. The reports of the United States commis sioners, giving its results in detail, will be duly laid before you. Our partici pation in this international competi tion for the favor aud trade of the world may be expected to produce use ful aud important results.iu promoting intercourse, friendship, aud commerce with other nations. In accordance with the provisions of the act of February 28th, 187S, three commissioners were appointed to an international conference on the sub ject of adopting a common ratio be tween gold and silver, for the purpose of establishing, internationally, the use of bimetallic money, and securing lixity of relative value between those metals. Invitations were addressed to the various governments which had ex pressed a willingness to participate iu its deliberations. The conference held its meeting in Paris, August last. The report ot the commissioners, herewith submitted, will show its result. No common ratio between gold and stiver could be ajjreed upon by the confer ence. The general conclusion was reached that it is necessary to main tain in the world the monetary func tions of silver as well as of gold, leav ing the selection of the use of one or the other of these two metals, or of both, to be made by each state. Congress having appropriated at its last session the sum of $.5,500,000 to pay the award of the Joint Commission at Halifax, if, after correspondence with the British government, on the subject of the conformity of the award to the requirements ot the treaty and to the terms of the question thereby submit ted to the commisiou, the President shall deem it his duty to make the pay ment, communications upon these points were addressed to the British government through the legation of the United States at Loudon. Failing to obtain the concurrence of the Brit ish government iu the views of this government respecting this award, 1 nave deemed it my duty to tender the sum named, within the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a notice of the grounds of the payment, and a pro- test against any other construction of the same. The correspondence upon tttis subject will belaid before you. TheSpuuUh government bfta official ly announced the termination of the insurrection in Cuba, aud the restora tion of peace throughout that island. Conlidetit expectations are expressed of a revival of trade and prosperity, which it is earnestly hoped may be welti'ound ed. Numerous claims of American citizens for relief lor injuries or restor ation of property, have been among the incidents of the long continued hostilities. Some of these claims are iu process of adjustment by Spain, and the others are promised early and care ful consideration. The treaty made with Italy, in re gard to reciprocal consular privileges, lias been duly ratified aud proclaimed. No questions of grave importance have arisen wilh any other of the Eu ropean powers. The Japanese government has been desirous of a revision of such parts of its treaties wilh foreign powers as re late to commerce, aud it is understood has addressed to each of the treaty powers a request to open negotiations with that view. The United States government has been inclined to re gard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictious upon trade with Japan are found injurious to that people cannot but allect injuriously nations holding commercial intercourse with them. Japan, after a loug jieriqd of seclusion, has within the nast few vears made rapid strides in the path of enlighten ment and progress, and, not unreason ably, is looking forward to the time when her relations with the nations of Europe and America shall be assimi lated to those which they hold with each other. A treaty looking to this eud has been made, which will be sub mitted for the consideration of the Senate. After au interval of several years, the Chinese government has again sent envoys to the United States. They have been received, aud a permaueut legation is now established here by doubted that government. It is not that this step will be of advantage to both nations In promoting friendly re lations and removing causes of nlfier ertce. The treaty with the Samoan Is lands, having been duly ratified and accepted on the p:rt of both govern- j ments, is now in operation, and a sur- vey ana soundings ot ine naroor oi Pago-Pago have been made by a naval vessel of the United States, with a view of its occupation as a naval station if found desirable to the service. Siuce the resumption of diplomatic relations with Mexico, correspondence has been' opened and still continues between the two governments upon the various questions which at one time seemed to eudauger their rela tions. While no formal agreement has been reached as to the troubles on the border, much has been done to repress aud diminish them. The effective force of the United States troops ou the Itio Grande, by a strict and faithful compliance with instructions, has done uiuciiUo remove the sources of dispute; and it is now understood Unit a like force of Mexican troop's on the 'other si. le of the river is also making an en ergetic movement against the ma rauding Indian tribes. This govern ment looks with the greatest satisfac tion upon every evidence of strength iu the national authority of Mexico, and upon every effort put forth to pre vent and punish incursions upon our territory. Iteliictaut to assume any action or attitude in the control of these incursions, by military move ments across the bonier, not impera tively demanded for the protection of the lives and property of our citizeus, I shall take the earliest opportunity consistent with the proper discharge of this plain duty, to recognize the abili ty of the Mexican government to re strain effectively violations of our ter ritory. It is proposed next year to hold an International Exhibition in Mexico, and it is believed that the dis play of agricultural and manufactur ing products of the two nations will tend to belter understanding and in creased commercial intercourse be tween their people. Wilh Brazil, and the republics of Central ami South A inerica, some steps have been taken toward the develop ment of closer commercial intercourse. Diplomatic relations have been resum ed with Columbia aud with Bolivia. A boundary question between ihe Ar gentine republic and Paraguay has been siihmuicd ly those, governments for arbitration to the President of the United Slates, and I have, after care j III! examination, given adecision upon I it. ' A naval expedition up the Atuz n I and Madeira rivers has brought hack information valuable both for scientific and commercial purposes. A like ex pedition is about visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian ocean. The re ports of diplomatic and consular ollicers in relation to ihe development of our foreign commerce have furnished many facts that have proved of public Interest and have stimulated to prac tical exertion the enterprise of our people. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury furnishes a detailed state ment of the operations of that depart ment of the government, and of the condition of the public finances. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ending June .;o, 1S7.S, were $257,7634878t.70.- the or dinary expenditures for the same peri od were J2;)(5,fM)4,i26.80 leaving a sur plus revenue for the year of $20,799, 551.90. The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June SO, 1879, actual and estimated, are as follows: Actual re ceipts for the first quarter commenc ing July 1, 1S7S, $73,289,743.43; esti mated receipts for the remaining three quarters of the year, $191,110,250.57 ; total receipts for tiie current fiscal year, actual aud estimated, $2l4,500,000. The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July 1, PS78, actual expenditures, $73,0.44,573. 27; and for the remaining three-quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at $166,755.426.73 making the total expenditures, $240, 1 00, 000, and leaving an estimated surplus rev enue, for the vear ending June 30, 1S7!, of $24,400,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year, euding June 80, 1880, esti mated according to existing laws, will he $264,500,000 ; and the es i mated or dinary expenditures for the same peri od will be $236,820,412.08; leaving a surplus of $2S,179,5S7.02 for that year. In the foregoing statements of ex penditures, actual and estimated, no amount is allowed for the sinking fund provided for by the act approved Feb ruary 25, 1862, which requires that one per cent, of the entire debt of the United States shall be purchased or paid wit bin each fiscal year to be set apart as a sinking fund. There has been, however, a substantial compli ance with the conditions of the law. By its terms, the public debt should have been reduced between 1862 and the close of the last fiscal year, $518, 361,806.28; the actual reduction of the ascertained debt, in that period, has been $720,644,739.61 ; being iu excess of the reduction required by the siuk i ng act $202,2S2,9:".8 33. The amount of the public debt, less cash iu the Treasury, November 1, 1878, was$J,024,2(M,()S.!. 18 a reduction since the same date last year, of $28, -150,617.39. The progress made during the last year in refunding the public debt at lower rates ol interest is very gratify- j iug. The amount of four per cent, bonds, commonly known as five-twenties, to au equal amount, have been, or will ho redeemed as calls mature. It has been the policy of the depart- j ineut to place the four per cent, bonds within easy reach of every citizen who desires to invest his savings, whether small or great, iu these securities. The ; Secretary of the Treasury recommends thai the law be so modified that small sums may be invested, and that ' through the post offices. or other aged ts 1 of the government, the freest ppportu- : pity may be given in all parts of the country for such Investments. The best mode suggested is that the department be authorized to issue cer- : tifleates Of deposit of the denomination of too dollars, bearing interest at the rate of 3.65 per cent, per annum and convertible at any time within one! year after their issue into the four per cent bonds authorized by the refund ing act, and to be issued only in ex- ' change for United States notes sent to ' the Treasuary by mail or otherwise. Such a provision of taw, supported by suitable regulations, would enable any person readily, without cost or risk, to convert his money into an interest bearing security of the United States, and the money so rcoeived coujd be applied to the redemption of six per cent, bonds. The coinage of gold during the last fiscal year was 

$"2,7!IS,!IS0. The coin age of silver dollars, under the act passed February 28, 1S7S, amounted on the 23rd day of November, 1878, to 19, 814,550, of which amount 4,984,947 are in circulation, and the balance, 14,820, 603, is still in possession of the govern ment. With views unchanged with regard to the act under which the coinage of silver proceeds, it has been the pur pose of the Secretary faithfully to exe cute the law anil to afford a fair trial of the measure. In the present financial condition of I during the past years that additional the country, I am persuaded that the ' legislation is imperative to relieve and welfare of the legitimate business ami j prevent the delay of justice, aud pos indurtry of every description will be j si hie oppression to suitors, which is best promoted by abstaining from all j thus occasioned. The encumbered attempts to make radical ohauges in condition of these dockets is presented the existing financial legislation. Let it be understood that during the eom iug year the business of the country will he undisturbed by governmental interference with the laws affecting it, and we may confidently expect that the! resumption of specie payments which will take place at the appointed time, will be successfully and easily utaiued, and that it will be tollow- y a healthful and enduring revival of-business prosperity. "Let the healing influences of time, tho inherent energies of our people, aud the boundless resources of our country have a fair opportunity, and relief from present difficulties will surely follow. The report of the Secretary of War shows that the army has been well and economically supplied, that our small force has been actively employed and has faithfully performed all the service required of it. The morale of thearmy has improved, and the nura berof desertions has materially de creased during the year: IShe Secretary recommends If That a pension be grained to the widow of willow,' QJ the late lieutenant Henry- rffTienttpr, 18th Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever while in command of the steamer J. at. Chambers, sent with supplies for the relief of sufferers in the South from that disease. 2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for the beuetit of the heirs of deceased officers, as suggested by the Paymaster General. 3. The adoption by congress of a plan for the publication of the records of the war of the rebellion, now being pre pared for that purpose. 4. The increase of the extra per diem of soldier-teachers employed in post schools, and liberal appropriations for the erection of buildiugs for schools and iibraries at the different posts. 5. The repeal of the amendment of the act of June 18, 1878, forbidding the " use of thearmy as a posse comitatus, or otherwise, for the purpose of exe cuting the laws, except iu such cases and under such circumstances as may be expressly authorized by the consti tution or by act or congress." 6. The passage of a joint resolution of eougress legalizing the issues of ra tions, tents and medicines which were made for the relief of sufferers from yellow fever. 7. That provision be made for the erection of a tire-proof building for the preservation of certain valuable rec ords, now constantly exposed to ties- tiuctiou by tire. l hcsc reeoiiimeudal ions are all com mended to your favorable considera tion. file report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that the unvy has improv ed during' t he last fiscal year. Work has been done on seventy five vessels, ten of which have been thoroughly repaired, ami made ready for sea. Two others are in rapid progress toward completion. The total expenditures of the year, including tlie amount ap propriated for the deficiencies of the previous year, were S1 7,408,3:12.65. The actual expenses chargeable to the year, exclusive of these deficiencies, were $13,306,914.09, or $767,199.18 less than those of the previous year, and $4,f28, 677.74 less than the expenses, includ ing the deficiencies. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, arc $14,562,381,45 exceeding the ap propriations oj" the present year ouly $38,949.75; which excess is occasioned by the demands of the Naval Academy and the Marine Corps, as explained in the Secretary's report. Tlie appropria tions for the present fiscal year are $14,528,481.70, which, in the opinion of the Secretary, will be ample for all the current expenses of the Department during the year, Thegamount drawn from the Treasury from July 1 to No vember 1, 1S78, is $4,740,544.14, of which $70,980.75 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period $4,669,563,39, or $520,899.24 less than the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. The report of the Postmaster Gener al embraces a detailed statement of the operations of the Fost Office Depart ment. The expenditures of that De partment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, were $34,,165,084 49. The receipts, including sales of stamps, money order business, aud official stamps, were $20,277,516.95. The sum of $290,436.90, included m the foregoing statement of expenditures, is charge able to preceding years, so that the actual expenditures for the fiscal year eliding June 30, 1S78, are $33,S74,647.50. The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to the reveuues of the Department, was $5, 07,652.S2. The expenditures for the fiscal year euding June 30, 1SS0, are estimated at $36,671,900, and the re ceipts from all sources at $30;664, 023.5)0, leaving a detieieifcy io be appropriat ed out of the Treasury of $5,947,S76.10. Thereportcallsattentiou to thefact that the compensation of postmasters aud of railroads for carrying the mail is regulated by law, aud that the failure of congress to appropriate the amounts required for these purposes does not relieve the government of responsibil ity, but necessarily increases the de ficiency bills which congress will be called upon to pass. Iu providing for the postal service the following questions are presented : Should congress annually appropriate a sum for its expenses largely in excess of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be established as will make the department self-sustaining? Should the postal service be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which does not pay its way? Should the number of post routes be diminished? Should other methods be adopted which will increase the reveuues or diminish the expenses of the postal service? The International postal congress, which met at Paris May 1, 1878, and continued iu session utdil June -1 of t he same year, was composed of dele gates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It adopted a new convention, to take the place of the treaty concluded at Berne, Octo ber 9, 1.874, which 

ROBS into effect on the 1st of April. 1879, between the couulries whose delesr ttes h ive siirned il. It Was ratified and approved, by and with tiie consent of the "Ptesi- dent," August 13, 1878. A synopsis of this universal postal convention will be found iu the report of the l'ostmas- ter General, and the lull text in the appendix tltereto. In its origin the Postal Union comprised twenty-three countries, baveing a population of three hundred and fifty millions of peopte. On the 1st of April next it will com prise forty-three Countries and colo nies, with a population of more than six hundred and fifty millions of peo ple, and will soon, by the accession of the few remaining countries and colo nies which maintain organized postal services, constitute, in fact as well as ' .... . .. . uame, as its new title indicates, a in Universal tJnion, regulating, upon a uniform basis of cheap postage rates, the postal intercourse between all civ ilized nations. Some embarrass men t has arisen out of the eohffltti between the customs laws of this country and the provisions of the postal convention, in regartl to the transmission of foreign hooks and newspapers to this oouutiy by mail. It is hoped that congress will be able to devise some njeans qf reconciling I the difficulties which have thus been i created, so as to do justice to all parties involved. The business of the Supreme Court, I and of the courts in many of the cir I cuits, has increased to such an extent anew in the report of the Attorney General, and the remedy suggested is earnestly ur.ed for congressional act ion. The creation of additional Cir cuit Judges as proposed, would afford a complete remedy, aud would involve au expense at the present rate of sal ariesof not more than $60,000 a year. The annual reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commission er of Indian Affairs present au elabor ate account of the present condition of the Indian tribes, and of that branch of the public service which ministers to their interests. While the conduct of the Indians, generally, has been or derly, and their relations with their neighbors friendly and peaceful, two local disturbances have occurred, whit-h were deplorable in their character, but remained, happily, confined to a com paratively small number of Indians. The discontent among the Bauuocks, which led first to some acts of violence on the part of some members of the tribe and finally to the outbreak, ap pears to have been caused by au insuf ficiency to have been owing to the in adequacy of the appropriations made by congress, to the wants of the Indi ans, at a time when the Iudiaus were prevented from supplying the deficien cy by huaticg. After an arduous pur suit by the troops of the United States, aud several engagements, the hostile Indians were reduced to subjection, aud the larger part of them surrender ed themselves as prisoners. In this connection, I desire to call atteutiou to the recommendation made by the Sec retary of the Interior, that a sufficient fund be placed at the disposal of the Executive, to be used, with proper ac countability, at discretion, in sudden emergencies of the Indian service. The other case of disturbance was that of a band of Northern Cheyeuues who suddenly left their reservation-in the Indian territory aud inarched rap idly through the slates of Kansas aud Nebraska in the direction of their old hunting grounds, committing murders and other crimes on their way. From documents accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Interior, it ap pears that this disorderly baud wits as fully supplied with the necessaries of life as the four thousand seven hund red other Indians who remained quiet ly on the reservation, and that the dis turbance was caused by men of a rest less and mischievous disposition among the Indians themselves. Almost the whole of this baud have surrendered to the military authorities, and it is a gratify ing fact that, -a hen some of them had taken, refuge iu the camp of the Red Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held I hem as prisoner.-and read ily gave them up Iti the officers of I he Uulted Slates, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which alaiming nj m.r.s to ttie contrary nkwitiitadius, 1 hey have UUl orufty shown ever since the wishes they expressed at the couu cil of September, 1877, had beeu com plied with. Both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of War unite iu the recommendation that provision be made by congress for the organization of a corps of mounted Indian auxili aries," to be under the control of the army, and to be used for tlie purpose of keeping the Indians on t heir reser vations and preventing or repressing disturbance on their part. I earnestly concur in this recommendation. It is believed that the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from e government, would Considerably weaken the rest less element among the Indians by withdrawing from it a number of young men and giving them congenial employment under the goverumeut, it being a matter of experieuce t hat In dians in our service almost wit hoot ex ception are faithful iu the performance of the duties assigned to them. Such an organization would materially aid the army iu the accomplishment of a task for which its numerical strength is sometimes found insufficient. But, while the employment of force for the prevention of Indian troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation should be made to that eud, greater reliance must be placed on humane and civilizing agencies for the ultimate solution of what is called the Indian problem. It may be very dif ficult and require much patient effort to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian to the restraints of civilized life, but experience shows that it is not impossible. Many of the tribes which are now quiet aud orderly and self supporting were once as savage as any that at present roam over the plains or in the mountains of the far west, and were then considered inac cessible to civilizing influences. It may be impossible to raise them fully up to the level of the white population of the United States ; but we should not forget that they are the aborigines of the country, and called the soil their own ou which our people have grown rich, powerful and happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty to help them in attaining at least that degree of civ ilization which they .may be able to reach. It is not only our duty it is our interest to do so. Indiaus who have become agriculluristsor herdsmen, and feel au interest in property, will thence forth cease to he a warlike and disturb ing element. It is also a well authen ticated fact that Indians are apt to be peaceable and quiet when their chil dren are at school, and I am gratified to know, from the expressions of In dians themselves and from mauy con curring reports, that there is a steadi ly increasing desire, even among Indians belonging to comparatively wild tribes, to have their children ed ucated. 1 iuvite attention to the re ports of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioners of Indian Af fairs touching the experiment recently inaugurated, in taking fifty Indian children boys and girls, from different 1 - . ' . tribes, to the Hampton Normal Agri Cultural Institute, iu Virginia, where they are -to receive an elemeutary fSnjgiish eduaation and training iu ag riculture and oilier useful work, to be returned to their tribes after the eom- Dieted course, as interpreters, instruct- lorsaud examples. It is reported that the officer charged with the selection of those children might have had i thousands of youug iudiaus seut with i hint bad it been possible to make pro Vision lor them. 1 agree Willi the ; Secretary of the interior in saying that I the result of this interesting experi- ment, if favorable, may be destined j to become' au important factor iu the ! advancement of civilization among the I Indians. The question whether a change iu j the control in the Indian service should j be made, was, at the last session of congress, referred to a committee for inquiry and report- W ithout desiring j to anticipate the report. I venture to I a. I il. - A.1 .1 . S J a I express the hope that in the decision of so important a question the views ex pressed above may not be lost sight of, and that the decision, whatever it may be, will arrest further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as on the Indians them selves. in the enrollment of the bill making appropriations for sundry civil ex penses, at the last session of cougress, that portion which provided for the continuation of the Hot Springs Com mission was omit ted. As t he Com mission had completed the work of taking testimony on the many conllicliug claims, the suspension of their labors, before determining the rights as claimants, threatened for a time, to embarrass the interests, not only of the government, but also of a large number of tlie citigens of Hot Springs, who were waiting for final action ou their claims before beginuiug contemplated improvements. Iu order j copyright system of the country, as to to prevent serious difficulties, which ; demand the prompt and careful atten -were apprehended, aud at the solicita- i tion of cougress to save it from injury tion of many leading citizeus of Hot j iu its present crowded and insufficient j ted in the i welfare of the town, the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to request the late com mission rs to take charge of the records of their proceedings, ami to perform such work as could be done under such circumstances, to facilitate the future adjudication of. the claims at au early day, and to preserve the status of the claimants until their rights should be finally determined. The late commissioners complied with that request, aud report that the testimony in all the cases has been written out, examined, briefed, aud so- arranged as to facilitate au early settlement when authorized by law. It is recommend ed that the requisite authority be given at as early a day in the session as pos sible, and that a fair compensation be allowed the late commissioners for the expense incurred and the labor per formed by them since the 25th of June last. I invite the attention of congress to the recommendations made by the Secretary of the Interior with regard to the preservation of the timber on the public lauds of the United States. The protection of the public property is one of the first duties of the govern-' ineut. The Department of the Interi or should, therefore, beeuabled by suf ficient appropriations, to enforce the laws in that respect. But this matter appears still more important as a ques tion of public economy. The rapid destruction of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest consequences, especially in the mountainous districts, where the rocky slopes once denuded of their trees, will remain so forever. There the injury, once done, cannot be repaired. I fully concur with the Sec retary of the luterior in the opinion that, for this reason, legislation touch ing the public timber in the mountain ous states and territories of the West should be especially well considered, aud that exisliug laws, iu which the destruction of the forests is not suffi ciently guarded should be . speedily modified. A general law concerning this important subject appears to me to be a matter of urgent public neces sity. From the organization of the govern ment, the importance of encouraging, by all possible means, the increase of our agricultural productions has been acknowledged and urged upon the at tention of congress and the people as the surest and readiest means of in creasing our substantial and eudurfng prosperity. Tiie words of Washington are as ap plicable to-day as when, in his eighth annual message, he said: " It is not tp be doubted thul, n ith reference cull er to individual or national welfare, agriculture is or primary importance in proponiou as ualious advance in population and oilier ri tfuminnm u o. maturity, this truth becomes more ap parent, and renders the cultivation of soil more and more an object of pub lic patronage. Institutions for pro moting it grow up, supported by the public purse aud to What object can it l dedicated with greater propriety ? Among the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of boards composed of proper characters, charged with col lecting and diffusing information, aud enabled, by premiums and small pecu niary aids, to encourage and assist the spirit of discovery and improvement, this species of establishment contrib uting doubly to the increase of im provement by stimulating to enter prise and experiment, and by drawing to a common center the results every where of individual skill aud observa tion, ami spreading them thence over the whole nation. Experience accord ingly hath shown that they are very cheap instruments of immense bene fit." The great preponderance of the ag ricultural, over auy other interest in the United States entitles it to all con sideration claimed for it by Washing ton. About one-half of the population of the United States is engaged in ag riculture. The value of the agricultu ral products of the United States for the year 1S78, is estimated at three thousand millions of dollars. The ex ports of agricultural products for the year 1877, as appears from the report of the Bureau of Statistics, were five hun dred and twenty-four millions of dol lars. The great extent of our country, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables us to produce withiu our own borders, and by our own labor, not on ly the necessaries but most of the lux uries that are consumed in civilized countries. Yet, notwithsianding our advantages of soil, climate, and inter communication, it appears from the statistical statements iu the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture, that we import annually from foreign lands many millions of dollars' worth of agricultural products which could be raised in our own country. Numerous questions arise in the practice of advanced agriculture which can ouly be answered by experiments, ofteu costly and sometimes fruitless, which are beyond the means of private individuals, and are a just and proper charge on the whole nation for the benefit of the nation. It is good poli cy, especially in times of depression and uncertainty iu other business pur suits, with a vast area of uncultivated, and hence unproductive territory, wisely opened to homestead settlement to eucourage, by every proper ami le gitimate means, the occupation and tillage of the soil. The efforts of the Department of Agriculture to stimu late old and introduce new agricultural industries to improve the quality and increase the quantity of our products, to determine the value of old or estab 1 lish the importance of new methods of I i . . C C . 1 culture, are wormy oi yout careiut aim mat uouni oe ueccssai wuuiu Lie i favorable consideration, and assistance ! dig ditches, aud lead the brine to ba by such appropriations of money aud ' sius iu the nearest deserts. The heat enlargement of facilities as may seem j of the sun would make the salt Wore to be demanded by the present favor- able conditions tor the growth aud i rapid depelopment of this importaut interest. The abuse of animals in transit isl widely attracting public attention. A national convention of societies speci ally interested iu the subject has re- j oently met iu Baltimore and the facts developed, both in regard to cruellies to animals uud the effect upon the public health, would seem to demand the careful consideration of congress and the enactment of more erficieut laws for the prevention of these abuses. The report of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Education shows very gratifyin'g progress throughout the country, in all the interests committed to the care of this important office. The report is especially encouraging j with respect to the extension of ihe advantages of the com nioii. school sys tern in sections of the country where the general enjoyment of the privilege ol tree school is not yet attained. To education more than to any other ageucy we are to look as the resource for the advancement of the people, in the requisite kuowledge and apprecia tion of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, ami I desire to repeat the suggestion contained iu my former message in behalf of the enactment of appropriate measures by congress for the purpose of supplementing, with national aid, the local systems of edu cation iu the several states. Adequate accommodations for tiie great library, which is overgrowing t he capacity of the rooms now occupied at the Capitol, should be provided without further delay. The invalua ble collection of books, manuscripts and illustrative art has grown to such proportions, in connection with the quarters, ivs this library is national - in its character and must, from tho nature of the case, increase even moro rapidly in the future than in the past, . it cannot be doubted that the people will sanction auy wise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its useful ness. The appeal of the Regents of tho Smithsonian Institution for the means to organize, exhibit and make availa ble for the public benefit the articles -now stored away belonging to the Na- tional Museum, I heartily recommend to your favorable consideration. The attention of congress is again invited to the conditiou of the river front of the city of Washington. , It i a matter of vital importance to the health of the residents of the National 1 Capital, both temporary aud perma nent, that the lauds iu front of the city I now subject to tidal overflow, should be reclaimed. In their present Onnttf tion, these fiats obstruct the 'drainage" of the. city, and are a dangerous aouroe of malarial poison. . The reelamatvm i will improve the navigation of the riv- ; er, by restricting and consequently deepening its channel ; and is also of importance, when considered iu con-, j nection with the extension of the pub- . lie ground and the enlargement of the park, west and south of the Washing ton Monument. The report of the Board of Survey, heretofore ordered by act of congress, on the improve ment of the harbor of Washing' on and Georgetown, is respectfully commend ed to consideration. , The report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia presents a de tailed statement of the affairs of the District. The relative expenditures by the United States and the District for local purposes is contrasted, showing ftfaV' the expenditures by the people of -the District greatly exceed those of the general government. The exhibit is made in connection with estimates for the requisite repair of the defective pavements and sewers of the city, which is a work of immediate necessi ty, aud, in the same connection, apian is presented for the permanent funding of the outstanding securities of the District. : ''. it The benevolent, reformatory aud penal institutions of the District are all entitled to the favorable attention of congress. The Reform School needs, additional buildings and teachers. Appropriations which will plaee all of' these institutions iu a conditiou to he come models of usefulness and b'eiiifi eenee will be regarded by the country as liberality wisely bestowed. - iSW The Commissioners, with evident justice, request attention to the dis crfmiiiatiou made by congress against lite Dish ict-in ihe donation of laud for tlie support ot the public schools aud a-k that the same liberality that has been shown to the inhabitants of the variwus states and territories of the United Slates tuay be extended to the District of Columbia. The Commissioners also invite at tention to the damage inflicted upon, the public and private interests by the present location of the depots and switching tracks of the several rail roads entei-ing the city, aud ask for legislation looking to their removal. The recommendations and suggestions contained iu ihe report will, I trust, receive the careful consideration of congress. Sufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed siuce the reorganization of the government of the District, under the recent legislation of cougress, for the expression of a confident opinion as to its successful operation ; but the prac tical results already attained are so sat isfactory that the friends of the new government may well urge upon con gress the wisdom of its continuance, without modification, until, by actual experience, its advantages aud defects may be more fully ascertained.
