And it will bo observed that tho presi of tho Kansas Alliance "riz" up and becondedtho motion to adopt tho said resolutions. The Eort Scott Monitor takes Eugene "Ware to task for speaking of farmers as "rural roosters." But, como to think of it, this is natural; the Monitor man's father belongs to that crowd, and while the Monitor may crow over tho "old man," it don't relish it when douo by anybody else. "What with the congress and tho Farm ers' Alliance in session, the English par liament and tho Parnell imbroglio, tho Indian trouble, in addition to tho usual grist of happenings unci transpirings, tho demands of tho readers of daily pa pers for interesting and sensational mat ter is pretty well supplied just now. The Bank of England has 2-l,CS0,000 in coin and bullion, and ik reserve to 1G,o00,000. At a corresponding date last year it had only 20,11)3,000 in coin and bullion and 12,500,000 reserve.

The president of tho Kansas Farmers' Alliance protests against a call being promulgated for a national convention to c rgoii'7.o a third party until after tho Kansas legislature shall have adjourned.

A wiser thing would be to sit down on tho proposed movement at onco and with emphasis. Tt is said that a tramp found $14 in an old vest which had boon given to him by Father Buyso of Jackson, Mich., and returned the money to tho priest. There is nothing very remarkablo in the oc currence. The tramp had no uso for the money; it is easier for him to pursue his occupation of asking alms from house to house in his old clothes than in new ones if he had so used the money; and as for food, the "handout" is both suro and sufficient for his dailv wants. The Eagle acknowledges the receipt of an invitation to tho opening of tho New Yoik World's new Pulitzer build ing; also, an enclosed card of admit tance to the chumpagno supper, "It. S. V. P.," which is to follow. Our polico coinmis ion and other prohibitory envi ronments will ronder tho acceptance of tho kind invitation an impossibility. Tho new building is very grand and high, very high; tho highest in tho World; but tho World ought to know that wo Kansana aro not pormitted to go oil on a "high." A 

WONDERFUL EPITOM5. The readers of the Eagle are not un acquainted with the extraordinary abili ties of Mr. C. Wood Davis as an expert statistician, nor ignorant of the fact of his authorship of Borne wonderfully far reaching and comprehensive papers bear ing on the economic conditions of this and of other countries, which papers have from time to time appeared in the Forum and other publications. He has not only a genius for figures but evi dently delights in the pursuit of ulti mates through the labyrinths of numerals and official data. In the discussion of the food-grains problem and their past, present and probable future prices, he has given mouths of constant research. Luckily for him he has a personal friend, who is much given to figures, residing in London who has access to all the British records and reports, covering the dependencies of Australia and India. He has also a friend in Russia who has been enabled to secure the data, tho av erages, etc., of the crop products, popu lation, etc.. of that country and its de pendencies. In pursuing these fields for facts bearing on the present and future of the farmers of America, and incident ally, for facts bearing on tho Henry George single tax theory, Mr. Davis has como into the possession of the world's economic methods and measures, which ho has reduced down to their uisinence ot seven tables which he ha placed on a single sheet of cap paper with explanatory marginal and foot notes, and which makes "An Epitome of the agricultural situation and an estimate of American productions and requirements for four quiquenial periods." A copy of this Epitome lies before us with more in formation and of reliable facts, of wide spread interest, than wo over saw lxsfore in so circumscribed a form. To tell all the facts held by this small sheet in detail would require a book of several hundred pages. Its exhibits aro not only accurate but its conclusions irrefut able. The historv of breadstuff's and their prices for the whole world are mirrored in oflic.al figures for tho past, and what must inevitably occur in tho future shown. How many readers of the Eagle, for instance, know that within tho present century wheat sold in Liverpool for o.SO per bushel in gold? Ono table shows tho increase of culti vated area in tho United States for twenty years and the rate per cent of in crease: another the twenty years' ex ports of wheat from India and the Uni ted States; another the annual average of wheat in England and at Chicago and the annua! average values per bushel of wheat exported from the United States. This last exhibit shows that from 1871 to 1S89 tho price of British grown wheat, as measured in gold, in the local mar kets of Great Britain, shrank (-17) fortj-- beven per cent, as against a fall of (33) thirty-three per cent in the currency price at Chicago, and (31) thirty-ono per cent in tho valuo of American wheat exported, which wide difference in de preciation of the products of British and A mericau farms does not appear to bo due to either protection or free trade,and is evidently not duo to a change in America from an inconvertible paper to a coin standard of value. In short this wonderfully succinct and reliable epitome seems to contain more facts bearing on tho food products of the world than is known to all tho United States congress, or at least more than they have ever disclosed in their discus sions of these problems. According to these tables there will be a deficit in the food grains of tho world in July, 1891, of l.VJ,000,000 bushels. But wo can go no further in these mat tors without disclosing more of tho val ues of Mr. Davis' labors than we would bo warranted in doing, and will close the allusion by quoting a single deduc tion, wnicn win uo ot interest to every body: "Granting the substantial correctness of tho data containe i in the accompany ing exhibits, tho farmer will very soon 1h?. bv far, tho most prosperous member 1 of tho community wherever in tho 'world he owns and cultivates lands of average fertility producing the staple food, forage anil fiber crops of tho tem perate zone." For further information touching this epitome, Mr. Davis should be addressed in person or by letter, he having had only a few copies printed at a consider able cost the matter is more called for than blind enthusiasm or blunt depreciation. Thb will be to the ultimate advantage of the discovery. There was really slight ground for the extravagant beliefs concerning the scope and efficacy of this new rem edy. Whatever of merit there is in it will probably only be fully discovered after longer investigation, and the calm that has succeeded tho excitement will be conducive to that end. The Eagle knows tliat there is such a place as Kansa city, and that there is another place in Missouri bearing the same name. When we, therefore, talk of peculations of Kansas City grain mer chants, etc., forgetting to add tho word "Missouri," we hope George Martin will remember this and restrain himself ac cordingly. The Missouri town, in all that constitutes a progressive and honest municipality, may be sadly wanting, yet it is, nevertheless, a town of more or less metropolitan troubles and pretensions, which should not wholly oo ignored by its proud and more prosperous neighbor on tho north bank of the Kaw. ers" of our government intended it should be. no other reply should be made to such requests. The Baptists are evi dently on the right side of this question. It is tobewondered,however,if those who favor compulsoiv religious instruction in the public schools, will now class the Baptists, as they have others who op pose the theory, with infidels, foreign ers, saloon-keepers and thugs, and say they are enemies of God, the govern ment, good religion and humanity.

GALVESTON. To the Editor ot tho Eagle. In this far southern city I enjoyed quito a peculiar experience Tuesday. President Harrison in his message to congress made quito an extensive refer ence to the work now going on to ob tain deep water at this harbor. Every body was reading and commenting upon the president's message as though it was borne local affair, and Mr. Harrison would certainly havo appreciated the kind things said of him, could he have been within earshot At noon the authoriti s of the city had twenty-one guns fired in honor of the president and tho mayor telegraphed to the Texas delegation in Washington, asking them to go in a body and present to Mr. Harrison tho thanks of the citizens of Galveston. Tho piesident appreciates Galves ton's commanding position for con trolling the Pan-American commerco and the trade of the great west. His reference to steamship lines is in a di rect lino with the organization of tho Pan-American Transportation company, which will put on a line of steamers starting from Galveston to connect witii all ports of South and Central America, Mexico and Cuba. Their general offices are established at Galveston. Wichita as tiie principal railroad cen ter of theve.-.t,and having direcL railroad communication with this port should handle the tropical fruits for 50,000 peo ple directiy tributary to her. I have stood on the docks and watched bananas loaded on the cars for Wichita, and they go through by fast freight to the "Peer less Princess" in car-load lots. On an From the Douglass Tribune. We were talking the other day with several parties, some of them farmers, about the financial condition of the coun ty, and the hard times, when we called attention to an incident we knew of sev eral years ago, where a farmer supposing himself to bo hopelessly in debt, nad tried to sell his farm. But before he could find a purchaser ho raised a crop of corn which he sold as it stood in the field for five dollars more an aero than he had asked for land and all. Another spoke of corn selling in the field at twen- ty-nve dollars per acre a tew years ago. Another said that his surplus corn of last year's crop, which he could have held," and which he did hold until he sup posed tho right time had come to sell, would be worth now the neat sum of $3,000. Another pointed out an instance where a neighbor Had saved his surplus corn of last year's crop and can now realize thirty dollars per acre for it the worth of the land on which it grew. Instances were pointed out where farmers had been and are still making money not a mere living, but accumulating riches, and large inde pendence. Some are buying other farms and seeking safe investments for the sur plus money their crops or their stock havo brought them. Some are building new houses and new barns, and paying the cash as they go. Others, who have been in debt, are paying out and thus becoming independent. There aro end less evidences of prosperity all over this country, and not a single case of suffer ing or destitution. Then, what is the use of these wails of distress this financial hypocondrai. A countrv like this is sure to be prosixjrous. Temporary reverses may be expected, but general growth and prosperity are founded on the surety of rich land, a temperate climate and a kind Provi dence. Suppose some men have made bad in vestments on a falling market, don't such things occur everywhere? Suppose some of us have signed away in mort gages interest to property we hold that thieatens to take it all, others before us sold out their entire interests in just such property for much less than we got for our mortgages. We are not less fortu nate than they. Suppose tho govern ment were to step in and pay off our debts, would we go in debt as readily as wo mortgaged the homestead that gov ernment freely gave us here in the west, and again be calling for government re lief? Thero aro plenty of bright opportuni ties and encouraging prospects for all around us the thing to do is to use good common sense, look on tiie hopefull side of affairs, pay our debts as fast .is we can, and keep out of debt in tho future. Thus we shall turn reverses into success and enjoy tho prosperity that others are enjoying here m our midst. suming industries. Indeed, the man agers of the Hutchinson and Southern railroad are expecting soon to be called upon to keep an engine and a large lay out of box cars in Kingman to accom modate this business. A

It is to be hoped that the legislature soon to assemble will remember that i Topeka, the capitol city of the state, has claims upon them to be seriously consid ered. The political claims of that city havo been generally neglected, and we aro glad to see that self sacrificing citi zens are coming to the front, to claim their rights. The modesty of the town is well known in times past, and it has often been a matter of surpi ise that her citizens were so backward in seeking ollice. Thero is from there at least two candidates for United States senator and four for state printer two R.-miblicans and two People's party men. It is a fact that to-day and for many yeurs Topeka has furnished from twelve to fifteen of the lvst paid officers in the state. But that is not enough. Thev do not want The latest political club in Kansas is called the "Knights of Reciprocity." It is claimed that a lot of English money will be sent to Kansas to defeat IngalLs. Two years ago Grover Cleveland's letter to .Acers would havo re-elected Ingalls be yond a doubt. Sanator Ingalls will never forgive Grov er Cleveland for the discovery of "innocu ous desuetude." The good things in the Wellington Press that are not written by Jake Stotler, are written by his son, Will. It is a fact that Bill Rice and the gen eral, his father, did not speak for three months proceeding the election. If General Rice isn't careful, when the Alliance organizes a national party, they will take particularpains to leave him out. Belva Lockwood is going to lecture at 0sawatomle, Kansas, December 10. The title of her lecture is "Is Marriage a Fail ure? XoSir." Judge Peffet has a little advantage of the other Alliance candidates for the Uni ted States senate. He stands iu with the associated press. Mrs. Lease says she has too many ene mies to leave the state. This is the first time the "woman" has cropped out in Mrs. Lease since her advent. An Alliance man said yesterday that as he was an obscure and unknown farmer he didn't see any reason why he should not be mentioned for the United Suites senate. The last issue of Harper's Weekly con tains portraits of two of the new Kansas congressmen, John Davis and Jerry Simp son, with an appreciative biographical Sketch of each. Two prominent Kansas politicians were talking yesterday. "Do j'oti know of a man named "Yoodles" in this state?" asked one. "No, I don't," said tho other, "has he beeu mentioned for the senate?"

Emporm Republican. COMPULSORY VOTING. The Boston Herald thinks "it is re markablo that tho first place where it is seriously proposed to undertake the ex periment of compulsory voting should be under other than a lepublican form of government." The place where this experiment is to bo tried is tho province of Quebec, a measure leing discussed in its legislative council providing that every person whose name is upon tho voting list must voto at the poll where his name is regis tered, at every election for member of the legislative assembly. Failing to do so, his name is sttuck from tho list, but the voter may be reinstated by paying n fine of ?25. It is not so remarkable that such an experiment should be tried first in a republican form of government, for in the United States, for instance, there are as many if not more people who consider suffrage a right and privilege, which like other rights and privileges, they may exort or not as they feel disposed, as thero are of those who consider this right also a duty which every one must perform. This duty is, in most instances, a mere party obligation, and it is doubt ful if there are enough professional poli ticians in the country to make it consti tutional to compel people to take an in terest in every party fight, or else pay $2o to voto when they are interested in some momentous question.

Baptists havo not altogether forgotten the hardships which they in an early day endured in consequence of an established religion, or quite renounced their first principles declaring for religious free dom and total separation of church and state. In the Canadian Baptist of No vember 13, 1S00, occurs the following editorial note: "The Presbyterian synod for New York recently s?nt a deputation to the New York State Baptist Pastors' conference, which met in connection with the state convention In Lockport, asking their aid in an effort to secure the compulsory teaching of the essential doctrines of the Christian relicion and morals in the pub lic schools. The Pastors' conference, by a rising vot, adopted a report declining " to accede to the request, and declaring that the state should have nothing to do with the teaching of religions doctrines. A Baptist conference coukl have mde no other reply " If church and stale are to b kept; separate in this country, and religious j freedom is to be onjqyed as the found- out, but they are asking for moie.
