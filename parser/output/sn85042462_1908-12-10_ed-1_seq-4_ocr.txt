On the whole, there is no body of public servants who do as valuable work, nor whose moneyed re ward is so inadequate compared to their work. Beginning with the supreme court the Judges should have their salaries doubled. It is not befit ting the dignity of the nation that its most honored public servants should be paid sums so small compared to what they would earn in private life that the performance of public service by them implies an exceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice." . Every citizen should give ungrudg ing assent to the president's recom mendation, inasmuch as it may tend to bring about a recognition of the gen eral question of salaries in relation to public servioe throughout the country. A salaried man is a person who prac tically sells his life to his employer, who la entitled to make from it as much profit as possible. As a rule, salaried men, in public office or out of it, have no definite means of knowing whether their salary bears a true rela tion to the enterprise with which they are connected. It is all guess work with them, and most of them learn to ba contented with their pay, knowing that under the law of competition there are plenty of men willing or able to fill their places. . But in all kinds of governmental po sitions the proposition is different, and we are tempted to include in the term "governmental positions" those .of school teachers, and even ministers, because of a certain constant relation of pacification and soothing which they hold with regard to the frets and wor ries and discontentments caused by the operation of our happy go lucky social system. Now, governmental positions of all kinds should be paid well, not only for the sake of the workers, but for the sake of the example the government in all its branches should set to the em ployers throughout the country. If government habitually underpays its working force, it cannot be expected that private employers will by the august example be encouraged to over pay theirs. Most of the labor troubles in the United States are the results of suspicions generated in the minds of employes by employers themselves. Th se employers , "put on a poor mouth," order general reduction of ex penses—which of course include sal —and when employes fall to see , any ' corresponding reduction of either the income* or the expenditure of such employers, very naturally they are ag grieved and become possessed by the idea they are being "used," and their ■ families perhaps . are being sacrlfled, to save employers and their families from the disagreeable necessity of re ' trenching personal," domestic and social expenses, 

FINE TRIP FOR TWELVE TWELVE TEACHERS selected by the people will visit the, Alaska- Yukon-Paelflc exposition as guests of Los Angeles Herald. Three teachers will be chosen from Los Angeles city, three from the county at large outside the city, one from San Bernardino county, one,from Orange • county, one from Santa Bar bara county, one from Riverside county, one from Kern county end ope from Ventura, county. In the words of our official announcement, which will be found on another page and should be read and studied, "No opportunity has ever before been presented whereby so much pleasure and benefit may be de rived at no cost to these great workers who are shaping the destiny of the nation. Our whole public should, and doubtless will, respond to the oppor tunity to pay the debt of gratitude due i our teachers." And unless you are willing to hazard I the suggestion that these devoted ser vants of the public are adequately paid for the training, experience, learning and wisdom they bring to their work, which is the most important work in the United States, you must admit that all of us are actually indebted to the teachers. Speaking from an entirely selfish point of view, the worst feature of underpaying any profession Is that it puts the community or other hirer under lasting obligations to the em ploye. . The conditions which must be ful filled by the reader who wishes to vote are easy. Buy a copy of the paper arid vote—that's ail. And if you become a regular subscriber, thereby paying In advance for a certain number of copies, I you are entitled to a number of votes figured in proportion to the length of i time for which you become a sub- I scriber. We think The Herald has sup plied tin easy and obvious method of giving twelve teachers a health-bring ing, thoroughly enjoyable treat. As we have suggested In fqrmer articles, con test clubs might be formed, the mem bers of which would make a united effort to obtain a number of votes - which would put a candidate of their choice in the front ranks, among the fortunate twelve. UNPATRIOTIC GREED RED STAR liners Kroonland i.nil Finland have been transferrer! from American to Belgian regis ter. These vesels were built in 1902 at Philadelphia by American workmen, with American material. They are practically American vessels. Then why is the American flag discarded in favor of the Belgian? Greed, which takes its particularly rascally and atrocious form of cheap labor, Is the explanation of the change of allegiance. By flying the Belgian flag these Ameri can ships, which make i.ll their profit out of American trade, can employ for eign crews at wages much lower than those paid American sailors. During recent years a laudable effort has been made to restore the flag of 1 our country to the high seas. But the 1 companies are balking and thwarting this effort because they have found the American sailor demands good wages. That is because he is a man of high in telligence. It Is only a man of low in telligence who fails to realize the min utes, hours and days of his life he gives to another for the profit of that other constitute as much "value" as any thing produced on earth, otherwise hu man life is not valuable, the world is a farce and we are living in a vain show. The man of high intelligence grasps the fact it is his duty to society and to the world he lives in to get as much as he possibly can ln return for his life; and In our opinion to give wages which are below tho living standard Is in reality a criminal offense — species of lar ceny. When a steamship corporation or any other employer, individual or cor porate, falls to recognize this It Is time for congress to Intervene and drive the lesson- home. Congress must find some way of regulating the conduct of steamship owners. American built ships plying between American and for eign ports and depending principally on America for revenues must not be al lowed to graft on the United States. PUBLICITY OSCAR S. STRAUS, secretary of commerce and labor, in his an nual report recognizes the great value of publicity in the national life of the United States. The day is over when there can be "undesirable" pub licity as to any legitimate matter or enterprise. If publicity is undesirable the reason for the undesirability is not founded on public necessity but on pri vate cupidity or fear, in reviewing the work of the bureau of corporations Secretary Straus says the greatest ad vance toward corporate reform must come through some general system of publicity. The logical conclusion from the work of the bureau thus far points to the Imperative need of a federal construct ive system for the positive supervision of interstate corporations, having in view the primary end of securing effi cient publicity in corporation affairs. Such publicity must be of the sort that is adapted to the practical require ments of American public opinion—the frank and free sort to which Americans are accustomed by reading the higher grade dally newspapers. It cannot con tent itself with the publication of masses of tacts and figures. These alone are not fitted to form the basis of public opinion. The government must collect such figures, but to make them of any popular use it must also summarize and digest them and pre sent them to the public in the shape of brief, reliable, clear conclusions show ing Important corporate facts. The work of the bureau of corpora tions thus far has been directed to this end, and the results have demonstrated Its value. It has been shown ln many cases that the mere publication of im proper business methods led to the Im mediate abandonment of such methods. But Secretary Straus believes the scope of this work and its beneficial results could be greatly extended by the es tablishment of a federal system of su pervision of Interstate corporations. LOS ANGELES HERALD THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 10, 1908. Congress Deeply Interested in the President's Message -^^ s^ *^^ HErrT HERALD CHRISTMAS IN our news columns the purpose of The Herald's Santa Claus festivity has been- stated clearly. It is Intended to meet cases of families with out providers, or in which sickness arid hard luck have made it Impossible for the parents this year to arrange for Christmas gifts. We are not giving rise to or fostering or giving any oc casion for fostering any suspicion or any belief that there is distress In Los Angeles. This Is far from being the ( case In this best fed and generally speaking most prosperous of all cities. But because the overwhelming major ity of the population is composed of people who have plenty of everything and do not know anything about "pinching" or "scraping and saving," we think that majority should glad ly unite with us in providing a merry Christmas for the exceptions to the general rule of prosperity in Los Angeles. That there are exceptions cannot be denied, and anyone who reads the letters sent to the Santa Claus editor will be impressed by the pathos of their appeals for a share of the bounties and blessings which Santa brings to the world during the Christ mastlde. We thank all our readers who have contributed to the Christmas festivity. Some of the gifts are sums of money; others are donations of articles of food and clothing, as well- as toys, etc. All are welcomed. We do not care how small a gift is. Generosity is always big. We hope no one will refrain from giving because he thinks his gift would not be large enough to amount to any thing. We are sure The Herald's Christmas festivity will be a great success, and it will be enjoyed not only by the chil dren, but by all who have helped make the children happy. 

SAFETY OF WORKERS EVERY year there Is an appalling loss of life in the United States through industrial accidents, while men, women and children by the thousand are maimed, crippled and in jured, permanently. Enlightened and unprejudiced newspaper writers and other public teachers and pleaders who have been aware of the exlstepce of this disgraceful condition, which in large measure are remediable, are glad to find Washington is at last recogniz ing the fact that Industrial conditions will not amend themselves, and that the beneficiaries of the great Industries must be prodded up. The government also recognizes the fact that much in jury to health and great waste of val uable-life are caused by the cheap and deadly conditions with which the pro prietary classes persist in surrounding their defenseless hirelings—defenseless because they must cither work under the cruel conditions imposed by the taskmasters of the United States or starve. Washington now says officially it should be the aim of the state, wher ever possible, to force the elimination of the evil conditions imposed on wage earners by wage payers. It is probable the government will devote time and money to an investigation conducted for the purpose of discovering methods of doing away with unwholesome working conditions. When suitable methods are agreed on by government experts, stringent legislation will be adopted, so far as such legislation may be within the powers granted by the constitution, and neglect to 1 comply with the laws for the protection of the workers will be followed by the pun ishment of those responsible. And of course those "higher up" must be pun ished. It would be^absurd to throw a manager and foreman into jail and al low the directors of an offending cor poration to continue ] their work of dividend earning by ' neglecting and abusing the humanity over the social destinies of which Providence has been pleased to give them control. Low Sam was on trial for bribery yesterday In a local court. First time we ever . heard of a briber ; who was appropriately nicknamed. RAILROADS OC. BARBER, president of the Diamond Match company, has * uttered a remark which will no doubt be appreciated by the shippers of California. He has said: "There is no power on earth that can keep the railroads straight. They are and always will be the bandits of the com mercial world, and the only way in which shippers can be rid of their ex actions is to have the government guarantee a return of 4 per cent inter est on railroad investments, and then run the whole shooting match." That government .should "run the whole shooting match" has been pro posed more than once, and If the gov ernment administration and manage ment of the railroads were as good as its administration and management of the postoffice we would have the best railway service in the world. But such a radical change as that proposed would affect railroads which are man aged with an eye to the public good as well as railroads managed with an eye to private profit, and might by some be regarded as an injustice. The suggestion of Mr. Barber, how ever, shows clearly the mental attitude of shippers of many shippers—with regard to certain railroads. They have had experiences which have led them to the conclusion that as soon as indus tries are built up In any state or in any section of a state, the railroads are "after them," with the object of sharing in the results of labor, enter prise and investment. They do not quarrel with a reasonable tariff; but when they see a disposition to raise rates arbitrarily, it is only natural they should resent it, and .mould take steps to protect themselves. '■'>■ Nothing will more quickly encour age government control, and perhaps ultimate government ownership of rail roads, than exhibitions of contempt and indifference to everything except what the railroads consider "the main chance." Such an exhibition we have had with regard to local industries and local consumers, who ere affected by a proposed increase of rates which will have the result of making living more expensive in Southern California with out increasing wages or earnings. Such - an increase as that proposed is utterly unreasonable and arbitrary. It has *-o 1 relation to social economy, and is not , Justified by circumstances. A Vermont minister built up a big ' congregation and made a weak church strong and successful by using adver tising space in the newspapers. As a consequence of the minister's up-to , dateness, the congregation has been quadrupled In numbers and the church ■ building enlarged to twice its former ' size. There is not any profession, trade, ' Industry, calling or occupation except ing burglary that advertising won't • help. Having been unable to keep up in terest in the Japanese war "scare," the alarmists are engaged in trying to dis seminate the idea that there must be war between the British and German empires. We cannot think of any pos sible cause for war between the two foremost powers of Europe unless Wil liam is tired of being cartooned by the British comic weeklies. At an early date Los Angeles Bar association will be asked to consider a plan for the removal of California Judiciary from party politics. A great deal can be said In favor of a non partisan Judiciary. In . fact, in some English-speaking countries non-parti sanship is a prerequisite for judicial office. "We • want more schools" will be the Inscription on campaign buttons prepared for the school bond election. We certainly do; and for this unde niable evidence'of the growth of Los Angeles let us be truly thankful. Nationalists are on the war path in Persia. Some day the eagle of Liberty will perch on the minarets of Teheran; but let us hope it won't be followed by a flock of buzzard trusts. The State Press Reverend Phraser Reverend Dr. Robert S. Mac Arthur of New York, one of the best known Baptist ministers in the country, says that demonstrations against the Jap anese in California are made by Pacific coast hoodlums.

Roosevelt Has a Habit of Appointing Commissions 

THERE has been an Irreverent ten dency on the part of certain news papers to treat with levity the in vestigations of the commission ap pointed by President Roosevelt to look into country life and report upon Its needs, with suggestions for Its better ment. And It must be admitted that the ecommisslon Is unlikely to discover anything new or make recommenda tions not made before. Already one of the members has summed up the chief wants of the rural population as a de mand for better roads, better educa tional facilities, postal savings banks and a cheap parcels post, says the Sac ramento Bee. These are all good things, and have 1 long been agitated.. The commission I can help them along by giving them more general prominence and urging legislation in their behalf, so far as the powers of congress may extend.
