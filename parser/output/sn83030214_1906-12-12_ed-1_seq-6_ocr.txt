Of Which, I\e Qiaj >, z w ;;; ,„, )js PRESCRIBED SPORTS. There is no graver matter agitating the world to-day than the question, What is a proper col lege sport': College authorities, having solved the puzzling difficulties of the curriculum and fashioned a. course of studies which turns the student out a polished and finished intellectual product, re giving their attention to the things which form the other sides of the student's nat ure, so as to make him a well rounded man. They are trying to formulate a curriculum of sjxiris which will make him as cultured physi cally and morally us the picking of his way among the mental pastures of the university by "election" — without "divine grace" — him intellectually! Child study is bearing its fruit. The dalipers of wisdom have not meas ured the adolescent cranium in vain. The pin prick test and the fatigue machine haw caused a great searching of hearts over the results of the ancient self-confident systems of education. Play, it has been discovered, is the great teacher. Then, are not educators neglecting their opportunities if they allow play to slip out of their hands and go on unguided by su perior knowledge- of the psychological adapta bility of means to ends? Let us have the fertile and the pointer of the schoolroom presiding over Kport. Unregulated play ..ikes jack a bad boy. It is with ihe*e considerations in mind that the faculties of the universities are giving their attention to a proper curriculum of sports- < »i. viously, a college youth may be trusted to thrid the maze of the intellectual curriculum ungulded :md unrestrained except by his own appetite for knowledge. But no such election should be permitted regarding play. If the A. '.'. degree Is to stand for anything definite it mu>t signify that the bachelor has wandered fancy free over th«* fields of science, literature and art, Kipping like a butterfly the Bowers of culture on his errant way, and that he has simultaneously pur sued a course in *i»orts free from the dissipa tions and temptations of the "elective system." as stiff and definite as the old "prescribed*' classics-mathematics plan of mental training. Who shall say whether a bachelor under the present haphazard dispensation lias pursued football, or hockey, or baseball, or basketball, or tennis, or rowing, or golf; or, profiting by the elasticity of our present elective system of sports, has chosen some "soft snap,** like tiddle dewinks or mumble-tlfe-peg. and loafed his way to his degree without the real educational ad vantages that spring from n proper course of sports? Dr. Eliot, of Harvard, is a leader In this great movement for ending the elective system of sports, as he was the leader in introducing the elective system of studies. His university has not yet taken any definite action on the *l»orts curriculum, but Dr. Eliot has not hesi tated to show why rtain sporta should be ex cluded.

DAILY TRIBUNE, WEDNESDAY. DECEMBEB 12. 190*. undergraduate emotional Tennis and rowing are enough for intert«olloKiate eontosU*. Hazing will serve as n strictly intramural pastime.

When ■ youth is .bidden to drink ii Jwttle of milk or sing a souc in public his taskmasters who supply that Im portant desideratum of true sport, team work. s»h» to it Unit lie performs his stint without shuffling or evasion. In the recent rase of baa ing by which Harvard pardonably prides her s»-if on establishing a "record" the young man shovelled snow with a soupladle without tin* faintest sasgßSttoa of that cheating which spoils most sports. He took the temperature of street cars with the patient honesty worthy of a great scientist. He walked the midwinter streets of lioston In summer flannels in which there was no guile. He made his breakfast on mustard pickles served in buttermilk and raw oysters swimming In maple syrup, finishing with a si|u:i"h pie. What chance, we should like to know. was there for cheating here? He deliv ered papers and carried about a "Teddy bear." two operations extremely open and aboveboard. There is m obvious moral discipline about all this, strengthening to students overstrained by the inevitable temptations of the intellectual si.).' of eolleee life. We make bold to say that no man can have been properly hazed without being a better man. more fully equipped for life and worthier of the honorable decree of A. R WOMES 4YD SIGHT iro/?A*. All persons Interested in bettering the condi tion of wage earners will be disappointed at the decision of ihe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court by a vote of .'! to - upholding the ruling of the Court of Special Sessions in pronouncing unconstitutional the law prohibit ing the employment of women in factories and workshops between '.» p. m. and ti a. m. Phi lanthropists familiar with factory conditions have long been anxious to protect women as wen as children froir. excessive and unseasona ble labor, not only for their own sake?, but fur the sake yf the coming generation. It Is the obvious duty of the state to protect the mothers of our citizens from labor conditions either physically or morally injurious, and any narrow limitation of the police power or any extension of the theory of freedom of con tract and saeredness of property right which leaves women and children at the mercy of industrial conditions that sup their vitality is a serious menace to the nation, which should be met. If need b*\ by constitutional amend ment. This protective movement has encoun tered serious obstacles In the courts hitherto, but there is no cause for discouragement, and happily the present decision is not linal and the division of theeourt gives reasonable ground for hope that in the Court of Appeals the law will finally be sustained. Even If It is not, the effort to safeguard women in factories 6houl«l be continued. Justice Scott. In the majority opinion, con curred In by Justices Laughlln and Clark, holds that In order to sustain the reasonableness of the provision forbidding night work for women "we must find that, owing to some physical •'or nervous difference, it is more harmful for "a woman to work at night than for a man to "do mi. for concededly the clause in question "would be unconstitutional if it applied to men "as well as to women. We are not aware of "Hny such difference, and in all the discussion? "that have taken place none such have been "pointed out." We do not know In what form this case was presented and why the upholders of the law failed to point out this difference, but we think it can easily be established. Night work is no toriously less healthful than day work for both men and women. Women are unquestionably weaker than men, and it may reasonably be maintained that what Is physically harmful for men at the best is much more harmful for women. Social conditions also render it so. Women cannot safely be about at night as men can. They are subject to Insult and to unhealthful moral Influences. They cannot go to and from their work at night as comforta bly. Transportation facilities are less adequate at night than in the day, and the state cer tainly should have a right to protect Its women from the necessity of walking the streets in the night hours, or waiting about unprotected for Infrequent conveyances. Furthermore, the great body of women workers in factories are Immature, probably half of them under age. The state assumes a serious moral responsi bility when It permits Inexperienced girls with out proper guardianship to work night after night in the factories and to walk night after night through the streets unprotected and sub ject to conditions which tend to break down the conventional restraints safeguarding girls. The broken sleep, Irregular meals and artifi cial light throughout working hours are also demoralizing. Any such industrial system di rectly pr motes nervous excitement and the decay of standards of deportment of the great est value to our civilization. Justice Iloughtou and Justice Ingraham both wrote strong dissenting opinions upholding the act limiting the hours and time of day in which women may work in factories as a valid ex ercise of police power for the preservation of the public health, and not In conflict With either the state or the federal constitution. Jus tice Houghton says: Constant night work la unhealtbful for men. and more so for women. It is a matter of lfKitirrmte concern to the state that Its women shall be healthy: and it is a matter of much greater concern that Its children shall be Ktront? and grow to be Bupporting and active citi zens rather than remain weakly and ultimately become a burden upon the public. ... It swms to me that the law Is reasonable and one which the Legislature had the jiower to enact for the protection of the health of a very large class of Ltizena of the state. .lii-! ice Jngrahain declares that tLe question nic is "whether the attempted exercise of "police powers uuiy be fairly said to be for "Uk- safety, health, morals and general welfare "of the public." and he is emphatically of the belief that It may. We hope this case w 111 be carried to the Court of Appeals, and. if the decision Is not there .•<!, that step* will be taken to secure to the state the constitutional right to protect human life from the excessive exactions of the Industrial machine. It is all very well to talk aboul freedom of oontniet. but the poor women of this state who are night workers in facto tve no freedom of contract They must work as they .ire told to work, and only as the state limits the demands which may be made ujHin them can they be protected from the ne oemlty of working at unhealthful hours. 

TROUBLE /v THE SUBWAY. .'•••at Inconvenience to which passengers on !h. local transportation lines were sut>J»-c;^d on Monday was attributable to»a variety of -•■- The atmospheric conditions which made the Mn-<-i^ slippery accounted for much of it, b .t i- not easy to understand why trouble ■>n the surface and elevated lines should have continued so long after the nlm of ice which coated the rails bad melted. The most vexs delays, however, were those which oc i-uiTed .n the subway. These culminated in a blockade resulting from the collapse of a <-a r truck Just shore the !»«''th street station, which lasted Dearly or quite an hour Just after the homeward rush began. Blnce there is reason t'i expert the occurrence of accidents of that kind .it irregular intervals in the future, i,,. public interest lU-maiius I consideration of (be v how best to minimize their c., ;,..,. quencea. The immediate effect of the accumulation or trains In dose order the other night was an nverrrowdlne of the station platform sit 00th •4tr«"«'t. (inly ;i small proportion of the ppopfc who waited there had descended from th« street and wanted to go either up or down town. A much larger numU'r were passengers from the cars whose progress had been stopped. .Many of these, seeing no prospect of IsisMag their Journey j n the subwajy. forced the out to the street in order to find other means of conveyance to their homes. So great wrrr Th.^ odds with which they had to contend thai ri is r.ither " r Til '"til that no eSM was erushf I or trampled to death. The conditions at !*;th street are particularly dangerous, because a person who starts from the island platform must go down stairs before he can go up. but the narrowness of the stairwnys and the small ness of the platforms would make a Jain like that of Monday evening nt any other station lierilous. The worst obstructions encountered by tho-*»* who tried to reach the street resulted from the legitimate demand of the passengers that their fares be refunded. This being met in an un- satSsfaetory manner, popular resentment natn rnlly led to prolonged discussion and even threatened a riot. Now, the best way to n\>-rt injury and allay wrath uurier the conditions whi^h existed the other evening Is not to offer a ticket pood for a ride in the subway another day. but either to reimburse the passenger or jrive him a check which will entitle him to a ride on the nearest elevated or surface road. Inasmuch as all of the transi>ortatJon lines in Manhattan and The Bronx are controlled by :i single company, such fair treatment of the pub lic when there is a failure to fulfil the implied contract between them for a eoutlnuous ride is perfectlj feasible. The practice ii as been in vogue over in Brooklyn for years, and there is no Rood reason why It should not be adopted on this side of the Ea«t River. If the Inter borough company will not take the necessary steps to introduce the reform voluntarily, the Rapid Transit Commission may proritably con sider how best to use compulsion.

The famous leaning tower of Pisa was not origi nally planned at an Inclined position. According to the architect's idea. It was to be straight, but when the third story was reached tl?e structure began to sink at one side Seeing this, the builders de liberately adhered to the Inclining position, but diminished the slope of the upper stories so as to kpcp the centre of gravity well within the walls. This style of building was followed by other archi tects, and at Boloena.

SAGE READ IT One of the letters Which Escaped the Waste Basket. Of the thousands of letters addressed to Mrs. Russell Sage at her country home. Cedar Croft. Lawrence, Lon«? Island, since the death of Mr Sap». last July, comparatively few have gone fur ther than a bis. yawnlnsc wastebasket. after being read by a secretary: for most of them have been of the variety of begging letter with which every rich woman la fairly showered. One that did re.u-!i the eyes of Mrs. Base was a simple note enclosing the following copy of a letter written by a NVw York editor to a "Western contributor about t ... weeks before Mr. Sage died: I am very plad to "do on« of the craft a favor " The greater favor, however. Is In returning your manuscript unused an 1 advising you not to" use It: and. as it Is not real criticism to say a thine is so without going Into details as tc> the why of it. I am going to add that "Mr. Sage soliloquizes ' Is •Totten." because It is devoid of humor, not to mention the fault of beti£ blasphemous; It Is ■'un kind," very, because It ridicules wltnout justice one of the ablest and foremost financiers of th« United States, and Is partly "untrue" because it Is not wholly warranted by facts. I. like you. do not know Mr. Sage personally, and I have not seen htm since I was a broker*! boy In Wall Street years ago: but it was hla virtues then which im p reused me. not fallings, either original or grossly magnified In a newspaper office; and 'to day is not Mr. Sace a splendid, sturdy oak In the metropolitan financial world. standing erect while men who were flattered while he was ridiculed havi fallen to the ground because they were, decayed within? It has long beta popular Journalistic sport to Jeer at Mr. Sage's meagre lunches; but outside of the. fact that he, haa a right to spend his own money as he sees fit. he hi to me a shining example of wisdom In this direction: because he, through good car« of his stomach, is living to a ripe old age. while man after man of prominence in Wall Street who habitually 'unched heavily and hast ily has within my memory gone under the sod. r.v those here, who Judge- rh; ips metropolitan by rt>;\\ rather than irtifl.'.a! standards, Mrs. Sage is con sidered an uncommonly benevolent woman; hut the world rarely hears of the charity that is don** with her husband's money, so quietly does she go her way. It would He Impertinent for m» to as >ui:..' to he an apologist for Mr. Sage— th«» more so. «s I think he needs none; but I cannot say tn fewer words what your letter si tns to cull for by way of reply. This note was not only acknowledged by M- Sage, but eh* took occasion to express to the writer her great pleasure In reading the enclosure and her warm appreciation of this tribute; of a newapuper man to her husband's real worth.
