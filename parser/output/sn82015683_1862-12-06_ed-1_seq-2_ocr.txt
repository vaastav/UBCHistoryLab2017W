Hooker has no authority to break the hwordsof olHcera, er to dismiss them fixm the service. The President's message, delivered to Con gress ye-tcidav, is just the document which an Abolition President might be expected to deliver to au Abolition Congress. It proves, il anv proof were w uiling, th tt the Administration af ways intended the war to be a war lor the ntoli lt'ti of slavery. The burden of the message is, 'how slavery can be abolished." The argu ment Hiul llic re.isoi.in (il reasoning it can !e Citlifi) by which Mr. Lihtulu cutictvoralo huw thai shivery can be abolished, and that he can abolish it, are thilditu, illogical, and snperla tively weak.

Commissioner of the Land Oiliee, lo Ihe Department of the Interior: In passing from the consideration of the pie liminatv question which have arisen in connec tion with the Pacific route, the importance of which to ihe country cannot be over-estimated, it will be found that Congress has dealt with the measure with a comprehensive spirit of liberalitv, as the grant which awards to the work an amount ol live alternate ectiou per mile on eich side of said road thus concedes a licit cl 6,1m) ieres lor every mile ol its length, embracing in all some fifteen and a half million of acres. Thi meas ure. with un existing thiity thousand miles ol t railway now spreading Irom the Atlantic bevond the Mississippi, will form a great continental srs lorn, reaching front ocean to ocean, eventually inteisectiirj every political MiMivision of the United States, thereby giving impetus to domestic trade and interests, opening new field of llor and pio-jeiity within our limit-, while our wealth wili be inct eased by the i ich F.asteni trade, through our mercantile in ui.ie on the Pacific, with Ja pin and distant India.

Some of recent disco v ery are estimated as high as$2'l,(M0 jr ton. In addition to the deposits ol gold and silver, various section of the whole mineral region are rich in piecious stones, marble, gypsum, salt, tin, quick-ilver. ;.spha!tum, coal, mm, copjtT and lead, together with mineral, incdi' inal, thorm d and cold springs and sh e uns. None of these mines have bevn worked f r a greit length of time, except the placers of California, and much the larger portion of them are com pa rath ely re cent discoveries; yet. the deeper the mine is woiked, the richer is the ore or rock. Knonuous profits ate derived from ojier itions at a depth of from 150 u i feet.

At piesent. the annual yield of the Heckius metal regions in question univ be set down at $ I Of 100 ,000.
