So is the kangaroo, but he makes it mighty interesting for the rest of the animals in a race and gets there j'ust the same. The Montpelier correspondent of the Free Press says that the direc tors of the Watchman company held a meeting on Wed nesday of last week "to sec who the- would support for next governor, and could not agree, although Lieut.-Gov. U. A. Wood bury of Burlington and Carroll S. Page of Hyde Park were decidedly ahead of all others talked of." Why this susiense? Have not the Watch man directors some regard for the rest of the state who are anxiously awaiting their decision ? Col. Charles S. Forbes of the Gov ernor's staff", state manager of the Boston Journal, special correspon dent of the New York Tribune, secre tary of the republican league and secretary of the Vermont society of the Sons of the Revolution, has been appointed deputy collector of inter nal revenue for the district of New Hampshire, a territory including Maine, New Hampshire ami Ver mont.

HERA I. WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MOXE I". Whatever the reader may think of the criticism printed elsewhere on the repairs of the court house in this place, a good many will agree that the writer hits the nail a square blow when he discusses legislative and corporate extravagance. Ex cessive taxation, and the general and protracted depression of Vermont's great industry, agriculture, give emphasis to this warning cry. As a rule people are much more lavish with other people's money than with their own, and the rapid growth of extravagance in our state legislature demands immediate attention from the voters and tax-payers. NIGGARDLY. In another part of this paper is an article taken from the Bellows Falls Times which discusses intelligently the attitude of the Vermont press towards this state. It touches, by implication at least, upon one of the most niggardly traits of the com monwealth. We refer to its treat ment of the local papers. When some politician wants an office and there is no office for him, the Legisla ture creates one for his special benefit. If there is a brace or a trio of these hungry fe'iows, as is apt to be the case, then a "commission" is formed with pay from five to eight dollars a day and "found." But when a ser vice is wanted of the newspajers they are expected to do it gratis; or what is next thing to it, such a nig gardly sum as is appropriated for publishing the laws, which in the case of the Caledonian last year was the magnificent sum of 67 cents a column for solid nonpareil ! As the Caledonian has intimated more than once, it is about time that both state and national Legislatures were run hy business men on busi ness principles. The state and coun ty have been in the hands of the practical politicians long enough. The voters should bear this fact in mind when they vote for senators and representatives next fall. WHO MISREPRESENTED? Misrepresentation seems to be the chief weapon of the two or three news papers of the state who are unrecon ciled to the new school law. The Caledonian recently made "the fact that every one desiring to teach must assemble at the county seat at a cer tain time, and spend two or three da3's on expense," the subject of criticism, but, though informed of its error, it has not the grace to correct its statement. It seems to prefer that its mistatements shall stand rather than that its infallibility shall be self-impeached among its readers bv an acknowledgment of its errors. Montpelier Watchman Dec. 4. The Caledonian did not "correct its statement" for the simple reason that its statement was true. The article referred to was written for the Caledonian while this town was full of applicants desiring certificates to teach. They came from all over this county. There was no other place or opportunity offered, but on the contrary the supervisor adver tized broadly that "all persons in tending to teach in Caledonia coun ty during the winter should attend this examination." We noticed that the next Watch man "informed" the Caledonian of "its error," but knowing there was no error we thought we would spare the Watchman's feelings by letting its error of statement pass unnotie ed. Now the Watchman returns to the assault and says the Caledonian, "though informed of its error, has not the grace to correct the state ment." There may be more than one place in Washington county where teach ers examinations are held, of this we are not informed ; but in Caledonia county, where the criticism referred to was written, there was but one such place. The Caledonian will not now assert that "misrepresentation seems to be the chief weapon" of the Watchman, but having repeated its misrepresentation of the Caledonian in a most offensive way we shall now see if, in its own words, it "has the grace to correct its statement." SENATOR IlLAIR'S SARCASM. Senator Blair of New Hampshire is a republican, but he is also a tern pe ranee man. He has written a let ter to the New York Mail and Ex press since the November elections which has in it some rich sarcasm, and altogether is decidedly interest ing reading. His estimate of the morals of his own party is unique : In Iowa, New Jersey and Massa chusetts this temperance business gave the Grand Old Party no end of trouble, and it is bound to give it much more. We are just good enough to lose the rum vote and just bad enough to lose the other, and too sensible to go into the third part- and give the country bodily for half a century into the hands of the organized liquor power democra cy. Sometimes I am inclined to wish that we were either better or worse; but, then, I don't know how we can be either any faster than we are. The Lord made us and has to get along with us about as we are in all parties, and it seems to me that we ought to endure something from each other when He bears so much from us all. Therefore I think that the "keep pegging awar" policy is the right one, and so, good as I am and so much better as I am than most of the republican party, I stick by it, il luminating its pathway bv my ex ample, and giving the rest some thing to go by to keep them out of still worse mischief. I wish that all good men would stay with me. hat a power of light we might shed if we would only get together and concentrate where the people are, in stead of going off and setting up our electric lirhts behind the barn ! AT THE NATIONAL CAPITAL. Congress met Monday with a clear republican majority in both branch es, and practically for the first time in 15 years that party finds itself in sure control of all departments of the government. Congressman Reed of Maine had been nominated in the caucus Saturday for speaker and was elected Monday, receiving 166 votes to Carlisle's 154 and Amos J. Cum- mings' 1. Only three representatives were absent including Mr. Randall. The blind chaplain of the past two Congresses, Air. Milburn, was re elected by a majority of four votes after a vain attempt of the republi can leaders to whip all their men in to line for the republican candidate. Vice-President Morton presided over the Senate and the new senators from South Dakota and Washington sworn in. The President's message followed on Tuesday and our columns allow but a brief summary of it. President Harrison recommends a revision of the tariff and additions to the free list ; pensions for honorably discharged Union soldiers, now de pendent upon their own labor for a maintenance, and by disease or casu alty incapacitated from earning it ; a national bankrupt law; national grants for education. Of special interest is the president's attitude in regard to civil service re form. "It will be my pleasure, as it is my duty, to see that the law is ex ecuted with firmness and impartiali ty," sa's Air. Harrison. During the year 18S8, 2000 railroad employees were killed and 20,000 injured, Con gress should require the use of all railroads of safetyT appliances. At tention of Congress is earnestly in voked to the consideration of such measures as will secure to all our people, black as well as white, a free exercise of the right of suffrage. In regard to the surplus, he holds that the matter should have the immedi ate attention of Congress, with a view to reducing the receipts of the treasury to the needs of the govern ment as closely as may be. Secretary Proctor's scheme of encamping sol diers on the coast and practicing them in artillery- is good. River and harbor improvements should be pushed, but with discrimination against works not of public welfare. Let us protect federal officials and judges much better; vide the Terry Field case; also protect witnesses against intimidation. The crowded docket of the supreme court calls loudly for more intermediate courts. Raise the salaries of the district judges. Congress should certainly legislate concerning trusts. He recommends a marking of the boundary between our country and Canada; appropriations for mail ser vice in American steamers for South America, China and Japan; more rapid work on our newnavy ; "make the Indian a self-supporting and re sponsible citizen. School attendance should be promoted by every moral agency, and those failing should be compelled." 

NOTE AND COMMENT. The Brattleboro Phoenix denies that Col. George W. Hooker is a candidate for Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate. This means, it is hoped tha the genial Colonel will remain in Vermont. The Boston Journal of Tuesday says that deaths by the electric wire have now become so common in New York city- that the unhappy end of a poor clerk in a furnishing store who was instantly killed on Saturday night while taking a showcase from the sidewalk, receives only a few lines of notice in the local press. In some way the metallic framework of the case came into contact with an electric light wire, and the charge of electricity entered the poor fellow's arm, with fatal results. WHAT TO READ NEXT YEAR. The prospectus of the Boston Jour nal in another column will be read with interest hy the many readers of that paper in this vicinity. Its Washington news is the best in New England, its supplements are filled with interesting letters from all parts of the world and its politics, as is well known, are straight republican Scribner's masrazine has made hosts of new readers the past 3rear by its popular electrical and railroad articles and its prospectus for 1890, published on our third page, shows that its publishers have outlined a monthly banquet of choice reading It is a magazine for all, entertaining, enterprising and instructive.

NEWS OF THE WEEK. Massachusetts City Elections. Nineteen of the twentv-five cities in Massachusetts elected officers Tues day and fourteen mayors were re elected.

We do not happen to be living in Caledonia county just now, but the writer visited the countv buildings at St. Johnsbury not long ago, and we venture to speak for all the sensible men in that countv when we sa3' that this "large expenditure" was both necessary and right. The rooms devoted to the countv officers lave long been a disgrace to the county- and the repairs and improve ments should have been made long ago. Burlington Free Press. LOCAL IVOTKIKX.
