RUSSIA FACE TO FACE WITH GENERAL STRIKE SUDDEN CHANGE FOR THE WORSE AS RESULT OF BLOODSHED. First to Flow in Telegraph Strike and May Precipitate Final Struggle Be twee n the Government and the Prole tariat President of the Workmen' Council Arrested Without Warning Paper of Bla Organisation Seised. 'St. Petersburg, Saturday Evening Dec 9. Another crisis Is at hand in volving the indefinite prolongation of the strike, the probable immediate pre cipitation of 'a general strike through out Eussla and a possible final struggle between the government and the pro letariat. This "sudden change for the worse Is the result of the shedding of the first blood in the telegraph strike this after noon almost simultaneously with the action of M. Durnovo, minister of the interior, in throwing down the gauntlet to the labor organizations by arresting M. Krustaleff, president of the exeeu- " tlv& committee of the workmen's coun cil, -without warning. About 2 o'clock several companies of Cossacks clattered through the streets leading to the headquarters of the council in , Targovia street. Having barred the approaches, a force of troops and police surrounded the building, af t- . er-which secret service men rushed in and seized Krustaleff. The latter made no resistance and the affair was con ducted quickly. It was impossible for Krustaleff to conceal the papers of the organization in which the police evi dently expect to find evidence proving the ultimate object to be an armed up rising against the government. A ' disturbance in which two strike breakers were killed and a policeman and several others wounded occurred at the same hour In (front of the general postofflce. The strikers for, two days have been seeking' to persuade the vol unteer and regular carriers to refuse to work. At the door of the building to day the strikers, enraged by the refusal " of the volunteers to quit, drwew knives, whereupon a carrier attempted to de- fend himself with a revolver. Both the carrier and a companion were fatally stabbed and sank on the spot.; A squad . of policemen was stood off by the strik era and workmen who sympathized with them. Both "sides exchanged a fierce v fusillade, during which a policeman and several workmen were wounded. As the strikers were withdrawing a Cossack patrol came galloping to the rescue. One of the strikers turned and threw an imitation bomb and the Cos- sacks wheeled- in order to avoid what they presumed to be a deadly missile. The crowd managed to get into an open courtway close to the door and to es cape. The news of the arrest of Krusaleff created an ' immense sensation among the workmen. All the socialist, labor and kindred organizations are holding a 'meeting to-night at which most In flammatory speeches are being made in denunciation of the government and all-are talking of a general strike in order to save thlbeir leader. Besides Krustaleff, three other mem bers of the workmen's council were ar. rested. . ,.; A strike has begun on the following railroad lines: Kursk, Moscow, and Se- ibas topol ; Riga and Erloff ; Khrakoft and Nicolaleff; Southwestern; Samara and Slatoust; Sizran and Viasemsk

STRONGER THAN EXPECTED. Opinion of Opposition Papers on the New Cabinet. London, Dec. 11. The conservative morning papers are compelled to admit that Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has succeeded, in forming a much stronger administration than had been thought possible. t The liberal papers are full of enthusiasm and of cordial congratulations to the premier on hav ing not only ably united all sections of his party in the ministry but on having displayed great discrimination in giv ing its individual members congenial posts. They express the conviction that such a cabinet will inspire confidence both at home and abroad. The names or Herbert Henry Asquith, Sir Edward Grey and Richard Burdon Haldane alone, It Is held, will give great weight to the ministry and insure that there will be no revival of Gladstonian home rule, despite the fact that the cabinet contains a preponderance of those fav orable to home rule. The conservative organs point out that the most enthusiastic home ruler, John Morley, has ibeen sent to the In dia office, where he will have little In fluence on internal politics. The omission of Lord Rosebery is naturally the subject of much, com ment and there is considerable curiosi ty as to what attitude he will adopt when he addresses the Liberal league to-day. It is noticeable that ibis son-in-law, ithe Earl of Crowe, is in cabinet. The rapid rise of John Burns from the workshlp to the cabinet with a sal ary of $10,000 a year Is a unique feature, indicating the growing importance of the radical party, and he Is being con gratulated on all sides on winning a well deserved honor. He will be tho first labor member of the house of com mons to have attained cabinet rank. Great Lake's Harvest of Death. Chicago, Dec. 10.

Boston, Dec. 10. Harvard footbaU authorities, while interested in the pro posed changes in football rules recom mended by the rules committee at Phil adelphia yesterdayrefnsed to comment on the matter to-day. Dr. E. H. Nich ols, spokesman for the Harvard ath letic authorities, said to-night that he could n.t "make any statement at the present lime, Inasmuch as the work of the rules ttn.mlttee has not been com pleted and yesterday's action at Phila delphia, war rot final.' ': Two p-.en prominent in New England intercollegiate athletics, Dr. Paul C. Phillips, -or Amherst, and Professor Henry Wild, of Williams, who repre sent the (faculty on the athletic boards of their respective colleges, commented to-day on the proposed changes- Dr. Phillips favored the change re quiring a gain of - ten yards on three downs, 'and believed also that all offi cials should be chosen in advance of the football season. Professor Wild said: bi"The rules as proposed would, to a certain extent, Im prove the game by causing more open play and Insuring a more strict system of umpires and referees. The rules, however, providing that the side having the ball must gain ten yards on three downs of forfeit the ball to the other side, substituting ten yards for the present requirement of five, would be likely to result in an indecisive kicking game." 

MCOV CHALLENGES CORBETT. New Club In Delaware to Offer Purse of S20,0OO. New Tork, Dec 10. Kid McCoy to night sent a challenge to James 3 Corbett for a fight, the terms of which are to be arranged later, it being un derstood that a new club in Delaware formed by Tom O'Rourke will offer a purse of $20,000. In his letter to Cor bett, McCoy says he posted $5,000 with a local newspaper as a guarantee of good faith. To issue a formal chal lenge fop a prize fight is against the laws of New 'York state, so that the McCoy letter does not deal with any of the details of the proposed contest, but simply seeks correspondence on the subject. McCoy says he Is Induced to again enter the ring only because of the unsatisfactory termination o'f his former fight with Corbstt, which he admits left a cloud on this record as a pugilist, and because he believes he, is the better boxer of the two. He de clares that under no consideration will he talk of a match with any other man than Corbett. ' Corbett Would Be Great Actor. New Tork, Dec. 10. James J. Corbett, when asked to-night concerning the challenge, said: "McCoy made a great blunder in asking me to fight. I am an actor and my ambition is to become a great actor. I have a five-year con tract and I would not think of breaking It. My fighting days are over. I hate the fighting game. I made all the mon-r ey and got all the fame that was com ing to me out of prize-fighting." . Georgic Ashore. London, Dec. 11.

DETAILS OF THE ALTERATIONS PLANSED IN CHURCH CHANCEL. Effect to be Medieval Gothic Double Stone Arches Inclosing Chancel and Reredos Latter to be Carved for Ir ving and Casson by Austrian Carvers Will Contain Figures of Christ, St. Paul and Six Other Apostles, Some more detailed ideas of the ex tensive improvements that are to be made in the chancel at St. Paul's churoh, ! which was announced in this paper last week, are now available.. The work Is the gift ft a number of parish, toners of the church whose names are, by request, not! to e known for the present. The plans are in reality a .... . f . continuation and completion of the work begun several years ago in the chancel by the installation of the beau, tiful new oaken choir stalls. It is ex pected that the work will be undertak en next summer when the church can more conveniently foe vacated for a couple of months. The new reredos Is to be a master piece of oak carving. The contract for the work is in the hands of Irving & Casson of New Tork and Boston, and the work will be executed by skilled Austrian carvers. The reredos will be placed in a recess cut in the rear wall of the sanctuary and it will be exclos ed by a handsome stone arch; The re redos will contain a figure of Christ, a figure of St. Paul, the dedicatory saint of the church, and six other apostles, Above , the reredos a large stone cir cular window will be out. On each side of the reredos the paneling will be changed and replaced by, oak paneling on the style of the present choir stalls, On one side of the reredos in a recess the sedilia and credence also of oak will be placed and in a recess on the other side the bishoo's seat and the kneeling desk will be located. ; By placing these in recesses a considerable increase in space inside the communion rail is gained. The chancel back of the rail will be tiled. A new altar, much larger than the present, cut from stone will be placed under the reredos. The steps of the altar will also ba of stone. The altar and the tiling form a separatee memorial gift. Another gift is the oak commun ion rail and the oak pieces for the bap tistry, which are how being designed. The entire chancel will be enclosed by an aroh of cut stone. Behind this arch supporting the roof will be new mas sive beams carrying out the pronounc ed .medieval Gothic effect, which the entire scheme will produce. Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson of Boston and New Tork are the architects who have the contract for the improvements,

SIGNIFICANCE. Gravity of the Situation Pointed Out lu Annual Report of the Commmlssloner of Immigration Difficulty of tfce-Ca-i. forc-eiuent of the Contract Labor Law Erroneous Impression That It Was Wrung from Congress Against Its Will by the Power of . Organized Labor. Washington, Dec. 10. In presenting the annual report of the bureau of im migration, Commissioner General Sar gent refers to the magnitude and grav ity of the problem presented by the growtli of the alien population of the United States. 'These problems," he declares, "loom so largely In the pros pect of our country that may be said, without giving Just cause, to charge exaggeration, that all other questions of public economy, relating to things rather than human beings, shrink into comparative insignifi cance." In his annuel message to congress, President Roosevelt discussed the Im migration question at length, so that those features of Commissioner Sar gent's report bearing on the' class of immigrants' desired, the Inducements offered by the immigration companies to immigrants to come to America, laws to be enacted, and the attitude toward the Chinese have been substan tially covered nd made known through the press.' There are many de tails, however, which will prove of In terest.' The total alien arrivals report ed for the vear of 1.026.499 raDresents an Increase over the preceding year of 213,629, of which the continental ports of the United States . report 196,940, as compared with the arrivals thereat last year, and the Canadian , ports 13,840. At the insular ports the increase was . 2,489, although the arrivals at Porto Rico -were Kss by 94 than In 1904. There also was a large Increase in arrivals at Southern ports, while a decrease is shown for the Pacific ports, which is accounted for in some measure by the Russian-Japanese war. . .'. Of the increased arrivals above re ferred to Austria-Hungary sent 98,537 over its , quota of 1904; Russia 39,756; Italy 28,183, and the United Kingdom, 49,544. This increase from the last men tioned country, says the commissioner. is somewhat offset by .the decreas . from Germany, Switzerland and Swed en. ' Notwithstanding the increase from Italy, that country, says the commis sioner, may be - regarded as having reached the high water mark. From this showing, i Commissioner Sargent ventures the prediction that the chief: sources of future increases in immigra- , tton are those two in Europe which have the greatest resources in popula tion probably to dispense with, Russia and Autria-tHungary. "With? these facts in view," he said, it will be possible to calculate with reasonable certainty on the character of immigration, in- its greater bulk, for some years to come at least of E"u ropea immigration," Commissioner Sargent does not lose sight of the in creased number of immigrants from European Turkey, a field, . which al though practically inexhausttible, he says, is but a virgin to the activities of the transportation agent The im portance of a proper understanding of the contract labor law is dwelt upon in the report. No feature of the immigra tion law, he declares, has proved so difficult of enforcement as that-which was passed for the protection of labor in this country from unfair competi tion by aliens. The chief .obstacle in the -way of subh enforcement, he attrib utes to the erroneous impression that it Is a measure wrong from congress against? its will by the power of organ ized labor, "exacting all it could ob tain farther than seeking simple jus tice." The impression is V so " widely prevalent, he says, that it produces at least an indifference to the enforoement of the law, if not a hostile bias against it, and credits the lac making branch of the government with no worthier motive for enacting it than eelflslt fear.
