SEVAsTOPOL, Ild., Nov. 13. 1 I want to know who the first King of England was, and how he got his kingly power ? 2 The number of kings and queens since his time as the royal blood descended ? Anal The first King of all England was Egbert, of the Royal family of Wessex. On the death of Brithric he succeeded him as King of Wessex in A. D. 800. He re duced the other kingdoms and made them dependent on him in 827. 2 The number of Dane and Saxon Kings from and includ ing Egbert, was twenty-three, down to Harold Ii., in 1066. Then followed the Norman kings, four in number, to 1135; then came the Plantagenets, eight kings to 1177; then the house of Lancaster, three kings, to 1422; then the house of York, three kings, to 148:3; then the Tudors, two kings and three queens, to 1558; then the Stuarts, two kings, to 1625; then the inter- I regnum continuing to the restoration of the Stuarts in 1660, whlch continued under two kings, William and Mary, and Queen Anne, to 1702. The Stuarts were followed by the House of Hanover, five kings, and Victo ria, who is the present sovereign. AoNDON.

What is the num ber of members belonging to the order of Good Templars in the United States ? Ans.-The effects of the use of intoxica ting liquors is more noticeable in England thlAdb'inerica, espieially among the la boring classes. 2 It is .almost impossible to ascertain or to get reliable statistics.' A late commissioner of the United States Treasury reported ' that there were $1, 483,491,806 worth of liquors sold in this ouNatry per annum." How much of this was used for medical purposes and in the arts it is impossible to say. In 1870 there was made in this country $94,128,014 worth of distilled, malt and vinous liquors, and during the year we imported an amount valued at $8,688,441. England in 1873 imported 35,417,710 gallons, valued at £11, 744,184. The number of gallons of proof spirits distilled was 8,701,118 gallons. 4 The tax on manufactured liquors paid the governutiep is ipnually about $2,000,000, and the amount received for wholesale and retail dealers' licenses would amount to nearly as much more. 5. We have seen the number stated at about 400.000. DAwN, Mo., Nov. 14. 1.

The falsity of such a statement is so absolutely without the shadow of iiabtatiatthat it seems hardly necessary to refute it. The overnment has no more to do wit:8l of the President's family tha - the family of any ether empqpf ? State. The Presi dent draws lis salary like any other offi a~l, and devotes it to whatever he pleases like any other citizen. The only difference between the present administration and preceding ones is that in March, 1873, the Presi4eptsala~y w o e.ablhd. Buchan an, durlnn his Presidency, received for the four years a salary of $100,000.

NECEDAH, Wis., Nov. 14. In the daily of yesterday, T. B., of Mon ticello, Iowa asks the question: " Why is Southern Illinois called Old Egypt ?" You answer : " From its former dark and be nighted condition." While admitting that the ignorance of the people of that part of Illinois at an early day, when compared with the intelligence and education of the present time, might justify the appellation of " Egypt" as applied to them, yet the true answer is of an entirely different na ture, and may not be uninteresting to our readers. The first settlement of Americans in the present State of Illinois was made by a colony from Western Virginia in the year 1781. This colony made their location on the bottom lands on the east side of the Mississippi River, and about thirty miles below the present city of St. Louis, and hence the name of " American Bottom," which is still the local name of that section of the country. One of those colonists was Joseph Scott, who a few years subsequent, removed to the high lands some miles furth er east and made a location of what was af terward known as the ' Turkey Hill Settle ment," in the present county of St. Clair, and as a matter of necessity had to depend upon the old settlement for his supply of corn and other provisions. When starting on his trips for that purpose his usual ex pression was " I am going down into Egypt to buy corn." As the settlements entered north, the same necessity existed of de pending upon the older settlements farther south, and in time the;term "Egypt " was Aplied to all that part of the State lying ast and south of the American Bottom. The writer being a native of that part of Illinois, and the son of one of those early emigrants from Virginia, speaks from per sonal knowledge of the facts as he has heard them stated by the parties them selves.

From t'i Nler Trk Iternhl, Nov. t;.i SAx Fl..Ncis(o. Novtembter 22.-Yester day the ('hroairle and the ('cl published elaborate articles on the cession of Mexi can territory it the United States on ac count of finamncial obligations. To-day they publish addlti.u;tl rIeasoin fori the neuofia tin. The .lI ,-ti atelytti it-ises the rumor. Ev.eryvherei in financiail circwles there is nothing heard btut, " Mexico. what do you know of Mexicot'" I have met with capitalists to-day who would have sold for any price on Saturday their claims on the Mexican Government, but who cannot be approached to-day for any less than the faoe value of their paper. The citizens of the Pacitic Coast care noth ing about what intelligence comes from Washington on this subject; they feel fully assured that the States southwest of the United States must by necessity become a portion of the Union. Hence the present rumor of negotiations gains general cred ence. By the last steamer going south from here a number of speculative adventurers left for Mexico, and the next steamer will be crowded, as in 1849, by a rush of emigrants as miners. The statements of the Mexican Consul and Mexican editors here amount to noth ing with the people in this city. They are ripe and ready for filibustering if national negotiations fail. 

WASHINGTON, November 22.-There is no truth in the report fron San Francisco that a treaty has been agreed upon with Mexico for the cession of new territory to the United States, and still less truth in the report about claims for $40,000,000 being involved in the matter. The facts are in reality about as follows: The President and Cabinet will recom mend to Congress-and the subject will doubtless be mentioned in the President's Message-a treaty with Mexico for the ces sion of a portion of the northern part of Mexico, to the east and north of a line drawn from the Rio Grande and running almost straight in a northwest direction to the head of the Gulf of California, the con sideration being the abatement on our part of all claims, past and present. for damages arising out of Mexican border raids and similar troubles. The new line of our Mexican frontier would be only about 950 miles in length, against something like nearly 1,600 miles which it now is, on ac count of running up the middle of the Rio Grande. This new line, taking in as it would the Monota Mountains and moun tain passes to the southwest of tlat river, would enable us to defend the frontier with greater facility than is possible at present on the extended, sinuous and fordable course of the river.

THIRD-TERM CRUSADE How the Sunday Chronicle Puts the Case WASIIINCTON, November 21.-Forney's Senday Chronicle returns to the third-term question with an elaborate leader this morning, showing the chaotic condition of political parties and the inevitable disinte gration of Republicanism if Grant shall net be made the candidate in -1876. The tfol lowing extracts give a fair idea of its gen eral tone: "'What Napoleon I. was to the empire (;rant ito the Republican party. Military glory in both e .ses Ilm il, t',r object adorn ed by it famous, and when tl, i'p 'itics of the present are so combined as to fo)rm a St. Helena for Grant, just so slure will the Republican party be buried by the allies to save it. It was the creation of military glory-its first victory grew ,ouit of antag onism which made war necessary to save the government from trcason-and it must. continue to find e ital force for victory at the ballot-box in the prestig., it won on the battle-field, or 1-lrisii ingloriously in the weak hands of civilian manipulators. * * * Great necessities like those which now surround the republic and the Repub lican party compel the people to look be yondl the present far into the future, and it is this influence which now guides the Re publican masses on this question. It is not the man. but the times, the epoch, which we discuss. And yet, when a man can so stamp himself upon an age. when he can so engraft himself on a nationality as to become the glory of the one and the vital force of the other, we are bound to accept him, or suffer from the chaos of uncrystal ized political opinion. The country was never so barren in ideas as it is now, never so ploughed with failures in the shape of sham statesmen, trd therefore it clings to the common sense and military glory em bodied in Grant. " * Neither the Democratic nor the Republican party can present a man at the present time who combines the same elements of strength which are embodied in the silent man of the White House. His lrsounal prestige vi talizes the party whi lih he now heads, and the Demnor::tic party appreciates this more keenly tha:I tim: It,1ublican when they burl all their !,orce in their effiorts to break him down.. -Froiu three to four hudmied million paper coll-us are maec and sold annually.
