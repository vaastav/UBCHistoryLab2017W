Opposite Custom House j 4 S k 55 THE PRESIDENTS I MESSAGE ON PORTORICO Continued from First Page prIme crop coffee lias not shared this prosperity It has never recov ered from the disaster of the hurri cane and moreover the benefits of I throwing open our market to it has t compensated for the loss inflict ed by the closing of the markets to it abroad I call your attention to the accompanying memorial on this sub ject of the Board of Trade of San Juan antI I earnestly hope that some measure will be taken for the bene fit of the excellent and high grade Por to Rican coffee In addition to delegations from the Board of Trade and Chamber of Cora morce of San Juan I also received delegations from the Porto Rican Fed eration of Labor and from the Coffee Growers Association Asks for Citizenship There is a matter to which I wish i to call your special attention and that is the desirability of conferring full I American citizenship upon the people of Porto Rico I most earnestly hope that this will bo done I can not see how any harm can possibly result from I it and it seems to me a matter of right and justice to the people of Porto Rico They are loyal they aro glad to be under our flag they are making rapid progress along the path cf orderly liberty Surely we should show our appreciation them our pride in what they have done and our pleasure in extending recognition for what has thus been done by granting them full American citizenship Un 1 der the wise administration of the I present governor and council marked progress has been made In the difficult matter of granting to the people of the island the largest measure of selfgov ernment that can with safety be given at the present time It would have been a very serious mistake to have gone any faster than we have already gone in this direction The Porto Ri I cans have complete and absolute autonomy in all their municipal gov ernments the only power over them possessed by the insular government being that of removing corrupt or Incompetent municipal officials This power has never been exercised save on the clearest proof of corruption or < of incompetence such as to jeopard izpi the interests of the people of the island and under such circumstances it has been fearlessly used to the immense benefit of the people It is not a power with which it would be 1 safe for tho sake of the island itself 3 to dispense at present The lower ci house is absolutely elective while the 1 upper house is appointive This 1 scheme is working well no injustice of any kind results from it and great benefit to the island and it should certainly not be changed at this time Election Machinery 4 The machinery of the elections is ad j ministered entirely by the Porto Rican people themselves the governor and d council keeping only such supervision w4 as is necessary in order to insure an orderly election Any protest as to I electoral frauds is settled in the courts Here again it would not be safe to nake any change in the pres ent system The elections thio year were absolutely ordoily unaccom panied by any disturbance and no protest has been made against tho management of the elcetions although three contests are threatened where the majorities were very small and er ror was claimed the contests of course to be settled in the courts In short the governor and council are cooperating with all of the most en 1 lightened and most patriotic of the people of Porto Rico In educating tho citizens of the island in the principles of orderly liberty They t are provid ing a government based upon each citizens selfrespect and the mutual respect of all citizens that is based unon a rteid observance of the prin 1 ciples of justice and honesty It has not been easy to instil into the minds of people unaccustomed io the exer J cise of freedom the two basic princi 1 flieS of our American system the principle that the majority must rule and the principle that the minority hm rights which must not bo disregarded or trampled upon Yet real progress has been made in having these princi ples accepted as elementary as the foundations of successful selfgovern ment J transmit herewith the report of the rovcrnor of Porto Rico sent to I j the President through the Secretary i of State j I j All thin insular governments should I bp placed in one bureau either in the i it Department of Var or the Department i j of State It is a mistake not FO to arrange our hornlint of these islands l at Washington ns to be abl to take advantage of the experience gained II I I in one when dealing with the prob i I lems that from time to time arise in 1I another Tn conclusion let me express my ad I miration for thp work done by the Congress when it enacted the law un t del which the island is now being ad ministered After seeing the island r I personally and after five years pxpprl I I enco in connection with its adminis I tration It is but fair to those who de vispd this law to say that it would be wellnidi impossible to have devised I any other which in the actual working would have accomplished better re sults ti
