Republican house leaders, in owlrfer ence today, considered the legislative program but without final decision. Representative Mondell, majority lead er, said appropriations must be "held down' as much as possible, and con ferences with the legislative steering committee for further discussion of more definite program for the supply bill, will be held later. The pensions bill will be first to reach the house, preparation being more or less perfunctory with the total It curries fixed by other laws. Next will come the legislative bill probably and none of the big appropriation measures is expected to be disposed of ocfore Chrtstmaa. Leaders plan to enact an army reorganization bill and a measure fixing the' permanent per sonnel of the navy before providing the funds for the services. Chairman Hood of the house appro priations committee said today the bill providing funds for the railroad ad ministration to wind up itat affairs, "would be considered soon. He expects that at least $100,000,000 would be asked of congress. 'Kill Me Quick' Is Bandit's Plea To District Attorney Republican A. P. Leased Wire) NEW 

YORK, Dec. 2. A plea to expedite his execution, which he termed his suicide, was sent to Dis trict Attorney Lewis in Brooklyn today by Gordon Fawcett Hamby, whose exploits as bank robber and tram bandit covered the United States and Canada. Hamby was convicted last June of murdering the paying teller of Brooklyn savings bank. At his trial he boasted of his exploits and pro fessed a desire to bs executed as quickly as possible. His letter to Mr. Lewis, was signed Jay Ballan, which he insists is his proper name. "I deem it," he wrote, "as much to your advantage as mine for you to ex pedite this 'suicide.' I hope that you will see fit to expedite the matter as I am dying standing up so to speak. Whether it is the menu, environment or the incarce ration I do not know, nor care, but do know thatyou would feel bad if the law wars cheated of such a willing offering. Do not let it be cheated, Mr. Lewis." PLEDGE SUPPORT TO GARFIELD DKS MOI.VES, Iowa, Dec. 2.

RUINATION'S RELATION TO OF WORLD DEMANDS PROGRAM HE AVERS Nation's Program to Restore Peace Time Business Status, Revise Tax System, Reduce Cost of Living and Rectify Labor and Farming Conditions Also Recommended. Republican Associated WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. restore a peace time business curb unrest, reduce the. cost of " farming conditions was recommended by President Wil son today in his message to the new session of congress. The president asked for new tariff laws' based on the nation's changed relation to the rest of the world, sug gested that the income and excess profits tax schedules be simplified, advocated steps to improve rural conditions and promote production, and declare for a "genuine democratization of industry" to protect both labor and . j i i t J j. lift farming conditions was recommended by President W il- capital 

WILSON'S MESSAGE TO NEW CONGRESS TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: r sincerely regret that J cannot be present at the opening of this session f th nuirri I am thus nrerented from presenting in as direct a way as N could wish the many questions that are pressing for solution at this time. Happily, I have had the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments who have kept in cloe touch with affairs In their de tail and whose thoughtful recommen dations I earnestly second. In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs growing out of federal control, I shall take the liberty at a later day of ad dressing you. Requests Budget System Legislation I hope that congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation looking to the establishment of a bud get system. That there should be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made not in dependently of each other, but with reference to one single comprehensive plan of expenditure properly related to the nation's Income, there can be no doubt. I believe the burden of prepar in? the budget must. In the nature of the case, if the work is to be properly done and responsibility concentrated instead of divided, rest upon the exec utive. The budget so prepared should be submitted to and approved or amended by a single committee of each house of coneress and no single ap propriation should be made by. the congress, except such as may have been Included in the budget prepared by the executive or. added by the par ticular committee of congress charged with the budget legislation. Another and not less important as pect of the problem Is the ascertain ment of the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated are expended. Under existing law the only audit is for the purpose of ascer taining whether expenditures have been lawfully made within the ap propriations. No one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent widely, econom ically and effectively. The auditors should be highly trained officials with peiunanent tenure in the treasury de partment, free of obligations to or mo tives of consideration for this or aay subsequent administration and author I'.ed and empowered to examine into nnd make report upon the methods employed and the result obtained by the executive departments of the gov ernment. Their reports should be made to the congress and to the sec retary of the treasury. I trust that the congress will give Its Immediate consideration to the problem of future taxation. Simplification of the Income and profits taxes has become an Im mediate necessity. These taxes per formei Indispensable service during the war. They must, however, be sim plified, not only to save the taxpayer Inconvenience and expenses, but In order that his liability may be vntrSe certain and definite. Favors Revenue Law Changes With reference to the details of the revenue law, the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of in ternal revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amend ments necessary or desirable In con nection with the administration of tlse law recommendations which have my approval and support. Tt Is of the ut most importance that In dealing with this matter the presnt law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes for the calendar year 1920. payable In the calendar year 1921, The congress might well consider whether the higher rates of Income and profits taxes can in peace times be effectively productive of revenue and whether they may not, on the contrary, be de structive of business activity and productive of waste and inefficiency. There Is a point at which in peace times high rates of Income and profits (Continued on Page Jwoi Press Leased Wire A diversified program to status, revise the tax system, living and rectify labor and 0 . Evades Treaty and Mexican Issues The railroad problem he reserved for a future message and he made no statement of his Intentions regarding the peace treaty or Mexico. Many of his resolutions Were the same as those submitted to the special session last spring and several of them are embraced in legislation al ready being formulated in the two houses. To meet the cost of living, the presi dent asked extension of the war time food control bill, federal regulation of cold storage, readjustment of food transportation and establishment of a system of federal licensing for all cor porations engaged in interstate com merce. He declared the causes of unrest to be superficial and temporary and made his only reference to the senate's fail ure to ratify the peace treaty in Bay ing that restlessness was due largely to the nation's hesitation in determin ing Its peace policy. The federal gov ernment, he declared, should be armed with full authority to deal In the crim inal courts with those who promote violence. Should Recognize Labor's Rights In an extended discunsion nf idKai. conditions, he declared the workers had i just cause for complaint in many mat-! ters, and that there should be a. "full j recognition of the right of those who in wuaiever rana, to participate in some organic way in every decision that directly affects their welfare."- He asserted that the right of Indi viduals to strike must be held inviolate, but added that there must be a firm stand against "the attempt of any class to usurp a power that only government itself has a right to exercise as a pro tection to all. Finally he suggested the establish ment of a tribunal for peaceful decision of Industrial disputes. Saya Budget System Needed He renewed his recommendation for a budget system of national finances, asked for special protection to promote the dye-stuffs and chemical industries and declared the administration bill providing farms for soldiers should be passed without delay. The message, about 5,000 words In length, was transmitted to the o,ifri by messenger, the president expressing regret that his health would not per mit his delivery of it in person. It was read separately in senate and house where it drew mixed expressions of approbation and disappointment. The democrats generally praised it as setting forth decisively a practical pro gram of reform, while on the repub lican side there were many complaints that it lacked definiteness and omitted mention of important problems. o Violators Of Coal Strike Injunction To Be Prosecuted Republican A. P. Leased Wire 

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Dec. 2. Con vinced that efforts to bring about a resumption of operation of coal mines through offers of 14 per cent wage advance to miners have failed - and that the injunction issued by United , Slates District Judge Anderson ! against the strike has been violated, the government has concluded to in stitute contempt proceedings at once, it was indicated tonlgnt. Federal agents would .make no statements as to when court action might be expected but it is known that evidence has been collected against alleged violators of the In junction and in well informed circles it was confidently expected that ar rests would be made within 48 hours. It is understood that the government has delayed taking action in the hope that some other way out of the fuel difficulty would be found. The injunction, as explained by Judge Anderson, extends to individual miners, operators or other persons who in any way encourage the strike or interference with production of coal. . Government attorneys, it Is said, interprets this to mean that any statement made by miners, or any agreement between two Or more men to continue on strike, constitutes a violation of the injunction. S.D. REPUBLICANS FAVOR GEN. WOOD FOR PRFSUf Gov. Lovden of Illinois Only Other Serious Con tender Democrats Pledge Support to Wilson If He Runs for Third Term Republican A. P. Leased Wire PIERRE. S. D.. Dec. 2. Major Gen eral Leonard Wood was indorsed for president of the t'nited States early tonight by the republican state conven tion after a spirited struggle In which Governor Frank O. Ijjwden of Illinois came out second best. While the re publicans were meeting in one legis lative chamber of the state capitol. the democratic state convention in the op posite chamber indorsed President Wil son for a third term by an unanimous vote. Under the Richards state primary lay, the country delegations cast their vote on the basis of their voting strength at the last state election and a majority was necessary to Indorse or nominate. Wood received 29,599 votes from the republican mapority and Low den got 15.442. The necessary majority was 25,558. the republican convention was turned into a turbulent session late to day, when one faction halted a roll eall on presidential indorsement and urged that the county delegations withold their vote on that question. After this move was defeated, the supporters of this plan who were classed aa anti Wood delegates, swung their strength to Lowden. The republicans then quickly in dorsed Governor Calvin Coolldge of Massachusetts for the vice -presidential nomination. Coolidge received a heavy majority. A few scattering votes were cast for Theodore Roosevelt, Senator Hiram Johnson and Henry Alien of Kansas. The democrats indorsed Vice President Marshall for a third term if he is -candidate." Governor Peter Norbeck was nomi nated for United States senator by the republican party to oppose Senator Ed S. Johnson, who was renominated by the democrats. Both conventions then took up the work of nominating con gressional and state tickets. The only other presidential possi bility mentioned at the democratic convention was William G. McAdoo. After President Wilson was indorsed a delegate moved that the convention in dorse McAdoo in the event that Presi dent Wilson decides not to bo a candi date. The motion was ruled out of order. The democrats spent most of the aft- ernoon discussing their platform and particularly the labor plank. The Re- publicans adopted their platform in the forenoon. The keynote of the demo cratic platform was permanent peace under the league of nations. The para mount Issue of the republican resolu tions was Americanism. Both parties indorsed the league of nations. The democrats unreservedly indorsed President Wilson and his ad ministration and the league of nations covenant without amendments or res ervations. The republicans condemned the administration but indorsed the covenant without amendments but with reservations which "will tend to safeguard the integrity of the nation and preserve the Monroe dictrine." 

FIRSTTMALSHIPPEO II L F Republican A. P. Leased Wire PITTSBURG, Kans., Dec. 2. Kan sas got a toe hold in the coal mining business today. Toward storm-swept southwest Kansas, where the mercury is hover ing a few degrees above zero, is speeding tonight the first car of coal mined by ' volunteer workers in the strip pits of the Pittsburg field. It was billed out of Pittsburg this aft ernoon to the mayor of Coldwater, Kans., and was expected to be fol lowed tonight by other, cars destined for sections where the coal famine is most acute. The dirt walls of the pits were frozen solid and at the bottom were treacherous reaches of ice and ice covered pools of water. It was a day that ordinarily would have brought a halt to mining operations. The first contingent of volunteer miners, which arrived yesterday, was augmented- today by the arrival of 600, additional men. Officials announced they would be put to work tomorrow. O. S. Hubert, general manager of op erations, said he expected to have a majority of the steam shovels in the district working full time tomorrow or Thursday. Distribution of the coal mined in the strip pits by the volunteers will be made through the mayors of the Ta rious Kansas towns and cities where the coal is sent. Governor Henry J. Allen announced today. Kansas guardsmen continued- to guard the strip pits today while the federal troops remained ennamped on the grounds of the state normal school here. - , Among the volunteers who reached Pittsburg today are business men, clerks and callers stiadpafiv UNDER S ATEM 1 KANSAS 1 CONTRAST ACTION ON ENGLISH DEMAND TO JENKINS CASE DELAY Mexico Speedily Effects Release of Kidnapped British Subject Argue on Release of Consul Republican A. P. Leased Wire WASHINGTON. Dec. 2 With much impatience the state department today awaited word from Mexico City of the release of Consular Agent Jenkins in the penitentiary at Puebla in response to this government's second sharp note to Carranza, The department to night had not been advised of the note's delivery, but officials said it probably was presented during the day and that they expected prompt action by the Carranza administration in ac ceding to the "request" of the United States. The note was forwarded early Sunday and a delayed dispatch from the Mexican capital said the Mexican foreign office announced late last night that It had not been re ceived. Errors In caole transmission were said to have delayed its presen tation. England Gets Quick Action A new sidelight on the general Mex ican kidnaping situation was given to day in a report of the capture of Nor man Rowe, a British subject, by rebels at Zacatecas. who held him for ran som, but who quickly released him at the Instance of the Carranza admin istration, without payment of ransom. Great Britain never recognized the Carranza regime in Mexico. The British vice consul at Zacatecas promptly notified the Mexican authori ties and reported the kidnaping to the British consulate general at Mexico City. Representations were quickly made to the Mexican government and within a few hours the machinery, including the military, was seeking rescue of Rowe. The kidnaping took place at Fresnlllo, a large mining camp at Zacatecas, and In reporting ,the liber ation and return of Rowe to Fresnillo the vice consul said: "The government troops and the state authorities exercised alt dili gence in effecting the liberty of Rowe and as a mere matter of justice this should he stated as everything is due to the efficiency with which the au thorities mored in the matter." Cabrera Active in Prosecution Luis Cabrera, secretary of the treasury under Carranza, known to be bitterly anti-American and whose brother Is governor of the state of Puebla, where the Jenkins kidnaping took place, has taken an active part in the Mexican government's prosecution of the case against Jenkins, according to advices received today. In a state ment prepared for the press of Mexico City. Cabrera said that Jenkins might be liberated on bona, but that the American government "now prefers to set him free by means of threats." "It is inexplicable," Cabrera was quoted as saying, "that the American, government should have requested the immediate release of Jenkins even be fore the court decision was rendered. The United States government is seek ing to have Jenkins declared innocent even before the investigations of the case are completed. And if the insin uations of another government in purely administrative matters can not be accepted, how can foreign imposi tion be permitted to hurry a final sen tence in a case which is of the exclu sive jurisdiction of the courts?" Says United Verde Extension May Be Forced to Suspend Republican A. P. Leased Wire DOUGLAS, Ariz, Dec. 2. James S. Douglas, president of the United Verde Extension Min ing company at Jerome, Ariz., left here tonight for Jerome to try to arrange for sufficient coal to carry the company smelter over until an oil-burining system can bs installed under the 'boilers. Un less ha can arrange for a coal sup ply the smelters and later mine ' must close down, affecting large numbers of employee, he said. The United Verde Extension company obtained its ooal supply from mines at Gallup, N. M which are not producing at present. There is only sufficient coal on hand to last until the end of this week, Mr. Douglas said. o SAY

P. Leased Wire CHICAGO, Dec. 2 The coal short age today drew tighter the restrictions of coal consumption with additional closing of schools and industries and reduction in hours of business in many regions. There was little change at the mines. Subzero weather in 10 states and slightly less severe cold in much of the central portion of the country com bined with the reduced coal supplies to urge officials and citizens generally to action. Union officials in Wyo ming ordered the strikers who walked out yesterday to return to work, al though in Montana the miners ob served their decision to refuse to re turn to work. The southwest regional coal commit tee ordered hours of all retail stores, except drug stores, reduced to from 1 I) a. m. to 5 p. m. Schools were closed at Cheyenne, Wyo., and Springfield, III. The Southern Illinois Light and Power company gave notice that power would be withdrawn from non-essential industries and institutions in 11 towns.

About 12,000 men, would be made idle,., , Mining coal with volunteer diggers in the Kansas surface mines, begun yesterday, went ahead rapidly today and the first car of coal was shipped to the mayor of Coldwater In western Kansas, where a coal famine has ex isted for days.

Frank Farrington. president of the Illinois miners' district organization, said he would seek a conference with Governor Iowden tomorrow, but in timated a strike of anthracite members might be called to aid the bituminous coal diggers. Serious stoppage of industries and : all forms of business, frith closing of theaters, schools and churches, gen erally was predicted for many cities at the end of the week. Regional coal of ficials said about 8000 plant employ ing 300,000 men in the Chicago district and more than 1,000,000 in the north western region, probably would be shut down as a result of restricting coal deliveries to the most essential industries. In Chicago a meeting of representa tives of 350 amusement, houses dis closed today that theamusement enter prises had a supply to last 30 days or more. More drastic restrictions for Chi cago are planned to be promulgated tomorrow by the council of presidents of local business organizations at whose preliminary meeting tculay de cisive action was urged to effect a re turn to production at the mines. o E T Republican A.
