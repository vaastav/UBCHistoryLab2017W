"Our friend Uryan" of the Montgom ery Standard increases in modesty as "age creeps on apace," and has just found out bow brassy it looks to repro duce tbo complimentary notices of ex changes. Ho was brought to this sad state of feeling in his idle peregrinations over tho state last summer, whan bo cciveJ a blow from all tho unfortunate editors into whose sanctum ho called for a friendly visit and a notice, which made him "feel like a wandering mo bugerio or nomadic monkey show."

He made a great reputation by his speeches in the lust gubernatorial canvass, and bis oppo atnt, Caldwell, after one trial, was afraid to seel him again on the stump.

The annual mcssago of the Frosidoiit to Congress at its recent assembling, Is longer and probably an abler docutnont than his former ones ; but bo does nol as was seme lime since intimated he would, recommend general amnesty, nor docs he ask for the repeal of the Ku klux laws. In place of publisliitij? (he mes sage, which would taka up nearly all our space, we copy tho following compre hensive summary from (he Missouri Ro publican Tbt present message of President Grant is a very marked improvement on its predecessors ; tbo subject mutter is placed in an orderly arrangement under different beads, tho treatment ol llicso heads is clear and vigorous, and tlicro aro none of thoso raw expressions that marked one or two of his preceding cexmumcations. Ibo wholo document is crata, decorous and well-considered both in its ideas and its word, as a prcs idential message should bo. It opons with an expression of thank fulnoss to I'rovidenco for a year of blesv mgs and prosperity unbroken by any notable calamity except tho lire that re ccntly devastated tho city of Iloston. The results of the Geneva arbitration is claimed as "entirely satisfactory to ti c government, and in accordance with the views and tho policy which it main tained." This result, as has alrcadv been stated, is the award of the sum of 15,000,000 in gold to the United States as indemnity for the neirlcct of Great llritatti in tho matter of the privateers The president congratulates cultures on the peaceful and satisfactory character of the tribunal s deliberations, and pavs a wall deserved compliment to the Ameri can arbitrator, Charles Francis Adatiw, and to tho gentlemen who acted as agent and eounsci for our govcrtuctit in the augnst conclave. He recommends the creation ef a board of commissioners to apportion the indemnity to thore to whom it may be due. He refers in terms of beenming dignity and acknowl edgement to Kmpcror William's decision in favor of the 1 1 aro channel as the true northwest boundary line, and awards to Mr. Hancroft, our minister to lierlin, the credit for the preparation and prcsenta tioa of tho case. 1 is stated that, al though this decision is not required lo take efftct for twelve months, her lint anr.it Majesty has ordered her troops to ?racuato. 1,10 is,anJ of .San J,".a,1 UU.J h IB HUD III UUI IUIt30IUUt I U titUlU u Wlfi1lllF linn lull ft 1. t-.it tat I r irin onmu quartor, tlio message recomuiunitj tliu appointment ot a commission to act jointly with out appointed by the British, to mark the line between Alaska and the British possessions. He ttdvisoi con cressional action to execute the provis ions ef thu Washington treaty ou ihe subject of fisheries, and also an increase of the force now engaged in making the boundary lino from Lake of thu Woods to the Uocky Mountains. Our friendly relations with Franco, Russia and Germany form tlio subjest of one of the most pleasant paragraphs in the message ; and the suggestion is mado that congress invito thu international sta tistical congress to hold its next session in this country, at the time of tbo Cen tennial celebration in 1870. Tho president refers to tho Vienna exposition in 1873, and advises an appro priation to oil American inventors and manufacturers to exhibit their produc tions there, and also advises that the sec retary of the navy be authorized to fit up two naval vessels to transport to Trieste articles for exhibition. Our relations with Mexico do not provoke any significant refcrcuco ; the allusion is merely formal. On the rub- ject ' UD3. 'ho mtsiaae shows more "i'erost. Ihe president attributes the enntinuanco of the robellion there to the cxistenco of slavery, repeats his former rcrnmratudation of measures to prohibit American citizens Irom holding slaves on the island, and hopes the present liberal government of Spain will take stops to abolish slavery and introduce reforms into the island. He repeats his recom mendation of an appropriation for tho education of four American youths in Japan and tho samo number in China, for the purpose of faciliating and strength cning our diplomatic intercourse. The receiptD of revenue for the year ending June 30, 1872, were 8374,100, S.'i", and the expenditures for the samo period were $270,559,G95, The reduc tion of tho public debt for tho year was 99,0G0,253. The total reduction of the debt for the three yoars and eitht months ending Nov. 1, 1872, is ?3fi3.G90.9)9. Tho president thinks any further rcduo tion of taxation would be unadvisablo, and ho therefore recommends that legis lation on this subject be limited to a mcro correction of errors in the present system of taxes. Ho thinks the mainte nance of our crodit dictates this course, as ho seems to fear that a further reduc tion may leavo us without means to do fray the expenses of tho government, pay tho interest on the debt, and provide for the einkint: fund. The expenses of the war department for tho last fiscal year worn 35.799,991, boing a decreaso of 427,831 from the preceding year. The estimates for this department for tho vear ending Juno 30, 1371, ro 33,801, 378. Tho president invites tho favorable consideration of tho Georgia canal schema, and tho James river and Ka nahwa canal scheme, and, while not actually recommending them for appro priations advises tho appointment of i congressional romnuttoo tn report upon them. Ho alludes to the post-office reports, recommends a modification of the tranking privilege and advises tho ap pointmcnt of a committee or eommis sion to devise some equitable method for purchasing the telegraph linos and con necting them with tho postal service, The president refers tn the Ku-klux laws, regrets tht necessity for them, but avows his purpose to enforco them with rigor when occasion requires it, and makes no recommendation of a repeal of ttiom. U icavowti u India policy, and thinks it "bos bn as successful as ib most ardent fricndi anticipated within nojhorlk time." Ho speaks favorably of tho orgauizatlon of tho Indian terri tory into a regular torritory, care bsing taken, howovcr, to protect tho Indians from tho inroads of white men until they shall ho sufficiently advanced (o protect themselves. The message refers with somo minute nets lo tbo report cf tho patent office, the department of justice, and thoagricultural bureau. It approves tho hill now pend inc in congress for appropriating part of the proceeds of public lands to education in tho states. Civil service reform is reserved for mention ot the close of tho message. Tho president repeats his earnest dtsira to reform tho abuses in the service, and to prevent the offices of tho government from being regarded us rewards for pulitical strvices. He prom ises lo apply the rules on this subject already devised, and asks congress to tniko the system binding en his succes sors. On tho whole, tbt president's commu nication to congress is an able, practical and exhaustive ttate paper, and it will attract very general interest and com mendation.

What became of the roustabout is not known. The womea had, no doubt, drunk thtmstlvts into a state of helpless intoxication, and when the building took fire were unable to escape. The fire is supposed to have bten started by the wood work around tho stove igniting, at the building en a previous occasion caught fire in tbat way. St. Charles News.

About two weeks ago, James Ivilkellen, who lives ou ueutord strttt, abovo Uratf, in tho eleventh ward, and who is carter by ao- c'jpatios, had a herst which was taken sick with the epizootic. Tot greatest care was bestowed upon tbo animal bv James, and he daily rubbed the horse down and administered sueh remedies a be could procure. About a week auo. while currying off the animal, some of the virus from tho horse's nostrils was thrown upon his sore hind, and a day or so tiler it began to swell, the inflamma tion gradually extending to the arm, and increasing until last evening, the area of the unfortunate man was about the size of an ordinary man's leg.
