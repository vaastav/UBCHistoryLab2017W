To the "People of Michigan: The burden of carrying to a suc cessful conclusion the great task of selecting and mobilizing Michigan's j quota of the first contingent of the National Army has. heretofore rested upon the shoulders of a, comparative ly few, citizens of the State. Mem bers of Local and District Boards have freely giveri their time and work i in many cases entiling great, personal sacrifice. , We are now called upon to make a complete inventory and clas sification of all registrants who have not already been selected for service. This work is to be completed within a period of sixty days. To accom plish this successfully requires the whole-hearted support and coopera tion of every American. I, therefore, as Governor of Michi-( ran. do hereby appeal to all citizens. I of Michigan to answer the call of the President of the United States, and" to assist Local and District Boards : by proffering such . service and such material conveniences as they can of-' fer, and by appearing before the boards to give such information as will be useful in classifying regis trants. I especially urge school, teachers and others of clerical ability , to at once report to local board? to, 'i.''' 1 '1. - I assist ui vne-wurii o. preparing ques tionnaires. , i": Men of the legal profession should offer, themselves as associate, mem- J bers of the Legal Advisory Boards to be provided Ineach community for' their rights and obligations and of ns-) sisting them in ' the prepo ration of their, answers to the questions which all ment subject to draft arc required tb Submit.

Russian traitors now in control of the government have arranged a ten-day armistice with Germany in an attempt to arrange peace terms. It is reported Kerensky is safe and as many of the people of Russia are' starving it is believed the new government by the anarchists will be overthrown aod Russia agaiu will organize to fight for its existence on the side of the Allies. Why the Delay in Delivering Liberty ' ' Bonds. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chi cago, through which all Liberty bonda for Michigan purchasers come, explains the reason for the non delivery as fol lows: r "In view of the large number of pay ments entered on our booka aa of Nov, 15,017, It is impracticable in this case to1 follow our rule of first come first served, wltt. respect to deliveries. We have, therefore, determined to sort tbe allotment letters alphabetically by cities.- Deliveries of bonds, for which full payment was received Nov. 15, will be made in the order indicated. Under this arrangement shipment will be made to all of the banks, in any given city on tbe same day. "In pplte of the efforts of the Treas ury Department and the . Bureau of Eo graving and Printing at Washington to keep pace with the demands for bonds, they have so far been able to fill only a limited proportion of our requi sitions. It is, therefore, impossible for us to indicate definite dates for deli V; eries in individual cases."
