SHAW, Manchester Center, - Telephone 12-3 Vt Manchester Center, Vt Health, Accident, Life, Fire, Automobile, Liability. REAL ESTATE Manchester Center, Vermont PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE (Continued from Page 2) - to write upon, ("ertufiily the govern ment of the Dtjlted States la not think that It Is generally agreed that there should be a H.vstcmntle reorganl eatiou and reassembling of lta parts so as to secure greater efficiency and effect considerable Barings In expense. But tbe-amonnt of money saved In that way would. I believe, though no doubt considerable In itself, running, it may be. Into the millions, be relatively mall amall, I mean. In proportion to the total necessary outlays of the gov ernment It would be thoroughly worth effecting, as every saving would, great or small. Our duty U not altered by the scale of the saving. Hut my point is that the people of the United States do not wish to curtail the activities of this government They wish, rather, to en large them, and" with every enlarge ment with the mere growth, indeed. r the country Itself, there must come, ot course, the inevitable Increase of ei- pense. The sort of economy we ought to practice may be effected, and ought to be effected, by a careful study and aaaesement of the tasks to be per formed, and the money spent ought to be made to yield the best possible re turns in efficiency and achievement 

PRESIDENT OPPOSED TO BIG STANDING ARMY. Speaks Plainly and Directly en Quti tion of National Defenses. The other topic I tuke leave to mention goes deeM.-r Into the prill clplin of our mitioiiiil life and ixtllcy it la the subject of uatloDul defense. it cannot be dlscucd without tirst Uuanerlug some very seurculug ipies- tloua. It Ih suld In some quarters Unit we ure not prepared for war. What Is meant by being prepared? Is Ittiieiml that we are not ready upon brief m- lice to put a nutiou In the fleld. a nn tiou of men trained to aruisy Of couree we are not ready to do that and we ahull never be in time of peace so loug u we retain our present pollt leal principles and Institutions. And what la It lliat It la suggested we should be prepared to do to defend ourselves against attack? We have nl ways found means to do that and shall find them whenever it Is necei s&ry without culling our people awuy from their necessary tasks to render compulsory military service In times of H?ace. Allow me to speak with great plain ness and directness upon this great matter and to avow my convictions with deep earnestness. I have tried to kuow what America is, what her people think, what they are, what they most cherish and bold dear. I hope that some of their liner passions are In my own heart some of the great con ceptions and desires which gave birth to this government and which have made the voice of this people a voice of peace and hope and liberty among the peoples of the world, and that. speaking mv own thoughts, I ahull, nt least In pint, speak theirs also, how ever faintly and Inadequately, upon this vital mutter. We are ai peace with all the world. No one who speaks counsel based on fact or drawn from a Just and candid interpretation of realities can say thai there Is reason to fear that from any quarter our Independence or the integ rity of our territory Is threatened Dread of the power of any other na tion we are incapable of. We are not jealous of rivalry In the fields of com merce or of any other peaceful achieve ment We mean to live our own lives, as we will, but we mean also to let live. We are. Indeed, a true friend to all the nations of the world, because we threaten none, covet the posses-j sioiis of none, desire the overthrow of none. Our friendship can be accepted and la accepted without reservaiion, be cause It is offered In a spirit and for a purpose which no one need ever .question or auspect Therein lies our greatness. We are the champions of peace and of concord. And we should be very jealous of this distinction which we have sought to earn. Just now we should be particularly jealous of it. because It Is our dearest present hope that tills character and reputation may presently. In God's providence, bring us an opportunity sucb as has seldom been vouchsafed any nation, the opportunity to counsel and obtain peace in the world and reconciliation and a beating settlement of many a matter that has cooled and interrupt ed the friendship of nations. This Is the time above all others when we should wish and resolve to keep our strength by self possession, our Influ ence by preserving our ancient princi ples of action. Prom the first we have bad a clear and settled policy with regard to mili tary establishment". We never have had, and while we retain our present principles and ideals we never shall have, a large standing army. If asked. Are you ready to defend yourselves? we reply. Most assuredly; to the ut most And yet we filial! not turn America into a military camp. We will not ask our young men to spend the best years of their lives making soldiers of themselves. There la an other sort of energy In ns. It will know bow to declare itself and make Itself effective should occasion arise And especially when half the world is on fire we Khali be careful to make our moral Insurance against tbe spread of the conflagration very definite and cer tain and adequate indeed. Let us remind ourselves, therefore. of the only thing we can do or will do. We must depend in every time of na tional peril. In the future as In tbe not upon a standing army nor yet upon a reserve army, but upon a olti- eenry trained and accustomed to arms. It will be right enough, right American policy, based upon our accustomed principles and practices, to provide a system by which every citizen who will volunteer for the training may be made familiar with tbe use of modern arms, the rudiments of drill and ma neuver and the maintenance and sani tation of camps. We should encourage sucb training and make It a means of discipline which our young men will learn to value.
