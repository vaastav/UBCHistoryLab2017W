SERMONETTE. ' The wrath of an unreasoning and unreasonable king became the opportunity of revealing the power and glory of. the true God. How often It has been true In the world's history that the Daniels have been prepared to atep forth In the darkest hour snd become mighty, witnesses for God. What a testimony, too, we have here of the power of united prayer. Having ob tained from the king a stay of execution of his decree com manding all the wise men in the kingdom to be slain, Daniel seeks out his three faithful friends and urges them to spend the night In prayer, while he, also, swalts before God. What sublime faith was that which could take the young He brew before the king, and prom ise an interpretation If ho could but have time In which to wait before his God. If Daniel had not been on In timate terms of fellowship with his God and had not known the power of prayer he never would have dared to have appeared be fore the king with his seeming ly rash promise. , Is It not . because we are strangers to God that we are completely taken off our feet when the dark hour of trouble ; descends upon usT We are ! panlo stricken and discouraged, j We dare not look up because a : guilty, neglectful 'heart cannot look Its God in the face, and so ' we tremble and fall before the ; misfortune that has overtaken ; us. TroubleMs a blessing some- ; times In that It drives the wan- j derlng heart back to God, but ! how much better to keep In ' close touch with God all the time, so that when the dark- j ness overtakes us It finds yt with eyes uplifted towards the : "hills from whence cometh our help." , j Definite prayer gets definite i answer. Note that Daniel and his companions prayed for Just j one thing. Much of our prayer '. Is so diffused and scattered that t scarcely has the prayer been ut- tered but that we have forgot- ten the things we have prayed . for. ; THE STORY. U A RIOCH. the king's messenzer la a at the door, announced the serv ant or the chief of Nebuchadnezzar's astrologers, coming to the door of the apartment where his master was sit ting bowed in hopeless discourage ment. His voice shook with suppressed emotion as be spoke, and it was plain to see mat ms eyes were red and swollen with weeping. "Oh, my master," be burst out, as ms master arose, unable longer to con- u-oi ms reelings, "Must I bid thee lareweu. "Tut, tut, Arbel, thou must not give way to my feelings thus. A Wiseman knows how to die. The king bath de creed It What further need Is there ior regret! it is his will. Farewell! Tbon hast been a faithful servant" And pressing an affectionate kiss unon the cheek of the grief-stricken serv ant, tne wiseman drew bis robes about blm and with quiet, self-sustained dig nity, joined Arioch at the door. -I am ready," he said, bowing courteously. "Let the king's decree be executed' speedily. The wlsemen of Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom know bow to die." "rcome not to execute the decree," spake Arioch, rapidly.. "I coma with a message of cheer. At the request of one of the Hebrew captives named Daniel the .king has stayed the execa Iton of bis decree-ufalli the- morrow, for this young man DaaJel declares' that he will on the morrow ten tbe king bis dream and give the Interpre tation thereof ' : ' v r A revulsion of feeling swayed the chief of the wlsemen for a minute. . - "What!" be almost shrieked, "la there) still hope." "I did not say so rejoined Arioch, 71 cz:7 tzli tlxt til yctra Hefcrew bad prcolssj to give the Xlxz. answer. ' Then the ludlcrousnees of the situ tlon broke over the wiseman and he burst out into a load, derisive laugh. : "What can this despised son of Ja cob do when the wlsemen of all the kingdom have failed to meet the king's unreasonable demands? Daniel! Daniel! Who Is this Daniel who would seek to break Into the ranks of the ages of the great kingdom of Baby lon? Take ma to blm," be added, with sudden resolution. I would welcome him to the ranks of those who will fall before the sword of the king on the morrow.. Ho shall have the honor of preceding me to the execution block." Thus admonished, Arioch led , the way to the apartments In the wing of the palace set apart for the use of the Hebrew captives. Listen," cautioned Arioch. as they reached the door of the apartment and paused on tbe threshold before enter ing. "He talketh with some one with- In." . ' . wi m wait, then." the wiseman admonished, stopping short and turn ing bis ear In the direction of the voice within that he might bear what was said. me man . speaketh a Strang tongue," whispered Arioch. The wiseman nodded a yes. and ot tered the one word, "Hebrew," and continued to listen with breathless in terest, for, wiseman that be was, he was versed In all tbe learning of the nations and was quite familiar with. tne Hebrew tongue. un, Lara, my God." the wiseman heard the voice say. "Thou art the God of mercy and of judgment, the giver of wisdom and the justlfler of them who diligently seek thee. Hear thou my prayer and the prayers of thy servants, Hananiah, Mischael and Ata ri ah, as we unitedly seek answer tc this secret which the king desires re vealed to him. Thou hast answered my servants in aays of old, answer thou us in this thing that Innocent lives may be spared and we may be precious In thy sight. Unto Joseph aiasi tnou give wisdom to ' answer Pharaoh and to unfold to him bis dream. Do thou now hear the prayer of thy servant and again give answer that the name of Jehovah may be Known ana nis majesty and power. mad manifest, so that the king may know that there Is no other God like the God of the Hebrews, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac and of Jacob." A strange feeling stole over the heart of the wiseman. Never had b heard one of their gods addressed In this Intimate way. Never before bad he known one to pray with such quiet confidence. He listened half expecting to beat tbe very voice of the God of the He. brew answering blm. But all way sun.. The other man makes no answer.' whispered Arioch, who had beard but had not understood No," half-lmpatiently responded the other, moving softly away, and beck- oning Arioch to follow; "but be will. Thou shalt bear more of It to-mor row." But art thou not .going to see this Daniel T" inquired Arioch, wondering at the sudden change which had com over the wiseman. "Nay," he rejoined, teeUly, "but we will have good reason to know him on the morrow, I verily believe." And without further word the wiseman left Arioch standing In wonder watching him as he disappeared within his own doorway. All the kingdom was astir over the strange events of the past few days. it had been known that the king had had a dream and that be had sum moned his wlsemen from far and near that they might reveal : to him the meaning thereof. Then had com the startling news that they had failed and had been condemned to death. And while the executioners were preparing to carry out the decree of the king a strange delay bad occurred and the people stood about the streets awaiting they knew not what. All kinds of rn- mors were afloat among the stories being one that one of th. i. ..a come down to visit the king and. was about to tell him bis dream and de liver all tbe wise men from death by in swora. "What Is there to this story?" ques tioned the astrologers and the sooth sayers anxiously of the chief wlsemen as they gathered together the next morning to discuss th Strang course or events. "Not one of the gods, but THE God hath sent his servant" exclaimed the wiseman, pointing to a figur which at that moment was seen to be approach ing in gat to the palace. All eyes were turned In the direc tion indicated. They beheld a man nay, more than a man, for his face and Deanng was of one who bad seen a vision and was under th guidance of an unseen power. He looked neither to the right band nor to the left He paused not to be announced, but walked straight Into the great audi' enc room of th king, "It is Daniel!" ejaculated the wis, man.
