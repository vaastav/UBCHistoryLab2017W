Tho boom of Senator Knox of Pennsylvania for the presidency was formally launched at a notable banquet here tonight. when the Pennsylvania Republican congressional delegation placed itself squarely on record in favor of tho Pennsylvania senator.

Mr. Knox's declaration that the sug gestion ojlas candidacy must rest uponhls-publlcucareer and the wishes of the Republicans of Pennsylvania, was heartily applauded. Knox said: "For the too generous words of commendation spoken tonight, permit me to thank you all most Mncerely. I value them, especially, as words of approval of such public services as I have been enabled to render la tho past. As to the suggestion of pos sible higher service upon such founda tion as my public record and the wishes of Pennsylvania Republicans supply, I wish I could feel as certain of the value of the one as I feel grati tude for the confidence implied in the other.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Dec. 4. In the Supreme Court of the Uniteu States at Washington this week two Republican Attorneys General will contend for the doctrine of "State's rlgths." This is an interesting of somewhat startling . "reversal of form," rights' for antagonism to "State's, has been the attitude of the LRERubllcan party from time lmmemo- UrluV Herbert S. Hadlc the Re'-bllcHD Attorney General, of Missouri, will make a strong argument In favor of "State's rights" before the court in defense of Edward T. Young, tbe Re publican Attorney General of Minne sota, who undertook to enforce a 2 cent passenger-rate law against the railroads of his State and soon found himself up agains.t injunction pro ceedings, and eventually in contempt of the Federal court. He was fined $100 and too the case to the Su preme Court of the United States. The chief basis of .contention of General Hadley, who will be asslswu by F. W. Lehman, of St. Louis, as special counsel, will be that a pro ceeding against- an executive officer of a Stato IS a proceeding against- the State itself, and, therefore. Is cun trary to the spirit and letter of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitu tion of the United States. Following out this line of argument he will further contend that IT the people of a Stato are not permitted to enforce obedience and observance of. their of their own laws they will In effect be reduced to a condition of mere tutelage under the direction of the in ferior Federal courts, destroying ut- terly the sovereignty of the State. In his printed brief. Attorney Gsn eral Hadley makes some remarks that dt an usually Interesting character, coming as they do from a Republican State officer. This is a summing u at his argument in support of the doctrine of "State's rights." "As was said at the bsglnnlng oi this argument, all that ts to be said upon this question has been said, ina well said, many times before TIkto are certain cases against officers of a State that all can acreo ara rot suits against State within the mean ing of the Eleventh Amendment.

Both sides apprehend much difficulty in getting a jury and it is said that the taking of testimony might not com mence before two weeks. When seen by tho Associated Press Ruef declin ed to make any statement In reply to Heners assertion that the former political bos3 was not put on the stand "because he could not be trust ed and for the further reason that he called for full Immunity." Ruef, how ever, said he might have, something to say in reply in the near future. Court has heretofore decline,! to .-a-Joln the members of the Railroad Commission of a State from enfoic lng a schedule of maximum railroad rate3 on the plea that their enforce ment would deprive the complainants of their property without duo process of law. This court, and no Federal Court, prior to the decision of the Judge of the United States Circuit Court for the Third Distr.ct of Min nesota, ever granted an injunction restraining the chief law officer or a State from the Institution In the courts of bis State, as a result of his (Secutlve discretion and under his general authority as chief law officer of the State, a suit to compel oiai ence to the Iaw3 of his State. "The sovereignty belonging to tho several States under our system of government, which they did not sur render by becoming parties U tho Federal compact, includes the right to Institute suits In their own court and- the right not to be sual In tho Federal courts.

READY TO STOP RIOT I GOLDFIELD vm-MCH'ieoGtiimiuii-ui'-iitVTOtitvi- Sparks, Roosevelt Orders Soldiers to Prepare for Busness. NEVADA IS WITHOUT A STATE MILITIA Mine Owners and Miners Are Hopelessly Split and No Effort Made for Peace. WASHINGTON. Dec. 4. The pres ident has Issued orders to have fed eral troops held In readiness to aid in restoring order at Goldfield, Nev. The action Is taken upon representa tion from Governor Sparks, that the miners at Goldfield are In revolt and rioting. Nevada Is iie ono stato In tho union which has no militia. Sparks does not deem the situation such as to Justify Immediate federal Interfer ence, but one likely at any time to get beyond his ability to control. The nearest federal military bass is San Francisco. GOLDFIELD, Nev., Dec. 4. The lo cal miners' strike is In a deadlock, without either side making an effort to bring about an agreement. The mine owners and miners each have resolved that the other had broken agreemeqts. Tho mine owners allege that the miners violated tho strike agreement by striking without the agreed two thirds vote, while the miners met to day and declared the owners violated the agreement to pay wage3 in gold, Ignoring tho fact that there was noth ing in the agreement .on tho subject. Both sides seem to have settled down to a long drawn out fight. A repre sentative of the smelter combine has reached Goldfield and .has opened ne gotiations forthe .purchase of low grade" ores"6f tfiedlstrict, the offer -, being to take all ores -up to $40 per ton -value, paying one:thIrd cash when at the .smelter and .tho. balance forty-fivd days. "As very little of low grade is shipped from tho dls-? trict tne proposition is regarded as only a subterfuge but. as some iort is oeing maae to relieve the su uatlon, the Chamber of Commero committee, which arranged for meetings all over the state deman lng of congress and the president;. investigation of tho smelter trust. called oft the meetings and will further developments. The executive committee of Mine Owners' Association tonight' celved assurances from Gover Sparks that he had called upon Wa mgton requesting that governmd troops be held in readiness for in Nevada mining camps and a son of regulars established in Go field. There Is nothing In the irm? diate situation to require lntervent by troops. The town is quiet as usuafcl It is' feared by the mine owners thatj iroupie is Drewing ana warpverra uugui uv uuuiimiieu at any lime, ina mine owners propose to keep the mines shut down until the violent ele ment of the Miners' Union and the lawless clement generally la the camps are compelled to leave. "The Miners' Union is not prepared to make sj long fight as the treasury Is depleted. It is believed that for that reason the miners will force the Issue and violence has been threatened. Money has been scarce in Goldfield since the two banks closed and scrip was resorted to by the third bank and as all the mines have been shut down several days, the pinch of poverty Is being felt by tho miners, who aa a rule are an improvident lot, living from hand to mouth. Hold nos and burglaries have been frequent of late. attributable to the fact there is a general feeling of unrest which Is likely to break out into general riot before long. It is protectlonary rea sons more than because of the acute situation that Impelled the call for troops. This Is the last stand, appar ently to be made by tho Western Fed eration of Miners and It 13 expected that they will make a bitter and des perato fight. Funston Ready. SAN
