THE SAFE PLACE. The Women's Toggery BASEBALL TEAM IS SWING OVER COUNTRY Few Remaining Members of Bisbee Contingent Leave for Their Homes Sport Proved Clean and Interesting. After one of the most successful season In tho history of the Warren District, so far as tho national sport Is concerned, the members of the ills- 'inlTeithcr "to ti Pacific coast, or to their homes in tho Middle Western states. The last of the members left on yesterday morning's train for the east. Ud to the present season the sport of base ball In the Warren district was never taken seriously, and the public cavo practically no support to tho team which represented it. Early In tho fall tho base ball lever strucK ih larritnrv oYi.1 all of the cities of any size In tils section of the country secured good teams 10 represent them. A number of local business men wanted to see Bisbee's among the hest teams, and like tho business men of other sections, imported a number of players. What the callDro 01 me lanous members of tho team was la known to those of the public who followed the games during the season. "Bisbeo now holds the championship of this sec5 tion of tho country, having won sir cames out of eleven irora I'noenii, the only other team which made any pretentions to championship honors. Taking tne team as a wnoie, mere is no doubt that Bisbee was represented by a team of gentlemen as well as fast ball players and the local grounds were not the scene of any of those occurrences which marred tho sport in other places. As ball tossers tne proved their right to the laurel. A great deal of the credit for thf team's work Is due to the captain, Harry Cheek, who throughout the sea son took care of the additional duties falling upon him, as well as the dif ficult catcher's position, without sver once losing his head. A great deal, in fact, more than the public realizes, de pends on the working together of the different members of a team, and In this line Cheek showed great ability as an organizer. Several of the members of the team during next season will play with the big eastern leaguers, while others will be given chances-on the Pacific coast, and in the Middle Western states. All o the bovs on leaving stated that thev were delighted with the treatment they had received In Bis bee, and would be glad to return nere next fall, after the season Is over in tho east. Those business men who gave a great deal of their time and money for the support or the clna, ana arrangea the various and costly dtalls which are -incidental to the "Maintenance of an organization of this kind, are also deserving of thanks from the people of the district The national sport Is a clean game, and as played during the past couple of months by the tam representing Bisbee, more cnte:ta.u ing than has ever bes.i seen In tho district before. 

STATE RIHTS FINALLY IN HIGH COURT SMJLL-POX SCARE HAS NOW PASSED Both Patients Are Well, and No Further Trouble Is Now Looked For. Although only about ten idays agJ it was feared by the medical author ities of the city that in addition to the usual typhoid fever epidemic, which was very slight this year, Bis bee was doomed to have a contest with the scourge of smallpox, all dan ger of that now seems to haVe com pletely disappeared. One of the men who was quarantined with the dis ease has now completed recovered and been released, while the other Is convalescent, and will be able to re turn to his home within a few days. was found in the district about three weeks ago, when Nathaniel Ellis, a carpenter, was taken down, and the attending physician diagnosed his case as one of smallpox. The auth ortles were notified at once, and be cause of the lack of a -pest house, the patient was removed to a tent on the side of the mountain above the Spray shaft. Ellis had been working with a number of men 'and it was fearod that they bad contracted the disease, but the fears proved groundless. One week ago Sunday, John Davis was stricken with the disease and was also taken to the temporary iso lutlon camp. ' During the past week the local phy sicians have been on the alert to de tect the slightest sign of the disease, but in no instance has It mado its appearance, so that a feeling of great relief Is felt ARIZONA FREIGHTS CLEARLHOO HIGH Costs More From El Paso Than To That Point From " the East.

In Its name and on its behalf, could sue in the courts of the State to forfeit the license of the railroad company for Its failure vo comply with. Its contract with the State. If a State can exercise this attriDute or sovereignty only tarough Its Attorney General, how can It be reasonably ald that such a suit is not the state's action? It it is the State's action, how can it he enjoined without violating the Eleventh Amend ment to the Fereral Constitution? "If the people of the several States In 1798 had been advised taat tfie States were not protected by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendmenv in their right to Institute suits In their own laws, how impotent and in effective would this amendment have seemed for the accomplishment of the purposes thereby sought to be ef fected. To deny this right to the State deprives them of one of the most Important and essential attri butes of sovereignty "It reduces them to a condition ot tutelage under the direction and con trol of the Inferior United States courts, to which would thus be given a practical veto power upon the acts of their legislative departments, and a general supervision ana control over the representatives of the execu tive department In the performance of their official duties. Such a result would disorganize the harmony oT cur system of government and reduce to an Irreducible minimum the sov ereignty of the States." o SHONTS IS ELECTED. TEDDY BEAR . THIRD TERM GLJIBJSSffiK (Tucson Dally Star.) During the months of August and September there was big talk about a movement on foot in the territory. having for Its purpose the bringing to the attention of the interstate com merce commission several glaring un fair freight rates'! as applied tot Ari zona points. The movement was the outgrowth pf agltatlaHjJathe lower house of the twenty-fourth assembly In favor of the passage of a freight and fare bill and ttie-creauon ol a territorial railroad commission. Sev eral bills were introduced' in both houses of the legislature, but for var ious reasons, the principal one, how ever, being the strengtff of the rail road lobby, all bills dfed in commit tee. Them it was proposed that an association be formed, supported by private subscription, for the purpose of carrying forward the wore which was delegated to tho commission un der tho railroad commission act A local movement was started in Tuc son. A subscription list was circu lated and an expert freight traffic man was to bo employed to compile the necessary data at this point Anoth er movement, having the same pur pose In view, was; jaunchedjat Phoe nix, and at ono time' it was; announced that there would to a terrltoriatfmeet ing at Phoenix for tho purpose of ef fecting an organization. At this writing all or these embryo movements have faded away. A year has almost elapsed since the adjourn ment of the last legislature ana Ari zona merchants and shippers are no nearer fair treatment as to freight rates in this territory than they were five years ago.

PITTSBURG, Dec. 4 Three more bodies of miners were found late to day in the Naomi mine, near Fayette City. The total dead is now twenty seven, all but two of whoa have been Identified. o ..

Suit of Washington, Is appointed physician at the Westers Naval school. Is of vital Importance to every com munity, and to every citizen of every community? - Recently the Star had a glowing ex ample of the unfair freight rates charged In Arizona. A carload of news paper was purchased at Rheln lander, Wisconsin. Now. Rheinlander, tVisconsln, Is approximately two tnou- sand miles northeast of El Paso, Tex as. The car comes from Rheinlander, Wisconsin, to Chicago, Illinois; thence from Chicago to Kansas City; thence from Kansas City to El Paso. THE FREIGHT RATE FROM RHEINLAN DER TO -EL. PASO, TEXAS, IS 75 CENTS PER HUNDRED POUNDS. Now, at El Paso the car Is turned over to the Southern Pacific to haul from El Paso to Tucson, a distance of approximately three hundred mires. THE FREIGHT RATE ON THIS SAME, CAR OF PAPER FROM EL PASO TO TUCSON IS $1.08 CENTS PER HUNDRED POUNDS. It costs 33 cents per 100 pounds more to haul a car of paper from El Paso, Texas, to Tucson, than Is charged by the railroads to haul this same car of paper from "Wisconsin to El Paso. vS The same Is true ot all third class freight In carload lots. The Star re cites the above example for It knows whereof it speaks. But any merchant In Tucson can tell yon the same story. It need not be Inferred that the Southern Pacific company is tho only offender. The rate would have been the same If the car bad come over the Santa Fe to Phoenix or over the E. P. and S. W. to Bisbee. IS IT ANY WONDER THAT THE COST OF LIVING IS HIGH IN ARI ZONA? Do you suppose for one moment that if such freight .rates were called to the attention ot the interstate com merce commission that a hearing would not be ordered immediately? At such a. hearing It would 'devolve upon the railroad company to show why it is necessary on their part to charge more for hauling a car three Lhundred miles than it costs to Haul tho same car two thousand miles. The Tucson, Bisbee, Nogales, Globe and Phoenix chambers of commerce have a great work to perform In this direction. It would be Just as well to suspend, temporarily, the issuance of pamphlets and printed matter invit ing new comers to Arizona and take this same: money and devote It to the purpose of securing fair freight rates for a sectioa of the southwest that Is beisg retarded aad held up by exorbi tant freight ratesv WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? Ignoring of Statehood Issue By Strenuous Hero Has Greatly Weakened Their Weak Posi tion With People. Ever since the publication ot the president's message to congress. which contained nothing In regard to statehood, although the chief execu tive fetatiwt that h wa(n fvt,VP ww lltlcal autonomy for Arizona andNew Mexico, those who have been engaged in the work of organizing clubs In the territory for the express purpose of sending an instructed delegation to tho Republican National Convention next year for Roosevelt, have felt their position greatly weakened. With the announcement of Joseph B. Fora kcr's candidacy and the Ignoring ot the Issue which is dearest to all Atl- zonans by the president, there seems to be almost no chance ot any Repub lican delegation from this territory at tending a convention except ono that Is Instructed to vote for Arizona s friend, the Senator from Ohio. After the statehood fight of a year ago, when the president's policy was tcorned with such disdain by tho peo ple of this territory, the supporters of the strenuous and crafty politician hoped that he would give forth some utterance which would at least make their open advocacy of his cause for a third term tenable, while steam' lng down the Mississippi, the utter ance was given to the people of Ari zona through Senator Flint of Cali fornia, the president announcing that he favored single statehood In view of the firm manner in which Arizona rejected his pet plan of a union with New Mexico. Although Roosevelt authorized the statement there were many RepubU cans in the territory who, like the Democrats, were dissatisfied with such an indefinite announcement and demanded that the chief executive for tify his remarks by assurances that he would work as hard for single statehood as he did to strangle Ari zona. The object of the contention seemed to be to ascertain, whether the Terrible Teday was playing poli tics and endeavoring to secure Ari zona's delegation in the convention, as it is now practically admitted that he will run again. The action ot the chief executive in Ignoring the statehood issue com pletely In his present message when his party endorsed it consistently up to .a couple of years ago, when he took such active measures witli Bev eridge. Cannon et al, to force Arizona into a union with New Mexico, seems to Indicate plainly that the Erratic One's solicitude for single statehood and Justice to the territory is not so keen; in fact amounts to nothing but a strategical political move. The chance of Roosevelt's getting a delegation from this territory in preference to Senator Foraker, was indeed very slim even though he had declared for the right kind of state hood but even that is now gone, ow ing to his weak policy He evidently "consulted with the party leaders," and' Beveridge and Cannon turned their thumbs down. The G .O. P. of Arizona now owes no allegiance whatever to the nation al administration; "past wrongs were covered over with a balm that proved unsoothing, and opportunity to show sincerity has been allowed to pass by the president. On the other hand the venerable senator from Ohio who, during the past twelve years has fought for the sacred political rights of the people of the territory, against the machinations of Roosevelt and others, and to whom is due a great portion of the credit for the fact that tney are not now governed from aonta re, needs weir support, une year ago Foraker could have had any gift within the reach of the people ot Arizona, and there is no doubt that the Republicans of the Territory will demonstrate to the president that, as well as being hard fighters, they are true friends. There can be only one right kind ot a delegation from Arizona to the Republican National Convention and that Is one Instructed to vote first, last and all ot tno time for Joseph B. Foraker, the Senator from Ohio. o
