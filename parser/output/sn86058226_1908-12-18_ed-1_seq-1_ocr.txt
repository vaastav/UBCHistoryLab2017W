MIND ABOUT MEN RULES CHANGED TD SECURE CONTROL OF STATE SENATE Committee Appointed to Draw Up Rules to Govern Next Session to Meet and Follow Its Orders. HALL TO BE DEPRIVED OF ALL HIS POWER Effort May Be Made to Have Legislature Pass Resolu tion for Calling Constitu tional Convention. (By Special State Correspondent.) Indianapolis, Dec. 18. Senator Lin ton A. Cox, of this city, who is a member of the committee that was appointed at the meeting of the re publican senators a week or so ago to prepare a set of rules to govern the delibera tions of the sen ate at the com ing session, said last night, that the committee will hold a meeting in this city within the next few days and frame up a set of rules. The other mem- Ellis Searles. bers of the committee are Senator Forkner, of Henry county and Senator-elect Ralph Knne, of Hamilton county. Senator Cox says it is the intention of the committee to make some im portant amendments to the present rules of the- senate. These amend ments' vlll have ; for their main 'pur pose the securing to the republicans of absolute control of the senate from the time the curtain goes up till the last work is spoken. The republicans have a clear majority in the senate and they do not propose to lose 'any of the power and privileges that this situation gives them,, even though the democrats will have the presiding of ficer of the body. Hall Deprived of Power. One of the most Important changes In the rules will be one that will take away from the lieutenant governor the power to appoint members of com mittees and give that power to the senate itself. This will insure a ma jority of republicans on all the com mittees and a republican chairman for each committee as well, thus main taining a complete republican organ ization. Lieutenant Governor. Hall "will not have much left for himself. He i will be permitted to call the sen ate to order, wield the gavel, invite ministers to offer the prayers and to cast the deciding vote in case of a tie. Senator Cox says the republicans may permit him to name the minor ity members of the committees but even this is not yet certain. And they may allow him to name his own pages. But all other officials and em ployes of the senate will be chosen by the republicans. Look Far Ahead. Another thing the republican com mittee has in mind, according to Sen ator Cox is a change in the rule so that all important matters must be decided by a majority of the entire vote of the senate instead of a major ity of the vote of all senators present. This will be a mighty important mat ter to the republicans because of the plim majority which they have in the penate. Under the present rule, if it were allowed to remain in force, the democrats might easily take advant age of the absence of two or three re publican senators from the chamber and adopt or change rules in such a ;ay as to greatly ambarass the ma jority.. But under the proposed rule this will be impossible, as the demo crats, with their near-majority would be unable to do anything without re publican help. Course is Right. The republicans have been severely criticized by the democrats for their ftnnotinoed purpose to assume sand bold control of the senate, but the re publicans are recalling history and pointing to the time when Greene Smith, democrat, was forcibly install ed as lieutenant governor and pre siding officer of the senate after Rob ert S. Robertson, of Ft. Wayne, who bad been legally elected lieutenant governor, had been forcibly removed from the chair. This high-handed outrage which almost produced a riot and a revolution is still fresh in the minds of many men and they point out that the determination of the re publlcans at this time to retain control of the senate cannot be compared to that outrage. All except the most (Continued on Page Two.) 'v IT ' HE

HELD ILLEGAL Appellate Court Reverses De cision of Lower Courts in Greensfork Case. APPEAL IS IMPROBABLE. COW LOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DI VISION OF OPINION IN LITTLE TOWN FOR THE PAST SEVER AL YEARS. By a decision of the Appellate court rendered yesterday, the verdicts of the commissioners' court and Special Judge Newman of the circuit court, in the case involving the incorporation of the town of Greensfork are revers ed. The higher court has decided the incorporation is illegal. It is not prob able the case will be taken to the supreme court. The verdict ends a controversy that has been waged for several years. By revising the boun dary lines of the proposed, incorpor Ati'oiC"!" might become possible to bring about the same purpose. Court's Fino'ing. In its decision, the court found: The running of the boundary lines of a town under the power conferred by Sec. 8975 to 8P83, Burns. 190S, when seeking to incorporate, was ille gal by reason of the unreasonable and unwarrantable manner in which such power was exercised where the boundaries .were made to include ap pellant's cow pasture, entirely separ ated from the platted part of the town by intervening lands. Which pasture wa3 not used as part of the town nor held for sale as part thereof, while an intervening strip 220 feet wide on the side of appellant's land and adjoining the platted town was excluded in or der not to take in the public school building and the evidence shows that the town had grown but little in busi ness or population in fifty years and does not now have any unusual growth. The case as it appeared on the ap pellate court docket was entitled: Alonzo M. Harris vs Eden Martindale et al. The case had been argued last month after being on file for two years. Eden Martindale and other residents, of Greensfork, who sought to have the town incorporated were represented by Wilfred Jessup. Alon zo Harris, who appeared as the re monstrator, was represented in the li tigation by Addison C. Harris, John L. Rupe and Thomas J. Study. The same grounds for opposing the pro position that were presented in the lower courts were used for argument in the appellate court. History of Case. For many years, certain residents of Greensfork had been endeavoring to have the town incorporated. Incorpor ation was desired In order to secure home rule and other considerations not possible when the sole authority is invested in the county officials and township trustee.

The celebrated case of the Peoples Loan & Trust Company, of Winches ter, vs. Edwin M. Campfield. of this city, which involved the ownership of the Colonial building and annex, was decided by Judge Fox, of the Wayne, circuit court today. The court holds the plaintiff is entitled to foreclose a mortgage of $70,000 held by it on the property. An order for the sale of the property may be had at any time. The suit lias been in litigation since last March. At tiie present time the property is in the hands of a receiver and the court's action does not inter rupt the receivership. The court holds that the First National bank, which is named as one of the defen dants, is entitled to the rentals and income from the Colonial building tin til a note it holds against Campfield is satisfied. Soon after the receiver was appointed for the building, it was damaged by fire and a part of the structure has not been rebuilt pending the decision of the court. Campfield's Troubles. It will be remembered the State canceled the the contract it had with Campfield for the construction of the Southeastern Hospital for the Insane, located at Madison, Ind. It is' claimed by Cam; "eld's friends that the con tractor would have been able to meet his notes on the. Colonial building had not his troubles in connection with .the hospital taken away this source of revenue. Suit was instituted against Camp field, by James P. Goodrich, president and attorney for the Peoples Loan & Trust Company. When Campfield's note for $5,000 came due December 1 of last year, Goodrich saw the money could not "be secured in cash. He made an arrangement with Campfield whereby he would take a chattel mortgage on the machinery and per sonal property of Campfield, that was used in the construction of the Insane hospital. He, also, was to take a mortgage on a farm in Ohio and to permit the debt to run until enough had been realized to pay the principal on the mortgage. The day after Goodrich took the mortgage on the farm he had it enter ed for record and found that a deed had ben recorded the day before, deeding the farm to Campfield's mother and not making provision for any mortgage. Campfield's mother wrote to Goodrich and demanded the release of the mortgage. Under the Ohio law, hex warranty deed had been made without reference to the mort gage, so the mortgage was valueless. Goodrich Investigates. Goodrich made an investigation of his chattel mortgage on the personal property of Campfield and found it was claimed by the owners, who said they had sold it to Campfield condi tionally and held liens on it. Good rich took the position that Campfield's credit was lost and refused to give Campfield credit. Campfield made no other offers of settlement. Under the terms of the contract, the default in the payment of one note made all others come due. The de fendant entered a plea of abatement in the Wayne circuit court to show there had been no default. The court held there had been and ordered the trial of the case on its merit. It was (Continued on Page Five.) Kelleher. William, son; died Jan. 14, l".OS: heart disease. Knowles. Annit T.. sister-in-law: died March 1. 1!W: bronchitis. Knowles.

The district attorney said to day: "The police have brought to my at tention the deaths in the Kelleher fam ily. I told them to go ahead and make whatever investigation seemed neces sary, but that I was not ready to ex hume an entire graveyard until further evidence in the case should be brought before aie." Mrs. Kelleher is accused of setting fire to the house of Andrew J. Lovell ot Cambridge, by whom she was employ ed as a domestic. 

SUIT THIS YEAR'S COLLECTIONS The eleven months in which the depository law has been operated, $:'.. 867.66 has been paid to the county in interest. Under the provisions of the old law this sum would have been lost, so far as the county is concern ed. The law provides that all but a certain proportion of this money shall be placed in the general fund. The remainder, which amounts to about $200 goes to the school fund. The monthly collections of interest since the first of the yer have been: January $:527. 99: February $196.34: March' $237.59; April $354.97: May $616.77; June $301.99: July $307.8."); August $211.15; September $241.39; Octot?r $294.74; November $536.34. The interest paid during May and November was made unusually large owing to the increased receipts by the county treasurer as the semi-annual installment of taxes was paid. A number of tax payers prefers to pay the entire amount at the May install ment and for this reason May was a larger interest securing mont'i than November, when the second install ment falls due. PRESIDENT REBUKES SEMINARY GIRLS Strikes Horse Ridden Dy One And She Has Narrow Escape. PARTY MUCH MORTIFIED GIRLS HAD RIDDEN AROUND THE PRESIDENTIAL PARTY . AND ROOSEVELT SEEMED FURIOUS AT ACTION. Washington, Dec. IS. A local even ing paper printed the following Thurs day. "How President Roosevelt severely rebuked a party from the National Park Seminary at Forest Glen, Md., tor riding past him Thanksgiving Day in Rock Creek park and how he caus ed the horse one of the girls was rid ing to rear and plunge by striking it with his riding whip is told in a sto ry which has pust leaked out and been confirmed by Miss E. I. Sisson, teacher In the school, who was the chaperone for the party. "Miss Sisson and three of the girls of the institution, whose names are withheld, went for a horseback ride through Rock Creek Park Thanksgiv ing morning. As they were jogging along one of the tree-lined roads of the National Reserve they saw a party ahead of them, which included two wo men and two men. As they closed up the gap between the two parties. Miss Sisson says she recognized one of the men as President Roosevelt. "For some time the seminary party rode slowly behind the chief executive party. Bui the spirited animals wanted to go faster, declares Miss Sisson, and finally the girls galloped past the presidential party. "When they slowed their horses down again a few minutes later they heard rapid hoofbeats behind them. The rider was pressing his horse hard and he soon overtook them. " 'As we were riding four abreast at the time, the president's horse crowd ed us no little as he dashed past.' said Miss Sissou, continuing the narrative. 'As he brushed past, his horse struck the foot of one of the young ladies, knocking it from the stirrup, and a blow from the president's crop fell on the horse's flank. The young wo man's horse reared, and but for her coolness and admirable horsemanship, she might have been thrown beneath the feet of the horses. I do not know whether the blow was intentional." " 'You know that you should not go ahead of our party," said the president as he rode past and turned in the sad dle to look squarely in her face. He then joined his companions. " 'Naturally we felt much mortified. None of us intended to affront the president, and I cannot understand his action. The president appeared to Ik in a rage, but, of course. I do not know about that. I only know how we felt about it. 1 prefer not to give the names of the young ladies in the par ty. They are daughters of wealthy parents, highly connected, and I an1 sure their parents would object to the notoriety aitending such an affair.' "' THE

WOULDN'T BURN LETTERS BUTPR0MISED "BURNING" Mrs. Cheesman Alleged to Have, Threatened Punish mentLetters Will Be Re turned to Wife. It is alleged that Mrs. Kftie ncrtsch of Centerville, the alleged affinity of the late K. M. Cheesman. secured money from him. It is further re ported about town, that Mrs. Chees man, after the death of her husband, went to Mrs. Bertsch and demanded the return of all the money she had secured from Cheesman. This morning Postmaster J. A. Spekenhier denied this report. He said that when Mrs. Cheesman ap peared before hint and Post Office In spector W. T. Fletcher, she said that the diamonds and other things Mrs. Bertsch was wearing had been pur chased by money furnished by her husband, but that she did not want1 this money refunded to her. Mr. Spekenhier states that Mrs. Chees man stated that all she wanted "was revenge." It was also stated to a Palladium re porter, that Mrs. Cheesman after the death of her husband went to see Mrs. Bersch and told her that she had learned through letters found in her husband's effects that she and Chees man had intimate relations. It is alleged that after she had made this statement to her husband's affinity. Mrs. Bertsch said, "Well, Dear, you burn those letters up." It is said that Mrs. Cheesman in answer, replied, "No, I won't burn those letters up, but I intend to burn you up." After Mrs. Bertsch's trial all of her letters will be returned to Mrs. Chees man. Mr. Spekenhier states that when Mrs. Cheesman turned over the four hundred letters of Mrs. Bertsch. to Postoffice Inspector Fletcher, she made a formal demand upon the gov ernment that these letters be returned to her after the trial or her rival. It is generally believed that Mrs. Bertsch will be convicted of the charge placed against her. Postoffice inspec tors and members of the United States secret service, have a ccoe of honor which provides that no arrest shall be made in any case unless the evidence is such that it is an absolute certain ty that the accused will he convicted. Postoffice Inspector Fletcher, who se cured the evidence in this case, has been in the government service for the past thirty jearsr People who have seen some of the letters alleged to have been written by Mrs. Bertsch to Cheesman. state that some of the statements made in them are so highly flavored that it would be impossible for the yellowest kind of a journal to reproduce them. "DARK HORSE" MAY WIN SENATORIAL RACE There Is Sure to Be Long-Drawn-Out Contest. Indianapolis. Ind.. Dec. 1v There is considerable discussion today of the probability of a "dark horse" winning the senatorial race in case the legisla ture is not able to agree on any of the avowed candidates.

A WORK AND IT IS THOUGHT WILL DE LIVER DEDICATORY ADDRESS. "I am sorry to say that I have felt obliged to decline all new invitations recently, because it seems absolutely necessary to hold my time for a ser ies of important lectures promised for Harvard university; and I need particularly to keep the coming days of vacation clear of appointments. I feel compelled therefore to decline your very kind invitation. Sincerely yours, HENRY C. KING." With the keenest disapioinment Secretary G. L. Goodwin of the local Y. M. C. A. today read the above let ter. Dr. King is president of Ober lin college and one of the most prom inent religious and educational work ers in the United States. He was wanted to deliver tie dedicatory ad dress at the dedication of the Rich mond Y. M. C. A. building, Sunday, December 27, Bosworth Invited. Mr. Goodwin states that he has now sent an Invitation to Dr. Edward I. Bosworth, dean of the Oberlin semin ary, asking him to deliver the dedi catory address and he expects to re ceive a favorable reply to his invita tion. Dr. Bosworth takes the most active interest in Y. M. C. A. work and is known as an eloquent speaker. E. L. Shuey, a prominent Dayton business man and for years an ener getic Y. M. C. A. worker, has accept ed the invitation extended to him to deliver the principal address at the re ception held at the Y. M. C.

Mr. Shuey is particularly well qualified to speak on the subject, "The educa tional work of the Y. M. C. A., how it effects the employer and employe and the mutual benefits they will derive."

DEDICATION He Can Do So Without Jeop ardizing His Own Political Future and the Party That Elected Him. . FAIRBANKS HIT BY THE PANAMA CANAL CHARGES Smith Is a Relative and Vice President Will Not Now Get Ambassadorship to Eng land. , By Sheldon S. Cline. Washington. Dec. IS. Republican leaders in Congress say they have no desire to quarrel with President Roosevelt between now and March -4. It is very apparent the President ia not going to run away from a quar rel; but. then, the President is going out of office in less than three mouths and Republicans in Congress, except those who fell by the wayside last November, have got to keep on doing business. Mr. Roosevelt's fri -mis predicted two months ago that the President would "turn loose" this winter and indulge In some plain speaking. The prediction Is being abundantly ful filled. Never before did official com munications from the White House to the Capitol so "bluntly call a spade a spade. And he has made no secret of the fact that he has other plain lan guage In stock ready for use should Congress invite its issuance. Can Have "Say" Now. When you come to think of It, there is no good reason why the President should not now speak his mind. He has champed at his bit, as It were, for several years because par ty and other considerations made It inadvisable for hint to employ the language be wanted to use in dis cussing divers men and measures. He can have his say now without Jeop ardizing his own political fortunes or seriously threatening the fortunes of his party. Country Enjoys Situation. Congress makes no pretense of lik ing the things that have been handed it, but, on the whole, the country ap pears to rather enjoy the . situation. There are those, of course, who crit icise the President for his most re cent strenuosity, but the critic w always have with us. This criticism is not going to bother Mr. Roosevelt hugely. He 1s firmly convinced that public opinion will hack him up, and believes the more he lambasts Con gress, the greater his popularity. Ami it would seem that he Is justified In this belief. . Cannot Endure Criticism. Congress, however Is in no position to endure public criticism; certainly not more so at this time than In the past. Senators laughed when the president's Vpecial Panama message was read. They would like tu pas off all his strictures. as a laughing mat ter, but they can't quite do that. Sen atorial dignity has got to defend itself, even If defense be a precarious enter prise to venture upon. There Isn't any matter of doubt, though that Congress will breathe a long Bigh of relief when William H. Taft has taken the oath and qualified as Theodore Roosevelt's successor. The present strenuosity of ,Mr. Roosevelt, by the way. is going to b of very material assistance to Mr. Taft. Mr. Taft is much more con servative by nature than Is the pres ent executive, but on occasions he has demonstrated that he can strike-and strike hard. Congress, very desirous of a rest, isn't going to Invite any blows from the incoming president. Single Head in D. C. President Roosevelt's stand in favor of a single executive head for the gov ernment of the District of Columbia, has revived interest in this very im portant project, but it is not believed the president's menage to congress will result ia securing any action at ,the present session. The time is too ; short to lake up and dispose of so com 1 plicated a matter, even were the two ; houses so dipoed. A more import ' ant reason '.3 that the matter has not i before been made the subject of presl- dential recommendation and congress, j with its prejudice against innovations, ! always has to be hammered at a while ! before it will undertake a thing of thi3 kind. Bat even were conditions at the cap- Itol right for the passage of a bill changing the form of district govern ment, there remain the obstacle that the people of the district are them selves divided as to Its desirability. The present three-headed government has Just as ardent champions and the proposed single executive plan baa earnest advocates, and both factions would swarm to the capitol should congress take up the matter for bear ings before the district committee.
