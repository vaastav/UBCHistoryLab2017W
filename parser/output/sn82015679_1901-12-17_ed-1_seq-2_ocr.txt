In reply to these accusations it was said that it was legitimate for an attorney In private life to represent any Interest in hi official capacity, and it was argued that his posi tion as coun.s-Ior for those Interests could not be used legitimately against him in connection with his nomination to a posi tion under the present administration.

Court AIiio HefttrultiH Delivery of Rec ortlt Spalding AkhIii Declare Ilia Opponent Out of Haseball. . NEW YORK. Dec. 1C Andrew Freedman obtained an Injunction late this afternoon in the Supreme Court through counsel to restrain A. G. Spalding from assuming the presidency of the National Raseball League and from Interfering with the busi ness of the National League In any way. The order further restrains Nicholas E. Young from delivering to Spalding any of the books, records, or papers of the league. The defendants are ordered to show causo before Jude Holt Dec. 1J why the injunc tion should not be made permanent. In this action Mr. Freedman represented the New York, Roston, Cincinnati and St. Louis baseball clubs, these four being the organizations, who-e respective presidents left the meeting of the National League magnates at the Fifth-avenue Hotel early on Saturday morning. Mr. Freedman de clares to-night that there shall be no further controversy between him and Mr. Spalding, who stands as the representative of the other four clubs In the National League Urooklyn, Philadelphia, Chicago and rittsburg. He asserts that whatever future action may be taken to settle the light in the league will be taken In the courts. Mr. Spalding gave out In the evening copies of telegrams he had received from P. T. Powers of the Eastern League, and Ran Johnson of tho American League, in which these two men promised their co operation to Mr. Spalding. Mr. Spald'ng Is authority for the statement that the final steps in the proposed process of put ting Mr. Freedman out of the National League, rests with the stockholders of the New York club. "I am the president of the National League," declared Mr. Spald ing. "1 shall be present to preside at the future meetings of the league. In view of his actions I defy Andrew Freedman to come to the meetings of the league. I therefore declare him out cf baseball. The Freedman incident is closed." It was the opinion of many to-night that the only means by which Mr. Freedman could bo put out of the league was through the disruption of that body. It was sug gested that an amalgamation of the Ameri can and National leagues might take place and a twelve-club circuit adopted. Mr. Spalding made what was taken to be a significant remark to-day In connection with this when he said: "It may not be so easy to get playing grounds in New York, but neither will it be so easy to cut streets through grounds after Jan. 1." When Mr. Spalding and his followers be gan their meeting this afternoon, Mr. Spalding read a letter in which he notified Freedman of the hour of to-day'a meeting, asked him to be present and offered to de bate their differences. The closing para graph was: "You may consider this a pub lic challenge to meet me in public debate on this baseball question. ' Freedman or Spalding must get out of the game for good. It's up to you, Mr. Freedman. 'Play ball.' " Then Spalding read a letter from a legal firm of this city in which the lawyers taid they had read the minutes of the meeting at which Spalding was elected president and gave it as their opinion that ha had been regularly and legally elected presi dent. Mr. Spalding then took up his firm's at titude In furnishing baseballs to the league. Tho contract with the league was made ten years ago. A vota was taken and It was decided that contract should be renewed. The firm furnishes 150 balls to each club each season free of charge, all others be ing purchased at $15 per dozen. During the day Spalding had received a letter from Henry Chadwick, of Brooklyn, In which Chadwick upheld his course. Chadwick has teen getting a pension irom the league of $,"0 a month and after his letter was read Spalding moved that it be made $luJ and this was done, the matter to be finally passed at a future meeting. W. II. Conant, of Roston, said to-night he did not see how Mr. Freedman was to be got out of baseball. "There is only one provision in the constitution," he said, "under which lie can be expelled non payment of dues. I guess the thing won't go much further." Mr. Conant said emi nent counsel had declared Spalding's elec tion illegal. Mr. Soden, of Roston, said to-night: "We took the matter into court so that we could have an opinion as to the validity of Spalding's election. The case Is entirely a friendly one. We simply .want to know where we stand that we may know how to proceed."

(CONCLUDED FROM FIRST PAGE.) inoperative from floods. Many districts are inaccessible because of bad roads. Tele graphic and telephone communication, though interrupted between numerous points, has stood the strain well. Up to to-night one death has been report ed, that of a German named Patten on the Canadian Pacific Railroad, whose engine plunged into a washout. A similar acci dent on the Maine Central resulted In the Injury of three persons, one of whom may die. Madison, on the Upper Kennebec river, sustained the greatest damage from floods of any place, it being fully half a million dollars. Logs and ice crushed buildings and overturned many others, especially in one section of the town, where there are large mills. The watt-r. when at its highest, was three feet beyond the highest record in the great "pumpkin freshet" of A million feet of lumber was washed away. The. Great Northern Paper Company's loss Is very heavy. Its expensive electrical machinery was ruined, and Ufte en carloads of finished paper were destroyed. FLOOD AM) COLD WAVE. Had Night for PlttburRer Danger Over Yesterday Morning?. PITTSBURG. Dec. 16. The crest of the flood and the lowest point reached this winter . by the mercury were both regis tered at the same time, S a. m., when the Smlthfleld-street bridge marks showed twenty-live feet eight inches of water in tho Monongahela river, and tho govern ment thermometer Indicated five degrees above zero. Tho rivers are now falling here and at the headwaters, and the tem perature Is steadl.'y rising. A flood and cold wave at the same time Is almost unprecedented and only the sud den drop In the temperature averted one of tho greatest fiood In the history of Pittsburg. As it was the lover parts of the Point di.stiict and Du'iutsne and lowlands nlon th Mononir.theli river. South Side. were submerged. In Alleghany the river front was entirely under water, including lMttsburg & Western, Lacock t Robinson, Hope. Balcan, Walnut, Cherry, Madison and River avenues. The cellars In many houses were flooded and people were com pelled to move. Along the banks of the Alleghany and Pittsburg it was the most fearful night experienced in many years. Similar conditions have been practically unknown to this generation. Hundreds of men tolled all night with the gigantic coal tows, tied up to the landings on both sides of all three rives, in the face of a bitterly oold wind, drenched at times with the splashes of foam, their clothes frozen on them Immediately, and the suffering was awful. Never in the history of Pittsburg was there such a flood on such a night. The rains and snow of the past three da'3 caused the upper tributaries of the local rivers to swell, and the result was a rise almost unknown at this season of the year. Warning was sent out from the weather bureau that a flood stage was possible, and even probable, but the suddenness with which the cold air descended on Saturday night Influenced the minds of the men who were guarding the big coal fleets, and the rise came as almost a complete surprise to them. Usually a cold snap takes all the life and danger out of a flood. It failed to do so vesterday and as a result the freshet will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars that might have been saved. The damage to goods in the wharves In warehouses, stores and private houses In the two cities will never be known. It probably will reach $'.000. In addition to this many mills and factories along both rivers were forced to close down tempo rarily and thousands of men and women will be out of work from one to three days and much damage done to machinery and finished stock At midnight the Ohio river mark at the dam registered 21.3 feet and falling six inches an hour. Davis island dam is piled high with wreckage of runaway coal barges, but It is believed this will be suffl ciently cleared away by Wednesday to al low the passage south of about 15,000.000 bushels of coal ready for shipment on this rise. Ohio IllftliiK nt Cincinnati. CINCINNATI, Dec. 16. The thermometer registered 13 degrees above zero at 7 o'clock to-night, but tho Weather Bureau predicts colder weather before morning. The Ohio river has been rising rapidly at almost every point between here and Pitts burg. At Portsmouth it Is rising six inches an hour and has already reached a thirty-one-foot stage. At 6 o'clock to-night the stage in thi3 city was 27 feet 8 inches, a rise of 4 feet and 6 inches since 6 o'clock this morning. The river men here are of the opinion that 4Ü feet will be reached by Thursday morning, after which a fall is anticipated. The rise above caught the river men unprepared and many towboats were torn from their fastenings, but nearly all of them were recovered before much damage was done. Half n Million Damage. UTICA, N. Y., Dec. 1C The damage from the flood in the valley of the West Canada creek will reach RuO.000. From 75.000 to 100,000 logs were washed away from Nobles boro. Hinckley and Trenton Falls. Four expensive railroad bridges were destroyed. One mill was taken down stream like a paper box. and two others are badly wrecked. The railroad in that valley can not be operated for four or five days. The electric power plant at Trenton Falls was damaged about $3,000. OTES OF TIIH FLOOD. Collieries Shut Down Itallvrny Re- Rinning Running of Trnlns. DANGER AVERTED BY COLD. A fall of 48 degrees during Sunday night averted the danger of flood in western Massa chusetts. DAMAGE IN NEW JERSEY. More than tlOO.OuO damage has been caused at Scud der's Falls and South Trenton by the sud den rising of the Delaware river. FACTORIES CLOSED. Many industrial establishments in South Harrisburg, Pa., have been forced to close down on account of the freshet, the water in that locality being higher than at any time sipce the great flood of 1SS9. Cellars of scores of houses in that locality are filled with water and It was necessary to use boats to carry food and fuel to many residents who were unable to leave their homes. 

WATER-BOUND DELEGATES. Com munication with the outside world Is being gradually opened up at Scranton, Pa. Yes terday a train started for Philadelphia and New York over the Delaware & Hudson and the Pennsylvania Railroads via Sun burg and Harrisburg. carrying some of the delegates who had attended the Ameri can Federation of Labor convention. The others left to-night. LOSS OF $100,000. Insurance and real estate agents agree that the loss at Beth lehem. Pa., where 200 houses and a score of industrial establishments were inun dated, will aggregate 1100,000. Silk mills, electric light plants, water works and a dozen other industries are so badly dam aged that it will require another day or two to get them into condition for re sumption of operations. The town was again in darkness last night. SLOWLY RECEDING. The high water in the north branch of the Susquehanna river is slowly receding, says a dispatch from Wilkesbarre, Pa. At 9 o'clock last night it was twenty-five feet above the low water mark or two feet and one inch lower than the highest point attained Sun day night. All the lowlands, however, are still flooded, and the people living at West more and the southern suburbs are unable to leave their houses without the aid of boats. The bursting of a dam at Parsons, where water was stored for the mines in the vicinity, did much damage. FIRES AND EXPLOSIONS. Several Serion Casualties nnd Valu able Property Destroyed.
