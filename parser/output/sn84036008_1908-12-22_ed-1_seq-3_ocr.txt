WASHINGTON, 'Dec. 19.-The sen ate' had some fun today when three routine messages from the president were received and prevented the de livery of the messages in the house. Just as the secretary was beginning to read the journal, the arrival of M. C. Latta, arsistant secretary to the president with the messages was an nounced and he waited until the te dious reading of the journal had been disposed of. The reading had scarcely begun when Mr. Gallinger proposed suspend ing the reading to permit the messages to be presented as is usual, when the order of the business is under consid aration. ,Senator\Lodge wished to keep the senate in 'session long enough to get the immigrant air space bill over and insisted that the journal should be read. "I have a special reason for asking that the reading be suspended," said Senator Culberson, glancing toward Mr. Latta. "I object," interrupted Mr. 'Lodge. W'hen Mr. Lodge was satisfied that his 'bill had been signed, he arose and asked that the further reading of the journal be dispensed with.; "I object," said Mr. Gallinger. Senator Carter then interrupted the reader and endeavdred to stop the reading but tSenitor Money of Missis eippi, objected. Again 'Senator Oulberson called at tention to the presence of the presi dent's report- and' repeated his re quest. "I object," insisted IMr. Money. This running fire of requests and ob Jections was accompanied by laughter and finally the clerk was allowed to pursue his doleful reading until the journal had been completed. Then the messages were received, but the delay had overlapped the ses sion of the house,. so that when Mr. Latta reached the house he found it had adjourned and he was obliged to carry the messages back to the White House. One of the messages related to the granting of franchises for water and gas companies and for the building of a bridge anrt the improvement of a harber at Porto Rico, another asked an'appropiiation of $15,000 for the ac ceptance of the invitation of the Aus trian-Hungarian government to partic ipate in the. exposition and the third related to fixing the boundary line be tween Colorado and New 'Mexico.

He had been drinking last night. The quarrel was over money matters and jealousy. Policeman Burke has been on the police force about five years and dur ing ,that time has never had any trouble, ibeing considered one of the most careful men on the force. Witnesses state he had no choice but to kill the Jap or be shot himself, as the Jap was raining a perfect fusil lade of bullets at the policeman. It is stated here that the Japanese formerly worked as a porter in a saloon in Billings, Mont., where he be came acquainted with the negro woman. They are said to have left Billings together and proceeded to Sheridan, Wyo., where they were married September 15 last.

INSURGENTS SAY •t RWILL WIN CLAIM THEY WILL MODIFY RULES OF THE HOUSE. DEMOCRATSHOLDALOO They May Combine With the Insur gents, However, If They Can Ob tain any Advantage or Credit for the Movement. WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.-The in. surgents against the present rules of the house are leaving Washington for their homes jubilant over the pro I gress that they have made in stirring up an insurrection in the Republican ranks. They will tell their constit uents that before the ena or the ses sion the rules will be amended. One of the insurengts expresse, himself today as certain that at least one change will be -made in the rules. He said that he believed there would be opposition to it at a Republican caucus. The amnendment would pro vide for a day each wek 'for the call of committees on bills. Some of them claim that this is all that is necessary to get relief from the presnt rules A call of the committees would en able the committee to get before tbe house all of the important bills of the f various kinds it is urging, and will re lieve the speaker of liability to charges of preventing legislation which is demanded by the people. In asmuch as the house would have an opportunity to pass on the bills in the course of a short period, surely during a session of congress, the packing of a committee against a bill would have no other effect than the influence of the opinion of its mem hers upon those who had not investi gated the subject thoroughly. It is acknowledged by some or tne leaders of the insurengents that the only hope of amending the rules lies in the action ofgthe minority. The new minority leader, Representative Champ Clark of Missouri, does not feel himself bound or his party com mitted to any program until he sees how the Republicans will line up. He objects to forming an alliance wita the insurgents, which he fears may eventually be broken. The minority is willing to stanni for an amendment of the rules, it is un derstood, in accordance with the plat form of the Denver, convention, but it would like to get just as muca credit as possible for the reforms. r

MEP State of Washington Gets Interior De . partment and California Commerce d and Labor--List of the Men Whon Taft is Considering. e CINCINNATI1, Ohio, Dec. 9.-) "s Times-Star special from Augusta, Ga. says: "When P. C. Knox, the Taft secreta ry of state, comes to discuss with th, president-elect the makeup of the re mainder of the new administration Icabinet, Mr. Taft will ask him to ap prove of Myron T. Herrick, formet governor of Ohio, as secretary of thi treasury. This fact can be stated at Q coming from authoritative sources Before Mr. Taft offered the treasury portfofllio to Representative Theodore A. Burton of Ohio, he was seriously considering Herrick for the place Now Herrick is the approved man foi s the job. The selection of Knox as secretary of state is of vast significance in that it will probably mean that most of the men now in the cabinet who have figured as great Roosevelt supporters will lose out in the fina- framing of the personnel of the Taft cabinet. The president-elect is frank in his statement that he will depend on the counsel of 'Knox more than on the advice of any other member. This Is taken to mean that the chances of Pinchot being secretary of agriculture and Garfield being secre tary of the interior are reduced to a minimum. W'hen Mr. Knox arrives here within the next week 'Mr. Taft will submit to him for his inspection and approval the following cabinet list: 'Secretary of state-Philander C. Knox of 'Pennsylvania. Secretary of the treasury-Myron T. Herrick of Ohio. A.ttorney general-George Wicker sham of New York. 'Secretary of war--Oharles Magoon, 'former governor of Cuba.

STANDARD OIL TO FIGHT FINE BRIEF OF CORPORATION IS FILED IN COURT. I TRIED TO FIND RATE Claim is Made That the Company Did All Within Its Power to Ascertain i Correct Rate, and that Fine Should Not Lay Against It. WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.-The 'Standard Oil company's brief in the proceedings of the United States against that company on the charge of accepting rebates from the Chica go and Alton railroad, in which the United States court for the northern district of Illinois imposed a fine of $29,240,000 was today filed in the su. preme court of the United States. The case comes before Lhe court on a petition by the government for a writ of certerorai bringing it up for review of the decision of the United States circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit, by` which the district court's decision was reversed. The brief antagonizes the petition and this opposition is based principally on the ground that the law does not author ize a review by the supreme court on any judgment of the circuit court of appeals in a criminal case by which a writ of error of the defendant is sustainled and disposed of by revers ing the judgment and sentence of the trial court. It is contended that In a case of this character a writ of cer teorari is equivalent to a writ of error and' that "the policy of the law is against the review of a judgment in favor of the accused in a criminal case. at the instance of the govern ment." It is pointed out that while 6 cents was the lawful rate on petroleum on all rates from Chicago to East, St. Louis except from the stations at East Chicago, Hammond, Ind., and Whiting or other switching points in Indiana from the point that the gov ernment contends that the railway was required to charge 28 cents per hundred or three times the Chicago rate and that therefore the Standard company, which shipped from the su burb' of Whiting at the Chicago rate was properly mulcted by the district court in the sum of $29,000,000 for not shipping at and paying a prohibi tive rate of three times as much as the Chicago rate. Contention is made that due effora was made on behalf of the Standard company' to discover, the legal rate and it is urged that the company should not be held responsible for its failure in that request.
