It did not declare the grazing of sheep to be a crime, nor make any reference thereto, but declared that whatever the executive prohibited should be pun ishable. There was no way by which a person examining a statute could conclude that the act referred to was criminal. The executive officer by the statute was allowed to define and determine the crimes, which, accord ing to all the authorities is a legisla tive affair. The United States District Court concluded that there could be no crimes except those created, expressly defined, and penalized by an act of Congress, and that the indictment could not be sustained. Effect of Prohibition Law on Saloon Lease.—Property was leased for occu pation as a saloon, and not otherwise. Before the expiration of the lease the sale of intoxicants was prohibited by law. The lessor refused to receive a surrender of the premises and excuse the lessee from further rent, but pro posed to allow their usages for other than saloon purposes. The lease pro vided against no such contingency as arose. The landlord could not have terminated the lease because the ten ant would not or could not sell intox icants. If the law still bound the land lord, the tenant also was bound. Even if the passage of the law were deemed a destruction of the premises, it could afford the tenant no relief, as in that event he would be still liable for rent In O'Byrne vs. Henley, 50 Southern He porter, 83, the Alabama Supreme Court held that, the liability and loss having lawfully fallen upon the tenant, there it should remain.

Special to The News. Jackson, Dec. G.—Congressman J. W. Collier left Sunday night Washington to resume his duties in Congress. He will reach the national capital in time for the reading of President Taft's for message Tuesday morning. In regard to the troubles in Nica ragua, and the relation of the United States thereto, Mr. Collier said: "It seems to me that this is the psy chologlcal moment to give Nicaragua a good spanking, and that such a pro-1 cedure by our government would have a very salutary effect. "Certain it Is after the Panama ea-j nal is completed, we are likely to have recurrent troubles with the Central'all American countries, and especially the professional revolutionists and troublemakers on the isthmus.

In State vs. Day, 121 Northwestern Reporter, 011, his contention was that, although he had gone through the ceremony usual in taking an oath, he had neglected to raise his hand. It having been con vincingly shown that appellant knew the girl was less than 18, the fact that he knew the application contained the statement that she was over that age, and the fact that he signed it deliber ately knowing it to contain such state ment, dispensed with an exact follow ing of the statutory form of oath. The Minnesota Supreme Court decided that,, the particular formality never having been regarded as important the essential thing was that the party taking the oath should go through some declaration or formality before the officer which indicates to him that the appellant consciously asserts or af firms the truth of the fact to which he testifies. Conviction affirmed. Power to Prohibit Purchases From Intoxicated Seller.—An ordinance pro hibiting junk dealers from purchasing from intoxicated persons was attacked in Grossman vs. City of Indianapolis, 88 Northeastern Reporter, 945, as be ing an undue restraint of trade. The Indiana Supreme Court, upholding the ordinance, remarked .that the asserted right of a sober man to buy of another, while in a state of intoxication, proper ty which an ungovernable and insa tiable appetite may have prompted him to steal, and would likely induce him to sacrifice on any terms, is so ab horrent to a sense of fair dealing as to Just a Minute With The Base Ball Doctor By

The special inclusion in city charters of power to legislate against such conduct is to enable them to make reasonable regulations rather than to restrict that power, Punishment of Habitual Criminals.— The constitutionality of the law pro viding increased penalties for habitual criinals was assailed in State vs. Le Pitre, 103 Pacific Reporter, 27. The Washington Supreme Court decided that while the habitual criminal stat ute was a thing of modern creation, and there are many rules of law which seems likely that he may seem inconsistent with its pur pose and procedure adopted to com pass it, it is nevertheless sound in principle and sustained by Aside from the offender and his vic tim, there is always another party con cerned In every crime committed—the state—and it does no violence to any constitutional guaranty for the state to rid itself of depravity when its ef forts to reform have failed. The act is not ex post facto. It does not deny the right of trial by jury. It does not put the offender twice in jeopardy. It does not Inflict a doub'e punishment for the same offense, or inflict a cruel or unusual punishment, or impose a penalty for crime committed outside of the state. It merely provides an in creased punishment for the last of fense. The spirit of the law is in keeping with the acknowledged power of tlie Legislature to provide imum and maximum term within which the trial court may exercise its discretion in fixing sentence, taking itno cosideration, as it should always, the character of the person as well as the probability of reformation; or the Legislature may take away all discre tion and fix a penalty absolute. reason. a rain (few months and we will be doing a heel and toe dance towards Hamper Park, All the big league teams will train in the South. there like a duck and have training out at our park.
