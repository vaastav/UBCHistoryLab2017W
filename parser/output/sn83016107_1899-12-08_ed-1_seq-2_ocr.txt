' LEG A LIZE TH EPR IMA KIES. We understand that strong efforts are being made to defeat the proposed legislation to legalize the primaries. One of the subtifuges being used is that no law can be passed which would be constitutional. Another argument is, that the cumbersome methods would entail too much ex pense. As an answer to the first argu ment we can only say that it is simply ridiculous to say that there can be no constitutional law enacted to control this important branch of our election .machinery. Section 43 of Article 3of the constitution expressly says that, “The General Assembly shall pass Laws necessary for the preservation of the purity of Elections.” This should forever put to rest any argu ments about such technicalities. Speaking of technicalities, we should like to digress for a moment and call attention to the fact that whenever a person is fairly beaten in any encoun ter he will always attempt to entangle himself by resorting to technicalities. It is the expiring death wail of the worsted combatant. In regard to the expense of a legal primary, we would say that it is for the purpose of saving money for the candidates, that the passage of the act is urged. If bribery and corruption is prohibited it will then be possible for a poor man to be an aspirant for political honors. The only expense he would be subjected to would be to pay his pro-rata of the cost of judges, clerks, etc. Now the way things are run, he must be a man of means to stand all the levies which are put upon him. It has indeed gotten so bad in many cases that more than the salary of the office sought has to be expended to gain the prize. There has not as yet, been one single convincing argument advanced against legalizing the primaries. The people want it, and are going to have it, and if anyone sets himself up against the will of the people and favors illegal primaries he will have to take the consequences. THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. On Tuesday Presideut McKinley sent to Congress his annual message. It is a much mbre elaborate oue than many of its predecessors, containing as it does over 25,000 words. It touch es very fully upon almost every im portant public event. Its leading features are the recommendations for the of the gold standard and the regulation of trusts, the dis cussion of the situation in the Philip pines and Cub-., the proposed plan of government for Puerto Rico, the ne cessity of legislation for Hawaii and Alaska, the exposition of our policy in China, which, though brief, is perti nently stated, and the President’s de fense of his order amending Ihe civil service act. In opening his message, Mr. Mc- Kinley dwells upon the prosperity of the United States, showing that the combined exports and imports for 1899 are the largest in our history. The exports of agricultural products amount to to $784,770,142, while Die aggregate of manufactured products is $339,593 140. The receipts of the Government, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, will exceed the expenditures for the liscnl year, which will end on June, 30,1900, and a surplus of $40,000,000 is anticipated. The Treasury is in good condition and on December 1 held $239,744,905 in gold coin and bullion. In fact, as the President points out, confidence pre vails, there is increased activity in in dustry and the present seems to be a good time for Congress to enact finan cial legislation. “Our receipts,” says the President, “now equaj our expenditures, and de ficient revenues no longer create alarm. Let us remove the only re maining cause by conferring the full and necessary power on the Secretary of the Treasury, and impose upon him the duty to uphold the present gold standard and preserve the coins of the two metals on a parity with each other, which is the repeatedly declar ed policy of the United States.” The President recommends that to "sup port the existing gold standard 9 * * the Secretary of the Treasury be given additional power and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds * * *on long and short time, as the conditions mav require.” The Presi deut further recommends such changes in the national banking act as will make it more effective in pro viding needful additions to the circu lation iu time of emergency. Larger agricultural production, ho declares, calls for an increased volume of money supply. The President defends his position in the Philippines iu strong terms. He says : “The islands were ceded by the Government of Spain, which had been in undisputed possession of them for centuries. They were accepted not merely by our authorized commission ers in Paris, under the direction of the Executive, but by the constitu tional and well-considered action of the representatives of the people of the United States iu both houses of Congress. I had e very reason to be lieve, and I still believe, that this transfer of sovereignty was in accord ance with the wishes and aspirations of the great mass of the Filipino peo ple.” From the earliest moment, de clares the President, no opportunity was lost of assuring the people of tbe islands "of our ardent desire for their welfare and of the intention of this Government to do everything possi ble to advance their interests.” It is claimed that the “sinister ambition of a few Filipino leaders created a situa tion full of embarassment to ns and most grievous in its consequences to them.” There can now be no doubt as to what the conclusion of the President is in regard to these islands. He un doubtedly wants to hold them per manently. “The future government of the Philippines rests with Congress,” he asserts. “Few graver responsibilities have ever been confided to us. If we accept them in a spirit worthy of our race and traditions, a great oppor tunity comes with them, The islands lie under the shelter of our flag, and are ours byfevery title of law and equity. They cannot be abandoned. If we desert them we leave them at once to anarchy and finally to barbar ism. We fling them, a golden apple of discord, among the rival powers. Their rich plains and valleys would be the scenes of endless strife and bar barism.” Mr. McKinley scorns the “uggestion that we renounce our authority over the islands and give them independence, maintaining a oro'ectorate over them. “Our flag,” he says, “has never waved over any community but in blessing.” The Filipinos will soon recognize the fact that it "has not lost its gift of bene diction in its world-wide journey to their shores.” in regard to Cuba, the Preside t declares that the pledge of independ ence made by Congress is of the high est honorable obligation and must be sacredly kept. “Our mission, to ac complish which we took up the wager of battle, is not to be fulfilled,” how ever, “by turning adrift any loosely framed commonwealth to face the vi cissitudes which too often attend weaker States, whose natural wealth and abundant resources are offset by the incongruities of their political organization and the recurring oc casions for internal rivalries to sap their strength and dissipate their energies.” The policy of the Admin istration is to fit the Cubans “for a regenerated existence by enforcing the supremacy of Jaw and justice,” and to “take every rational step to aid the people of Cuba to attain to that plane of self-conscious respect and self-reliant unity which fits an enlightened community for self-gov ernment.” There is a remote sugges tion of annexation in the President’s remark that the “destinies of Cuba are iu some rightful form and manner irrevocably linked with our own, whether those ties shall be organic or conventional.” Possibly the lamest portion of the message is the condemnation of the trusts. Every right-thinking man knows that they are mere creatures of the Republican party, fostered by legislation of their own contrivance. We think that if we had been sincere he should have frankly upheld them as Senator Hanna did iu his cam paign speeches in Ohio this fall. After recommending a system of government for Puerto Rico along the lines of Secretary Root’s report, the President says: “The markets of the United States should be opened up to the island’s products. Our plain duty is to abolish all customs tariffs betweeu the United States aaid Puerto Rico, and give the latter’s products free access to our markets.” The President declares that his civil service order was justifiable and has strengthened the merit system. He commends the Nicaragua canal scheme; deprecates lynchings iu the United States; speaks favorably of the Paris Exposition; suggests certain changes, for the benefit of widows, in rhe pension laws: advocates early leg islation for Hawaii and Alaska; re commends liberal appropriations for the maintenance and improvement of the navy; commends the work of the Peace Conference at The Hague; points out certain matters which mav cause friction between the United States and 'turkey, and refers to the good relations between the United States, G rmany and Great Britain. In regal'd to the lynching of abens in the United S'ates he says "thecon tingency has arisen for action by Con gress iu the direction of conferring upon the Federal courts juris diction iu this class of international cases where the ultimate responsi bility of the Federal Government may be involved.” 

SCHLEY’S COURT MARTIAL. From a well-informeJ correspon dent we obtain the following: Imme diately on Secretary Long’s return from the West on November 19 he was called on by Admiral Crownin shield, who insisted that a court of inquiry or court-martial should be ordered for Admiral Schley before he left this country. Mr. Long was in formed by the chief of the Bureau of Navigation that the Admiral's orders had been purposely held up until the Secretary returned, and it was assert ed that recent newspaper attacks on the Administration had been inspired and encouraged by Schley, and es pecially those directed against the Secretary and the Department. Par ticular attention was drawn to Gen eral Agnus’s recent letter. Other in stances were shown where, as was al leged, Admiral Schley had been using his influence to prompt criticism of the Administration. Secretary Long at first was inclined to heed the ad vice, and was, we are told, about to proceed to the President with a suggestion that a court be ordered for Schley. He was persuaded by As sistant Secretary Allen that the better policy would be to permit Admiral Schley to leave. It was shown that political reasons must be considered; that Schley was very strong with the public; that a court now would arouse his friends and make trouble for the President and result in a discussion before Congress that would briug the Navy into an unpleasant position. There is no doubt that ali this trans pired. Wo are reliably informed that no charges are yet on file at the Department against Admiral Schley. We are told, however, that Capt. liobley D. Evans has drawn charges against him and has held them for some time, but so far has not pre sented them to the Secretary, though they have been shown to sympathi zers in the attack on Admiral Schley. It remains to be seen whether they will be presented to the Department. —Army and Nary Journal.

Washington, Dec., 4.—Hon. J. D. Richard son, of Tennessee, who received the Democra tic nomination for Speaker, after one of the longest caucuses ever hold, got the vote of every Democratic memberof the House today. He was not, of course, elected; the Republicans having the most votes, elected Representative Henderson Speaker, adopted the oid Reed rules, but Mr. Richardson will be the Demo cratic floor-icndcr of the House during: the life of the Fifty-Sixth Congress. There may be more showy and brilliant men on the Demo cratic side of the House, but that be will make a shrewd and safe leader is conceedcd by all. His shrewdness would have beeu shown by the manner in which be conducted bis cam paign for the nomination of Speaker, had it not been well established long ago. He re ceived no warmer congratulations on his suc cess than those extended by bis throe rivals for the honor. Leaving Roberts and bis polygamy entirely out of the question, the position taken by the Democrats in the first scrap of the session, which occurred when objection was raised to the swearing in of Roberts, that the House had no right Co go behind the official returns and deny a man a seat, when ho presents proper credent! als, whs right, but right can’t win when a majority is determined tp do the other thing, it Roberts cannot clear himself of the ohargo of having violated the law, there wiil be few if any, objections on the Demo cratic side, to his being denied a seat, but it is wrong to declare him guilty before bis case is fairly investigated. Mr. McKinley’s long message, —one of the longest over sent to Congrcs—was. not sent in today, owing to the early adjournment of both Senate and House as a mark of respect to the late Vice-President Hobart. It will go In to morrow, and then the real business of the session of Congress will begin. The Demo crats were never in a more aggress.ve mood, and “hot times’’ are ahead for tho Republican majority in both Senate and House. The attention of Senators is being called to tho fact that Gov. Stone had no constitutional right to appoint Mr. Quay to the Senate, after tho legislature adjourned, without electing his successor. The State Constitution of Pennsyl vania. expressly provides that vacancies in the United States Senate Khali only be Ailed by the Legislature. A number ol inlluontial Pennsylvanians ere in Washington, working against tho seating of Quay on personal grounds, against both precedent and law. One ot those is ex-Representative Sowden, who said on the subject: “The question should not be made a partisan one but each Senator, re gardless of his politic* or bis perso ial friend ship for Mr. Quay, should vote a< a conscien tious, impartial and unright Judge, and de cide it according to its merits and the dictates of his own conscience, under bis official oath. I f this be done, there can be no question of the I result. Gov. Stone’s unlawful appointment has not a single merit to support it.” 1 That our pension laws arc in need of revision. everybody knows, but when they will get It, or whether the revision will make them better or worse, la a house of another color. The .Secretary and Assistant Secretary of the In terior, and the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner of Pension*, have testified be lore a sub-committee, or lbeSena to Committee on Pensions, that a revision of the laws should be made. and ed that it be done by a commission. A National Com mis.-ion that is rea.ly non partisan, wop •! be p rarity, indeed, although there are mu**}’ so called. Representative i-mith, of Kentucky, who wss recently acting Charman of the Kentucky Democratic State Committee, thinks the legal contest In that otate, depends upon the viev/ the Court of Appeals lakes "f tissue ballots. Hethinksthoao ballots were illegal, and knows that the}’ were used extensively in the Rvpub i can border counties, to make sure that, the ‘•floaters 11 voted as they were paid to vote. He sa>s if tne tissue ballots an* thrown out as illegal,Goebel wil-have e. plurality ct from 2,OUiHo 10,000. Mr. .Smith says he doesn 1 ! oeli vo there will beany troubi* in th- ; r .ale, no matter what the Anal decision may be. Mr. McKiniey is in a somewhat disagreeable predicament, by reason of his desire to pu>h bis friend, and old-family physician, Ocn. Leonard Wood, ahead In the regular army. He told Oeu. Wood, some months ago, that he in tended making him a Brigadier General in the Regular Army, and it leaked out. There was a flood of protest from the friends of the line otliccrs-many of them influential Republicans who objected to having them jumped by a staff surgeon, with tho rank of Captain. Mr. McKinley then tried to satisfy Gen. Wood with something else, but he have it that way, preferring to stand pat on the original promise. This was the principal reason for Gen. Wood being ordered to Washington at this time, and not the withdrawal of troops from his District in Cuba, as announced.
