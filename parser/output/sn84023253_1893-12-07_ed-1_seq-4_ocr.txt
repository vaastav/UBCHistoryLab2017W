HAWAII,. ,( The Hawaiian situation remains unchanged. A9 Minister Willis rath er pompously declares, "the whole question is now in abeyance, and nuthing that newspapers can say or do will alter thestatementone iota." We presume the press of the country will bear up fairly well under this blow. Willis was sent on by the ad ministration to restore the mon archy, but he repoits that "con tingencies" have arisen which induce him to await further instructions rom Washington before proceeding to put Liliuokalani on her throne again. Meantime the provisional government holds the fort. It may be that these "contingencies" will develop so fully as to change admin istration's mind on the Hawaiian question. The country is anxious to know just what is to be dune on these islands, where American inter ests are so largely involved, and a good deal may depend on the next move that is made. DECLINED WITH THANKS. The hue and cry raised all over the country against the nomination of Van Alcn as ambassador to Italy in return (or his fiity-thousand-doilar contribution to the democrat ic campaign fund, has had its effect. At least Mr. Yan Alen has written the president, declining to accept the position, after being confirmed by the senate; and the protest of the people against so open a political bargain must be regarded as having a great deal to do with Mr, Van Alen's declining. The gentleman in question does not deny that he gave largely to the campaign fund, and says he was im pelled so to do by a bt lief that "a continuance of republican supremacy would be a hindrance to national progress," etc. However well or poorly founded that belief may be, the sending of Mr. Van Alen to Italy as our representative was felt to be, nder the circumstances, by leading lights in his own party, a very dis creditable proceeding; and it is a matter for congratulation that the appointee has taken the hint and declined with thanks. The tempest stirred up by this ap pointment should prevent the con signation of similar bargains by either party. THE 

MESSAGE. President Cleveland's message was read to congress on Monday of this week, and it takes eight columns of small type to get the document out into the light where the public can see what there is in it. The message contains suggestions and rccommend ationson matters of vital importance to the nation, bnt nothing especially new is set forth. Considerable in terest was felt in w hat Mr. Cleveland might say about Hawaii, but his al lusion to this question is compara tively brief. No definite action hav ing been taken as yet, he promises to communicate again with congress when further advices are received by him. The following summary of the points in the message is taken from the Boston Journal, and will give our readers a fair idea of the presi dent's views on national issues: The message opens by saying that while our iorciii relations hnve not been free from perplexity, no cnibarrassine situation remains Hint will not yield to mirness or justiee. Admiral Stanton's salute to Admiral Mello is disavowed. Minister Ivirnn ol Chile is rebuked for re civing tinsuecesslul revolutionists into his ollieial residence. Tilde lms been a little friction with certnin ol the South American countries, sut u is an riKin now. French aggression in Liberia is repro sated. The hone is expressed that the Nicar agua Cunal project inny be accomplished aiuler American auspiecs. It enlarges upon the "Impolicy of en- tannlinii loreifin alliances," as instanced in the United btateg-Sitmoan-Briush pro tectorate of Samoa. It recommends that congress make recognition to Spain lor the gift ot the caravels. Turkey is notified that American mis sionariea must and shall be protected. It gives a recapitulation of the Hawaiian mutter, and stales thut the president is satisfied Iron) Mr. blount's report that the constitutional govern ment of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of Minister Stevens .mid through theintimidationol armed United Slate forces. Minister Willis has been ordered to restore the monarchy as far ns lies in his power, It approves of the settlement of d.plomutie disputes by arbitration and of a plan of raising the grade of our en voys to ambussudor to ureut Urituin, France, Italy and Germany. It recommends a recast of the consular laws that the service may be made more efficient. It summarises the report of the secre tary of the treasury and gives coinuge and bank statistics. The deficit in the treasury Nov. 1 was $28,000,000. The effect of silver renenl.in the opinion of the president, is salutary and far reaching, but it is impossible to say pre cisely what changed conditions will be brought about or what supplementary legislation will be essentiul. We must "turn awny from alluring expedients." The president wants authority to invite an international monetary conference when there is a fail prospect of agree ment. A more efficient national quarantine is recommended. As there can be no more Indian out breaks, the redistribution of the army is recommended. It recommends the abolition of the fee system ns applicable to the compensa tion ol United States attorneys, marshals, clerks and commissioners. A more sensible and business-like organization of the postmaster general's department is recommended. The president is in lavor ol consistent naval development, but congress must consider the depleted treasury and be careful in making appropriations. He avers that there arc thousands 01 fraudulent pensioners on the rolls. The abolition of Indiun tribal relations is urged, and the allotment of land in severalty. Laws for the preservation of the for ests are especially recommended. t he gratituous distribution 01 seeds dv the agricultural department is costly and of little a vail ; it should be stopped. The president is more than ever con vinced of the incalculable benefits con ferred bv the civil service law. Tnriff pledges must be redeemed. While adhering to the principle of "revenue onlv." a "discriminating care must be exercised in the distribution of such duties." Free raw material is urged. The Wilson bill cordially recommended. It will be remembered that Col. Ainsworth, formerly of Woodstock, was, in common with three other government officials, held responsi ble by the courts for the collapse of the Old Ford theatre building at Washington last June, by which sev eral lives were lost, and an indict ment for manslaughter followed. The district court of appeals has just sustained a dernurreroffered by Ains- worth's counsel, and declared the in dictment against him to be fatally defective. This sends the case back to the lower court, which will dis charge Ainsworth and his associates. It is exceedingly doubtful if anything further is heard from thiscase, which, at the time, created such a stir. The demon of the liquor traffic is furious when attacked, and hits hard in revenge when opportunity offers. The city of Ilazelhurst, Miss., was on Monday the scene of a brutal murder by representatives of the liquor interest. In revengefor Mayor Williamson's earnest fight against illegal sales of the ardent he was as saulted on the streets in broad day light and so seriously hurt that he died three hours after. Acts of this sort 6trve to strengthen the opposi tion to the evil traffic and to bring its devotees under, condemnation. The candidates for lieutenant-gov ernor are being mentioned by the state press and we note that the Burlington Free Press names Hon. Henry C. Bates of St. Johnsbury, in response to an editorial in our St. Johnsbury contemporary, who an nounces "that St. Johnsbury has a cinch on the office next time round." Mr. Bates has served the state well in the past and he has a host of friends in Vermont who believe that he would make an excellent lieutenant-governor. Gov. Lcwelling of Kansas has a great scheme in miud the construc tion of a gulf and inter-state rail road, which will enable Western farmers to carry their products across the Atlantic "at a saving of millions of dollars annually." Ten states are to be asked to aid in build ing the line, which will extend from the Brit it-h possessions to the Gulf of Mexico. This is a gigantic enter prise, the successful issue of which, while not impossible, is likely to be delayed for some time yet. Another official head has dropped into the basket, nt St. Albans, and C. S. Forbes is superseded by A. L Weeks as deputy collector of internal revenue. The new appointee is a wide awake business man of St. Albans, and will muke an excellent deputy in Uncle Sara's revenue de partment. The railroad town has yet to be provided with a change of postmasters, and when this is done the "offensive partisans" in that vicinity will have been pretty much taken care of. Isn't it time, alter recent ex peiiences with outside financiers, for lakes like Brewer to find Vermont unprofitable soil to cultivate? Burlington Clipper. It would seem so, certainly. And if we rtmember correctly, the Bur ton people diil not bile ui Brewer's bait so extensively as to muke his profits bewildcringly large. At least one republican postmaster the official at Springfield, Mass. leaves his office under most favorable auspices. He has resigned as post master only to step into the state treasurer's office to which he was elected last month.
