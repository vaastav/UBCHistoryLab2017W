Millcdgeville advices state that Provisional Governor Johnson, of Georgia, has been instructed by the Presi dent, as had previously been other Southern Provisional Governore, to continue to hold his office until specially advised from Washington to vacate it, and also not to ln-Mie certificates of olectlon to tho genllemeu elected to Congr *?? >n bis State. The two houses of Congress will reassemble to-day, alter their four day-' vacation, and decisive action will no doubt H>>on bo taken ou some of tho Hevoral import ant unroots already introduced. In consideration of thoso tacts, aud in anticipation of the goneral course which tho majority of tho members will pursue with regard to the leading measures of tho radical programme, we give from one of our corres pondents in tho national capital a comprehen sive review of the present political situation there, wtth a statement of the feeling among the republi can Congressmen generally, aud some indications of their future programme. Already the conservative republi cans show Kigas of regret for their haste In rdshing through the House of Representatives the resolution In stituting a special committee to determine whether the Southern State* are entitled to representation. This resolution ha* not yet been di*i>osed of by the Senate, whose ? lion upon it is still involved in doubt. Its sup liorler* am smguine that it will be adopted, while its opponent* feel equally confident that It will not. Per hape to day, or at{lhe furthest n few days, will determine. A history of the incubation of this resolution, and ac count* of interviews which Its author, Mr. Thaddeus Stevens, and Senator Sumner, recently had wtth the Pr<xidei?l, nre also given by our correspondent. Mr. Cbauuii'y M. Dep-w, Secretary of State of New York, has derliued the position of Minister to Japan, to which be wan some lime ago appointed by the President. From -t Domingo ws have advice* dated to November 7. The existing government Is at a loss to know whether the Dominican republic is truly an independent American Slate or nHuply an apanage of Prance. A Hsini official mooting of the Dominican Congress had taken place on the Ud nil., when the expediency of sending another envoy to Washington, with tho proffer of a naval depot on the bay of Manxanilla as a free gin to the (Juited Slates, wac discussed at length, but It was Anally decided that uo step should be taken in the matter if General Haes, the recently elected President, arrived at Uie capital as soon as expected. The new official, though elected through foreign Influence, enjoys con siderable popularity, and will accord all privileges to emigrants and settlers. The people of St. Domingo and th*ir repr 'mutative* In Congreee complain bitterly of the uoaduct of the United States towards their country, and orgs that the Monroe Doctrine has been trampled upon by the Union government, "whoee Secretary of State," they allege, "endorsed the right of Spain to extinguish an American republic.'' It Is suggested that if the Dominican republic were to obtain national recognition by the United States it might not even now be too lata for the oountry to sustain its attitude as part and parcel of tho Amort can system.

Special services in honor of the festival of the Imma culate Conception took plaoe yesterday in 8L Patrick's Catholic cathedral, Mulberry street, la the presence of a numerous congregation.? Au eloquent aermon appro priate^ the occasion was preached by Archbishop Mc Closkey. In the Church of the Holy Trinity, Brooklyn, last evoning addresses were delivered by Bishop Leigh, of Arkansas, and Bishop Potter, relative to the Protestant Episcopal Freedmon's Aid Society, In which its objects ware explained and appeals were made in its behalf. The objects are tho conversion and instruction of the freed men In the South. Impressive religious sorvices in honor of all who fell In defonce of the republic during the late rebollion took place last evening In tho Tabernacle chnrch, corner of Broadway and Thirty-fourth street, in the presence of a congregation which crowded overy portion the build in >. Thore wor ' musical exercises of a superior charac ter, and a sermon recounting the heroism, sufferings and virtues of | the fallen, and sketching 'tho grand results which will follow to the nation from their devotion and sacr flee, was preached by the pastor of tho church, tho Rev. Dr. Thompson. Tho Rev. Dr. Lebon, of Nashville, Missionary Secretary of tho MethodUt Episcopal Church South, preached yes t-rday forenoon in Cooper Institute. Tho reverend gen tleman, at the commencement of his sermon, alluded to the results of our late war, but disavowed any disposi tion to touch on political isir.es during his dlscourso. H ? stated that he had held his present position of Mis sionary Secretary for tho last twouty yoars, but that now the organization to which be belonged found Itself utterly poworless to continue its missionary work, as all Its treasure consisted of two hundred thousand dollars in rebel money. A collection was talon up in tho audienoe for the beneQt of the mission. Rov. W. W. Clayton, who has recently been on a tour among the freedmen's schools in the South, delivered a discourse last evening in the Twentieth street Univer salis! church, giving an account of his visit ami urging the nec\ sity of lii? particular denomination establishing educational Institutions for tho froed negroes.

Another association of German veterans, composed of Genu iQ3 who served in the Union armies during the late war, was organized yesterday at a meet in* held at the ?teubea House. There are now altog ithor .seven of these Gorman veteran societies in the city, all of which are united in a veteran Union organization. The five story building No. 36 Park street and a frame stable in the roar wore destroyed by a (Ire which broke ojt between nine and ten o'clock last night Tin total loss is estimated at between thirty and forty thousand dollars.

Tub Constitutional Amendment Kkn 'ttjcst ? Slavkrt Declared Abolished. ? We ptibl.shed yesterday, from Louisville, a some what startling despatch on the slavery question. It is known that Kentucky, as a loyal slave State, was exempted from the emancipation proclamations of President Lincoln, and that her local authorities have held fast to their cherished institution notwithstanding it has been rendered practically worthless by the damaging effects of the war. Our military commanders have thus had more trouble about slavery in Kentucky than with rebel guerillas ; but it appears that Judge John ston. of the Jefferson county Circuit Court, has cut the gordian knot with a single stroke of his pen. Before his court, in the case of the Com monwealth of Kentucky versus Major General J. M. Palmer, for aiding a slave to escape, Judge Johnston "dismissed the indictment on th? ground that the requisite number of States had ratified the constitutional amendment abol ishing slavery before the indictment, and that therefore all criminal and penal acts of the Kentucky Legislature relative to slavery were null and of no effect" This Is Judge Johnston's short method of settling a knotty question. Following up his j decision, General Palmer has issued a pro clamation declaring that slavery has ceased in Kentucky, and advising the colored people to apply to the courts for redress if the public conveyances, in disregard of their rights to travel, are denied them, provided they con form to reasonable regulations. Now, making all allowances for the slaves in Kentucky lost and set free by the operations of the war, it is probable that between Judge Johnston and General Palmer two hundred thousand have been turned loose in a single day, and that a hundred thousand of them, in order to teat their new gift of freedom, are now on their travels, heading for the Ohio river. Kentucky, in brief, may be considered as turned upside down by this concurrent action of Judge Johnston and General Palmer. In point of fhet, we apprehend they are a little too fast; for, if we are not mistaken, the con stitutional amendment lacks yet one State of the required three-fourths of all the States Iowa having ratified it by only one house be fore the final adjournment of her last Legislature. Practically, however, it will be useless to at tempt to repair the work of abolition done in Kentucky; for slavery in that State, though abolished by mistake, is dead and gone. Cali fornia and Oregon will noon settle the ques tion. Where Am the Metallic Three Cbwt Pieces ?? The cent and two cent coins are as plentiftil as blanks in a lottery; but where, the copper and nickel three cent pieces are stowed away Is a mystery that probably do one but a coin broker or a Jewish miser can solve.

Th? two houses or uongreas, arcor a reooas from Wednesday last, reasaemble for business to-day. We presume that the leading queatton before the Senate frill be the joint resolution of Thaddeua Stevens, from the Houae, in refer ence to the excluded Southern Statea. That resolution, adopted in the republican joint oaucus preparatory to the organization, was passed in the House on Monday last, under the previous qnostion, by a vote of 133 to 36? more than two-thirds in the affirmative. It provides that a joint committee of nine members of the House and six of the Senate shall be appointed to inquire and report whether any of the lately insurgent States are now entitled to be represented in Congress, and that Until said report shall have been made no member from any of said States shall be admitted into either house, and that the com mittee shall have leave at any time to make their report. This sweeping resolution thus rushed through the House under a suspension of the rules and by the enforcemen t of the proviojja question, before the reception of the Presi dent's Message, involved, first, an insult to the Executive, and, secondly, a violation of the constitution of the United States. The House, under the whip and spur of that violent radi cal, Stevens, declared by its action that it cared nothing for the views and explanations of the President in regard to his Southern policy; that the House flatly repudiated that policy, and wished Mr. Johnson so to understand it, whatever he might have to say in his Message. Had the Senate been guided according to the wishes of Mr. Thaddeua Stevens, this offen sive resolution would doubtless have beon hurried through that body; but, as there is no previous question in the Senate, it was thought best by Messrs. Sumner, Wade, Wilson and Company to lot the subject lie over under the rule, instead of attempting a suspension, and to sit it out and worry tho minority into a surrender. But, to say nothing of the insult levelled at the President by this joint resolution, tho con stitutional question involved had doubtless something to do with the Senate's postpone ment of the subject. The constitution ex pressly declares that "each house shall be the judge of tho elections, returns and qualifica tions of its own members." The intent of this provision is plain enough. It is that tho Sen ate, for instance, in regard to tho qualifications of its members, shall not be subject to a con currence of the House; but that each bouse, in regard to the elections and qualifications of ite members, shall be entirely independent of the other. That such a provision is essential to free inquiry en l legislation on the part of each honso is very clear; asd it is equally clear that j the Stevens resolution, in proposing that both j bouses, acting together, shall determine the i qualifications of the members of oich house, in volves a palpable violstton of the constitution in one of its most important legislative chocks and balances. So perfectly conclus'vo is this simple ntnte- i ment of the casi that it becomes a m-.ttor of some surprise that the republican caucus and the nouse itsolf, under the guidance of such constitutional ignoramuses as Thaddens Ste vens and Henry J. Raymond, should be led, without a remonstrance, into the stupid blunder of this joint resolution. The temptation, how ever, to put this thing in such a shape as to re quiro the President's signature was too strong to be resisted by the radicals. They would compel him thus officially to repudiate his own policy in subscribing to theirs, or they would show up his impotency by passing the resolu tion by a two-thirds rote over his veto. But we suspect that this constitutional difficulty will result in the defeat of Stevens, in a modifi cation of hi* resolution, through the action of the Senate to-day. As It stands President Johnson could not desire a better issue on whioh to appeal from Congress to the people. At any rate, if this resolution is thrust into his face, he has but one alternative, and that is bis constitutional veto. But, as we have already shown to our readers, there was on Wednosday in both houses a perceptible cooling down of the radical spirit for an "irrepressible conflict" since its violent outbreak on Monday. The ?President's Message bad been read to both houses on Tuesday, and its calm and convincing argument* had evidently made a good impres sion. Thus Senator Doolittle was enabled to check the fanatic Sumner, and to bring the Senate by a few well-timed words to a proper friime of mind for a temperate consideration of this Steven* resolution, in the suggestion that it needed an overhauling by the Judiciary Committee. There will probably be this morn ing. in advance of the meeting of the two houses, another republican caucus, nnd a re vision therein of the blundering Stevens reso lution upon which the action of the Senate will be based. Thaddeus Stevens, in the last Congross, in W* gold bills and other absurdities, showed that he was too visionary and headstrong in bis notions to be the leader of the House; but in this joint resolution, proposing to take from each house its constitutional right to judge of the elections of its own members, and to make the President a consenting party to the trac sec tion, be eclipsss all his past achievements in folly and stupidity. It is to be boped that the Speaker, in his report of his standing commit tees to-day, will place Mr. Stevens in a position where he may be usefal without being a elog upon the business of the House. On the main question, this aforesaid joint resolution, we anticipate a good result from the "sober second thought" of both houses. British Hcmanttt and British Practice.? Accounts received through British channels by way of Hallfox confirm the statement that up wards of two thousand insurgent negroes have already been executed. From a report made by the officer in command it appears that many had been put to death without trial or investi gation of any kind, there being, It is coolly added, "no time for such forms." During our rebellion the English journals were filled with indignation articles on the barbarity with whioh rebel prisoners were treated by the North, said barbarity consisting in the foot that we invari ably seat back our exchanged prisoners fot and aleak, instead of lean and hungry as (key Ml late o?r hands, and that ia no Instance was a prfcooor p?i to death by qp anises eonvleted of Ottawa i^uatlllatils by the military oede, ttl thai would have (named the punishment I drfltffh by Ws own oBesc* We aonli desire \ to tpttr natter at (hi *?d injuatioe 4>t the coarse pursued towards as by British sta^men tad journals daring the late war than the pwaent proceedings of the Jamaica authorities. Conpled frith the atrocities per petrated during the Indian mutiny, they should be sufficient to shut their mouths forever on questions of comparative humanity. At all events, after such acts, they will not prevent the world arriving at the conclusion that when their passions are aroused and their interests assailed there are no people capable of more dreadful deeds of savagory than the so-called humanitarians and philanthropists of Great Britain. The War la Peal*. We published in yesterday's Hiiuld an an count of the proceedings of the Fenian Senate at their session in this city. From this it ap pears that Mr. President O'Mahony and Mr> Secretary of the Treasury Bardey Killlan have been deposed from their several offices. We do not exactly understand how they do things in the realm of Fenia, but it would be no Hibernicism to say that they seem either to do nothing at all, or make sweeping demon strations or blunders whenever they attempt to do anything. No doubt these proceedings will excite considerable wonder among the Fenian Brotherhood all over the world, and it may be amusing, as well as instructive, to speculate a little in regard to the causes which have led to this hubbub in Fenia. So long as the Fenian leaders kept quietly transacting their business In humble and unob trusive quarters they were but little noticed by the publio, and excited no feeling of jeal ousy among other aspirants for Fe nian honors and emoluments. But when they occupied a sumptuous palaoe in a fashionable and conspicuous quarter of the city for thair headquarters they at once attracted the attention of the public and awak ened the envy of their rivals. In other words, when they left off drinking superb Irish whis key in Dunne street at ten cents a glass, and became addicted to pony brandy in Union square at seventy-five cents a rider, the wbole apparatus of the Fenian concern collapsed and the inevitable explosion occurred. It was all well enough for the Fenian leaders to gather in money trom all sections of the con tinent for the attainment of a legitimate ob ject?namely, the liberation of Ireland; but when they aBpired to the grand operation of revolutionizing the entire world and smashing ! up things genoraliy they wont a great deal beyond their capabilities. The little bubble that first .started from the Fenian p'pe expanded gradually until it met the dazzling rays of the sun, and it looksd so be mtifyl in its rainbow hues th.it its blowers coul.l not nsist the temptation to give it an extra gU3t, anl then the radiant gi.jbe burst into thin air. It is a pity that such great movements should bo intrusted to incompetent porsons. Ii was the ens.* in 1848 in regard to tbn Slievegammon fund, when Horace 0'Glrnelr>y became the trustee or recip ient oF a handsome amount of money, of some of which there appears to bo a considerable balance still rom lining unaccounted for. The Irish people in this country open their hearts and their savings bank books whenever an appeal is made to thom in behalf of the green and belovod land of their birth. Credulous to a fault, they aro ready to donate everything they possess that will caiiso the dews of liberty to drop upon the blessed old sod and expand the bloiwoma ot freedom. It is there fore scarcely to bo wondered at that they so frequently become the da pea of sharpers nnd those designing men whoso labors in securing Irish freedom are limited to the amount of money they can make out of the transaction. What the Fenian loaders should hare done before exposing their organi sation to the dangers of the present oollapse was to have made a practical demonstra tion upon the vitals of their hereditary foe, John Bull, by taking Canada. Instead of doing this they hare been palaroring about this and that trifle, assuming tbe Auctions of a mimic government, and have taken the best course in | tho world to fasten tighter the shackles tlmt bind their brethren at home. We believe that this Fenian organisation is about lo be smashed up, and that nothing in the futuro for the redemption of Ireland will be likely to arise from the movement The O'Mnkemoneys have, until now, had nearly all tho cream and the poteen | that could be squeezed from the Order. What tbe honorable Fenian Senate should now do is to order tho distribution of the fund a on band among (hose charitable objects which abound so abundantly within the sphore of the Brother hood, and, by thus assisting in 'ameliorating tbe condition of tbpir poor and suffering Irish born kindred, establish a reputation which will stand nobly until the opportune hour ar rives for the erection of the monument to Em met upon Irish soil. Amikican Inti rests in thb Pacific and In dian Oceans ? Our Enterprrb Abroad.? When the late rebellion collapsed the Hbrald found itself in command of a Urge number of veteran war correspondents, for whom no longer existed the painful duty which bad called the corps into existence. With a promptitude which was equalled only by that of Secretary Stanton in mustering out the eight hundred thousand vete rans which were left on his hands without farther work to do, we began to dispose of our | war correspondents. None, however, were mustered out Their work was not finished, but extended-? tbe field of labor becoming the world, not a single eontinent As some few soldiers were retained to garrison the South so also were correspondents necessary to inspect and write up the country which had been for four years almost as a sealed book to us; and hence various correspondents were despatched to tbe State capitals to attend conventions and Legislatures and watch tbe work of reconstruc tion. Hbkald correspondents were the avonl counters of Weitsel's corps on the Rio Grande, sad others were despatched to Maximilian's capital to witness and 'chronicle the vigorous enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine. The fleet which was sent by tbe Nsvy Department to demonstrate In European wfcters found one of our old nsval correspondents awaiting its ar rival when It came to anchor in the harbor of Cherbourg. The arts of peaoe as well as those of war demanded their attention %lso, and otter correspondents were sent to chronicle the l progress of the Atlantic cable, (be Baatu telegraph and the Mount Oenis tonneL inaf ' oHmm weseafroae of oar oorrsspoadsaf with ?a roving ooaaissloa through tie Bast? <xver tbe Pacifio sad Indian Ooeans and China Seas? with luqjyructlqnp to look alter American eater- J >-v . | prise American commercial proepeour,in I Egypt ln<??t, Ceylon, China, Australia and ' the East gen?"?Uy, and Me what the French, English and Bu&wna were doing in that im portant part of the world. We publish to-day a series of letters fr<W this correspondent of more than usual interest. The PrMldeat'i C*arw Plalalf Harked Oat* Whatever Congress may do, President John son has bat one course to pursue to restore harmony to the country and to preserve the principles of our government, and that is the one he started upon. We have a better opinion of the majority of the conservative men, both in the Senate and House, than to think they will follow the lead of the Jaoobins who jumped np and cracked their whip so triumphantly the first day of the session. We cannot believe they will betray their constituencies and the beat interests of the country in Mich a manner. They know bow universally the President's restoration policy was and is approved. The peoplo everywhere endorse it. During the Congressional elections no one dared to raise bis voloe against it, except a few crazy or cynical radicals, and they only in murmurs. Nearly all were elected as avowed supporters of the President and his polioy ? a policy that was well under stood, and which looks to the earliest restora tion of the Southern States to their normal con dition in tho Union. To follow Stevens, Sumner, and the few other Jaoobins now in opposition to this policy, to spam and kick away the plat form by which they reached their seats, would be on the part of members an aot of unparal leled treachery toward the peoplo. We cannot bellevo the majority would be guilty of such a fraud, or that, for mistaken political or party ends, they wish to keep the country in an un settled and agitated state. There are evident indications that the conservative portion are dissatisfied with their own conduct, and the position they were spurred into the first hours of the session. It is to bo hoped, therefore, they will speedily cut loose from those cynical, fanatical and revolutionary disorganizes' who endeavor to drive them into opposition to the President Should we be disappointed, however, and Congress adopt tho prescriptive programme laid down by Stevens in the House and Sumner in the Senate, Mr. Johnson ought not to change his pur poso or alter his course. It is very desira ble that the executive and legislative branches of the government should act In harmony, and particularly at the present ttme, when such im portant qudslions require attention and co operation. God knows we have had Btrife enough? sectional strife far too much ? and the country prays for repose, for oblivion of the past as far as possible, and for an era of bellor feeling. To bring this about it asks for concert of action botween Congress and the Executive to heal the wounds of civil war; and it expects the hnppiest results from the broad, liberal and conciliatory policy of tho Presi I dent. Harmony, then, is most desirable be tween the different brandies of the government But not harmony in a mischievous and destruc tive course? not harmony in violating promises to Iho country and cheating It in tho expecta tions that have been raised. Botter opposition thin this. Some of our radical contemporaries begin to spo ik of harmony. The TVibune even uro;o8 it. Since ifao President's Message ap peared and somo of the conservative republi cans in Congress have evinced a disposition to oppose the disorganizing measures introduced by the ultra leaders on Monday, the politic radical press speaks of harmony. It appears to bo alarm od at the effect the presumption and extreme measures of its friends havo produced. It seems to Bmell the trouble that is not far off. The meaning of all this is that they will drive tho President, if they can, into their destructive measures, and if they cannot they will endea vor to cajole him. Harmony means with them using the President to the utmost they can to carry out their views if they should not be able to force him. Mr. Johnson is remarkable for certain qualities upon Which it might be well for these radicals to reflect We will just men tion them for the benoflt of those gentle men. Every one who knows his history is aware that he is an astute politician. We believe he never failed in any political contest he ever undertook. , His whole career and Ike development* of his character through a long priblic life show him to1 be a remarka bly firm man. His honesty is proverbial. Such a maw is not likely to bo moved from his purpose or defestod. Tho ground he has taken for the r4*tbration of the Southern States was thoroughly examined. He proceeded upon broad, statesmanlike views and sound princi ples. With the constitution as bis guide, he says tho rebel States nover have been out of the Union, and could not be, whatever indi viduals in those States may have declared or done. Then, looking at the principles and feelings that govern human nature, and at the history of other countries which have had civil wars, he sees that the most effectual remedy for the wounds that have been made, and to restore fraternal relations, is by a magnani mous policy. We are a homogeneous people, and we should soon become firmly united in feeling and interests, notwithstanding the in tensity of the war, if both sections rejoice in the same rights and privileges. This is the foundation of his policy towards the South. It is that of a statesman. He ought not to swerve from it, and we think he will not In opposing his restoration policy Congress would be acting in opposition to the sentiment of the country, and oontrary to what most of the members professed during the elections. We hope there will be a sufficient number of members to neutralize, at least, radical measures. But should this not be the case, he has an immense power in the veto, k? the pat ronage of the government and in his legiti mate executive Amotions over the South. He can bring the States of that section to the point where they may exercise all the loeal func tions which the State of New York or any other State may exercise, and leave them there. Should the houses of Congress refuse to admit members, that question would be decided by the people at the next Congressional elections, aad there oan be no doubt a to how It would be settled. The great majority of the people ?ea with the President now, and they would be with him overwhelmingly la aueh a contest Lei him, then, firmly adhere to hie policy and pursue Ike even tenor of hie way.

Theatrical enterpL in ^ city has recently taken upon itself * new lease of life. Tha motto seems to be "Forward, Excelsior." We hare already allude* "1 to the English an? French theatre, to be nna'er the joint manage ment of Messrs. Davenport a nd Juignet, the pro* posed new establishment on ?? be corner ofTwen ty-third street and Eighth area. u?. *?d the opera house of George Christy's Mia 'strels, already In successful operation, nesr the . Fifth Arena Hotel. In addition to these, set* 0r*l smaller but none the less oommendable St iterprises, which It is unnecessary to specify k 1 detail, are either in process of construction ori/T^bea of as about to be erected. There will plst x be a new theatre in the Bowery, a free museum ' *1 Central Park, skating ad tibUum, and wk * the theatres and musical halls already in pra ' gress, the citizens of New Tork may not, aftec^ all, be compelled to go to the provinces fee consistent intellectual recreation. It Is a re lief to be able to arrive at this conclusion. But the climax had not been attained in tha establishments previously enumerated. Tha metropolis needed a first ojass theatre, which, setting aside all the old and worn out and dangerous dogmas of the drama, should boldly strike out in the path of advancement and ra* form. Such a place of amusement will before many days be opened by Miss Lucy Rushton, se conded by several gentlemen of known financial and administrative ability, on the site of the old Church of the Messiah, Nos. 728 and 739 Broadway, opposite the Now York Hotel. The building has been leased until the 1st of May next as it stands from its owner, A. T. Stewart, Esq., and Miss Rushton, the lessee, has also suo> ceeded in making a contract, by the terms of f which Mr. Stewart is to greatly enlarge and improve the property for a leasehold of a term of years. For present use Miss Rushton pro poses expending upon the edifice, in the way of scenery, stage appurtenances, adornments and neocssary fixtures, some thirty thousand dollars, which will render it tenable for a place of amusement until the spring, when the per manent alterations can be commenced. Mr. Stewart's expenditure upon the edifice can hardly be estimated at present, but it will be large tnd commensurate with the demand and the gentleman's well known public spirit, edness in affairs of the kind. Of his ability to make it the largest and best adapted theatre In America no person will harbor a doubt la making* tbese enlargements and amendments the entire rear wall of the old building will be taken away and extended baokward as fkr as Lafayette place. The space will be filled with one of the largest and most complete of stages. There will be a free passage to Lathy ette place. The hallway and vestibule wfll be in the centre of the edifice, and of a sufl ciont width to prevent undue stoppages in exit or entrance. The first floor of the Broadway front will oonsist of business houses. There will also be the best and latest improved pre parations for extinguishing fires, and all the known preventives of combustion on and off the stage. The management of the new theatre, whan all things may be prepared, propose enyagiag tho crime d? la orbne of the dramatic profes sion, male and female. Having started forth untrammelled by the restraints of any and ? every combination, with plenty of material aid, possessing administrative ability of a high order, and intent upon doing everything pos sible to be accomplished by lavish outlay of money, it is her purpose to secure the bait company and produce the best plaoe of amuse ment in America. The aim is of the very highest, and every well-wisher of the drama ia the country will wish Miss Rushton the utmost success in her undertaking. The great incentive to superior acting in the dramatic profession? combined with a love of art? is a good salary and a sure one. It i> the same in other professions. The monopoly of dictation in all things now merged in the Managers' Association has caused the ladiee and gentlemen of the stage to tremble sod fear that they may be doprived at any moment of their pecuniary support, or, at best, a por tion of it, should their owners choose, in their supreme Wisdom, to decree a reduction. Those who may be engaged by Miss Rushton will be placcd above that contingency. She will therefore secure the very best of talent Thie will redound to public and private credit Miss Rushton must expect to meet with oppo sition. It is the fate of all reforms. When we started fbe Nkw York Herald, years ago, we met with opposition. We had old and favorite sheets to overpower. There were well knows editors to outshine. But taking our own course, fearing none, truckling to none, and mainly desirous of accomplishing some thing that should be creditable to the United States and beneficial to the mass of mankind, we have succeeded. We made ft path for our own feet and walked in it If Miss Rushton pursues such a course, shunning the old byroads, already worn deep into the soil, and hence unworthy to be pursued by the spirit of improvement, and caters properly to the better instincts, the improving tendenciee of the country, and tries taitbftilly to elevate the same drama that others so strenuously strive to degrade and belittle, she mnst alee prosper. There should be no suoh word se fail. Affair* la Loalirlllr. Locistills, Dec. #, 186ft. At tbo Jefferson Circuit Court, while th* trial of Colon*! Jsquee wm progressing.
