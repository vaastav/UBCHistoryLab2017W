James Mclutlre, internal Revenue Collector for this district, for au early pamphlet copy of th« Annual Keport of tbe Secretary of the Treaaury, for which th« efficient and obliging Collector will accept oar thanks. Tint President's Message es we stated yesterday, in a brief reference to It, is a very long document presenting little that is qew or entertaining to tbe gen eral reader, its publication in full there fore, haa not been thought necessary by a great number of newspapers. Tbe pressure upon the columns of the OazxTTfl precludes our publishing more than a synopsis. Tbe docament is a very creditable state paper, aud shows that tbe President desires the prosperity of tbs whole country although lie may not favor the way of bringiug this about wbicb tbe Democrats commend. Mr. Hayes' administration has on the whole been a better oue than hia op ponents bal been led lo expect he went Into office over the great w .ong that bad been perpetrated upon the voters of tke country whose voice was overridden and set at defiance by his installation. The Messages of tbe Pn - i lents of late years have not the influeuc. they formerly possessed, aud are, tbeielore, given very little aUeutiou. Nothing could illustrate tins more fully tliau the disregard which Cougresa paid to the recommendation ot the policy of Civil Service Kefoitn by Mr. Hayes, in hia tirât annual message. That policy was wholly disregarded by hia party, aud dually set a.iJo by him self; aud yet he returns to it aud urges Ils adoption with as much force in this his last annual message as though it bad not been made the scoff of such men as CoDkling, Devens, Edmunds, and Sher man, and the ablest men of his party. The Message recommends Mr. Sher man's financial policy for issuing nl trea sury notes not lesa denomination than $10, bearing a low rate of interest, to take up the per cent, bonds coming due during the next ten years, ihe first ot which, lo the amount of $*2,Stfl,64b, are due and payable on the 30th of June next. These boude amount to tf>-0, 004,708.48, and fall due each year, in amounts fiom forty-three millions next June to sixty-one millions iu June 1801, The argumeut advanced for this is tliai tbe sbundsnee of money will enable the people to take these treasury notes or small bonds as an investment, and they can be redeemed through the sinking fund as they become due, while tlieii Issue would save the government frern buying the 4^ per cent, bonds at a pre mium. What effect the issue of these notes will have upon the money market will doubtless form a theme for news paper discussion. The large amount of coined mofley now coming into the country has not served to inflate the market; but whether forty-three mil lions ol treasury motes can he added without doing so will depend much upon circumstances at thu time of Ibeii issue. lieu Secrmtaby Bhibhak in his kiinual report gives tho ordinary revenues of the government for the fiscal yeai which ended June 30, 1890, as $333. (26,610.98, and tho ordinary expendi— turet $267,642,957.78. $73,904,617.41 was applied to the sink ing fund. The net increase in receipts over the fiscal year 1878-79 was $.59, 699,426.52. Tho sum of The total receipts, actual and estimated, for tlie current fiscal year were set down at $3-50,000,000,and the expenditures at $200,000,000. A committee on appropriations for each house of Congress with power to sit during the rtfcess is recommended by the Secretary. A NEW 

GAMBLING DEN. Washington, December 5 —Ths^e is a new gaming establishment which will be opened iu a week or so on F •treat (all the other games are on Penn sylvania avenue), which will outshine the palace that John Morrissey ran here several years before he died. The fur niture of the card room alone cost fti, 000. Three huudred dollar lounges are scattered about the place for the weary to rest on. The sideboaid surpasses i elegance any similar piece of furniture In any private residence, while tbe china was made to order and corresponds Ihe rsst of tbe display. Everything is to be gilt-edged, and the waiters are to wear white kid gloves In serving tin nightly banquet, which, of course, is giv •n free lo all ths customers of the place. Regular players are to be taken to their homes after they ti»*e of playing in riages belonging to tlie establishment.— Of coursa a place of this kind is saf. from the polies, aud all know it. has not been a gambling place raided ii. this city for three years. It is expensive to keep a house open, though the busi ness, If It can be called a business, pay» well in the long run. The ordinan faro bank furnishes a supper at mid night that costa tbe bouse about $40_ This is furnished, though a dollar i . ill» car There ma) not be risked ou the games. Within one square of Wiliard a Hotel or the Ebbitt House one dozen games are during the entire winter. There are a half-dozen games in operation wir bin seventy .five yards of the National and Metropolitan Hotels. run THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. From the M. Y. Herald. Ah tu finance» also tlie President intimates that in bis oninion a double monetary standard is not merely permitted but is required by the constitution of tbe United States. Though his language on this subject is somewhat hazy that seems to be its fairest construction, and it cer tainly is an interpretation < f the constitution wbicb cannot be accept ed. Both as to tbe disposition of the greenback currency and aH to the light weighted »ilver dollar liier« is some discrepancy of views be tween the President and the Secre tary of the Treasury. The Presi dent recommends not merely tbs withdrawal of tbe legal tender quality from Treasury notes, but their total withdrawal from circula tion, while the Secretary would keep them in circulation shorn of the legal tender quality. The President also retrain* from recommending the absolute cessation of a silver dollar coinage, which the Secretary pre sents as one of his alternative modes for the treatment of the silver ques tion. In respect to civil service reform President advises a multitude of remedial statutes. But he makes uo allusion to his celebrated "Civil Service Order, No. 1," dated June 22, 1877, which forbade all civil officers "to take part in the manage ment of political organizations, caucuses, conventions or election campaigns," and declared that "uo assessment for political purposes on officers or subordinates should b« allowed." With regard to wliatused tobe call ed the "Southern question," inasmuch as President Hayes' course concerning it has been signalized by more up rightness and consistency than his con duct touching the' c.vil service, so bis recommendations will carry greater weight. No just exception can bo taken to his appual to Congress to see "that every case of violation of the letter or spirit of tbe fifteenth amend ment of the constitution is thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall accrue to any per son or party." As to his proposition for liberal grants of public lauds and appropriations from the federal Treas ury to assist popular education in the .Southern Sta'es, it is premature to give assent lo .t. The idea was first broached in a speech of President Hayes in Ohio only a few months ago, and a'though Congressional land grant* to all the btales proportionally for educational purposes are not novel yet the sectional character of the gifts wbicli arc now proposed and the vast scale on which they arc suggested, as the relations of the project to tho federal homestead laws, all lorbid a hasty acquiescence in such a plan without sight of the details by it is proposed to be carried into execu tion. The same may be said with te gard to the President's vague outline sketch of an immense scheme of inter nal improvements in the Valley of rhe Mississippi, comprising not only that stream but all its tributaries. U is sstisfacrory to know that the President heartily approves the new In ti an policy which contemplates as its ultimate purpose the dissolution of tn nal relations and transite matlon of the ludians Into citizens. The too brief approval of legislation to institute postal savings banks also is auislaclory. The maintenance of the army alitsfull legal strength is exhorted and large appropri ations are advised for sea coast defences as well as generous federal aid tow ard making the acl the Well hic.il uiililia a powerful loi ce.
