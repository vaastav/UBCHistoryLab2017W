France is in an uproar over the enforce nient of the law for the separation of the Church and State. The situation is the outcome of the law of ‘associations cul tuelles,” passed to regulate the relations between the State and religious bodies. It provides that persons may associate themselves together for religious worship if they comply with the requirements of the law regarding the management of their property. Church property is for feited to the State for non-compliance to the law. The law has been described as establishing the same relations between religious bodies and the State as exist in this country. According to figures compiled by R. G Dunn Company the cost of living is on the increase, it requiring $2 more for living expenses during the month ending December I, than it did the month pre vious. The cost of commodities is the highest since Febrnary, 1884. The mark ed advance in prices is explained as due to the higher cost of butter, eggs, milk, dairy and garden products Breadstuffs were lower on account of the decline in wheat and corn. Meats, with the excep tion of live beef, were fractionally lower, and a small decline 'occurred in mess pork, bacon, live hogs, lard and tallow. Butter is up 3 cents a pound, eggs 7 cents a dozen and hay 12J4 cents a hundred pounds. President Roosevelt and Bellamy Storer have been occupying a great deal of newspaper space recently over the con troversy arising out of the dismissal of the latter from bis post of Ambassador to Austria-Hungary. Some interesting de velopments will no doubt transpire before the scandal blows over. According to Mr. Storer, his wife’s efforts to have Arch bishop Ireland elevated to a Cardinal were made at President Roosevelt’s in stigation, notwithstanding which Storer was dismissed on account of them. The President uses up 5,000 words in denying the allegatiorf in a strenuous manner and electing the dismissed Ambassador to membership in the Ananias club. The annual report of Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock gives some idea of the enormity of the land fraud scandal with which bis Department has been wrestling. Despite the inactivity of Con gress and the powerful political influences which have been exerted against the Sec retary he has succeeded in obtaining 89 convictions in the 490 indictments for fraud found against persons of high and low degree. Congress is to blame for the existence of the system which has bred corruption in the public land department, and persistently refuses to lend the Sec retary any assistance in ferreting out or bringing to justice the guilty parties. The reason for this inaction is readily found in the fact that numerous United States Senators and Representatives are impli cated in the frauds, and naturally they decline to aid in their own conviction. Condition Ot Our Public Roads. The following item, relative to the con dition of the public roads in upper Cecil was furnished the Oxford Press by its Calvert correspondent : “The Commissioners of Cecil county would do a good service for the traveling public the coming winter by fencing up the public road from Calvert to the Penn sylvania State line below Chrome, Ches ter county. A great portion of this road is now unfit to travel on because of inat tention by the party whose duty it is to keep it in repair. It is full of holes and deep muddy ruts, with many large sized stones lying on itssurfa'ce. The ’mender,’ we are informed, has not done any work on it this year. People traveling from the north to Calvert should go and return byway of the ‘White House.’ ” The "inattention” complained of by the Calvert correspondent is responsible for the wretched condition of numerous of our roads, and as the season at present is one wherein little road work can be done there is not much prospect for im provement. Some weeks ago the Com missioners were petitioned to gravel the Barnes’ Corner road, in the hope that the ' work might be done before winter set in, but no action, we understand, was taken. It is hoped that if this work is ever done the matter of preparation of the road bed ■ and drainage will be given proper atten tion before the gravel is applied, if good j results are expected. The dumping of gravel in the roads without due attention to the important items mentioned, as has been done in numerous instances, has proven as unsatisfactory in obtaining ■ lasting results as have the other careless methods of road mendiug long practiced in our county. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. It is demonstrated this early in the ses sion that a ship subsidy bill will be pass ed, not perhaps the general subsidy out lined in Secretary Root’s memorable speech at Kansas City but a subsidy con fined strictly to ships plying between the United States and South American ports and the Philippines. Such a subsidy will answer for an opening wedge and if the experiment shall prove efficacious in reviving the American merchant marine it can bejextended to cover other routes. * * * That the situation as regards strained relations with Japan is not serious and that the President is satisfied that the trouble has been at least temporarily ad justed is evidenced by the departure of Secretary Root for New York Thursday. The effect of the President’s message has been most satisfactory so far as the little Japs are concerned and Viscount Aoki who is Ambassador from the Flowery Kingdom made a special call at the White House to thank the President for his cordial words about Japan and to assure him in bis polished Japanese manner that Japan entertains no less flattering regard for the United States. In spite of official denials from the White House and from the Departments it is nevertheless per sistently rumored that a new treaty had been negotiated with Japan which pro vided for the exclusion of Japanese coolies from the United States. If there is no such treaty under advisement at least there is an agreement that will take the place of a'formal treaty and by which the Japanese will be restrained from sending coolies into this country. It is well known that the Japanese will not consider this exclusion a hardship for they prefer to bring about increased immigration to Korea and Manchuria by sending the coolies there rather than having them go to the United States. Senator Perkins of California has had several long interviews with the President since the message was delivered to Congress and since the part relating to the California trouble caused such a stir among Calitornia Representa tives and Senators. As a result of these interviews the ruffled feelings of the Cal ifornians have been smoothed out, for Senator Perkins has explained that the President’s reference to. his intention to use military force if necessary was meant to apply only to an instance where Jap anese protected by treaty rights were threatened with pbysicial violence. * * * Secretary Bonaparte in his annual re port to Congress advises the construction of two great battleships as formidable as those possessed by any power in the world, to cost about ten millions of dollars each. He wants these two monster ships in addition to the big battleship author ized at the last sessiou of Congress. He also recommends the more rapid promo tion of junior officers, and the establish ment of a reserve list, composed of a large force of seamen to be held in readiness for emergency and to he added to the navy at the outbreak of war. He also believes that there should be a general increase of salaries in the civil list in order that the Navy department may keep its efficient clerks instead of having them lured away by the offers of better salaries in other employments. * * • As was to be expected the dismissal of the negro troops was promptly taken up by Congress and before twenty-four hours had passed Senator Penrose had intro duced a resolution criticizing the Presi dent’s action in the matter and was fol lowed by Senator Foraker, who thought that Senator Penrose bad not been severe enough on the Chief Executive. Taking the matter in his own hands he preferred a resolution of a more vigorous character and one calling for fqll official informa tion regarding the circumstances of the discharge. After a spirited attack on the policy of the President iu which he said “I deny the right of the President to dis charge a soldier where the dismissal car ries punishment, without trial by court martial.” The resolution was passed by the Senate. Senator I-'oraker declares i that he is not seeking to raise a race ' question and that the matter is not oue of color at all. To his mind the whole army is involved and he asks dramatically, I “What is the use of Congress raising an 1 ■ army if the President at one stroke could I ' disband it ? ” * * * ! The Rivers and Harbors Congress with representatives from every part of the' country where waterways are used or re- { quired has been iu session iu Washington during the week. The object of the Cou ; gress is to prevail upon Congress to vote | an annual appropriation of not less than #50,000,000 for the improvement of rivers and harbors. Several hundred delegates have attended the meeting here and addresses have been delivered by Speaker Caunon and other prominent men, and Vice President Fairbanks has attended some of the sessions. The President received the delegates to the convention and expressed himself to them as heartily in favor of any movement that looked to the betterment of conditions in the great waterways of the country, or of the open ing of new ones to commerce. * * * The startling revelations of the Wyoming land frauds threaten to involve at least two United States Senators, prom inent officials of the general land office and other well known men. Millions of dollars are at stake and the Interstate Commerce Commission has secured dur ing its hearing of the cases testimony enough to supply many great law suits, but the most absorbing feature of the sit uation to those whose interests are not directly involved is with regard to Senator Clark and Senator Warren, who are said to be implicated in the coal land graft which has resulted in the President rec ommending that the coal lands be per manently withdrawn from settlement. Senators Clark and Warren, particularly the latter, have been held in high regard in Washington and the announcement that they were involved in the land scan-, dal has been unwillingly accepted by many of their fellow Senators and friends outside. When the rumor first became public a prominent Senator threw up his • hands and exclaimed, “Great Heavens, what is the Senate coming to anyway. Pretty soon it will be looked upon as a disgrace to be in the Senate and people will avoid speaking to a Senator on the street for fear of being liable to the de duction that 'birds of a feather flock together.’ ” More optimistic people though do not take the despairing view of the prominent Senator. They declare that the Senate is no worse than it always was, and that in fact it is really better, but that it is harder for a dishonest man to escape or hide these days. ■ If ~ J
