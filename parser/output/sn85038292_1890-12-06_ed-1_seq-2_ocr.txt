?hc fcmofvatk Advocate. WESTMINSTER, MD. SATURDAY. DKCKMBKR *., 1890. Spurning the Popular Voice. The annual messago ot President Harrison w rt ,s sent to Congress on Monclay. Its leading topic’s an* an argument in defence of the McKinley bill and a recommendation to pass the Lodge Force hill, both of which were so emphatically spurned by the people at the ballot box on the 4th of November last. A more emphatic expression of condemnation by the people, was never heard of in this or any other country. Hut it passes by the im personation of obstinacy domiciled in the White House, as the idle wind which he heeds not. Is such conduct more becoming the President of a free republic, or the Czar of all the Kussias. the veriest despot on earth? Such conduct is not statesmanship, it is revo lutionary thus to defy the will of the people. It is madness, the spirit of the bravado, stim ulated by a phrenzied brain, instead ot the calm and dignified submission to the public will which should ever characterize the con duct of the President. And on the same day this mad cap recommendation was made, his followers, in the Senate, met in solemn con clave, and resolved to press this infamous measure to a final passage, in open defiance of the sweeping and tremendous majority given against it by the people ! “Whom the •>oda would destroy they first make mad. And was ever such madness seen since the world began ? The servants, the representa tives of a free people, in dark and damning conspiracy against the liberties of the peoplel It is nothing less, and ought to arouse the whole people, from the centre to the circum ference of I his vast land, that the Cntalincsat the Capital are plotting treason against public Ulc Ulipnai •> r> i V liberty with the President at their head 1 It ( is well lor us to inquire, Just here, what would ( have been the course pursued in monarchial ( England, under such a majority as that cast l at the polls on the 4th of November? Mon { arcbial though that government be. it would , not have dared to defy the people in this | , way. No, the ministry would have immedi ( ately resigned, and a new ministry, more in j < accord with the popular will, would have taken j its place. But, here, in free and republican | America, a President of the United States. I supposed to be the representative of the pco ( pie, in the face of their most emphatic protest ' , at the polls, and in utter defiance of their j ( will, urges the adoption of a measure which ; , strikes at the most vital principle of republi- , can government, and takes out of the hands j of the citizens of the States the management , of their own elections and places that manage- , ment in the hands of Federal officials, so that elections shall be no longer free. Will a people who have not yet the Federal mana cles upon their wrists, submit to this state of things. In other words, are the American . people ready to surrender their liberties, for to this compaction it will come at lasUunder this infamous Lodge Force Hill, if it becomes a law. If the bill should become a law, do its . friends fondly dream that it can be executed without force and arms and bloodshed ? Not ; until every expedient known to the Constitu tion and the Courts has been exhausted, and not then until every manly principle of the human breast is crushed, and American lib- ! ' erty is a thing of the past, and the object for which this government was founded—the i I iher lif of the people is lost in utter despotism, i The principles which animated the founders j of this government still live in the breasts ol ] their sons. They still cling to the old theory ; of the immortal author of the Declaration of | Independence, that governments are instituted j among men to secure “life, liberty and the \ pursuit of happiness.' 1 ill-riving their powers from the ronsen^ jdThe over str ' )V i j A meiacan liberty, ami to ignore the consent of 1 the people, can possibly exist while vitality ( still warms the active limbs of her patriotic ; citizens. A blind fatuity seems to be hover- { 1 ing over the Administration and its misguided I 1 supporters, that will ultimately lead it and ; ‘ them to inevitable overthrow. Do they want a more arophalic pronuncia- : mento against their nefarious schemes than j that of November? They will get it. A city contemporary says— “ President Harrison may wear Grandpa’s j 1 Hat, but it doesn’t cover Grandpa's brains.” Brains were not the heritage of the Harri son family, and it scarcely admits of a doubt, that the grandson, however deficient he may be in cerebral development, is scarcely be neath the standard of Ihe grandpa. The hat hadn’t an unusual amount of brains to cover. Grandpa was a sort of accidental President. He was the creature of circumstances. He happened to have rendered some small mili tary service to the country, and bore the title of General, which fact, was no unimportant factor in his elevation to the Presidency, as it has been in the career of others since, serv ing them in some .vrt, instead of brains. The country, at the same time, plunged into a wild fantastic craze, in which brains were at a decided discount, for President Martin Van Bureii, who was the victim of this brain less harlequinade, had more bruins than all <he Harrison family combined. llis brains, however, did not save him from defeat, for brains wen* not a desideratum at that time, any more than they were a little later on, when the grandson was nominated, Parnell’s Downfall. 1 * Parnell's proven immorality has divided the Irish Home Rule party. His efforts to ; continue in the leadership, against the advice : • and wishes of many of his former supporters, j 1 has created the belief that Parnell is more of a selfish Parnellite than a statesman: that he cares more for his personal advancement than j for the cause of Ireland. Futhermore, he £ has estranged Mr. Gladstone and the Liberal i leaders, and hopelessly divided, for the time, I the party, and has set hack the lime for g the accomplishment of home rule ami other measures for the advancement of the cause of j Ireland. The Advocate has not been dis- ; ; j, appointed in Purnell. It has always regarded i | D him as an agitator, not a statesman, and in r, teresled solely in his own political welfare. V ——— j e Ex-State Treasurer Archer's bondsmen are 1 availing themselves of every technicality. Lot D them cease this, and meet their obligations, n It would he belter for them and the state if § they would acknowledge their liability, and P meet it as best they can. No one wants them ] ® to impoverish themselves. If to meet the j c whole obligation would he a hardship, let a compromise he effected —u just and fair one, j and the people will he satisfied. There is no use in both sides paying huge attorney s fees I and spending other large sums to light the • matter through the courts. Judge Williams, of the Lewis county, New York, court, has ordered the county canvas* sers to count eleven alleged defective ballots, |J it being apparent how the voters intended to :jj| vole, the Judge declaring it improper to reject it§ the ballots upon technical grounds. This decri al sion gives the Democratic candidates for the |jg Legislature eight and increases the ' pi Democratic majority on joint ballot in that body to six. ex Hon. Clifton R. Breckinridge, of Arkansas, I |p€ who was ousted from his scat near the close ; ■MI of the last session by Heed's order, was re i mm elected, and on Monday last was sworn in as ' ■p (,is own successor, much to the discomfort of, ' BTc |tcel. When he went to the Clerk’s desk to | HI sworn in he was warmlynpplauded by the | Democratic aide of the House. The President’s Message. Pass the Force bill, Uphold the McKinley bill, Grant subsides to Steamship lines, Pass an apportionment hill, based upon Porter’s fraudulent census. These are the main recommendations of Presdcnt Harrison’s message to Congress on Monday last. -Mr. Harrison has thus given renewed evidence that he is a mere partisan, with none of the elements of a statesman. He is not even possessed of ordinary political sagacity, for the country has just repudiated these measures by a majority approximating a million. A shrewd politician, when beaten, would retrace steps ami get in line with pub lic sentiment. Mr. Harrison is too obtuse to see the drift of sentiment, and persists in a course the country,has condemned. If he continues the same line upon which he started, the cyclone of November, 1890, will be only a summer breeze compared with the blizzard that will effectually blast the Harri son-Ueed-Mclvinley combination in 1892. It has been asserted that twelve Senators and fifteen Representatives had a special in terest in the passage of the silver bill during the last session of Congress. Pending the passage of the bill, it is alleged, this number of Senators and Representatives was ad ; milled to partnership in various “silver pools’ by which they realized one million dollars 1 profits in the advance of the price of silver after the passage of the act. Iti the House on Monday Mr. Dockery, of Missouri, introduced a resolution setting forth these allegations and providing for an investigation by the Com mittee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, There can be no harm done in making the ! investigation, and those alleged to have pro ! fired should he foremost in advocacy of the ’ resolution, if they are falsely accused. 1 The Reform Club of New York city will ’ ceehrate the November victories by a ban- quel in Madison Square Garden on Tuesday evening, 1 )ecember 23d. The banquet will be on a large scale, and all the prominent tariff reformers in the country are expected to be present, particularly the newly elected Gov ernors and Congressmen who are identified with the movement for tariff revision and re duction. Ex-President Cleveland, Senator Carlisle and Congressmen Mills will be prom inent figures at the banquet. The Baltimore Manufacturers' Record is doing more for the development of the South than any journal in the country. Its corps of correspondents are ever on the alert and all their statements can be relied upon. The in formation they give is not paid for, but is gathered from actual observation and from the best men in each community. It is suited to ;1 1l classes—buyurs, sellers, those who are looking for investments, either permanent or speculative. The Pulitzer Building, the new home of the great New York World , and probably tin* best appointed newspaper establishment in the world, will be formally opened on Wed m sday evening next. The Advocate ac knowledges an invitation to the opening ex- Thc meaning of Harrison’s Message; We — Harrison, lieed, McKinley, Hoar and Frye— We are the people; all the rest are but dogs. The Farmers’ Alliance Against the Force Bill. The National Convention of the Farmers’ Alliance is in session at Ocala, Florida. of the most significant signs of Wed my 1 . g i session was the presentation and u- f adoption of resolutions in mf the l.ortgc Kort-c bill. In ,]S ]*“ r,rulers of the \ojV a.

'This action is fully in accord with the anti-sectional attitude of the alliance. The anti-force bill resolutions were intro duced by Win. S. McAllister, of Mississippi, after consultation with Northwestern mem bers, and it was unanimously adopted after debate. One delegate from Pennsylvania and one from Illinois thought the resolutions were untimely, and would retard the order in their states, bnt voted for them on their final The preamble and resolutions were as follows: “Whereas the President of the United States, in his annual message to Congress, recommends and urges the immediate passage of the measure known as the Lodge election bill: and “Whereas said oill involves a radical revo lution in the election machinery of the Union, both stale and national, and its passage will be fatal to the autonomy of the stales and cherished liberties of the citizens; and “Whereas said bill is partisan in spirit and will be partisan in its application, thus re vitalizing t lie gory ghost of sectional estrange ment; and whereas, in the holy war which we have declared against sectionalism, the fire sides of the farmers of the North, East, South and West are the citadels around which the heaviest battles are being fought, and to the end that victory may crown our crusade, let fraternity and unity reign. Therefore be it “Resolved by the National Farmers’ Al liance and Industrial Union of America, in national council assembled, 'That we do most solemnly protest against the pusssge of said Lodge election bill, and we most earnestly petition our Seuatois to employ ail fair and legal means to defeat this unpatriotic measure, which can result in nothing but evil to onr common and beloved country. “Resolved further, 'That a copy of this pre amble and resolutions be forwarded to each Senator in Congress.” Meeting of Congress. The second session of the Fifty-first Con i gress opened last Monday. In the Senate, the two Senators-elect from Wyom.ng were sworn in and drew lots for 1 their terms. The short term, closing March 1893, fell to Mr. Warren, and the long term, closing in 1895, to Mr. Carey. After the appointment of the usual committee to wait upon the President, a recess was taken. On reassembling the President’s message was received and read, and the Senate then ad journed for the day. In the House, after the call of the roll had disclosed the presence of a quorum, a com mitttee was appointed to join the Senate committee to wait upon the President. Some members elect, including the two new Rep resentatives from Wyoming, C. R. Breckin ridge, of the Second Arkansas District, and C. W. Stone, of the Twenty-seventh Pennsyl i vania. were qualified and took their seats. The delegate from the Territory of Oklahoma j was also sworn in. After a recess the Presi dent’s message was received, read and re ferred to the Committee of the Whole. The (tension appropriations hill was reported and similarly referred. Mr. Dockery, of Missouri, offered in the House a resolution for reference, reciting that it is alleged that twelve Senators ana fifteen Representatives, pending the passage of the silver bill, were admitted to partner ship in various “silver pools," by which they realized $1,000,000 profits in the advance of the price of silver after the passage of the act, and directing the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures to inquire into all the facts and circumstances connected with the alleged purchase and sale of silver. They shall have leave to send for papers and per sons and to report at any time. Resolutions were intoduced by Representatives Flower and Cummins, directing the Secretary of the Interior to order the taking of a new census of New York city. The six story cotton spinning mill of the i A. Campbell Manufacturing Company, at . Mannyunk, Pa., was partly destroyed by fire Monday afternoon, causing a loss estimated at more than $250,000, which is covered by insurance. Albert Crankshaw, manufacturer of fancy flannels and dress goods, occupied * j the three upper floors of the building. The 1 I 500 employes escaped in safety from the ( ! burning mill, hut Charles Snyder, foreman of ■ engine company No. 10, was killed, and * several other firemen were injured by a fall- ‘ [ ing wall. Advices from Orenburg, Eastern Russia,, on December 3, state that the mercury sud denly fell from three degrees of warmth to £ thirty degrees of cold. Four caravans of horses, sheep and camels, and thirty Kirg- 1 who were riding across the steppes, n were frozen to death. t, For the Democratic Advocate. Glasgow, Natural Bridge and the Shenandoah Valley. Ou Monday night, the 24th ultimo, at nine o’clock ; a party of fifty excursionists were rolled out of Camden station. Baltimore, on a special vestibuled train of Pullman cars enroute for Glasgow, Va., by way of the valley branch of the B. &O. and the James River division of the C. &O. The train was under the management of Mr. J. Glenn Cook, of the firm of J. Glenn Cook & Co., real estate agents and brokers. Baltimore, who have the agency of many Virginia and Southern investment and improve ment comjauies. The train arrived in Washington at 9.50, having made schedule time, and the passen gers began to think that this excursion would be more comfortable than the memorable one to Roanoke. Leaving Washington at 10 o’clock we spent the night on the train and were very comiort able indeed In our buffet sleepers. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and many of us did not care to retire, as the mountains presented a scene so mar velous and beautiful under the soft mellow light of the moon that sleep seemed far from our wonder stricken eyes. But finally Morpheus put forth his charms, and human nature succumbed to his tempt ing invitations, and one after another we turned in. We passed many cities and towns during the night, many of which have been struck by that disease, if I may so term it, called a “boom,” a word now so common and prevalent in everybody’s mouth. About C o’clock on Tuesday morning, as we were switching from the B. & O. to the C. & O. tracks, the rear truck of the sleeper Dougola got off the track and the passengers of that car were awakened by the heavy jarring of the truck running ou the cross lies. I for one was in the Dongola and I never had such a shaking, with one exception, and Uiat was the time I was sea sick. No damage was done, and some in the car did not know a thing of it until they were awakened and asked to move Into the forward sleeper. We lost considerable lime in trying to right the disabled car but all of no avail. About S o’clock it was decided we move on and leave the Dougola to await repairs. The above accident hap pened at Hast Lexington about an hour and a half 's ride from Glasgow. On the James River division we passed the famous booming city of Buena Vista. ' where many fine buildings are in course of erection, and whose growth has been marvelous. Large fur • naces, foundries and saw mills are being built, the black clay brick seeming to be used mostly. Ills hardly of interest to mention much concerning Buena Vista, as it has been on the market for some time, I and many of the papers have had column after column describing and pulling forth its advantages. <>• :n nni,in iiiu-n rmniP’ vet struliii. We will now move on to a town, young, yet strong, a town, or city I should say, of only eight months growth and is today one of the leading cities of the v&llcy. A city which is surrounded by an unsur passed region of iron, coal and limber lands. Well, to continue with our train, wc arrived at this magic city, as it is called, at 9.30 and we were escorted to the business portion by the many real estate men who put their carriages at our disposal, and we were from that time until we left, the guests of the Rockbridge Company, of which Gen. FiUhugh Lee is president. Wc breakfasted at the Hotel Brockcu borough. the first house built in Glasgow, and the only one standing there the first of last March. After breakfast we were taken around by the real estate men and shown the most desirable property and where the city would in all probability extend. We were also shown the new Rockbridge Hotel, to be ready for guests by next March, and which accomo date 7UO. There are many well located sights, both fur business and residence. About 12 o’clock the sale was commenced, a stand being erected in a vacant lot on Fitz-Lec street. Gen. Lee. as presi dent of the company, opened the sale with a little speech, made in his well known, pleasant and com prehensive manner. He alluded briefly to Glas gow’s past and present, and the hopes and prospects of the future, the object of the company in placing the lots upon the market, the happy consumma tion of the negotiations with the Canadian Syndicate of London and the certainty of the large influx of capital into Glasgow as a result which would add greatly to the development of her great natural resources. At the close of the General s remarks, the auctioneer. Mr. W. O. Beckenbuugh. of the popular firm of Schwab. Beckenbaugh & Co., of Baltimore, began the sale. Mr. Beckenbaugh has made himself quite popular through the Valley, and has met with so much success that he has made a specially of real estate. He conducted the Banner Sales at Buchanan and Front Koyal. Va., where the lots brought prices unheaitf C fore. Mr. Beckenbaugh showed g •' ot % ' ‘* ! saw that he was master of the .‘.illation i - -oat he had not time to tarry with undecided persons. Thus the sale wejw; on with spirited bidding. This being thefiijsftsale for Glasgow, give aways were "BSHf’gdbv some, but though there were tone J v ..Bht a very reasonable pree : ,1 That evening nearly alUlr V n d 1, : down to the Natnilluminated at 8 ;s 1 spent the night. a gorgeous effect, but the me choniosk aiuVts cannot compare with the natural, as was proved the next morning by the light of day. Pen cannot describe or pencil draw, a worthy picture of this natural wonder. View this wonder how you may, it is impossible for the human mind to comprehend it at first sight. It grows upon you so that ills hard for one to leave it. Itis2lsfcet high. 100 feet in width and has a span of 90 feel and is a single block of limestone, with many shades of color. The bridge spans a deep chasm called The Glen, which extends about a mile and is suddenly shut up by a beautiful waterfall, called Lace Waterfall, because the falling waters resemble the finest lace. The water falls one hundred feet and continues on down the valley babbling and causing a romantic echo to jump from tree to tree of the jnountain sides. The whole glen contains scenery so picturesque that it is enough to inspire a poet’s soul with renewed vigor. Cedar Creek is the name of that sparkling little brook that jumps from stone to stone, winding under the bridge, and finally uniting itself with the historic James. Unfortunately we arc compelled to leave this earthly paradise, the home of the poet, and go back to living men again, grasping and plotting for filthy lucre. The sale began on this day (Wednesday) at 11.30, but the bidding was not so lively, but the day was notorious for the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Marl borough. who made their appearance just in time to buy a lot in a favorable part of the city. The Duke and Duchess were escorted around by Gen. Lee and they predicted a great future for Glasgow. During the two days the sales amounted to about 9200.000, the first day over 9100,000 worth were sold and the second not quite so much. About 920,000 of Baltimore capital was invested, and one gentleman intends opening up large warehouses near the line of the Shenandoah Valley R. R. We left Glassgow that evening at 5.15 enronte for Baltimore, though a number of our parly got off at Staunton to attend the sales there on Thanksgiving Day. "Boom” seems to be the word all the way up the valley and many towns are going up. At Strasburg they have discovered a cave equal to that of Luray.andat Riverton they have struck a manganese vein far superior to any in the country, it is owned by a Baltimore company and bears the name of the Beckenbaugh Manganese Mine after Mr. W. O. Hockenbaugh the famous auctioneer. We arrived in Baltimore about 4.45 a. m., but wc were allowed to remain in our sleepers until 7 o’clock. All seemed to have enjoyed themselves and seemed much pleased with the future prospects ot Glasgow. .1. Glenn Cook & Co. will have charge of an excur sion to Hagerstown for the sales thereon IhcUth and loth Inst,, excursion tickets will be sold along the line of the Western Maryland and other roads. Elaf.k. Result in New Hampshire.—The meeting of the New Hampshire Legislature has had thus far a mixed result. The Republicans have elected a partisan clerk to make up the roll of the next legislature. This may mean a decision of the character of the next legis lature unfavorable to Democratic hopes. It looks, in fact, as if the Republicans arc as sured control of the Legislature, and will elect a Republican Senator and Governor. Chandler's scheme to have legislation now of a political character was defeated by a com promise arranged between the Republican and Democratic leaders. Gallinger, Senator Chandler's rival, has control of one branch of the legislature, and will permit nothing the Senator desires to be done. The muddle will not be definitely settled, therefore, until the new Legislature meets in January. On Tuesday morning, at 8 o'clock, the following temperature w*as reported by the weather bureau: At Ampersand, Saranac Lake, N. Y., the thermometer registered 14 degrees below zero, and reports from other sections of the Adirondacks record a much lower temperature. It is the coldest weather ever experienced in the Adirondacks at this season of the year. Among the low tempera tures reported were: Rockcliffe, Ontario, 24° below zero; Winnipeg, 20° below zero; Eastport, Me., and Fort Buford, N. D., 4° below; Boston, 8° above zero; Philadelphia and New York, 20°; Montreal, 15° below zero; Quebec, 37° below zero. On the Erie canal 50 boats were frozen in. At Cedar Rapids, lowa, there was a heavy fall of snow. The temperature at Galveston was 68°, and Jack sonville 66°. The American Harvester Company, which was incorporated a few days ago with a capital of $35,000,000, met in Chicago on Saturday and elected as directors Cyrus H. McCormick, of Chicago; Wm. Deering, of Chicago; Walter A. Wood, of UoOsac Falls, New York; Lewis Miller, of Akron, Ohio; A. S. Bushnell, of Springfield, Ohio; A. L. Conger, of Akron, Ohio, and W. C. Goudy, of Chicago. Twenty two concerns were represented at the meeting. Rev. Simon P. Anderson, colored, was on Saturday convicted in St. Louis of forgery, and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. He was pastor of the Central Baptist Church, and drew from bank nearly $1,300, forging the signature of the church clerk to checks. Maryland Affairs. Wm. J.

Tnoraas Sloan was killed by the falling of a tree, which he was cutting down, on the farm of Col. D. M. Matthews, in Dulany’s Valley, Baltimore county, on Thursday. The police census of Baltimore, just taken, makes the population 455,427. The Federal census made the population 434,151, or 21,- 270 less than the census taken by the police force. On Monday the Steinback Toy Company’s factory, in Baltimore, was burned. It was full of finished and unfinished goods. Between 300 and 500 persons are thrown out of work by the fire. Loss $20,000; partially insured. Dr. Justus Dunott died near Elkton, Cecil county, on Monday in his 90th year. He was a native of Wilmington, Del. About 40 years ago he purchased a farm near Elkton and practiced medicine there until 1805 when < he removed to Frederick and had charge of i Montview Hospital. He returned to Elkton about 10 years ago. The trustees for the bondholders of 1844 of i i the Chesapeake and Ohio canal seem to be j • in earnest in their intention to repair the , i water-way, and deposited at the Farmers ; ? and Merchants’ National Bank, Baltimore. on Monday upwards of $200,000, to pay tin* i 5 bondholders of 1878 in full, with accrued i interest. It is stated that by May Ist, the . time specified by the Court for the comple . tion of the repairs, the canal will be in full operation. J The sawmill owned by Thomas L. Carpen s ter at Plum Point, Calvert county, was totally 1 destroyed by fire on Tuesday morning about four o’clock. Mr. Charlton, the engineer, r was sleeping in the mill at the time and knew • nothing of his danger until the mill was fall- ing, when he was aroused to lind his chance ; of escape slim. Not being able to make his escape from the windows, he fought his way to the door, and in doing so was so badly burned that his life is despaired of. No insurance. A hearing was begun in Baltimore on Mon day in the injunction suit of property owners on Howard street against the Belt Line Rail road Company. The bill of complaint recites that the city ordinance and act of Assembly are both invalid, because they authorize the Belt road to lake property without due pro cess of law; that an injunction ought to be granted .because the property of the corpora tion will be mortgaged for all it is worth before the road is begun, and, therefore, any judgments obtained by the complainants for damages will be worthless; that the road ought to proceed by condemnation by a jury, as in cases of other roads: that damages should bo paid before the road is built.

For some time past the several churches of the Methodist Episcopal Conferences have been voting as to whether women shall be sent as lay delegates to the conferences. Only members of churches over 21 years of age were allowed to vote. The returns are as follows: Baltimore district reports for women delegates, 41)5; against, 916;; total vote of the district, 1,411? full members in district, 7,580. The vote is about one-fifth of the total membership. East Baltimore district returns 574 for, 880 against; total vote, 1,463; number of members in district, 8,417 —an estimate of about one-fifth voting. West Baltimore district reports 415 for, 5G7 against, a total vote of 1,082, with 8,045 members, making the average vote cast about one-sixth of those entitled to vote. The total vote in these three districts is 3,950, in a full membership of 25,051, showing an average—allowing one fourth ns not entitled to vole—of about one vote in six of those entitled to vote. The vote for women is 1,484, against 2,373; majority against, 888. [The indications are, however, that the full returns from all the conferences throughout the United States will show that the vote is in favor of the women. In the west the vote in their favor is unusually strong, being 62 per cent] The river Mersey, in England, has over flowed its banks owing to the recent heavy rains, and 4,400 navvies are thrown out of employment, and four months will elapse before they can resume work. Farming lands in many places are ruined. In Ger- ii many many lives have been lost by the flood d iug of the mines, bridges and roads destroyed. 11 In Austria hurricanes prevailed for three I days and avalanches and floods have devastat r. ed the mountain region. II The wheat crop of the state of Washington e is the largest in its history, being estimated at 16,000,000 bushels.

The inability of the railroads to move | the enormous crop to market is exasperating s the farmers, who are charging them with ? collusion with the warehousemen to lower the i price of wheat. t Two men named Whitney and Shanks got - into a difficulty with Bart Gardner, in Oak 1 Ridge, Louisiana, on Saturday night, and, . after they were separated, the constable, with f a posse, undertook to arrest Whitney and Shanks, and, upon their refusal to surrender, i a general fusilade took place, and it is reported r that Whitney and Shanks were both killed, i together with two other men who had joined I them. 1 The fatal disease now prevailing among horses in certain localities in Tennessee is becoming a very serious matter to horse ( owners. The general impression is that the ' disease is caused by rotten corn. The horses die in several hours after first being affected. The symptoms are like those of blind stag* [ gers. Seventy-five horses have died in one neighborhood in Wilson county. Mrs. Margaret J. Schraidtapp and her son, J. G. Schmidtapp, have tendered to the city of Cincinnati a memorial gift of $50,000, the interest of which is to be applied to giving free concerts on Sundays in Eden Park during the summer each year. But one condition is attached, that $25,000 additional shall be given by other parties. Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus W. Field, on Tuesday, celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of their marriage at their home in New York. A message of good will and good wishes was received from England. It was headed by the Duke of Argyle and Mr. Gladstone, and included over sixty names of men distinguish ed in every walk of life. On Wednesday, at Delphi, Indiana, Senator Turpie’s mother, aged 90 years, was burned to death. Her attendant had only been ab sent a few minutes, and upon her return found her lying near the fireplace burned to death. Isaac M. Jordan, one of the beat known members of the bar in Cincinnati, fell down the elevator shaft on Wednesday in the Lincoln Inn Court, Cincinnati, where his office is located, and was instantly killed. An Extraordinary Case. A dispatch from Lexington, Ky., says : •‘While sitting talking with her children at her home in Paris, Ky., about noon Wednes day, Mrs. J. Harry Brent felt the flexor mus cles of her right leg suddenly and violently contract, and as she screamed with pain the bone of the thigh broke just below the hip joint. A physician was summoned, but be fore he could do anything to relieve his pa tient her left leg broke in the same manner. Her sufferings are intense and her death is expected. Mrs. Brent is about forty years old, -the wife of a wealthy and prominent judge, and moves in the highest society. Physicians here say the case is unprecedented, that while bones have been broken by mus cular contraction, there has always been some well-defined cause, while Mrs. Brent has been apparently well. It is thought by her physician that she is a victim of muscular rheumatism.'* The strike of the coal miners of Alabama went into effect on Monday, but all the men did not go out as expected. Of the 8,000 free miners in the State it is estimated that 0,000 are out. A number of the mine opera tors are going to fill the places of the strikers with negroes. They expect eventually to operate their mines entirely with negro labor. Mrs. Lucy Wood, aged 105 years, living in Burre, Vermont, has sent a petition to Con gress for a pension. Her husband was a teamster in the war of 1812, and as the present law relating to the veterans of that I war does not include teamsters, she has i asked Congress for a special pension. rjtHE
