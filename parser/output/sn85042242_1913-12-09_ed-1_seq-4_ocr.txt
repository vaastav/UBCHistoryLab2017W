Meoober ot Associated' Press. flismarck, Tuesday, December 9, 1913 The Federal Primary Proposal The recommendation in the president's annual message." to Congress for federal primary law t0 .Vigovin the nomination of presidential and vice presi tfential candidates seems to have elicited the enthusi. asm of itfemoers of Congress from the Middle West. The correspondents were unable to get expressions from Senators from Southern states. The fact that these senators showed such consternation at the federal supervision of the election of United States Senators reserved in the recently adopted constitu­ tional amendment may furnish a key to their luke warmness over the, president's surprising proposal. There are certain peculiar conditions in the South with which the senators do not care to have federal tampering. Had the proposal come from a Repub­ lican president there would have not been such dis­ creet silence. A roar of indignation at the prospect of "force bills" would have been heard. Naturally, Speaker Clark applauds the suggestion. He can not dispel the rankling memory of the pro­ ceedings at Baltimore. He frankly states that had there been such a primary law in 1912 he would be president now. The elimination of conventions ex­ cept to draft and promulgate platforms especially appeals to him, for he recalls that the individual who encompassed his defeat at Baltimore, when his vote was at high tide, was under direct primary instruc­ tion from the voters of Nebraska to work for his nomination. The few Progressive members in Con­ gress indorse the proposal, although their indorse­ ment is accompanied by the intimation that the presi­ dent has retaliated on their hero'by collecting a part of his political wardrobe at the swimming hole. Al­ ready some of the members of Congress have rushed to their offices and dictated bills to carry,out the president's suggestion. The suggestion, aside from canstituency of the conventions to promulgate platforms, is characteris­ tically vague. Whether a mere plurality vote shall control, whether the first, second and third choice plan shall be a limitation placed upon expenditures by a candidate or by any individual or organization working in his behalf, whether the unorganized ter­ ritories shall be Ignored, whether the electoral vote of states shall be the basis of determining the na­ tional results and whether the state or the congres­ sional district shall be the unit are among the inter­ esting details for future consideration. If the pro­ posal should carry it might make the proposed extra­ ordinary Republican National convention useless. Whatever the bill might provide it would from neces­ sity do away with the two-thirds requirement of the Democratic National convention. It would ordinarily take two or three and perhaps half a dozen primaries to give any candidate a two-thirds vote. Whatever form the bill may take, its enactment, would insure the presidential nominations going to well advertised and well financed individuals. "And we are going to turn loose both barrels," shouts ex-Governor Stubbs. Eoth? Who owns the other one? Is This the Secret? From time to time there have appeared In the dally preifsi articles lauding the wisdom of President Wilson's IMexican policy, said wisdom being very closely related to that of the sages of whom Gratiano referred to when he spoke of those "who were reput­ ed wise tor saying nothing." 'Many of the presidents panegyrists have assumed that he is in possession of information which neither the general public nor even the Congress shares, and therefore his policy is statesmanlike to a turn and strategic to a degree. The only obstacle to the acceptance of these eulogies at their face value by the average citizen is his absolute inability to detect any tangible policy at all. There may be some occult "absent treatment," some astral application of the "pressure of moral force/' but so far as anything concrete is concerned ithe Wilson policy ..seems to be much like the snakes of IreEnrid—"there ain't any." At any rate, there is none visible. But at this juncture there appears in the columns of the daily press a story which may be the key to the mystery, the Ariadne thread to the labyrinth. There have been scattered statements to the effect thai President Huerta has been giving himself over to convivial habits. By way of Paris there came a •tory thai while keyed up under the influence of spir ttoas liquors, Huerta declared at a banquet that he could whip the "Gringoes" with one hand, and that ted it sot been for. the alleged treason of Santa Ana, sixty years or so ago, the Mexican northern twondaiy would now be the Great Lakes and Alaska. It the dictator is really drinking neavily and con* tteuously the end cannot be far off. Is that the master-key which unlocks all the mys­ teries ot the Wilson policies?- There is considerable to be saM for such patient strategy as this. It obvi­ ates the mobilisation, of armies, the assembling of •warships, the dangers of seasickness on the part of "rookies" and heel-blisters for the national suddenly tbrtttt into the thick of a Mexican ctdtoa jMert. perhaps that Is why Mr. Und is kept ca the seene—to report the progress of Huerta's iaaobaaallan progresa toward his finish. .Pertiaps that MWahy Dr. Hale breaks off negotiations occa* slonally with the rebels and why the secretary ot state holds a breathless consultation with his chief, so barren in typewritten statements of results accom­ plish*^ f*erbaps that is why there are so many ulti mat.ui^ and why thlf line so frequently appears in tl$ pifclc prints: "The administration Is waiting for Hitert® next move." Thtmjuch, at least, can be said for the policy of waiting until Huerta is "under the table"—It Is one way of accomplishing a desired result. Whether it Is the.^tjfllson way or whether this is only another guess wide of the truth will not be known until an­ other i|Uljnatum comes from Washington or Huerta'n long ana' patiently awaited move is made—perhaps not even then. No^dgubi. Colonel Roosevelt, appreciates the gift of an lAjgentine horse at Buenos Ayres, but he will continue to do most of his riding on his boobies. Marriage at Wholesale A ci^igyman at Wlaterbury, Conn., Is establishing a reputation for marrying couples at wholesale. Five bridal parties took the vows simultaneously at the altar of liis church one evening and the evening -be fore six couples were married with a single ceremony. .•The second ceremony nttracted the attention of the 'correspondents and l,he language used by the clergy­ man was included in the dispatches. He asked the assembled grooms: "Do you take these women for your lawful wives?" Without rehearsal the bass cho­ rus responded, "We do." Evidently Waterbury winds up its marriage ceremonies more quickly than it can its watches. But sticklers for form will attack the language of the ceremony as vague, indefinite, uncer­ tain and promiscuous. It has too great an appear­ ance o|wholesale polygamy. In fact, strictly speak­ ing, this., ceremony married them all to each other, like a kettle of fish. Each man married all six woin en, and *ach woman became the wife of each of the men. Certainly the question should be revised so that each groom shall be obligated to love and sup­ port some specific bride. It would more definitely fix responsibility. While marriage is such a solemn estate that there should be a decent regard for ceremony, there seems to be a wide variety of opinion as to just what form should he used. Clergymen of denominations having rituals: iisualiy follow the same, except where the contracting parties ask for some change in the word­ ing. TWrituals, if properly read or repeated, give an effee^of due solemnity. But captious critics find fault even with the most popular rituals. The best known^t-otestant marriage ceremony, on which oth. ers ar^ ,Qbviousy based, cites Rebecca as a mode} •wife. Yet it was a most unwifely trick she played on the blfald' and helpless Isaac when she aided her smooth-farced favorite to steal his, brother's blessing. In fac{, she proposed the swindle and furnished all the d€t£Tls. But he was an apt pupil and some of his -later achievements would- have filled the maternal bosom -with pride but for RebeccA'S^uiitftrfely deitti. Many-clergymen make up ceremonies of their own, which are a sort of ritualistic mosaic. Some surpass any particular ritual, while others are filled with absurdities. This is especially true of extempore ring cefapionies. The recent custom of using two rings hasT added to the difficulties. The justices of the peace have a wide choice of ceremonies, ranging from simplest exchange of vows to the most elaborate ritual, 'including even, "Whom God hath joined to­ gether let no man put asunder." The use of this in a civil ceremony is patently absurd. Bill Nye claimed that whan he was a justice of the peace in Wyoming he got J&round this by substituting his own name in the pl3ee$of the Lord's. But, after all, the ceremony is not the essential thing. What really counts is the mutual love and forbearance of the contracting par­ ties. B^the way, the Waterbury dispatch is silent as to one matter of importance In these expensive days*. It. does not state what reduction in fee is ir.a.It lor wholesale marriages. The woman niiffragists are highly indignant, but if the president will write a special message to congress recommending ballots for women all will be forgiven. The late Anthony N. Brady of New York left a fortune ,of $100,000,000. He was apparently so frugal in his habits that he did not. even employ a press agent. Mrs. Prendergast of New York, like multitudes of Progressives in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and oth­ er states, has simply grown tired of keeping up a Democratic aid society. The helpful hen doesn't care a cackle who fixes the prices of her product, just so she is not crowded too much in her laying habits. Seventy-cent eggs or 7-cdtat eggs, it's all the same to her. Champ Clark advises boys to "stick to the farm and keep out of politics." By so doing they can escape the mortification of being cheated out of any presidential nomination that rightfully belongs to tliem. 3SS President Wilson's lack of faith in party conven­ tions Is easily understood. He distinctly remembers a party?-\sonventlon at which not only the will of the party, tt the preference of the delegates were over­ ridden by. political trickery. At the special session of congress more thap 12, 000. bill* and resolutions were introduced, most of them merely to impress constituencies that' their members were actively at work saving the cbuntf The following extracts from his speeches deliv­ ered at Buenos Ayres and at Santiago, Chile, give Coionfef^Fioosevelt's theory of the Monroe doctrine: "The Monroe doctrine Is a thing of the past." "The 'Monroe,.^octrine is not dead. It is more alive than ever."' ^Wholly consistent, as usual. .•:T Th'#'$pmen in charge of the local boycott on high priced1 e^gs explain fait the boycott is not to apply to frefjuveggs, but only to the cold storage variety. Of coufgf}, no grocer ever offers eggs for sale that are not"^EtrlctJy fresh," and, of course, the average consumer can tell at a glance which egg is fresh and Vhlcl^'iff'cold storage.
