The German BMd In the North Sen. The raid upon the Yorkshire coast sy n squadron of German cruisers has ;he unpleasant significance for the Kngllsh ieoplo that the navy, which Is their chief reliance and bulwark, can neither keep the North Sea clear of the unemy's warships nor prevent attacks upon coast towns. The patrol Is In adequate, for It Is possible to catch he fleet napping; and the protection afforded Is far from what It should be, for German shells have been thrown Into Scarborough. Hartleiwol and Whitby, killing and wounding a number of the inhabitants and doing considerable damage to buildings. The mischief wad done before units of the patrolling fleet could get up, and all England, ..1th visions of other and more destructive raids, and possibly the landing of troops under the en fiuy'a guns. Is naturally In a panicky Ktate. Tho despatches say that the raiding uhlps were engaged before they could return to their base. Whatever the result of the encounter turns out to be, tho German navy has demonstrated Its ability to come out of Its "hole," run the gantlet of the North Sea pa trol and turn Its guns on the seaport towns of the east coast of England. If u few embers can do this under cover of night or in thick weather, the line of battle ships, seizing an opportunity when the patrolling fleet has been scat tered by storm, can emerge from the mouth of the Elbe or steam through the Skagerak. and In compact forma tion seek an engagement. Should it result In favor of the German fleet the whole east coast of England would be open to Invasion. There Is another aspect of the case that must be giving the llritlsh Admi ralty concern. While Germany may not be willing to risk a general en gagement In the North Sea, the de scent on the Yorkshire coast suggests tho possibility of a raid by a swift nnd powerful squadron In the waters of the Atlantic along the routes of England's merchant fleet carrying Immense car goes of xood and war supplies. It may b said that the Atlantic has Its own patrol of British warships, nut obvi ously If the Hrltlsh navy cannot make ti closed sea of the North Sea or Ger man Ocean there must be plenty of room In the Atlantic for the operations of a German flying squadron. Tho yame would be worth the risk, for a tremendous amount of damage could be done to tho nrltlsh merchant ma rine. The traffic so Taluablo to Eng land herself nnd so necessary to the cause of the Allies might bo deranged and tied up. If not temporarily ruined. A I'nt Year on tho Farms. Reckoned In round numbers tho ag grogitte farm value of the fourteen principal agricultural products of tho year Just reported on by the Washing 'in Hureau of Crop Estimates was T-1,010,000,000 at tho beginning of I)e--vnuber. This was $20,000,000 less rlinn the corresponding tlgure a year ,igo, but the country need not concern Itself very much about the disparity. The crops Included range from corn down to sugar becK Were It not for tips damage which the war has dono t the cotton trado the aggregate value : all the staples In question would Lave been fully $ I. -10.000,000 greater titan at this time last year, but as it It, American agriculture has had a splendid season and the results of It form a solid basis on which to raise iitii'W the structure of American busi ness activity. Over large areas Ihe prosperity of the tanning community and of all com nullities to which It contributes Is as Hired, A large purclialng power of nsrlciiltunil yields Is guaranteed by market values which rule above the fjnn values oflielally assigned. The crop grower Is getting good prices for his products, regarding tho aggregate of crops as ,i whole, but what Is more to the point, prices nro uot the result of dellclency. It is of Infinitely greater ennse qtwncG for farmer and consumer allko, for all Industry anil trade, tbat there ahould be an abundance of agricultural commodltlos than that they should ob tain skyscrnplng prices. As a matter of fact prices are high for moot products of tho farm, but It 1b not because of a t-hortngo In our own land. Ordinarily ultocether too much Is mode of tho dol. lnr value of crops In offlclnl summaries: the Important thing Is that In lull the Htnple output of the farms was huge. At least two of the year's crops, wheat and cotton, were of huttip-r proportions measured only by Usurps which constitute a new record. In order to pet quantitative totals for comparative purposes nil the various pounds, bushels, bales uml tons may lie added together as so many units of yield. Thus added the production of the fourteen crops under consideration reach an nppresatc of C,.1S7,000,000 units, compared with 0,037.000,000 last year, an Increase of 650,000.000. In other words. In the present year of need the American farm yielded a handsome Increase of commodities, and the foregoing tale of the harvest, which Is only half of the farm story, Is a prophecy of better business all around. Street Crossing Under Tennlty The latest proposal for an nrtlfl- clal crime to be added to our already Ko'inewhut copious list Is made hy l'o Hco Commissioner Woods. He hopes to be authorized soon to arrest etery one who crosses a street or avenue diago nally or anywhere between the Intersec tions of thoroughfares. The Idea Is not absolutely new. They have such an ordinance In Washington. It became known early In llil.'l through President Wilson's Inadvertently running foul of It. Mr. Woons says It exists In sundry Western towns and reduces the number of personal mishaps therein. I'erhaps the plan would seem more attractive If any degree of safety ex isted at the crossings, so called, ns dis tinguished from any other localities. Hut except at the relatively few Inter sections where traffic policemen are sta tioned there Is absolutely no distinction In favor of the crossings ns compared with the middle or any other part of the block. The pedestrian has no rights anywhere except that of skipping out of the way when the horn toots. Car motormen. chauffeurs, drivers of horses show exactly the same disregard In ap- proachlng the crossings that they do lu every other part of their gay career, j It would seem as If the primary re quirement for safety In New ork streets must be the hammering of soma degree of regard for the mere public afoot Into the tough heart of the nun in the devil wagon. So long as man killing machines will neither slow down nor swerve for man, woman or child, for age or Infirmity, so long as tho whole duty of the speeder Is to toot and speed on. It Is useless to talk of safety measnres to be carried out by pedes trians. People afoot must only stand and wait for a fair chance, then dah for shelter between onsets of danger. Sometimes this can bo done ns well or better In the middle of a block than at the corner. At least the problem Is not complicated by converging menaces of uncertain and unguessable dlrtvtlon. The ordinance proposed by Mr. Woons would unquestionably result In vexa tion and humiliation for occasional ac cidental victims. It would oppress the few without benefiting the many. It would have no broad remedial effect, as nine people out of ten would pay no heed to It. Anyway, It Is nn attack on an undoubted evil from absolutely the wrong nngle. Non-Importation and Ntn-Kpor-tatioti Acts. President Wilson's suggestion or rc- I quest that loans be not made by Anier ' Icmu bankers to Mllgoront Govern ! tnents and that a contract for supply lng parts of submarines to a belligerent !bo annulled has the effect If not the form of an Executive order for a lim ited embargo, or prohibition of com merce. He did not wait for Congress to emiwwer him to lay an embargo. The Inhibition of foreign loans was practically au Inhibition, to the amount of the loan, of American eorts. Cer tain members of the Congress are eagi r to prohibit the exportation of arms, munitions, even general supplies, food and clothing. To uny American, and especially to any Democrat, tho word ''embargo" must have a melancholy sound. It re calls n period of military weakness and of ruinous economics on the part of tho United States, a shuttlecock between Franco and Great Britain. The Demo cratic party, at first Republican of name, was mainly composed of farmers, Jealous and Ignorant of commerce. .Itr ikrhon's own early Ideal, which per haps he never got entirely oor, whl'e admitting Its Impossibility, was that tho States should practise uelther commerce nor navigation." Hy tho fa mous or Infamous embargo act of 1807 and Its supplement of 1MIS be succeeded unintentionally In making Ills theory fact. Foreign commerce was forbidden. No foreign vessel at an American port could take specie or cargo. Even coast traders had to give lwnd not to dis charge their freight at a homo port. The foreign I'owers against whom these supiwsed reprisals were taken were not Injured or were but slightly Injured. Our exports fell from $110,000,000 odd In 1S07 to ?2L',00O,oimi In 1S0S. The merchant class of the Northern seaports and East were ruined. New England was driven to tho edge of soce-sloti. Unemployment was the rule, Tho farming Interest felt the cessation of demand for their products, Natolion was tickled, Meanwhile tho navy had been neglectisl, Wo need not follow the vain substi tutes and modllloatlotis, the non-lutcr-course act or tho susioiislon and revivi fication of a restrictive policy. At last the country determined on a war that should have been undertaken lung be fore uud for which not Great Hrllaln nlono had given nioro than ample cause. President .Madison was driven Into It, and we know the rest, though we may have forgotten that another embargo act was shipped on In 18111 ami re pealed In LSI I. Tho purpose of this prohibition, par tial or total, was to hamper French or Hrltlsh commerce or both. The res ill was to damage or ruin our own com incico uud Industry, If this unhappy biting off one's nose to spltu ouo's fa cu Is hero very lightly touched on, It is because there are actually men nt Washington ono of them esteemed very wise who -wish to I n J u ro tho commerce of this country now, and not even for its supposed ben efit, hut for the benetlt of n foreign country or under the Illusion that tho I.'nlted States should sacrifice n part of Its legitimate business for a dreamed of promotion of "peace." It Is curious that the non-Importation act of April 18, 1800, for bidding tho entry of certain articles from (Jreat Hrltnln, Is tho parallel In a sense of the bjlls now before Con gress forbidding the salo to belliger ents of contraband of war or some nrtlcles thereof. How Mr. McAdoo .Saves .Money. When Secretary McAnoo made his annual estimate of tho ntnount needed to pay the (Jovernment's expenses for 1015-ltl, the total was stated nt $1,001). 000.000. a reduction of $18,000,000 from tho estimates for the current year. Upon the strength of this npparent de crease considerable Democratic telf- congratulation was Indulged in, nnd tho Administration's activities In behalf of economy drew praise from all sides. Hut when the Legislative, Executive and Judicial tdll was reiorted to the House, Representative Giixett of Mas sachusetts, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, called attention to the manner In which this apparent reduction was obtained, and the fact that It Is wholly theoretical : "The Secretary of the Treasury tells us pane 5S of his report that the estimate for tho postal service under existing laws Is (3:0.000,000. but tt the legislation rec ommended by the department Is enacted tho coet will be only $297,000,000, a av lnc of 123,000,000. "Ho refer, I suppose, to tho chance from rural carriers to star route service, and accordingly, In the book of estimates, he figures the cost of the postal service .! 1297,000,000. "Under exletlnr law. whlc.'i 1 the basis on which the estimates fhould be flfrured, that should be (23,000,000 larger, and the apparent reduction of US, 000,000 over last year ts wiped out, und these estimates supplant thofp of last year as the lareest sum any Administration hns ever asked any Congress to appropriate." .Mr. Gii.t.r.rr was Interrupted nt this Iolnt by Representative Stai-ford of Wisconsin, and this dialogue ensued "Mr. Stafford Is the gentleman aware of the fact that the Post OMlw CommHte baa reported a bill negativing the recom mendation of the department and appro priates a total of S322.000.000? "Mr. OiLLRTT I was not aware of that fact, but 1 was perfectly confident tt would bo the fact. If the gentleman says tt Is $322,000,000. there Is 125,000.000 already reported larger on the Post Olllco bill than It Is (Atlmatcd for So that the estimates, Instead of being U. 000,000 les than last jvar, aro really 

J7.00O.O0O larger, and that In this period of stress and depression." That Is, the McAdoolan postal esti mate was baed. not on the Govern ment practices, but on a new system not In use and exceedingly unlikely ever to he put Into operation. The total was reduced for purposes of pub lication, but Isire no relation to the sums to be expended. The Administra tion received without noticeable mod esty what praise was forthcoming, conscious that tt constituted a desir able political possession, hut nil the while knowing that no appropriation whatever would be affected by the little wile.

And Gum Shoe Hill got a telegram from the President saying: "I want you to know that I do this wl'h warmest affection for you and the confi dent hope that you will understand." Understand? Of course Gum Shoe Hill will understand I Hut the humili ation of It!

A war tax of 1100,000.000 has been Im posed upon us and further taxes for the like purpotio may bo expected unless tho war la brought to nn early close. There fore It Is to our Interest that the war Do brought to the speediest possible end. The more material wo sell to the belligerents for taking human llfo the longer the war will last. If we should abetaln from sell ing to any belligerent, no matter who they are, ammunition and material for tailing life, for creating widows and or phans, and for fncrens.ng the misery of tho people of countries with whom wo are at peace, the war mny be brought to an earlier termination What does the principle contained In the dictum that It Is the right of the neutral to supply either belligerent with arms and ammunition mean in our case at this time?

To 'the Editor or Tub Sun Sir; Miss Je-sslo Lee Dennett read at the Washington niee-tlng of tho American Civic Association a paper on "Tho Passing of the Signboard." It was pleacant to learn ithat "In tho last two years a great ileal has bcon accom plished in the light against signboards" and 1 earnestly hope that tho next two years will bring greater auccess to the ennniaiirn for the restriction and regula- latlon of this hideous nuleance; but when It is remembered that tho farmer receives payment for tho signs In his nelds and the adveitlsemer.'.e on his barns and fences, the hope of restriction and regulation In these particular quarters become very faint. He-aides It Is a worldwide cu."tom, and had this laiy extended her observation beyond local limits she would realize that her ilescrlpt'on of elgnboartls as "essen tially AmerlJun. a proof of a most prodi gally vigorous race which could have evolved or endured anything eo blatantly nerve racking," was a great error. Dis play advertising with us la still In Its In fancy. The mas of advertising tn Lon don, for Instance, la positively bewildering and wearisome- In the extreme. The motor buses there are covereel with glaring signs of every e-oncelvable e-olor ami stylo. So are the noais on me Thames, and on Its sliorea great signs aro In abundance. The sldowalks show chalk Incs In many colors nnd so-called sidewalk artists aro permitted to adorn the flags with their crude drawings no the means of obtaining pennies from the passers by. The railroad motions throughout Great Urltaln are simply masses of advertising and many of the nearby buildings arc used to display glgnntio ll.irlng sign boards, largely devoted to advertising dlf feu it brands of whiskey or certain aperi ent patent medicines. Tho boats on he Seine carry many ad vert.slng signs, and In tho fluids along tome of the pr.ncipal hues of travel In Franco nro nur.y tlnrlng signs like thos W-- n. familiar wlih In our own fllds. This style of a ivertlslng extends to the Fur Ln.it and signboards are seen almost everywhere one travels. The craze for electric light advertising has eprtad over the world Theatre street In Yokohama, with Its multitude of passing- people In a blazp of light, reminds one of the "Great White Way." which name, by the way. Is locally applied to th prin cipal street tn Chrlstlanla. Norway, on account of Its electrical display Toklo in a wonder of electrical display and the mreets of the Yoshlwara district at night are like noon on a bright day In July The electrical display last summer In th evtenslve grounds of the exhibition we s wonderful. ehanghal, Pekln. Harbin. Port Arthur. Chang Chun and the towns tn Corea blaze u h electilc light advertising So do Honolulu and Vancouver, while the cities and towns along the Canadian Pad lie nake great rthsplays. Another matter that In this country Is considered to be peculiarly an American trait Is the passion for marking one's name In public jlace-s. A Journey to the North Cape, Norway, would show this to be an unfounded aspersion on our people, fir there on the face of the stupendous rscl. can be seen the Kaiser's name painted In l.ugo white letters, with the date of hla visit great bronze tablet bearing fte Kal ser'a nam Is HfllxcsJ to the walls of cne of the ruined temples of the Aotopolls of HaaJbsk. Syria, commemorating his visit there i.nd s ating that he had made cer tain excavations In and about that an-cl- nt trueture. The Italians are great slnneri In this n-flpect The walls of the ramp leading to tho roof ' S! I'oter's, Home, are cov ered w-th pencilled names, a large ma jor ' of which are easily recognized as Ital.an names ; and there- ts a large sprink ling of German names In the crept of the Cappuclnt (or S, Maria della Concezione), Home, the church of the one powerful Harherlnl fa mil v. where there are several ehape entirely constructed of the bones of the monks (altars, wall decorations and chancel rail ings), many of the polished skulls of the long dead fathers, whlah are used as the toi of the bone railings, bear pencilled names, mostly of Italians We are crude In certain ways, hut In the muter of display advertising and peneilling of names In public places we am not yet in ihe front rank O.

Through Its oMIcial org-Jli, the AIHnn.ee, Nrics, It called upon its friends "to exert themselves to discover nil tha Instances posslblo" of total abstainers who lived to tie 00 years and upward Tho result wns far from gratifying to the prohibitionists. After a six weeks Investigation made by thou sands of thn total extremists, ecuttcred over the whole of Orent llrltaln, but the surh c.ij'S were discovered. It Is a matter of history that very few really great men wero total abstainers. Men of character and ability, like Glad stone, Asqulth and Snllsbury; giants of Intellect like Carlylo, Macaulay, Tennyson, Hisinnrek, Milton, Shakespeare, Luther, Hunan, Wellington, Pitt, Socrates, Na poleon, Darwin.
