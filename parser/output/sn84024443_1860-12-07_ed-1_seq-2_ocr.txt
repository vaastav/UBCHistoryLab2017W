The Bill providing for the assembling of a Convention of the people of Missis sippi, to consider her relations with the Federal Government, has passed both Houses of the Legislature by a unani mous vote. . . Misrepresentation. A despatch from Columbia, So., Ca., says that one Mr. Bilbo made a speech in that place, and said that Tennessee would follow South Carolina out of the Union in thirty days. For the last two years Bilbo has been delving for dross among the mountains of North Carolina, uud profoundly ignorant of public sentiment in Tennessee upon that or any other ques tion. In the event the Union is dissolv ed, the natural position of Tennessee ' will be with her sister Southern States; but Itinerant and vagrant orators who rep resent that Tennessee is ready to follow . South Carolina in her precipituto retreat into independent nothingness, or that , there is any party in tho State for Seces sion, falsify the truth and slander the in' . tcgrity and patriotism of the people. Ten ,,neaea will take no hasty step she will neither follow nor be forced into "precip itation." You are wrong, Mr. Bilbo, to "ths extent of -tho whole truth. "' .' No Backing Out. - .

Pettua, of Mississippi, in bis mu. sage to the Legislature propose a reme dy for the evils which affliot that Com monwealth. Wt, quote Ilia Kxcellrno as follows: . "Our deliverance from this great dan ger, in tny opinion, is to bo found in the reserved rights of the Slates to withdraw from injury and oppression, which was retained by those who formed this Gov- ernment, for just such an emergency as wits, r.mbouied in the reserved rights of the States, is the soul of American liberty the great saving principle to which idone the Southern States onn tank and tit. This saving principle must perish under Black Republican rule. Then go down into Kgypt while Horod reigns in Judcn; t Is the only means of saving the life of this Kmanuct of American politics, and when in after year it shall bo told you, that they who sought the life of this l'rinee of I'eace anil fraternity are dead, you may come up out of Kgypt, and real ize all the fond hopes of patriots and sages, of peaoe on earth and good will among men, mnlcr the benign influence of a re-united Government deriving its just powers from the consent of the gov erned." This going "down into Kgypt" involves a good djnl of travel across the country at that as well as some confusion in mat ters of history. "Herod, tho tetrarch," reigned something over eighteen hundred years ago. But the Union is worth the trouble and expense of this unexpected journey. I.el sus "go Into Kgypt," or anywhere, to save the country. But the distinguished geographer and historian offers a plan for protecting the property of his constituents during this Hegira, in the following words: "I recommend that an act be passed staving the bringing of suits and the col lection of debts by execution sides, until the closo of the next regular session of the Legislature." By which timo the children of Missis sippi will hnve returned from their joui neyings in the wilderness. This tempo rary repudiation of debts might revive a morbid appetite in that State. Their bonds, of which we have heard so much, went "down into Egypt," and have never been able to get back. From Washington. H'.iiiiiytoa, Dec. 3 P. M. Several South ern delegations aro in secret consultation to-night with the object it is believed of securing the co-operation of the bonier slave States in the secession movement. Whiln RiMo Iicnulilicf5is ofWt. to be lieve that South Carolina only will secede, others are beginning to bo alarmed; even Sumner to-day said privately that there wus danger of the secession movement spreading. Tho President's message will, it is thought, oflend tho South on account of its position against secession and offend tho North by its condemnation of the personal liberty bills. Persons claiming to be well posted soy that the President will recommend a gen eral convention with a view to the adjust ment of tho presentditKculties. It is evident that the Administration fears ti-oublo in tho enforcement of the Federal laws. Notwithstanding there was a studied courtesy and cordiality to-day, between the members from the extreme sections of tho confederacy, a close observer could uot fuil occasionally to observe flashes of indignation from those from the Cotton States foretelling tho coming storm. Out of Employment. It is estimated that not less than thirty thousand people have been thrown out of employment in the City of New York alone since the Presidential election, ma ny of whom will be driven to crime and prostitution to keep gaunt famine from their door. The Georgia Convention. We liml tho following in an Atlanta paper of the 28th ult: The bill from the Senate authorizing the call of a Convention of tho IVonln passed the House of Kepresentativcs yes terday by a unanimous vote. It provides that 1111 election of delegates shall be held in the different counties on tho iirst vteunesiiuy in January: that each coun ty having two Representatives in tho Legislature shall bo entitled to thrnnrb.l. egates, and thoso counties having 0110 Representative shall be entitled in iu,r. delegatot. Tho Convention is to moot at tho Capitol on the 10th day of January 1801, and the nrr ticm and mileni.e nf ), delegates shall be the same as members of the Legislature. The Kansas Baid. ' Tho Kansas raid is said to have been caused by tho attempt of tho Govern ment authorities to force illegal settlers off the Indian Reservations. A collision occurred between tlieso squatters and the Government troops, and this, according to otHcial advices received by the War Department, was the origin of the whole dithculty. Ihe squatters had been dal lying on the Indian Reserves for many months since they were ordered to re move, in the hope of being allowed to re main there under the Lincoln Adminis tration. They allege that they were in .formed by Abolitionists from the Kast that this would bo the case. Meeting at Nashville. A meeting ot all parties was held at Nashville on the 1st, and the following resolution adopted: Jtitotceil, As the sense of this meetinir that in view of the present dangerous crisis in our affairs tho Governor of the State be and he is hereby requested to cuii logciuer lis j.egislatura forthwith, that they may provido for a State Con. vention, to be elected by the people; the object 01 wuicii suau ue to oringatiouta conference of Southern States, to consid er existing political troubles anil, if poi siblo, to compose our sectional strifes. .

Financial and Commercial. , From the New York Herald. V . THirRshAT, Tov. 20 0 P. M. This being Thanksgiving Day no busi ness Was transacted in Wall street, and business offices were closed. ' From the South we hear that, as was expected, tho Charleston banks have sus pended specie payments. Theso banks arc good enough, and will bo ablo to pay all their noteholders and depositors in full as 10011 as the movement in cotton revives. The St. Louis banks hare like wise been compelled to suspend specie payments. The Committee f Ways and Meins In the South Carolina Legislature have re ported against raising money in the pies cnt emergency by taxation, and have recommended an issue of State, bonds. The present debt of the State, as specified in the report of the Attorney General just laid before the Legislature, is $4. 40ft,. 000, being an increase of about $1,300,000 since last year. This debt is mostly held in tho State and in Kuropc. The bulk of it consists of five and s:x per cent, bonds, which, until the recent revolu tionary proceedings, stood at near par in the Louder, market. Here they are un known. The question now arises, will the new issue of bonds command a ready sale? Can they bo recommended as an investment to capitalists? If South Car olina were to remain in the confederacy, and her commercial and agricultural re sources were in a fair way of being peace fully develoed, we see no reason why a further issue of bonds to the extent of a million or so, should not command a good price in the financial markets of the world. According to the letter wo received the other day from a leading director of one of the Charleston banks, the State will produce this year $'2i,000, 000 worth of cotton, rico, turpentine, Ac. Allowing that this estimato was twenty per cent, over the mark, we still have an annual production of ?20,000,000. On this basis the State could well afford to owe five or six millions if it were cer tain that no expenses would bo incurred beyond the ordinary cost of supporting a white population of less than 300,000, and about as many slaves. But if South Car olina is to embark in a revolutionary war, the case, in the opinion of capi talists, will perhaps not be so clear. It is understood, at present, that the United Stntei will not iuc force to retain South Carolina in tho Union. But oven if tho naked right of seces sion be conceded by the general gov ernment, in order to avoid the calam ity of civil war, there would still remain a number of nice questions to be adjusted between this country and South Carolina, which might lead to an interruption of peaceable intercourse. No practical scheme has been suggested for the divis ion of tho national debt; for the parti tion of the national territories; for the transfer of the national property within the territory of South Carolina; for the settlement of the Fugitive Slave question after secession, Ac, Ac. In the even of the recognition by tho United States of tho independence of South Carolina, all these matters would have to bo set tlod, and it is hardly likely that they could bo settled without angry contro versies. If these controversies became so embittered as to lead to war, the secu rities of South Carolina would not stand very high in tho financial world. War would of course do great mischief in tho North; hut it would likewise involve the blockado of Charleston, and consequent ly the stoppage of the export of cotton, rico and turpentine; where in this case, would bo tho $20,000,000 of annual pro ducts? Where would tho planters get corn to feed their slaves? These ore mut ters which capitalists will be likely to consider before they purchase the bonds which South Carolina proposes to issue. We should be glad to recommend them as an investment, because we believe that the people of South Carolina un like the people of some other States are imbued with a high sense of honor which would provent their attempting to shirk their debts. But before they can be recommended to capitalists, it is ab solutely necessary that the public should be acquainted with the probable amount which the State will require to issue, and the probable means which will be forth coming for the payment of the interest. It is urged by tho Committee of Ways and Means that the people of the State Bhould come forward patriotically and tuke the bonds. This is more romantic than practical. State bonds can only be sold at great financial centres, where men of means congregate in search of save investments. In agricultural States capitalists are rare; people in South Caro lina, who have money, want it for the purchase of land, negroes and machinery. At the present timo, especially, the op peal to the South Carolina planters and men of means is ill timed. The mer chants are in great distress; the soundest among them are seeking extensions. The banks aro on the eve of suspension The planters are getting but 8, cent for cotton, which, but for the present agita tion, they would have sold for 12 cents, Trade is paralyzed, anil great distress prevails throughout the Suite. Surely, at such a time as this it is gratuitous to expect people to take revolutionary bonds. Opinions of Virginia Congressmen. Tho Lynchburg Virginian says Hon. Sherrard Clemens, of the Wheeling dis trict, in Vs., comet out in letter to his constituents, deprecating in the strongest terms the action of South Carolina, which he culls "hot and indecent." The speech of Hon. J. T. Harris, at Rockingham Court, on Monday week, is said to have been an able one, taking strong ground in favor of sustaining the Uuion. Tbe people of Rockingham are re ported as nearly all Anti-Secestionibts. I'he Representative, of this Putrict, Hon. Tbos. S. Bocock, la also very con servative in his sentiments so with the llou.

Secession Meeting in Winchester, Tennessee. Probably the first out and out disunion meeting ever held in this State cam off In Winchester on the 20th, as we learn from a correspondent. Notice had been given by Messrs. p. Turney and M. Tur ney fliat they would speak on "Secession, the Duty and Prospects of the South." It being the first day of Circuit Court, the attendance was large. Our correspondent says 1 "Their speeches were of on inflamma tory ehnrncter, abusing Lincoln and the Black Republican party, insisting that immediate secession by teymrale -Stale action, before Lincoln's inauguration, was our only remedy. They lay much stress on trparate State action, taking ground against a general Southern Convention, and against a Slate Convention, saying we have not timo. They are evidently post ed, and acting in concert witb tho South Carolina movement. "They praise South Carolina and say she is clearly right, and we must go with her. They take the ground that the Union is already dissolved by tho action ?c'!i0 Nort,"'rn States, which have nul lified the fugitive slave luw. "After they got done, Col. A. S. Colvor made a speech against secession, and'es pecially against the precipitato action of South Carolina, ond in favor of a State Convention, to be gotten up by a called session of the Legislature. Col. C. pressed the point that South Carolina was doing us a great wrjQg by seceding without ronsulli2JeC. ISJa with the border States; tWit it was an attempt to involve those States in a revolution against their will, nnd that South Carolina was unwil ling to abide the calm and dehberuto de cision of the whole South. "At tho conclusion of Col. C.'s remarks he announced that thero would bo an other meeting on Wednesday, when ho would further discuss these ques tions, and that it was also dosirable that steps be taken urging tho Governor to conveno the Legislature to order a Convention and to consider of the coining question. "This days work opened the eyes of the people. Many of them say that they did not expect so bold a move so soon, and a new utue is emphatically before the people of this country. I was surprised to sec the readiness of the greut mass of tho Democracy to lay down party affini ties and stand by the Union." Suspension of Debts. The bill to grant relief to the banks and people of this State, passed the Senate yesterday by a vote of ninety-two to fif teen. Its provisions arc; 1. Repeals so much of the act of 1857 n forbids the banks of this State from sending their nofes out of tho State for the purpose of discounting drafts. 2 Repeals so much of said act as pre vents the banks frtm selling any but sight checks. 8. Suspends the oprrotion of all acts inflicting pains nnd forfeitures on the bunks and their ollieers, by reason of non payment of specie for their notes. 4. Prohibits the levying of any fi. fa. in favor of the suspended banks rim ing such suspension, and of any if. fa. against tho banks during the timo their debtors nre thus protected, provided thut the de fendant in either case shall give security, as is now required for tho stay of execu tion. 5.

No Precipitation. It is tho duty of every friend of the South and of South Carolina, to use his utmost efforts to restrain that Stato from secession. Tho Southern people, are far from being united, and anarchy would bo inevitable from the attempt to precipi tate them into revolution. There is no necessity for secccssion up on the election of Lincoln. Lot the worst be conceded to his administration nnd every step will only tend to consoli date the South, and when the Georgia platform is violated by the Federal Gov ernment our "wise, moderate, just," old Commonwealth will move wi'tu South Carolina. In the meantime, if e anticipate evil, prudence dictates that we should pre pare to meet it. Let each Southern State follow the example of Virginia in her militury preparations. Let every en couragement possible, he given to South ern industry, and safety independence will inevitably follow. The above is from tho Marietta States man, a paper which supported Mr. Breck inridge. Conflict Begun. The New York correspondent of the Nutionol Intelligencer, says 1 Upon several branches of manufactur ing the panic has operated disastrously. There is a general stagnation, and it is estimated that the number of persons, male and female, thrown out of em ployment Is twenty-five thousand. The clothing trade is suffering seriously, many orders from the South and West, oiven before the election, having been counter manded. One lai'o firm in Broadway has discharged one thousand hands, ana throe houses in Dey stioet havo likewise tiisoiiavgcu most ot tlieir hands. From Charleston. Ciartetton, Nov. 20. It it deemed prob ablo hero Mr. Yancey will be apjiointed by tho Alabama Legislature, as Commis sioner to attend the South Carolina Con vention. It is now considered certain hero that the ordinance of secession will bo passed either on the 17th or lHth of December. Our Representatives are leaving for Washington. Ordnance and ammunition havo lately been landed from a schooner at Fort Moultrie. Some of the army ollieers say mat now r ort mouitrio is almost im- pregnublo. Tiis Popular Vote The Albany Argus says Mr. Douglas has received in the free States alone more than thirteen hundred thousand votes. This is one hundred thousand moro votes than Buchanan re ceived in 1H50. He has about as strong a vote in the free States ns Fremont hud in 1850. Ho has more votes in the free States than there wcro polled for all can didates combined in the slave States. Mr. Toombs, uncompromising, fire- devouring Mr. Toombs, is understood to be in favor of a government like that of England with kings and queens, lords and great ladies, a large national debt, tithes, taxation, and all the pride, pomp, and circumstanoe of royalty and privi leged orders. "Columbia" is to be the name of the new Kingdom. We hope there will be no quarrel between Toombs and Yancey as to which shall first grasp and wield the royal sceptre. Union Rpcicu. Hon. John J. Critten den mude an eloquent speech, a fow days ago, in Kentucky, against secession, and in favor of the Union. . Word to the National Democracy vi xeunesseo, We have heretofore refused to urge our friends to attend the proposed State Na tional Democratic, Convention, to be held at Nashville on the 8th of January next, because We have regarded the movement as entirely premature. In tho present disordered status of political affairs, when the Federal Government is upon the brink of an imminent dissolution we have thought proper to engage ourselves with weightier matters than keeping up the organization of a more political party. The timo which will elapse between the present month and the period for the usual gubernatorial election, will bo am ply autticient in which to take steps to- noius iiiitKiiig nvniiauie ona appropriate nominations for State ollieers. It is im. possible for us to anticipate the future of panics in 1110 country or the issues which may be evoked by tho emergencies of the present. We therefore would venture to ad vise tiie postponement of this move ment upon our individual resKhsibility, and without pretending to speak ns the organ ot any set of men or parly. Our thoughts or party success, ought at least for a time, to be swallowed un in consid erations vlnii-litcrititercstsnnd of greater moment. We submit the suggestion to the calm and sober reflection of our political tnemls. Memphis Appeal. Battlesnakes and Secession Flasrs. Tho Macon (Ga.) Telegraph is not pleased with those proposed devices for State flags in which the rattlesnake is made prominent. It says t The snake, from the days of Adam to tho present time, by the common consent of mankind, has been held to emblemize low cral't, deceit and cunning, moral and physical degradation, malignity, and finol ly that impersonation of all that is vile Milan himself I But, notwithstanding all this, South Carolina has a snake colonial Georgia a snake and now Alabama is go ing to havo a snake, too. Are we to be a Snuke Republic altogether? Are the heavens above and the teeming earth nround us so destitute or striking and significant emblems of a noble moral nnd physical energy that we must nil burrow in dens and caves in swamps and mo rasses for snakes t If so, let us vary the species a littlo. Your rattlesnake tnVea to his legs no, to his belly at tho sight of ,i.u iMiig-siiuKe, aim never stops till the royal reptile has him in his fatal folds. lie is a dead snake so soon ns the king snake gets sight of him. Did you ever think of that and its significance to a rattlesnake Ih-pMicf In the long run, where snakes nre plenty, we would bet on 11 copperhead or water moccasin against any of the rattling species. Further more, the whole fumily of snakes dis gustingly remind us of the threats of .umner and Seward, or driving slavery "like a snake to its hole, where it willstins itself to death." Secession. Tho Mississippi Constitutional Union, discussing the subject of Secession and the disposition manifested in some sec tions to run away from the blessings they enjoy and fly to evils they know not of, forcibly remarks : "But man is a strange compound. Ho is frequently most dissatisfied when do ing well. We are informed that our first parent niter his creation was placed in a beautiful garden, prepared by God him self, surrounded with everything calcula ted to please the senses; in a word, a for tune, such a one us none of his children ever possessed was given him, yet with all these blessings ho beeamo dissatisfied, and actually seceded from his Creator and Benefactor. Tho consequence was he lost nil, was driven from Paradise, become subject to sin and death. Ho be came dissatisfied with the government of his Maker, rebelled, seceded, if you please, risked all and lost all. We might men tion many other cases in the history of our race, that most fitly applies to the men of our times, but enough for the present. New York. The paragraph below is from tho New York correspondent of tho Charleston Cou rier: "The return by jour steamers of such large numbers of poor steerage passengers, who are thus thrown without resources upon us in the midst of winter, is the cause of very serious reflection to the Re publicans. They begin to see that there are really two sides to the "benefits" of Lincoln's election. If the laboring class es in this city cannot obtain employment this winter, thero are only two niter na tives left them starvation and suicide, or lives of robbery and crime. It is terriblo to think of whut miseries are in store for tho thousands of helpless women and children of the metropolis. Oov. Houston Befuses to Convene the Texas Legislature. Xcw Orleans, Dec. 1. A committee of citizens of Texas petitioned Gov. Hous ton to convene the Legislature. The Governor responded, that viewing the proposed measure as unwise, he could not call the Legislature together; but if a majority of tho citizens ol the State pe titioned for it, he could not stand in their way. The secession feeling largely pre dominates. From New York. JW York, Dxs. 3.

From the National (Qa.) American. Met Ulitort In all probability a Con vention' ot the people of Georgia will meet at an early day, to determino what is the best policy for the State to adopt in the present alarming crisis. It is necessary that Georgia should take bold and decisivo action, but it should be characterized by great wisdom and pru dence; for her course will control that of the "Cotton Stales" generally, and tell upon the happiness of her citizens to the latest posterity. The approaching Con vention will be the most important ono she ever held. Let the delegates be the oldesSvisest and best men of each coun ty, selected irrespective of party. Let boys and politicians stay at homo until they are needed in the field. "Old men for counsel, and ycung men for war." Party leaders nnd their subordinates have brought ruin upon the country, and for God's sake let them stand osido and let the People try to save it. They will do right if let alone. They know their rights and tlieir wrongs, and best how to redress them. Extremists and demagogues are inflaming the publio mind, and advising Hsh, unconstitutional action. Such men may have great ability, but they have not enough wisdom and conservatism to lead Win such times as these. In their inordi a najo ambition to savo their country, or, as tho case uouutu.-aa is H them, to immortalize themselves, they should not plunge us Into the abysmal depths of anarchy. Our condition is bud enough now; it can be made much worse. " Foeilis decensut Averni." It is an easy matter now to precipitate a bloody, exterminating war; but to restore peaca and prosperity will bo more difficult. "Hoe opus, hie latmr est." For ono time, lot the People choose their delegates without the trickery of politicians. Let there bo 110 contest, but let the respon sible work bo done coolly and calmly.
