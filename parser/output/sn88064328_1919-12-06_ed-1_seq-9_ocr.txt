TRADE WITH GERMANY. During the great war trade with Germany was illegal, punishable with fine and imprisonment. Many persons accused of it, es pecially Great Britain, were convicted of "trading with th.; enemy" and properly punished. A disposition has been shown by some to maintain this hostile at titude toward Germany even nfter the war wan over, because of the barbarities inflicted by the Or mans during the struggle, and the wanton destruction of property of the Allies on 1he high seas, in raids and 'bombing conspiracies. A strong element also insisted on keeping out («erman goods as n protection to American fond Brit ish factories and establishments, and laws were proposed and passed to that end. The matt'-r of dyes and drugs received t h-* greatest consideration. Germany had secured a monopoly in these goods, and it cost, the United States —and Great Britain as w-'ll — a long -fight, much effort and some expenditure of money to build up home industries in these lines of goods. The movement was a success in America, and the dye industry in particular was placed on a substantial and pay ing basis. A fear has been enter tained that after the war closed Germany would enter the field again and seek to rccovcr its old monopoly and crush out our in fant industry. Protection against these efforts on its part was called far and granted. It was also suggested that Ger many might "dump" on this and other Allied countries quantities of cheap and poorly made goods produced by underpaid labor, and thus cripple our industries. Laws aiming to assure the protection of these industries against "dump ing" were passed in Great Btitain an dthe United States. But as time passed and with it. some of the bitterness of the war, the folly of shutting off all Ger man trade was recognized by all persons who gave thcsubjcct care ful consideration. It was not 10 the interest of the world to crush Germany commercially and eco nomically; and distinctly against the interest of the Allies, for it wjould rend*** it."impossible to pay the heavy damages and indemni ties of the country. Tt was feit also that Germany would be a good country toNfleal with, as it •was short in nearly everv line of poods. Nearly all the countries that had recently beep at war wit h Germanv began to bid for its trade. The contest has grow>i stronger the further we have trot ten awav f r om the war and there is now active competition, espec ially between Great Britain and the United States, for German '?'* "t '*• i , t .mi*. ** > eoJtf mnrjwhmrm im moimmHBm ito—fd pedkegee of *0 oigareMee; «r S p*ofi»ooo fus »oner mi 1 * anrioa.

The biggest boom in this line was in October, when all coun tries began to appreciate the fact that German Irade was well worth while, and that there wns no reason whv it should l*e re jected. Before the war Germany stood second in trade with the United States aVid with Great Bri tain. These two countries en joyed the greatest reciprocal trade in their interchange of goods, and their next heaviest commerce was with Germany, with Great Britain slightly in the lead. Our October exports to Germany was more than half that of last year and over 50 per cent of our exports to South America. An active competition has started between the two coun tries for German business. The United States is seeking to re cover the business it. lost with the war and is in a fair wav of doing so.

HELPFUL IDEA FROM DEN VER. BY WAY OF LOB ANGELES. Kver since 1 was in Denver three years sine« I've been wanting to tell you New Iberia folks how they manage dangerous railroad crossings in that city. Of course all are dangerous if you are deaf and Mind, hut some crossings nr.' all are dangerous, if you are deaf and here 1 refer to those that make h sudden curve such as ex ists at <he corner of Center ami Washington Street. In Denver they had no man with flag and needed none at any of the cross ings, although there are many more people using these thorough fares than in New Iberia. Where there was no bend or curve they simply had a sign up which bad railroad crossing, but at each one of these bends or curves they had rected a* standard some four or five feet high On either side of which was a sign printed in large letters, "Danger", a diagram of which T enclose with this letter. These danger signals ^cre all painted red. while the letters of the word danger were white, s.» you could read them a long ways o<T. The letters may have been black, I'm not so certain now, but 1 distinctly remember that the post and boards on either side were a bright red, (the boards on which were printed the word danger,.» and they were kept a bright red all the while, not allowed to grow dingy or fade out. Accidents there are much less frequent than in New Iberia, for I talked with some business people who kept a grocery within a few feet of one of these sudden curves, and they told me they had been there three years, and no accident had hap pened there since thewe most ef fective signs had been used. Den ver is one of the most progressive cities in the Union and is, in many ways better run than Los Angeles.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Wilson's message to Congress is a sound state docu ment, but it lacks the "high lights" which have distinguished some of his preceding messages. One outstanding feature is its omission of anything more thaa indirect reference to the peace treaty. While his evident deci sion not to reopen the treaty fight at once may disappoint many of his oyrn and the treaty's support ers, who feel that the peace ques tion should lake precedence over all others because its settlement must precede both the national and the international adjustment, it was dictated, aa we think, by gound reasoning and good general ship. Time ia now fighting on the side of the treaty. The pressure of nublic opinion is being felt at Washington. Senators, unblinded by passion, or prejudice, or rabid partisanship, are singlv and col lectively seeking out the way to an acceptable compromise. Mr. Wilson apparently feels that they should l^e given time and oppor tunity for that search unham pered by an immediate reopening of the promiscuous set-to on tbe Senate floor. The matter of railroad legisla tion if» specifically reserved for discussion in a later message. Next in interest is the domestic situation, with its manifold trotr bies and problema. With respect to industrial strife and unrest, the president delivers a homily fair enough and instructive enough, but rather disappointing in that it prescribe« no ready-made cures. Hi« conclusion« «re virtually summed np in this single sentence . "The real antidote for the tmr<^ which manifest« itself is not sup pression, but a deep consideration of the wrongs that be.set our national life and the application of a remedy." Mut he speaks out surely and forcibly against tiie foiiienlers of anarchy and the rev olutionary agitators. "In Amer ica," he declares, "there is but one way by whieh great reforms can be accomplished and the re lief sought 11v classes obtained, and that is through the orderly processes of representative gov ernment." Those who would pro pose any other method are eii '-j mies of this country." And hc| asl<s for laws to strengthen the government in its fiirht upon these enemies. With respect to the problem <>T excessive living cost, Mr. Wilson offers several definite sugges tions. Tie recommends again the extension of the food control act to cover the living cost emerg ency. He urges the enactment of regulations "with regard to all goods destined f () r interstate shipments," to strike down "t*ie abuses which have grown up in the manipulation of prices by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life." He urges, for example, a requirement that goods destined for interstate j TH E ttlU«ERS AiXA ■ \ The Ford Motor Company have instructed us to sell the genuine Ford Parts to any and every reliable Garage who will pledge their use in the repaid of Ford Parts are absolutely necessary to the owner of Ford cars that he may fet full service from his car.
