In some of the comment on the Haitian episodic the action of Germany is held up as worthy of American imitation. Every government, it is urged, should be prompt and encrge^c in looking after the welfare of its citizens when appealed to from any quarter of the globe where they may hap pen to be. That policy, it is asserted, ad hered to from an early day, is at the bot tom of En*land's prestige among the pow ers. Germany is copying England, and the United States should copy Germany. The proposition itself is eminently sound. It affords no grounds for dispute. But it cannot !>e said that the English record which is founded on it is praiseworthy without exception. England's sensitiveness on the subject of abuse of her citizens is much more easily aroused by a iittle than by a great power. She does not bristle with indignation every time one of her citizens gets into trouble in a foreign country. It depends very much upon the particular country. And so it is proving to be with Germany. Her course in such matters seems to be regulated by the con dition of the country where the complaint is made. Helpless China is brought to book with a vengeance, and little Haiti is pushed up against the wall and forced to apologize and pay smart money in a jiffy. But Joes anybody believe that il two German missionaries had been mur dered by wil l tribes in Russia Germany would have moved as she has done in the case oi China, or that the arrest of a German citizen in England would have caused the appearance of German war ships in the Thames? The United States cannot afford to copy4 a bad example. She cannot afford to adopt one policy for the weak and another for the strong. She should not appear in blustering mood in any part of the world. Her citizens are entitled to her interest and protection everywhere, and that may be accorded them without undue haste or violent assumptions thai they can never in any circumstances be in the wrong. American citizenship should stand abroad fcr the best behavior; for the observance of the laws applying wherever the citi zen may be. When the citizen has met that requirement and then has abuses to complain or he need not fear that his case will not be championed by his home government. But the United States could not commit a greater mistake than by eml^rking on a policy of bullying small or defenseless pov%*ers. Mexican Kniliusia^m for >Ir, Bryan. The enthusiasm with which the Mexican people are greeting Mr. Bryan is well de served. Mexico is not only a silver produc ing country, but In actual practice con ducts its business on the basis of silver money, and Mr. Bryan just now is the most eminent champion of silver as a money metal in the world. He is well en titled therefore to the consideration that is being shown him by those whose interests j he so conspicuously represents. This en thusiasm. there is every reason to believe, will continue during Mr. Bryan's stay in the country. Wherever he may go the peo ple will desire to give expression to their appreciation of his services to the silver cause. But so far as Mr. Bryan is concerned, will his journey yield much more than personal gratification at a series of hearty personal greetings? Receptions and hurried visits here and there will fill up his time. Every thing will be on dress-parade arrange ments. and everybody in dress-parade hu mor, in his honor. He will see the country and the people In holiday attire, so to speak, and if he returns home with a com paratively rosy picture impressed upon his mind it will be no wonder. When he left the northwest after his stumping tour last year he was persuaded that the entire sec tion was aflame for him. The votes on election day went by large majorities to Mr. McKinley. Mr. Bryan had formed a stumper's hurried and misleading estimate of local sentiment. He is quite as likely now to form a stumper's hurried and mis leading estimate of conditions in Mexico. A stumper sees everything through a dis turbed medium. The fact is that Mr. Bryan is not likely to grow as a man of thought until after public interest in his personal presence has somewhat spent Itself. He has had no time for rest or reflection since his nomination for the Presidency eighteen months ago. His campaign for that office was in every Way so unusual that the liveliest interest in ihe man was everywhere excited. His fol lowers iH'came more attached to him in de feat than they had shown themselves to be when counting upon success, and he has been trotting about in response to their imitations pretty much ever since. How much longer this will continue is a ques tion. Mr. Bryan himself seems to enjoy the experience. But while it continues the conditions will not be favorable for either investigation of problems or assimilation of conclusions, and the country may expect cnly entertaining variations on the theme with which Mr. Bryan first attracted na tional attention. According to Mr. Bryan's financial the ory. its realization tnrough his election Is President would instantly double the value of the millions of Mexico's silver in th** markets of the world. Xo wonder Mexico is glad to see him and makes much of 11 im. There is a threatening possibility that Mr. Bt>an may capture the silver-pro ducing vote of Mexico. Six-Hay Bicycle Races. New York has just passed through aroth?r six-day bicycle race, has exper ier.ced agonies of sympathy for the suffer ers on the track and has hailed the winner of the test of endurance with loud plaudits. Now follows the inevitable outcry against the brutality of these exhibitions. There seems to be a particularly bitter feeling among the people in the immediate vicinity because of the large numixr of men who w*re forced out of the race by the lively pace, and l>ecause, too. of the extraordi nary performance of the leaders. These races are disgraceful and should be pro hibited by law. They serve no useful pur pose and accomplish many harmful results. It is significant that the League of Ameri can Wheelmen, the central organization of j bicyclists in this country, is said to be con templating action that u:ll prevent such ] tcntests in the future, save without the sanction of the league, which means a practical black-list Irg of every participant. I This step should be taken in the interest of wheeling as a sport and a recreation. Six-day matches of all kinds have been in vrgue for many years. That period, from Sunday to Sunday, has been chosen doubt less because of its avoidance upon the day generally recognized as a day of rest. Were It not for the intervention of Sunday, and j the danger that the element In the popula tion that demands a measure of respect for the day might enter a successful protest. It Is safe to assume that In time the walking matches, running matches, eating, fasting, bicycling contests, or what not, would ere new have been extended Into fortnight af fairs. and Indeed there is no probable limit to be placed upon the cupidity of-the mana gers and the folly of the victims and the patrons. In the case of the latter-day bi cycling contests, the racers are sustained during the long stretches of their extraordi nary efTorts 4?y drugs. Cocaine, with its wonderfully stimulating effect upon the nerves and Its ultimately poisonous efTect upon the muscles, is administered in large Quantities and serves to keep the men at work at a tremendous cost. If the matter only affected the participants the public would have little concern, for the men go into these competitions well aware of their tremendous requirements. But the moral effect upon the people Is not safely to be estimated. The argument of public demor alization logically urged against prize-fight ing. buil-flghting, chicken-fighting, rat-kill ing. bear-baiting and other so-called "en tertainmerts" for the delectation of the public applies equally to a spectacle In which human beings are tortured or are permitted to torture themselves for a pal try money prize. The entertainment af forded by such a contest as that which has just closed is meager save to those who crave the sight of human suffering or en durance. The element of racing is absent for the casual spectator. The Interest Is maintained only by virtue of the fact that some one of the contestants may at any time succumb to his sufferings, or may be disabled by an accident. The whole affair is a huge money-maker for the benefit of a very few men. and the public pays the price simply because It is thought to be smart and up-to-date to patronize these disgraceful spectacles. New York, how ever, deserves little sympathy in her pres ent spasm of virtue, for she neglected the opportunity last year to put an end to the six-day races. Nevertheless, It Is to be hoped that the present effort to suppress such races will succeed. m ? m Xatlonail lloartl of Trade. The National Hoard of Trade, which meets today In this city for its annual ses sion, receives its customary hearty wel come from the citizens of Washington. The board's excellent habit of coming to the capital city for its deliberations has done much to bring ether national organizations to Washington for annual meeting pur poses, and there are now several that never consider the possibility of assembling else where. There are good reasons for this course. The presence here of Congress In session is a material attraction for such a body as the National Board of Trade, which is formed to consider topics bearing upon items of national legislation, and whatever Influence it brings to bear upon a question of public consequence must be exerted mainly through the two legislative houses. This body has a long and honor able record. It is composed of representa tives of trade organizations and commer cial associations in every section of the country, anil includes in its membership the Washington Board of Trade. It is an agency for active endeavor in behalf of projects of national importance, a factor of high potentiality for commercial de velopment. >? VlolntioiiM nf the Organic Act. All propositions, of whatever nature, that tend to infringe upon the basic principle of the law of 187s establishing the relations between the District of Columbia and the geifc ral government, are to be discouraged and disapproved. The "organic act" must be maintained in its entirety, and the Dis trict cannot afford at any time to yield in the least in its insistence upon a full en forcement of the statute In spirit and let ter. There may be temptaliuns now and then, when Congress halts before making needful appropriations on the customary half-and-half basis, for District officials and citizens to urge that in order to secure the objects in view the District assume all the burden, notwithstanding the equities that demand an equal division of the ex pense. But not even the most vital necessi ties should operate to the approval of these suggestions by the Commissioners. There is danger in yielding on little things. Keep the law of 1S7H constantly In mind In every department of the local government, whether the police pension fund or any other appropriation is in question. Cats In the Appropriation!!. The legislative appropriation bill, as first framed and laid before the House, con tains 0 material cut from the estimates submitted, amounting to about $7<*i,u?JO, and at the same time makes a reduction of from the amounts appropriated for the current fiscal year. Thus is indi cated a policy of close calculation that is intended to enable- the treasury to feel bottom once more.' It ia now to be ex pected that similar cuts will he made in al! the bills that are amenable to this process. The President sounded a note of wtrnlng against extravagance in his mes sage and the leaders of the republican side cf the House have since joined with him in an effort to restore the balance on the treasury books to the right side of Che account. The hope is that no material in terest will suffer m this reduction of ex penses. It i3 fortunate that the cheering prospects of a prosperous year, both for the country and the government, do not tempt the framers of the budgets in the lower house to flights of extravagance. The manner in which New Yorkers be come virtuously indignant concerning the six-day bicycle race after it is all over cannot fail to remind many people of the sentiment created t<y the recent election In that city. One of the mcst uncomfortable things that could happen to General Weyier would be to find himself in a. position to personally conduct the active antagonism to the United States which he recommends. ? I ? ? The attention which some of our poli ticians devote to docks is calculated to give the American eagle an occasional much needed rest. ? ? There- is very little discouragement in the fact that the most vigorous objections to the President's message come from abroad. It is a scant but Just compliment to say i that ex-<iueen Lllluokalanl's poetry is bet ter than her politics. ? ? ? A Rraaonaklr Delay. Correspondent Pepper, in his latest letter to The Star from Havana, seeks an answer to the question that was propounded in these columns last week, as to how long a trial should be given to tne reform Program of the Spanish government in Cuba. Mr. Pepper seeks the solution by Interviewing representatives of the various classes who new combine to create what might be termed the "situation" In the Island. He shows that the planters and merchants of Havana province have agreed generally that the United States will not wait longer than next May before taking active steps toward Intervention. The rainy season wlli come In May. and that month will probably witness the close of the campaign in the field. By that time, also, the auton omy scheme will have demonstrated Its failure, according to these people, who have little faith In the reform program. On the other hand, the official class, the Spaniards now attempting to uphold the propositions that come from Madrid, com placently believe, or profess to believe, that this country will do nothing for another year, arguing that the same chain of cir cumstances that enabled 8paln to prevent Intervention last year will operate now to keep the President and Congress from pre cipitating a crisis. The ulta-Spaniah resi dents of the capital refuse to believe that the time for Intervention will ever come, yet they denounce the United States bit terly, and declare their readiness to go to war, if need be, to protect the rights of Spain. This attitude indicates their fear that the day of international judgment Is relatively near. The Insurgents themselves and their ardent sympathizers seem to have agreed upon February as the time when action will be taken by this government In default of genuine performances by Spain in the line of reform. The American resi dents hold diverse view?. From all these estimates it is to be seen that Cuba and even Spain looks for some action in the way of intervention to stop the war. It Is significant that there is little mention of late of such action taking the form of a recognition of tne belligerency of the insur gents. The Cubans look forward confi dently to an actual recognition of their in dependence. In the light of this letter It is apparent that while the "reasonable time" of trial may be an indefinite ttrm, and while the day of intervention may still be a movable feast In the international calendar, yet there are signs that this day cannot forever be postponed and that even the Spaniards look forward to the time when, the patience of the United States having been utterly exhausted, this govern ment will take decisive action looking to the settlement of the strife. Mr. Grosvenor, in drawing civil service distinctions, shows that his statesmanship Is as finely adjustable as his mathematics. Richard Croker seems disposed to remind David B. Hill forcibly of the old motto, "to the victors belong the spoils." In viewing Germany's performance, Spain's great regret is that President Sam is not Cncle Sam. Some of the news which comes from Cuba appears to be not only "boiled down" but sweetened. ?? ?
