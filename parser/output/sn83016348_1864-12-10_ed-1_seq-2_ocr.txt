The Annual Message of President transmitted to Congress on Tuesday last, opens by expressing the profoundest gratitude to Heaven for the blessings of health and our abun dant harvests. The President says “ the condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory.’’ Our political relations with Mexico have undergone no change, and this country lias strictly main tained a neutrality between the belligerents. The difficulties which caused the closing of the inner oceanic transit route across the Isth mus, have been amicably adjusted, and that great commercial and political improvement will soon be re-opened. Telegraphic communication with Great Brit ain, it is expected, will soon be renewed, and tin proposed telegraphic, communication with Europe byway of Behring’s Straits, is also in prospect of accomplishment. The relations of this country with Japan, China, Egypt, the Barhary Powers, the Stales of Central America, and the Kepublics of South America, are generally of the most friendly character. The President desires authority of Congress to furnish a gunboat to the Liberian Republic to aid in arresting tho slave trade. The President refers to the opening of the ports of Norfolk, Fernandiuo and Pensacola, and hopes are expressed that foreign merchants will consider it safer to resort to those open ports than to pursue a contraband trade. He recommends that foreign slave-traders be pre vented from acquiring domicil, Ac., in this country. He says that “if it were a new and open question, the maratime powers would not concede the principle of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United Stales.” He refers to the unforeseen difficulties which have arisen in Brazilian and Brtisli ports, and on the north ern boundaries of the United States. The net of the. last session for the encourage ment of emigration has been nut in partial operation, hut an amendment of the act is neces sary to prevent fraud, .Ve. He recommends the encouragement of emigration as must important to this government. The President states that the financial affairs of the government have been successfully ad ministered. The receipts from all sources dur ing the year, including loans and balances in ibe treasury July Ist, l<*d>3. were $1,394,79(5,- (•b7.(2, and the aggregate disbursements upon ilic same basis were tfl 298,05(5,101.89 —leaving a balance in the treasury of $9(3,739,905.73. — The public debt on tho Ist of July hist was 5351,740,01)0.489.41); and should the war continue for another year, the debt may be increased by about live hundred millions. The President says, “As the debt is held for the most part by our own people, it has become a substantial branch of national, through private, property and certain suggestions are made to Congress in connection with its general distribution among the people. The National Banking system, lie says, is proving lo he greatly acceptable to capitalist* and the people; and he hopes that very soon there will be in the United Stales no hanks ot issue nor. authorized by Congress, and no bank note circulation not secured by the government. Five hundred and twenty-four National banks have already been organized. The reports of the {Secretaries of War and Navy are referred to for details of military oper ations. Tho President says “he concurs with ihe Secretary of the Treasury in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war, derived from taxation, shall be still limber increased.” * The number of naval captures, since hostili ties commenced, is 1,117'.) —of which 2(57 are steamers. The proceeds of condemned prize property thus far reported is $14,39(3,250.51. The postal revenue for the year ending June 30, 1 H4>4, amount to $12,438,258.78, and the expenditures to $!2,(344,78(5.20-- , the excess of expenditures over receipts being $20(5,(552.42. The report of the Secretary of tin* Interior, in relation lo Indian affairs, the Pacific railroad, mineral discoveries, aVc., is commended to the attention of Congress. There have been 4,221,342 acres of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending 30th of September hist, of which J ,538,(314 acres were entered under the homestead law. The cash received was $51,011),44(3. There is now open to settlement about 133,000,000 acres of surveyed land. The President refers to the importance of re modeling our Indian system. Also, to the re markable feature in the military operations of the year—being the attempted march of Gen. Sherman through 300 miles of the insurgent region. Also to the fact that 12,000 citizens in each of the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal governments with a free Constitution. The present number of army invalid pension ers is 22.7(37, and of navy invalids, 712. Of widows, orphans and mothers, 22, 1 OS have been placed on the army pension rolls, and 248 on the navy rolls. Tlie Message concludes as follows: 

RESULTS OF THE WAR, The war continues. Since the last annual message, all the important lines and posi tions then occupied by our forces have been maintained and our arms have been steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions left in the rear; so that Missouri. Kentucky, Ten nessee, and parts of other States, have again produced reasonably fair crops. The most remarkable feature-in the mili tary operations of tlie year is General Sher man's‘attempted march of three hundred miles directly through the insurgent region, it tends to show a great increase of our rel ative strength, that our General-in-Chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the enemy and yet detach a well appointed large army to move on such an expedition. The result not yet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged. Important movements have also occurred during tho year to the effect of moulding so ciety for the durability of the Union. Al though short of complete success, it is much in the right direction that twelve thousand citizens in each of the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized local State Governments with free Constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to maintain and ad minister them. The movements in the same direction, more extensive though less defi nite, in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee, should not be overlooked; but Maryland presents the example of complete success. Maryland is secure to liberty and Union for sill the lutury*. The genius of Rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul spirit, being driven out it may seek to tear Ler, but it will woo her no more. At the last cession of Congrbsa a proposed to the Constitution, abolishing slavery throughout the United States, passed the Senate, but failed for want of the requi site two thirds vote in the House of Repre sentatives. Although the present is the same Congress and nearly the same mem bers, and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the reconsideration any! passage of the measure at the present session. Of course, the abstract question is not changed,* but an intervening election shows almost certainly that the next Con gress w ill pass the measure if this dues not. Hence, there is only a question of lime as to when the proposed amendment will go to • the States for their action, and. as it is to go 1 at all events, may* we not agree that the! sooner the better ? It is not claimed that I the election has imposed a duty on niemlifc's to change their views or their votes any I further limn as an additional element to be i considered, their judgment may be affected | by it. It is tlie voice of the people, now for : the first time heard, upon the question. In ( a great national crisis like ours unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very desirable, almost indispensable, and yet no appearance to such unanimity is at tainable unless some deference shall he paid to the will of the majority, simply because it is the will of* the majority. THE 

PUBLIC* spirit. In this ease, the common end is the mum* tcnaucc of the I nion, and among the means to secure that end, such will, through the election, is most clearly declared in favor of such a constitutional amendment. The most reliable indication ot public purpose iu this country is derived through our popular elec tions. Judging by the recent canvass, and its results, the purpose of the people, within the byal Stales, to maintain the integrity of the Union w r as never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than now. Tho extraor dinary calmness and good order with which the millions of voters mingled at the polls gave strong assuaranee of this. Not only all those who supported the Union ticket, so called, but a great majority of the oppos ing party also may be fairly claimed to en tertain and to be actuated by the same pur pose. It is an unanswerable argument to • his effect, that no candidate for any office, however high or low. has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the Union. There has been milch impugning of mo tives, and much heated controversy, as to the proper means and best mode oUat! vann ing the Union cause: hut on the distinct issue of Union or no Union, the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people. In affording to the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another, and to the world, this firmness and unanimity of purpose, the election has been of vast value to the national cause. NATIONAL RESOURCES. Ihe election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be known—the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of national resources—t' at of living men. While it is melancholy to reflect'Unit the War has filled so many graves and carried mourning to so many hearts, it is some relief to know that, compared with the surviving, the fallen have been so few.— While corps, and divisions, and brigades, ami regiments have formed, and fought, and dwindled, and gone out of existence, a great .majority ot tlie men who composed them are still living. The same is true of the naval service. The election returns prove this. — So many voters could not else be found.- The States regularly holding elections, both now and four years ago, to wit; California. Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois. Indiana. lowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massa chusetts, Michigan, Minncssota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia,' and Wisconsin, cast 3,1)82,011 votes now, against 3,870,222 cast then, showing im aggregate now of 3,082,011. To this is to be added 33,7(32 cast now in the new Statesthat did not vote in 18(30, thus swelling the aggregate to 4,013,773, and the net increase during the three years and a half of war to 145,551. — A table is appended showing particulars. — To this again should be added tho number of soldiers in tho field from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Indi ana, Illinois, and California, who, by the laws of those States, could not vote away from their homes, and which number cannot be less than 00,000. Nor yet is this all. — The number in the organized Teritories is a trifle now to what it was four years ago, while thousands, white and black, join ns as the national arms press back tlie insurgent lines. So much is shown affirmatively and nega tively by the election. It iv not material to inquire how the increase has been produced, or to show that it would ha*.v been greater but for the war, which is probably true. — I he important fact remains demonstrated that we have more men no v than we had when the war began, that we* are not ex hausted, nor in the process c.*f exhaustion, that we are gaining strength, and may, if need be, maintain the contest indefinitely.— Phis, as to men. Material rsources are mow more complete and abinida it than ever. THE MAINTENANCE OFTHK UNION -CONDITIONS OK PEACE. The natural resources then are n’liexhaust ed. and, as we believe, inexhaustible. The public purpose to establish and ma.'ntuin the national authority is unchanged, and, a * we believe, unchangeable. The manne rof con tinuing the effort remains to choc v. On careful consideration of all the evidt nee ac cessible, it seems to me that no atte upt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good. He would accept l ath ing short of severance of the Union, pre cisely what we will not and cannot gl ve.— His declarations to this effect are ex elicit and oft-repeated. He does not attorn o! to deceive us. He affords us no excuse to de ceive ourselves. He cannot voluntarily* re* accept tin* Union. We cannot voluntarily yield it. Between him and us the issm iis distinct, simple, and inflexible. It is an issue which can only bo tried by war and tie* eidod victory. If we yield we are beaten.- If the Southern people fail him he is beaten W Either way it would he the victory and de feat following war. What is true, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause, is not necessarily true of those who follow.— Although he cannot re-accept the Union, they can. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and re-union. The number (if such may increase. They can at any mo ment have peace, simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority under the Constitution. After so much the Government could not, if it would, maintain war against them. The loyal peo ple would not sustain or allow it. If ques tions should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation, con ferences, courts, and votes operating only in constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain and other possible questions are and would be beyond the Executive power to adjust, as, for instance, the admission of members into Congress, and whatever might require the appropriation of •money. 'lne Executive power itself would he greatly di minished by the cessation of actual war.— Pardons and remissions of forfeitures, how ever, would still he within the Executive control. In what spirit and temper this con trol would bo exercised can be fairly judged of by the past. A year ago a general par don and amnesty, upon specified terms, were offered to all except certain designated class es, and it was at tlie same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency. During the year many availed themselves o'fv.tbe general provision, and many more wouhL only that the signs of had faith in some IccT lo such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain. During the same time, also, special pardons have been granted to individuals of the ex cepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied. Thus, practically, the door has been for a full year open to all, ex cept such as were uot in condition to make free choice —that is, such as were in custody or under constraint. It is still so open to all. But the time may come when public duty shall demand that it bo closed, and that in lieu more vigorous measures than hereto fore shall he adopted. In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispen sable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government. I retract nothing heretofore said us to slavery. I repeat the declaration made a year- ago, that while I remain in my present position I shall not at tempt to retract or-modify the Emancipation Proclamation, nnr .-hull I return to slavery any person who is tree hy the terms of that proelumuticn or hy any of the acts of Con- Jtt'css.. 11 flic p#>jile should, hy whatever n.ode or menus, make it an executive duty to re-enslnve stndt persons, another,- and not* | L must la- their instrument to perform it.— In stating a single condition of peace, I mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall have ceased on the part of tiiose who began.

The motive for this p iecc of scoundrelism is supposed to be a w.'iolesome dread on the part of that party, tin it their children, if taught the rudiments of a common English education, will desert live negro faith of their fathers, and really com 0 to the belief that the while race re quin £ some care and the benefits of legis latioi ' ns well as the colored, who have mo nopo! iz.ed all the anxious solicitude of that party for years.
