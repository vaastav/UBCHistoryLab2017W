The World Washii STRENGTHJN RAILS Coal Roads Show Especially Well in Day's Trading. STEEL REPORT IS MIXED New Low Record of Unfilled Tonnage for Month of November. , WORSE EXPECTED BY STREET I ' General Conditions of Industry Bet. j ter Than Trade Beports Had Led to Believe. I NEW" YORK, December 10.?The stock market was inclined to heaviness at the opening today, but soon made recovery Rnd before the end of the first hour many of the active issues were selling at advances well above yesterday's close. The decision in the anthracite coal case was probably the most potent factor, although the weekly trade reviews were j rather favorable. Coal Boads Lead Uplift. R< ading and Lehigh Valley were most prominent in the upward movement, with tnarked strength in Union Pacific, St. Paul, United States Steel and American Smelting. The local tractions were lower, however. on the counter proposition of McAdoo interests for construction and operation of the proposed subways. Business during the brief session embraced a number of specialties, some of which registerMi material gains. Steel Corporation's Be port. w The noteworthy feature of the day- in* eluded the monthly report of the United States Steel Corporation's unfilled tonnage for November, which established a new low record with 11,700,413 tons, a falling off of 111.530 tons from the previous record established in the preceding month. On the whole the showing was better than trade conditions had ;ed many to expect. i The bank statement was more favorable in its actual condition than the week's novements indicated. As an offset to the "average" loan increase of over J3.000.uu0 '.he "actual" statement showed a loan - ontractlon of over $!4.0u0,0.X>. while the . asn under tins same head was less by half than most of the previous days' estimates.

Instead of that tigure. however. Saturday's statement showed a loss of only ?3,865,000 in specie and leg&is. and as there was a contraction of $14,248 20ft in loans, and a corresponding shrinkage of $18,116,600 In deposits, the result was that reserve requirements were lowered by a sunt in excess of the loss of cash, so that the total reserve actually rose $663,325. bringing the present surplus to $5,711,825 ibove the 25 per cent minimum. Just svliy the decrease in cash was so much ess than expected is difficult of explana:ion, as the statement of the trust eomlanies and outside institutions showed jut very slight changes in their cash, loldings. It is probable that some of the loans of lie banks have been shifted to the trust ;ompanies, since these institutions report i gain in that item during the week of 15,766,700. *It is also probable that interlational operations figured in the week's msiness. The statement, based on averiges, differed widely from the stattment if actual conditions', the-changes aceordng to average** having been an Increase if $5,000,000 in loans, a decrease of $9,33,333 in sp'cie- and legal tenders, a decrease of $4,500,000 in deposits, and a reuction in reserve of $8,250,000, .making he surplus only $3,658,825. The actual tatement, however, is a truer exhibit of ouditions of banks than the compilation f averages. Kxchange quotations show hat gold might be imported now at a ery small profit. 

FOREIGN MARKETS. IAINDON", December 10.?The stock larket was quiet and governed principally iy politics during the week. The tenancy of prices was downward. Operators flio had bought and marked up values in uticipation of big unionist victories gradally reduced their commitments, depresslg consols as much as a point, but the ettei* monetary outlook and lower disount rates checked the fall and made tie close In the British section well above lie lowest. Consols, however, lost threeuarters of a point on the week. Foreign ecur'.ties yielding good returns continued 4 attract attention, -but mining shares lowly weakened in the absence of suport and the approach of the settlement. American securities started the week iwer on bear pressure and poor steel trade eports. but President Taft's message was ?ee?ve<i favorably and with rumors of gold nports at New York the market recovred and closed practically unchanged, he money market was plentifuly supred with funds, but the discount rates ardened on rumors of an American gold emaud and the fact that Turkey and lei-many both want the metal. Money was easily obtainable today. , >iscount rates wore firm on fears of forign go'd demands. The approaelr of the settlement checkd business on the stock exchange, and lie market finished the week dull. Brlt?h securities declined on further dls- 1 ppointing election results, but Mexican , ails and trunk line shares hardened. i American securities opened fraction ( igher. but eased later, and closed quiet , lth prices ranging from unchanged fo , , lower than yesterday's New York . losing.

IN CHECK Market Manipulators Forced to Take a Back Seat. BANKS DIDN'T LIKE GAME Public Confidence Undermined by Syndicate's Methods. NOT SO BAD, AFTER ALL *Iron and Steel Men Able to Find Bay of Sunshine in Situation. Talking Politics. By W. G. Nicholas. Special Correspondence of The Star. X*RW YORK', neeemlipr 1o 191f>. The market lias been comparatively free from pestiferous manipulation this week. That is because the pestiferous manipulators have been set back and kept in a state of subjection. They were taught that it was not good form to advertise their plays too openly, and that brass band and string instruments did not make music pleasant to the public ear or alluring to investors. It now appears that the much exploited speculative syndicate, which had voluntarily come to the assistance of the Morgan party was not a real sure-enough hard and fast syndicate, but a group of successful plungers held together by a sort of gentlemen's agreement, leadership in the movement being given to an operator who had been exceptionally successful during a series of campaigns extending through three or four years. That kind of a record was supposed to have made him a leader. The experience of the past month has disillusioned this plunger and his friends, and has shown them that something besides that is necessary for leadership of the kind that inspires c onfidence and a large public following. This fact having been impressed up-on the small and ambitious membership In the gentlemen's syndicate by bankers of great power, the campaign so noisily began collapsed, leaving the street full of mixed emotions of sorrow over losses sustained on Imprudent purchases and of joy over the suppression of a bunch of plunging gamblers, whose performances had driven away the public, cut the commission business down to nothing and brought the stock exchange into worse remitc than ir wns hefore. A Week of Politic* The President's message and discussion over the prospects of political legislation have engrossed a large share of the attention of Wall street thi>3 week. At the start off the message had a had market effect- It is true that the main features of the document had been common property in the street for twenty-four hours before its submission to Congress, but something more than a knowledge of the striking passages was required before there could be a satisfactory analysis. Simmered down, the message does not give a whole lot of enjoyment to the , large and anxious element whose prayer is to be let alone. The President assures those whom it may concern that no new legislation on business subjects need he looked for within a year. That is because the next Congress will not convene until a year from now. His assurance, therefore, amounts to little more than a pledge of exemption front doing anything for a year that cannot be done. Meantime the existing laws will be "vigorously enforced" and tested out. There is nothing in this to fill Wall street with exuberant joy. There te In this section no wild clamor for the enforcement of anti-corporation and anti-trust laws either in c whole or in part. t Come to think of it. Wall street discov- i ered tiiat it is not as anxious for a year's c respite as it is for an early settlement of e important pending questions. It therefore heard with satisfaction that i there is a possibility of the tobacco o trust and Standard Oil cases being ar- I gued before the Supreme Court early in t January instead of the middle of Febru- t ary, as programmed. There is nothing p official in this announcement, but it is t generally believtd, as the report came t from Washington sources usually reli- a able. The street has been taking consid- v eraole interest in the question of ap- b polntroents of new judges on the supreme a bench, and listens eagerly to all the gos- 1 sip coming from the capital on that sub- 11 ject- So far as can be ascertained, tlie c street has had no candidates, though of v course the background log rolling would 8 be kept a deadly secret. The public would e be the last to hear anything about it. t b Not Quite So Cocksure. c Those who have known all along how ^ the interstate commerce commission was a going to decide those freight rate ques c tious are not quite so cocksure now as iliey were. The railroads who let it be known that they had presented a case so very strong that it must perforce favorably influence the commission to dccidc their way have apparently seen a new llghk. They arc obliged to admit a that the shippers have also made a strong v case and presented facts and arguments ti calculated to Impress mortal mind, par- a tieularly political mortal mind, with the 0 force of public opinion against showing railroads special favors. It will lie a groat and glorious thing for the stock P market when this rate question will be ! decided one way or the other. If the railroads should gain a'l or part of whatj,1 they are asking there will be no further;'^ excuse for not going ahead with itn- ' provements and replacements now held in , abeyance. On the other hand, if the ' railroads should be turned down, they s can adjust their affairs to fit conditions J1 and go ahead on a modified scale. They will remember that they have worried I1 along and earned dividends without the advance in rates and may conclude that c they can pull through without the reve- t, nue that would be derived from au in- c" creased tax on traffic. In any event the H< situation will be cleared of the element of doubt, and that will be a big thing from a business and stock market point of view. One of the incidents of the week has a been the taking over of a large speculafive account by interests that did not jarc to see a big. block of stocks thrown 1( on the market. Late Tuesday after- a noon and during Wednesday forenoon a line of between 400,000 and tiOO.tjOO shares tl was shifted In open market within the J?' limits of one point or lees, the principal stocks being Steel, Union Pacific, Readng and Amalgamated Copper. The stuff teas tossed out and taken over in blocks ' )f 5,000 to 10,000 shares and it came so sl fast as to fairly startle the exchange, rhcre is no certainty as to the;identity )f the party or parties who transferred heir holdings and got out, but the finger joints to one of two or three heavycvf-iglu operators. And alter all it doesn't make much difference, aa it was not a .ase of threatened insolvency, but merely a' i sudden and violent change of heart ' from rampant and impatient bullishness Jf :o a position of doubt and timidity. Simply Didn't Do It. Q Mr. Morgan's failure to mutualize the gt fiquitable Life Assurance Company as Q1 >er half promise made when the great st janker took over Thomas Fortune Ryan's b( ;ontrolling interest in that company cl :aused a mild thrill. Xo explanations fa ivere offered as to why he did not an- d< jounce a plan at the annual meeting. He rmply did not do so and let it go at Q' hat. Retention of financial control of ills great money collecting agency might * ?aslly be a matter of the very highest imjortance should there come an urgent teed for the use of the huge life insurance deposits. Mr. Harriman always found it very desirable to have control of .nsurance companies, trust companies and express companies wh'Ie conducting his k? mormons railroad and industrial com- a tulgns, and every other great captain of P< tnance and industry likes to have as big lo i bank roll handy as possible. The r? oulds were adepts in this field for many h< i ears, although latterly they have loat ir ground there at elsewhere. 01 Judge Gary's latest sunshine interview ti i

On thi3 iccasion a majority of steel experts were n accord with him in saying that a slight j mprovenient can be detected in the steel; utlook?not much, to be sure, but some, ledrock in that industry seems to have teen struck at last and what changes are i o be detected are in the way of im- j irovement. After a'l the iron and s*teel tusiness has not been in such a deplora le state as many have tried to make it ippear. Production has been of moderate oiume, but appears smaller than it is ecause of the large increase in capacity rranged for by the great steel companies, ^his capacity appears extravagant in the ight of present conditions and present onsumption, but it will be none too large iith a return of prosperity and things :oing at flood tide. The great complaint ven as recently as four years ago was hat construction everywhere was kept ack aitd made costly by Inability to seure tin'slied steel and iron. There will e no such congestion on the next big oom. Construction will be accelerated nd costly delays will no longer be inurred by reason thereof. Money G&ing to Interior. New York banks have been losing money or a week or more to the Interior, and liere lias been a noticeable hardening of iterest rates. Time money rates show slisht change and the belief still prcails in banking circles that after tho urn of the year there will be a superbundance of funds In New York and ther important liscal centers. The I'nited States court In Philadelhia iias certainly put up a nice job on ) ie Supremo Court In Washington. The >\vor court lias decided that the Temple J on Company tthe coal 1rust) is an il- ! gal corporation and must dissolve, in ! n> next breath it decides that the con- j titutent parts of this corporation hate j one nothing, so far as the evidence hows, to convince it of acts in re- I traint of trade. Both sides to the c<m oversy claim to have won out. As a tatter of fact, neither side has won out : Is a drawn battle and the Supreme ; ourt will have to be the umpire. The immediate majket efTect of the dc islon was to advance the stocks of tho ;veral anthracite coal roads. The stocks ould have advanced, no matter what the i pcision may have been. If it had been :raight out against the roads on all obits at issue there would have been melon to divide In the form of "rights'* 11 coal lands of enormous value. If the eelsion had been in favor of the ruil>ads, it would have s'gnitied official ctiuieacence in the schemes as now ganlzed. Either way would have been , > the benefit of the stocks of the comanies involved. As the matter now , .ands the Supreme Court will have j > determine which way the cat jumps, rid whichever way it may go stock- ( alders will benefit. There Is no pos- , bilitv of a confiscation or impairment , f the real equities. NEW

A e young American just returning from - a 1 three-year business trip to China, which ^ took him all over the empire, tells of a \ custom practiced by the Chinese which i might well bo used to advantage in this 1 young and inexperienced republic, where too little time or thought is given to the J finer points of etiquette. c "When a salesman or person seeking a 1 business Interview presents his card at ' the entrance to a Chinese merchant's place ' of business the possibility of an audience depends altogether upon how he deports j himself while awaiting the return of the , card bearer. Should ho be so indiscrct as to put one foot over a twelve inch railing that intervenes between the step und the doorway no manner of persuasion can r prevail upon the merchant, to grant him , an interview. !, In case he waits patiently in the space , allotted to unknown callers this fact is noted and he is usually ushered in. Once in there is still a more delicate f matter to be disposed of, and in case the * newcomer is ignorant of the custom he , fares ill with his errand. Immediately upon the caller's entering and taking a seat a servant brings a serving of tea, !" which includes a small cup for each per- , son preset.t. The point of etiquette denands that tics tea shall not be touched until the guest is ready to depart in case the interview has been a pleasant one. in ' which ease the caller is supposed to take -? jp and drink his tea at parting, and at c this signal ail the others do likewise. 'f However, should it so happen that the y. Chinaman is not pleijed with his caller ind is in any way annoyed by him the " nerchant takes up the tea and begins to Irink at once, which act is a direct and leclded hint that the interview is ended ?nd has not been to the pleasure of the nerchant. The caller is then expected to :ake his Immediate departure. < When a caller has become well ac- he juainted some of the formality is broken th >y the Ch nese. and on a cold day a cup he >f tea is served immediately to the guest li n a social way. But the "formal" tea ni s still to be observed and partaken of at vr larting, irrespective of the cup given to pr varm and greet the caller on bis arrival, a This, however, is done only after many oa ,'isits, when the business dealings have *h >een of such a nature as to warrant Pi !riendshlp and this hbspitallty. 2^ v ( All the Difference. th 'roui the Cleveland Leader. .u . ha "I understand that the smart set is ha snubbing the De Bucks because tlicy Ri have a skeleton in their closet." co "Not at all.
