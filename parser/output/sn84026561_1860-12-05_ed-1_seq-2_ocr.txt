Dr. Beck, of Dant- zix, has been making a curious discovery he has found the antidote, or rather the counter-poison for alcohol. It is a mineral paste, which he incloses within an olive, and which, once absorbed, destroys not only the effects, but also the consequences of drunk enness. A number of experiments have been made with very remarkable results. If any discovery should ever be made that will counteract the physical evils of intoxicat ing beverages, we fear it will greatly increase the curse of drunkenness in the world. The diseases and deaths that follow in the train T these are removed, the moral and social evils that attend it will be insufficient to restrain many that are held in check. Unhappy Married People. A cotemporary gives advice to "unhappy married people," a class tf beings who, we trust, form but a small minority of the community. But the experience of cur co temporary would seem to have been extensive. We quote it for the benefit of thoc whom it may concern : "It happens seldom that two human be ings are so exquisitely adapted to- one an other, oy nature anu euucation, mat iuty acquire the art of living happily togetLcr without both being compelled 10 iukke pain ful sacrifices of habit, taste and Ictiiug.

Generally, this spirit of mutual concession is not acquired immediately. The art of living together justly and joyously is one which is intrinsically uitticult, and upon which the appointed teachers of men throw little light. If a tenth part ct the genius and toil which have been wasted upon ques tions ot metaphysics, had been expended up on elucidating the laws relating to the hu man temper, we should, by this time, proba- . --"uwi - mi pui vanr una - utninite principles, the knowledge of which wonM greatly smooth the path that ' leads to mar ried happiness. As it is, we have all to solve the great problem unlisted, and to learn our expectations, and we may be sufferers. It i worth while to remember that the future is like the skies in April, sometimes cloudy, and sometimes clear and favorable ; and, as it would be folly to despair of again seeing the sun, because to-day is stormy, o it is unwise to sink into despondency when for- tunc iru us, since, in me common course, she may be surely expected to smile again. And again, dnrit be discouraged, if you are deceived in tho people of the world. They are very rotten in the core. From sources such as these, you may be most unexpectedly deceived, and you will naturally feel sore un der such deceptions ; but to these you must become used ; if you fare as most neonle do. they will lose their novelty before-you grow gray, and you will learn to trust men cautiously and examine their characters close: ly before you allow them great opportunities to injure you. , Don't be discouraged under any circum stances.

One error we find, is cherished by nearly ail uohai ' married people, namely : each thinks .'.. the fault is on the other side. The husoauu Ukes it for granted that all would be well with them it only his wife were a little diff erent from what she is, and the wife feels sure that perfect happiness would be the in stantaneouh result if only that husband of hers were not quite so unreasonable. In al most all cases this opinion is erroneous. There cannot be a quarrel unless both be in fault There can seldom be permanent es trangement without previous, uults on both sides. The Southern Tress. The Charleston Mercury, alluding to the telegraphic rumors that President Buchanan will oppose secession, sa) s: . We certainly deprecate war with the Northern people through the General Gov ernment ; but Mr. Buchanan may be assured that the first attempt, in any foim, to coerce South Carolina into subnotion to a Govern ment she has thrown off, will be considered war. He may call it by what name he pleases, but the sword will then be the final and only arbiter between us. All hopes (if he has any) of a readjufctmcnt of the relations between the two sections, of the Union under one government, will have ended, and ended forever. He is totally mistaken in supposing "that South Carolina wishes to enter into a conflict with him." Xot a State in the Union, w-e believe, has hadjmore confidence in his administration than South Carolina. Our people will reluctantly realize the fact, that he will place his administration in the van of the Abolition party of the North, to compel, by force of arms, a submission by the South to their authority.
