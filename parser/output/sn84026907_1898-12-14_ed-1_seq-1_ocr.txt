MONETARY REF0RM3 Increase of the Standing Army to 100,000 Men and tho Temporary , Continuance of Military Rule In New Possessions Favored. Washington, Dec. 5.?On the convening of congress today, President McKinley transmitted his aunual nnss'ge, which follows: To the Senate and House of Representatives: Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered necessary by the war our people rejoice in a fery satisfactory and steadily increasing degree of prosperity evidenced by the greatest volume of business ever recorded. Manufacture has been productive, agricultural- pursuits have yielded abundant returns, labor in the fields of industry is better rewarded, revenue legislation passed by the present congress has increased the treasury's receipts to the amount expected by its authors, . the finances of the government ? have been successfully administered and its credit advanced to the first rank, while its currency has been maintained at the vrorld'8 highest standard. Military service under a common flag for a righteous cause has strengthened the national spirit and served to cement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds between every section of the country. A review of the relations of the U ited States to other powers, always appropriate, is this year of primary importance i:i view of the momentous issues which have arisen, demanding in one instance the illota )>v urmg nnH invnlv ing farreachiug consequences which wiil | require the earnest attention of the congress. First Steps In the War. In tut last annual message very full consideration was given to the question of the duty of the government of the United States towards Spain and the Cuban insurrection as being by far the most important problem with which we were then called upon to deal. The considerations then advanced and the exposition oI the views therein expressed disclosed my sense of the extreme gravity of the situation. Setting aside as logically unfounded or practically advisable, the recognition of the independence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise between the contest- I ants, intervention in lavor of one or the ! other party, and forcible annexation of the island, I concluded it -was honestly J due to our friendly relations with Spain that she should lie given a reasonable , chance to realize her expectations of reform to which she had become irrevoca- i bly committed. The ensuing mouth brought little sign i of real progress toward the pacification j of Cuba. Xo tangible relief was nfforde 1 j the vast numbers of unhappy reconcen trados despite the reiterated professions , made in that regard a?nd the amount ap- i propriated by Spain to tin t en i. By the ; end of December the n o/tality amon^ ! them had frightfully increased. Conserv- j ative estimates from Spanish sources : placed the deaths among these distressed 1 people at over 40 per cent from the time ! General Weyler's decree of recouceutra- 1 tion was enforced. " Tho irar nn the old footino without comprehensive plan, developing only the game spasmodic encounters, bar- i ren of strategic result, that had marked the course of the tarlier ten years' relndlion, as well as the present insurrection | from its start. No alternative save physical exhaustion of either combatant and therewithal the practical ruin of the island lay in sight, but bow far distant no one could venture to conjecture. Blowing Up of the Maine. At this juncture, on Feb. 15. last, occurred the destruction of the battleship ilainj^ while,rightfully lying in the har T77~. 23 :et, Solicts a Share oi | bor of Havana on a mission of interna| tional courtesy and rock] will?a catastro| phe the suspicious nature and horror of which stirred the nation's heart proj foundly. It is a striking eMdence of the p poise and sturdy good sense distinguishing our national character that this shocking blovr, falling upon our generous people already deeply touched by preceding events in Cuba, did not move them to an instant, desperate resolve to tolerate no I longer the existence of a condition of dan| ger and disorder at our doors that made I possible such a deed by whomsoever wrought. Yet by instinct of justice patience prevailed and the nation anxiously awaited the result of the searching investigation at once set on foot. The finding of the naval board of inquiry established that the origin of the explosion was external by a submarine mine, and only halted through lack of positive testimony to fix the responsibility of its authorship, i All these things carried conviction to the most thoughtful, even before the finding of the naval court, that a crisis in our relations with Spain and toward Cuba was at hand. So strong was this j belief that it needed but a brief executive suggestion to the congress to receive im- J mediate answer to the duty of making in- j stant provision for ?oe possible and per- j haps speedily probable emergency of war, ! and the remarkable, almost unique, ! spectacle was presented of a unanimous j vote of both houses on March 9 appropri- ' ating $"0,000,000 "for the national defense j and for each and every purpose connected ; therewith, to be expended at the discre- j tion of the president." Still animated by the hope of a peaceful ! solution and obeying the dictates of duty, : /\ n /T/inf ^ eno varl t / ?

Grieved and disappointed at the barren outcome of my sincere endeavors to reach a practicable solution, I feit it my duty to remit the whole question to congress. The congress was asked to authorize and empower the president to take measures to secure a full and final termination of j hostilities between Spain and the people of Cuba. After nine days of earnest deliberation, during which the almost unanimous sentiment of your body was developed on every point save as to the expediency of coupling the proposed action with a formal recognition of the republic of Cuba the true and lawful government of that island?a proposition which failed of adoption?the congress, on April 19, by a vote of 42 to 35 in the senate and 311 to 6 in the bouse of representatives, passed the memorable joint resolution declaring the people of Cuba free and independent, demanding that Spain at ouce relinquish authority over the island and empowering the president to use the entire laud and , sea forces of the United States to that end. This resolution was approved by the executive on the next day, April 20. A copy was at once communicated to the Spanish minister at this camtal. who forthwith aunounced that his continuance in Washington had thereby become impossible, and asked for his passports, which were given him. Simultaneously with its communication to the Spanish minister. General Woodford, the American minister at Madrid, was telegraphed confirmation of the text of the joint resolution and directed to communicate it to the government of Spain with the formal demand that it at once relinquish its au- j thority and government in the is'and of Cuba and withdraw its forces therefrom. Rupture of Relations. That demand, although, as above shown, officially made known to the Spanish envoy here, was not delivered at Madrid. After the instructions reached General Woodford on the miming of April 21, but before ho could present it, the ' Spanish minister of state notified him that ! upon the president's approval of the joint | resolution, the Madrid government re garding the act as "equivalent to an evi- j dent declaration of war," had ordered its i minister in Washington to withdraw, j thereby breaking off diplomatic relations ; between the two countries. General Wood- j ford thereupon demanded his passports j ?*rwl t Via onmo rlo V ?u?* VjUlVVCU iUUUl i\4 WUV V?.? IL1V M?%J < " Spain having thus denied the demand ! of the United States and initiated that j complete form of rupture of relations j which attends a state of war, the execu | tive powers authorized by the resolution j were at once used by tne to meet the cn- j larged contingency of actual war between ; sovereign staves. By my message of April j 35 the congress was informed of the situa- j tion and I recommended formal declaration of the existence of a state of war be- j tween the United States and Spain. The : congress accordingly voted on the same j day the act approved April 25, 1S98, declaring the existence of such war from and including April 21 and re-enacted the provision of the resolution of April 20 dire*, ting the president to use all the armed , forces of the nation to carry that act into i effect. It is not within the province of this mes- : sage to narrate the history of the extraor- I dinary war that followed the Spanish j declaration of April 21. but a brief recital J of its more salieut features is apropos, j The first encounter of the war in point of j date took place April 2~. when a detach- j meut of the blockading squadron made a j recotinoisatire in force at Matanzas, J shelled tli2 b-irbor forts and demolished | several ne v works in construction.

At daybreak on the morning of May 1 the American force entered Manila bay and after a few hours engagement effected the total destruction of the Spanish fleet, consisting of ten warships and a transport, besides capturing the naval station and forts at Cavite, thus annihilating the Spanish naval power in the Pacific ocean and completely controlling the hay of Manila with the ability to take the city at will. Followiug the comprehensive scheme of general attack powerful forces were assembled at various points ou our coast to invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Meanwhile navai demonstrations were adopted at several exposed points. Young liobsoii's Brnve Deed. The next acts of the war thrilled not only the hearts of our countrymen, but the world by its heroism. On the night of June Lieutenant Hobsoa. aided by ilevoteri volunteers, blocked f.he nnr row outlet at Santiago harbor, by sinking the collier Merrimac in the channel under a fierce fire from the shore batteries, escaping with their lives as by a miracle, but falling into the hands of the Spaniards. They were subsequently exchanged. On June '2:1. the advance of the invading army under Major General Shafter landed at Daiquiri, about 15 miles east of Santiago. On July 1 a severe battle took place, our forces training the outworks at Santiago. On the second El Caney and San Juan were taken after a desperate charge and the investment of the city completed. On the diy following the brilliant achievement of our land force, July 3, occurred the decisive battle of the war. The Spanish fleet, attempting to leave the harbor, was met by the American squadron under command of Commodore Sampson. In less than three hours all the Spanish ships were destroyed, the two torpedo boats being sunk aud the Maria Teresa, Almirante Oquendo, Viscaya and Cristobal Colon driven ashore. The Spanish admiral and over 1.300 men were taken prisoners, while the enemy's loss of life was deplorably large, some <>03 perishing. On our side but one man was killed and one seriously wounded. With the catastrophe of Santiago Spain's power on the ocean virtually ceased. The capitulation of Santiago followed. The occupation of Porto Rico became the next stragetic necessity. General Miles hail previously been assigned to organize an expedition for that purpose. On July 27 he entered Ponce, one of the most important ports in the island, for which he thereafter directed operations for the Afinliipo nf l.Ke l'tland Tho comniimi .,-1 c

Negotiations For Peace. The annihilation of Admiral Cervera's fleet, followed by the capitulation of Santiago. having brought to the Spanish government a realizing sense of the hopelessness of continuing a struggle now becoming wholly unequal, it made overtures of peace through the French ambassador, On Aug. 12, M. Cambon, as the plenipotentiary of Spain and the secretary of state as the plenipotentiary of the United States, signed a peace protocol and I appointed William R. Day, lately secretary of state, Cushman K. Davis,'William P. Frye and George Gray, senators of the United States, and Whitelaw Reid to ba the peace commissioners on the part of j the United States. Proceeding in due ; time to Pari?, they there met on Oct. 1 j five commissioners similarly appointed on j the part of Spain. The negotiations have made hopeful progress, so that I trust ! soou to l>e able to lay a definite treaty of ; peace before the senate with a view of the steps leading to Its signature. Ldo not discuss at this time the govern- I ment or the future of the new possessions which will come to us as the result of the war with Spain. Such discussion will ba appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified. In the meantime, and uutil | the congress has legislated otherwise, it will be my duty to continue the military governments which have existed since our occupation and give to the people security in life and property and encouragement under a just and beneficient rule. As soon as we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified the island it will be necess uy to give aid and decision to its peopie to form a government of themselves. It should bo undertaken at the earliest moment consistent with safety and assured success. It is important that our relations with these people shall be of i the most friendly character and our commercial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island, encourage the industry of the people and assist them to form a government which shall be free and inde- j pendent, thus reali>:iug the best aspirations o; the Cuban people. Spauish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent ami humane government, created ny cue people of Cuba, capable of performing all international obligations, and which shall encourage thrift, industry and prosperity and promote peace and good will among all of tne inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither reveng nor passion should have ?a place in tiie new government. I'ntil there is complete tranquility in the islaud and a stable government inaugurated military occupation will be continued. With the exception of the rupture with Spain the intercourse of tlie Cuited States vutn the great family of nations has been marked with cordiality and the close of the event liuds most of the issues that necessarily arise in the complex relations of sovereign states adjusted or presenting no serious obstacle to a just and honorable solution by amicable agreement. The L ittiincr Tragedy. On Sept. 10, 1*97, n conflict took place at Irit timer, Pa., between a body of striking miners and the sheriff of Luzerne county and his deputies, in which 22 miners were ki!!c<l and 44 wounded, of which ten of the killed and 12 of the wounded were Austrian and Hungarian subjects. This deplorable event naturally aroused the solicitude of the Austro-Ifungarian government. which on the presumption that the killing and wounding involved the unjustifiable misuse of authority, claimed reparation for the sufferers. Apart from the searching investigation and peremptory action of the authorities of Pennsylvania the federal execuiive took appropriate stens to learn the merits of the case in order to "be In a posiuuu do the urgent complaint of a friendly power. The sheriff and his deputies, having been indicted for murder, were tried and acquitted after protr.ictel proceedings and the hearing of hundreds of witnesses on the ground that the killing was in the line of their official duty to uphold law and preserve public order in the state. A representative of the department of justice attended the trial and reported its course fully. With all the facts in its po DODS ;T, J13., iage. Prompt and 1 ! _ i session, this government expects to reach a harmonious u iderstauding on the subI j?ct with that of Austro-Hungary, notwithstanding the renewiKi claim of the i larier aim learning mi result 01 me I trial, for indemnity for its injured subjects. Nicaragua Canal ProJ-ct. j The Nicaraagua canal commisssion un! der the chairmanship of Hear Admiral j John G. Walker, appoiuted July 24, 1897, untfer the authority of a provision in the sundry civil act of June 4 of that year, ! has nearly completed its labors, and the i results of its exhaustive inquiry into the I proper route, the feasibility and the cost I of construction of an interoceanic canal ! by a Nicaraguan route will be laid before you. As the scope of recent inquiry embraced I the whole subject with the aim of making I plans and surveys for a canal by the most j convenient route, it necessarily included a ! review of the results of previous surveys i and plans and in particular those adopted j by the Maritime Caual company under its j existing concessions from Nicaragua and Costa Rico, so that to this extent those ! grants necessarily held an essential part I in th8 deliberations and couclusions of the ! canal commission as they have held and j must needs hold iu the discussion of the | matter before congress. Under these cir| cumstances and in view of overtures made i to the governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica by other parties for a new canal concession predicated on the assumed approacmng lapse 01 me contracts or rue Maritime Canal company with those states I have not hesitated to express my j conviction that considerations of expedi- I i ency and international policy as between j the several governments interested in the ! construction and control of an iuter; oceanic cuual by this route require the I maintniuanr.e of the status quo until the ! canal commission shall have reported and | the United States congress shall have had [ > an opportunity to pass finally upon the ' whole matter, without prejudice by rea! son of auy change in the existing condiI tions. All these circumstances suggest the urgency of some definite action by the congress at this session if its labors of the past are to be utilized and the linking of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a pracj tical waterway is to be realized. That the | construction of such a maritime highway ! is now more than ever indispensable to j that intimate ami ready intercommunicaI tion between our eastern and western sea! boards demanded by the annexation of | the Hawaiian Islands and the prospective ; expnusion of our influence and commerce in the Pacific and that our national policy now more imperatively than ever calls for Its control by this government, are propositions which I doubt not the congress ! will duly appreciate and wisely act upon. The Partition of China. The United States has.not been an indifferent spectator of the extraordinary J events transpiring in the Chinese empire, 1 whereby portions of its maritime pro- ! vinces are passing under the control of various European powers, but the prospect that the vast commerce which the 1 energy of our citizens and the necessity of our staple production for Chinese uses I has built up iu these regions may not be prejudiced through any exclusive treatj ment by the new occupants has obviated I the need of our country becoming an actor in the scene. I Our position among nations having a large Pacific coast, and a constantly expanding direct 1 rade with the farther Orient, gives us the equitable claim to consideration and friendly treatment in this regard and It will be my aim to subserve our large interests in that quarter by^jll means appropriate to the constant policy of our government. The territories of Kiao Chow, of Wei-IIai-Wei and of Port Arthur and Talieuwan, leased to Germany, Great Britain and Russia respectively for terms of years, will, it is announced, lie open to international commerce during such alien occupation, and if no discriminating treatment of American citizens and their trade be found to exist or be hereafter developed, the desire of this government would appear to bo i realized. .Meanwhile there may be just i ground for disquietude in view of the un! rest and revival of the old sentiment of opposition and prejudice to alien people ! which pervades certain of the Chinese provinces. As in the case of the attacks upon our citizens Jn Szechuan and at Kulien iu the I nited States minister has been instructed to secure the fullest ; measure 01 proiecuon. ouvii tuuti aim im| peris!. for any menaced American interj ests and to demand, in case of lawless injury to person or property, instantrepara; tion appropriate to the case. Warships : have been stationed at Tien Tsin for more ' ready observation of the disorders which ! have invaded the Chinese capital, so as to | be in a position to act should need arise, while a guar of marines has been sent to | j Peking to afford the minister the same measure of authoritative protection as the | j representatives of otiier nations have been | constrained to employ. The French (exposition* There is now every prospect that the i participation of the Cnited States in the j i universal exposition to be held in Paris in j i 1900 will be on a scale commensurate with j | t.he advanced position held by our pro- ! Two Pointed Questions Answered. I j I "What is the use of making a better article than your competitor if I you can not get a better price for it ? j j Ans.?A* there is no difference in j tbe price the public will buy only j i the better. ?o that while our profits j ! may be smaller on a single sale they j will be much greater in the aggre| gate.

Handy, who, under the act approved July 19. 1897. was appointed special commissioner with a view to securing all attainable information necessary to a full and complete understanding by congress In regard to the participation of this government in the Paris exposition, was laid before you bf my message of Dec. 6. 1S97, and showed the large opportunities to make knowu our national progress in manufactures, as well as the urgent need of immediate and adequate provision to enable due advantage th-.-reof to be taken. Mr. Handy's deitii soon afterward rendered it necessary for another to take up and complete the unfinished work, and on Jan. 11 last Mr. Thomas W. Cri ller, third assistant secretary of state, was designated to fulfill that task. By a provision in the sundry civil appropriation act of July 1,. 11?9S. a sum not to exceed $650,OX) was allotted for the organization of a commission to care for the proper preparation and installation of American exhibits and for the display of suitable exhibits by the several executive departments, particularly by the department of agriculture, the fish commission and the Smithsonian Institution, in representation of the government of the United States. Pursuant to that enactment, I appointed Mr. Ferdinand W. Pec* of Chicago commissioner general, with au assistant commissioner general and secretary. Mr. Peck at once proceeded to Paris, where his success in eulargiDg the scope and variety of the United t-tatos exhibit has been most gratifying. Notwithstanding the comparatively limited area of the exposition site?less than one half that of the World's Fair at Chicago?the space assigned to the United States Ins been increased from the absolute allotment of 157,403 square feet reported by -Mr. llaudy to some 000 square feet, with corresponding augmentation of the field for a truly characteristic representation of the various important branches of our couutry's development. Mr. Peck's report will be laid before you. In my judgment its recommendations will call for your early consideration, especially as regards an increase of the appropriation to at least $1,000,(XX) in all, so that not only may the assigned space be fully taken up by the best possible exhibits in every class, but the preparation and installment be on so perfect a scale as to rank among the first in that unDaralleled competition of artis tic and iuventive production and thus counterbalance the disadvantages with which we start us compared with other countries whose appropriations are on a more generous scale and whose preparations are in a state of much greater forwardness than our own. Annexation of Hawaii. Pending consideration by the senate of the treaty sigtfed June ltt, 1897. by the plenipotentiaries of the United States and j of the republic of Hawaii, providing for j the annexation of the islands, a Joint resolution to accomplish the same purpose by accepting the offered cession and incorporating the ceded territory into the Union was adopted by the congress and approved July 7. 1S9S. I thereupon directed the United States steamer Philadelphia to convey Rear Admiral Miller to Honolulu and entrusted to his hands this important legislative act to be delivered to the president of the republic of Hawaii,with whom the admiral and the United States minister were authorized to make appropriate arrangements for transferring the islands, to the United States. This was simply but impressively accomplished on Au \ 12 by the delivery of a certified copy of tbe resolution to President Dole, who thereupon yielded up to tbe representa- . tives of the government of the United f States the sovereignty and the publio ! property of the Hawaiian Islands. Pursutnt to the terms of the joint reso- j lution and in exercise of the authority \ thereby conferred upon me, I directed j that tbe.civil, judicial and military pow- I ers theretofore exercised by the officers of ! the government of the republic of Hawaii should continue to he exercised by those officers until congress shall provide a govor-nnif.nl fnr the ineornorated terrltorv. i subject to ray power to remove such ofli- j cers hu'1 to fill vacancies. The president, ) officers aud troops of the republic there- I upon took the oath of allegiance to the ! United States, thus providing for the un- ! interrupted continuances of nil t he admin- ! istrative and municipal functions of the j annexed territory until congress shall j otherwise enact. Following the farther provision of the ! joint resolution I appointed the Hons, j Shelby M. Callom*of Illinois. John T. Morgan of Alabama, Robert R. Hitt of Illinois Sanford B. Dole of Hawaii and Walter F. Frear of Hawaii as commissioners to confer and recommend to congress, aucti legislation concerning the Hawaiian, i Islands as they should deem necessary o? ! proper. The commissioners having fulfilled the mission confided to them their work wilL be laid before you at an early day. It is believed that their recommendations will ( have the earnest consideration due to the . magnitude of the responsibility resting I upon you to give such shape to the rela- j tionship of those mid pacific lands to our j home Union as will benefit both in the ? highest degree, realizing the aspirations t of the community that has cast its lot y with us and elected to share our political j heritage while at the same time justify- \ ing the foresight of those who for three : quarters of :t century have looked to the [ assimilation of Hawaii as a natural and ^ inevitable consummation in harmony f with our needs and in fulfillment of our ? cherished traditions. Under the provisions of the joint resolu- > tions the existing customs relations of the Hawaiian Islands with the United States and with other countries remain unchatUvd until legislation shall otherwise provide. The consuls of Hawaii, here and in foreign countries continue to fulfill their commercial agencies, while the United Stales consulate at Honolulu is in iiutaine.1 for all proper services pertaining to trade and revenue. It would he desirable That all foreign consuls iti the Hawaiian Islands should receive new ex* equaters from this government. Czar's Disarmament I'lan.

The active military forcj of the United States as measured by our population, territorial area and taxable wealth, is and under any conceivable prospective conditions must continue to be in time of peace so conspicuously less than that of tha armed powers to whom the czar's appeal is es;>ecially addressed that the question can have for us ro practical importance save as marking an auspicious step toward the ljetterm fit of the condition o( the modern peoples and the cultivation ol peace and good will among them, but in this view ic behooves us as a nation to lend countenance and aid to the beneGcent project. The Currency Question. The secretary of the treasury report? that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 3), 1808, including $84,751,223 received from sale of Pacific railroads, amounted to $405,321,335- and its expenditures 10 $443,353 532. There wns collected fgom customs $140,575,052 and from internal revenue $170,900,041. Our dutiable imports amounted to $3*24.735,479, a decrease of $53,150,000 over the preceding year, and importations free of duty amounted to $21)1,414,175. a decrease from the preceding year of $90,524,003. Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of the preceding year by $24,212,063. The total tax collected on distilled spirits was W,.W),WI/, on manuiaciurcu tobacco $36 230,523 and 0:1 fermented liquors $39,515,42!. We exported merchandise during the year amounting to $1,231,482,330, ail increase of $180,488,771 from the preceding year. It is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts from the government for the year ending June 30, J899, will be $577,874,007 and its expenditures $080 874.047. resulting in a deficiency of $1I2.(X)0,000. On Dec. 1, 1898, there was held in the treasury gold coin amounting to $138,441,547. gold bullion amounting to $130,592,545, silver bullion amounting to $93,359,250 and other forms of money amounting to $451,963,981. On the same date the amount of money of all kinds in circulation or not included in treasury holdings was $1,866,879,509, an increase for the year of $16>.794;966. Estimating our population at 75,194,000 at the time mentioned the per capita circulation was $25.09. On the same date there was in the treasury gold bullion amounting to $133,502,545. The provisions made for strengthening the resources of the treasury in connec tion with the war has given increased confidence in the purpose and the power of the government to maintain the present standard both established more firmly than ever the national credit at home and abroad. A marked evidence of this is found in the inflow of gold to the treasury. Its net gold holdings on Nov. 1, 1898, were *239,885,160 as compared with $153,573,147 on Nov. 1. 1897, and an increase of net cash of $2 -7,756, b O Nov. 1, 1897, to *300,238,275 Nov. 1.189S. The present ratio of net treasury gold outstanding government liabilities including United States notes, treasury notes of 18%, silver certificates, standard silver dollars and fractional silver coin Nov. 4. 1898, waj 25.35 per cent as compared with lti.9G per cent Nov. 1, 1897. Redemption of Notes. I renew so much of my recommendation of December, 1897, as follows. "That when any of the United States notes arc presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold such uotes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. This Is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the government, he should not. receive back from the government a United States note without paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the government issues an interest bearing debt to provide gold for lbe redemption of United Seates notes?a . noninterest bearing debt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put in any other way they may return again, to be followed by another bond issue to redeem them?another interest bearing debt tore deem a noninterest bearing debt.'' Th s recommendation was made in the belief that such provisions of law would 1 .1 c .u insure a greater uegree iucsmicij iuc present standard and better protect our currency from the dangers to which it i? subjected from a disturbance in tlie general business conditions of the country. In my judgment, the present condition of the treasury amply justifies the immediate enactment of the legi-uation recommended one year ago. under which ;t portiou of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund, from whi- h greenbacks should be redeemed upon pres-ntation. but when once redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold. It is not to be inferred that other legis? lafion relating to our currency is not re quired: on the contrary, th?-ro is an ob* vious demand for it. The importance of adequate provisioa which will insure to our luture a money ! standard, related as our money standard now is to that of our commercial rivals, is generally recognized. The companion proposition that our domestic paper currency shall be kept, safe and yet be so related to the needs of our industries and internal commerce as to la; adequate and responsive to such needs is a proposition scarcely less important. The subject, ia all its parts, is commended to the wise consideration of the congress. BucKiens Arnica saive.

Under the act of congress approved April 28, 18U8 authorizing the president, in his discretion, "upon a declaration of war by congress, or a declaration by congress that war exists," directed the increase of the regular army to the maximum of 62,000, authorized in said act. There are now in the regular array 57,86i officers and men. In said act it was provided "that at the eqd of any war in which the United States may become involved the army shall be reduced to a peace basis by the traisfer of the same arm of the service or absorption by promotion or honorable discharge under such regulations as the secretary of war may establish of supernumerary commissioned omcers and the honorable discharge or tbs transfer of supernumerary enlisted men, and nothing contaiued in this act shall be construed as authoring the permanent increase, of the commissioned or enlisted force of the regular army beyond that uow provided by the law in force prior to the passage of this act, except as to ths increase of 25 majors provided for in seo* tion I hereof." J The importance of legislation for the permanent increase of the army is therefore manifest and the recommendation of the secretary of war for that purpose has my unqualified approval. There can be no question that at this time and probably for some time in the future 100,000 men will be noue too many to meet the necessities of the situation. At all events, whether that number shall be required permanently or not, the power should be given to the president to enlist that force if in his discretion it should be necessary, and the further discretion should be given liim to recruit for the army within the above limit from the inhabitants of the islands with the government of which we are charged. It is my purpose to muster out the entire volunteer array as soon as the congress shall provide for the increase of the regular establishment. This will be only an act of justice and will be much appreciated by the brave men who left (their homes aud employment to help the country in its emergency. ? Washington's Centennial.

UUXI* J VI VUVrf IVUUUtU^ Vi VUO city of Washington for the permanent capital of tbe government of the United States by authority of an act of congress approved July 1*5, 1790. In May 1800 the archives and gegeral offices of the federal government was removed to this place. On Xov. 17, 1800, the national congress met here for the first time and assumed exclusive control of the federal district and city. This Interesting event assumes ail tbe more significance when we Recall the circumstances attending the choosing of tbe site, the naming of the capital iu honor of the father of his country and the interest taken by him in the adoption of plans for its future develop* nient on a magnificent scale. A movement lately inaugurated by thf citizens to have the anniversary celebrated with ftting ceremonies including perhaps the establishment of a handsome permanent memorial to mark so historical an occasion and to give it more than local recognition has met with general favor oa the part of tbe public. I recommend to the congress the granting of an appropriation for this purpose and the appointment of a committee from its respeceive bodies. It might also be advisable to aatnorize the president to appoint a committee from the country at large, which, acting with the congressional and District of Colnm* bia committees, can complete the plana lot an appropriate national celebration. Pension Statistic*. There were on the pension rolls on Jane 80, 1898, 993,714 names, an increase of nearly 18,000 over the number of the rolls . for the same day of the preceding year. The amount appropriated by the act of Dec. 22. 1896, for the payment of pensions for the fiscal year 1898 was $140,000,000. By the act of March 31, 1898, $8,070,872.4$ was appropriated to cover deficiencies la army pensions and repayment* in the sum of $12,020.35, making a total of $148,*. 082,892.79 available for the payment of pensions during the fiscal year 1898. The amount disbursed from that sum was $144.6.31.879.80, leaving a balance of $3,431,* 012.99 uuexpended on Jane 30, 1898, which was covered into the treasury. There were 389 men added to the roll* during the year by special acta at the second session of the Fifty-fifth congress, making a total of 6,486 pensioners by con? gressional enactments since 1891* Supreme Courtroom. I deem it my duty to call to the atten* / * \ tion of congress the condition of the present building occupied by the department - ^ of justice.
