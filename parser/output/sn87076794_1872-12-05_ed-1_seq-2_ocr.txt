To the Senate and House of Represontatives: To the Senate and House of Represontatives: THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY. In transmitting to you my fourth Annual Message it is with thankful ness to the Giver of all good that as a nation we have been blestted for the !&rt year with ncaee at home and abroad and a general prosperity, vouchsafed to but few peorde.with the exception of the recent devastating tire which swept from the earth with a breath as it were minions of accu mulated wealth in the city of Boston. There have been two over-shadowing -aIamities within the year to record, it is gratifying to note here, like their fellow citizens of the city of Chicago, under similar circumstances a year , r arher, the citizens of lloton are ral- j Iviri" under their roisionunes, nn the pro-pect is that their energy and' jo-rveranee will overcome all obsta cles Mid fchow the Rame prosperity soon that they would have shown bad no disaster befallen them. Otherwise, we have been free from pestilence, war and calamities which often overtake nations, and, as far as human Judg ment can penetrate th future, no cause seems to exist to threaten our THE 

ALABAMA CLAIMS ARBITRATION. When Congress adjourned in June last a- ojestion had been raised by (reat Britain, and was then pending, which, for a time, seriously imperiled the settlement ty friendly arbitration of tbe dillerenc?3 existing between thU government and that of Her Jirittsnic Majesty by tli Treaty of Washington, had been referred to the Tribunal of Arbitration which had met at Geneva, in Switzerland. The arbitrators, however, disposed of the question which hail jeopardized the whole of the treaty and threatened to involve the two nation in most un happy relations toward each other. In a manner entirely satisfactory to this government and in accordance with me views and the policy which it had maintained. The "Tribunal, which had convened in Geneva in Decem ber, concluded its laboriorw session-on th. 14Ui dav of jeotember last, on which .day,, juaving availed, ituelf or . the discretionary power given to it oy the treaty to award a sum ia gro-.s. It made its decision, whereby it awarded the sum of 35,oOt),(M0 tb gold as the indemnity to bo paid by Great Britain to the United 8tates,for the ratification of ail the claims re ferred to its consideration. This deci sion hsppiiy disposes of a long stand ing difference between the two gov ernments, and ia connection with an other award made by the German Kmperor under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves these two gov ernments without a shadow upon the frieudly relations which it is toy sin cere hope may forever remain equal ly unclouded. The report of the agent of the Unit ed tSUte appointed to attend the Ge neva Tribunal, accompanied by the protocols of the proceedings of the ar mtrators. the ar uuieliU of the coun sel of both governments, the award of the Tribunal, aud the riuwus- given by the several arbitrator?,-is trans 111 it ted herewith. I liave caused to be communicated to the. heads of the three friendly powers vho complied with the joint request made to them under tbe treaty, the thanks of this government for the appointment ot arbitrators made by them respective ly, and al0 my thanks to the emi nent persons named by them, and my appreciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality and great ability with which they discharged their orders and high functions. Her Majesty s government has communicated to me its appreciation by her Majesty of the abilitv and indefatigable industry dis played by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named on me pari oi iuis goveru nieut during tbe protracted inquiries and discussions of tbe Tribunal. I cordially unite with her Majesty in this appreciation. It is due to the agent of the United States before the Tribunal to record my hiaib apprecia tion of the marked abdity, unwearied iiatlenras ait tt prul-rcs and discre tion with which ho has conducted th very responsible and delicate duties committed to hi 4, as it is also due to th learned and eminent counsel who attended the Tribunal on the part of hu trove meiit. to express my sense ,ft! t-ilents and wisdom which they i.t-nno-httoheirip! heareument. It will be the province oi Congress to provide for the distribution among those who may be entitled to it of their respec tive shares of the money to be paid. Aithoncrii the sum awarded Is not navable until a year from the date of the award, it is deemed advisable that no time be lost in making a proper oTmnation of the several cases in which indemnification may be due. J onncenueutlv recommend the crea tion of a board of commissioners for th nuroose of the Sun Juan boundary iWiNion. BV the third and fourth ,.rtip'.w .if ihe Treaty of Wash ington the respective claims of the United .Stales and of Great Britain in their construction of the Treaty of the loth of June, 1S46. deliuing the boundary line between their respective territories were sub mitted to the arbitration and award of His Majesty the Emperor of Ger many to decide which of those claims is most in accordance with the true interpretation of the Treaty of 1M6. His Majesty, the Kmperor of Ger many, having been pleased to under cut,, the arbitration, has the earnest thanks of this gover nment and of the people of tbe United Sta'.es for the la - oor, pains and care v-nica no nas oe- voted to the consideration oi tnisionp neudicg d.;!erence. I have-caused an expression of my thanks to be com municated to HU Majesty. Mr.Bau croft, the renresenUtive of this gov ernment at H-?rIiu,ciiiducted the case and prepared the j-tnieicent on the part of the United States, with the ability that 4iis past M-rvice justified the public in exacting Rt his hands. As a member of the cabinet at the date of he Treaty wh.ch has given rise to the discussion between the two povern incuts, as the Minister to Great Britain whn the construction now pronounced uufouuded was first ad vanced, and a the agent a-id repre peutativeof the government to pre entthe case and to receive the award, he has been associated with the ques tion in all of Its phases, and in every .tage Las manifested a patriotic zeal unS earnestness in the maintenance of the claim of the United States; he is entitled to much credit for the sue crhirli has attended tbe submis sion. After a patient investigation of the case and of tbe statements oi eacu partv. His Majesty the Emperor, on the -list dav of October last.signed his award in writing, decreeing that the l:iim of the covernment of the L ui- ted States that the boundary line be tween the territories of Her Britannic Majesty and the I niled tetates suouia be drawn through the Haro channel, is most in accordance with the true interpretation of tbe Treaty conclud ed on the 15th dsy of June, 184G, be tween the agentx of Her Britannic Majesty and the United States. THE SAN JUAN QUESTION. Copies of the case presented on be half of each government, and cf the statement iu reply of each and a translation of tiie award are transmit ted herewith. This award confirms the United States in their claim to the important archipelago of islands ly ing between the continent and Van couver's Island, which for twenty-eix years, ever since the ratification of the treaty, Great Rritain has contes ted, and "leaves ns for the first time in the history of the United States a na tion without a question of disputed boundary lietween our territory - and the posnessiona of Great Britain on this continent. It is my gratefui du ty to acknowledge the prompt, spon taneous action of Her Majesty's gov ernment in giving effect to the award. In anticipation of any request from this government, and before tlie re ception in United States of the award nigned by the Emperor, Her Majesty had eiven instructions for the remov al of her troops which had been tinned mere, and for the tjessatl all exercise or ciaim of junsdicti as to leave tlie United States i elusive "i u. late.y u,,i- tea lerriuirjr. 4 u.

This question has since been disposed of, and I haye re ceived notice that the Imperial Parlia ment and the legislature of the prov incial government have passed laws to carry the provisions of the treaty on the matters referred to into ra tion. I therefore recommend your early adoption of the legislation in the same direction necessary on the part of this government.

OUR RELATIONS WITH EUROPE. Witii France, our earliest ally: Russia, the constant and steady friend of the United tStates; Germany, with whose government aud people we jjaTe gomaar causes of friendship and manv COmmon sympathies, and the other powers of Kurope, our re lations are maintained on the mot frieudly terms since my last annual message. The exchange has been made of the ratifications of a treaty with the Austrian and Hungarian empires, relating to naturalization; also of a treaty with the German em pire respecting consuls and trade marks; also of a treaty with Swetdeu and Norway relating to naturalization, ail of which treaties have been duly proclaimed. THE DISTRESS OF CURE—THE OBVIOUS CAUSE. It Is with regret that 1 have again to announce a continuance of the dis turbed condition of the island of Cu ba... No advance toward the pacifica tion of tbe discontented part of the population has been made, while tbe insurrection has gained no advanta ges and exhibits no more of the ele ments of power or of tbe prospect of ultimate success than were exhibited a year ago. Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded in its suppression, ami the parties stand apparently iu the same relative attitude which they have occupied for a law' time past. ThU contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were it seen at a distance from our neighborhood we might be indifftreiit to its result, al though humanity could not bo un moved by many of its incidents wherever they might orcur. It Is, however, at our door. IcauBot doubt that the continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is among the strongest inducements to the continuance of this strife. A ter rible wrong is the result of a terrible evil. The aDontioH or slavery aim the introduction of other reforms in the administration of government in Cuba could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. It is especially to be hoped that the pres ent liberal government of Spain will voluntarily adopt this view. 'mm law ot emancipation, which was passed more than two years since, has remained'unexecuted in the absence of regulations for its enforcement. It was but a feeble step toward emanci pation but it was tue recognition oi right and was bailed as such, and ex hibited in Spain in harmony with the sentiment of Justice and of hu manity, and in sympathy with the other powers of the christian and civ ilized world, witnin ine last lew weeks the regulations for carrying out the laws of emancipation have been announced, giving evidence of the sincerity of the intentions of the pres ent government to carry into eilect the law of 1871. I have not failed to urge the consideration of the wisdom, tbe noliev and the justice of a more efletive system for the abolition of the great evil which oppresses a race and continues a bloody and destruct ive contest close to our border, as well as the expediency And Justice of con ceding reforms of which the proprie ty is not questioned. Deeply im pressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is one of the most active ca jses of the continuance of the unhappy condition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizeks of the United .States, or those claiming to be such, are large hoiders in Cuba of what is there claimed as property, but which is forbidden and denouue- j ed by the laws of the United States , xiiey are thus in defiance of the spirit i ofour jawg contributing to tbe con- tinuance of this distressing contest. In mv last annual message, I referred to this subject, aud I again recom mend such legislation as may oe prop er to denoan.ee, and if not prevent, at least to aiscomage A.mncan citizens from holding or dealing in siav. it is gratifying ta announce that the ratification of the convention con cluded, under the auspices of this government, between Spain on the one part, and the allied Republics of the Pacific on the other, providing for an armistice, have been exchanged; a copy of the instrument is herewith submitted. It is hoped that this may be followed by a permanent peace be tween the iame parties. RELIEF OF DISTRESSED CITIZENS ABROAD. Congress, from the beginning government, has wisely made provi sion for the relief of distressed sea men in foreign countries. "No simi lar provision, however, has hitherto been made fr the relief of distressed citizens abroad other than seamen. It is understood to be customary with other governments to authorize con suls to extend such relief to their citi zeus or subjects in certain cases. A similar authority and an appropria tion to carry it into effect are pom mended, in case of citizens of the United States, destitute or sick uuaer such circumstances. It is well kuown tbat such citizens resort to foreigu countries in great numbers, though most of them are able to tear the ex pense incident to locomotion. There are some who, through accident or otherwise, become penniless, and have no friends at home able to succor them. Persons in this situation must eith er perish or cast themselves upon the charity of foreigners or be relieved at the private charge of our own officers, wha usually, even with the most be nevolent 'dispositions have noth ing to spare. Should the au thority and appropriation be asked for. care will be taken ta carry the beneficence of Congress into effect so that it shall be unnecessary or unworthily bestowed.

All war accounts for money and property prior to lb7I, nave been ex amined aud transmitted to the treasu ry for final settlement.

POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT. j f ; a ; of at of of be . it f to or all The accompany report of the Postmaster-General furnishes a full and satisfactory exhibit of the op erations of the Post Office Department during tbe year. Tne ordinary revenue of the departmeut for the fiscal year.cnding June 3D, 1S72, amounted to $21,915,426.37, and the expenditure $2o,6oS,192.21. Com pared with the previous fiscal year the increase of revenue was $1,873, 9S0.95, or 9.37 per Cent, and tbe in crease of expenditures $2,203,033.2 or 920 per cent. Adding to the ordinary n-venue the annual appreciation ot $700,0o0 for free matter, and the amounts paid to the subsidies on mail steamship lines from special appro priations, the deficiency paid out of tue general Treasury was-yrs,TH. 1S71. Other statistical information relating to our lliull" "T . ' ramdlv extending postal service is furnished in this report. The total length of railroad mail routes ou the 30tn of Juue, 1872, was 57,011 miles, 8,077 additional miles of bucU service having been put into operation during the year. Eight new lines of railway postofiices have been established, with an aggregate length of 2,900 miles. The number of letters ex changed in the mails with foreign countries was 21,302,500, an increase of 4,000,502, or twenty per cent, over the number in 1871, and the postage thereon amounts to $1,S71,2j7.25. The total weight of tlie mails exchanged with European countries exceeded S20 tons. The cost of the United States traus-Atlautio nriil steamship service was $22,030,170. Tne total cost of the United States ocean steam ship service, including the amounts paid to the subsidized lines of mail steamers, was $102,702,097. The fol lowing are the only steamship lines uow -receiving subsidies for mail ser vice under special acts of Congress: The Pacific -Mail Steamship Compa ny receive S-joO.O'iO per auiiutn, for carrying a monthly mail between San Fraiiciseo, Japan, and China, which will be increased to 1,!MX),000 per annum for a sami-inonthly mail, on and after October 1, 1S7J. The United States aud Brazil Mail steam ship Company receive 150, 0 per annum for carrying a monthly mail between New York ami Rio de Janer io, Brazil, and tbe California, Oregon, aud Mexico Steamship Company re ceive $75,000 per annum for carrying a monthly mail between Sin Francis co aud Honolulu, Hawaiia Islands, making the total amout of mail cu.naship uubsidics at preseut $725, 000 per annum. Oiir noatal ootnniuuioatiom with all parts of the civilized world have been placed upon a most advantageous footing by the improved postal con ventions, and the arrangements rc- eeutlv concluded with tlie leading commercial countries of Europo and America. The gratifying statemeut is made that, with the couclusion of a satisfactory convention with France, tne details 01 wmuu uavu ueeu ueu nitely agroed to by the head of the French postal department, subject to the approval of tho Minister of Fi nance, little remains to be accom plished by the treaty for some time to come, iu respect to the reduction of rates fcr improved facilities for postal Intercourse. Your favorable consid eration is respectfully invited to the recommendations made by the Post master General for an increase of ser vice from monthly to semi-mounthly trips on tne mail steamship route to Brazil; far a subsidy inside of the es tahiisnment of an American line ot mail steamera between San Francisco, New Zealand and Australia; for the eatablishment of post offices, savings banks, and for the increase of the sal aries of heads of bureaus. I have heretofore recommended the abolition of the franking privilege, and aee no reason now for changing my viewsoathat subject. It not tiaving been favorably regarded by Congress, however, I now suggest a m-juinci-tion of that privilege to correct its glaring and costly abuses. I would also recommend tne appointment 01 a committee or commission to tike in to consideration the best method, equitable to private corporations who have invested their time and cipirul in the establishment of telegraph lines of acquiring tho title to ah telegraph liues now ia operation, aud of connecting this service with tha postal service of the nation. It u not probable that this subject could re ceive tne proper consideration during the limits of a short session of Con gress, but it may bo initiated so that further aotion may be fair to the gov ernment and to private parties con cerned.

EDUCATION. j j : The rapidly increasing interest in education is a most encouraging fea tura in tbe current history of the country, and is no doubt true that this is due in a great measure to the elfecU of the .Bureau of Education. That alnco is continually receiving evidences which abundantly prove its efficiency, from the various institu tions of learning and educators of all kinds throughout the country. Tbe report of the commissioner contains a vast amount of educational details of srreat interest The bill now pending before Congress providing for the ap propriation of part of the proceeds of the sales of public lands for education al purposes, to aid the states in the general educttioti of their rising gen eration is a measure of such great im portance to our real progress, and is so unanimously approved by the leading friends of education, that I commend it to the favorable attention of Congress. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. An earnest desire has eorrect the abuses which have grown up iu the civil service of the country, through the defective method of mak iug appointment to otH.ee, which has breu regarded too much as the reward of political services. Under authori ty of Congress, rules have been estab lished to regulate the terms of office and t'ce mode of appointments. It cannot bo r t j-"''" li i 1 1 1 ivuf. liwuC'iouieiiy for existing j , M r j . evils until thev have been thoroughly tested by actual practice, and aaiend e.l according to the requirements of tlie service. During my term of of gc it shall ba -uiy best endeavor to so apply the rules as to secure t!u greaiest possible reform iu the c;v;l service of the government, but it win require the direct attention of Con gress to render tha enforcement of tiie system binding upon my success ors, aud I hope that the experience of the past year, togeiher witii appropri ate legislation by Congress.may reach a satisfactory solution of the question, and secure to the public" service for all time,a practical method for obtain ing faithful and efficient officers and U.

These were the sad words that were telegraphed from Tarrytown, X.

Horace Greeley was lorn in Am herst, Xow Hampshire, February 2, 1S11, and at an ear.y age he showed au eagerness for acquiring knowledge, and decided to be a printer.

At lost, on Tuesday, the 12th inst,, he abandoned : nis eflort to visit the office regularly, and sent for the family physician of i Mr. A- J.

Daring the nieht he slept very uneasily, muttering occa sionally, and frequently raising his risht hand. Toward the morning he was more quiet, and between 8 and 9 o'clock fell into nearly an unconscious condition, which continued with some intervals through the day. He made occasional exclamations, but most of them, in consequence of his extreme weakness and apparent ina bility to finish what ho began, were unintelligible. About noon, howev er be said quite distinctly, and with some force, 'I know that my Redeem er liveth.' During the day he recog nized various people, his daughter many times, the members of his household at Chappaqua, Mr. John R. iStuart and Mr. Reid. "On the whole, he suffered little, seemed to have no more than the or dinary restlessness which accompan ies the last stage of the disease.

Iu the( account narrating at length the clos ing days of the late Mr. Greeley, he is said during his western tour to have never slept over four hours at a time. Through the day he would often doze in the car aud catch a snatch of sleep. Upon his return to Xew York his wife was found rapid- oieepless night at her bedside that he first began to show signs of mental depression. On one occasion, while the opposition press wn9 circulating his Pittsburgh speeoh, ne said, "If they make issue that I'm the rebel candidate I'm bound to be defeated." This consideration seemed to weigh on his mind. Often when he sup posed he was alone he would, put ins hands to his head and cry out, "Oh" a though suffering intense pain. At lenetb. when his wife died, he hecan to show manifestations of great grief and it was tnen te is said to have shown the first positive evidences of mental derangement. The Novem ber election seemingly did not inter est him. His defeat did not seem to surprise him. He deceived his friends by receiving the news with indiffer ence. On November Sth, one day alter tne printing or ns ramoua caru, an editorial article appeared in the Tribune, headed, "Conclusions" It was simply a summing np of the re sult of the elections, in Greeley's old style. This was his last professional eflort. About this time he revised flvo articles which he carfully pre pared for tho encyclopedia. They are entitled "Abolition," "Agriculture," "Anti-Masonry,,, "Caucus," "South ern Confederacy," the latter being his history of the "American Conllict," revised. Oue day later, while In con versation with a friend, he became visibly affected and said tcuching a remark as to his candidature : "I don't care for politics, and wouldn't go on the cars to Washington to get a commission as President. What I do feel is the loss of my companion of nearly forty years. I have watched by her bed side night and day; now I am completely worn out with anxi ety and want of sleep." On November 15th Mr. Greeley was at his borne in Chappaqua, and a prominent Liborai Republican from Connecticut visited him and found ui4- . ; -Pii health.

About thia time h seemed restless and haggard ia ap pearance. His family pbysiciaa rec ognized it as serious and at ouce re sorted to the most energetic treat ment. At first it seemed as though the malady would yield. Medical treatment, however, proved inflec tual. ; Congress convened Monday last. a Hon. Chas.
