The Abolitionists tell their noodles that the rebels are delighted with the success of the Democracy In the free states.

Now we undertake to say in the ace of the Louisville Democrat, that whon the "conspirators who got up this rebellion," saw vhe Democracy of the free states fighting to provent the Abolitionists from cutting (IT their supplies, that they felt under ten thousand obligations to them for their services, their aid to put down their enemies tbo AbolitionWt aud we undeitaka to Bay further, that wheu tho ''conspirators" learn ed that tho Democracy were snccos- (ol at the November elections, that tho abolitionists were defeated at the polls, that they and their tiegroes wero sule, that their. supplies were in no danger, aud that tbo safety ot their negroes, their supplies, has been secured by the labors of the Democracy of tbe free dates, at tbe ballot box, that they will be highly ratified at the result of the Novem bcr elections that the result of these electious, will give, them "aid" will givetbem "comfort," will give them confidence."
