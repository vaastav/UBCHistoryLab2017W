Sherman officially announcing the death of Brevet Mai. Gen. Jeff. C. Davis. The order after detailing his military career in commen­ datory terms, concludes as follows: Though only colpnel ^f.thtf Twenty-third Infantry at time of death, his fame and history belong to the whole army, and the flags pf.. all mili­ tary posts will bS displayed at half-mast the day after the receipt of this order.

Jack finished his testimony Dec. 4, and the commission delivered its nltimatum. It is the surrender of eleven Indians to be held for trial on charge of murdering Agent Meeker and the employes. Dourlass is in­ cluded among the number. Ouray asked for time, and was allowed forty-eight hours. If he succeeds in farming a coalition with Jack and Colorow he will puobably be able to carry out the demands of the commission. The In­ dians engaged in the fight with Thornburgh are not included in the list. A council of In dians was held at Ouray's on the night of Dee. 4. The result of its deliberations would be known the next day. A MURDERER'S BODY FOUND. Tbe remains oi a man supposed to bo Fred Goltz, who shot Mrs. Shauer. of Hender­ son of Sibley county, Minn, last spring was found Dec. 2 by a boy of Charles Shauer while huntibg rabbits, in thick hazel brush, about 100 yards from the house, in the town of Green ble, where Mrs. Shauer was shot. The bones are all there, and attached together In regular form, except the head, which lies a few feet off. Tbe boots are on the feet, and considera­ ble of his clothing lies scattered around. His revolver and a box of cartridges are lying be side the bones. This information is from parties who have seen the remains just as they were found, and is correct The coroner will hold an inquest to-morrow. There is no doubt the remains are those of Goltz. GEN. GRANT IN CHICAGO. Gen. Grant, on the afternoon of Dec. 5, paid a brief visit to tbe rooms of the Aeade my of design. He spent the evening at the residence of Col. Fred Grant, a very small company being present. The annual dinner of the Chicago Commercial club, Dec. C. at the Grand Pacific hotel promised to be an event of considerable commercial significance, as well as unusual elegance. A large delega­ tion from the Boston Commercial club ar rived on the eveniog of Dec. 6, as guests of the Chicago club, and representatives of the boards of trade of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Indianopo 11s, Pittsburgh, St Louis, and other cities were In the cuy, or would be Dec. G. Gen. Grant is one of the invited guests, and has indicated his purpose of being present. 

JACK THE INDIAN. The commission at the Los Pinos Agen ey is reported to be progressing finaly. Jack (Dec. 4)_was still on the stand. So far he has proved the most valuable witness yet ex­ amined, answering all questions promptly keeping nothing back. He claims the re­ moval of the agency was the commencement of trouble that a land elevation of 8,700feet with frost every month in the year, farming was impos8eble that he and his bands re­ ceived no rations for a year, which he claims was a violation of the treaty of 1868 that the engagement was a fair fight He calls Doug las a squaw man for his having attacked the agency, and Insists that a white man, under the same circumstances, would have fongbt Thornburgh. COTTON CROPS. William B. Porwood, president of the chamber of commerce, in Liverpool, England was introduced on ohange in the city of Cin­ cinnati, Dec. 8, and made a short address in which he said he had made an extensive. tour of the Middle States, and though it was some­ what hazardous to estimate the cotton crop of this country, he was satisfied the increase this year would be between two and three thousand bales. He was glad to say it had been produced cheaper than usual and was being gathered, packed and shipped in much better order than ever before. He congratu­ lated the city on its prosperity, and ventured the opinion that the present good times would be enduring and that his country would soon be enjoying the same blessing. RAILROAD ACCIDENT. The Chicago, Alton & Denver pass­ enger and express, westbound, due at Chicago on the morning of Dec. 6, jumped tho track while running at a rapid rate, making a frTghtful wreck The anglne turned complete­ ly ver, rolling down a five-foot embankment 4 and is badly damaged. The baggage car ran on down the track. The express car was crushed against the engine, and five other ears were thrown off the track none, howev­ er, being overturned. Three coaches, including the sleeper, kept the track, and the express and baggage ears are almost totally demol­ ished. The engineer, Pick Mead was bruised, but not seriously. The fireman Harry Lam mar tha, was. terribly scalded, and his recovery is doubtful, the express messenger, Harry Brown, was seriously bruised and scalded. None of the passengers were injured. The cause of the accident wrs a broken rail at the •witch. EGYPT AND ABYSSINIA. Accounts from Egypt state the govern­ ment is actively completing preparations for a war with Abyssinia. The war office at Cairo and the harbor of Guez, where the troops are to embark, is very animated. If hostilities are resumed the Egyptian forces will be divided into two armies, offensive and defensive, the former to be composed of eight thousand men and the latter of twelve thousand. men. The offensive army will be directed on the Egyptian harbor of Arklko, near the capital of Abyssinia, and the defensive army will take up two entrenched positions, one at Gozun, near Rabal river, and the other at Baiiia, on Bender river, Abyssinia, leading from the north to the Soudan. Gordan Pasha|will com­ mand the defensive army. REV. DE WITT TFALMADGE. On Bund&y, Dec. 7, Rev. Mr. Talmadge In the Brooklyn, N.

The Titusville, Pa., Herald has pub­ lished a post mortem statement of Andrew Tracy, the young lawyer who was hung at Smlthport, McKee county, Pa., for the murder of his cousin,.Miss Mary B. Reilly, In Sept 1878. The account makes* four columns in the Herald, and is written in remarkably well chosen and chaste language, and in itself is inteiesting. It was prepared during the lat­ ter months of Tracy's Incarceration at a great expenditure of time and labor, and perhaps few posthumous statements have ever ap­ peared in more highly attractive form. Tracy claims that the deed was not murder, but was instigated by his intense love for Miss Reilly, whom he says he could not bear to think of marrying another. Their love, It seems, was mutual, but her objections to their marriage was their near blood relationship. He pays a beautiful tribute to her memory. The case is one that created the most intense interest throughout Pennsylvania and western New York. LABOR AND CAPITAL. Senator Hoar introduced into the Sen­ ate Dec. 8 a bill to establish a labor commit­ tee. It provides that the President, with the consent of the Senate, shall appoint a com­ mittee of five persons to inquire and report as to the extent to wlitch machinery and labor saving process have entered into the produc­ tion and distribution of products in general and consumption among the people, to the displacementfof manual labor1 Also whether any causes are in operation to bring about the ownership and cultivation of lands in large tracts instead of small farms and homsteads. Also as to the condition of persons employed in agricultural, mechanical, manufacturing and mining lab$r in this country, and cspeci ally whether any causes are at work to change for the better or worse the condition of such persons, their hours of labor, the education of their children and the proportion received by them of the profits of the occupations in which they are engaged. The commissioners are to hold office for two years, receive an an­ nual salary of $4,000 each and be allowed ex­ penses of travel, have authority to employ a secretary and three clerks, and report to Con­ gress annually through the secretary of the interior. 

DEATH OF A CONGRESSMAN. Congressman Lay, of Missouri, died in Washington on the morning of Dee. 8th He had been in feeble health for »onie time. The immediate cause of his death was paraly­ sis. Alf.ed Morrison Lay, of Jefferson City was born ill Lewis county Missouri, May 20 1830. In 1842 he moved with his pareuts to Benton county. Missouri. He waj educated at private schools in Missouri and Bethany college, Virginia, from whence he graduated in 1856. He studied law in the office of the attorney general of the State at Jeffersou City, and was admitted to the bar in 1857. He was appointed United States attorney for the west cm district of Missouri by President Buchan­ an resigned in 1851 enlisted as a private in General John B.

Under­ wood, Republican, and James Boyd, Green backer. ENGLISH MARKETS. The Mark Lane Express says in soveral districts the autumn sowing is not completed and farmers must wait, for the time has now arrived when the weather consideration exer­ cises little influence on the grain trade. Wheat at country markets was pressed forward by farmers who are anxious to realize, but its condition was not improved. Its bad condi tion also greatly restricted business in Mark Lane and but few parcels fit for milling were sold at unreduced rates. The foreign arrivals were again swelled by much Russian, and business was naturally depressed thereby, but the general situation is unchanged, dullness being the usual characteristic of the close of the year. Sales have been quite of a retail char­ acter, with little If any change in prices, and holders have shown no desire to press sales. A few weaker speculators have began to evince a desire to realize, but merchants generally are still confident, with the cessation of Rus­ sian supplies and the diminution of Ameri­ can in consequence of the closing of the canals and increased demands for British for winter consumption, the future should furnish few grounds for much anxiety. The arrivals at ports of call have been email Wheat is in steady demand, and closed firm There was an improved demand for maize which advanced three pence per quarter. There was only a moderate business done In wheat for shipment in consequence of the high prices asked. Maize quiet. Barley in limited request at previous quotations Sales of English wheat last week, 38,580 quar­ ters at 46s, 7 per quarter, against 51,324 quar ters at 41c, 3 per quarter, for the same week last year.

NATIONAL NOTES. BBIDGE OR TUNNEL. BXPOBT OF THE DETROIT BTVKB COMMISSION. WASHINGTON, Deo. 8.—In their report to Gen­ eral Sherman the board appointed to report as to the advisability of a bridge or tnnnel at De­ troit, Mich., to accommodate the commerce nt that point, mention the fact that they were di­ rected by Gen. Sherman to inquire into and report whether for railroad purposes the Detroit river can be bridged or tunnelled at Detroit, or whether one mile above or below s!tid city in snoh a manner as to accommodate the large trade and commerce crossing the river at that point, and without material injory to the nav­ igation of said river, good and sufficient tugs being always kept by bridge-owners to assist any craft when required. They convened at De­ troit the first Thursday of Oct. 1879, and were required by Gen. Sherman to complete and submit their report and recommendations to the chief of engineers before December 1. The first five days of the session were occupied in hearing statements and arguments of persons favoring or opposing the construction of a bridge or tunnel^ and then, at the urgent re­ quest of all parties interested, the board ad­ journed to enable them to collect statistics bearing upon the subiect. On the 18th of No­ vember they reassembled and proceeded to consider the matters referred to them. The difficulties that they met with at tbe start is tbns briefly stated. At Detroit two immense streams of commerce came into direct interference, namely, one by water and the other by railroad. The problem before the board was to so ar­ range by either a bridge or tnnnel that these might cross each other with the least injury to both and in such a manner as to accommodate railroad traffic and at the same time do no ma­ terial or undue injury to the interests of navi­ gation. The magnitude of these conflicting interests at this point may be realized from the official statements marked in tbe report, which show that the number of vessels of va­ rious kinds passing Fort Gratiot light house during the fiscal year ending June SO, 1877, was 22,159, and that the business of the railroads crossing the river at Detroit during the year was as follows: 128,113 passengers, 12,758 pas­ senger cars, 3,873 baggage cars, and 104,359 freight cars. The report of the board of engineers ap­ pointed in 1873 to investigate this same sub­ ject, is alluded to: This former board stated, among other things, that no. bridge with draws should be tolerated. The board, in their con­ clusions on this point, say: There is proba­ bly no difference of opinion about these con­ clusions except aB to one, referring to abridge with draws. The form of the bridge consider­ ed inadmissable by the former board had open­ ings of 166 feet on each side, the remainder to be built upon piers of masonry 200 feet apart, and it was believed that draw openings of 166 feet were the greatest then considered practicable. Draws of more than 200 feet have been since constructed and it is now pro­ posed by bridge builders of high reputation to construct them with openings of 300 feet on each side of a pier, or of 400 feet between the two piers. The board, thongh unanimously of the opinion that a tunnel offers the moat com­ plete solution of the problem, presented no ar­ gument in favor of it. LABOR AND CAPITAL. WASHINGTON, DCC. 8.—Senator Hoar intro­ duced a bill in the Senate, o-day, to establish a labor committeo. It provides that tbe President, with the consent of the Senate, shall appoint a committee of five persons to inquire and re­ port as to the extent to which machinery and labor saving processes have entered into the production and distribution of products in general and consumption among the people, to the displacement of manual labor. Also, whether any causes are in operation to bring about tbe ownership and cultivation of lands in large tracts instead of small farms and homesteads. Also, as to the con' dition of persons employed in agricultural, mechanical, manufacturing and mining labor in this country, and especially whether any causes are at work to change for the better or worse the condition of such persons, their hours ot labor, tbe education of their children and the proportion received by them of the profits of the occupations in which they are engaged. The commissioners are to hold office for two years, receive an annnal salary of $4,000 each and be allowed expensss of travel, have authority to employ a secretary and three clerks, and report to Congress annually through the secretary of the interior. 

YELLOW FEVER. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—The commission ap­ pointed by the President to proceed to Cuba for the purpose of collecting information in re­ lation to yellow fever, has submitted a prelim­ inary report to tbe national board of heal lb. Tbe report says the most general result is that yellow fever prevails in every place in Cuba from which reports were received provided these places are of any size or commercial im­ portance, and contain any considerable number uf unacclimated persons, who fur­ nish food for widespread poison. In this particular the medical authorities as well as intelligent residents of Gnba, have for most the part misled the profession. Be­ fore leaving the United States most absolute assurances were given by natives or ex-residents of Cuba, and even in Cnba itself these assur­ ances were confidently repeated, that yellow fever never occurred in this, that or the other place. Diligent inquiry was made for all such places and diligent investigation invariably proved that these assurances were false, and that they were found­ ed upon comparatively slight prevalence of disease due in large measure to a small number of nnacolimated visitors or residents in such places, detailed reports of these facts are possessed in abundance, it is' very certain that prevalence of yellow fever is not equally marked in all places, this varies greatly in dif­ ferent places and in different years at some places and this variation is at times indepen­ dent apparently of amonnt of unacclimated material. INTERNAL COMMERCE. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—Joseph Kimmo, Jr., chief of the burean of statistics, has just Rent to the President a report on the international commerce of tbe United States, in the prepara­ tion of which he has been engaged for more than a year. This report embodies the resnlts of extensive investigations of commeicial and transportation affairs in various parts of the country. The following is a synopsis of the report: The growth of traffic on railroads i9 indicated by the fact that the total freight movements of three of the most important trunk lines connecting the West with tbe sea­ board increased from 10,898,989 tons in 1868 to 25,272,755 tons in 1878. The average cost of transportation on ten of the principal lines of the country fell from 2 3-10 cents per ton per mile in 1868, to 95-100 cent per mile in 1878. Seven-eighths of the surplus produc­ tions of the trans-Mississippi, north of the State of Arkansas, now cross the Mississippi on railroads at and between St. Louis and St. Paul, and are transported directly east to the markets in the country and in foreign coun­ tries. During the year 1878 the eastward shipments from St. Louis by rail exceeded the Southern shipments from that city by the Mississippi river. The cities of St. Louis and New Orleans Were formerly closely identified in all their trade interests, bnt they are now sharply at rivalry withre spest to the trade of southern Mississippi, Ar­ kansas, northern Louisiana and a large portion of the trade of Texas. The four principal East and West trunk lines leading from the Atlantic seaboard, with their western connections to Chicago, St. Lonis, Lonisville and Cincinnati now constitute the most important avenues of commerce in this country, and the trade current which pass over them largely influences the course of our for­ eign trade with respect to the ports at which foreign goods are imported and domestic pro­ duct* are exported This great east and west current of trade has led to a radical ohange in the course of trade of States situated south of the Ohio river and south of the Siate'of Missouri. he cities of St. Louis, Louisville and Cincinnati now con­ trol at least two-thirds of the trade of these States in general merchandise, and have there­ fore become their chief commercial entreport for this trade. These cities compete actively with Mobile, New Orleana. and Galveston. In the aggregate, St. Louis, Louisville, and Cincinnati greatly surpass Mobile, New Orleans and Galveston in population, in the magnitude of their commerce and in other ele­ ments of commercial power. In competition for the trade of the States referred to, the three interior cities possess an important ad­ vantage in their rapidly developing manufac­ turing icdustriem, the value of the products of which during the year 1878 is estimated at fonr hundred and eighteen millions, or nearly aa much as the total value of imparts into the United States Iron foreign countries. With respect to such manufactures, these cities naturally exercise a much larger degree of control over the Southern trade, than with respect to their inerely distributive comnvroe. The cities of St. Louis, Louisville and Cincinnati now draw their supplies of domeatio merchandise •prin'eipally from the' Atlantio seaports of JBoaton, New York, Philadelphia and Balti more, and from manufactories in the New JbclaadStatea and in the Middle and Western 8tatee. lmported cooda »dld *t these three of the west aw chi«8y rsesived from or Atlantio seaports whste they arotraaa ot Cincinnati will probably greatly enlarge her southern trade as aceaoltof the recent oom pie tion of the Oin, ciBMtt-Soathern railway to Ohattanoga, Tenn. at which point it connects with the railroad of the Atlantic and Gulf States. There has been a rapid growth in the ship­ ment of cotton from the cotton growing States, through St, Lonis, Louisville and Cin­ cinnati and thenoe over east and west trunk lines at Atlantic seaports' and to manufactur­ ers in the New England States and other States of the Atlantio seaboard. These facts indi­ cate an important diversion in the course of trade of the southern States. GENERIX CAPITAL NEWS. PBKSIDEKTIAL NOMINATIONS. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—The President nomi­ nated Owen N.

The House committee on postoffice and post roads this morning instructed the chairman to: report the resolution introduced by 'Repre­ sentative Yalentine, calling on the {ftstmaster general for information why mails are not car­ ried on new railroad lines constructed in the West during the summer, and why service on routes now established is not incieased in ac­ cordance with the necessities of the people. A communication was received from the law clerk of the postoffice department, accompanied bv the rough draft of a bill embodying the views of the department upon the lottery ques­ tion. The bill introduced at the last session by Representative Morey, which provides that, in order to facilitate the delivery of letters and a speedy return to tho writers thereof of such as are refused or cannot be delivered, the post­ master general is hereby authorized and em­ powered to establish such postoffices or return letter offices as he may deem necessary, was ordered reported with an amendment making it mandatory on the postmaster general to es­ tablish certain return offices. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. The sub-committee of the House committee on agriculture this forenoon took up the bill relating to the agricultural department. A some­ what animated discussion developed a wide difference upon some features. The ways and means committee favored some legislation to, enlarge the ssope of the department. A prop­ osition to make the commissioner a cabinet of­ ficer is not likely to be determined ou the bill reported till after the holidays. TRADE MARES. The sub-committee of the House committee on manufactures disoussed without action the joint resolution introduced last Tuesday by Representative McCord, which proposes an amendment to the constitution of the United States, giving Congress power to grant, protect and regulate the exclusive right to adopt and use trade marks. Tbe secretary of war transmitted to the Sen­ ate to-day the report of the board of engineer officers relating to a bridge across the Detroit river at Detroit. The board aro unanimously of the opinion that the most complete solution of the problem is the construction of a tunnel under the Detroit river. They, however, en durse the bridge plan conditionally, conclud­ ing there will be no material difficulty in ves­ sels passing through draws of 300 or 400 feet in width at any time when it would be safe to navigate the river, and that if the right of way is clearly and emphatically given to naviga­ tion, there could be no material or undue in­ jury to that interest.

Such was the rude condition of the arts in the neighborhood at that time that his first initiation into art was as simple as that of Giotto. At 9 years of age he drew hairs from" a cat's tail, and made himself a brush. Colors he obtained by grinding oharcoal and chalk, and crushing the red blood out from the blackberry. His mother's laundry fur­ nished him with indigo, and the friend­ ly Indiana who nam a to his father's house gave him of the red and yellow earths with which they daubed their faces. With such rude materials the lad painted a child sleeping .in its cradle, and in that first effort, of pre­ cocious genius executed certain touches which he neveir surpassed, as he af­ firmed long after, when at the zenith of his remarkable career. How. from such primitive efforts, the Quaker youth .gradually worked into fame, went tp Italy mil' acquired posi­ tion there, and then ,settled in England, became thp favored protege of the Sing for forty years, and the President of the National Acad­ emy of Great Britain—theise are all matters of history, and, as-West never forgot his love for his native land, entitle him to the respectful re­ membrance. not only of artists) but of all his countrymen. American art lias every reason, also, to cherish his me ory with profound gratitude, for no painter ever conducted himself with greater kindness and generosity to the rising, struggling artists of his native land. No sooner did^ our early paint­ ers reach London than they resorted for aid or guidance io West and found in him a friend who lent them his powerful influence without grudging, or allowed them to set up their easels in his studio and gate them all the in­ struction in his power. Trumbull, Stuart, Dunlap, and many others, long after they had forgotten the i^atural foibles of West, had reason to remem­ ber bow great had been the services ho had rendered to the aspiring artists of his transatlantic home. Benjamin West appears to have been born with great natural ptfwers, which matured rapidly, and early ceased to develop in excellence proportioned to his extraordinary industry and fidel­ ity to his art. But, while a general evenness of quality rather than striking excellence in any particular works was the charac teristic of tho art of Wesb, together with a certain brick-red tone in his colors, not always agreeable, yet a share of genius must be granted-to the artist who painted "The Departure of Begu lus," "Death on the Pale Horse," and "The Death of Wolfe." It unquestion­ ably implied daring and consciousness of power to. brave the opposition of contemporary opinion and abandon classic costume in historical composi­ tions. In tViia innovation he won to his side the judgirient of Sir Joshua Beynolds and effected a revolution in certain phases of art. Notwithstanding this, however, 'West was emphatically a man of his time, molded by it rather than forming it, and inclined to con­ ventionalism when he entered the arena, art was in a depressed condition both in Italy, where he studied, and in England. When Beynolds and Gains­ borough .gave a fresh impulse to art, West's genius had already matured, and was incapable of making further prog ress.—S. O. W.Benjamin, in Harper's Magazine. "Cutting Out" on a Colorado Cattle Ranch. Only the first purpose of the "round up" has been observed when the cattle are collected. Next the cows and calves must be "cut out," and we sawthe "cow­ boys" ride into the herd, single out the cow (with calf following), and with great skill extricate her from the throng. The young calves are, of course, not yet marked, but the pres­ ence of one with a cow makes it impera­ tive to place the cow's mark on it. Strayed calves, oh the other hand (called "Mauvrics" from an old French­ man in Texas who is said to have added largely to his worldly store by a system­ atic abstraction .of these waifs and strays), are Bold for the benefit of the associated ranchmen. First catch your calf," as Mrs. Glass would say. Perhaps you may think that this is an easy task, but you would find, if you tried it, that you were never more mis­ taken in your life, for the ease with which the rancheros accomplish it has only come with careful training and long practice. The little animal runs wonderfully fast, springs, turns and dodges almost like a flash but the cow­ boy never takes his eyes off of him, and the trained horse, now well warmed up and entering fully into the spirit of the chase, responds to, almost seems to an­ ticipate, eveiy turn of his rider's left hand and wrist. Meanwhile the latter with his Tight arm is swinging his noosed rope, or 'lasso, and in another moment he has thrown it exactly over the calfs head. Instantly the horse plunges forward, giving "slack" to the rope, and allowing it to be wound around the horn of the saddle then he moves on, dragging the calf after him, and the little creature is soon in the hands of the men with the branding irons. These have been heated in a hot fire, and are quickly applied, and in a few minutes the calf, now indelibly des­ ignated as the property of Ids master, is again running about.—A. A. Hayes, Jr., in Harper's Magazine. Improving Opportunities. Tho old proverb Where there's a will there's a way/' finds full illustra­ tion in the life of' many eminent Amer­ icans. Such men as Henry Olay, Abra­ ham Lincoln and many others have risen from very humble station to intel­ lectual greatness by a resolute purpose to surmount difficulties. One well ac­ quainted with the early life of ex-Gov. George 8 BoutWell, Of Massachusetts, Secretary of the Treasury under Gen Grant, gives an interesting sketch of his early years: He had little education in the schools, being obliged to support himself from the age of 13. While a clerk*at Groton he found in the second story of the store an old but choice library. This was a mine of wealth to the boy. He read during the day. When there were no customers. But at 9, when the store closed, he retired to the library and read till drowsiness came on. Then he took a little physical exercise to rouse himself. When he felt sleepy again he plunged his head into a pail of water and, under this new stimulus, was able to stndy till a late hour. In tliia \^ay he acquired valuable knowledge and discipline, and prepared himself for a successful career. Self-educated men prize the opportunities which young men trained'in'the schools often throw away. The Language of Postage Stamps. It seems that postage stamps as well as flowers have a language. Thus, ac­ cording to the Albany Times, when a postage'stamp has been placed uoside clown on the left comer of the letter, it means, "I lore you in the same, crosswise, My heart is another's straight up and down, "Good-by, sweet­ heart, good-by upside down in the right-hand corner, "Write no more in tiie center, at the top, "Yes oppo­ site, at the bottom, "No on the right hand corner, at aright angle, ""Do you love me?"

BY LAWSON COOKE. In the fall of 1870, after the comple­ tion of the Kansas Pacifio railroad to Denver, I concluded to have one win­ ter's hunting on the plains. In pursu­ ance of this object I went from Park6 Fort (now Trego), a small station situ­ ated about half-way betw^n Kansas City and Denver. The fort was.named after Tom Parks, a railroad contractor on the Kansas Pacific, who was killed by Indians near this place. I was well acquainted with him, and helped to lay him out after his body was recovered. If I recollect correctly, I counted sev­ enteen arrow, spear, gunshot, and tom­ ahawk wounds he had received. He was not scalped, and killed eight In­ dians before succumbing. One cart­ ridge was still left in Ins Winchester rifle. At the time of which I am writing the plains were a vast feeding-ground for countless herds of buffalo but of late years they have almost entirely disappeared. On reaching Parks Fort I formed the acquaintance of a young Ohioan named Leonard. As he had just arrived, having come on a hunting expedition like myself, we struck up a partnership, and concluded to hunt to­ gether. My tenderfoot friend had brought a.Bmall armory from the States with him. A Winchester rifle, a needle gun, a bowie-knife, three different sized revolvers, and a big box of assort­ ed cartridges, composed a portion of his warlike accouterments. After arrang­ ing a programme for the winter's cam­ paign, we bought a horse each, and a cart and harness, together with a stock of provisions. Finally, everything be­ ing in readiness, we hitched up our horses, tandem fashion, and struck out almost due north. The first night we made Brush creek, and camped. As it was yet dusk, we shouldered our rifles, and strolled down the creek in search of game. After traveling half a mile we reached a grove of trees taller than the surrounding ones. Each tree contained one or more of what appeared to be the nests of some gigantic bird. Curious to ascertain what kind of nests the} were, I climbed up one of them, and found it w»s composed mostly of bark, and in the inside, wrapped in an old blanket, was a small skeleton. We had run across fan old .Indian burying ground. It is still the fashion with some tribes of Indians to bury theii dead in trees. Next morning we harnessed up our novel team, and in the course of an hour reached Solomon river. The stream is broad and shallow, and its banks are devoid of timber. Toward evening we arrived at Prairie Dog creek, fifty miles from Parks Fort. As there was con siderable game in the neighborhood, and plenty of wood and water, we con­ cluded to make this our camping ground. For two or three days we were busily engaged in building a residence —a kind of roofed cellar. We killed a few buffalo, and used their hides for shingles. We had barely become com­ fortably settled before we discovered a better-looking camping-place, about three miles distant. So we vacated our first house, and commenced building a log-house. This we loopholed banked up with dirt, and roofed as before. Busi ness now commenced. Whenever we killed a few buffalo, we cut off the hams, took out the humps and tongues, and hauled them to camp. These were cut up, salted in brine, and finally smoked and dried. The balance of the carcass was slit here and there, and strychnine placed in the cuts. This was intended to accommodate the wolves and coyotes. Our baits were looked after every morning, and occasionally we had from one to six wolves. After a few weeks, game becoming scarce, we took a trip over to Sappa creek, seven miles north, with the in­ tention of staying there a few days. The first day of our arrival we killed seventeen buffalo, and, as usual, pois­ oned the remains. The -following morning we found twenty dead wolves and coyotes. By the time we had them all skinned and pegged out it was time for supper. As I was gathering up sticks with the intention of starting a fire, my partner called my attention to some fellow on horseback coming over the divide from the BepuMican river. Just as he got within plain view, anoth­ er and another followed, until finally we counted eight of what proved to be Indians. They came down the creek and went into camp about half a mile down the stream from us. As discre­ tion was the better part of valor, we built no fire, and, consequently, went supperless to bed. I don't think either of us slept much. At the first gleam of daylight we saddled up and made a hasty retreat back to our castle. We never returned for our wolf-pelts and whether our red brethren appropriated the spoils or no, deponent sayeth not. Buffalo, antelope, black-tail deer, beaver, otter, wild turkey and jack-rab­ bits were abundant. On one occasion, there being a little snow on the ground, we found the tracks of a band of deer, which we followed. They had crossed and recrossed the frozen creek several times, and, in making one trip over the ice, it proved treacherous, and in I went. As the day was intensely cold, my compulsory bath was rather uncom­ fortable, and, although I made good time to our cabin, I found both my feet were badly frozen. This accident ren­ dered me somewhat of a cripple, and confined me in doors for several days. In the course of a week, the confine­ ment proving irksome, and my partner reporting fresh deer-tracks, I wrapped my feet in gunny-sacks and we sallied forth. As the creek-banks were lined with willows, he took one side, I the other. Before going far I espied an old bull-buffalo, evidently taking a kindly interest in my maneuvers. Al­ though he was nearly 400 yards away, I fired, and he fell. In going toward him I slipped another cartridge into my rifle. When within abont five yards I noticed he was a pretty lively-looking corpse, but, ere I had time to ruminate, he up and charged. Instinctively 1 pointed the rifle at his head and fired. The old fellow merely shook his crani­ um, but delayed not. I dropped my rifle then commenced one of the most interesting races ever beheld.' I was a little ahead, with the bull a good sec­ ond. After retaining my slight lead for about seventy-five yards I heard my partner, on the opposite side of. the creek, yelling with laughter and halloo* ing, "Go it, Cook—go it I" Previous to receiving this encouragement 1 had been doing my utmost to beat the buf­ falo. Presently my partner's rifle cracked, and, glancing over my shoul­ der, I saw my antagonist was down, having evidently withdrawn from tho contest The moment I felt I was safe I began hobbling toward my partner, but he at once objected to my mode of locomotion, daimrng it to be an utter impossibility for frerippleio make such good tmw I had reoantly done.. He ever afterwardinsistedthot^with alittle training, I woold be the fleetest foot man^n thejplains.-v On a&other pocsrion Jjconard wonnd edayuvagtalVirfiichleisa^fywiriked into the stream and lay down. As we were anxioncT to haveT him on dry ground, I was to poke him with a stick, and, when he charged me, my partner was to shoot him down. After a good deal of punching, the animal came out to interview me. Unfortunately, after he got on terra firma, Leonard's rifle missed fire, and I had another foot-race.. We, however, only raced about fifty yards, when the buffalo, apparently stricken with remorse, withdrew from the contest, and returned to the stream The next time I coaxed him out a sure shot laid him low. About once in two weeks we loaded up our cart with an assortment of game, which I used to haul to the sta­ tion and exchange for necessaries we required. This trip of 100 miles all alone, right through a hostile Indian country, was not a pleasant one. There was no trail, and, as the plains are of a very monotonous appearance, it was a difficult matter to keep the right course. I generally managed to make Brush creek the first night, and, after preparing supper, no matter how cold it might be, I had to put out the fire, as I was afraid it might attract the at­ tention of neighboring Indians. On one of my excursions, when I reached Brush creek the night was intensely cold, and I thought, Indians or no In­ dians, I'll keep afire this night. My blankets were stretched near the fire, and I was dozing (sound sleep was out of the question), when I heard a crack­ ling among the twigs and dry leaves. On looking around, about ten feet dis­ tant I saw a pair of shining eyes glar­ ing right at me. My first impression was that it was an Indian crawling on his hands and knees, and I acknowl­ edge a feeling of fear. On reaching for my rifle, I began to think it might possibly be only a wolf, and, if so, it was dangerous to fire off a gun at that time of night, not knowing who my •neighbors might be, or their where­ abouts. Finally, becoming satisfied it was a wolf, I drew a brand from the fire and threw it at the two eyes. With a snort and a rush, my visitor unceremo­ niously left me. I have read accounts of buffalo bel­ lowing and pawing the ground before making a charge but I never heard fiie even moan, and they do not even lose any time in pawing. I never heard of them attacking a man, unless badly wounded. Until a bull is 2 years old, his horns stand up erect, and he is then called a spike-bull. After that his horn# commence curving toward each other. The old patriarch bulls, who have outlived their usefulness, are run out of the harem and rove around dis­ consolate, either singly or in herds. Buffalo sometimes exhibit astonishi'i^ tenacity of life. I have known thciu get clean away with probably a pound of lead in them. Occasionally the first shot will kill one too dead to skin.'' The most noisy animal on the pJain.? is the coyote. When about three them congregate at dusk and begin warbling their evening hymn, instead of a trio you would .imagine it was a grand chorus in which 500 voices par­ ticipated. The music produced is about as melodious as what we are ac­ customed to hear rendered by that back­ ward artist, the Thomas cat. The coy ote, although not endowed with superior musical abilities to the feline, has greater compass of voice. As his song is not productive of sleep, I have often wished to conclude his serenade by gently caressing him with a club. During stormy weather we had ample time to cut up and salt what meat we had on hand. Although the winter passed pleasantly, it was a Robinson Crusoe kind of existence. On Christ­ mas day our big camp-kettle contained the breasts of three or four turkeys, a jack-rabbit, small pieces of deer and antelope, and a portion of buffalo hump. I doubt whether there was a family on the continent which had such a variegated bill of fare. My partner, who had a weakness for eccen­ tric costume, during the winter made himself a cap from a badger's skin, a vest from beaver pelts, and a pair of pants from the hide of a buffalo calf. He also seriously contemplated the manufacture of a coat from wolf-skins. Buffalo-hunting is hard work, but there is so much excitement attached to it that the hunter does not ieel tired un­ til his day's work is done and he finds himself five or six miles, away from camp. Toward spring wo divided our spoils and I returned to Denver. I never saw or heard of my partner since. The Songs of Scotland. There is a very general impression, especially in England, that Burns cre­ ated Scottish song, and that all that is valuable in it is his work. Instead of saying that Burns created Scottish soug, it would.be more true to say Scot tish song created Burns, and that in him it culminated. He was born at a happy hour for a national songster, with a great background of song centuries old behind him, and breathing from his childhood a very atmosphere of melody. From the earliest times tbe Scotch have been a song-loving people, meaning by song both the tunes, or airs, and words. This is not the side which the Scotch­ man turns to the world, when he goes abroad into it to push his fortune. We all know the character that passes cur­ rent as that of the typical Scot—sandy haired, hard-featured, clannish to his countrymen, shrewd, cautious, self seeking, self-reliant, persevering, un­ sympathetic to strangers, difficult to drive a bargain with, impossible to cir­ cumvent. The last thing a stranger would credit him with would be the love of song. Yet when that hard, cal­ culating trader has retired from the 'change or the market-place to his own fireside, perhaps the things he loves best, almost as much as his dividends, will be those simple national melodiec he has known from his childhood. Till a very recent time the whole air of Scot­ land, among the country people, was re­ dolent of song. Ton heard the milk­ maid singing some old chant, as she milked the cows in field or byre tho housewife went about her work," or span at her wheel, with a hit upon her lips. In the Highland glen you might hear some solitary reaper singing like her whom Wordsworth has immortalized in the lowland harvest field, now one, now another, of the reapers taking up an old world melody, and then the whole band breaking out into some well-known chorus. The plowman, too, in winter, as he turned over the lea furrows, be­ guiled the time by humming or whist­ ling a tune even the weaver, as he clashed his Bhuttle between the threads, mellowed the harsh sound with a song. In former days song was the great amusement of the peasantry, as they of a winter night met for a hamlet-gather­ ing by each other's firesides. This was the usage in Scotland for centuries, and I am not sure that the radical newspaper which has superseded it is an improve­ ment.—Atlantic. A Printer's Error. Printers, or rather compositors, poor fellows! are only men, and subject to blunder-making as all their kind are. But they aro seldom so guilty as are the writers whose manuscripts they put in type, although they bear double blame because of the oftentimes wretched calig raphy imposed on them. A very curious "printer's error" happened to escape publication in Boston many years ago. It was at the height of the Congressional campaign whioh ended in the defeat of Anson Burlingame. He had made a speech in Music Hall, but -hundreds were unable to get in to hear him. On leaving the hall, in company with Gen. Henry Wilson, shouts came from the crowd on the street for A speech I A speech from Burlingame 1" Standing on the sidewalk, Anson made a neat lit­ tle address, during which he apostro­ phized the monument on the other side of Charles river, as thai tall gray shaft on Bunker's height."

More is the pity that little Pinkie should be introduced to you with her yellow hair dangling like tangled cob­ webs over her small pug nose, her blue dress all torn and spotted, her hands as black as a chimney-sweep's and a card, moreover, pinned on her back with "Untidy" printed in very large letters upon it. The card was really almost worn out with long usage. Aunt Ziph brought it out almost every day and hung it round gentle, careless little Pinkie's neck. Every night, tired, disheveled Pinkie determined henceforth to be neat, and sighed out at the end of her evening prayer, "Please, I would Jike to be a very tidy little girl after this." But somehow, when the day-time came, it did not seem to her to be so very naughty to be "onneat." Pinkie was sitting in the window on a pile of nice fluted aprons and collars which Aunt Ziph had told her to put away in her bureau. She leaned her little grimy hands on the back of the chair, and, resting her chin on them, gazed through her disor­ dered curls at the little girl in the op­ posite house, who was rocking in a low chair and darning a small red stocking. While Pinkie is gazing, let us look around Pinkie's room. It seems to be moving-day with the dolls. Two tin express wagons are piled up with furniture before the open baby-house doors Then a gorgeous barouche full of dolls is upset on a heap of stoves and mirrors and china that seem to have been flung hastily out of the little baby house windows. The kitty has tossed over Pinkie's work-basket, and is friskily cuffing the tangled balls and spools. Pounce, the little dog, after chewing it Pinkie's boots and shaking her "reader" to tatters, is fast asleep on the (ibbons and roses of Pinkie's new hat. Little Tufty, the canary, is chirping piteously for seeds and water, which Pinkie has forgotten to give him. The bed is all tossed about by Pounce the drawers and doors all standing open. Alas for little Pinkie I Now let us look into the other room across the way, where the little girl sits darning and rocking. The ivies in the window are dancing in the morning sunshine, made very hap­ py by the good breakfa&t and nice, clean bath which Plum, the busy little darner, has just given them. The baby-house is all in nice order, and locked up fast and tight with the dollies lying comfortably in bed, their night-caps tied squarely under their chins, and their eyes wide open. They are not to get up all day, be­ cause little Plum has so much to do she cannot properly attend to them. Yes, little Plum has certainly a great deal to do. After the stockings are mended, there is little baby brother to be drawn round the garden in his new car­ riage, and when the baby brother pleases to go to sleep there are all Plum's small handkerchiefs to be ironed. Yes, it is a very busy day, indeed, thinks Plum, darning briskly at the stocking-heel so very briskly that the small bnsy bee, filling his little pots of honey from the honey-Buckle jars just outside the window, hums with delight at such industry. Such a neat little room is Plum's, with all her small boots in a prim row in the shoe-bag, every chair in its place, and the smooth quilt white as snow. "Oh dear, I wish such proper little girls wouldn't go and move in opposite I" sighed Pinkie, as she wriggled about uneasily over the fluted aprons and col lars. "It's 'scouraging how Aunt Ziph will talk about her to me. Oh dear 1" "Pinkie 1" This severe voice was Aunt Ziph's, Aunt Ziph was standing at Pinkie's door dressed for a drive. She had come to take Pinkie with her. But Pinkie's appearance, and the appear ance of Pinkie's room, was unfavorable to such a plan. Aunt Ziph turned out Pounce and the kitten, pulled down the shades, and ordered Pinkie into bed. Pinkie, sob bing under the quilts, heard the car­ riage drive off toward the green hills and grassy roadsides. Poor Pinkie! I am serry to have such a tale to tell of her, but such sad things do happen to untidy little girls. —Elsie Oorham, in Youth's Com, panion. Willie and JSva.

Many a scowl settled on his bonny brow, and many a harsh word fell from his pouting lips. Full oft did his sister Eva receive a blow from his hand, which brought the tears into her gentle eyes. One day Willie and she were playing in the garden, and Willie, having caught a butterfly, was impaling it on a sharp pin, when his sister remonstrated, and told him it was very cruel but Willie only laughed. Then Eva tried to res­ cue the poor insect, and Willie, in passion, struck her with his little clenched fist and cut her lips. Then she left him, and, crying bitterly, went into a summer-house and sobbed her elf to sleep. Then old Father Dromio came, and told her a story. He told her that once, in a far-away land, there lived a very fierce and cruel giant, who would torture those he caught, and sometimes even kill them, and that the people of that land became very much afraid of him, and the King offered a reward to any knight who should kill tho giant and rid the country of him. Very many brave and noble men tried but all were driven back either with hard words or hard blowB, or, after being tortured, were thrown back on the road and left to die. Mighty engines were made to destroy the giant, but they had no power over him wounds and blows he seemed to laugb at. At last a very young knight offered to try and rid them of the monster. Ho was laughed at by the people as a silly boy, and none cared to help him. In the night he set off alone to tho giant's castle. As he was going he met a fairy, who asked him his mission. "To slay the giant," was the reply. "Nay, thoa canst not do that," said the fairy "bnt if thoa wilt do as I tell thee, thou mayst, perchance, put him to flight, and eventually drive him away altogether." "Oh, tell mo how, kind fairy," ex­ claimed the young knight. "Throw aside thy sword and armor, and take in thy hand these sweet-scent­ ed lilies-of-the-valley, whose petals might vie withthe.snow in purity and, when he shall come forth with fury to crush thee, throw one of the flowers in his face, or at his breast, or in his path, and he will fallback and thus continue, making a throw for every thrust of his, and thou shalt surely oonquer." The fairy then placed the flowers in his hand, and then vanished. The young knight did as she com­ manded and what the giant came up xm him with age, he gently .threw a blossom in his path. The giant stumbled, then flushed/ and drew hack. Tbe kBighft followed him strew­ ing the ground around him with the fragrant flowers, until, at last, the giant flung down his arms, and fled. Eva awoke, and, thinking about her dream, asked her nurse what it meant. The nurse complied with the request, and explained as follows: "The giant's name is Bad Temper, which makes itself a terror and a sor­ row to all who are near. It is not to be conquered by hard words, nor blows, but by kindness and gentle answerings, which" blunt its sharp sword and break down its mighty strength. Little acts of kindness will soon put it to flight, as the sweet-scentod flowers did the giant in your dream. And now, Eva, go and play with Willie." Eva ran away to her brother, and little bird tells me that now Willie and Eva are never apart, and that they never quarrel. So much for a dream, little ones.
