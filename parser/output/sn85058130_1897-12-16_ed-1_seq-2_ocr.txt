Empress of India thus describe the taking of KiaoChau by I the Germans On Sunday morning Nov 1 three l German warships the Kaiser flagship with the admiral on board the Princess I Wilhelmina and the Arcona entered the bay and the admiral sent word to the general commanding the garrison that he had come to obtain satisfaction for the murder of the two German missionaries sionaries of Bishop Ansers Romar Catholic mission which took place on the 1st inst at Yengtu in the south east of the province and that he in tended landing a strong party of men I and occupying the forts The Chinese general in command sent back an eva I sive answer and tried to refer the mat ter to Pekin saying he had nothing to 140 with it The admiral returned a per emptory reply saying lie would land his men in three hours and would use force to carry out his orders giving the Chinese garrison that much time to I evacuate the forts I BADLY SCARED I The Chinese soldiery composed of the I usual coolie warriors were scared out of their wits when they saw the for eign devils ships make ominous prep I arations for business by running out their guns and lowering their yards while the boats swung out in readiness I for landing men The Chinese general sent word to the flagship that he yielded to superior I force and meekly bowed his head to the inevitable He begged to place his i j life and those of his wives and numer ous family under German protection i and was ready to obey the honored commands of the German admiral Then several hundred men with six guns were landed without the slightest opposition and in admirable order at three points each division marching to i the nearest fort which they found ten antless I The Chinese flags were promptly hauled down and the German ensign I run up whereupon the

KILLING FUR SEALS Mr Davis of the foreign relations committee called up the bill prohibit ing the killing of fur seals in the waters of the North Pacific ocean and pre sented letters from Secretaries Sherman of the state department and Gage of the treasury department favoring the I immediate passage of the proposed measure Mr Davis explained that the bill was in aid of furthering diplomatic negotiations After explaining the law at present I bearing upon the fur seal question Mr Davis pointed out that there was now no law prohibiting pelagic sealing and 1 that this shameful admission had to be i made by the representatives of the United States in the negotiations with I other countries looking to a suspen sion of such sealing 

SETTLE THE QUESTION Mr Pettigrew of South Dakota en I tered a sharp protest to the passage of I i I the bilL because it deprived Americans of privileges accorded to people of other countries He thought i was time for i the United States to definitely dispose II I of the question of killing all of the seals I Islands as they land upon the Pribyloff lands He thought that the United States had suffered enough humilia tion on account of the seal business and he believed that the proposed bill ought to be amended so that if Great I Britain did not by the first of June next agree to a suspension of pelagic I sealing this country would kill all seals male and female and thus settle the question once for all Mr Pettigrew then offered an amend ment to the bill in line with his re marks Mr Davis protested against the adoption of Mr Pettisrews amend ment He thought that because Great Britain did not come promptly to our terms it was not a sufficient reason for this country to enter upon an unexam I pled butchery of the beautiful and use ful animal He expressed the opinion I that the carrying into effect of Mr Pettigrews proposition would bring Pettgrews propositon I odium upon this country that would stain us forever EVIDENCE OF IMPOTENCE Mr Perkins of California thought the I adoption of the amendment would be I an evidence of impotence He would he I said be ashamed to see such a provi sion upon our statute books He be lieved i the duty of congress to pass the bill as presented by the committee and he was satisfied the negotiations pending would soon bring about an amicable and satisfactory settlement of the seal question Replying Mr Pettigrew expresseed the opinion that the adoption o the amendment would result in the preser vation of the seal herd He thought if yaton England would not enter into a mutual 1 agreement for the preservation of the i herd justice demanded that this coun I I try should kill the seals thus finally I disposing of them He thought it would I be no more inhuman and less trouble some to kill the entire 175000 than to kill the 20000 allowed I Mr Spooner of Wisconsin asked Mr Pettigrew if he believed that Great Britain as a selfrespectinc nation I would enter into any agreement if this government should meet it with such a II threat as that imnlied in his Petti grews amendment I Replying Mr Pettisrew said the United States had ben trying for four I years to secure an agreement with of the seals England for the protection I and had failed England refusing oven to enter upon the negotiations TIRED OF WAITING For one he continued I am tired of waiting upon England in this a in other matters I is humiliating that we should be compelled to do so not only in the fur seal but in the Cuban and financial questions hesitating to declare our independence because of Englands possible opposition The on ly interest England has in protecting the Spanish interest in Cuba is that implied in the fact that Lombard street holds the Spanish bonds This being the case we can do nothing for Cuba unless Great Britain is willing So it is in financial matters and thus it hap i pens that we must send a commission to fawn at the feet of the hookviosed Jews of London to ascertain whether they are willing that we should do thus and so in the matter of our own finances National pride and honor he said are opposed to further diplomatic nego tiations upon the seal question By the passage of the bill amended a he sug gested the fur seal industry in London would be aroused and bring to bear in fluences upon Great Britain which might effect a proper settlement of the question UNJUST LAW Mr White of California thought the passage of such a law as proposed would be unjust to our own people un less assuiances are given that similar legislation is to be enacted by other countries Canada in particular In the course of his brief remarks Mr White said it was evident that the foreign re lations committee was not so bellicose a it was a year ago but he hoped that I would not force the country into such legisltion as would yield any rights or pro is now enjoyed by American citi I zens to people of other countries BILL PASSED I Upon the resumption of consideration of the seal bill the amendment offered by Mr Pettigrew was defeated The bill was then passed by a vote of 37 to 14 14UNFASHIONABLE UNFASHIONABLE TALK By agreement the bill to provide for the twelfth and subsequent censuses was taken up to enable Mr Lodge of I Massachusetts to submit some re marks upon i Mr Lodge said he was aware that at the present time it was I i not fashionable to say anything in I j support of th civil service law but I that it was considered rather bad form j to attack the administration of the law He said that he had always been and I was now a friend of the civil service I law President Cleveland had at the close of his administration made an I enormous extension of the classified I service placing about 40000 persons i I without examination under its protec I tion Naturally such action so late in the last administration had put the I present administration under 0 great i strain but it is satisfactory to note I said Mr Lodge that President Mc I Kinley has bravely and courageously i d alt with the question at the begin ning of his administration instead of waiting until its conclusion a was the I practice of his predecessor 111 Lodge read extracts from a let I ter from the Hon Carroll D Wright chief of the labor bureau in which the expenses of conducting the census of I fice were discussed at length At the conclusion of Mr Lodges re marks Mr Carter of Montana chair man of the census committee outlined briefly the provisions of the proposed bill Mr Carter indicated the desira bility of providing for the appointment of the director of the census and his immediate aides as soon as practicable The measure he desired it understood was purely preliminary in character andmade no provisions for the great work of the census which would be I provided for in another measure to be presented later BAD 

SYSTEM Ill vote said Mr Chandler tp apply the civil service system to the clerical force of the government but I think that the system has been un warrantably extended and made to in clude persons who are not justly en titled to its protection Mr Carter closed the debate by an nouncing that he would press the measure to a vote as soon after the holiday recess as possible The senate then on motion of Mr Quay of Pennsylvania went into exec utive session and a few minutes after wards at 435 p m adjourned I NATINAl OARD Of TRADE TALK ON POSTAL SAVINGS A IRRIGATION Resolution Adopted Favoring Fed eral Control of Irrigation Enter prises I Certain Conditions Washington Dec 15The first matter which came before the Natlohal Board of Trade at its session today was D resolu tion favoring the establishment of postal savings banks which was introduced by the Chicago Board of Trade I was stated in the resolution that the people should be encouraged to deposit their savings in a department of the national government The Chicago bill was advocated by Mr Lyon of Chicago who said that the secret of saving lies in Its beginning Mr Hitch cock asked if Mr Lyon knew what the government would do with this money In reply Mr Lyoa said he had not given this phase of the subject attention Mr Hitchcock wantd to say that it seemed to him such a system partook of a pater nalism that was foreign to other institu tions and in addition to other objections which might bs enumerated he said it would interfere with the business of the savings banks Mr Hawley said the same system was in operation in England but he understood it was not profitable Another objection was that it would i concentrate money in the cities and would I interfere with the business of building associations etc The question was re ferred to a committee to resort at the I next meeting I IRRIGATION I The question of artificial irrigation was next discussed the basis being a resolu tion offered by the Pittsburg Chamber I of Commerce which recommended that congress enact laws to place the supar vision of all Irrigation enterprises in the I hands of the United States authorities where such work is undertaken upon I waterways aIe ting interstate navigation An address in cidvocacy of this resolution I was made by Mr Andrews of Pittsburg who said nearly onehalf of the area of this country was arid j He said i trtheW problem was to store the I flood water in a chain of artificial lakes I which would do away with the danger of Hoods and also would provide water for irrigation purposes A general discussion followed during which it was stated that this was one of the important questions now before the country and the entire Mississippi valley water supply would have to be studied The resolution was adopted and a committee appointed to have charge of matters and report at the next meeting ANTITRUST LAW DEFECTIVE ANTIrRUST The Philadelphia Grocers and Export ers exchange presented a resolution that in all cases wherein railroad lines tele graph lines telephone companies or great commercial strusts or combinations affect all the states the congress of the United States shall control them Mr Helpln said he had been told that the present antitrust law was defective and would either drive the maker of flour out of the business or drive him into ne farious business FOR

battle is expected McCoy is unquestionably the best I middleweight in America while Cree don is the best Australian now fighting in the neighborhood of 158 pounds Both men have many friends McCoys being slightly in the majority When the match was made three months ago many good judges were of the opinion that McCoy would enter the ring a 2 to 1 favorite and the fact that odds of only 10 to 8 are laid I against the Australians chances indi cates the high regard in which he is held by the wise ones UNLIKE IN STYLE Creedon and McCoy are as unlike in their style of fighting as two men could possibly be The Australian is short I and chunky while the American is tall and wiry Creedon is of the old school of boxing He fights on the hurricane order and depends more on the force I of his blows than science to win a fight He likes to fight at short range and his usual point of attack is his oppo I nents body He can hit a terrific blow and the Australians friends believe that I his ability to strike effectively will give him a victory over the Kid On the other hand McCoy likes to I fight at long range believing in jab bing his opponent and gradually wear ing him down He does not believe in taking any chances and is not near so j effective at infighting as he is at long I range rangeRESEMBLES I RESEMBLES CORBETT McCoys style of fighting resembles I Corbett The Kid is
