PRESIDENTS MESSAGE i HEARD IN CONGRESS i i ( Continued Prom Page 1.) t 1 in | ? a wardsin dividual nations. The law of { democracy in the world should be x ior, the. protection of the weak ria- t tion, the nation wjiich is struggling g towards its right and towards its proper recognition and privilege in the famujr ot nations. Can Sol Refuse. | The United States can not refuse j> this role of champion without put/ ting tfee stigma of rejection upon the ? k peat and devoted men who brought its government into existence and es- s tablis&ed it in the face of almost universal opposition and intrigue, even in the face of wanton forc4 as, for c example, against the orders in coun- i cil of Great Britain and the arbitrary t Napoleonic decrees which involved us ~ in what we know as the War of 1812. T I urge you to consider that the dis- ^ play of &n immediate disposition on z the part , of the congress to remedy y any injustices or evils that may have shtfwn themselves in our own na. . c tional life will afford the most effectual offset to the forces of chaos s and tyranny which are playing , so , diSaafrons a part in the fortunes of z the free peoples of more than one part of the world. The United States ?c M nA*v>R*itv the samDle democracy of the world, and the triumph of democracy depends upon its success. t Recovery from the disturbing and sometime*1 disastrous effects of the late war has been exceedingly slow on t$e other side of the water and has given promise, I venture to say, of early completion only in our own forttmate country; tut even with us the.recovery halts and is impeded at times and there axe immediately serviceable acts of legislation which, it seems to me; it ought to attempt/ j to assist that recovery and prove the < indestructible, recuperative force of ? a great government of the people. One of thes? is to prove that a great t democracy can keep house as Tuccessfully and in as businesslike a t fashion as any other government. It : seems to me that the first step j to- i wards proving this is to supply our- , selves with a systematic method of | handling oar estimates and expenditures and bringing them to the point where they will not be an unnecessary strain upon our ineome or necessitate unreasonable taxation; in other words, a workable budget system, and I respectfully suggest that two elements are essential to such a system;'namely, not only that the proposal of appropriations should be in the hands of a single body, such as t a single appropriations committee in ,?acfe home of the congress, but ako r that this body should be brought into ? * V?l~-V AL-tdkf'. .ii. i' ^ ' HRfi cooperation wno wie ucpaxi* 2 ments of thegovernment and -^jth j the treasury of the United States as would enable it to act upon a complete conspectus of the needs of the government and the resources from g irhicb it must drawits income. I re- j luctantly vetoed the budget bill s passed by the last session of the c congress, because of a constitutional j objection. The house of represents- n tives subsequently modified the bill in { order to meet this objection. In the f revised form I believe that ?5e bill, , coupled -wife action already taken by f the congress to revise its rules and j procedure, furnishes the foundations c for an effective national budget sys- c tern. I earnestly hope, therefore, g that one of the first steps taken by jthe present session of the congress t Will be to pass the budget bill. t Fbutnc0> Improve. The nation's finances have, shown a marked improvement during the past j year.

There has also j been a marked decrease in holding of t government war securities by the t banking Institutions of the country, t " - ' a .* l!ll_ 1 TJ as weir as us cue amount 01 Dm? nnu j l>y the federal reserve banks secured s by gwernment war obligations. This t fortunate result has relieved the e tanks s&A left them freer to financ r the needs of agriculture, industry s I- commerce, It ha? been due in \ large -part to the reduction of the } public debt, but more particularly to c " * A# wrtTTflm. i I the improved OlSbriOUUUll VI i ^ ttent securities among permanent in- e restore. The cessation of the govern- r mentis borrowings except through thort term certificates of indebtedness has been a matter of great con- t Sequence to the people of the coun- t try at large, as well as (to the holders 1 of Liberty bonds and Victory notes, s ' ? i ?i r' i- and has had an important neanng- on c the matter of effective credit control, t this year has been characterized by 11 the progressive withdrawal of the c treasury from the domestic credit z i > *'* :* v ffy ' narket and from a position of don: lant influence in that market. TJ 'uture course will necessarily deper ipon the extent to which economi tre practiced and upon the burdei )laced upon the treasury, as well ; lpon industrial developments ar he maintenance 0/ tax receipts at ufficiently high level. Many Notes (Soon Due. The fundamental fact which, >resent, dominates the government inancial situation is that seven ar t half billions of its war indebte less mature within the next two ar i half years. Of this amount, tv tnd a half billions are floating del md five billions Victory notes ar var savings certificates. The fisc urogram of the government must 1 letermined with reference to the: naturities. Sound policy deman< hat government expenditures be r luced to the lowest amount whi< vill permit the various services 1 perate efficiently and that gover: nent receipts from taxes and salvaf >e maintained sufficiently high >rovide for current requirements, i: ,'luding interest and sinking fui iharges on the public debt and at tl ;ame time retire the floating de' tnd part of the Victory loan befo: naturity. With rigid economy, vi: rous salvage operations and ad luate revenues from taxation, a su )lus of curernt receipts over curre: txpenditures can be realized ar (hould be applied to the floatir lebt. All branches of the gover nent should cooperate to see -th. his program is realized. I can not -over emphasize the ne sssity of economy in government a >ropriatrons and expenditures ai he avoidance by the congress < >ractices which take money from tl reasury by indefinite or revolvii 'und appropriations. The estimat 'or the present year show that ov< .1,000,000,000 of expenditures we: luthorized by tHe last congress iddition to the amounts shown in tl isual compiled statements of "appr >riations. This strikingly illustrate he importance of making direct ai pecific appropriations. The1 relatit +V?o mirranf and CU FUtvrq^u vub

It is obvious that the arge payments have already seriou y limited the government's progre n retiring the floating debt. vWrald Revise Tax Laws. Closely connected with this, eems to me, is the necessity for i mmediate consideration of the re's ion of our tax laws.

The ne< or their simplification, however, rery great, in order to save the ta *ayer inconvenience and expense ai n order to make his liability mo: ertain and definite. Other and mo: letailed recommendations with r ;ard to taxes will no doubt be la efore you by the secretary of tl reasury and the commissioner of ii ernal revenue. It is my privilege to draw to tl ttention of congress for very syc >athetic consideration the problem < ?roviding adequate facilities for tl are and treatment of former mer rers of the military and naval forci rho are sick of disabled as the r rait of their participation in the wa [ hese heroic men can never be pa n money for the service they pati i+i/iollw tVio nofinn TTlP n ion's gratitude must be effective evealed^to them by the most amp irovision for their medical care ar reatment as well as for their voc ional training and placement. T1 ime has 'come when a more comple irogram can be formulated and mo: satisfactorily administered for the reatment and trainnig, and I ear: tstly urge that the congress give .tl natter its early consideration. Tl secretary of the treasury and ytl joard of vocational training will on ine in their annual reports proposa :overing medical care and renaDint ion which I am sure will engage yoi tamest study and command yoi nost generous support. Agriculture Needs Help. Permit me to emphasize once mo: he need for action upon certain ma :ers upon which I dwelt at son ength in my message to the secoi lession of the 66th congress: the n lessity, for example, of encouragii lie manufacture of dyestuffs and x ated chemicals; the importance < ioing everything possible to promo igricultura! production along ec li- nomic lines, to improve agricultural le marketing and to make rural life id more attractive and healthful; the es need for a law regulating cold storis age in such a way as to limit the as time during which goods may -be id kept in storage, prescribing the o mofV?nH n-f disnosine- of them, if kent beyond the permitted period, and re' quiring goods released from'storage aj. in all cases to bear the date of their ,?s receipt. It would also be most ser1(j viceable if it were provided that all goods released from cold storage for j interstate shipment should have (piainly marked upon each package btjtbe selling or market price at which l(j they went into storage, in order that al the purchaser might be able to learn 3e what profits stood between him and 5e the producer or the wholesale dealer. [js Indeed, it would be very serviceable e. to the public if all goods destined for h interstate commerce were made to to carry upon every packing case wnose n. form made it possible a plain statere ment of the price at which they left t0 the hands of the producer. I rent. spectfully call your attention, also, to id the recommendations of the message ie referred to with regard to a federal bt license for all corporations engaged re in interstate commerce, g- In brief, the immediate legislative e- need of the time is the removal of r- all obstacles to the realization of the it best ambitions of our people in their id several classes of employment and ig the strengthening of ail instruments talities by which difficulties are to be at met and removed and justice dealt out, whether by law Ci- by some form c- of mediation and conciliation. I do not feel it to be my privilege at presld ent to suggest the detailed and parDf ticular methods by which these oblejjects may be attained, but I have ig faith that the inquiries of your seves eral committees Will discover the way er and the method. re in i i t i ' - - H 1.11 ie*|' ' - ? * * * T i 0-1 IN fc V I IN M u . ll Opera House Fri "| Pretty Ladies.

I Allow rne to call your attention to' the fact that the people of the Phil- ( ippine islands have succeeded in maintaining a stable government since the last action of the'congress in their behalf, and have thus ful-! filled the condition set by the con- j gress as precedent to a considera-1 lion ui framing muc^cjiutnLc iu ?,**** islands. I respectfully submit that this condition precedent having been fulfilled, it is now our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the people of those islands by granting them the independence which they so honorably covet.
