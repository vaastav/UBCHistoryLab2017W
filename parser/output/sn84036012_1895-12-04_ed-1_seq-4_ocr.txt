A~vaUI1. 1.1 o.tremt will be Mad mbjm.t toO WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER~ 46 10 The Message. a Tis morning the Standard prints the t gull test of President Cleveland's men- a sage; it was read yesterday afternoon In the bearing of the two houses of p' congress. It is a letter to the people of n' the United States rather than an of1 clot communication to the members of 0 congress. It omits the summaries for Q' the departments, under the charge of cabinet ofcers, which usually form a large part of presidents' messages. It reviews the country's foreign relations in a routine way, without special rec ommendation respecting the course this country ought to pursue in given Q cases and is without information that is essentially new ocoerning foreign affairs. T Nicaraguan canal project sets no notice; Cuba's troubles receive cot orless mention, the message simply adlrming the administration's determi nation to be strictly neutral. In the t juaemeat of the president, our govern meat ought to own permanent rest deuces for the use of its ambassadors in foreign capitals; and that is all there is of account in the message as a ree omnmeadation or esggestion respecting the relations of the United States to the outside world. The tariff question gets scant mention in the message. The second half of the message is devoted to a discussion of the money question. This was written, we repeat, not with the purpose of bringing recommendations to the attention of I congrees, but rather to put an anti- < silver argument before the public. I Manifestly this second half of the < message Is not, ihmt hand, the work of 1 President Cleveland. The change in < style. In composition and in expression 4 is so marked as to leave the reader to t inter that he hardly revised it. But it Is a compact summary of the situation as viewed from the goldbug stand point, whoever its author. The public is not in the habit of read ing these long annual messages; we earnestly commend to every man who wants to keep himself Informed on the currency question the careful reading of the second half of the message printed this morning-it is worth while. No matter about the goldbug sophistry in the conclusions reached by the pres ident, some matters of history are re cited and much Information is given respecting which it I. well for the in telligent citizen to refresh his memory. The raid on the reserve gets liberal attention in the message-It is referred to as "the exasperating withdrawal of gold." This might have been stopped long ago if Mr. Carlisle had exercised his unquestioned right to resort to pay ment in silver, but the administration won't have it that way. The president scolds about the raiding of the treas ury. Whose fault is it? Are the American people to blame for it or does the responsibility rest on the little money cliques whose schemes have been fostered by the administration's policy? Does the message denounce the bankers and brokers whose specu lations, at the expense of the reserve, have constituted the menace out which the message complains? There As the one-hundred-million-reserve; Mr. Cleveland admits that it stood virtually intact during eleven years. But when 9[r. Carlisle came into the treasury, Wall street began to play football with the reserve on the astonishing scale described in the message. How did thui change come about? Who, outside of administration circles, is at fault for conditions which made it possible to loot the reserve and loot it again and again? Mr. Cleveland's message takes great pains to have It appear that every dvl tar received by the government, as the reswlt of the sale of bonds, went for the seplenlshing of the reserve, and for no oetbr purpose; he denies that any part of the proceeds of the sale of bonds was used to meake good the currtnt reteeness. On that soore the public simply hawe that an eminent demo erti senator, who by the way Is an eaegg of silver, made on the senate Ccci the cha'ge which the message so Mgsgoesly resents. The message quotes Meo conadtion of the treemy at the tknes when the successive bend isues were made. as In proof ofthe fact ast for all current needs the treasury was ilands. This whole question is an 4 she of the quarrel that Involved ad- 4 oglalstration and antl-addmintrationf leesoests when the Wilson tarift bill I was approaching its crisis. In a petronlslng way, the message in fers that the free-colnse mean have had two trIals In recent times and that both kiled. It assumes. for Instance. teat th ellver-purohaee aw of 1@ was a sdeeme of silver's advocates. Nothing ooutd be farther from candor. The goINtuWe gave the Sherman act to the ooetry, believing it would serve for a t41ne as a esp. In Mr. Cleveland's ex tra session every advocate of silver die diasned allegiance to the Sherman act; the silver men wanted it repealed and a Just measure involving silver's full restoration passed in ite place. Respecting the currency. the practi oel suggestion In the message is that oll the treasury notes, greenbacks. cer tlcactes and the like, be called in and the government go out of the currency business. Of coures, the fist withdraw al of ***e notes and their permanent retirement. without a substitute. would contract the country's currency unduly. But the plan Is to issue long-4kne bonds with which to retire the greenbacks and the other currency in question, and to make these bonds the basis of circula tion for private banks--that is to say. for banks with which the government bag not direct relation. This would furnish a new basts for circulation like that on which the national hinks were originally organised. The message elab orates the plan. If It Is proposed to discontinue the mational currency, the plan outlined In the message Is probably as good as any. The first thing that would foflow this arrangement would be the disap pearance of the reserve; there would be no frther use for it. If we understand the message. Its theory is that this course would solve the whole finanmlal question. The sliver men may be "long haired" lunatics, but will some clear headed goldbug tell us how that result could possibly follow? The message would remove a wart on the finger whereas It Is a strong right arm that must be saved. It is the old story; the message pro ceeds on the theory that the proposi tion is to put a "fifty-cent" dollar on a par with a dollar worth a hundred cents. That begs the question-the proposition is, by restoring silver to its function, to let it have the place it used to have as the peer and par of gold; *what silver needs In order to take thkt place It to have its time honored function freely recognized. Mr. Cleveland says that the free-coin age men reckon from a cloudy stand point. He insists that the advocates of silver are wrong, and he simply wants them to take his word for it. There are some millions of people in this country who will not do that ChinN I. Reference to Prayer. No recent bulletins are out respect mng the spiritual condition of Col. Rob art Ingeroll. The prayers of the Chris tian Endeavorers at Cleveland were offered in his behalf Last TIhursday. Meanwhile, however, the 4ncident has u called out some highly sensible talk and a good deal of suggestive com-n ment. The pastor of the Eudlld Avenue 4 Christian church in Cleveland said to a ] Plain Dealer reporter: "I question the I wisdom of the action and the theology from whkt it springs. The conversion '1 of any soul is not simply a question of divine will. It is chiefly a question of personal choice. If Colonel Ingersoll does not want to be a Christian he will not be one." A Presbyterian clerwrgman said: "My opinion is that God can't convert the devtl unless there is a change in the deviL The supposition that God can do what He pleases irrespective of hu man choice is uneerlptural. If God can save Mr. Ingersoll by force and does not save him, God Is responsible for sin." Another Presbyterian clergyman con denned the action of the Endeavorers as inexpedient and not scriptural. It would simply put, he said, into the hands of Colonel Ingersoll a chlb which 'he would use against the Christian re ligion and the effiacy of prayer. The Plain Dealer produces plenty of testi mony furnished by clergymen who do not approve the course pursued by singling out lIgersoll ter prayer and thus advertising him. A Queer ides. South Carolina s constitutional eon veutlon appears to have bees .me of the queerest assemblages of that gird that ever the sun shone on. The eesrks. hle provisions as to marrtge, divorce and suffrage it has asked he state to incorporate into Its orgealo law are now supplemented by a proposition, t which the convention toesa.Sly ndopted, to perpetuate the peculiar liquor law now in force there and to turp over the state's profits from its whiikey busi t ness to the support of thb public schools. A storm of protest is going up t against thus linking the destinies of the two institutions. The Cvharleston t News and Courier puts 4t this way: - "If the prfdits of the disc'nsaries are e applied expressly to the support of the e echvcels every drunkard in the state ' will be able to say -that the state profits t by his vicious habits. The school teach 3 er who tells hia pupils that liquor t drinking is an evil will also have to tell c them that his salary and their educa t- lon depend in l rge m.'asure on the n continuance and extent of the evil. The e more drunkenness, the more money for 0 the schools. It would be on the same a line of policy exactly to lioetnse ganib-i h mg houses and hesmes oi proeet~UlM and apply the prints of s.ah lastlt tions to the support 0t the eeels." This is celled semtlaneWe sad &getesl. cal talk by the advocates of the eslt. ordinary provisiom. bat It is souad sewt Just the same, and i* the good people 01 South Carolin cana't strlks out iadit% vml gections oi the proposed eoistltu tion at the polls, rather tm .a per m# such a blot upon their state they wold. better kill the work of the cometit* tional convention as a wbole Cards are out for an enteasetaest to be given on Thqrsday evenitg of this week by the nmeates of the p eini at Deer Lods. Those to whom these lzvitations are addrined. £aeludng state othoers, members of he legsla ture. newspaper people sand o.tes. ought to make ita polat to attend. Rf is w3rth while to see the daange tlb have been wrought inside the walls so the prison in recent years. to toquak into the management of prison Mfsh and to get intormation, through peruO~m; al Inquiry. In regard to the disoipla and the care and treatment of &a tIn mates. Mt looks as If Tom Reed is going to emonopolise the grand-stead plaStW this 'wtnter. If you don't see what you want In the president's message, draw on Wall street. We infer from the remarks of the London Standard that Mr. Cleveland for once has stroked the lion the wrong way. The cuckoos taving receives the ofm cdel tip are now ready for business. The Western Union Telegraph com pany sent the message to the newspa pers yesterday free with its compll ments. The operators supplied the re grets. The only thing Grover seems to heen omitted in his discussion of our Inter national affairs is the Dunraven inci dent. But perhaps Bayard has convey ed the president's apologies to his bord ship privately. Stewart's introduction of a free silver bill yesterday is eald to have produced a smIle. The silver men have a way of cointg trp smiling. Winter is inviting attention to its grand opening. It would be strange enough if Presi dent Cleveland should become persona non grata to England after all his eminent services rendered. A Tacoma dispatch says the Northern Paciic is thinking of making a rate to actual settlers of $20 from Ot. Pal to Tacoma. How they are ever going to raise enough money to get out ot Ta coma is not stated. Actual settlers in Tacoma are actual settlers with a ven geance. There are several gentlemen In the country who think they could write snutdh better message and wou4l L the country to give them partei The preeident is particularly severe on China. It is pleasant to fnd a coun try that everybody can sass with impunity. This being his dirst appearance as a tall twister, the president handles the tail with gloves. To produce a good effect on congress it behooves the Cubans to force an other battle and kill at least a few of I the enemy's mnules. According to their published Inter- C views, a good many of the clergymen of ,the country are of the opinion that the I Christian Endeavorers should drop Bob Ingersdll and pray rather for a little more sense. Rufus still appears to be the sntart boy of the Peckham family. Mount Vesuviw is kind enough to honor the message with fireworks. The administration seems to reason that a vigorous foreign policy will take the curse off a weak financial one. As soon as the reading of the mes sage was over Senator Lodge fulfilled his promise of deolaring war against England. Mr. Cleveland may have no third term intentions, but he worked the wires yesterday in great shape. San Francisco Is having a horse show. Newyorhleiama seems to be becoming epidemic. Senator Hi4l may see At to deliver a course of lectures before the judiciary committee, to .Which the nomination of Judge Pelkham has been referred.

Thurman was an incessast reader of French novels while he was in congress, and he used ordinarily to keep one of the paper-bound volumes in his desk to while away the time when things were dull.

Joseph Gillott was a jeweler's appren tice 60 years ago in Birmingham. Eng Inad one day he accidentally split one of his fine stesl tools, and being suddeaty r.qutred to sign a receipt, and not flnd Ing a pen handy, he used the split tool as a substitute. This happy Incident lead to the idea of making pens of metal. Robert (loelet is said to be planning to erect the aset vMle In Newpest.
