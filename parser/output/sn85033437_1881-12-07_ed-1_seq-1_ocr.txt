The death is announced of Mr. H. N. Solomon, of Edmonton, near Lon don, in his eighty-sixth year.

Luring the whole of bis life Mr. Solomon devoted himself with untiring energy to the improvement of the members of his race. Descended from Mordecai Jaf fa, the author of a series of works known as the " Levush." Mr. Solo mon was proud of his ancestor, and he himself translated the Jewish pray er bouk into English.

The demand Jfor it in creases at the rate of 30 per t ent, a year, and even those who are inter ested in high prices and immediate sales of what is left of it, admit that in twenty years or sooner, building timber will be extremely scarce, and that in many parts of the coun try, yet supplied in part from their own soil, it will have entirely dis appeared. It is stated on good authority that more than 65.000 es tablishments, employing 400,00 per sons, and using material to the value of over $350,000,000 a year, are en gaged in the United States in manu facturing articles entirely from wool, in addition to more than 8000,000 persons partly employed on wood or ung that materia1 yearly to the value of $6,000,000.

C, in its last week's issue, says : A distressing accident occurred at this place yesterday afternoon about 2 o'clock, where, by Ezekiel Austin was accidentally killed by i'r. F. V. Wihion. The particulars, so far as we learn them, are about as follows : The deceased bantered Wilson to exchange pistols with him, and together they stepped into the office of the Singer Sewing Machine agent. Austin asked Wilson if he had any cartridges that would fit his pistol and at the same time handing it to him. Mr. Wil son had scarcely taken the pistol into his hand when it was discharged, shooting Austin through the heart, killing him al most instantly. We very much deplore this accident. Dr. Wilson has but recently come among us to enter upon the practice of his profession. It will be remembered that Austin was, at the last term of the oonrt here, acquitted of the charge of mur dering Tiluian Vance. Annoyance Avoided.

HOISE. Rev. Frederick D. Power, Chap lain, opened the proceedings of the House with prayer, this morning. " We . thank Thee, O Lord," he prayed, " for this gathering of rep resentatives of people.' We praise Thy name," for the favor Thou hast shown this "nation, and these, Thy servants, during days past We give Thee thanks, that though a cloud of sorrow has enveloped the hearts and honies of Thy people, that Thyf providence has 'preserved us f bringing joy out of sorrow 5 light out of darkness, and wisdom out of folly." Mr. Haskell offered a resolution declaring that Mr. Allen S. Campbell, delegate elect from Utah Territory, is entitled to be eworn on primu facia cases. Resolution is under discus sion, point of order being raised against it by Mr. Cox, of New York. Mr. Moree, of Massachusetts and Mr. Scales, of North Carolina, ap peared and were qualified. The work of selecting seats having been concluded, the Speaker laid be fore the House the President's mes sage, and it was read by Clerk McPherson. The reading occupied tw6 and one half hours. At first it was listened to attentively, but during the last hDur the attention flagged and the members entered into conversation with each other or retired to the cloak-rooms to smoke. When the President's views on the Mormon question were read they elicited some applause, whereupon it was repeated. As the reading was concluded, Mr. McKinney, of Ohio, then offered the following resolution which was unanimously adopted : Resolved, That a committee of one member from each State, represented int his house be appointed on the part of the House, to join the committee which may be appointed on the part of the Senate, to consider and repoit by what token of respect and aft'e tion it may be proper for the Con gress of the United States to express ajdeep Eensibility of the nation at the decease of it's late President, James Abram Garfield; and that so much of the message of the President as refers to that melancholy event, be referred to that committee. On motion of Mr. Kelly, of Penn sylvania, the President's message was ordered printed and referred to committee on the whole. Mr. McLane asked leave to offer a resolution requesting the President to communicate to the House the in structions sent by the State Depart ment to our Ministers at Chili and Peru in regard to the war between those countries. Mr. Robinson, of Kentucky, object ed on the ground that it would be time to go into that matter when the committees were appointed, and upon his motion the House at 5.30 ad journed till Friday, with the under standing that a further adjournment should then be taken until Tuesday. In the course of the afternoon Mr. Robinson, of New York, attempted to get the floor to offer a resolution af fecting the dignity of the House, but failed. The purport of the resolu tion could not be learned. 

BRUTAL BUTCHERY Of a "White Man by a Negro over a Trivial Dispute. Fortress Monroe, Ya., Dec. 0. Particulars have been received of the murder of Mr. Sclater last Friday evening, four miles north of New port. The News represents that the affair grew oat of a dispute between the deceased and a colored man named Wm. Allen, who was employed by two brothers of the name of Kelly, occupying part of Sclater's house Sclater wanted to ride in a conveyance owned by the Kellys and drawn by Allen's mules. There had been some previous trouble between Sclater and Allen in regard to an anchor which Sclater had lost and which he found in a boat belonging to Allen, when hard words passed between tha men, in" which it is said, Allen threatened to " let day-light" through Sclater the first chance he got. He refused Sclater's request to let him ride home with the Kelly brothers oa the evening of the affray, and when he reached house the quarrel was renewed. . Mrs. Kellv heard a noise and shortly after saw Allen strike Sclater, who then called him a "black thief." Allen then knocked him down and commenced choking him. It was with difficpljyhat he could be torn from his victim. ,ff As Sclater did not get up it was thought that he had fainted, and he was Ncarried into the house, when blood was found upon his clothing. Examination wa3 made and three cuts wej discovered, one back of the left shotalder, which seems to have glanced upwards and cut a gash in his head behind the ear, and two others, one of which went .through the lung and the other through his heart, killing him instantly. Sclater was a slim, delicate man, and always bore a good reputation. Kelly brothers secured Jno. Allen, who seems to have made ne effort to escape. He denied the cutting and had evidently thrown away his knife, as it could not be found. He was taken' to jail at Warwick Court House, where he is now confined. Sclater was above 30 years of age and married. His two brothers are engaged in the drug business at Hampton, Va. "A lady had the flesh eaten off her arm by scrofula. Could see the sinews working.

Death of Minister Kilpatrick at Santioga Reported. Washington, D. C, December 6. A bill was introduced by Senator Morgan to-day to regulate and dis pose of the coal lands of the United States in Alabama, that they shall hereafter be subject to disposal as agricultural lands. A bill was introduced by Senator Kellogg to provide for the opening and keeping unobstructed the navi gation of Red River. The bill provids for an expenditure of $50,000 for the purposes of this river and keeping it free from rafts and other obstruc tions. The usual scenes were enacted in the Guiteau trial to-day. The pris oner was as uBual irritable and abu sive to his counsel, and dictatorial to everybody else. EmCongressman Farwell, of Chicago, and George C. Gorham, ex-Secretary of the Senate, and now editor of the Washington Republican, were the only witnesses examined. Farwell said he had never thought Guiteau sane. No opinion as to sanity was elicited from Gor ham, and he will probably be re-called later. After announcing his willingness to propound written questions to President Arthur, provided the pros ecution agreed to admit the ques tions and answers as evidence, ScoviJle announced the defense rested. This brought another storm of abuse from Guiteau, but he was quieted by being permitted to read long extracts from his book, which he did in a dramatic style. To-morrow the cross-examination will begin, when the testim ony in rebuttal of the insanity pleA will be introduced. The Democratic Senators held a caucus this morning, at which it was decided to make no struggle in the Senate for an eqnal division of the committees, as contemplated by Sen ator Pugh's amendment to Senator Edmunds' resolution, but to leave the whole question to the generous sense of fair dealing of the Repub licans. The United States Consul at Val paraiso telegrapa to the State De partment that Minister Kilpatrio died at Santiago on Sunday last.

' THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Continued from second page.) the suppression of polygamy is urged. Ex isting statutes for the punishment of this odious crime have been contemptuously violated ever since their enactment. In deed the law has been very rarely enforced, and is practically a dead letter. The Mor mons have been recently peopling Idaho in large numbers, as well as other western ter ritories. He calls attention to the difficulty under Mormon usages of making proof of polygamy, and suggests a modification of the law of evidence, so that a wife may tes tify against her husband. . He also recom mends the passage of an act providing thnt in territories of the United States, the fact that a woman who has been married to a person charged with Liganiy shall not dis qualify her as a witness upon his Trial. He also recommends that a law be passed requiring any person who solemnizes the rites of matrimony in any of the Terri tories, under heavy penalties, to file a cer tificate of such marriage in the Supreme Court of the Territory. His discussion of the subject is earnest, practical and vigor ous. The question of general education is dis cussed and the policy of devoting the pro ceeds of the public domain to that purpose favorably mentioned. If any fund is raised for educational purposes, he suggests that it be divided among the States according to t'ae ratio of illiteracy. tensions. Ho calls attention to the large number of pension claims pending, and to the number hat have been allowed, and the number re jected since 1860. He calls attention to the inadequacy of the present clerical force in the office of the Commissioners, with which it is estimated that six years will be required to adjudicate the cases now pending. He recommends aa increase of the force. Speaking of the arrears of pension act, he says that a sum so enornjgua must be ex pended by the Government under it, that it should admonish Congress and the Execu tive to give cautious consideration to any similar projects in the future. He advises a special appropriation for the prevention of frauds in these claims. He expresses himself in favor of internal im provements and makes special men tion of the Mississippi river in this connec tion. 

CIVIL SEEVICE REFORM. He calls attention to his letter accepting the nomination of the Vice-Presidercy, in which he said that no man should be the incumbent of an office, the duties of which he is from any cause unfit. Opinion has been widely divided upon the wisdom and practicability of the various reformatory measures which have been suggested and of certain proposed regulations governing ap pointments to public office. That efficiency of appointments should be based upon fit ness is not open to dispute, but how such fitness is to be ascer tained is the question which excites discus sion. He alludes to competitive examina tions and mentions objections to the British system. These objections are enumerated, but he says that he would feel bound to approve a statute that would incorporate the essential features of the British system. He is impressed with the grave evils inhe rent in the present methods of appointment. There are very many characteristics which go to make model civil servants. Prominent among them are probity, industry, good sense, good habits, order, courtesy, tact, self-reliance and manly deference to supe rior omcers, cousiaeraiion ior interior officers. The observance of these traits is not supplied by wide knowledge of books, or by promptude in answering questions, or by any other quality likely to be brought to llgnt Dy competitive examinations, ne makes other observations on this subject, pithy, pointed and practical. He closes this part of his Message by paying a high tribute to the efficiency and integriiy of a great majority of those who are now employed in the civil service of this country. He deplores the continual decline of the merchant marine of this country, and sug gests that no question cau engage the atten tion of Congress, which is of greater magni tude or far-reaching importance. He recom mends an appropriation for the erection of a building for the Congressional library, and suggests the improvement of the Potomac, malaria-breeding marshes in the District of Columbia. 

VOTING FOR PRESIDENT. The importance of timely legislation with respect to the ascertainment and declaration of the vote for Presidential electors was sharply called to the attention of the peo ple more than four years ago. It is to be hoped that some well-defined measure may be devised before another national election which will render unnecessary a resort to any expedient of a temporary charaeter for the determination of questions upon con tested returns. Questions which concern the very existence of the government and the liberties of the people were suggested by the prolonged ill ness of the late President and his consequent incapacity to perform the functions of his office. It is provided by the second article of the constitution, in the fifth clause of its first section, that "In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office the same shall devolve on the Vice-President." What is the intenttion of the constitu tion in its specification of "inability to dis charge the powers and duties of said office?" Is one of the contigeucies whieh calls the Vice-President to the exercise of presi dential funotions the inability limited in its nature to long continued intellectual in capacity or has it a broader import ? What must be its extent and duration? How must its existence be established? Has the President, whose inability is the subject of inquiry, any voice iu determining whether or not it exists, or is the decision of that momentous and delicate question confided to the Vice-President; or is it con templated by the Constitution that Con gress should provide by law, precisely what should constitute availability, and how, and by what tribunal or authority should it be ascertained ? If the inability proves to be temporary in its nature, and during its continuance, the Vice-President carefully exercises the func tions the of Exeeutive by what term does he hold his office? Does he continue as President for the re mainder of the four year term, or would the elected President if his inability should cease in the interval be empowered to re sume his office, and if having such lawful authority, he should exercise it, wonld the Vice-President be theieupon empowered to resume bis powers and duties as such ? I can not doubt thatthese important ques tions will receive your' early and thoughtful consideration. Deeply impressed with the gravity of the responsibilities which have so unexpectedly devolved upon me, it will be my constant purpose to co-operate with you in such measures as will promote the glory of the country and the prosperity of ite people.

Special te the Dally Chraicle. Nashville, December 6. The fire in the penitentiary was caused by a convict throwing a piece of hot iron into a tub filled with pitch. Workmen commenced this morning tearing away the debris, preparatory to the erection of a building to be used un til the erection of a new peniten tiary. Argument on the petition to ad vance the 103 debt compromise in junction suit on the docket of the Supreme Court, has been set for next Monday, in that Court The Legislature will have a quorum to-morrow. Governor Hawkins will send in a special message relative to the objects on which the assembly has been called to legislate. The general impression is that the legislative representation will not be increased. When a lecturer has werked the ladies of his audience so near to the weeping point that they have gotten out their handker chief, and then suddenly changes his tone and speaks of the merits of Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup, he is bonnd to rouse a feeling of indignation. "We can hardly escape from the conclusion, that worms show some degree of intelligence." This is Mr. Darwin's latest discovery. It is an nounced in a new book that he has just published. He adds: "Worms have played a more important part in the history of the world than most persons would at first suppose." In deed, "it may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part : the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures.'1 For, say in Great Uritian alone, there are not less than 20,000 or 30,000 in every one of 32,000,000 acre suit able for their activity, therefore, a population of at least 640,000,000, 000 w. rms ; and for a million years they and their ancestors have been at work fertilizing that soil. Ploughs, Mr. Darwin says, they are, forever ploughing away. One of the neat things about this is, that the London Spectator, review his book, turns on the "materialistic fanatics," who used Darwin's earlier works in attacks on the argument from design in nature, and wants to know how they will re ceive thi ; for "the earth worms are the ploughs by which the surface of the globe was being prepared to yeild man harvests had been even conceived, except in the mind of that Eternal Wisdom to which the future is present contains the augury of the future."
