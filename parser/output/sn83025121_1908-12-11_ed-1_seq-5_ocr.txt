Tho general public is beginning to srako up and take nn interest in tho coming race meet at Kilo on Fridny nod -Saturday, January 1 and 2. Owners and those who make' their living in dealing and caring for horses have, of course, been interested for some time and have watched tbo entries closely, but tbo general run of men who like n sporting event but don't trouble their heads very much about dope, aro just beginning to realize that this meet is coming olT in a short timo and that to bo there a start must bo made in two weeks. Tho two principal events will bo on tho first day., Thoy aro tho $1750 Mer-chant's stakes, weight for ago, IVi mile and tho free-for-all pace, best two in tlireo heats, one mile, 'with a $250 purso to tho winner nnd the Holmes cup if 'tho timo is 1:18 or botter. Tho stnko raco is for named entries1 from Onhu, Maui nnd Hawaii. Adlon, Maui; Brunor nnd Yola Girl, Honolulu; Frolic nnd Banonlca, Hilo. So far as" can be ascertained at present, Adion, tho Maui entry is likely to start tho favorite. Jockey who is training him, is very confident of victory and states that he is only afraid that tho gelding will mako a fool of the Hold. This may bo "put down as trainer's-optimism, howovcr. Adion is a fast runner and a good one at tho distance but there aro numbers of local sportsmen who do not see where ho has n cinch by any means. k Brunor, who is being trained nt tfie Honoulluii ranch, will b6 shipped very shortly nnd will work out with Indigo for the' last time this morning. Thero is quite a possibility that Jockoy ho who rides horses with unknown names', may come from thg Coast to ride Brnner. Charlie David, ownpr of Yola Girl nnd Trilby Green and who wished to enter tho latter, but put in Yola Girl when the othor owners Itickcd, states that tho Trilby mare is doing well but that Yola Girl has had a fit of tho sulks lately and doesn't seem to come out of it. ' Frolic and Bnnonica, the Hilo entries, I aro both doing well and their owners ,' nro gaining confidence thnt they will bo iUUlU Ub kill. , Tho big running event is attracting much attention but tho harness bugs aro talking 'about nothing but the pac ing race. Waldo J., tho oldtimer, was shinned on tho Manna Ivca yesterday nnd will have time to get over bis sea trip well before, the race. It Is not yet docidqd who wilt drive, tbo, Honolulu, champion, but vit is reported that Jim Qulnn "or Jnclc Gibson will held tho reins when the starter calls it a go. Thero is quite a little sentiment attaching to this fast gelding. T6n years ago Waldo J. was nt the zenith of bis career 6n the Coast. Tom Tlollinger, tho sportsman blacksmith, bought him and has been using bim as a buggy horso ever since as he had no opportunity for racing him, Tom and his family grow very much attached to tho horSo and Tom put a prohibitive figure on him when anybody talked about buying. Recently, how-over, Julian Monsarrnt was a successful bidder for tbo horse and, wbilp tho price is not given out, it is known that it was a comparatively low figuro, tho father inducement being a promise made by Mr. Monsarrat that tho old horse would havo a good homo anditho best of care after the race. The Hilo people have imported a younger horso to beat Waldo J. This is Harry Hurst, 2:14, which, as stated- in tho Advertiser yesterday morning, bad arrived nt Hilo on tho steamer Enterprise. While this horso has a good record on tho Coast, there aro many who ilguro thatjhe -will hnvd little chanco with tho grand old Waldo J Tho long sen trip and the change of climate is Lou ml to upset tho animal, and it is not likely, they say, that ho will bo acclimatized and fit for a hard raco by the first of tho year. Charlie David has chnrgo(of tho new importation at Hilo, ami is doing his best to fit bim for tho big event. If thero is anybody who can put tho. on- try right for the linrd race under now conditions, it should certainly bo the gonial Charlie. Tho Japanese on Hawaii aro taking n. tremendous interest in the races, and thero will bo all kinds of entries for the Jnpnneso events. Each of tbo plantations is sending its star per- 'former to uphold its honor on tho track, and lareo sums of money will change bands tn theso events, as each norso win nave a largo following or admiring and part-owning Japanese, The program as arranged by ilr, "Wright looks ycry good, nnd two days of fast and clean sport should bo tho result. Mr, wrigbt win arrive in Honolulu in a day or two to attend to business details in connection with tho meet nnd see tho people with regard to an excursion at a rato low enough to make it attractive' to each and every, sportsman who likes to sec a horse race.

It lasted fifteen innings nnd wns won by tho Marines by 8 to 7 In the last half of tho fifteenth with two men down and i tho soldiers two runs ahead. Tho first scoro was raado by tho Marines in tho third inning. They batted ,out two but tbo soldiors came back with one in" the fourth and three in tho fifth which put them two in tho lead. In tho eighth tho visitors tied tho scoro and, nsthero was nothing doing in the ninth, they started in on n tenth period. Tho tonth, eleventh and twelfth innings went by without a score but in the mlrteonth tho homo players 'scored a run and thoy looked to have victory in 'their Vrasp, but Shavo came homo on a neat taluglo by Masak and tbo scoro was tlod again. In the first of tho fifteenth tho soldiers made two tuns and this time it seemed certain that thoy would win but the Marines came up with tiro in their eyes determined to do something. Thoy did. Snavo and Winter both flow out and it looked snd for tho visitors but Ludo-man singled and thon Masak delivered a terrific swat over -center field that netted him two bags and sent Ludo-man in. Masak 'a swat was a hard ono but tho one that Anderson handod out .immediately afterwards was a regular it took him to third and sent Masak-in, tying tho score. Only one man to put out but ono on third. It was nip and tuck nil right but Miko was thoro with a timely bingle and Anderson romped in, scoring tho winning run after as pretty a pleco of batting and ' Tunning as tho Fort Shnfter dlampnd over saw. This is tho second victory for tho Marines on the sqldicrs' ground. Tho last time they played thorn they won by 13 to C.

Coach haughton GETS THE CREDIT A very comploto and interesting ac-i count of the Harvard victory over Yale appears in the Harvard Bulletin of Wednesday -November 25. Tho entire game is carefully covored by 'description, photographs nnd diagrams and tho front page presents ono of tho most remarkable football pictures ever taken. This picture shows Kennard in tho 'act of kicking tbo goal that won tho game. Kennard is standing well back of the line, on his right foot, whilo his left is still poised in tho air after tho kick. The ball is soen distinctly rising over the breaking up line and not more than twelve feet abovo tho ground. Ono of the most interesting features of the story is 'that, perhaps unconsciously, the writer gi es tho credit for the victory to Coach Haughton. Tho following extract tho story brings out tho fnrsightcdnessT'und keen discrimination of tho conch. "In spite of all these reasons which advised against tho chanco, Mr. Haughton saw an opportunity which might never come again and ho took advantage of it by sending Kennard to tako "Ver Wiebo's place. The result was tho score which won tho gamo, "This was only one of tho many instances in which tho judgment of tho Harvard coach ployed on important part in winning tho game. Towards the end second half -when Yale, by the long punts of Coy, bad forced Harvard back almost against her own goal posts, tho time camo when it was essential for some Harvard man to kick the ball just as far out as it be carried. Then Mr, Haughton sent Sprague on tbo Hold to tolco place. Spraguo can kick tho ball, but ho is very light and inexperienced and during most of the season ho has been incapacitated on account of nn injured knee; but ho took his place on tho team, stood well behind his own gonl line, and an tho faco of tho fierco Yale attack kicked the ball yards, so that it landed on Harvard's forty-five-yard lino, A fbw minutes later, Sprague, having accomplished tho thing which no was sent in to do, re tired in favor of Leslie, who played out tho game and was rushing the ball ahead when time was called."

Extra sessions of Congress, such as thnt which President-elect Taft has promised to call next spring, always tower high in public interest. Officially they aro called ' extraordinary sessions." There has been hardly nn extra session that did pot develop something of historic importance to bo recalled and expatiated upon, long after tbo ordinary sessions of tho -federals lawmaking bodies have -been far-gotten. For that reason tho pooplo have been educated to look upon an extra session ns n very noteworthy incident of any administration at Washington. And yot an extra session of Con gress in nction is generally very tamo and uninteresting to tho in tvasmngion. it rarciy nag unu mo in' tercst to visitors, or oven to tbo case-hardened residents of tho national cap Hal, that a regular session has. It may not bo so with tho extra session of the first year of tbo Taft administration, but, all tho same, tho signs point to many exceedingly dull, dreary days on tho bill where the Capitol stands. Manufacturers nnd' merchants will bo deeply concerned over tho raising or lowering of duties on articles, mostly, of strnngo names. A fraction one wiry or nnother can easily precipitate a protest of voiccfnl proportions. In the long run all theso "things affect tho millions of plain people, who have to foot tho bills, but the plain peoplo nro generally very indifferent to such mntters of legislation. If thoy hnyo nny rearing nnd tearing to do, it will firobably como long after tho Tovlsion aw has been signed nnd after newspapers and orators have dinned' it into their heads that their representatives down nt Washington havo given somebody clso tho long end of tbo tariff bargain. Uncertainty About Big Debate. Thero may bo a big tariff debate, but big debates in Congress can not safoly bo prognosticated. Thoso that ate widely advertised have nn annoying tendency not to becomo "big debates at all. On the other hand, n few words Bpokcn in the courso of Toutino proceedings often loose an avalancho of heated discussion. Should Somo Democrat got his knifoT into a crcvico of tho Republican protection armor, ns may or may not happeu half n dozen times during-consideration of tbo forthcoming tariff bill, thero would bo a high old congressional shindy ovory time the performance occurred. Tho Democrats aro already promising somo tariff oratory, especially tho Scnato Democrats, but it is possiblo to put too much faith in such promises. An impression prevails in Washington that public, sentiment in tbo United States, after much rantankorous activity under tho prodding of Tbeodoro Roosevelt. President, is relapsing' into n dormant and satisfied stato, much as it wns during the years of thq Mc- Klnley administration. The people want to mnko mogcy, lots oi money, and 'then more money, again.. If it turns out thnt public sentimont is becoming indifferent, it will bo difficult 'to stir up much of n tariff dobato at tho extra session" of Congress, for public sentimont is a tremenddus factor in making legislators at Washington sit tip nnd tako notice. If their cease to swarm on tho ramparts, Congressmen becomo lethargic and it is easier to put through big deals nt Washington. House Will Speed tho Bill. No great tariff debating is looked .for in tho House of Representatives during tho extra session. It can bo put downc as certain thnt "Uncle- Jpo" Cannon, who will bo reelected Speaker, and all his lieutenants will bo very impatient about tbo running of tho sands by tho timo tho extra Bession has boon organ ized for, business. Thoy will give jiiBt nsj low daj'8 as tucy tninic will mr discussion of the tariff bill. Perhaps they will allow tho debate to bo "wido open" for a week or thereabouts. But tho muttcrings in tho. corridors and cloakrooms aliout tho folly of staying in Washington all summer, when men might bo home, attending to personal business and making monoy, will- become rntppnnt hfter a little. Tho Speaker nnd 390 other members will bo making flings at their ancient onemy, tho Scnato. Every Representative is an enemy of tho Senato till be hlmslf is elected thereto. Tho prospect of n long talk on tariff at that end of tho Capitol will l)e emphasized and then will como tho nrgumont, old as tho application of tho cloturo rulo in tho House, thnt it is no use to wqsto timo talking when tho Houso must -wait nnyway till tbo Senato talks itsolf out. Tho tariff revision bill will bo ns good as framed by tho timo tho extra session of Congress convenes. That will probably be about tlioSniddle of March. Mr. Taft lias already said that ho will call it just as soon as ho can. Whilo no Icnnthy notlco is required by the constitution, it is usual to allow about two weeks. Tlmt gives eonators ana members timo to get to Washington. Kven the delegates from Hawaii and Alaska can travel from Honolulu and Sitkn in fifteen days. Election of a Speaker. Tho Senato and Houso must both organize as soon as Congress meets in extra session, for it1 will be tho first session of a now Congress, Tho Houso will proceed to that task speedily. It has more to do in tho organization lino than has the Senate, but generally does it moro speedily. The Senate always has a presiding off! cor, ready to take. up tbo gavel. Tbe .House at the uegln nlng of a Congress, has no presiding officer and the1 very first thing must cbooso one. That, will be dono in two or roll calls, for tho Republican caucus, which will meet n few days in advance, will haxo nominated, not only n candidate for Speaker, but candidates for half a dozen offices, Including clerk, sergeant-at-arms, .chaplain, doorkeeper, and postmaster. One day will suffice lor that work nnd for tho swearing in of -members nnd for the, great biennial lottery? in which 301 members will draw their scats for tho next; two years.

It almost goes without saying that tho Speaker will appoint 'only those committees that havo to do with legislation suggested in tho President's message. For it is a prnctiso, generally adhered to, that an extra session of Congress shall consider littlo business outside of that for which tho President called it together. That means tho Speaker will appoint only tho Ways and Means, tho Rules, and tho Mileage and Accounts committees. Hq can do that in short order. Tho Ways and Means membership will bo about the same as in tho present Congress nnd will deal with tho revision, which probably will ,bo tho only legislative matter mentioned in President Tnft's message.

Thero will bo somo exdeutivo business to disposo of perhaps a treaty or two to 'be ratified and undoubtedly several large batches of nominations .from President Tnftj, to bo confirmed.

How long thnt commit tee will require to go over tbo l'ayiio bill is a matter of conjecture. Tho prospocts aro that it will not bo moro thnn two or thrco weeks. Much will depend upon tho extent to which tho Finance Committee wishes to rewrite tho Houso measure and tho number of witnesses it hears. Almost from! the day that tho Sonnto nnd tho Finnnee Committeo get tho Payno bill the Houso will begin adjourning for thrco dnys nt a stretch unless President Taft recommends in his message legislation other than 'on tho tnriff. That is what tho Houso did at tho last oxtra session of note that, df 1897, when tbo Dingley law was passed. It enables members who llvo a day's rldo or so from Washlncton to go homo and attend to their own rifle contests in conference, which eon- lqrcnce is usually composed of either thrco or fivo members of the Ways and Means Committee and a similar number of tho Finnnco Committco. It was bo with tho Wilson bill and again with the Dingley bill. Hut not only are standpatters in tbo saddle in tho Scnato and tho Houso, but they aro nbw standpatters, who enjoy very relations and who think along about tho samo lines. They have been cooperating ns novcr beforo in tho preliminary work of gathering data for a "scientific revision" (a favorito Stnndpat term just now), and it may happen that they will break some records next summer in cooporating toward the speedy enactment of a new tariff law. The men who will figure as leadors nt tho extra session can easily bo named in advance. For tho, Houso there will bo Bpcakor Cannon, Chairman Sereno E. Payne nnd Representative John Dalzell of tho Ways and Moans Committee, and a Democrat or two, chief of whom will bo Champ Clark of Missouri, slated for minority lead' er. The other Republican licutonants in tho Houso will have small chance of gaining much notorloty, as matters Ipok nowf Thoy are men identified with other committees which have nothing to do with tnriff legislation, Will Tolcrsto No "Butting In." It is only once in a decade,. qr that the Ways and Means It psa enables tho House to emphasize to the country- that it has disposed of the tariff bill nnd but for the dilatory Senate tbe country would now have a. tariff law and there' would be no mora causo to worry about it. Tbo Houso leaders are very fond of em -,'1.' phatlr.ing tht. whon any legislation such as a tariff bill is von tho ways. They nover tako tho pains to emphasize that most legislation ot that ehnrncter has to como from tho House, by provision ot tbo constitution, And that the Senate, even if It bo tho1 bulwark of vest oil Interests, ns has been claimed, legislates much more carefully than the Houso and, In many instances, much set tor, Long Discussion In Sonate.

As soon ns tho Inst Sennto roll-call on the Pnyno bill has boon taken, the usually long nnd earnest strugglo in conference begins. Tho conferees may tnko a week or a month to ndiust their differences, during which both Sennto nnu .House mny enjoy All tho tariff bills of recent years hnvo boon passed ohly nftcr has a chance to get into tho limelight when tho tariff is bolng nnd it naturnlly keeps nil tho glory for Itself.

Tho Sennto leaders will bo chiefly thrco Senators Aldrich of Rbodo Is- Innd, chnlrinnn of Finance; Hnlo of Mnlne, n member tbcrcor, and 01 Totns, who will bo tho leader of tho Senate minority. Thero Is moro probability of individual senators, out sido of tho Finance Committee, oxort ing somo positivo influonco in shnp ing tho tariff bill thnn of a Uko oc currenco iu tho House. Tho Dingley law wns onnctod under very similar 'elrcuinstnnccs to thoso under which the Pnyno law will bo passed. Its chronology may therefore lip worth while, ,ns indicating somo1 thing of what mny bo expected of noxt spring's oxtra session. Tho extra, or first, session of tho Fifty-fifth Congress was called to meet March 10. lSDi, by Prosldont McKlnloy, eloven dnys after bo wns Inaugurated. 1 Itepresentntlvo Dingloy of Maine, chairman of Ways nnd Mcnns, introduced bill No, 370, "to provido rovonuo for tho govern ment nnd to encourage tho industries of the United State," on Mnrcb 18, It hnd been prepared by tho Ropubli cans of tho committco previous to that time, and No. 371) roprosonted tbo deliberate judgment of- tbo commlttoo, It was formally reported to tbo Houso Friday, March JD, tboro Having been a mcctinc of tho full committeo in tbo meantime, nt which tbo Democrnts of tho committeo wero glvon tho courtesy of having a first look at tho measure. Discussion on the Dingley BUI. Tho Houso debate on tho bill began Monday, March 22, and wns concluded with tho passage of tho bill March 31. Tho Houso hnd mot at 10 o'clock daily and hnd held ovenlng sessions from 8 till 11 for purposes of debate. Tho Sonnto received tho bill April 1 nnd it wns immcdintolv referred to tho Finnnco Committee, which roportod it back to tho Scnato May 4. 'i'lio won' nfo dobato on tho bill, which had virtually been rewritten by Senator Al drich, was not concluded till July 7. Tim conferees woro forthwith appoint ed, but did not reach an ngrccmont fill .Tnlv ID. Sonnto and Houso thereupon entored into u debate on the conferenco report, and it was July 21 before that report 'bad been finally accepted by both houses. It wns signed by President McKinloy the sumo day, which dny tho extra session adjourned. Whilo both branches of Congress woro nlmost as strongly Republican thon ns now, the chances favor n moro speedy enactment at noxt spring's session. President Tnft will likely have tbo Payno law by tho middle of Juno, perhaps earlier. Tho Wilson law was cnactod at tho regular, or long session, of tbo Fifty-third Congress. It assomblcd December 4, 1893, and lasted till August 28 of tho following yenr. Tho Republicans have bdeomo very chary of frnining a tariff bill at a regular Bession of Congress, It can bo don'o only at tho long session, which meets in December, aftor a President is inaugurated, ilnd gonorally runs up to within n few months of tbe noxt Congressional elec tion. Tho formal party claim always is that there is not sufficient opportunity for calm deliberation over a tariff bill at u regular session, but a stroncor reason is thnt If tho pooplo get mod whon they at last find out what a tar lit Inw contains, tliorc is timo for their nngor to cool boforo election, provided the work is dono In an extra session. Othorwise with public sentimont arousod right it) the midst of a campaign, tho party that enacted tho tariff law will almost certainly bo defeated in the election for Congress. aavo Democrats the House. That was tho caso with the tariff law. It 1ms been declurcd a very fair tin iff law, but there was great popular misunderstanding of it, which tho Republicans could not dispel in time to havo their case decided on its merits at tho elections for the Fifty-second Congress, nnd tho Democrats camo into tbo control of tho House by an almost unprecedented majority, Thero was a littlo nnalogy with tho situation nt the cjoso or tbo congress, wbon tho .Republicans used tho Wilson tariff mil to great auvantngo and won a tremendous majority at the elections for the Fifty-fourth Congress. A notable extra session of tho last twenty years was that during tho first year of Cleveland's second administration, when tho Democrats "controlled both branches of Congress. It was called August 7, 1893, to repeal the silver purchaso clause Tho Senate Democrats were nearly all Sllvcritcs. Thoro'wero enough of them, with Silver Republicans, to make u clear majority.

This machine was shown in nctivo operation carrying tho entire load of tho Hawaiian Electric Company.
