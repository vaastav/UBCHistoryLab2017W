Judge Houk has been interviewed by a correspondent of the Washington JRejmblican on the Presidential ques tion. He gives it as his opinion that a majority of Tennessee Republicans are for Grant. As for himself, he says he would prefer not to violate the tra ditions of the country by electing even General Grant to a third term. He expresses himself favorable to John (Sherman. We had expected to be able to give our readers the full text of the Presi dent's message this morning, but for some reason which we are unable to explain, we failed to receive it. We received on Saturday morning a tele gram from the President's Private Sec retary, staling that it had been for warded by express. Bat it failed to arrive, and we are enabled to give only a synopsis of it. The Decent Newspaper. Boston Herald. There is good reason to believe that the clean newspaper is more highly prized to-day than it was four or five years ago. It is also safe to predict that as people in all ranks of life, who protect their own at least from contamination, become more conscious of the pernicious in fluence of a certain class of jour nals, called enterprising because they are ambitious to serve updirty scandals, they will be careful to see that the journals they permit to be read in the family circle are of the class that never forget the proprie ties of life. Already men and wo men of refinement and healthy morals have had their attention called to the pernicious influence of bad litera ture, and have made commendable efforts to counteract the same by causing sound literature to be pub lished and sold at popular prices. These efforts arc working a ilent but sure revolution. The best au thors are more generally read to day than at any previous time. The sickly sentimental story paper and wild ranger and pirate story book are steadily yielding the field to worthier claimants. To the praise of the decent newspaper, it may be said that, where it has a place in the family, and has been read for years by young and old, it has de veloped such a healthy tone and such a discriminating taste that the literature of the slum3 has no ad mirers.
