As much cannot be said of those who have been so persist ently maligning and ridiculing him.

It is to be feared that a change from the gov ernment of Peixoto to that of Mello would be a leap from the frying-pan into ths fire. ■ Another revolution is imminent in Costa Rica, but the government at Wash ington has taken the precaution of having one of our new cruisers, the San Fran cisco. on hand at the scene of the dis content. American residents, therefore, will be assured protection for both their lives and property, which could not be guaranteed before our new navy, the creation of a Democratic administration, was floated. The present is as favorable an oppor tunity as will be presented for the sen ate to so amend its rules as to conform to modern legislative practice. These f tiles are a jumble of inconsistencies, and tend to retard rather thau promote She transaction of business. If the sen ate desires to retain the respect and confidence of the public, and to perpet uate its own existence, it will lose no time in so amending its rules of order as to place it beyond the power of a cap tious minority to block the wheels of legislation for months at a time, as was done during the consideration of the silver repeal bill. ?__??? -**— It is to be feared that the plans of the promoters of the new museum at Chi cago will have to be revised. It was proposed to remove the world's fair manufactures building to the site which should be selected. The recent snowfall, however, has done serious damage to the structure, and demon strated the fact that it could never be made safe for the collection of curiosi ties that might be stored in It, or forthe visitors. The building will therefore have to undergo remodeling, or it will have to be abandoned altogether, lt is fortunate that the damage was done thus early, for the loss that might accrue at a later day might be irrepara ble. ._ Chicago is to have a new literary magazine to be called the Lakeside, which is intended as a rival of the lead ing periodicals of the East. The experi ment of establishing such a magazine has beer, repeatedly tried, but has always been a failure. Yet there are scores of literary meu in the Western metropolis who enjoy a high standing, and whose contributions are among the most interesting features of the Eastern publications. The chief difficulty here tofore has been with the business man agement of these enterprises. If men competent to manage the financial end can be enlisted, there seems to be uo good reason why the venture should not be a success. -«»- . The story that has obtained currency through the medium of a few newspa pers hostile to the administration to the effect that. Queen Liliuokalani, of the Hawaiian islands, is to receive half a million dollars on condition of her abdi cation of the throne, is too absurd to merit serious comment. : The most credulous will be puzzled to know who the people who are to pay the money are, and what their object is. Congress, which alone has the authority to appro priate assay, has no authority to invest iv second-band thrones, even if it had the disposition to do so, and it is not likely tbat private persons wil! be found re«<Jy to put up their good money for such a purpose. i— _ ..

THE 

PBESIDKNT'S MESSAGE. The president's message Is a strictly business document. It is long, but not unnecessarily so, for? a multitude of topics have called for attention at the hands of the executive— that are of the gravest concern, and in '.which the public manifests a interest. ? The discussion of our relations: with: foreign powers possesses, the merit of brevity, but a further message is prom ised on affairs in Hawaii, which will be awaited- with interest.; The president: contents himself at this time with the statement that "the constitutional gov ernment of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government, and through the in timidation caused by the presence of an; armed naval force of the United States,! which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed. It seems to mo the only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us, and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible inter vention. With a view of accomplishing this result within the constitutional limit of executive power, and recognizing ail our obligations and responsibilities growing out of any changed condition brought about by our unjustifiable in terference, our present minister at Hon olulu has received appropriate instruc tions to that end."' The necessity of the negotiation of treaties of extradition with some of the Central American republics was brought to the attention of this government by recent negotiations for the surrender of Weeks, the defaulter, and the president suggests that such affairs be made a matter of international obligation rather than of favor— a view that will be cor dially approved, especially in this sec tion, where the presence of fugitives from our laws is so earnestly desired. The interests of the several depart ments of the government receive due consideration at the hands of the presi dent, and his recommendations designed to maintain or increase their efficiency will receive tne cordial indorsement of all parties. There may be differences of opinion as to the best means by which the objects sought may be attained; there is no difference among patriotic Americans as to the desirability of the ends aimed at. Especially will this ap proval be voiced relative lo the policy of promoting the enlargement of our navy and the strengthening of our army. All Americans feel. a pride in the fact that the navy that flies the stars and stripes is of such a character as to command the respect and admiration of ail the nations of the world, and any failure to maintain that character will be regarded as unwise and unpatriotic. Congress will appreciate the importance of the subject by extending to that de partment a liberal encouragement in the good work in which it is engaged. The interests of agriculture receive unusual attention. The work of the department in the past is commended, while much consideration is given to plans by which its efficiency may be increased. His recommendation that all inspectors in the bureau of animal industry be required to hold a diploma from some veterinary college of estab lished reputation is worthy of adoption, to the end that the losses frequently suffered by reason of the ignorance of these officials may be avoided in the future. He also advises a continuation of the free distribution of seeds by the department after they shall have, been properly tested and approved.. Taken as a whole, the message shows a careful scrutiny of all questions of public concern, and an intimate knowl edge of conditions political, economic and industrial that betokens the deep personal interest of the executive in everything that concerns the welfare of the people. It is not, perhaps, as erudite as some of the state papers that have preceded it, but it is eminently practical— such a document as might be expected from an executive who was more deeply concerned in con ditions than in theories, lt is, perhaps, too utilitarian to suit the visionaries of the country, but it will commend itself to the practical common sense ot the people. '" Zf' THE 

CALL TO DUTY. President Cleveland closes his long message to congress with a call of Dem ocrats to their duty that is as strong and clear as a bugle note. . He reminds Democratic representa tives and senators that pledges have been made to the people which it is their privilege and their duty to redeem. He urges them to be true to their trust He warns them that merited dismissal will follow the forfeiture of the pledge by their dereliction. He appeals to Democrats to release themselves from the selfishness or' their local interests and be representatives of the nation, not of localities. He asks them to reverse in this the Republican principle of aggregating the selfishness of industries really or imaginatively favored, with all its narrowing aud de basing effects. It is an appeal to patriot ism, as Republicanism is an appeal to selfishness and greed. He makes the bill reported by Mr. Wilson's committee an administration measure. Without qualification he adopts it and urges, its passage. He lucidly states his guiding principle— release from or reduction of taxation ot the necessaries of life— making the con ditions of the great mass of th£ people easier. He clearly . states the effect in the widening of the markets of our man ufactures, with the resultants of steadier employment and diminished cost of living for the workingman. He shows that the true fostering of manufactures lies not in decrease, but in enlargement of opportunities. He condenses in a few lines the whole argument for tax reduction. YY Those of us who would have had the -new tariff go much farther in the live of reducing protection by taxation can find reassurance in promise of adher ence to the principle of a tariff adjusted solely to the ends of revenue, and - that the present measure is not considered a finality. If we cannot have at ouce all we wish for we are willing to take what it is deemed wise aud best to give pres ently, assured that when the beneficial effects of this measure are felt we will all move on farther in the direction of free exchange of commodities. . :-■ So Democrats who, moved by local Interests, feel that the bill goes too far, and we who think it goes not far enough should meet the- middle ground of the Wilson bill and- stand to gether for it, trusting in the wJadon>,tho unselfishness and the statesmanship of its framers. Thus, with "a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together," we will reverse the selfish policy that has dominated the country to its hurt for thir ty years.and start It along on the path of a prosperity which will not be disturbed | and unbalanced in iv dtetiibution by . .. ■*■ ■■■ : THE .g-OffT.- r&UL

Gentlemen of- 7 the Fifty-third : eon-_ gress, "He gives ' twice - who ■ gives quickly." ' • THE PRESIDENT ON PENSIONS President Cleveland's position on the pension laws: is so clearly stated in his message that ' there need be no excuse for j misconstruction. *- "Every. | fraudu lent pensioner," he says, "-has become a bad citizen; every false oath in support of a pension has made perjury . more common; : and false \ and undeserving pensioners rob the people not- only of their money, but of the patriotic senti ment which the survivors of a war fought for the? preservation of the Union ought to inspire. *f.*f* By no means the least wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners, who cer tainly ought not to be condemned to such associations." IVY. There is no word in this utterance to which any honest man _or any brave veteran can take exception. The senti ments are those of one sincerely desir ous of maintaining the honor of the men who risked their lives for their country, and who would defend , them" from enemies far more to be dreaded than those whom they overcame on the field of battle. The welfare of. the old soldiers will be protected as long as Grover Cleveland possesses the power to extend his aid, and it can be no bet ter guarded thau by exposing and de feating the plans of those who seek unworthily a place upon the . pension roll,, which under all circumstances should be made a roll of honor. - VAN ALiKN 

STKPSDOWX. Every manly man will have a higher regard for Ambassador James J. Van Alen after reading the correspondence published yesterday ' in which he de clines to accept the office of United States ambassador to Italy, to- which he was reently * appointed by President Cleveland and confirmed by the senate. Mr. Van Alen does not deem it neces sary todefetul his action in contributing towards the success ot the Democratic party at the last presidential election. He speaks of the circumstance from the standpoint of an American citizen — claims that it was his right to assist a cause whose success" he believed to be essential to prevent the ascendency of that parly which "would be not only a hindrance to national progress, but in time a positive menace to the success of popular government." He furthermore states that, if the necessity again arises and the opportunity offers, he will pur sue a course in line with his past con duct.- He resigns his office in order that the president may be relieved from any embarrassment which his appointment has caused, not because he is conscious of having performed any act that should disqualify him from holding it. The president's reply is equally frank. Mr. Cleveland regrets the step taken by Mr. Van Alen, because he is convinced that he would ably represent the Amer ican government abroad, and because of the high personal esteem in which he holds the ambassador. He assures him that he would under no circumstances have pursued acourse other than that he has taken, and is still convinced of the wisdom of the appointment. Thus ends the Van Alen incident, that has been the cause of so much dis cussion throughout the land. In a nut-, shell, the case is simply this: Mr. Van Alen desired the success of the Demo cratic party at the last presidential elec tion, and, like other good Democrats and excellent citizens, did what he could to bring about the desired result, neither claiming nor expecting recom pense for his outlay or effort. * The pres ident, knowing him only as a gentleman of good repute among his fellows, and competent in every respect to fill the place, named him for a foreign office, in ignorance of the fact that he had con tributed any .considerable amount to the campaign fund, and indifferent as to whether he had done so or not. The subsequent developments in the case did not affect the merit of the appoint ment, nor did they cast any reflection upon the character of the appointee. And, notwithstanding the ado made by the press over. the transaction, notwith standing the denunciations and criti cisms of the press, and the ridicule heaped upon Mr. Van Alen, the senate confirmed his Domination with substan tial unanimity. His resignation is, how ever, a praiseworthy act, and establishes right to a high place in the public es teem. IN THE 

THEATERS. "The Span of Life" Opened to a -;-.""_ _ Big House. "The Span of Life" is a very appro priate name for the melodramatic per formance presented for the first time in St. Paul at the Metropolitan opera house last night. The reason for thus naming the play has been considerably discussed, but the name must have been suggested to the author by the thrilling incident which occurs at the end of the third act. - . * v- * Most of the action of the play takes place in Africa and England, the open ing scene being an ineffectual effort to blight the life of Richard Blunt, the hero, who, with his wife and child, flees to the diamond fields of Africa. I To this place he is followed by his enemy, Dunstan Leech, who has taken up the calling of a slave trader. Aided by Arabs, Leech seizes Blunts wife and child. By the husband aud father the captives are set at liberty, but in their freedom he is powerless to protect them. To escape Leech and the Arabs the mother flees through an African wilderness. In her flight she reaches a gorge, and finding it impassable she resolves to kill herself and child, rather thau be captured by her enemies. Three faithful friends of her husband appear just at this time, who have formerly been acrobats in a circus, and they hit upon the plan of intertwining themselves lengthwise, and with tbeir interlocked bodies across the chasm make a bridge over which the mother and child escape. In the plot there ; are several very strong situations, where the principals, Joseph E. Pearce and Miss Carrie Rad cliffe, make the very best of their, op portunities. The support is good throughout, Dolly Harmer as "Pan cakes" and Willie Scott as "Nutty Brown," being irrisistibly funny. • Grand Opera House. There is no question about the fact that the magnet this week at the Grand is Lottie Collins, and it is also a fact that after the people go that they are not only entertained by Miss Collins, but also by the very clever vaudeville performance given by the Howard Athenaeum company, Schafer, the equilibrist being beyond a doubt a won der; in fact, the entire entertainment is one . that may be truthfully pro nounced most excellent of its kind. # -;--■ •"'■- After a long absence Vernona Jarbeau returns to us, commencing next Sunday night at the Grand.

OPINIONS ON THE MESSAGE. The London Press. Z The London ; Daily News tomorrow will say of President Cleveland's mes sage: The message is well worthy, of the national crisis in which?- it is deliv ered. v * ' The : ; inference . • from ? '.] ; Mr. Cleveleland's facts and figures, whether he intended it or not, is that is the true policy to cultivate close rela tions,with us. It seems generally agreed that the new t tariff proposals' will not largely affect our trade with the United States. .... .... . . - ..-:....,}, London Chronicle "will say: In the references to Brazil' and tlie Beliriqg sea in* Presideut . Cleveland's message, there is nothing that might not have been fathered by President Harrison. It? is otherwise with the reference to. Hawaii.: Vln ".' awaiting Mr. Cleveland's decision, : the . friction that : would" probably have : been caused there by interference at the time has. been avoided, but. the result is tim same. With regard to the reform of the tariff, the Chronicle says that while the president will have the good wishes of every sound economist in the battle he has begun, it would be premature to re gard it as already won because the big gest battalions are at present on his side? The London. Telegraph in its com ments tomorrow morning upon Presi dent's Cleveland's message will say: The portion of the message which displays President Cleveland at. his best is his reference .. to Hawaii. Such a frank aud 'honest admis sion of a mistake, ., and the declar ation of his intention to reverse it re flects the highest possible credit upou the president, and indirectly upon the nation also. The president was evi dently convinced* that the American public would be magnanimous enough to uphold his action, and he was prob ably right in so thinking. The London Morning Post will say: President Cleveland's abstention from party rhetoric is all the more creditable, as his opportunities for the employment of scathing invective were exceptional. The Post expresses surprise that the Hawaiian incidents are mentioned with out any expression of shame or indigna tion. ZZ'Z-ii . London Daily Graphic will say: 'Mr. Cleveland is to be congratulated upon his firmness and consistency. ',;-.-'; London Times will say: The message exhibits clear and well-reasoned views of policy, iv addition to much force of character. Mr. Cleveland does not take refuge, as so many of his predecessors have done, in timid temporizing and ambiguities. The por tions of the message bearing upon for eign affairs are conceived in a highly creditable spirit. Considering, the chauvinism of our American kinsfolk, it is the more creditable that the pres ideut has frankly admitted the wrong done . to Hawaii. Mr. Cleve land would doubtless be inclined to no a deal further than the Wilson bill, but he recognizes that the obstacle to prog ress caused by a deficit in the Wilson bill would benefit American working men and place manufacturers upon something like a level with their for eign competitors. Whether these changes " in the long run will benefit British industry and trade is doubtful. ' The London Standard will say tomor row: President Cleveland stood like a rock. No words could be clearer and no attitude could be sounder from an American standpoint. The president and his cabinet have chosen a battle ground with remarkable shrewdness. In our opinion they will carry the new tariff measure with less* difficulty than • they did the ; repeal of . the silver purchasing clause of the Sher man act. From our point of view, and iv spite of Mr. Cleveland's attitude to wards England, we might almost regard, the proposed new tariff as the work of an enemy. Its natural consequence is to create a new competitor for our busi ness abroad, and we can only hope that experience aiul the benefit of cheap raw materials may lead to better things in other directions. *:?-•'- " "'. What Is Said. in. Chicago. ?..,.?,? The Chicago Times (Dem.), in com menting on President Cleveland's mes sage*, will say: .-There is so much that is suggestive— more, perhaps, in manner, than in matter— in what Mr. Cleveland has to say about the Hawaiian situatiou that it may well be reprinted io full." After reproducing tne Hawaiian por tion of the message, the Times contin ues: "it is not necessary to read very closely between the lines to discover that if Mr. Cleveland ever made the de termination to replace the negro queen upon the throne, be has abandoned it. 'So tar as practicable,' Minister Willis is to endeavor 'to restore the status ex isting at the time ot : our forcible intervention,' but action is only to be taken • 'within the constitutional limits of executive pow er.' Here is a loophole wide enough for a fat man to waddle through, spacious enough to permit the bungling act of the reported scheme of the Cleveland- Blount- Wiilis triumvirate for the rein statement of the dethroned queen. The president is to be congratulated upon the astuteness with which he has laid out his lines of retreat from an unpopu lar and untenable position." The Inter Ocean (Rep.) says of the president's message: The message of this year is as commonplace as the oue of 1887 was sensational. It does advo cate free trade, but only with specific reference to the Wilson bill, which is cordially indorsed and made an admin istration measure. As to the Hawaiian affair he says that at latest accounts nothing had been done to undo the work of the last administration. - Wheu it has, he will let congress kuow about it.* '- This is very kind of him. Not a word of reference is made to the prohibitory tax on state bank notes. The free trade pledge must be carried out, but the wild-cat pledge was a bit of empty buncombe. The Record (Ind.) says: The motive of the message as a whole may be said to be economy. Concerning Honolulu the president says he will take congress into his confidence further on this mat ter. For the time ' being the nation is free to continue guessing as to methods by which an American minister Is to overthrow a foreign government diplo matically, aud iv a spirit of brother hood; Noted by New York Papers. *'" The New York World will say: The message deals more with details of the departments than with the principles of government and the policy of the ad ministration. The president commends the . moderate Wilson bill in its purpose to help manufacturers and labor by reducing the taxes on their necessities. His firmness and con servatism on the question were not un expected, and they will have a good effect. The message as a whole, while it will not add greatly to Mr. Cleve land's fame as a writer or a leader, is a sensible, sincere, patriotic document. - The New York Morning Advertiser, commenting on the president's message, will say: Upon the whole, it does not carry with it much that will encourage American people or reassure them on the apprehensions that sprang up when the Democratic, party was put in control of our national affairs last fall. The people know what they may ex pect. A great fight is before them. Headed by the president himself the free traders will make a desperate effort to pass the Wilson bill,. while it is not a free trade measure, has in it the men ace to the extinction of -'our industries which all have feared. : - The Tribune says: r The president surprises in what he says and in what he does not say. Bad as the Wilson bill is, the president commends it as ". the • ; fruit ■of "much patriotic and unselfish - work," believed that it "deals with the subject as consistently and thoroughly as existing conditions permit," and insists ..that-, the people have ordered congress to make a radical change in the tariff, and that "failure will be clear recreancy" to duty. * " ' ; The Herald :-■ saj-s : The '. dominant note of the president's message sent to congress ' yesterday "13 -; -prompt tariff revision. All .other matters are sub ordinated to this, which: Mr.' Cleveland properly -; regards'" as,?; now the over shadowing issue r before ; congress .'. and the country. •-- -.*. ."The- Recorder^ says: The message Is at once an; apology, a plea for, pardon and an entreaty. .The old ringing words Of command are all missing. The fact is, the terrific lessons of ! the November elections are : riugiug in his. ears. .The condemnation of the - people stunned him, and palsied his pen. ' Z h Z. Written in tec. Louis.

" llf the message outlines any special policy, it Is that he will be content from the hour when his pen traces the name of.Grover Cleveland at the bottom of a tariff reform bill, to be judged by his countrymen as au administrator. >,';?. : St. Louis Globe-Democrat (Rep.) will say of President Cleveland's message to . congress: lt is on the whole a clear, well-written and business-like document, and, except on the Hawaiian and tariff questions, will prove fairly satisfactory to the country. . The Ha waiian matter is destined to make trouble .for the administra tion, and Mr. Cleveland appears to have a foreboding of this, but he proposes to adhere to the policy which he has marked out for himself.' His. views on the financial question are wide. It is too soon to judge accurately what sort of legislation the suspension of silver purchases will make necessary, but we should, as he advises, "resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, determined to be content with nothing less than a lastiiig.compre heiisive plan.". '«, z-'Z-xx-zZi iX-Zi From the Silver Papers. Tho Denver Evening Times, speaking editorially of President Cleveland's message, says: Weighed in the bulance of the interests of the people, the presi dent is found wanting. The present financial laws appear to suit him, ex cept that a little more . should be done for. Wall street and the single standard. He suggests that the secretary or" the treasury be given more-authority the matter of forced issues, and that an official may issue bonds whenever Wall street demands it.regardless of all other interests and conditions. ■ He swallows the Wilson bill regard less of the November verdict. _, There are wise suggestions in the ■ message. The Times does not blindly condemn it as a whole, but holds that in matters nearest the breasts and interests of the people Mr. Cleveland favors the few rather than the masses. ■ fZ-^Y The Denver Republican will say to morrow editorially: If President Cleveland acted in good faith when he cited that measure, (the silver repeal bill) he should have taken occasion in this message to congress to urge the en actment of legislation that would make good the bi-metailic declaration of the the repeal bill; but inasmuch as -it is evident now, as it has been all along, that he regarded that declaration as mere boncombe, well-informed citizens will not be surprised as his latest utter ances on this subject. ; -f-Zf,f --,* The Republican will say there is every liklihood that the facts in the Hawaiian case will justify the position assumed by the 'aamistration and wiil declare the president destrojs his argu ment in favor of the Wilson -bill when he says: "The local interests affected by the promised reform are so. numer ous' and varied that if " all ate insisted upon, the legislation embodying the re form must inevitably fall." -1~ zi,-'-'. The .Washington Papers. . The Evening"* Star (lnd.) says: The president's message, containing about 13.000 words, and most comprehensive in its treatment of national affairs.is not in; any sense a medium: of surprises. By most Democrats it will be weii re ceived and lauded; Republicans will endeavor to belittle it; people of inde pendent ideas will praise that which is good and condemn freely the unsound. Like other presidential documeuts em anating from Mr. Cleveland, it has in it phrases that will be in use when more important portions of the message have been forgotten. ; if:%iZ: Washington Evening News (Ind.) says, in part; On some important matters his recommendations will be a disappointment. The country has not agreed with the administration on the Hawaiian question, and is not likely to be converted by anj thing in the mes sage.. On the currency question the message is excellent and sound to the core. . The president writes sensibly, on the tariff, recognizing the necessity for action, while suggesting that changes must not be necessarily hard nor unfair. Iv the recommendation for small and if possible temporary income tax, the president evidently appreciates the un popularity of such a measure. It is to be regretted that he does not urge economic rather than income tax, how ever small. 'ff- -iff In Kansas City. Kansas City Star (Ind.) says: The message of President Cleveland is such a document as his friends and support ers expected from him ; and, it may be added, that it is also such as his ene mies and opposers feared. Not a sen tence in his message is susceptible of a double construction. What the presi dent means, he says. Kansas City Journal (Rep.) say: There are only three things that the public looked for '.n the president's message with interest.

FULL OK FIGHT. * ■ "' ■--•---. Novel Naval Battle Expected in Brazilian Waters. . St. Thomas,, West Indies, Dec. ■_.—.'. As this dispatch is sent, the Brazilian cruisers Nictheroy, Capt. Baker, and and America. Capt. Crossmau, are pre paring to sail under sealed orders for some port in Brazil. :. -„ i.liffx The Nictheroy arrived here Monday. Nov. 27, and steamed outside Tuesday, and Thursday, where some * excellent Hotehkiss target practice was done. The gun crews handled the? new weapons in the most admirable manner^ . . Oneofthe Nictheroy's seamen, Fred erick § Martin, died of pneumonia and will be buried ashore. The America arrived here yesterday, after a rough trip, and both vessels", are expected to weigh anchor tonight and head for the coast of Brazil. The offi cers and crews both of the Nictheroy and the America feel fulljof fight and • most anxious for a brush with the enemy. Cable messages are said to have been exchanged here between the command ers of the Brazilian cruisers and the home authorities, and they are said to have been notified that Admiral de Mello has left Rio de Janeiro in order to meet the two ships. This has caused all the more enthusiasm among the crews of the Nictheroy and the America. Their destination is a secret, and, it is reported, that they will not be allowed to communicate with the shore. It is doubtful when any further news of President Peixoto's two cruisers will be forwarded to the United States. . The Associated Press correspondent on board the Nictherov has been well treated by the officers of the ship, and anticipates witnessing the most novel naval battle in the history of maritime warfare. t ,m ' 

KOSANKE INQUEST. The Coroner's Jury Have Not Reached a Verdict. ?.■?. Little Falls, Minn., Dec. 4.— vestigation since the arrest of Welter for the murder of Kosanke shows that he had quite a drinking bout on Friday night, and spent several dollars of the kind of money that Kosanke had been saving, such as pennies, souvenir pieces ana old dated coins. Some blood was found on Welter's clothes. r A brother of Kosanke arrived from St. Paul last night and returned with the remains today. The coroner's inquest is now in progress. The autopsy shows shows that either of the three methods employed in killi-ig Kosanke would have been fatal. Either the blows on the had, the stuffing of the handkerchief down the throat or the strangling with tiie rope would produce death". The remains of Albert R. Kosanke, who was murdered Friday night while at work in his harness-making shop at Little Falls, were brought to St. Paul, yesterday. The body was taken to the undertaking rooms of PierreGodbout,4S9 Wabasha street. A brother of the mur dered man. who resides at the corner of Martin street and Western avenue, went o Little Falls and brought the body to his city. PRINCETON CELEBRATES. Victorious Football Team Given a . Great Reception. Princeton, N. J., Dec. 4.— 01 d Nas sau's campus is wild with excitement tonight. Early in the evening a big procession was formed. The seniors drew the victorious football team in a large tally ho draped in orange and black, while a wagon : loaded with - fireworks preceded the parade, filling the air with their brilliant lights at short intervals. The music of the bands could scarcely be heard for the cheers and songs. About a dozen banners floated in the air bearing the score, slurs on Harvard and the University of Pennsly vania. and the names of the members of the championship team. Many promi nent alumni were present and made short addresses,congratulating the team, the students and the college. The crowd then gathered for the bon fire. The twenty-five cords of - hard wood, together with the lighter material, arose in the air as high as the elm trees about the campus. Capt. Trenchard started the great conflagration, and then arose such a din that one could scarcely hear himself think. The members of the team were cairied on the shoulders of the students around and around the fire, and the .old campus fairly roared with the yelling, cheering and fireworks. Sale orThoroujchbreds.

MADE FAMOUS IN A NIGHT. ' TWO MINNEAPOLIS SLEUTHS DISCOV- j ERED IN DISGUISE. \ REPORTERS GIVE SNAP AWAY. j Sheriff Ege and Winn Brackett Register at the Ktobitt Under ' Assumed Names, and, After a ' Night's Rest, Find Themselves , : the Newspaper Wonder of the j Day. Special to the Globe. i Washington, Dec. 4.— The solemn secrecy, the mysterious ; dignity of the modern American citizen who assumes the duties of a detective, are as amusing to the average citizen as the comicali ties of the opera bouffe. I Jim Ege is the sheriff of Hennepin county, an old soldier with a record.who has been twice elected to that office merely because he was a good fellow hot because he was smart, or cunning, or a deep thinker, or a trained intellect ual athlete, or even an educated detec tive—but solely, and only because he was generous, kindly, sympathetic, and loved the boys. Then there is Win Brackett. Win is a somewhat greater man than Jim, and yet his overshadowing fame and sur passing renown also culmiuated in an election to the same offico of sheriff of Hennepin county six years . ago. Since that Mr. Brackett has been chief of police and general manager of the ex position in Minneapolis, and has grown in grace as in greatness. Last Thursday night two tall and suspicious-looking gentlemen, bearing unmistakable evidences in their toilet of their origin in the wild and woolly West, sneaked furtively off a railroad "train and crept cautiously up the dark . and disreputable side of Pennsylvania . avenue to Four teenth street. They wore slouched hats pulled down over their eyes in a secret and sinister manner. They had each a grip. It would be hard for the trained guardians of the public peace to tell whether these men were burglars or detectives. . These two classes, to the innocent, have the same mannerisms. i They crept cautiously into the Ebbit house by the ladies' entrance. After peering arouud cautiously, and looking suspiciously at the hotel loafers in the office, one of them stood guard while the other approached the counter and registered— in a bold, bad hand: "M. W. Bartlett, St. Louis. "Henry E. James, Chicago!" Then Mr. Bartlett beckoned the clerk aside cautiously, and handed him a card upon which was written: ' "James H. Ege, "W. M. Brackett, Miuneapoiis." -•Sh-h-h!" he hissed. -"We have reg istered under an assumed name. If any mail comes for -these names send it up to our room '?'-:* The poor clerk was startled, not to say scared. Ten minutes after a Globe representative entered the Ebbitt. The clerk was pale. "Say !" he whispered, "do you know these stiffs?" and he exhibited the card. "Yes." "Who are , their nibs?" "Harmless— entirely innocuous— good citizens of a very reputable little town out in my country. Why?" "Hush-h-h!" whis pered the clerk. "They're up stairs in No. 002." "Well, what of it? 1 don't think they will rob your guests. They don't plunder nights, anyhow. What jobs they put up are all done in the day time. They have a fairly good reputation out home." "I don't like their ; looks. They have the appearance of running away from somebody. They look scared", like." : "Well," keep your eye on them.-. These are queer times. There are lots of defaulters nowadays. Watch 'em." Then the reporter, with the memory of cute Frank Nye. of Minneapolis, strolled out and notified all Newspaper row that Jim and Win had come, that they were in No. 902 at the Ebbitt, and that the clerk had mistaken them for burglars who burgled. Next morning their names, their er rand, their personal appearance— the entire snap appeared in the press re ports of the whole country, and they awoke to immortal fame. While they slept the sleep of the just the telegraph was notifying the universe that Sheriff Ege and ex-Sheriff Brackett were in Washington intent on getting papers from the state department to make a winter's trip to Honduras for the arrest of Menage. Before noon of the next day Menage's friends had telegraphed him that the sleuths were again in full bay; and that, as usual, they were accompanied by a brass band, a hand organ, a battery of Catling guns, four bass drums, six bull terriers and a pack of bloodhounds. There is nothing the modern detective really enjoys so much as plenty of ad vertising. It conduces to tame; it brings business; it adds to the amount of the fees; it makes them celebrated. It is a little expensive tor the taxpayers, per haps, but then the money is well ex pended, it it adds to" the over shadowing reputation of the detectives. Of course the capture of Menage is a matter of secondary importance. "God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform." Being against Menage and his methods the Almighty will somehow see to it that the princely scoundrel is meted out justice in the end. But evidently it will not be through the agency of the amateur de tectives—who are fitted tor almost any duty in life except to detect. AFTER -MENAGE. The Minneapolis sleuths Start on Their Trip for Gautemala. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 4. — Sleuths Brackett and Ege, of Minneapolis, took their departure for the South tonight at 10:40, it is supposed for New Orleans direct, although they gave it out on Newspaper row that they were bound for St. Louis in search of Slim. They, visited tbe state department two or three times today, terminating their final in terview, which was a long one, about 5 p.m. They were reticent "as ever, and the state department officials declined to be interviewed. There seems no reason to doubt their entire errand in Washington was to secure extradition papers for Menage. That they procured them is also probable.
