Bxpreun TUnnki of Coiitii-emi and American People to Seliley and His ••Men lor Victory nt SantlaKO— Sclilcy'N Attorney lliiHy Preparing XJill of Objections. Washington, Dec, 18.—Representa tive Wheeler, of Kentucky, has in troduced in the house a resolution to investigate the conduct of Rear Admiral Schley from the time he took command of the flying squad ron up to and including the destruc tion of the Spanish fleet, July 3, 1898. It recites the action of the court, of inquiry and declares the Ameri can people desire an investigation by citizens not connected with the navy department. Another Resolution. Representative Mudd, of Maryland, also introduced a resolution relative to Admiral Schley us follows: "Resolved, That the thanks of congress arid of the American people are hereby ten dered to Rear Admiral Wlnfield Scott Schley and the officers and men under his command for the-ir victory over the Span ish forces and the destruction of the Span ish fleet In the naval battle off Santiago de Cuba, July 3, 1898." Mr. Mudd says the resolution is not the result of any concerted action by the Maryland delegation and repre sents his individual views. Two democrats, Messrs. Yandiver (Mo.) and Cooper (Tex.), attempted to interrupt Chairman l'ti^ne in his motion that the house go into com mittee of the whole for considera tion of the Philippine tariff bill with wMfUAsts for unanimous consent to consider Schley resolutions, but Mr. Payne declined to yield. Mr. Cooper's resolution declared Schley in command and entitled to credit for the victory at Santiago and directed that he be placed on the active list with the rank he held be fore retirement. Mr. Vandiver's resolution recites that the language of the court of in quiry reflected upon Admiral Schley and calls for an investigation by seven members of the house, which shall investigate what injustice has been done and whether envy, jealousy or other factional feelings exist among naval officers and what remely should be applied. Preparing IH11 of Objection!!. Washington, Dee. 18.—Hon. Isidor Rayner and Mr. 'league, counsel and assistant counsel, respectively, for Admiral Schley during the court of in quiry, have gone to Baltimore, and are busily engaged in that city with the preparation of the statement of objec tions to the court's findings which Ad miral Schley has been granted permis 'Bion to file with the reviewing author ity, Secretary Long. This work is ex pected to occupy them for several days. Senator McComas, of Maryland, called at the navy department Tues day and had a long talk with Secretary Long before the latter departed for the cabinet meeting. It is understood that the senator came to the depart ment for the purpose of securing an ex tension by several days of the time al lowed by Secretary Long for the sub mission of the statement if it appears that the admiral's counsel cannot prop erly prepare their document in time. Representative Norton, of Ohio, Tuesday introduced a resolution pro posing the restoration of Admiral Schley to the active list. Long? Gives More Time. Secretary Long Tuesday afternoon informed Senator McComas that he would grant Admiral Schley's attor neys an extension of 24 hours from the time originally allowed them for the submission of their statement. This will make the time expire Thursday at four o'clock. Stayton and Moore, who appeared before the court of inquiry as attor neys for Admiral Sampson, have ap plied to Secretary Long for permission to be heard in protest against the ap proval by the secretary of the minority report written by Admiral Dewey and appended to the majority report of the court of inquiry. The secretary has consented to receive any papers they may care to submit. "aow An Toar KMMIII j/. THE MARKETS. Grain, Provision*, Etc. Chicago, Dec. 17. WHEAT—Dull early but turned strong.
