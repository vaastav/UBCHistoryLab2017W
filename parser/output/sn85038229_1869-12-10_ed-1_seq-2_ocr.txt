PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. , ..TotS StrmU and Hoh4 of Beprtmvtativts: Gzntlmicn: in coming beiore you for the tirst time as Chief Magistrate of this great , JV auon, it is nth gratitude to toe uiver all food for (be many benefits we erjoj ' blessed with psace at home and without en tangling alliance abroad to forebode trouble with a territory unsurpaaied in fertility, of 1 an aara equal to tbe abundant support of500, ;, ouvJUU of people, and abounding in a-varj variety of neclul mineral in quantity aumci eat the world for ifenerationa; with atrundan cropi; with a variety of climate adapted to the production of every species of earth'i richest productions; and suited to the habit and requirements of every living thine ' with a population of 40,000.000 of free peo ple, all apeaktng one language, with lacil ities lor erery mortal te acquire an eauca '' lion: with institutions cloainj to none the i avenue to lama or any blessing of fortune that may be coveted; with freedom of the pulpit, press and tbe school; with a revenue flooding into the Kational Treasury all th . requirements of Got era meet support, bar- . tnony is being rapidly restored within our own borders; manufactures hitherto on- known to our country, are springing up in - aU direct, producing a- aerree el nation -: i ai Iodependainee nnequsUed by that of anj other power. These blessing, with countless others am intrusted to vour rare and mine for sale i keeping for the brief period of our terms of : : office, in a snort time, we must each return . to lbs ranks of tbe people, who hare con f erred on ns our honors and account to them -' for oar stewardship. I earnestly desire that neither you oor 1 may be condemned by free and enlightened constituency, nor by - our own conscience. Emerging from a reballiun of gigantic magnitude, added, as it was, by the sympa - thy and assistance of nations with whch we ; wens at a pesos, eleven Sutei ef tbe Union vers four years sgo left without legal Elate Government. A. debt bad been contracted American commerce was almost driven from ' the seas: the industry of one half of the country had been taken from the control . the capitalist .and placed where all labor rightfully belongs in tbe keening of the la borer: the work of restoring State Govern men ts loyal to tbe Union, of protecting and ; foa taring free labor and providing means foi paring the interest on tbe public debt, hat received ample attention from Uoogross. At ' though yonr efforts have not met with the success is all particulars that -might have - been desired, yet, osi the whole, they, have , beea mere succesful than could have been reasonably anticipated. Seven Statea which passed ordinances of secession hsve been lully restored to voetr places in toe union The Eeurhth (Georgia) held an election ai which she ratified her constitution (Repub lican in form,) elected a governor, members of Congress, a State legislature, ana ai other officers required. The governor ws duly installed, tbe legislator met and per ' . formed all the acts required of them by tbe reconstruction sets of Uongres. Buoae- quently, however, in violation of the cocsti tution which they had just ratified, ss since - decided by tbe Supreme Court of tbe State. they excluded the colored1 members of the legislature and admitted to seats some mem ban who ere disqualified .by the third clause ol the fourteenth amesdment to tneeoosutu tioB, an article which they themselves hsd contributed to ratify. Under these circum stances, I would submit to you whether i would not be wise without delay to en set i law authorising the Governor of Georgia to - convene the members originally elected to the Legislature; requiring ech member to take the oath prescribed by the reconstruc tion act and none to be admitted who are ineligible under tbe third clsuse of the 14th amendment. ' ' - The freed men. under the protection which tTit'V have receivtd, are making rapid pr great; in learning, and no complaints are heard et lack of industry oo their part, when they receive lair remuneration lor tbeir la bor. The means provided for paying Interest on the public debt, with all other expenses ol government, are more man ampie. The loss of our commerce is tbe only re sult of the late rebelion which has not receiv ed sufficient sttention from you. To this ' subject I call your earnest attention -srili not bow suggest plans by which this - -. object may be effected, but will, if necessary .. make it tbe subject of a special message during lbs sessions of Uoneress. At tbe March term, Congrets, by joint resolution, authorised the executive to order . elections In the States of Virginia. Mississip pi, and Texas, to submit to them the con stitutions which each had previously in eon- ' vention framed, and submit the constitution either entire or in separate psrta to be voted upon ai toe discretion oi soe x-iecouve. . nder this authority elections were called n Virginia the election took place on tbe 6 h July, ISb!!. The Governor and l,ieut Governor elected hsve been installed. Tbe Legislature met and did all required by this resolution and by all the reconstruction act of Congress, and abstained trom all doubuul authority I recommend that her Senators and Representatives, be admitted to seats is Congress and hat tbe Stale be fully re etoifd to it place in the family of Slates. Elections were called in Mississippi and Texas, te commence on the 30th of Novem ber, 1889, and to last two dsys in Mississip pi and four days in Texas. The elections have taken place, but the result is not known it is to be hoped that the acta of the Legis lates of these States, when tbey meet, will be such as to leceive your approval, and thus close the work of reconstruction. Among the evils growing out of the re bellion and not referred to, isthstofan irre oeemable currency. It it an evil which 1 hope will receive your most earnest attention It is duty, and one of tbe highest duties ol the Government, to secure to tbe citizens s medium of exchange of fixed, unvarying value. This impliea a return to a specie basis, snd no substitode for it esn lie devil ed. It ahould be commenced now aod reach ed at the earliest practicable moment con sistant with a fair regard to the intern of ths debtor class. Immediate resumption " if practicable, wonld not be desirable. It would compel the debtor class to pay beyond (heir contracts the premium of gold at the date of their purchase, and would bring bankruptcy and rntn te thonsands. fluctuation, bowever, ia the paper value of tbe measure of all val ues, (gold,) Is detrimental to the in Uresis ol trade. It makes the man of buainesa an in voluntary gambler; for in all sales when future payment ia to be made, both parties peculate as to what will be the value ol tbe currency to be paid and received. I earnestly recommend to you, then, such legislation as will insure a gradual return te specie payments snd put sn immediate atop in the value of currency. Tbe methods to secure these results are ss numerous as are the speculations of political economy. To secure the latter, I see but one way, and that is to authorize the Treasury to redeem jsut own paper at a fixed price whenever pre aenJod, and to withhold from circulation all sucb currency redeemed until sold again for gold. Tne vast .resources of the nation, both developed aeat undeveloped ought to make our credit tbe b'et on earth. With a lees burden of taxation then the citizen hsd endured for six yeara past, the entire pub lie debt could be paid in ten years; but it ia not desirable that ths people should now be taxed to pay it in that time, Ye?r by year tbe abillity to pay increases in a rapid ratio; but tbe burden oi interest ought to be reduced aa rapidly aa can be done without th, violation of contact. The public debt ia leo.'esented in a great part by bonds, hav ing trom ve to twenty and from ten to forty yaaia to run, beajit-g interest at tbe rate ol cer cent., ana hve per cent, respectively It ia optional with the Government to pay their bonds at any period after the expiration Or Uie lasi uuiv iuoiiiauusu vyvu iucu The time haaalreadly expired when a great nart of them mar be taken np, 103 lime is rapidly approaching when all may be.

Tbe estimates for the ensuing yesr ars far more favorable to tie gGrernment and f ill no ttou.pt hw a larjra decrrf H of the i in a the public de"bt The receipts in the public debt Tbe receipts in the Treasury beyond expen ditures have exceed the amount necessary to be placed te the credit of the sinking fund as provided by law. To lock up tbe surplus in the Treasury and withhold it from circu lation, wonld lead to such eoutrsrtiea of eav rency as to cripple trade and seriously affect the prosperity of the count y. Under these circumstances, the Secretary of the Treasury and myself heartily concurred in tre pro priety of using all the surplus currency it ibe Treasury in the purchase of Government bonds, thoa reducing the Interest bearing debt of the country and of substituting to Oengretti tbe question of disposition to b made of the bonds so purchased. The bonds now held by the Treasury amount to about $75,000,000, including those belonging to the sinking fund, and recommend that tbe whole be placed to the credit of the sinking fund. 1 our attention is respectfully invited to the reeesna eadaiioa ef the Secretary f the Treasury for the creation of tbe office of Com mtmoner of Customs Kevenue; lor the in crease of salary to certain clames of officials, (or tbe substitution of increased national bonds to replace the outstanding joint eerti ficates; and most especiall to hit recommen dations for tbe repeal of Is wssllow ing shares of.fitea, penalties, forfeiture, ete., to officers ol tbe government or in termers. The office of Commissioner of Internal Re venue is one of the most arduous and respoo- sioie unaer tne uovemroenl. It tails but little, if any, short of a Cabinet position in its importance and responsibilities. 1 would ask tor it, therefore, such legislation at in yonr judgement will place the office on i footing of dignity commensurate with its itn portance and with tbe character and qualifi cations of the class of men required to fiill it properly. As the United Stabs ia the freest ef all nation, so, loo, its people sympathize with all people struggling for liberty and self- govemorent. But while so svmnathiEinc. it is due to our honor that we should absta in from enforcing our views upon unwilling nations, and from taking an interested part, without invitation, in the q uarrela bstweea different nations, or between governments snd their subjects. Our cause should be in conformity with strict justice and law, inter national and local. Such has been the pol icy of the administration ia dealing with these questions. For mere tbaa a year, a valuable province of Spain, and a near neigh bor of ours, in whom all our people cannot bat feel a deep interest, has been strugliog for independence aad freedom. The people and government oi tne United stales may yet prove advantageous for the settlement of his unhappy stiife. . Meanwhile s number of illegal expeditions sgainat Cuba bare been brekon up. it has beea the endeavor of the Administration to execute the .Neu trality lawa in good faith, no matter ho unpleasant the task, msde so by the suffer ing we bsve endured from lsck of like good faith toward na by other nations. Our peo ple entertain the earn warm feelings and sympaihiee for the people of Cuba in their pending atruggle that they manHisted throughout the previous struggle between Spain and her former coloniea in behalf of 'be latter; but the contest st no time sssum ej the conditions which smount to a war, in the sense of international law, or wich would show tbe existence of a de facto poiit ieal organistlicn of ths insurgents sufficient to justify a recognition of belligerency. Tbe principle is maintained, bowever, that this nation ia its own judge when to accord the right of beligerency, either to a people struggling to Iree tbemselves Iron a govern menl they believe to be oppressive, or to in dependent nstioos at war with each other. The United Statea have no disposition to inlerftre with the existing relationa ofSpain to ber Uolooial poeaessiona on tbis continent. They believe tbat in due time 8,-ain and other European powers will find their interest e terminating those relations and establish ing tbeir present dependencies as independ ent powers or members of the family of nations. These dependencies are no lorger regarded as subject to transfer from sue ,uropeon power to another.- n hen ,thi preseul relatione of oolooies ceases, tbey are to be come independent pjwera, exercising ibe right ol choice and ol soil-control m the drtsmiiostioo ol their future coudilion and relations with other powers. I he United states in order to put a stop to bloodshed in Cula, and in the interest of a neighboring ptoplr.proposed their goodoftices to bring tbe existing cot test to a termination. The oner not being accepted by Spam oo a basis which ws believed could be received by Cuba, waa withdiawn. It is hoped that tbe good onice soi ue i . a. to bring about a peace between bpaio and tne aoutb Americn Republics, with which she is at wsr, having been aeoeptad by Spain, Tern and Chili, a Congress has bean inrited to be held in Wash ington duiing the present winter. Tbe question of the seizure of the brig Mary Lowell at one of the Bahama Islands. by Spsinsh authorities, is now the subject ol correspondence between this government and those of Spain and Great Biitain. The Cap tain General of Coba, about May last, issued a proclamation authorizing search to be made of veaalea on tbe high seas Immediate remonstrance waa made against this where- nan, the Captain General issued a new proclamation, limiting the right of aearch ol vessels of the United States, so far as author ized nader the treaty of 17115. This waa withdrawn. I have alwaya felt that ton most intimate relations should be cultivated between the Republic of tbe United States snd ell inde pendent nations on tbis continent. It msy be well worth considering whether new trea ties between the United Stales aod them may be profitably entered into to secure more in timate relatione, friendly, commercial and otherwise. ' The subject of an internatiousl-oceanicca- i nal, to coucect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Isthmus of Darien, ia one n which commerce is greatly interested. Instrufiiona have been givea to aur mi Lister to the hVepupinc ol (be United States of Co lamb'.a, to endeavor to obtain 'authority for a survey by this government in order to de termine the practicability of sucb an under taking, and a cba ter fur the right of way to build by private enterprise such wort, n tbe survey proves it to be practicable. In order to comply srith tbe agreement of tne united outes toa mixea commission to Lima, lor tbe abtuatment of claimaa, it be came necessary to send a commissioner to Lima in August last. An appropriation having been made by Uongress for tbis pur pose, it is now asked that one be made cov ering the past and future expenses of the commission. A grsnt haa been given to Kurepeans ol an exc uaive rigbt oi transit over tbe territo ry of .Niearagna, to whica Costa Kica haa ivea its assent, which, it ia alleged, con- dicta with vested light of cit zens of tbe Uni ted States. The Department of State bas pow this subject under consideration. ' ibe minister ot 1'eru Having made renre aeotations that there was a state of war bc- ween Peru and Spiin, and tbat Spain was constructing fa or uear Kw lork thirty gunboats, which might be used by Spain in such a way as to isUes-a tbe pars) force at Cubs, so aa to operate sgaipst Cui)t, orders were given to prevent tbeir departure. 2to further steps having been taken by the re: presentative pi the Peruvian Government to prevent the departure pi these vessels, and 1 not feeling authorized to detain the pro perly of a nation with which we are at peace on a nwre executive order, the matter has been reforred to the courts to decide. The conduct of the wsr between tbe Alies and Kepuplic of Paraguay, has made th lo tercouise with that country so difficult that it has been deemed advisable to withdraw our .Representative from tbem. Towards thn close of tbe last Ad-ni listra tiou, a Convention was signed at London for the settlement of sll outstanding claims be tween great iiritup snd tbe L i ited States, which tailed to receive the adtjre and con sent of the Senate to its ratification. Tbe lime aod the circumstances attending the negotiation of the traaty weie favorable lo its acceptance by the peonlu of the United Stales, and its provisions were wholly ina. dtquate for tbeUseulement of tbe grave wrongs that had been sustained by this Gov ernment, as well as by its citizens. Tbe in juries resulting to the United States by rea son ol tbe course adopted by Great .Britain during our late civil war; in increased ratio of insurance; in tbe diminution of expoita and imports and other obstructions to domes tie industry and production; it its effect upon tbe foreign commerce of tbe country; in tbe decn-aie and transfer to Great Britain of our commeicial marine; in the prolonga tion of ear end increase 1 cost both in treas ure and in livea iti i!e spppresaioo, could not be adjusted and tattsnea as ordinary com mercial clainie which continually ai iae be tween commercial nations; and yet, the Ovn- j vention treated them simply as sucb ordinary I claims, from which they d.ffur more widely in their character than in the magnitude ' their amount, great, even, as is thatamount. Not a word was found in tbe treaty aod not an mlerence could be drawn from it and re move tbe ground of unfriendliness of the course of Great BritUin io our struggle for existence, which had so deeply aod univer sally impressed itself upon ths people of this country. Believing that a Convention thus misconceived in t scope end made quite in its prorisiona, would not fcave produced ths hearty, cordial settlement of pending quea- nun, wnicn aiooe, is consisieut witn uib re lations, which, I much desire to have estab lished between the United Statea aod Great Britain, i regarded tbe action of the Senate the rejection of the treaty to have been wiaely taken ia the interest ef peace, and .as necessary step in tbe diiecliou of a perfect and cordial friendship hnlyeeu the two countries. A sensitive people, fonecjus of their power are more at ease nnder a great rung, wholly unatoned. than under tlie res traint of a settlement which satisfies neither thtir ideas of justice nor tbeir grave sense of gricTenca the jr hare luiUmed. 1 in is the to The rejection of the treaty wai followediyXi1 fcYtatc of public fueling on both aides which I thought not favorable to an immediate at tempt at renewed negotiations. I according ly instructed the ministerof tbe U. S ates Great Britain, snd found that my views in this regard, were shared by her majesty's minuter. I hope that tb lime may soon arrive, srhen the two govoruoients can ap proach tbe solution of ibis momentous q es tton wh an assurance of hat ia due to tbe rights, dignity and honor of each, and with the determination not only to reroo.e the csus of complaint in the past, hut 'ttt lay the Inundation ol a broad principle ol public law,' which will preveut future differences and tend to firm and continued friendship. This is now the only grave question which the U oi ted States have with any foreign, nation- !!.,( Ml ) The question of a treaty for teciprocity be tween tbe united statea and tne tSritisn pro vinces on tbie continent; has not been fa- ably considered bylhe administration. : Tbe advantage of snch a treaty will be wholly in favor of the British producer, except posi- bly a few engaged in the trade between the two. ...t , The repott of the Postmaster i jeneral ler nishea a clear and comprehensive exhibit of the operations of the postal service and df tbe financial condition of this part of the Post Office Department. Tbe ordinary postal rev enues for the yer ending 30i.h of June, 1S69 amount to $18,314,510 and the expenditures to $23, 69,131, showing an excess of expen ditures over tbe receipts of $6, 350 G0. The excess ol expenditures over receipts for tbe previous year amounted to $0,438, DG5.

From tbe founda'eon of Ibe Government to the present, the management of original iohab'urnts of this continent, the Indians, has been a sulj el of embarrassment aad expense and basbeoo attended with continuous rob beries, murders snd wars. From my own experience upbn the frontiers at d in Indian countries, I do not b Id eilher IpgWation or the conduct of tne whites who g ime most ia con1 act with ludians blameless for their hostilities. The pist, however, cannot be undone, and tbe q nest ion must be met as we now find it. - I have attempted a new policy towards these wards of the nation, (tbey can not be regerded in any other light ihm as wards.) with fair results so far aa tried, and which I hope will be attended ultimately with .great success. The Society of Friends is well known ss having succeeded in liying in peace with the Indiins in ths early set tlemept of Pennsylvania, while tbeir white neighbors of other aeeta in other sections were constantly embroiled, They are also knowa for.ttt t opposition lo aU strife, vLy lence and war. and are gecenlly noted for their atrict integrity and fair dealings. Thess eom-id'Tatjors ind need m.togi ve t he manage ment of a ttw te-ervatiooe of Indians to them, and to throw the bu'deo of selection of the agents upon the seoiety itself. Tbe result has proven moKt sat islactory . it will be found more fully set forth in the report of the commissiner of Indian affairs. For snperiutepdepts and Indian agetts- on reser vations, officers of the sriy ?-?re elected. The resume for this are numerous. When Indian agents are sett there or near there, trot p must be sent also. Tbe agent and commander of trorpi are independent of each other, and are subject to orders from the difl'eient Departimnts of tbe Uoveunieut. The army otfioer holds a position for life, the agent only at tbe will of the President The former is tersooally interested in living in harmony with he Indian and the establish ment of s permanent place, 10 the end that some portion of his life may be spent w'thiii the limits of civilized sections. The later haa no such personal interests. Another reason ia an economic one, and still another hold which the government has upon a life officer, to secure a faithful discharge of duties in cawvimr out a riven policy. ; The buildirg of Railtioads jnd the access thereby givei to all agricultural and mine- ral regions of our country is rapidly bring- ine civilized settlements into contact with all tribes of Indians. Afo matter wljat ought to be the relationa between sucn fetf .eruanta I Aboijgines, the fact is, they do not bar- mooize well; and one or the other has to give way in the end. A. system wbicu looks to the extermtna- tion of the raca, is too horrible for a nation adopt, without entailing upon itself the wrath ol ltiristecdom and endangering in I the citizen a iliiea,-d for hninaa life and the rights of others daigeroua to. sco:ety. see no ubsihute for si.cu a svsiem ticept I in placing all the Indiaus on large resiva- as r. p-dly ai can be d ne sud giving them sbsofute protection there.
