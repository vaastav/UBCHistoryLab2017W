It should be so declared by treaties among all civilised pow ers. The Trust Problem. 'The tremendous and hivhiv Industrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth century brings us face to face, at the beginning of the twentieth, with very serious social problems. The oi l laws, and the old customs which had almost the binding force of law, were once quie sufficient to regulate the accumuUtion and distribution of wealth. Since the industr nl changes which have so enormously Increased the productive power of mankind, they are uo The creation of ereat rnmnnfa er,-. has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental action, but to natural causes in the business world, operating iu other countries as they operate in our own "It Is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On thj contrary, never before has the average man the wage-worker, the farmer th m.u i er, been so well off as In this country an-1 at the present time. There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth; yei ii remains irue mat a fortune accumu lated only on condition of conferring im mense incidental benefits upon others. Suc cessful enterprise, of the type which benefits all mankind, can only exist if the conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the re wards of success. 'The caotalns of Induatrv whn h trivaH the railway systems across this continent, who have built up our commerce, who have developed our manufactures, have on the whole done great good to our people. With out them the material development of which we are so Justly proud could never have taken place. Moreover, we should recognize the Immense Importance to this material development of leaving as unhampered as is compatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whom the success of business operations inevitably rests. Cantlon Is Urged. An additional reason for caution in Ing with corporations is to be found in the International commercial conditions of to day. The same business conditions which have produced the great aggregations of cor porate and Individual wealth have made them very potent factors in International commer cial competition. America has only just begun to assume that commanding position in the international business world which we believe will more and more be hers. It is of the utmost importance that this position be not jeoparded, especially at a time when the overflowing abundance of our own natu ral resources and the skill, business energy, and mechanical aptitude of our people make foreign markets essential. Under such con ditions it would be most unwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our Nation. 'Disaster to great business en tero rises can never have Its effects limited to the men at the top. It spreads throughout, and while It is bad for everybody, it is worst for those farthest down. The capitalist mar be shorn of his luxuries; but the wage-worker may be deprived of even bare necessities. "in lacing new industrial conditions, the whole history of the world shows that legis lation will generally be both unwise and in effective unices undertaken after calm inquiry and with sober self-restraint. Much of the legislation directed at the trusts would have been exceedingly mischievous had it not also been entirely Ineffective. In dealing with business interests, for the government to un dertake by cruoe ana ill-considered legisla tion to oo wua; may turn out to be bad, would be to Incur the risk of such far-reaching national disaster that it would be prefer able to undertake nothing at all. "All this is true: and yet it is also true that there are real and grave evils, one of the chief being over-capitalization because of Its many baleful consequences; and a reso lute and practical effort must be made to correct these evils. Government S pervis ion. It Is no limitation upon DroDerty rights or freedom of contract to require that when men receive from government the privilege of doing business under corporate form, which frees them from Individual responsibility, and enables them to call into their enterprises the capital of the public, they shall do so upon absolutely truthful representations as to the value of the pn-perty in which the capi tal Is to be Invested. Corporations engaged In interstate commerce should be regulated If they are found to exercise a license work ing to the public injury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corpora tions exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions and it Is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work In harmony -with these insti tutions. Publicity Remedy for Trusts. The first essential In determinlns how to deal with the great industrial combinations is knowledge of the facta publicity. Xn the interest of the public, the government should ill 1 i 

BESS have the right to Inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in Interstate business. Publicity is the only sure remedy which we can now invoke. What further reraed.es are needed in the way of governmental regulation, or taxation, can only be deierm.ned after Dubhcitv has betfn obtained, by process of law, and in the course of administration. The first requisite Is Knowledge, tun and complete knowledge which may be made public to the world. "Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other associations, depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, snouia be subject to proper gov era mental supervision, and full and accurate information as to their operations should be maae puouc reguiany at reasonahie intervals. "The large corporations, common lv called trusts, though organized In one state, always uo Dullness in many states, orten doing very little business in the state where they are incorporated. There Is utter lack of uniform ity in the state laws about them: and as state has any exclusive interest In or powr over xneir acts, it nas in practice proved im possible to get adequate regulation through state action. Therefore, In the interest of the whole people, the Nation should, without in terfering with the power of the states In the matter itself, also assume power of super vision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate business. This is espe cially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency ia its nusiness. i nere would be no hardship tn such supervision banks are sublect to It. and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter or course, indeed. It is probable that supervision of corporations by the National government need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a state as Massachusetts, in order to produce excellent results. "I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the National government to exer cise control along the lines above indicated; profiting by the experience gained throuaii the passage and administration of the Interstate-Commerce Act. If, however, the Judg ment of the Congress is that it lacks the constitutional power to pass such an act, then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power. "There should be created a Cabinet officer. to be known as Secretary of Commerce and Industries, as provided in the bill introduced at the last session of the Congress. It should be his province to deal with commerce in Its broadest sense Including among many other things whatever concerns labor and all mat ters affecting the great business corporations ana our mercnant marine. Restriction on Immigration. "With the sole exception of the farming interest, no one matter is of such vital mo ment to our whole people as the welfare of the wage-workers. If the farmer and the wage-worker are well off, it Is absolutely certain that all others will be well off, too. It is therefore a matter for hearty congratu lation that on the whole wages are higher to-day in the United States than ever before in our history, and far higher than In any other country. The standard of living is also higher than ever before. Every effort of leg islator and administrator should be bent i secure the permanency of this condition of things and its improvement wherever possi ble. Not only must our labor be protected by the tariff, but it should also be protected so far as it is possible from the presence in this country of any laborers brought over by contract, or of those who, coming freely, yet represent a standard of living so de pressed that they can undersell our men In the labor market and drag them to a lower level. I regard it as necessary, with this end in view, to re-enact immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers and to strength en it wherever necessary in order to make its entorcement entirely eirective. "So far as practicable under the conditions of government work, provision should be made to render the enforcement of the eight hour law easy and certain. In all Indus tries carried on directly or indirectly for the United States government women and chil dren should be protected from excessive hours of labor, from night work, and from work under unsanitary conditions. "The most vital problem with which this country, and for that matter the whole civ ilized world, has to deal. Is the problem which has for one side the betterment of so cial conditions, moral and physical, in large cities, and for another Bide the effort to deal with the tangle of far-reaching questions which we group together when we speak of "labor.' Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wage-workers, when managed with fore thought, and when they combine insistence upon their own rights with law-abiding re spect for the rights of others. The display of these qualities In such bodies Is a duty to the Nation no lc?s than to the associations them selves. Finally, there must also in many cases be action by the government in order to safeguard tbe rights and interests of all. Under our Constitution there is much more scope for such action by tbe state and the municipality than by the Nation. But on points such as those touched on above the National goverumnt can act. "Our present immigration laws are unsa isfactory. We need every honest and em cent Immigrant fitted to become an Ameri can c'tizen. every immigrant who comes here to sta7, who bring3 here a strong body, a btout heart, a good head, and a resolute pur pose to do his duty well in every way and to bring up his children as law-abiding and God-fearing members of the community. But there should be a comprehensive law enact ed with the object of working a threefold im provement over our present system. First, we should aim to exclude absolutely not only ell persons who are known to be believers In anarchistic principles or members of an archistic societies, but also all persons who are of a low moral tendency or of unsavory reputation. This means that we should re quire a more thorough system of inspection abroad and a more rigid system of examina tion at our immigration ports, the former be ing especially necessary. "The second object of a proper immigra tion law ought to be to secure by a careful and not merely perfunctory educational test some Intelligent capacity to appreciate Amer ican institutions and act sanely as Ameri can citizens. This would not keep out all anarchists, for many of them belong to tbe intelligent criminal class. But it would do w- t is also in point, that is, tend to de crease the sum of ignorance, so potent in producing the envy, suspicion, malignant pasFion, and hatred of order, out of which anarchistic sentiment inevitably spring?. Finally, all persons should be excluded who are below a certain standard of economic fit ness to enter our industrial field as com petitors with American labor. There should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn an American living and enough money to In sure a decent start under American cond1 tions. This would stop the influx of cheap labor, and tbe resulting competition which gives rise to so much of bitterness in Ameri can industrial life: and it would dry up tho springs of the pestilential social conditions In our great cities, where anarchistic organ izations have their greatest possibility of growth. Qnettton of Reciprocity. "There Is general acquiesence In our pres ent tariff system as a national policy. Tbe first requisite to our prosperity is the con tinuity and stability of this economic policy. iNothing could be more unwise than to dis turb tho business interests of tbe country by any general tariff change at this time. Doubt, apprehension, uncertainty are exactly what we wish to avoid In the interest of our com mercial and material well-being. Our experi ence in tbe past has shown that -sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt to produce conditions closely approaching panic in the business world. Yet It is not only possible, but eminently desirable, to combine with the stability of our economic system a supple mentary system of reciprocal benefit and obli gation with other nations. Such reciprocity is an Incident and result of the firm estab lishment and preservation of our present economic policy. It was specially provided for In the present tariff law. "Our first duty is to see that the protection granted by the tariff in every case where it is needed is maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for so far as it can safely be done without injury to our home industries. Just how far this is must be determined accord ing to the individual case, remembering al ways that every application of our tariff pol icy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below tbe point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well-being of tbe wage-worker is a prime consideration of our entire policy of economic legislation. "Subject to this proviso of the proper pro tection necessary to our industrial well-beintf at home, the principle of reciprocity raut command our hearty support. The pheno menal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a liberal policy in dealing with for eign nations. Whatever is merely petty and vexatious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products Jn the long run, directly or indirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us some thing in return. Their ability to purchase our products should as far as possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to en able us to take from them those products which we can use without barm to our own Industries and labor, or tbe use of which will be of marked benefit to us. "We have now reached the point in the development of our interests where we are not only able to supply our own markets but to produce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets abroad. To secure these markets we can utilize existing duties In any case where they are no longer needed for the purpose of protction. or In any case where the article Is not produced here and the duty is no longer necessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer in exchange for what we ask. The cordial re lations with other nations which are so de sirable will naturally be promoted by the course thus required by our own interests. "The natural line of development for a poncy oi reciprocity will be in connection with those of our productions wbich no long- er require all of the support once needed j to establish them upon a sound basis, and with those otWers where either because of . natural or of economic causes we are beyond ! tbe reach of successful competition. ( reciprocity treaties laid before it by my pre decessor. unr jncrroaut marine. "The condition of the American merchant marine is such as to cail fcr immedia;e ! remedial action by the Congress. It Is dis creditable to us as a Nation that our mer- j chant marine should be utterly insignificant I in comparison to that -of other nations which ' we overtop In other forms of business. "American shipping is under certain great i disadvantages when put in competition with i the shipping of foreign countries. Many of ; the fast foreign steamships, at s speed of j fourteen knots or above, are subsidized; and all our ships, sailing vessels and steamers i alike, cargo carriers of slow speed and mail carriers of high speed, have to meet the fact that the original cost of building Ameri can ships is greater than is the case abroad: that the wages paid American officers and seamen are very much higher than those paid the officers and seamen of foreign competing countries; and that tbe standard of Uving on our ships is far superior to the standard of living on the shins of our commercial rival a. 'Our government should take such action as will remedy these Inequalities. The Amer ican merchant marine should be. restored to tne ocean. "The Act of March 14. 1900. Intended un equivocally to establish gold as the standard money and to maintain at s parity therewith all forms of money medium in use with us, bas been shown to be timely and Judi?ious. Tbe price of our government bonds in the world's market, when compared with tbe price oi similar obligations issued by other nations. Is a flattering tribute to our public creait. i nis conamon it is eminently desir able to maintain. "In many respects the National Banking Law furnishes sufficient liberty for the proper exercise of the banking function but there seems to be need of better safeguards against the deranging influence of commercial crises and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of the country should be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade and commerce. Redaction of Revenues. "The collections from duties on Imports and Internal taxes continue to exceed the ordi nary expenditures. The utmost care should be taken not to reduce the revenues so that tnre will be any possibility of a deficit; but, after providing against any such contingency. means should be adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit of our actual needs. "I call special attention to the need of strict economy in expenditures. The fact that our national needs forbid us to be niggardly in providing whatever Is actually necessary to our well-beine. should make us douhlv car. ful to husband our national resources, as eacn oi us nusDanas nis private resources, by scrupulous avoiaance or anytmng like waste ful or reckless expenditure. Regulation of Railroads. In 1S87 a measure was enacted for the reg ulation of interstate railways, commonly known as the Interstate Commerce Act. The cardinal provisions of that act were that railway rates should be just and reasonable ana mat an snippers, localities, and commo dities should be accorded equal treatment. A commission was created and endowed with wnat were supposed to be the necessary pow ers to execute the provisions of this act. "That law was largely an experiment. Ex perience has shown the wisdom of its pur poses, but has also shown, possibly that some of its requirements are wrong, certainly that the means devised for the enforcement of its provisions are defective. "The act should be amended. The railway is a public servant. Its rates should be just to ana open to all Bbippers alike. The gov ernment should see to it that within its juris diction this is so and should provide a speedy, inexpensive, and effective remedy to that end. At the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblood of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the en actment of legislation which would unneces sarily Interfere with the development and operation of these commercial agencies. The subject Is one of great importance and calls for tbe earnest attention of the Congress. The message points out the value of the American forests and the necessity for their conservation, and urges the construction and maintenance of reservoirs and irrigating systems for tbe reclamation of the arid landa of the West. Of the water rights it says: in tne arid states the only right to water which should be recognized is that of use. In Irrigation this right should attach to the land reclaimed and be inseparable therefrom. Granting perpetual water rights to others than users, without compensation to the public, is open to all the objections which apply to giving away perpetual franchises to the public utilities of cities. A few of the Western states have already recognized this and have incorporated in their constitutions the doctrine of perpetual state ownership of water. "Our aim should be not simply to reclaim the largest area of land and provide homes for the largest number of people, but to create for this new industry the best possible social and Industrial conditions: and this re quires that we not only understand the ex isting situation, but avail ourselves of the best experience of the time In the solution of its problems. A careful study should be made, both by the nation and the states, of the Irlgation laws and conditions here and abroad. Ultimately it will probably be neces sary for the nation to co-operate with the several arid states In proportion as these states by their legislation and administration show themselves fit to receive it. Development of Hawaii. "In Hawaii our aim must be to develon the territory on the traditional American lines. We do not wish a region or large cities tilled by cheap labor; we wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the islands should be shaped with this end in view; the well-being of the average home maker must afford the true test of the healthy development of the inlands. The land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled on our homestead system. "It is a pleasure to say that It Is hardlv more necessary to report as to Porto Rico than as to any state or territory within our continental limits. The Island is thriving as never before, and it is being administered efficiently and honestly. Its people are now enjoying liberty and order under the pro tection ox tne imtea states, ana upon this fact we congratulate them and ourselves. Their material welfnre must be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare of any other portion of our country. We have given them the great gift of free access for their products to the markets of the United States. I ask the attention of the Congress to the need of legislation concerning the pub lic lands ot Porto Kico. Progress In Cuba. 'In Cuba such progress has been made to ward putting the independent government of the island upon a firm footing that before the present session of the Congress closes this will be an accomplished fact. Cuba will then start as her own mistress; and to the beauti ful Queen of the Antilles, as she unfolds this new page of her destiny, we extend our heartiest greetings aad good wishes. Else where 1 have discussed the question of reci procity. In the case of Cuba, however, there are weighty reasons of morality and of na tional Interest why tbe policy should be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom. indeed to the vital need, or providing for a substantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban Imports into the United States. Cuba has In her constitution affirmed what we de sired, that she should stand. In international matters, In closer and more friendly relations with us than with any other power; and we are bound by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures in the interest of her material well-being. The Philippine Problem. "In the Philippines our problem ia larger. They are very rich tropical islands, inhabi ted by many varying tribes, representing widely different stages of progress toward civilization. Our earnest effort Is to help these people upward along tne stony ana dif ficult path that leads to self-government. We hope to make our administration of the is lands honorable to our nation by making it of the highest benefit to the Filipinos them selves; and as an earnest of what we Intend to do, we point to what we have done. Al ready a greater measure oi material prosper ity and of governmental honesty and effici ency has been attained in the Philippines than ever before iu their history. i In dealing with tbe Philippine people we ; must show both patience and strength, for- j bear an ce and steadfast resolution. Our aim Is high. We do not desire to do for the Is- ! landers merely what has elsewhere been done j for tropic peoples by even the best foreign j governments. W hope to do for them what bas never before been done for any people ! of the tropics to make them fit for self- I government after the fashion of the really i free nutions. To leave tbe islands at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter ot i murderous anarchy. Such desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against hu manity. The character of Governor Taft and of his associates and subordinates Is a proof. if such be needed, of the sincerity or our er fort to eive the islanders a constantly in creasing measure of self-government, exactly as fast as they show themselves fit to exer cise it. Since the civil government was es tablished not an appointment bas been made in the islands with any reference to consider ations of political influence, or to aught else save the fitness ot tbe man and the needs of the service. "There are still troubles ahead in tne is lands. Tbe insurrection has become an affair of local banditti and marauders, who deserve i no higher regard than the briganas of por tions of the old world. Encouragement, di rect or indirect, to these insurrectos stands on the same footing as encouragement to hos tile Indiana in the days when we still had In dian wars. As we will do everything in our power for the Filipino who is peaceful, we will take the sternest measures with the Filipinos who follow the path of the lnsur recto and the ladrone. "The time has come when there should be i additional legislation for the Philippines. Nothing better can be done for tbe Islands j than to Introduce industrial enterprises, i Nothing would benefit them so much as throwing them open to Industrial develop- j ment. It Is therefore necessary that the Congress should pass laws by which the re sources of the islands can be developed; so i that franchises (for limited terms of years) can be granted tn companies doing business j in them, and every encouragement be given to the incoming of business men of every kind. "I call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from the Phil- j Ippines to points in Asia. We should not ; defer a day longer than necessary the con- struction of such a cable. It is demanded ' not merely for commercial but for political jnd military ccn si derations. I Esther -the Congress should Immediately j provide for the construction of a govern ment eaoie. or else an arrangement anouiu be made by wbich like advantages to those a ecru i r g from a govern ment ca ble may be secured to the government by contract with s private cable company. Recommends XU'reruan Canal. '. "No single great material work which re mains to bo ituderUtkeu on this continent Is of such consequence to the American people as the buildiiig of a canal across the Isthmus connecting North and South America. While its beneficial effects would perhaps be most marked upon the Pacific coast and tbe gulf and South Atlantic states, it would also greatly benefit other sections. It is em phatically a work which it is for the tnterest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon as possible; it ts one of those great works which only a great nation can under take with prospects of success, and which when done are .not only permanent assets i the nation's material interests, but stand ing monuments to Its constructive ability. "I am glad to be able to. announce to yon that our negotiations on this subject with Great Britain, conducted oo both sides in a spirit of friendliness and mutual . good will and respect, have resulted in my being able to lay before the Senate a treaty wbich if ratified will enable us to begin preparations for an Isthmfan canal at any time, and which guarantees to thia nation every right that it has ever asked tn connection with the canal. In this treaty, tbe old Clayton-Bul-wer treaty, so long recognized as Inadequate to supply the base for the construction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, is abrogated. It specifically provides that the United States alne shall do the work of building and assume the responsi bility of safeguarding the cnial and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms of equality without tbe guaranty or interference of any outside nation from any quarter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before tbe Senate, and If approved tbe Congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantages it secures us by providing for the building of tbe canal. "The true end of every great and free peo ple should be self-respecting peace; and this nation most earnestly desires sincere and cordial friendship with all others. Over the entire world, of recent years, wars between tbe great civilised powers have become less and less frequent. Wars with barbarous or smi-barbarous peoples come In an entirely different category, being merely a most re grettable but necessary international police duty wbich must be performed for tbe sake of the welfare of mankind. Peace can only be kept with certainty where both sides wish to keep It; but more and more the civilized peoples are realizing the wicked folly ot war and are attaining that condition of just and intelligent regard for the rights ot others which will In the end, as we hope and be lieve, make world-wide peace possible. Tbe peace conference at The Hague gave definite expression to this hope and belief and mark ed a stride toward their attainment. Tbe Monroe Doctrine. "This same peace conference acquiesced In our statement of the Monroe doctrine as compatible with the purposes and aims of tbe conference. "Tbe Monroe doctrine should be the car dinal feature of tbe foreign policy ot all the nations of the two Americas, as it is of the United States. The doctrine Is a declara tion that there must be no territorial ag grandizement by any non-American power at tbe expense of any American power on Amer ican soil. It is in no wise Intended as hostile to any nation In the old world. Still less is it Intended to give cover to any aggression by one new world power at the expense of any other. It is simply a step, and a long step, toward assuring tbe universal peace of tbe world by securing the possibility of per manent peace on this hemisphere. "This doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any American power, save that It in truth allows each of them to form such as It desires. In other words. It is really a guaranty of the commercial In dependence of tbe Americas. We do not ask under this doctrine ior any exclusive com mercial dealings with any other American state. We do not guarantee any state against punishment it It misconducts itself, pro vided that punishment does not take the form of the acquisition of territory by any non-American power. "Our attitude tn Cuba Is a sufficient guar anty of our own good faith. We have not tbe slightest desire to secure any territory at the expense of any of our neighbors. We wish to work with them band in hand, so that all of us may be uplifted together, and we rejoice over the good fortune of any of tneuj, we gladly hail their material prosper ity and political stability, and are concerned and alarmed if any ot tbem fall into Indus trial or political chaos. We do not wish to see any old world military power grow up on this continent, or to be compelled to become a military power ourselves. The peoples of the Americas can prosper best if left to work our their own salvation In their own way. Powerful Navy Urged. "The work of upbuilding the navy must be steadily continued. Whether we desire It or not, we must henceforth recognize that we have international duties no less than inter national rights. Even if our flag were haul ed down in the Philippines and Porto Rico, even if we decided not to build the Isthmian canal, we should need a thoroughly trained navy of adequate size, or else be prepared definitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our nation Is among those whose sons go down to the sea in ships. Unless our commerce Is always to be carried In for eign bottoms, we must have war craft to protect it. "So far from being In any way a provoca tion to war, an adequate and highly trained navy is the best guaranty against war, the cheapest and most effective peace insurance. Tbe cost of building and maintaining such a navy represents the very lightest premium for Insuring paece which this nation can possibly pay. "Probably no other great cation In the world is so anxious for peace aa we are. There la not a single civilized power which has anything whatever to fear from ag gressiveness on our part. All we want is peace; and toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respect for our rights In return, to Insure fair treatment to us commercially, and to guarantee the safety of the American people. "uur people intend to abide by tbe Mon roe doctrine and to insist upon it as the one sure n ;ans of securing the peace ot the Western hemisphere. The navy offers us the only means of making our insistence upon the Monroe doctrine anything but a sub ject of derision to whatever nation chooses to disregard It. We desire the peace which comes as of right to the just man armed; not the peace granted on terras of ignominy to the craven and tbe weakling. "It is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out. The ships must be built and the men trained long In advance. In tbe late war with Spain the ships that dealt the decisive blows at Manila and San tiago had been launched from two to four teen years, and they were able to do as they did because the men in the conning towers, the gun turrets and the engine-rooms had through long years of practice at sea learned now to do their auty. "It was forethought and preparation which secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1398. if we tall to show forethought and prepara tion cow, there may come a time when dis aster will befall us instead of triumph; and should this time come, the fault will rest primarily, cot upon those whom the acci dent of events puts In supreme command at the moment, but upon those who have failed to prepare tn advance. 'There should be no cessation In tbe work of completing our navy. It is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year ior several additional battleships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft In proportion: for the exact numbers and char acter I refer you to the report of the Secre tary of the Navy. But there is something we need even more than additional ships, and this is additional officers and men. To pro vide battleships and cruisers and then lay them un. with the expectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed In actual war, would be worse than folly; it would be a crime against the nation. 'To send any warship against a competent enemy unless those aboard it have been trained by years of actual sea service. In cluding Incessant gunnery practice, would be to invite not merely disaster, but the bitter est shame and humiliation. Four thousand additional seamen and one thousand addi tional marines should be provided; and an Increase in the officers should be provided by making a large addition to the classes at Annapolis. Our Present Naval Force. 'We cow have seventeen battleships ap propriated for. ot which nine are completed and have been commissioned for actual serv ice. The remaining eight will be ready In from two to four years, but it will take at least that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It Is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by" tbe time they are commissioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good weapons, aud the best weapons are useless save In the hands of men who know how to fight with them. Tbe men must be trained and drilled under a thorough and well-planned system of progressive instruction, while the recruit ing must oe cornea on witn sun greater vigor. "The naval militia forces are state organl atlons. and are trained for coast service, and in event of war they will constitute tbe inner line of defeuse. They should receive hearty encouragement from the general government. But in audition we should at once pro vide for a National Naval Reserve, organized and trained under the direction of the Navy Department, and subject to the call of tbe Chief Executive whenever war becomes Immi nent. It should be a real auxiliary to the naval seagoing peace establishment, and of fer material to be drawn on at once for manning our ships In time of war. It should be composed of graduates of the Naval Acad emy, graduates of the Naval Militia, officers and crews of coast-line steamers, longshore schooners, fishing vessels aud steam yachts, together with the coast population about such centers as life-saving stations and light houses. Need for Power's Navy. "The American people must either build snd maintain an adequate navy or else make up their minds definitely to accept a sec ondary position in international affairs, not merely in political, but iu citumercial, mat ters. It has been well said tha: there ts no surer way of courting national disaster than to be 'opulent, aggressive, ai.d unarmed. 'K Is not necessary to increase our army beyond Its present size at this time. But it is necessary to keep it at the highest point of efficiency. "Every effor sc-jM be made to bring the army to a constantly inTeastng state of ef ficiency. When on actual service no work save that directly in the line of such service should be required. The paper work -in tne army, as in the navy, should be greatly re- duced. What is needed is provea power or command and capacity to work well in tbe field. Constant care is necessary to prevent dry rot in the transportation and commis sary departments. ttw It will tA fwuutihlc tA hflTA flpld exprciiM I by at least a division of regulars, and If possible also s division of national guards men, once a year. "Only actual handling and providing for men in masses while they are marching, camping, embarking, and disembarking, wilt It be possible to train the higher officers to perform their duties well and smoothly. "A great debt Is owing from the public to the men ot the army and navy. They should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point of efficiency, so that they may be able to respond instantly to any demand made upon them to sustain the interests of tbe nation and tbe honor of the flag. Tbe Individual American enlisted man is prob ably on the whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular of any other army. Every consideration sbould be shown htm, and io return tbe highest standard of use fulness should be exacted from him. It Is well worth while for tbe Congress to con alder whether the car of enlisted men upon second and subsequent enlistments should. not be tne re sea to correspona witn me in creased value of the veteran soldier. Militia Law Obsolete. ' "Action should be taken In reference to the militia ant to tbe raising of volunteer roroes. Our militia lsw Is obsolete and worthless. The organization and armament of tbe Na tional Guard of the several states, wbich are treated as militia in t4ie appropriations by the Congress, sbould be made identical with those provided for the regular forces. Tbe obligations snd duties of the Guard In time of war sbould be carefully defined, and a system established by law under which tbe method of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed in advance. It Is utterly impossible in tbe excitement and haste of Impending war to do this satisfac torily If the arrangements have cot been made long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilising in tbe nrst volunteer or ganizations called out tbe training of those citizens who have already had experience un der arms, snd especially for the selection tn advance or the omcers or any rorce wntcn msy be raised; for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible alter the out break of war. "That the army Is cot at all s mere In strument or destruction bas been snown dur ing the last three years. In tbe Philippines. Cuba and Porto Rico it has proved itself a great constructive force, a most potent im plement for the upbuilding ot a peaceful civ ilization. Eulogy of Teterans. "No other citizens deserve so well of the republic as tbe veterans, the survivors ot those who saved the union. They did the one deed which it left undone would have meant that all else In our history went for nothing. But tor their stead rast prowess in the greatest crisis of our history, all our annals would be meaningless, and our great experiment in popular freedom and self-government a gloomy failure. Moreover, they not only left us a united nation, but they left us also as a heritage the memory of tbe mighty deeds by which tbe nation was kept united. We are now indeed one nation, one In fact as well as in name; we are united In our devotion to the flag which is tbe sym bol of alt national greatness snd unity; and the very completeness of our union enables us all, tn every part of the country to glory In tbe valor shown alike by tbe sons of the North snd the sons of the South In the times that tried men's souls. Merit System JEndorsed. "The merit system of making appointments is In Its essence as democratic and American as the common schools system Itself. It sim ply means that In clerical and other positions where the duties are entirely non-political. all applicants should have a fair field and no favor, each standing on his merits as he is SDte to snow t&em by practical test, writ ten competitive examinations offer tbe only available means in many cases for applying this system. In other esses, as where la borers are employed, a system of registra tion undoubtedly can be widely extended. There are, of course, places where tbe writ ten competitive examination cannot oe sp plied, and others where it offers by no means an ideal solution, but where under existing political conditions It is, though an imperfect means, yet tbe best present means of get ting satisfactory results. "It is important to have this system ob tain at home, but it Is even more important to cave it applied rigidly tn our Insular pos sessions. The administration of these Islands should be as wholly free from tbe suspicion of partisan politics as the administration of the army and navy. All that we ask from the public servant in the Philippines or Porto Kico is that ne renect honor on bis country by tbe way In which he makes that coun try's rule a benefit to the peoples who have come under It. This Is all that we sbould ask, and we cannot afford to be content with less. Treatment of Indiana The message points out the defects In our present consular service, and recommends tbe passage of bills now before Congress that will increase its efficiency. Of the Indian problem it says "In my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up our minds to recognize tbe Indian as an individual and not as a member of a tribe. The General Allotment Act Is s mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass. It acts direct ly upon the family of the individual. Under its provisions some sixty thousand Indians have already become citizens of the United States. We should cow break up tbe tribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the tribal lands; that la, they should be divided Into individual holdings. A stop should be put upon the indiscriminate per mission to Indians to lease their allotments. The effort should be steadily to make the Indian work like any other man on his own ground. The marriage laws of the Indians should be made tbe same as those of the whites. "In dealing with tbe aboriginal races few things are more important than to preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation resulting from the liquor traf fic. We are doing all we can to save our own Indian tribes from this evil. Wherever by International agreement this same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possess exclusive control, every effort should be made to bring It about. "I bespeak the most cordial support from the Congress and the people for the St, Louis Exposition to Commemorate the One Hun dredth Anniversary of the Louisiana Pur chase. This purchase was the greatest in stance of expansion in our history. It def initely decided that we were to become a great continental republic, by far the fore most power In the Western Hemisphere. The national government should be represented at the exposition by a full and complete set of exhibits. "The people ot Charleston, with great en ergy and civic spirit, are carrying on an ex position which will continue throughout most of the present session of tbe Congress. I heartily commend this exposition to the good will of the people. It deserves all the en couragement that can be given it. "For the sake of good administration, sound economy, and the advancement of science, tbe Census Office as now constituted should be made a permanent government bureau. This would insure better, cheaper and more sat isfactory work, tn tbe interest not only of our business but of statistic, economic and social science. "The remarkable growth of the postal ser vice is shown in the fact that its revenues have doubled and Its expenditures have near ly doubled within twelve years. Its progres sive development compels constantly increas ing outlay, but tn this period of business en ergy and prosperity Its receipts grow so much faster than its expenses that the annual de ficit bas been steadily reduced from $11,411. 779 in 1897 to $3,923,727 In 1101. Among recent postal advances tbe success of rural free delivery wherever established has been so marked, and actual experience has made its benefits so plain, that the demand for Its ex tension ts general and urgent. Growth of Postal 8ervlee "It Is just that the great agricultural popu lation should share in the Improvement of the service. The number of rural routes cow in operation is 6,009. practically all established within three years, and there are ,QU0 appli cations awaiting action. It is expected that tbe number in operation at tbe close of tbe current fiscal year will reach 8,600. The mail will then be daily carried to tbe doors of 5,700.000 of our people who bave heretofore been dependent upon a is tan t omces, and one- third of all that portion of the country which is aaaptea to it win be covered by this kina of service. Second-Class Mall Matter. The full measure of postal progress which might be realised bas long been hampered snd obstructed by tbe heavy burden imposed on the government through the intrenched and well-understood abuses which have grown up in connection with second class mail matter. The extent of this burden ap pears when tt is stated that while the second-class matter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight ot all the mail. It paid for the last nscai year only S4.ZH4,445 of tbe aggre gate postal revenue of $111,631,193. If tbe pound rate of postage, which produces tbe large loss thus entailed, and which was fixed by the Congress with the purpose of encour aging the dissemination of public Informa tion, were limited to tbe legitimate news papers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law, no Just exception could be taken. That expense would be the recognized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy de liberately adopted for s Justifiable end. But much of tbe matter which enjoys tbe privi leged rate ts wholly outside ot tbe Intent of the law, and has secured admission only through sn evasion of its requirements or through lax construction. Tbe proportion of sucb wrongly included matter Is estimated by postal experts to be one-half of the whole volume of second-class mail. If It be only one-third or one-quarter, the magnitude ot the burden Is apparent. Tbe Postoffice De partment bas now undertaken to remove tbe abuses so far as is possible by a stricter ap plication of the law; and it sbould be sus tained in its enort. "We view with lively Interest and keen hopes of beneficial results the procedlogs ot the Pan-American Congress, convoked at the invitation or Mexico, ana now sitting at tbe Mexican capital. The delegates of the United States are under the most liberal instructions to co operate with their colleagues in sll matters promising advantage to the greet family of American commonwealths, as well in their relations among themselves as In their domestic sdvancement and in their Intercourse witb tbe world at large. The occurrences arising from tbe "Boxer" outbreak in Chins are reviewed in detail, and the steps taken to secure to the United States Its share of tbe trade of the Orient are ex plained. The message concludes: "The death of Queen Victoria caused the people of tbe United States deep and heart felt sorrow, to wbtrh the government gave full expression. When President McKinley died, our nation In turn received from every quarter of the British empire expressions of grief and sympathy no less sincere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany also aroused the genuine sympathy of the American people; and this sympathy was cordially reciprocated by Germany when the President was assassinated. Indeed, from every quarter of the civilized world we re ceived, st the time of tbe President's death, assurances of such grief snd regard as ti touch tbe hearts of our people In the mtdf of our affliction we reverently thank tbe A' mighty that we are at peace with the natlo of mankind; and we firmly -Intend that r policy shall be such as to continue snbrol these International relations of mutual -spect and good wtin
