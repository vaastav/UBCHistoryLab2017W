The Schoolhouse Findings. T?#> report ol tti<? architects and nunciors chosen by the Commissioners to inquire inl" the physical condition of the local public school system is impressive in its thoroughness and its fairness. It is a full, plain statement of facts as they exist, unsensational and clearly free from prejudice or a desire on the part of the investigators either to whitewash anybody or to put anybody "in a hole." It is the more effective in its temperate tone than if it had laid stress upon the defects discovered and sought to alarm the public. It was the purpose of the Commissioners In selecting these citizens to examine the school buildings to ascertain conditions. and in discharging that duty the investigators were wise in not undertaking to lay blame upon individuals or groups for such defects as they found. The report fully meets the official requirements as a presentation of facts, and it points the way clearly to the removal of all the factors which niay have caused anxiety on the part of the people. It is a great relief to the public to find that there is nothing seriously wrong with the school equipment, to the point of menacing the community with disaster, although many defects were found, both in the planning and the construction of the buildings and in their management. It is particularly satisfying to the community that after the immediately essentia] corrections have been made?supplementing those that have been undertaken in the course of the investigationthere will be no cause whatever of panic among the teachers and the pupils, and no ground for apprehension on the part of parents. All the authorities now clearly understand what is to be done to bring the schools up to the highest possible mark permitted by the appropriations. Some of the worst defects have already been cured. Others will doubtless be corrected without delay. Meanwhile this report should enable the Commissioners to go ahead and get from Congress the funds necessary for the repair work indicated by the investigators and for the completion and construction of the new buildings required to relieve congestion and to carry out the recommendations as to the safety of the children. The commission was charged with the igsk of eliciting the exact facts and indicating the real remedies for such defects as it might find. It has discharged this duty conscientiously sind capably, without furnishing any one controversialist with a monopoly of ammunition for attacks upon others. Vet the report is not a "whitewash." It does not condone defaults or minimize defects in order that any individual's sensibilities may be spared from injury. The members of the wjiiiuiBBtuii nave piainty acted solely in the public interest, and now it is tho duty f everybody, on the basis of this excellent presentation, to turn in and work shoulder to shoulder to the end that the children may be given the fullest possible protection from danger. There Should be no wore wasting of time in futile recriminatory discussion of responsibility for things that have been done or left undone in the past, but a whole-hearted co-operation on all sides to make the public schools of Washington just as sanitary ar.d just as safe nfi Congress in its appropriations will permit. Another "Marathon*' Victor. T.:?sc "Marathon" races are yielding some very confusing results. First Hayes beats Dorando in England on a:i outdoor course, the Italian losing because he lacks staving power and falling almost at the tape. Next Dorando beats Hayes In New Vork ?n an indoor race, both men finishing in good condition and establishing a new retoid for the distance. Finally, Longboat who gave up in the twentieth mile in the English race, runs Dorando ?T his feet in .Madison Square Garden. winning easily w.th the Italian in total collapse and never finishing. But ti e Indian's race was *_'ns4 mmutes slower man t.int of Dorando when he beat Hayes. Up to the twentieth mile the runners, who had kept within less than three yards of re another from the crack of the pistol, were ahead of the Dorando-Hayes New Vork time. The pace, however, told on both men. more severely on Dorando. as the event proved. Possibly if the early pace had been more moderate Dorando. with Ins ability to sprint and nia more nervous action, might have held the Indian down to a position from which us could have rushed to victory on the last lap. Dorando now has collapsed twice on the course, and must he rated as an uncertain quantity in long-distance runs. , , . ^ <r ?v,/n Iiou fic't orv 'UhH Duril Ul UK" till*'*- III* II liao ?

There should now be a rare between Longboat and Ha.vea indoors, and then *'1 three men should contest for the world championship, on an Outdoor course, Marathon distance. A strong argument In favor of granting those London ladie.- the right to vote is that it might prevent them front being suffragettes. Fortunately for tiic courts, only a small percentage of threatened libel suits materialize. A Czar and His Subjects. The N>w York Kvnlng Post observes: "The ferocious republican insurgents in Congress are really as considerate as any (Jtlbertiau pirate who never let a Sunday pass without writing to his mother, or as that lion rough who in wildest rage did roar, but was only Snug the Joiner. Having determined upon the overthrow of the House rules which make Mr. Cannon a czar and force the congressman who would get a hearing to consult the Speaker in his private room, our implacable Insurgents are going to see the Speaker about It In his private room. "Please, sir," congressmen have been in the habit of saying up till now, "may I get the floor some aay next week to -peak on the rivers and harbors bill?" "No." says Mr. Cannon. "Well, then, please sir. may 1 get the floor to say that you ere a czar, a despot, a usurper, a brutal presiding officer, an Ignorant parliamentarian'." Thla little flight of fancy, the Evening Post may he interested to hear, is justified by a fact. In the Flfty-flrzt House, when Mr. Reid first applied the new rules, there served a man from North Carolina of the name of MeC'tgmmy. He oas a thin and an explosive person, a farmer, and much given to the rural style of political discussion. But he was sound at the core, and had MAK. Being a democrat, be united with his party associates in de nounelng the new order of procedure, al though he had but the dimmest idea o the matter. But he admired Mr. Rei< very much, and between the two theri was a strong bond of good feelhV Mr MoCIammy was one of the democrats o that day who while holding Mr. Reid U] in public to the severest censure, in the! hearts were sighing for Just such a mat for leader on their ow n side. One day the North Carolina membe went to the Speaker and asked to b< recognized the next day for a speech. "On what subject?" asked the Speaker "You." replied Mr. McClammy. "The rules, you mean?" "Yes. It comes to the same thing You see. there's a fellow running agalns mc for the nomination, and I'm about tj start for home to meet him on the stump If I could send a red-hot speech ahoad o me in the Record it would help." "You'll give it to me in good st>1e, wil you 7" "T il give you the best I've got in thi shop." "Well, with that understanding yoi shall have a chance tomorrow. Mr. McClammy exhausted the curren vocabulary of criticism, called the Speake' a tjrant. a czar, and predicted that unlesi a halt was called America would soon b< no better than Russia. Mr. Reed presided, and neither winke< nor blinked. All efforts to call the Tar heel statesman to order were ruled out and the terrible arraignment closed witl great applause on the democratic side. In a few days Mr. McClammy followet his- speech home, but found that his ef fort had been in vain. His people had no been enthused by it, and the other fellov got the nomination. i'pon his return to Washington. Mr McClammy, making a virtue of necessity called on the Speaker and confessed judg inent. The speech had failed. But hi would not forget the courtesy of the rec ognition. "I'm sorry. Mac." drawled the Speaker shaking his friend's hand. "I wanted yoi to win. But don't be cast down. Yoi did as well with the subject as> anybod; who has attempted it." Be not deceived by this clatter abou czars and ozarlsm. It is immensely am amusingly Pickwickian from the Inside. The Canal Message. The President's invective disfigured? to use a mild word?his Panama messago. That sort of thing is easily overdone." It goes with anger, real or simulated, and anger should never mark a state paper. Even a criminal lawyer, working up a jury with furj and superlatives, can injure his case b> excesses of that kind. Facts speak louder than words. They carry a sufficient denunciation of false statements where false statements have been made. They really secure the verdict, either from a jury of twelve men, or from the whole people. For the rest, the message is a strong document. It sets forth from sources entitled to the highest credit what all should be gratified to hear, and what few will be surprised to hear. Not many persons in all probability hav? ever believed that there was a riot ol American corruption in the acquisition of the canal property by this government. Nothing of a confirmatory character has ever been offered to support the assertion. It seems to have rested mainly on the fact that the property belonged to a bankrupt and discredited concern. And then as scandal had at tached to the old French enterprise, tin overly suspicious lent an ear to the chargi that scandal as a hoodoo was still fo! lowing. Connecting the names of two such re sponsible and reputable men as Dougla: Robinson and Charles P. Taft with th< matter made it still more unpersuasive A hot presidential campaign was in prog less, and the object was to Injure th< republican ticket. But the object failet utterly. In New York and Indiana where the * revised story received iti j largest circulation, the republican ticke | was impressively indorsed. The voteri | were not to he caught with such rani : bail. j The question arises, is it necessary, aftei i this message, for Congress to invest! i gate the charges? Have they not beet sufficiently disposed of? The answer is No. A vote by Congress would carry' ai added weight to the business. Almos i as much was known before the recen ! revival of the charges as is known now I But that did not prevent the lugging o ' the allegations into the presidential cam paign: and the Intention was to hav< ! the result turn on a matter which pre tonrlorl t a tror a o h i <s!i I v itnnpAnPr mnnai k\.'n ?

An investigation by Congress, and tliei a vote, would silence all accusers forever There would be no danger then of t : revival four years hence, or at any time of an attack either on the country 01 ! on individuals in connection with th? i canal and its purchase.

"Ik Marvel." Fifty-eight years ago a young Nev j England writer produced a little hook o "reveries." They were totally diflferen from anything that had ever been don< before, being a series of intimate reflec tions In the course of which a remlniscen bachelor reviews his sentimental career bringing to mind successively the womei he has loved, and the pictures he ha: painted in his mind of home happiness The book reached the heart of the Amerl can people Immediately. It became t great favorite because it was somethini every one could understand, somethini elemental and wholesome. It has beet printed innumerable times. passim through scores of editions, and appearin) In a great variety of "gift-book" forms It has been, in fat". for more than half i century, perhaps the most popular produc of an American pen. | Donald Grant Mitchell, who bestow** j this boon of a good book upon the Eng llsh-speaking people, has just died at tin age of eighty-four. He was more form ; rate than many wrkers, for he spent vlr tuailv his entire; working life in an atmos ! phere of appreciation and affection. H< I pasted away with his name a househol* i word, with his great bool; a treasure* | possession in 'ens of thousands of homes ! It was doubtless an inspiration .o knot that that single writing had been s* widely recognized as something good. an< to feel that It had helped others to bra ! the burdens of life. i This bcok will alwa>s stand as a lit I orary landmark.
