It Is Disappointing to a Great many of tbe Members of Coneress Wbat Senator Piatt Says of It Ex-Speaker Reed Is Outspoken In Regard to tbe Tarts' Tbe New York Sun Sits on It Wltb Great Porce Ensllab Hem papers Commend It as an Able and Porcible Document. Washington, Dec. 4 The general ten' timent among members of congress re specting the president's message la doubt less one of disappointment, not because of what is said so mnoh as because of omis sion to treat in detail many matters in which the members of the houses are in ierested. This particularly applies to Ha wailan affairs. The treatment acoorded the finanoial queBtlon was also disappoint ingly general. Nevertheless the message was generally regarded by democrats as being an able document and one caloalated to secure the united support of the party for tho president; while the republicans took It sue in soma of the more important statements and particularly denonnoed his utterances on the tariff. Mr.Wileon,dem. of West Virginia, ohalrman of the ways and means committee, said: I am especially pleased at wbat be says on tbe tariff queBtlon.' Ex-Speaker Keed said: "mat part of the message which relates to the tariff is most surprising. It asseverates that the house committee in charge of that enbject has for mulated plans and devised methods of tax ation which, as a member of the commit tee, I have never heard even proposed. It is a rather, nnnenal sensation to learn of the deeds of the oommittee not in the commit tee but from the president." "It is bad enough to have a tariff bill made up by a little coterie, bnt to have it oommunioated to the president before it reaches even the committee still less the house shows a determination to be moved by no facts and mollified by no argu ments." Senator Palmer, dem., Illinois, chairman of the committee on pensions, said: "I am inclined to think that the president's idea concerning frandnlent pensions is wide of tbe mark. I believe my acquaint ance with old soldiers and the pension list of the country is as extensive as that of any one man, and I am prepared to say that the number of the fraudulent pensions is ex ceedingly small and the clamor that has been raised has very little foundation. 1 do not believe that 2 per oent. of the pen sions issued are fraudulent." Senator Aid rich, rep . Bhode Island, said: "The message is disappointing to those who hold different views from those of the administration on the tariff, and muBt be more so to those who have been In sympathy with the president's past at titude on the subject." Senator tlale or Maine, ealdt VitepnMl- cans will certainly take issue with the president on the tariff, bnt those, at least, from the east will no doubt endorse his suggestions regarding onr finances." "Tbe only slgninoant thing about tbe whole business," said Senator Chandler, "is that the president endorses the Wilson raid on protected industries in all its de tails. We do not know what he has done in Hawaii. I look npon the attitude of the administration in connection with Hawaii as a disgraoeful chapter in the story of onr relations with other govern ments." Senator Piatt, rep., of Connecticut, took marked exception to that part of tbe mes sage which asserted that Mr. Blonnt'a re port had demonstrated "beyond all ques tion" that tne regular government 01 Hawaii had been subverted by tbe Interfer ence of United States forces. As to the tariff part Mr. Piatt remarked that the anthor wno wrote a dook on -ropuiar ueinsions ought to add another chapter on the delu sions of tbe democratic party on the sub ject of the tariff. "They seem to think," he said, "that it is possible to gWe away all our markets and still retain them to eat our cake and have It. too. I muat give them credit for having the sincerity to express their on- victions." Boston, Deo. 4. The Herald, ind., says of the president's message: "Mr. Cleve land's message is of reasonable length, and it is conoltely worded, it is clear and frank in statement, and when we say this we say wbat is equivalent to declaring it to be cbaraoteristio of its author. The message is well written, which is likely to ensure its reading. It will in crease the strong confidence in its author." The Evening Record, rep., says: "As the case now stands hla annonnoed program towards the Sandwich Islands leaves to congress but one dnty, but once before in voked, and tnat in tne case or Andrew Johnson. We sincerely hope that an ex planation will be forthcoming, and that at once. Congress should watt a reasonable time for it to come. Then it nrust act. The president is expressly forbidden by the constitution from declaring or making war." The Post, 'dem., says: "Mr. Cleveland has produced a message whioh, while as broadly comprehensive as any stickler for tradition may demand, is yet interesting for the reason that some positive and plain facta are advanced on each or tne many topics considered. Business has been so far advanced by tne repeal ot tne suver act at the extra session and by the preparation of the new tariff bill during the reoese that there Is little novelty and no surprise left for prodnetion in the president's massages. Its resolutions have mostly been foreseen and its statements are generally only a re assurance of what Is already nnderstood if not specifically declared." Tbe Ulobe, dem., says there is no mis taking the president's staunchness to his convictions. He stands firmly, as always, for tbe right as he sees It. There is no aid or comfort in tbe message for faintheart edness or timidity in tariff legislation. Party considerations and the welfare of the mnltitudinons business interests demand that the line Indicated by Mr. Cleveland's message shall be carried ont firmly and faithfully. The tilobe says that ur. uieveland s ref erence to tbe Hawaiian situation is brief, and that comment on this matter and the president's action thereon may be well de ferred nntil the promised special message to congress is forthcoming. New York, Deo. 5. The Sun says of the message: Cleveland devotes more space to what he regards as an excessive pur ebase of seeds by tbe department of agri culture than to the momsntus enterprise of throne-building whioh he has undertaken in Hawaii. He devotes almost as many words to the condition of the North Amer ican tribes as to the tariff, whioh occupied all of his thoughts in 1887, and which has become in 1893 an affair not merely of promises, bnt of performance. For these reasons the message may fairly be oritloised as unsatisfactory in its range, if not actu ally evasive In its intention. w The personal note sounds as usual throughout the message. The Tribune says: "The first snow storm and the message appropriately came to gether to warn people that a hard winter was coming. In its treatment of nearly alt uomestio questions tne message is creel itable in character, not more verbose than is usual for Mr. Cleveland, and in the main reasonable .in its suggestians. Bnt the country will judge this message and the president mainly by the position he has taken regarding the question which most vitally affects the industries and earnings ot American wormngmen." London, Deo. 5. The Post says of Pres ident Cleveland's message: "There ia no indication la it of party exaltation. Mr, Cleveland leaves his countrymen to draw the inferences from tbe facts detailed, al though nearly every paragraph would be lnetrnotlve reading if printed Id parallel eolnmna with some of Ur. Harrison's high sounding orations." Commenting on the president's message the Dailey Graphic oomllmenUltr. Cleve land upon his con tinned firmness and con sistency. The Times says: The message exhibits olear and well reasoned views of policy as well as mnch foroe of oharaoter. The por tions bearing upon foreign affairs are oon oeived in a highly creditable spirit and with an adequate sense of national dignity. The Times oommends with special warmth the president's policy towards Hawaii. The Telegraph says of Ur. Cleveland's utterances concerning Hawaii: Snob a frank and honest admission of a mistake and avowal of the intention to reverse it reflects the highest possible credit upon the president, and, Indirectly, upon the nation. The Chroniole says: The president will have the best wishes of every sound eoon - Jn.1; are on his side. The Financial News: It is Impossible not to be strnok with the earnestness of Mr. Cleveland's convictions and his broad, sound etatssmanshiD. The Standard: From onr point of view, despite Mr. Cleveland's friendly attitude toward this country, the new tariff might almost be pnt down as the work of an enemy.
