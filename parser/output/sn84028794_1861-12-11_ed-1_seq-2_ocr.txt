We give this document in full on the first page of this week's pnper. ."It may bo said truly that this is a message which does not contain much to either condemn or approve. The greatest approval that can be made for ifis.its length, being short. Fortius Mr'. Lincoln deserves great credit, be cause by issuing a short message it will be more universally read. On points that the people were expecting him to speak fully, he is Lixcdlnisii all over, that is, it is impossible to toll what his opinions arc. ( There is a great deal of the Illinois Yantee running through the whole document. If any one is able to tell what his opinions are in re lation to our foreign affairs or emanci pation, they will be much wiser than Mr. Lincoln supposes them to be. "AYe would advise our readers to give this document, coming from tho gen tleman elected by the Republican par ty President of the United States, a careful reading. Also read the opin ion of the Cincinnati Commercial, a pa per that done more than any other one in the "West to secure his election, con cerning liis message.

Wo puhlish the full telegraphic reports sent out by the Associate Press, without al teration or abridgement. It will be seen by reading them, that that great fellow, 'Sumbo," occupies a prominent place in the cranhmis of our distinguish ed men who assemble to, make laws for the nation at the rate of $3,000 a year. Most of the Republican members it is said, keep a negro' constantly with and before them, to smell and look at, so as to gather ideas about tho "great ques tion of slavery." Bully for "Sambo," and bullicr still for humbug and $3, 000 a year. k ; g Cambridge, over here in Guern sey county, for the size of the place, is the .greatest town to turn out Quarter masters for the Army that we have erer Heard of. They have already three, anil how many more they have in pros pect, is more than we can tell. The three that are aire vdy appointed, arc as follows: 30th Regiment, Mr. Lof land, said to be an excellent appoint ment; Mr. Douglas, editor of the Times, and totally unfit for the place, as time will prove, Quartermaster of the 78th; andthe last appointment is a Mr. Wm. , M. " Farrar, a one horse 'Jawyer and country singing master, Quartermaster of the 65th Ohio Regiment, Sherman's brigade. It is not necessary to note the fact we suppose, that all the good, bad and , ' indifferent Quartermasters from that town, are all the rankest kind of Republicans. That would not be necessary to tell our readers, when theyknow that his Excellency, Wm. Dennison, Jr., make the appointments. ' - . Gelling 1'ireU of ihe Hume.

We hsve elsewhere spoken of the Bntirfi trap into which the American people have so unwisely fallen. And we now call the attention of Western people specially to another scheme, planned by their own countrymen, of which they have been made the unsus pecting victims, and which the Yank ees are making pay much better than any former speculation. The Cincinnati Enijuivcr lias a' Re publican correspondent, whom that pa per admits" into iN columns for die laud able purpo.se of letting its readcrsknow what genuuinc Republicanism consists of much, we suppose, as the Greeks used to make their slaves drunk, and exhibit them to their children as a warning against intemperance. In one of his late letters, this- correspondent ceases his ordinarily incendiary talk, and gives facts and figures which must prove very startling to all classes of Western people. These figures show that the war is immensely profitable to New England, while its burdens fall with crushiii" force upon the people of tho West. Months ago, it was shown that Western lands would pay altogether out of proportion to their value of the direct taxes levied for the prosecution of the war; but this is a trifling matter when compared with the ruinous losses inflicted on Western trade for tho ben-! efit of that of New England. The Yankees flourish. Every ship is busy, hired by the Government. Every railroad is making immense profits. Stocks arc going up at a marvelous rates. Manufactures, under the Morrill tariff, and by reason of war demands, aro making those engaged in them im mensely rich. Even a certain sort of foreign trade is made increditably lu crative to this favorcdsection. Ono dealer in groceries and calico made throe hundred thousand dollars in a single transaction in Liverpool. But the West is prostrate. Her trade is destroyed. The Mississippi is closed. Produco is worthless. Corn will probably be burned as fuel. Pork three dollars per hundred. &c, &c., &c. Who doc3 not see, in all this, tho resons of anti-slavery agitation in New England their opposition to Compro mise thoir advocacy of war, and op position to peace? And now, good friends of all this mighty Wst! would you not have been better off if yon had paid less attention to tho advice of Greeley, Mrs. Stowey Sumner, .Hale Wilson, and other Yankee Abolitionists who arc now reap ing golden harvests, while your profits have disappeared? And if you had , given greater heed to the admonitions of men whom you cursed as minions of the Slave-Power, tools of the Slave Oligarchy, UnionSavers, and Com promisers? As Mr. Lincoln once said, we assert nothing. Wo are only ask ing questions. Logan Gazette. The Union Swindle. We were told in the summer, that the 'Union Movement' was not a party movement. That party had nothing to do with it. That it was patriotic and sinless, conceived in piety, and brought forth in holiness, and too exalt ed in purpose to inquire whether a can didate for office was Democrat or Re publican, provided only that ho was in favor of maintaing the Union by the suppression of rebellion. No man can dispute that the character which we assign to the Union movement, is that which was given to it by its friends. - In this manner many Democrats, not intending to make any permanent surrender of their party principles, laid them aside for the time being, and voted with the spurious Unionists; and numerous Democrats, with the. same views precisely, permitted themselves to be run as candidates, and accepted seats in tho Legislature. . The schemo provided to be a decided hit, which with tho auxiliary aid of tho mob and the Federal power, prevented the ex posure of Republican iniquity, and ef fected the defeat of tho Democracy. And now, after the election is all over, imagine tho surprise of cvery bodyj arid especially of the Democrats elected to the Legislature, as well as of the Democrats who voted for them, when it in aunouced that the illiterate and vulgar . olt' ruffian, .Bori Wade,' most be elected, to the Senate!

Logan Ga- BQ This war is being carried on for the puqiose of restoring the Union, j we are told by those in authority, and we have no reason to doubt it. We all confidently expect that ere long our Government will have, as in days of yore, full possession of all the channels on tnc southern coast, ana tne same Government that governs us will gov ern all sections of the Union. We all hope and pray for this, and wish our prayers to be Fpcedily answered. Such being the case, can any one tell us tho uwo-w-iieeessity of purchasing a lot of old Yankee whaling vessels from tho "beloved inhabitants of New Eng land," yt au enormous price, and filling them with stone, and then taking them to Southern channels and sinking them, to prevent vessels from passing thro' these channels. In tiro course of time our Government will have the control and use of these channels. But what use will these channels be to this nation if they arc filled up with a lot of sunken ships? When the Government has full sway over the whole Union, (which we hope m iy be soon,) then these dearly bought Yankee old whale ships, which Mr. Secretary Welles purchased from his PAKTicrLAtt friends in Yankeedom, will have to be removed at a much greater expense than it costs to place them there, which God knows was enough for treble their number. We would' in all honesty and candor say, that the sinking of these old whalers is a very useless expensive job, that does no good whatever, unless, it is to the Yankees who have received a heavy pile of money fov them. It would be far more economical for the Government if they would pay their Yankee pnrtizan pets in some oth cr manner, than by purchasing their old worn out whalers for the purpose they have'Jately been purchasing them for.

Jhrce times has the gallant state ol Kentucky declared by overwhehnning ma joritics that she wculd not leave the u nited btates to run alter strange gods, or lor tho so called Southern Confederacy and to re lieve them from despotism and to protect thoir rights. Ah, we were deceived, we were told by tho executive of this so-called South ern Confederacy, that it v,as intended to ro spect the condition of Kentucky, Which it was protended would not bo dono by tho go vernment of the United States. The Union men of Kentucky never did deny the right of the United States Govern- j ment to occupy tts sou lor the exercise of the purposes imposed by the Constitution. Kentucky had acknowledged her obligations, and expressed her determination to fulfil them. I he proclamation of Ihe uovt-rnor of Kentucky deceived tho people, but the Leg islature denounced it. Two messengers of peace were sent to the Executive of the United States, and one to the President of tho Southern Government j to know what was intended to be done with Kentucky. The former said it was inten ded to maintain the laws and tho Constilu tion of the United Stales, and that this' was believed to be the will ol the people of Ken tucky. The latter declared that he intended to respect the neutrality of Kentucky, as un derstood by the secession party in that State ; but tho southern press did not tell them that he had matured a plan to assail them at three dillercnt points. .Nor . did be tell them there was on tho statute book of the Southoru government a lnw .providing roeney and means not to BiiMain Kentucky against oppression, but to carry her into tho South ern Von'cderncy against the majority ol two thirds ol the cniire Slato. , The provisional governor of Kentucky was sent to see the government at lliqhmond. Meanwhile Mr. Burnett was at the head of the new order of affairs in tho discharge of his duty, and an armed force had been gath ered, compof ed of young, desperate and reck less men, commanded by Uuckrer. In conclusion, Mr. Vt tcklilte Mid, with the blessing of God, I predict that by the 25th of December no hostile foot willde lounu on the soil of Kentucky.
