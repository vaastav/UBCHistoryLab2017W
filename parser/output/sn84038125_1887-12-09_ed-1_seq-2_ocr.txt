Two of our esteemed cotemporaries, the Avant Courier, aged 17, and the Missoula Times, aged 7, have celebrated their barth days recently. We wash each many happy returns. MINxZAPOLJs is attaining front rank as a great city. They had a Socialist funeral there the other day with a red flag at the boad of the procession, Socialistic speeches in German at the grave, etc. TnH President, on Tuesday, fulfilled ex pectations by advancing Lamar, Vilas and Dickinson, as shown in the telegrams, and has even made several . other important appointments from the Northern States. But what about Sparks's successor? Is there none worthy to fill the place of that great and good man ? Tas Republican National Committe met in Washington, D. C., yesterday, to deter -.a. ti.h timn and niaps of holdinv the next Republican National Convention. A dozen a cities were aspirants for it. James H. Mills, the member for Montana, authorized his vote for Minneapolis, although the probabil ities were a more eastern city would be se lected. THE Independent of the 6th publishes the program of exercises for the Territorial Teachers' Institute, to be held in Helens, commencing Dec. 27th and continuing three days.

Layton, Butte, and C. L. Howard, Helena. The railroads have all given reduced rates, and there is promise of a large and benefi. cial meeting. IT was telegraphed last week that the i President's message would be 20,000 words in length. As this would occupy ten columns of the NEW 

NORTH-WEST we ar ranged for enough of it for our local edition in supplement form. It turned out to be I only 6,000 words in length, so we could have It accommodated it with space, but we found c it out too late and hence our local patrons I get the benefit of that much extra reading t this week. We hope the President did not e "let any of it get away," so there will be v another Instalment to come, and commend v the brevity of the document. THE friends of the dead Anarchists in t Chicago have procured ground in Greenwood v Cemetery, some 18 miles from Chicago, and h propose on Dec. 18th to take the bodies h from the vault in WaldheIm cemetery and ti convey them to Greenwood, going through sl Chicago with the parade. There will be b several thousand Anarchists from other d points In Chicago that day to swell the ti resident throngs in the city. It is believed tl the Mayor will, as he should, prohibit the y parade through the city, and it is not un- a likely anyhow that there will be occasion o1 for suppression by the police. Is d A

Now like It has been sanued fore. It 'is siaply an argumena em $q questions of public policy-the surplus and tLe reduction of taxesimd Ifs. No reference is made to any dop" trD meat policy or transactions, or even t1sti _ foreign or domestic relations of the VT2st9 States-it has not even the customary ins he cation of Divine favor or assurance etc la operation in legislation for the welfare th the country. It is simply the Presideni PY ideas of how to get rid of the surplus, which he utterly Ignores and evidently ta opposed to the sage recommendations al Samuel J. Tilden on that subject, and be apparently getting even on that gentlema es for having cut in ahead of him and delivers a message just ahead of Cleveland's to Co gress two years ago, and his further ide x. on the tariff question and the method i rd hlbch the Democratic party should hand ad it to catch votes next fall. nt The brevity of the message is its par ,s. mount virtue. We are rather a convert I re the elimination of detailed Departments at affairs, which are fully set forth in the ri ports of heads of departments, from ti message of the President and its confinemer et to the state of the Union generally at r- executive recommendations more concise] it a .. .. 1. ,K "e*ae. The ord 9n nary message in all its statistical prolixil It is only read by the few, whereas the brig is message will command the attention of al In length Cleveland seems to have struc e, the happy medium between a Victoria paragraph and a Johnsonian prolixity, bt re the merit of it is detracted from by the er al clusion of all other topics that two might I treated with detailed diffuseness and use .e as a campaign primer. * The accumulations in the treasury an ;e the difficulty of applying them to the ri e. demption of bonds are clearly stated, an e. the recommendation limiting the Secretary discretion in applying the surplus to the purpose is commendable, but we believ Tilden's views that a large amount of mone . should be as soon as practicable expended I fortifying our sea coasts is wiser than Cleve land's idea of abutting off the supply by rad e ically reducing the tariff revenues. How is ever, Tilden's views were expressed 1mme n diately after a presidential election, an Cleveland's are expressed immediately pre a ceding one, which makes a material differ e ence. While he argues adroitly, and is aste a the "agricultural vote" and the "labor vote' a on the tariff question, he does not commi s himself on the revision of internal revene e taxes on liquors, tobaccos, etc., as there I t evidently a diversity of opinion on tha a within his party which he does not care tu meet by specific recommendations, while thi tariff he can discuss largely in generalities His only specific recommendation as relater i to that has already brought down on him thi I vehement protest of the wool growers, and I he will find that, carefully as he has worded his opinion on the tariff he has not satisfied I the free trade wing of the party, while hit i speech, as echoed back in loud laudations 3 by the English press will be taken as a r declaration of war by manufacturers. Even s the South, with its wonderful progression in I this direction will not remain Solid many i years, if it is now, for a party committed to a policy that receives the free trade approval of England. Specious as is his reasoning, it is beyond any question that a material re duction of tariff will cut down manufactur ing wages in this country to relatively those of Europe, and the Republican party will take up the gauntlet he has thrown down and make the fight on a "tariff for protec tion," if his party will endorse the Cleveland views. James G. Blaine has been inter viewed and declared for a protective tariff in words that will appeal to the sense of the American people stronger than those of the President. If the Democrats in Congress are willing to go before the country on the Cleveland plan the Republicans will cbeer fully meet them on that line in the campaign of'88 snd if they should be beaten in that they will have laid the foundation for an overwhelming majority four years later, One administrations as Cleveland proposes will bring a revonition of public sentiment against it that sill stamp it out of existence. The Free Traders have nagged Cleveland up to a point that, while not satisfactory to w. tem, will be suflicient for the defeat o ad their party if it shall allow him to sot the er, battle. at 

ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS. ýd' ke The Senate assembled at noon, Monday ist with Senator Ingalls presiding, and, not cb withstanding It had been rumabred there of would be several contests, all new Senatori ye were sworn in except Charles J. Faulkner aft of West Virginia, whose admission was hek in- for consideration, pending which he is al ril lowed the privilege of the floor. Faulknei ha was, it is alleged, at the time of his election, to May 5, 1887, Judge of the Thirteenth Judi. se clal District of West Virginia, and therefore v- Ineligible. The technical objection that bil , election had not been certified by the Gov ernor over the seat of the State was also or offered. The case will come before the he committee on privileges and elections. The e" Senate then appointed the customary com ag mattees to announce to the House and Preel. ad dent its readiness for business. m The House was called to order at noon, ie 313 members being present. The vote for n Speaker resulted-Carlisle (Dem.) 168; Reed 7 (Rep.) 148; Brumm, 2. Of the four lade es pendents, Anderson of Iowa voted for Car le lisle, Nichols of North Carolina and Smith id of Wisconsin for Brumm, Hopkins of Vir. Se ginia not voting. Mr. Carlisle, on being i. escorted to the chair, delivered a quite ex at tended address, making the Treasury surplus in his theme, and advoeatiag a aiasles of the d revenue laws and a reduction of taxation. t This, however, he wanted done very care e fully, so as not to disturb investments made n or the laborers employed in their avocations, e which the reduction would affect. It was a i. carefully expressed, very guarded speech, a. for political effect, and was douatless in a tended to outline the poliey of the Demo d erate party, it perhaps being apprehended If by him that the President would cover the y matter with so much prolixity that the pub. i. lie would be unable to get at the subetanes.

An to yet it was a heartless abandonment for thea al while the pack was at his heels, to desei e- him who had guided them like a Moses fror he rotten Empire and ruthless Communism t nt a splendid government.

Assembly of 1851 dissolved Dec. 2d, and the be Imperial monarchy was established Dec. 2d ed 1852. And it was not intended as a coince dence by Grevy, the semi-revolutionary ac ad of the Assembly drining him to do prema e. turely on Friday that which he had desires ad to defer until Monday. There is probabl; ,'s nothing more than an odd coincidence in al at these things, but national coincidences have re great effect on affairs sometimes. jy *,' in The accession of M. Sadi Carnot, if I e. could be divorced from the enforced retire 1. ment of Grevy, might be a matter of con r. gratulation to France. There had been re a. action enough before Grevy's resignation ti id set aside all the prominent aspirants and 3. professional Intriguers and compel the selec r. tion of what we would call in America "a 9r dark horse." Ferry, who was nursing him. ," self as the heir apparent, and backed up b' it De Lesseps and the financiers who would 1e wreck France if necessary in making good is their investments in the Panama Canal Lt fraud, collapsed like a rent balloon. The A Opportunists were routed at the outset, and e a man with whom France, for the present at 1. least, seems satisfied, was elected. Russia, , the friend of France, declares satisfaction, e and Germany affects to consider him harm d less. There may be under the surface a d game not exposed to the world. Germany d and Russia have just found out, or pretend a to find out, that they are very warm friends, a and that some intermeddling forger had a created all the trouble between them. Now a comes a President of France regarded favor a ably by one and with cool indifference by the other. May it not mean a secret under. standing has been agreed upon by France, I Germany and Russia, and that the costly t military establishments maintained by all . three on a war footing are to be reduced and . the people allowed to retain some of their a substance from the tax gatherer? It were better so. I so It is an old saying, "We do these things better in France." Politically speaking, they do not. True, their theoretical periods of Presidential elections every seven years is better than ours every four, if the periods were observed. But their President is elected by the Congress, while ours are in directly elected by the people. The French Deputies are not elected on the issue of their preference for President, hence the people have practically no voice in naming him. Nor is his tenure longer, as instanced now, than the capricious Congress with ~he Influ ences of fickle and riotous Paris governing it, may determine. It Is a very weak JOInt In their Republic. They would do weli to amend their constitution. The instabilits' of such a goverument as apparent. France will not be a Republic many years if the precedent now established remains possible to be patterned after. It will never bear the strain of a single serious crisis.

PROHIBITORY LaIS COISTITUTIONn erify - ful." THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITE their STATES RENDERS AN IMPORT The Manufacture of Intoxicating Liquor. af, be Abolished as a Nuisance. Grevy WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.-A very importai pup de- decision, and one likely to be far reachic at the in its consequences, was rendered in ti ad the Supreme Court to-day In the so called Kai ec. 2d, asu prohibition cases of Mugler vs. the Stal colne. of Kansas, and the State of Kansas vs. Zie try act bold and others. The judgment of the con prema- was pronounced in a long and deliberat lesired opinion by Justice Harlan, who said: Tb obably general question in each case is whether tL in all prohibition statutes of Kansas are in conflit a have with the Fourteenth amendment, whic provides that no State shall make or enforc any law which shall abridge the privilege t, if it or immunities of the citizens of the Unite retire" States, nor shall any State deprive any pca f con. son of life, liberty or property without do en re- process of law. That legislation by th ion to State prohibition of the manufacture withl a and her limits of intoxicating liquors to be soli selec. or bartered for general use as beverages doe liea ta not necessarily infringe on any right, privl him. lege or immunities secured by the constitu up by lion of the United States is made clear b; would decisions of the court rendered before an good since the adoption of the Fourteenth amend Canal ment. It is, however, contended that al The though a state may prohibit the manufactur t, and of intoxicating liquors for sale within he eant at limits for general use, no convention o oasis, legislature has a right under our form o ation, government to prohibit any citizen fron harm. manufacturing for his own use or for expor raem a or storage any article of food or drink not many endangering or affecting the rights of others 'etend The argument made In support of the flrsi lends, branch of this proposition briefly stated is r had That in the Implied compacts between i Now State and the citizens certain rights are re ravor- served by the latter which are guarantee I by ce by constitutional provision for the protection nder- of life, liberty and property against depriva. ance, tion without ldue process of law and with ostly which the State cannot interfere; that among by all those rights is that of manufacturing fot I and one's own use either food or drink; that their while, according to the doctrine of the com were mune, a State may control the tastes, appe tites, habits, dress, food and drink of citizens, our system of government, based upon the bingo individuality and intelligence of the people, king, does not claim to control him except as to rinods his conduct to others, leaving him the sole are is judge as to all that only affects himself. It rids will be observed that the proposition and the ot is argument made in support of it equally con re in- cede that the right to manufacture drink for enub one's personal use is subject to the condition their that such manufacture does not endsnger sople the rights of others. If such manufacture him, does prejudicially affect the rights and in now, terests of the community it follows that nfu- that society has the power to protect itself ning by legislation against the injurious conse joint quences of that business. As was said in ill to Minn vs. Ellingers [94 U. S., 124] while the 411W power does not exist with the whole people 'ano to control rights- purely and exclusively the private the Goverament may require each Bible citizen to so conduct himself and to use his r the own property so as not to injure another. But by whom or by what authority is It to be determined whether the manufacture of particular articles of drink, either for general f 19n use or for the personal use of the maker, will u of Injuriously affect the public? The power to bile determine such questions so as to bind all ion. must exist somewhere, else society will be the at the mercy of a few who, regarding only mar, their own appetites or passions, may be ease willing to-imperil the peace and security of fotel the many, provided only they are permitted asin to doss they wish. Under our system that Jay power Is lodged with the legislative branch rt is of the Government. It belongs to that de ther partment to exert what are known as )he the police powers of the States. It must deter I to mine primarily what measures are appro the priate or needful for the protection of public He morals, health or safety, limits beyond asin which legislation cannot rightfully go. As ley. the court must obey the constitution rather era. than the law making departments of the ee Government, it must upon Its reponsibility rris determIne whether 'in any particular case ross these limits have been passed. The courts Fes. are at liberty to look at the substance of iota things, whenever they enter upon an inquiry rae whether the lauijiature has transcended the hat limits of its carthority, keeping in view those ily princilples as governing the relations with sm eacb other of the Judicial and Legislative ste- deparimenta of Goverutreot- matn-dese ts nin to perceive any ground for judicially declar tel, log that the prohibition by Kansas of the dam manufacture -or male within her lImits of the intoxicating Ilrqdors for general use there as ery a beverage Is not fakrly adapted to the end itel of protecting the community against evils and which confessedly result from the excessive If use of ardent spirits. We ceannot shut eat silr of view the fact that public health, morals the and pubtlc safety masy he endangered by the and general usee of intoxicating drinks. 199r cdo spe we ignore the fact that disorder, pauperisma my and crime, prevalent In the country, are in a di large measure directly traceable to those his evils.

Saussier- and the Paris garrison of 20,000 troops are on duty. The Assembly has passed through the most tumultuous day since the Commune. The Senate has i accused Grevyof high treason. Clemenceau and the radicals, Rochefort and the extrem ists are repenting their rashness, and are s shielding themselves behind the cry that the constitution is to blame. The reactionists are favoring Ferry, because they see in him 1i the most favprable Instrument of their resist- t ance to the Republic. The Patriot League t of 50,000 is almost in arms against Ferry, ea and the departments are thundering to pre serve the constitution in Grevy. 5' ROCnarORT DIZSGUSTED. Rochefort, the Gray Mephistophiles, talks earnestly, passing from group to group. We have had nothing like it since the Com mune, says be. The Chamber cannot force ri Grevy to resign, but it is trying to urge him di to some unconstitutional act, which would give them ground to condemn him for trea- K son. We are in danger of a revolution. The ti mob may march on the .Elysee at any mo ment and frighten him into resigning. It is pi all the fault of Ferry or our ridiculous con- i stitution.

PARIS, Dec. 2.-President Grevy's mes- M sage, resigning the Presidency of the Repub- bi lic, has just been read in the Chamber of m Deputies, which is as follows: "So long as I had only to contend with the difficulties M that have accumulated in my path, the St attacks of the press, the abstention of men St whom the public voice bad called to my side, and the increasing impossibility to co form a ministry, I struggled on and remained its where duty bade me. But at the moment Lb when public opinion, better informed, th marked a change, which gave me the hope by of forming a government, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies voted a double reso Intion, which, under the form of an adjourn ment to a fixed hour to await the President's promised message, is tantamount to sum moning the President to resign. It wonld be my duty and right to resist, but under sci the circumstances in which we are placed, a conflict between the Executive and Parlia- at ment might entail circumstances which Jo restrain me. Wisdom and patriotism com mand me to yield. I leave to those who assume it the responsibility for such a pre. m, cedent, and for the events that may ensue. L. I relinquish without regret, but not without tar sadness, the dignity to which I have been to twice raised without solicitation, and in the to exercising of which I feel conscious I have Si0 done my duty. To this I call France to Hy witness. For nine years my government Un has secured to the country peace, order and liberty; has made France respected through out the world; has worked unremittingly to raise her, and In the midst of an armed Europe, leaves her in a condition to defend de her honor and rights. Further than that, It are has been able to keep the public in the wise an internal coarse marked out by the Interests on and wishes of the country. In return for do this, I have been removed from the post where confidence placed me. In leaving his political life I form but one wish-it is that his the Republic may not be struck the blows ats aimed at myself, but that it may issue trium- Th phant from the dangers it Is made to Incur. out I place on the bureau of the Chamber of hin Deputies my resignation of the functions of call President of the French Republic." par A
