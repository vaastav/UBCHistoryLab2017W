Tho prime object of tho expedition was to destroy tho Weldon Railroad, over which supplies were brought in large quantities to Stony Creek, and thenco wagoned to Peters burg. In this it was entirely suc cessful, having destroyed the road for fifteen miles, sullering but little loss. Tho Richmond papers admit that the loss of the road will cause considera ble inconvenience. Warren's expe dition had returned to camp.

It is still doubtful whether he will do so, or make for the coast South East of the cit'. It is very certain he has uot yet opened coin munication with the const, though he may do so very soon. LATER. A tologram from below Charleston, states that Sherman was in battle. Wo will not say where, con fronted by a strong Confederate force. Another paper statos that there has been no direct communication with Savannah for several days, but we apprehend the wire has boon out be tween that and Charleston. lillO of U. S. GRANT.

About noon he made a grand charge carrying some of tho rebels' left center works, threatening to cut them oil' from tho city. An advance, of the whole line soon doub- led up the rebel formation, when they fell back in confusion to the immedi ate vicinity of the defenses around Savannah, our forces pursuing on both Hanks and center. Finding tho enemy's works quito strong, nnd his men being exhausted by the severe march of the previous night and the lighting of the day, (Jen. Sherman postponed further movements until the troops could rest. Sherman's losses are placed nt '2, 500, and that ot the rebels nt 4.000 to 5,000, including 1,200 prisoners, em bracing many officers of rank. Wo also took many colors, cannon, small arms, caissons and wagons. New Advertisements. tohItersI" m"pers"i 200O DoJais iiiC ;isIt TO PAY COB r tr T5i Don't soil your
