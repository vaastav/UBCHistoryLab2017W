<f Ijc iLlteltlü Ifjcralil. FISK BROS. - * - Publishers. S. E. FISK,......Editor THURSDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1888. SURELY there must be some less expen- , Hive and sensible remedy for differences j between employer and employe than strikes. _ We confess that we should have more expectation that the bill to admit South Dakota and Montana forthwith would pass both houses than that the President would approve it.___ With all its foolish chatter about a lack of water, one fact seems to be clearly established—there is always enough to submerge the organ opposite. No one has ever seen the day that it hadn t "water on the brain." Whenever our hydrants fail, tap the Independent head. Ox the occasion of his recent visit to Indianapolis Senator Farwell is said to have presented to President-elect Harrison the name of Col. Fred. Grant for the Chinese mission. It is not improbable Col. Grant will be the American Minister at the Celestial court under the Harrison ad ministration_ Ouk esteemed contemporary, the Inde pendent, has a system of its own for corral ing our mountain waters for purposes of irrigation. It says: "The construction of reservoirs is made comparatively easy by the existence of canons which, walled up at the two ends, would afford ample capacity for storage." Why, we inquire, i wall up "the two ends?" Wouldn't one end do ? _ If the Jamestown convention is as thor ough a representation of the feeling in North Dakota on division as the numbers would indicate, and the expression is strong and unanimous for division, as the sense and wish of men of both parties, per haps the Democrats will consent to the in evitable and save what good will lis possi ble for themselves from the people of the new States._ It was thought that the city had got rid finally and for good of the small pole nui sance which for years was used for wire purposes of one kind and another in various parts of the city. It seems our people are again to suffer from this infliction. Poles of the old telegraph size are being scattered along our principle streets. Who is doing it and for what purpose? Has anyone the authority to put these poles np for wire support? Who can answer? ! ! i a in In the early settlement of Virginia a pipe of tobacco was presented to a guest and he was requested to drink it. So it is said Sir Walter Raleigh drank a pipe before his execution. The proper manner of pre paring and nsing it in those earlier colonial days was "cut it upon a maple log, to keep it in a lily pot—a jar of white earth—and to light the pipe with a splinter of juniper or a live coal in a pair of silver tongs." When the Oregon boundary question was in dispute Senator McDnffie, of South Carolina, said it would require a tnnnel five or six hundred miles long under the Rocky Mountains to reach that country with a railroad; that the country itself was not worth a "pinch of snuff." Some of these despargers of Alaska may as well think of McDuffie's fate as a prophet and consider how they will look in future his ory. Mandebson's bill to establish at Wash ington some bureau or laboratory for the investigation of contagious and infectious diseases, is worthy of general approval. It will expose and abolish very much of the abounding quackery and will do much to prevent those panics which destroy ten times as much as the disease, oftentimes. The doctors may possibly think the pre scription from such a bureau would inter fere with their business, but life and health are above business considerations. Poor Alaska is worse off than the ter ritories, if such a thing were possible, for there is no law or recognized title to any thing, according to Governor Swiueford. Why could not Congress extend the gen eral laws of Washington Territory over Alaska until such time as it could be pro vided with a code of its own adoption. It may be difficult to decide what is best to do, but something mast be done, and Con gress alone can do it. Crimes of all kinds abound, and there is neither law or author ity to keep them in check. Election is over and we cannot refer to the administration's brave bearing towards Hayti a seeking for popularity. We are bound to think that it is a conscientious discharge of official duty such as a man is wont to feel when face to face with another of his own size. We do not wish to be understood as willing to pocket an affront or serious wrong from a weak nation, but magnanimity and large courage would best manifest themselves by being patient and forbearing in such cases and reserving any more considerable demonstrations for the most powerful nations. England has played the great bully so long that her example has diseased public sentiment in official circles. England's bombardment of Alexandria is one of the most humiliating and wanton cases ef destruction in modern times. His tory is full of such instances. Let os as a nation leave England a monopoly of such bullying, but carefully make ready to whip the bully when the proper time comes. Federation of Railroad Employes. Pittsburg, December 6. —A movement is on foot to organize a federation of all railroad employes in the United States ex cept conductors. A meeting to that end will be held in this city in January. It is expected to have 100,000 members. Among the features will be an insurance and strike fund. Strikes are to be controll ed by the general organization. is to is , j i 

TARIFF LEGISLATION. At first sight it would look like a waste of labor te spend the time of the present short session of Congress on the tariff bill, for the measure that could pass the Senate would stand a poor chance in the House that passed the Mills bill. But there is more ehaoce for the Senate bill to get through theHousethan would be supposed. Sam Randall is not only back in his place, but he is back in his influence reinforced by the discomfiture of his enemies in his own party. But the main »hing to be noticed is that Cleveland's influence has ! entirely disappeared. His threats no long ! er inspire fear and his promises form no foundation for hope. Those Democrats who voted for the Mills bill against their own conviction on the assuarnce that they should have a federal office, if their consti tuents rejected them, may well plead total failure of consideration and take another tack that in time will fill their sails with the breezes of popular favor. In the changed situation of things \. e do not believe the Mills bill could pass the House to-day. There are more politi cians than statesmen among the Demo cratic members, about a hundred to one, and consistency never was the politician's chief jewel. But while there is chance for the Sen ate bill in the House, it could not secure i the President's signature, nor a majority enough to pass it over a veto in either House. The only purpose, therefore, to be sub served by the present discussion is the per fecting of a bill that will accelerate the passage at the next session. In the Senate this work can go on well enough, for it can do more business in a day than the House does in a week. Another great difference of the situation is that members are through talking to the country and are ready to come down to business and vote according to conviction. 

RE-ELECTED. Old Montana friends will be glad to learn that Col. Wiley S. Scribner, Secretary of the Territory under the administration of President Grant, succeeds himself as Re corder of Cook county, 111. He was the unanimous nominee of the Republicans for a second term and was ie-elected by a ma jority of nearly 7,000. The Colonel has discharged the duties of Recorder for nearly four years and the second term soon to be entered upon covers an equal period of time. The office is a very important one, the staff of clerks under the Recorder num bering nearly 200, and the business of the several departments far exceeding in mag nitude that of any other office of the kind in the United States. Montana friends cordially congratulate the Colonel. The Pioneer Press correspondent, Carle, is in Washington, prospecting congressmen to find out what are the chances for the admission of Dakota. His latest convic tion is that the only bill hopeful of suc cess would be some modification of the omuibus bill, with possibly a provision for the division of Dakota, if New Mexico is added. That would make five new States in one bill, two of which the Democrats would hope to gain. The people of Montana will not certainly object to the inclusion of New Mexico. They know how to sympathize with any people suffering Territorial vassalage, American citizens only in name. If we had our choice and say, every Territory ex cept Utah and Alaska should be admitted forthwith, regardless of numbers. The chief thing to consider is the sacredness and importance of political rights and not the number of people to enjoy and exer cise them._ When our legislature meets, one of the earliest acts the members will be called upon to consider will be a memorial ask iog the earliest possible admission as a State under the constitution heretofore adopted. If this were prepared in advance, considered by the members generally, of both parties, and adopted with substantial unanimity, we apprehend that it wonld very much strengthen the hands of our delegate to secure our immediate admis sion along with South Dakota, leaving Notth Dakota, Washington and New Mex ico to come in under enabling acts a year hence. The idea of an inter-territorial conven tion, to agitate the admission of the Terri tories generally, would not be a bad idea. The governors of the Territories are sup posed to be interested to retard admission, but the Delegates in Congress are not. Why should not these elected representa tives of the pecple in the Territories get together and recommend some general action? Without considering the use of any violent means to break down the bars or crowd into the Union, it is confessedly true that in united and determined action there is greater assurance of success. If there is a reasonable prospect of passing an admission bill for Washington Territory, it is probable that Senator Stuart will not insist on his amendment to attach the Panhandle of Idaho to it. Idaho is coming out with good claims to national attention. Her vote at the last election was considerable larger than that of the State of Nevada, and while the latter seems to be on the decline, the former is steadily advancing. Rev. Samuel Fbaxcis Smith, the author of thoee two noble hymns, begin ning, "My Country, 'Tis of Thee," and "The Morning Light is Breaking," is still living at the age of 80. "America" was written in 1832 and first sung at a chil dren's celebration in the Park street church in Boston July 4th of that year. The author has been settled as a Baptist clergyman at Waterville, Me., and Newton, Mass. He has also done something at teaching and editorial work. But his title to fame rests chiefly and securely on those two grand old hymns, whose words seem alive with patriotic devotion. Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.' 

KEEP THE BALL IMOVING. The Jamestown, North Dakota, conven tion was a large and earnest body of men and meant business It matters little whether it were a mass or delegate conven tion. The main thiog is^ whether it repre sents the popu'ar sentiments and convic tions. Of this last there is no doubt. The movement of events is well indicated by the different phases presented every time the discussion is re newed. At first the people of the ! North did not care much for admission and ! still less for division. Now they want di vision and immediate admission as a' a State without any longer experience with .terri torial bondage. The people of North Dakota are right in all except that immediate admission .is im possible until a constitution is framed and accepted. The people of Montana have gone through with this preparatory stage and we are s> much in advance. The matter of holding an inter-Terri torial convention is one whose importance cannot be fully determined in advance. If the present Congress will do its full pres ent duty, there would be no need of the convention. It wonld admit at once those with constitutions already prepared, and wonld provide as soon as possible for con ventions to frame constitutions in other Territories. But it is all uncertain what this Congress may do, and any failure to act would be a sufficient ground to demand an extra session. At least all the machinery for getting to gether such a convention should be made ready, so that it could be set in motion as necessity may determine. Many things in dicate that the people of the Northern States realize as fully as we do the im portance of admitting the new States, und it is difficult to see what the Democrats can hope to gain by longer opposition. Helena wonld give a hearty welcome to the delegations of other Territories should the occasion call them together. Our leg islature will be in session through January and February, and it will be known before the latter month expiresjwhether Congress is going to do anything. Right after a presidential election is the best time to work for the admission of new States, and before the taking of a new census. We will get justice now if ever 1 If there is no opposition now we may be sure that it will be increased opposition later on. It seems impossible for the claims of any single Territory to secure consideration at the proper time on its merits. Through all our early history it was impossible to secure admission of a free State without a slave State to offset it in the Senate. Now it looks as if the pairing system was still to be insisted upon, If there should be developed a captious and unreasonable opposition and delay, it might be well for the several Territories to consider the question of adopting State governments and organizing, as did Mich igan and California, without any interven tion of Congress. A resolute and united determination to escape territorial thral dom will bring Congress to action. Pos sibly nothing else will. Scabce a day passes but there is an an nouncement of some gift or bequest of a fortune for 6ome new charity. To-day we hear that a Mrs. Rebecca E. Robertson, of New York, has left an estate of half a million to provide a home and the means to give the poor of that city a summer out ing. This is one of the charities that the newspapers of New York took up and com mended to public favor. It may seem a small thing to those accustomed to look out upou the clear sky and verdant earth to carry car loads or boat loads of ragged, dirty, hungry and sickly children ont from the dark and filthy alleys of the crowded city for a lew hoars' revel in the sanehine, bat it is like taking them into a new world, giving a new tarn to the whole life of bu idreds and drawing them away from a life of misery and vice. These sunshine missions from the slums of oar dark and crowded alleys are as important as any of the calls from "Greenland's Icy Mountains" or "India's Coral Strands." By the resignation of Perry Belmont the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Com mittee goes to McCreary, of Kentucky Our foreign affairs, under the present ad ministration, are chiefly in the bands of southern men, only recently in rebellion or in sympathy with it. It is not right in any consideration of the case. However, southerners may be natural diplomats, we have no use tor diplomacy as generally understood. We want men of high char acter, education and business skill, without any adventitious accompaniments of style, parade, etc. That is a sort of children's play, which we have outgrown. The managers of the Grand Army of the Republic are striving to belittle the protest that has come np from Democratic members all over the country against the covert interference of Republican poli ticians in the affairs of the organization.— Independent. A mole-hill magnified into a mountain. In number the dissidents are jnst about enough to form an awkward squad. The disgruntled Palmer, of Illinois, has been shamed to silence by veterans of the Grand Army of his own political faith. The Koontz coterie in Indiana, followers of the defeated Matson, conclnded on second thought they didn't want to enlist a Democratic Grand Army. Instead they decided to form a Democratic clnb. They can do this and still remain members of the Grand Army, which has no politics within the order. The Hoosier clnb will be fashioned after the order of the Union Veteran Club, com posed largely of Grand Army men, all of whom are Republicans, with purposes purely political. Deserting the False Prophet. Suakim, December 6.— Reports from Maasowah state that the powerful Ben and Bogus tribes have deserted the Mahdi and refused to assist in the siege of Sua kim. If the English troops defeat the rebels other tribes will also probably desert. THE Y. M. C. A. It is understood that a crisis has come in the affairs of the Young Men's Christian Association in this city, and the impend ing question is, Shall it be sustained or abandoned? The idea of abandoning it is disagreeable. It is a case of having taken hold of the plow and locking back. It seems as if it would have been better uot to have begun, than having begun to de sert the advanced position. The scale of effort and expense has been laid out to conform to the importance of the work to be accomplished aud the personal enthusi asm of a few earnest men, but uot in ac cord with any permanent resources. Our men of wealth are accessible to good, gen erous impulses, but to keep up a steady contribution year after year requires some thing more solid aud durable than impulse. It needs principle and established convic tions of duty, such as but few possess. We hope the work will by no means be abandoned. It seems as if the proper thiug to do is to cut down expenses to a safe, sure basis of reliable income and trust to growth of resources and activities as the community increased in numbers, wealth and Christian principles. When a veesel has had its sails rent to tatters in a storm the crew does not abandon the ship, bat patches up the fragments aud spreads to the breeze all the canvas that it has, content to make thiee knots an hour if ten knots is no longer possible. We re member well that our city library started ont with just as full sails aud there seem ed no eud to the money that could be had for the object. The canvas was spread wide for a twelve-month, bat then the waters shoaled fast and the sound of breakers indicated close approach to a rocky coast. Before the wrecl^ came the course was turned and the ship with a modest portion of the cargo was saved. It became a pride and power in our city, when a fire came that destroyed it all. But in the years of its humble and useful mission it had made friends that would not let it die. It has now been per manently endowed and has interwoven itsell with the very fibre of our daily ex istence. We have never known an instance of any kind, depending upon annual subscrip tion, no matter how high and worthy the purpose, that did not encounter seasons of dronth and famine. When such times come the highest duty is uot to despair, but to save what is possible from the wreck and set sail again with shortened canvas, tak ing frequent soundings. We are not sur prised at the crisis tbat has come. It was only a question of time. If we had a dozen Colonel Birds it would have come. Such a charitable institution needs a permanent endowment—a place to stand and work without the constant passiug around of the hat for means to pay reut. The day will come when the hat will come back empty, if it comes at all. Every in stitution ought to provide for such days, if it expects a continued existence. The work must not stop. The quarters insy be changed from larger to smaller, from dearer to cheaper. The laborers may be changed from hired regular ones to volun teer aud occasional ones, but the good work must go on and its friends will rally and days of prosperity will retnrn. Then wi 1 be the time to make some permanent pro vision. Possibly some one of our many men of wealth will recognize the Bplendid opening to erect a monament of enduring praise to endow the Helena Y. M. C. A. ior all time. How strange that this is not thought of of by those who are rich, and tbat those who do think of it, don't get rich! 

NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE OF FICE. Senator Blair seems to be the author or medinm of introducing into congress measures to embody every philanthropic idea tbat looks well upon its face. We think be often overdoes the business, as he did in tbat act requiring that all schools in the Territories should specially teach the evils of drinking and smoking. It strikes us much the same in regard to his contem plated bureaus of information. It will create another batch of offices to be filled and this tendency is to be discour aged. It seems to be forgotten that we bave newspapers and that their agents go everywhere in search of news of all kinds and spread it everywhere forthwith. Why ? Ten thousand bureaus of information could not do half as mach as our newspapers are doing right along. Government officers with assured liberal salaries do not possess the enterprise of the newspaper employe working for daily bread and reputation. It may be contended that the random in formation of newspapers is not reliable. Publicity is the sorest method of insuring truth and reliability. Admitting all the itching for sensationalism, the constant dread of exposure of every falsehood, loss of reputation and business, act as a guaran tee to the pnblic, to say nothing about the liability for libel suits. For anything that requires dispatch and inventive enterprise, the government is outdone every time. Look at our census information—one volume first issued eight years after it was gathered ! What is it good for when it comes out ? It is like getting to the depot an hour after the train has left. There L. much well-founded dissent from the tendency of government towards fra ternalism. People mast learn to depend on themselves for most things in order to gain self-reliance and independence. But the main objection to the govern ment taking this matter in hand ia that it coaid not after its cost and trouble keep up with the newspaper press or do half as mach work._ Southwest Rate War. New York, December 6. —It transpires that at the meeting of directors of the Missouri Pacific, yesterday, dissatisfaction was expressed with the condition of affairs in the Southwest. An order was passed for the immediate restoration of rates and a conference with other roads looking to an end of the disastrous war. Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria. IN CONGRESS. SENATE. Washington, December 6.—A state ment from the director of the mint in re sponse to Senator Stewart's resolution of last session as to the amount of silver bul lion offered monthly to the government since 1878, was presented and ordered printed. A communication from the Secretary of State, with a certified copy of the final as certainment of the Presidential electors in Kansas, was presented. The presidiug officer asked the opinion of the Senate) this being an entirely new proceeding) as to the disposition to be made of the papers, whether they would be entered ou the journal or placed in the archives of the Senate. They were finally referred to the committee on privileges and elections. The Senate resumed the consideration of the tariff bill beginning with earthenware and glassware. McPherson said, to his mind, the rates of dnties provided for in the Senate bill were an increase on exist ing rates of more than ten per cent. His own State was largely interested in those industries but didn't believe they neet'^d the amount of protection proposed. The Mills bill, be thought, accorded to them all the protection they needed. UNO amendment was made to that sche dule, and the schedule relating to metals was taken up. Plumb moved to reduce the rate on beams, girders, joists, from one and one tenth cents a pound to eight-tenths. HOUSE, Formai notice of the resignation of Per ry Belmout to accept the ministry to Spain was received. The report of the committee ou the President's message, referring its parts to appropriate committees, was received. The House went into committee of the whole, (Springer in the chair,) ou the di rect tax bill. 

HOUSE. Washington, December 7.—It was or dered when the House adjourned to-day it be till Monday. The committee ou appropriations re ported the invalid pensions appropriation bill. Referred to the committee of the whole. The committee on elections submitted a report in the South Carolina contested election case of Smalls against Elliott. Calendar. It finds in favor of Elliott. The minority resolution provides for the ser.t iog'of Smalls. House went into committee of the whole on the private calendar, the pend ing basisess being the Senate bill to incor porate the Nicaragua Canal Co. Spinall, of New York, offered an amend ment, striking out the clause which auth orized the company to exercise such pow ers as had been conferred upon it by the government of Nicaraugua. If this was to be a stock jobbing affair, he said, the sooner it was known the better. No one knew what agreement between Nicaragua and the company was. Cox, ot New York, who ex pressed .ignorance of the facts upon which his colleagne predicted his statement tbat this was a stock jobbing affair. He urged the im portance of its passage from a commercial tandpoint. Farquhar, of New York, de clared it would place in the bands of the United States the key of the South Amer ican and Indian trade. Let the United States show to the Congress of the three Americas which would soon meet iu this city, that instead of empty phraseology of the resolution of the community and good will of the gov ernment bas .opened to the two Americas sonth of the United States a highway cost ing $100,000,000, backed by the sentiment of the Fiftieth Congress. [ Applause.] Adams, of Illinois, contended tbat the clause which the amendment proposed to strike out didn't confer any dangerous au thority and that it was neceseary in order that the work should be succesfully accom plished. Spinola said all he desired with regard to this bill was that it should be perfected. He did not want to lend himself to the passage of a bill which would oue day rise up and haunt Congress. It might make this government financially responsible. Reed, of Maine, denied this. Alaskan Coal Monopoly. Washington, December6.—Gov. Swine ford, of Alaska, in a letter to the Secretary of the Interior, represents that through what he believes to have been, to say the least, an absurd decision of the late Jndge of the U. S. Court for Alaska, private parties have secured possession of the gov ernment wharf at Sitka and now monopolize the coal trade. He says vessels of the Pacific Coast Steamship Co. refuse to land coal for anybody but parties in possession of the wharf, and they iu consequence are extorting exorbitant prices. The Governor asks that the senior naval officer, stationed there, be authorized to supply the civil authorities with coal at cost. Investigating Alaska. Washington, December 7.— The House committee on merchant marine and fisheries has determined to take action relative to the alleged perpetration of ontrages upon \he persons of females aud restraint of liberty said to exist in Alaska. At the last session of Congress a committee was au thorized to make an investigation into the far seal fisheries of Alaska and inquire whether the contract allowing the Alaska Seal Company the exclusive right to take fur seals had been violated, etc. Congress adjourned before the investiga tion had been concluded and the commit tee then was unable to report At the meeting to-day the committee determined before making a report it wonld call before it the persons making the statements con cerning the condition of afiairs said to exist in Alaska and examine them upon the subject at an early date. Barrows of Michigan. Washington, December 7.—A united delegation from Michigan will arge the choice of Congressman Barrows for Speaker of the Fifty-first Congress. UNDER ORDERS. U nited States War Ships to Sail for Hayti. WASHINGTON, December 7.— Secretary Whitney this morning admitted frankly that he had ordered three naval vessels got ready as soon as possible to start for Hayti. He added, "the Haytian authori ties referred the case of the seized steamer Haytiau Republic to the government. We have reached a decision and tbat in short is, they have got to give her up. It was unfortunate that yellow fever broke out on the Boston while was at Port au Prince and compelled to leave that climate, otherwise the matter might have been set tled before no. Secretary Whitney yesterday sent tele graphic instructions to Rear Admiral Gherard, commandant at the New York Navy Yard, to bave the ships Richmond and Yantic prepared for sea as rapidly as possible. The idea is have them ready so they can sail direct for Hayti early next week. Orders have also been issued for Rear Admiral Luce, commandiug the North Atlantic Squadron, to t-ansftr his Hag from the Galena tc the Richmond, and use that vessel as his flagship of the expe dition. Orders were issued this afternoon to the commandant of the Norfolk navy yard to prepare the U. S. steamer Ossipee for sea service as soon as possible. She will be | sent to Port au Prince unless something ' happens in the meantime to render it un- r necessary. Secretary Endicott had an in terview with Secretary Whitney this morning, and a rumor started that it had been decided to send a number of troops to Hayti to assist the uaval forces, but sub sequently it was ascertained that there was no foundation for the report. Washington, December 7.—It is learned this afternoon that the action of Secretary Whitney in ordering a fleet of vesiels to prepare for an expedition to Hayti is due, not so much to the refusal on the part of that government to comply with the re quest to release the American vessel seized, as to the dilatory tactics adopted by the Haytian authorities in dealing with the question. The position taken by this gov ernment is understood to be that as the Haytian authorities referred arbitration of the case to this government they are vir tually bound by its decision, and that when they were informed by this govern ment that they had no legal right to seize and detain the Haytien Republic they should have accepted the situation aud re leased the vessel. While they have not refused to do this they are, it is said, acting in such a procrastinating way as to indi cate a strong disinclination to accept the judgment against them. STATEHOOD. Action at Jamestown, Dakota---In ter-Territorial Convention Proposed. Jamestown, Dak., December 6. —At the statehood convention last evening, resolu tions were adopted favoring the division of Dakota Territory on the seventh parallel, and the immediate admission of the north ern portion into the Union as North Dako ta. In case the present Congress fails to provide for admission the President-elect is requested to call special session of Congress for the purpose. Sonth Dakota, Montana and Washington are respectively invited to co-operate with the committee chosen to arrange for an inter-territorial convention, which will probably be called at Helena, Montana. As to Chinese. Washington, December 6. —Assistant Secretary Maynard, in a letter to the Col lector of Customs at San Francisco, says: While the Chinese merchants are not af fected by the Chinese exclusion act, the department must decline to issue instruc tions in regard to the manner of identify ing Chinese merchants on their arrival in the United States. He says also in regard to the department's previous instructions relating to certificates which may, for con venience, be issued to Chinese persons other than laborers : that the collector has full authority to disregard them, especially so in view of his intimation that sach cer tificates are fraudulently used by Chinese laborers. Pacific Railroad Bills. Washington, December 7. —The House committee on the Pacific roads has decid ed to press the consideration of the Pacific railroad funding bill at as early a day as possible. Oath waite, chairman of the com mittee, is confident of the passage of the bill by a good majority. If it can be brought to a vote, the work of the commit tee be will practically completed. Several bills relating to Pacific railroads are before it, bat as there is no possibility of their being taken up by the House at this late day it is probable no action will be taken upon them by tha committee. It Cut the Rates. Chicago, December 7.—A statement published this morning is to the effect that the Michigan Central railroad has been making a secret cut in rates on grain to the east. This cansed an investigation by the leading officers of the raad. They as sert that the road is the victim of a con spiracy between one or more of its clerks and a representative of a prominent board of trade firm, by which grain was shipped at a concession of 2] cents per bushel from the regular rate. Forgery is charged in connection with the matter, and the Mich igan Central people threaten sensational developments. Heavy Merchandise Shipment. New York, December 7.— The largest shipment of freight ever forwarded to the West at one time to oue consignee will leave this city to-night. It is composed of two special trains, one of twenty-three cars loaded solid with dry goods consigned to a new firm in Tacoma, W. T., and the other eixteen can loaded with coffee. It is expected to make the trip in twenty days. The shipment is valned at $200,000. Sale of Horses. New Yobk, December 6.—The sale of a portion of the Dwyen Bros.' stable was begun to-day. The following prices were realized: Tea Tray, $2,400; Fallston, $3,900; Prospect, $500; Hemlock, $535; Paris, $350.
