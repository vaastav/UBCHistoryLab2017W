To tho Senate and House of Representatives: In coming before you fortlie first time as Cliiet' Magistrate of this Great nation, it is with great grat itude to the Giver of all good for the innii' benefits we enjoy. We are blessed with noaco at home, and aro without entangling allian ces abroad to furebotlo trouble ; witli a territory unsurpassed in fer tility, of an area equal to the abund ant support of livo hundred mil lions of people, and abounding in every variety of useful mineral, in quantity sullicient to supply tho world for generations ; with exu- berant crops; with a variety of climate adapted to tho production of every species of earth a riches, and suited to the habits, tastes and requirements ot every living i ing ; ndlh n nM.nlntinn flf fllrtv millions I .. .w. J of free people, all speaking one language ; with facilities for every mortal to acquire an education ; with itstitntious closing to none the avenues to fame or any bless ing of fortune that may be coveted; with freedom of pulpit, tho press and the school ; with a revenue llowing into the National Treasury beyond the requirements of Gov ernment supply. Harmony is be ing rapidly restored within our own borders; manufactures hith erto unknown in our country are springing up in all directions, pro ducing a degree ol national inde pendence unequaled by that of any other rower. These blessings, and countless others, aro submitted to your care, and mine, tor safe keeping for the brief period of our tenure of office. In a short time we must each of us return to tho ranks of the people who have conferred upon us our honors, aud account to them lor our stewardship. I earnestly de sire that neither you nor I may be condemned by a free and enlight ened constituency, nor by our own conscience. Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic magnitude; aided, as it was, by tho sympathy and assist ance of nations with which we were at peace, eleven States of the Un ion wero four years left without legal Str.te government. A debt had been contracted. American com merce was almost driven from the seas ; the industry of one-half of tho country had been taken from the control of the capitalists, mid pl iccd whore all labor rightfully belongs in the keeping of the laborer. The work of restoring State Gov ernments loyal to the Union, of protecting aiitl fostering free labor, and providing for paying tho inter est on tho public debt, has receiv ed amplo attention from Congress. Although these measures have not met with tho success in all partic ulars that ought to have been de served, yet on the whole they have been more successful than could have been reasonably anticipated. Seven Stales which passed ordi nances of secession have been fully restored to their placos in the Un ion. The eighth, Georgia, held an election at which she ratified her Constitution, republican in form, elected a Governor, members of Congress, a State Legislature, and all other ollieors required. The Governor was duly installed, and the Legislature met and lormed all the acts then required of them by tlie Reconstruction Act of Congress. Subsequently, however, in viola tion of the Constitution which they had just ratified, as sinco decided by the Supremo Court of the State, they unseated tho colored members of the Legislature, and admitted to seats some members who are dis qualified by the third clause of the fourteenth' amendment to the Con stitution, an article which they themselves had contributed to rat ify. Under these circumstances, l would submit to you whether it would, not bo wise without delay, to enact a law authorizing the Gov ernor of Georgia, to convene the members originally elected to the Legislature, requiring each member to take the oath presented by the Reconstruction Act, and none to be admitted who are ineligible un der the third clauso of the Four teenth Amendment. The freedmen, under the protec tion which they have received, are makine rapid nrooress in learning, and no complaints are heard of lack of industry on their part, when they receive fair remuneration for their labor. The means provided for paying the interest on the public debt, with all other expenses of the Govern ment, are more than ample. The loss of our commerce is the only result of the late rebellion which has not received sufficient attention from you. To this sub ject I call your earnest attention. I will not now suggest plans by which this object may be effected, but will, if necessary, make it the subject of a special message during the session of Congress. At the March term, Congress, by a joint resolution, authorized the Executive to order elections in, the States of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas, to submit to them the Constitutions which each had pre- 

COUNTY DEVOTED TO l'OLlTICS, GENERAL" NEWS AND HOME INTEREST. viously in Convention framed, find submit the Constitution, cither en tire or in separate parts, to lie vot ed on at the discretion of the Ex ecutive. Under this authority, elections were called. In Virginia the elee tion took place on the litli of July, 1809. The Governor and Lieuten ant Governor elected have been in stalled ; the Legislature met and did all.requircd by the resolution, and by all the reconstruction acts of Congress, and abstained from all doubtful authority. I recom mend that her Senators and Rep resentatives be admitted to : seats, and that the State he fully restored jt() jt3 plnce in the family of St.nteg. Elections were called in Missis sippi and Texas to commence on the 30th of November, 1809, and t0 ast tw0 (ilva ; Mississippi and four days in Texas. The elections lave taken place, but the result is not known. It is to be hoped that the acts of the Legislatures of these States, when they meet, will be such as to receive your apiobation, and thus close the work of reconstruc tion. Among the evils growing out of the rebellion, and not yet referred to, is that of an irredeemable cur rency. It is an evil which I hope will receive your most earnest at tention. It is a duty, ami one of the highest duties of the Govern ment, to secure to the citizens a medium of exchange of fixed, un varying value. This implies a re turn to a specie basis, and no sub stitute for it can bo devised. It should be commenced now, and reached at the craliest practicable moment consistent with a fair re gard to the interest of the debtor class. Immediate resumption, if piacticable, would not be desired. It would compel tho debtor class to pay beyond their contracts the premium on gold at the date of the purchase, and would bring bank ruptcy to thousands. Fluctuations, however, in the paper value of the measures of all values, gold, is de trimental to the interests of trade; it makes tho man of business an involuntary gambler; for in all sales, which future payment is to be made, both parties speculate as to what will bo tho value ol tlie currency to be paid and received. I earnestly recommend to you then, such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments, and put an immediate stop to fluct uation in the value of currency. The methods to secure these results are as numerous as are the specu lators on political economy. To secure tho latter I see but one way, and that is to authorize the Treas ury to redeem its own paper at a fixed price whenever presented ; to withhold from circulation all such currency redeemed until sold again for gold. The vast resources of the nation, both developed and undeveloped, ought to make our credit the best on the earth. With less burden of taxation than the citizens have en dured for six years past, the en tire public debt could be paid in ten years ; but it is not desirable that the people should be taxed to pay it in that time. Year by year tho ability to pay increases in a rapid ratio; but the burden of in terest ouglit to be retluceu as rap idly as can be done without the vi olation of contract. The public debt is represented, in great part, by bonds having from five to twen ty and from ten to forty years to run, bearing interest at me rate oi six per cent, ami live per cent, re spectively. It is optional witli ttie Government to pay their bonds at any period after tho expiration of tho last time mentioned upon their faces. The time has already ex pired when a great part of them may be taken up, and the time is rapidly approaching when all may be. It is believed that all which are now due may bo replaced by bonds bearing a rate of interest not exceeding four and a half per cent ; and as rapidly as the remain der becomes duo, that they may be replaced in the same way. To ac complish this it may be necessary to authorize the interest to be paid at cither of three or four of the money centers of Europe, or by anv Assistant Treasurer of the Uni ted States at the option of the hold er of the bonds. 1 suggest this subiect for tho consideration of Congress ; also, simultaneously with this the propriety of redeeming our currency, as before suggested at its market value at lue time tho law goes into effect, increasing at the rate at which currency will be bought and sold from day to, day or week to week, at tho same rate of interest as the Government pays. upon its bonds. Tho subject of tariff and inter nal taxation will necessarily re ceive your attention. The rcvo uues of tho country are greater than the requirements, and may, with safety, be reduced. But as tho funding of tho debt in a four or a four and a half per cent, loan would reduce the annual current expenses largely, thus, alter fund ing, justifying a greater reduction of taxation than would be now ex pedient, I suggest a postponement of this question until tho next meet ing of Congress. It may be advisable to modify taxation And the tariff in instances where unjust or burdensome dis criminations are made by the pres ent laws ; but a general revision of the laws Regulating this subject I recommend the postpomeiiniit of for the present I also sfiggesttho renewal of the tax on incomes, but at a reduced rate say .three per cent. and this tax to expire in three years. Willi the funding of the national debt as Iqere suggested, I feel safe in saying? the taxes and revenue from imports may be reduced, safe ly, from ixty to eighty millions per annufii at once, and be still further reduced from year to year, as the resfaurees of the country are developer The report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows the receipts of the Government for the h'soal year ending Jime 30, 1809, to be 8370, 613,747, snd the expenditures, in terest, bounties, &c., to be 321, -41)0,597. fThe estimates for the ensuing year arc mora favorable to tho Government, and will, no doubt, sh0w a large decrease of public debt. The receipts into the Treasury; beyond expenditures, have exceeded the amount necessa ry to place to the credit of the Sinking Fund, as provided by law. To lookup the surplus in the Treasury Jl; and withhold it from circulation, would lead to such con traction of the currency as to crip ple trade, and seriously alfect the prosperity; of the country. Under these ciromnstances the Secretary of tho Treasury and myself hearti ly concurred in the propriety of using all tho surplus currency in the Treasury in the purchase ol Government tends, thus reducing the interest-bearing debt of the country, and of submitting to Con gress the question of the disposi tion to bo made of the bonds so purchased. Tlie bonds now held by the Treasury amount to about 875,000,000, including these be longing to the Sinking Fund. I recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the Sinking Fund. i Your attention is respectfully in vited to tho recommendations of the Secretary of tho Treasury for the creation of the olllcer of Commis sioner of Customs Revenue ; for the incro.ise.flf salary to certain classes of oflieiaTsTand the substitution" of increased National Bank Circula lion, to replace the outstanding three ner cent, certificates, and most especially to his recommenda tions for the repeal of laws allow ing shares of lines, pensions, for feitures, &c, to officers of the Gov ernment, or to mlormers. The olllce of Commissioner ot Internal Revenue is one of the most arduous and responsible un der tho Government it falls but little, if any, short of a Cabinet po sition in its importance and respon sibilities. I would ask for it, therefore, such legislation as, in your judgment, will place tho olllce on a tooting ot dignity ecommen surato with tho importance, and with a character and qualifications of the class of men required to fill it properly. As the United States is the freest of all nations, so, too, its people sympathize with, all people strug gling for liberty ana sen-government. But while so sympathizing- it is due to our honor that we should abstain from enforcing our views imon unwilling nations, and from taking an interested part, without invitation, in the quarrels between different nations, or be tween Governments and their sub jects. Our course slioulu always be in conlormity witli sirict justice and law, international and local. Such has been tlie policy ol tne Administration in dealing witli these questions. For more than n year a valuable province of Spain, and a near neighbor ol ours, in wnom an om people can not but feel a deep in terest, has been struggling for in dependence and freedom. The people and Government of the United States entertain the same warm feelings and sympathies for the pooplo of Cuba, in their pend ing struggle, that they manifested throughout the previous struggles between Spain and her former colo nies, in behalf of the latter. But the contest at no time assumed the conditions which amount to war, in the sense of international law.or wliir-h would show the existence of a ile facto political organization of .:....,. l,,.i;(,. tlie insurgents Hiuneieui, w jusm.i recognition of belligercncj'. The principle is maintained, nuu;, that this nation is its own judge when to accord the rights of bellig erency, either to a. people strug- o-lino- to free themselves from a government they believe to be op pressive, or to independent na tions ot war with each other. Tlie United States has no disposition to interfere with tho existing relation of Spain to her colonial possessions on this continent. They believe that in due time Spain and othor European Powers will find their in terest in terminating these relations aud establishing their present do- HEI iALD. pendencies as independent powers i tlie property of a nation with which members of the family of na-! we were at peace, on a mere Flec tions. The dependencies are no ! "tive order, the matter lias been re longer regarded as subjects U'M1 to the CourU to decide, transfer from one Kuronenn Power The conduct of the allies nnd the to another.

The United States, in order to put a stop to bloodshed inCuba,and in the interest of a neighboring peo pic, proposed their good olDces to ! bring the existing contest to a tcr- j mii.otinn Tl, nv.i- nr.r hoino- nc- copied by Spain on n basis wliich wo io over onn i hp lew- vel iv,tliniun oi luc ucaiy ni-ic imiu.ui- Cuba, was withdrawn. It is honed that the good offices of the United Suites may yet prove advantageous for the settlement of this unhappy strife. Meanwhile a number of illegal expeditons against Cuba have been irokcn up. It has been the en deavor of the Administration to execute the neutrality laws in good faith, no matter how unpleasant the task, made so by the suffering we have endured from lack of like good faith toward us by other na tions. Tho United States schooner Liz zie Major was arrested on the high seas by a Spanish frigate, and two pasengers taken from it, and car ried as prisoners to Cuba. Repre sentations of these facts were made to the Spanish Government as soon as ollicial mtormation oi mem reached Washington. The two passngers wero set at liberty, and the Spanish Government assured the United States that the captain of the frigate, in making the cap ture, had acted without law; that ho had been reprimanded for thej irregularity of his conduct, and that the Spanish authorities in Cuba, would not sanction any act Mat could violate tho right or treat with disrespect the sovereignty of the nation. ' The question of the seizure of the brig Mary Lowell, at one of the Bahama Islands, by the Spanish authorities, is now the subject of correspondence between this Gov ernment and that of Spain aud Great Britain. The Captain Gen eral of Cuba, about May last, issued a proclamation authorizing scarcli to be made of vessels on the high seas. Immediate remonstrance was " mafle against tills, -whereupon the Captain General issued a new proclamation, limiting the right of search of vessels of the United States so lar as autuorizecl under the treaty of 1795. This procla mation, however, was immediately withdrawn. I have always felt that the most intimate relations should be culti vated between the Republic of the United States and all independent nations on this continent. It may bo well worth considering whether new treaties between the United States and them, may not be profitably entered into, to secure more intimate relations, friendly, commercial and otherwise. The subject of an interoceanic canal, to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, through the Isth mus of Darien, is one which com merce is greatly interested in. In structions have been given to our Minister to the Republic of the United States of Colombia to en deavor to obtain authority lor a survey, by their Government, in order' to determine the practicabili ty of such an undertaking, and a charter for the right of way, to build, by privato enterprise, such work, if the survay proves to be practicable. In order to comply with the agreement of the United States, as to a mixed commission at Lima.tor the aiustnieiit of claims, it became necessary to send a commissioner and secretary to Lima, in August last. No appropriation having been made by congress for this purpose, it is now asueti unit one be made, covering tne past ana iu- turc expenses of the commission. The good olllce ot tlie unuea States to Dnng auotu a piece uu tween Spain aud the South Ameri can Republics, with which she is at war, having been accepted by bpain Peru and Chili, a. Congress has been invited to be held in Wash inn-ton during the present wm- -o o ter. A grant has been made to Euro peans of an exclusive right to tran sit over the territory of Nicaragua, to which, it is alleged, conflicts with the vested rights of citizens of the United States; the Department of State has now this subject under consideration. The Minister of Peru having made representations that there was a state of war between Peru and Spain, and that Spain was building, in and near New York, thirty gun boats, which might be used by Spain in such a way as to relieve .. tho naval force at Cuba, so as to operate against Pern, orders were given to prevent their departure. No further steps having been ta ken by the representative of the Peruvian Government to prevent the departure of these vessels, and I, not feeling authorized to detain

Toward the close of the last Ad ministration, a Convention was signed at London for the settle ment of all outstanding claims be tween Great I'r'.tain and tin United States, which failed to receive the advice and consent of the Senate to its ratification. The time and the circumstances attending tlie nego- al"c to Us acceptance liy me peo P'e of the United States, and its provisions were wnon.v u .lucqiiaie , for the settlement of the : grave wrong tliat liaa Deen sustained oy this Government, as well as by its . citizens. The injuries resulting to 1 the United States by reason of the j course adopted by Great Britain ; during the late civii war, in increas-I ed rates of insurance: in the dim! nution of exports and imports, and other distinctions to domestic in dustry and production ; in its ef fect upon the foreign commerce of tho country : in the decrease and transfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine; iu the prolon gation of the war, and the increas ed cost, both in treasure and in lives, of its suppression, could not be adjusted and satisfied as ordina ry commercial claims which con tinually arise between commercial nations; and yet the Convention treated them simply as such ordi nary claims, from which they differ more widely in the gravity of their cliaracter tnan in tne magnitude; oi their amount, great even as is that difference. Not a word was tound in tlie treaty, ana not an in ference could be drawn from it, to remove the sense of the unfriendli ness of the course ot Great Britain our struggle for existence, whic h so deeply and universally impressed itself on the people ot tlie country. Believing that a convention thus misconceived m its scope, and in adonuate in its provisions. Would not have produced tne Hearty cor dial settlement ot pending ques tions which alone is consistent with the relations which I desire to have estableshed between the United States and Great Britain, I regard ed the action of the Senate in re jecting the treaty to have been wise ly taken, in the interest ot eace, and as a necessary step in the di rection of a perfect and cordial friendship between the two coun tries. Sensitive people, conscious of their power, are more at case imdera great wrong wholly una- toned than under the restraint of a settlement which satisfies neither their ideas of justice nor their grave sense of the grievance tuey have sustained. The rejection of the treaty was followed by a state of public feeling on both sides which 1 thought not favorable to an immediate attempt at renewed negotiations. I accord ingly so instructed thc Minister of the United States to Great Brittain, and found that my views in this re gard were shared by Her Majesty's Minister. I hope that the time may soon arrive when the two govern ments can approach the solution of this momentous question with an assurance of what is due to the rights, dignity and honor of each, and with the determination not only to remove the causes of com plaint in the past, but to lay the foundation of a broad principle of public law, which will prevent fu ture differences, and tend to firm and continued peace and friend ship. This is now the only grave question which the uniteu oiaies have with any foreign nation. The Question of a treaty for re ciprocity between the United States and tho British Provinces on this continent, has not been favorably considered by the Administration. The advantage of such a treaty would be wholly iu favor of the British producer, except possibly, a few engaged in the trade between tho two sections. JNo ci tho United States would be benefit ed by reciprocity. Our internal taxation would prove a protection to the British producer, almost equal to the protection of the tariff. Some arrangement, however, for the regulation of commercial in tercourse between the United States and the Dominion of Canada may be desirable. The Commission for adjusting the claims of the Hudson's Bay and Puget's Sound Agricultural Company upon the Un.tod States, has terminated its labors. The award of StwO.OOO has been made, and all rights and titles of the com pany on the territory of the United States have been extinguished. Deeds for thc property of the com pany have been received. An ap- I 1... proprnuiou u.y vuujjicss uu-. this sum is asked. The commissioners for determin ing the northwestern land bounda ry of the United States and the Brit ish possessions, under tne iieay ui 185G, hart: completed their labors, and the commission has been dissolved. In conformity with tho recom mendation of Congress, a proposi tion was early mado to thu liritihli Government to abolish tho mixed courts, created under tlie treaty of April 7, 1802, for tho suppression of the slave trade. The subject la still under negotiation. It having come to my knowledge ' that a corporate company, organ ized under British laws, proposed to land on tho shores of thu United States, ond to operate here, a sub marine cablo, under a concession from His SIjety, the Emperor of tho French, of an exclusive right for twenty years of telegraphic communication, between the shores of France and the United States, With tlie ril.hv-tinniil.lo fnnf,M-.u nf autijfotiiig all message, conveyed thereby to the sovereignty and tliU eontrol of the French Government. I caused the French and .British legations at Washington to he uiado acquainted with the probable poli cy of Congress on the subject, as foreshadowed hy the bill which passed the Senate in March last. This drew from the representatives of tho company an agreement to accept ns the basis of thei" oper ations the provisions of the bill, or of such other enactment on the sub ject as might bo passed du'ing the approaching session of Congress; alft0i to ma their influence to secure from t10 Frcncn Government a no tification of their concession, so as to permit the Coding npon French goil of any cabi belonging to any ,.0,llnanv iof)r,,r)rntG(i t.v the .,. tnorjtJ of t10 rnifej StatpS) orof any Stute jn thc Tjn!on . and on tileir . t ,0 onose e-tabliali- ment of any such cable. In con sideration of thi3 agreement, I di rected the withdrawal of all oppo sition hy the Now York authorities to the landing of the cable, and to the working of it, until the meeting of Congress. I regret to say that there has been no modification, I made in the Company's concession ; nor, as far as I can learn, have they attempted to secure one. Their concession excludes the capital and the citizens of the United. States from competition upon the shores of France. I recommend legisla tion to protect the rights of citizens of the United States, as well as the dignity and sovereignty of the na- ition agaiust glK.n an assumption.

The unsettled political condition of other countries less fortunate than our own, sometimes induces their citizens to come to the United States for the sole purpose of be coming naturalised. Having secur ed this they return to their native country and reside there without disclosing their change of llegi ance. They occupy official posi tions, or positions of trust or hon or, which can only be held by citi zens of their native land. They journey under passports describing them as eiicli citizens; and it is on ly when civil discord, after, perhaps years of quiet, threatens them, or their persons or their prosperity, or their native States draft them into its military service, that the fact of their change of allegiance is made known. They reside permanently away from the United States ; they contribute nothing to its revenues; they avoid the duties of citizenship, and they only make themselves known by a claim of protection. I have oireeted diplomatic and con sular officers of the United States to scrutinize carefully all such claims of protection. The citizen of the United States, whether native or adopted, who dis charges his duty to his country, is entitled to its complete protection. While I have a voice in the direc tion of affairs, I shall not consent to impair the sacred right by confer ring it upon fictitious and fraudu lent claimants. On the accession of the present Administration, it was found that the Minister for North Germany had made propositions for the ne gotiation of a convention for tho protection of emigrant passengers, to which no response had been giv en. It was concluded that, te be effectual, all the maritime Powers engaged in the trade should join in such a measure. Invitations have been extended to the Cabinets of London, Paris, Florence, Berlin, Brussels, The Hague, Copenhagen and Stockholm, to empower their representatives at Washington to simultaneously enter into negotia tions, and to conclude with the Uni ted States conventions, identical in tizens ofiform making nnitorm eioiii as to tne cousuuuuuu ui w,c pia of vessels to be devoted to the use of emigrant passengers, as to the quality and quantity of food, as to the medical treatment of the sick, and as to the rules to be observed during the voyage,, iu order to se cure ventilation, to promote health, to prevent intrusion, and to protect families ; and providing tor tne es tablishment of tribunals in the sev eral . countries for enforcing such regulations, by summary process. Your attention is respectfully called to the law regulating the tar-, iff on Russian hemp, and to the question whether to fix the charg es on Russian hemp higher than they are fixed on nianila is not a violation of our treaty with Rus siaplacing her products upon the same footing with those of the most favored nations. Our manufactures are increasing with wonderful rapidity under the encouragement which they now re ceive, with the improvements in machinery already affected and still increasing, causing niachineiy to take the place of skilled labor to a
