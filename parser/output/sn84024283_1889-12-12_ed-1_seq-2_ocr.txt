ELEVENTH CENSUS. Superintendent Porter' Kew Plan tor Dividing the State Into Census Dit triers Congressional District Lines Don't Go, and Supervisors Will be Chosen on Recommendation of Prominent Private Citizens. Washington, Dec. 6. Supervisors of the census are to be appointed in Jan uary. The country has been districted. For each district ono supervisor will be appointed. Each supervisor will have the selection of from 75 to S00 enumera tors to do the canvassing in his dis trict. The census districts do not con form to the Congressional districts. They have been arranged so as to ap portion the work as fairly as possible. Had the Congressional lines been al lowed the Congressmen would probably have had the naming of the supervisors. But in view of the departure from the Congressional boundaries, the Super intendent of the Census has adopted a different plan. It is pro- posed to appoint the supervisors on the recommendations of the leading citizens of the respective districts. Under this arrangement the candidate who is best indorsed by the leading citizens of his district will get the appointment. There is already great pressure for these su pervisorships. Congressmen find a con siderable proportion of their daily mail just now consists of letters from candi dates and their friends. They would be nnable to do much if they wanted to, because they can speak only for their districts, and these are not census dis tricts. Most of the Congressmen ap prove of Superintendent Porter's plan, and will leave the appointments to be made on the recommendations of citi zens. In view of the superintendent's con clusion to act upon the recommendation of the citizens of the districts, the bound aries of these districts will be of con siderable interest at this time.
