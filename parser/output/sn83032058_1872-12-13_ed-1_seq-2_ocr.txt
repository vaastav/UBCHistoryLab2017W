The Constitutional Convention ad journed to meet in Philadelphia on "7th of January next. Thus fitr many important and much needed changes have been propoeed. to the more im portant of which we will from time to time call attention. The presidential electors of the differ tent states, met at their respective cap itols, on last Wednesday, "th, in obe dience to the constitution, and cast their votes for President The state* carried by the radicals castiug their votes forGraut, and those carried by the democrats and liberals, mostly for Thomas A. Hendricks, Indiana's dis tinguished democrat, Horace Greeley, for whom they were chosen, having died, and, a coincidence worth men tioning, was buried on same day. This action of the democratic does tors, will be endorsed by the party as Mr. Hendricks is one of the moat popular and noble democratic states men in the country. It was advised by some that the democratic electors cast their vote for Graut, and thus make his election unanimous, which would induce him, as they alledged, to pursue a more just and moderate course against the southern states. We, for one, would have objected to that kind of disposi tion of the democratic electors, it would have been an insult and out rage upon every voter who voted against Grant in those states—it was principle that was involved and not the man, and such a course would have been a virtnal endorsement of all the bad done under Grant's admin istration, which no democratic voter intended to do. Besides if Gen. Grant can not do justice to those states with out being bribed in that nay, why let him stubbornly pursue his rule of ty ranny against the southern states. Those states ask no favors at the hands of Grant which they are not entitled to, under the common constitution. Let them receive justice —it is all they ask, and for it they will owe no thanks to him. Why should Grant receive the to tal electoral vote, when he only has come half million majority out of a vote of 7 millions, and of which 800,- 000 are negro votes, which, being de ducted leaves him in a minority on the white vote of nearly half a mill ion? The electors cboeen against Grant, were chosen for Greeley or some one representing the principles of the Bal timore platform, and these electors to cast their votes for Grant, would have violated a most sacred trust, while in voting for a democrat, the men who chose them hare proper experssion given to their ballot. The democratic electors did right in voting for a democrat, and had there been bat a single one, hia vote should not have been given to Grant, for the sake of making his election unanimous, and as a bribe to do hia doty toward a sister state. Unfitness of the Negro to Tote. Nothing can more conclusively es tablish the ignorance and utter unfit ness of the negro to exercise the right of suffrage, thanthe recent presidential campaign. There are some 800,000 negro voters in the United States, and all of these, with the exception of a paltry few, cast their votes for Gen. Grant. Not because these blacks al most solidly voted for Gen Grant, do we argue that tbey are ignorant and unfit to be voters, but because they had not intelligence enough to prevent their being led, misled, into voting thus, and were not able to judge for themselves. Now, when we take into consideration that Grant was not known before the war, and that Horace Greeley was known to every white man, woman and boy for the last thirty years, as a champion of the Degro race, and the moat powerful and ef fective one in the country, who was ardent and consistent as he was able in the cause of the blacks, we say, it is singular that the negro element scarcely gave their early friend a vote in recognition ef what Mr. Greeley had accomplished for them. This is singularjbut natural, and is easily ac counted for. The negroes of this country, as a man did not know Hoi* ace Greeley, they were ignorant of their greatest champion, and really were made believe by the white radi cals that he had be;n a slave driver, a rebel leader, and that if elected he would re-enslave them, and one negro woman was heard denouncing Greeley on the streets of Richmond, because he was the man, as she had been made believe, who sold her "baby into slav ery 1 Such stuff like thia waa told the blacks of the south, and being igno rant, they, believed it and voted against their earliest and best friend without knowing it. Where are there half dozen white men in this country, who could be made believe of Horace Greeley what waa told the negroes and which, in their utter ignorance they believed ? This accounts for the mass of the negro vole going for Gen. Grant. Had these poor blacks been possessed of the least intelligence, they should have known, what every white school boy knows, who Horace Gree ley was, andgtheir suffrages would not have been against him. We venture to say that the great body of the blacks • in. the South, to-day, does not know fven whom they voted for Presided and Vice President, and tbnt tl-Ci election Wing held again January Ist, they could be made believe that (Irani was the rebel leader and had sold negro babies, and that Jeff Davis was . i their saviour and champion who set' them free ami gave them the ballot, j Tho army officers, collectors, bu reau agents, and other Grant otlice hciders, in the south, who have th# blacks under their thumb are the chaps who made them believe such stuff aided by the eutire radical press of the country, which accused Mr. Greeley of these monstrosities, the most glaring and foul falsehoods of the the campnigu against and when they knew better, and were oon scions of the wrong and injustice they were * doing him in those basa and willfril falsehoods. Urn. Greeley's Will From an examination of Mr*. Gr<-- ley's will it appears the appointed Mr. Greeley executor and Ida Gieelcr ex ecutrix. She bequeaths to her hus band all her pictures and statuary, a rare and valuable collection, and in structs Ida Greeley to appropriate one hundred dollar* for tho purchase of some additional memento of her a flee tion for her husband, lu case ot Mr. Greeley's dying or marrying again Mrs. Greeley's real estate was not to be sold nor the principal of the prop erty used by either of tho children without the"joint consent of Ida Gree ley and Judge Hart. Mrs. Greeley had a policy of life insurance on Mr. Greeley's life to the amount of 

SIO,OOO to $20,000. It is also stated she had some lrioune shares and various oth er stocks besides the real estate The schemes proposed by President Grant in his message, aud which may be taken as indicative of h ; .a pro gramme for tho next term, are exceed ingly magnificent. He recommends the adoption of the postal telegraph system at an expen diture of from twelve to twenty mill ions and au increase of officeholders by some sixty or eighty thousand per sons; the building of a ship canal around Niagara J-'alls at the expense of fifteen to twenty millions more ; canals 'o connect the Mississippi Val ley with the Atlantic at a cost of fifty millions; "continuous land-locked navigation from Maine to tho Gulf of Mexico;" and the expenditure of twenty-five millions in mail subsidies during the next five years.' All these involve centralisation, corruption, lobby legislation, swindles and a general bedevilment of every body in Congress and out. Characteristic Letter of Mr. Greel ey in Relation to the Recent (. am pal^n Washiuglon, December 1. —As an introduction to the subjoined letter, it is proper to state that Mr. Greeley was a warm, personal friend of Charles lan man, to whern .it was addressed. Mr. Lanman's early essays as a writer were published in the New Yorker. Although he never participated in politics, Mr. Greeley occasionally lav ored him with letters of advice, and took a special interest in the success of his Dictionary of Congress. Greeley's last note to Lanman is as follows : NEW

The electors of states carded by the radicals, all voted for Grant. Iho Greeley electors mostly voted for lfendricks. The Creeley electors of Missouri voted as fellows : For President, B. GraU Brown, 8 ; Thomas A. Hendricks, 6; David Davis, 1; For Vice President, B. Grata Brown, C; Geo. W. Julien, 6 ; John M. Pairner, 3 ; Wm. S. Groeabeck, 1. The Greeley Electors of Arkansas as sembled last night, and, claiming to he elected, cast their rote of the State for B. GraU Brown for President and General N. P. Banks, of Massachusetts, for Vice President They did this, after being of ficially Informed by the Governor that on a canvass of the votes the Grant electors were elected. They charge that the latter result was reached through fraud. Tbey passed appropriate resolution* on the death of Mr Greeley. Roth sides in this State claim the election of ticket, and will endeavor to install themselves in to office. THE 

LIBERAL SENATORS OVER BOARD. I The doors of the radical shunty have been abut on Sumner, Schurz, Kenton, Trumbull, Ac., for their honesty and inde pendence during the late presidential cam paign. A correspondent of the World, writing from Washington under dale of 6tb inst, says, the democratic Senators this morning received a written notifica tion from the Republican caucu* commit tee to the effect that certain blanks hud been left in ttae revision of tuo Senate standing committees which the minority could fill nt their own pleasure. This raia ed at once the important question as to what the minority consisted of. The reg ular Republicans had chosen to utterly ig nore the Liberal*, even as a faction, and they were turned over to the tender mer cies efthe Democrats to be treated as their I pleasure might suggest. The first duty that devolved upon the Democrats was to address a note to the Liberal Republicans and to invite a consultation over the situ ation. Two of the Liberals rrspo.ided in such away as to show that they will here after act with the Democracy on all issues. Thete Senators are Tipton and Rice. To day they attended the regular Democratic caucus, held in Senator Thurmau's room, and they will probably hereafter continue j to consistently act with this party. At least Senator Rice thus avews his inten tion. The three most important vacancies secured on the Foreign Relations, Fi nance, and Judiciary committees, of which ! Senators Schurz, Fcnton, and Trumbull (Liberals; were respectively members. The old Democratic members of these com mittees were Casserly, Bayard, and Thur man. After a slight consultation it was agreed to retain these latter gentlemen in their present position with the single ex ception of the Foreign Relation. Here Senator Casserly, with a magnanimity un paralleled, declared that he would forego his own assignment in favor of Senator Schurz, whom he wished retained in bi I present place. The latter Senator, how ever, was extremely adverso to ucccpting this position under the circumstances, and especially in view of the personal sacrifice required; still as the designation was insis ted upon on all tides he reluctantly con sented to accept it. Senator Trumbull ! drops from his ten years' chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee to the tail end of the Retrenchment Committee. Governor Fenton is transterred from the Finance Committee to the last placemen Territories. Senator Sumner, by his declination in ad- positions, did not enter a* n element into the making up efjl a slate. ttico was taken from U.r Oiair-J maiidiip of the Committee en Mines trull Mining and Mannihal Hamlin substi tuted. Kenton was not only taken from thq Finance Committee, but also relieved ! of tho Chairmanship of the Committee on j Contingent Expenses, to which positioni Matthew- It. Csrponter was elevated ; j Senator l.ogau's removal comes in, he be-! I mg mudo leoond in the Military Commit*j tee. After Wilson's election to the Vice, j Presidency, l.ogan will be promoted to the Chairmanship. There were several committees to which two vacancies were allowed, but they are of such an unimpor tant character a not to affect legislation either in one way or another. To these position* the Democrats have made assign meat 10 cover their limited numbers Congraw Fhe Senate met at noon on Mon day, 2nd and in the opening prayer the chaplain alluded to the death of Mr. Greeley. Mr. Sunnier introduced j a bill to ha'nUh the names of battles ( in the civil war from aruiv registers j and regimental colors. Mr. Wilson introduced a bill for the relief of suf ferers by the Boston tire, and other minor resolutions were offered. A message being received from the House announcing the adoption ol thev concurrent resolution regarding the ( death of Horace Greeley, its immcdi-l nte consideration was agreed to. TheL President's annual message was then I■ brought in and read; after which Vice President presented the annual reports of the various departments, I j aud the Senate adjourned. L The House of Representatives was called to order at noon on Monday. After the usual opening formalities, Mr. Dawes moved a resolution cxpres sive of sympathy of the House for the, decease of ifuraee Greeley. Mr. Banks tendered his resignation as; Chairman of the Committee on FOP! eigu Affairs, which the House refused i to accept. Speaker Blaioo then vacat- 1 cd the Chair to speak on the charges of bribery in the case of the Credit Mobilier, and obtained the appoint-j incut of a select committee to investi-, gate the affair. After the readiug of the President's message, aud the re porting of sundry bills, the House ad journed. Mr. Sumner, in the Seuate, offered the following resolution. Whereas, National unity and good will among fellow citizens can be as sured only through oblivion of past differences, and it is contrary to the usuges of civilised nations to perpetu ate the memory of civil war; there fore, Be it enacted Ac., that the names of battles with fellow citizens shall not he continued in the army register, or placed on the Hegimeutal co.ors of the United States. HOt'SE. Speaker Blaine called Mr. Cox, of New York to the chair as Speaker pro tern, and took the floor to offer the following resolution: Whereas, Accusations have been made iu the public press, founded on the alleged letters of Oakes Ames, a representative from Massachusetts, and upon the affidavit of Heury S. Mc- Comb, a citizen of Wilmington, in the State of Delaware, to the effect that members of this House were bribed by Oakes Ames to perform certain leg islative acts for the benefit of the Un ion Pacific Kail rood Company by presents of stock in the Credit Mobil-; ler of America, or by presents of a valuable character derived therefrom; therefore, Resolved, That a special committee of five members be appointed by the .Speaker pro tempore, whose duty it shall be to investigate and ascertain whether any member of this House was bribed by Oaken Ames or any person or corporation in any matter touching his legislative duty; and that the committee bo authorized to seud for persons and papers. Mr. Blaine said be had requested Cox to appoint a majority of Demo crats ou the committee, aod made a few remarks challenging investiga tion. Mr. Arcbcr opposed the motion on ihe ground that the scandal had been refuted and the investigation was un necessary. Mr. Kaudall favored it as a matter of persona) privilege. Mr. Dawes said be hoped the reso lution would be adopted. Ihe resolution was adopted, with a few negative votes on the Democratic side, and Mr. Cox, as Speaker pro ten, ap pointed as tliej-elect committee Messrs Poland, Banks, 'Beck, Niblack and M'Crary. Mr. Dawes said : Mr. Speaker, be lieving that all will concur iu the propriety of a public recognition of the events so impressive and so with out parallel in the history of this Government that have recently trans pired, I deem it proper tooffer thefol: lowing resolution: Resolved, By the Senate and House of Representatives, that in view of the recent death of Horace Greeley, for whom, at the late election, mure than three millions of votes were cast for President, that a record be made on the journals of Congress of apprecia tion for the eminent services and per sonal purity and worth of the deceas ed, and of the sad impression created by his death, following a keen family bereavement. Mr. Cox, of New York, then paid# feeling tribute to the memory and character of Mr. Greeley, after which the resolution was unanimously adop ted. Mr. Banks again rose and offered bis' resignation as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, re marking that it was proper that the House should be represented by one who was unqualifiedly committed to the policy of the majority, as he could not claim to be. The House, by a vote of 59 to 76, refused to accept his resignation. The Concord (N. H.) Patriot has the following : In a letter to the Hon. Mason \V. TappaD, dated November 8, one of the very last Mr. Greeley wrote, be expresses great gratitude to Mr. Tap pan for going into the recent contest in his behalf with such zeal ; and says in his grave jocular manner : "I have been so bitterly assailed that I hardly know whether I was ! running for the Presidency or for the Penitentiary." Mr. Greeley thus speaks of the death of his wife : "In the darkest hour my long suf fering w-ife left ; not tob soon, as she I had suffered too deeply. I laid her in the grave with hard, dry eyes. Well, lam used up. I have slept little for weeks, and my eyes are hard to cloee, while they soon open again." Certain allusions made in the letter, as stated to us by Mr, Tappan, we are not at liberty at present to specify ; but bone that he will find it consist ent with propriety ultimately to pub lish the whole letter, the contents of which are specially interesting on ac count of their cauveying the lateat impressions of Mr. Greeley's mind on the situation of public affair*. i Simon (Mmcrou Adjourn* the SeutU I to Prevent *njr Kulogy of Greeley.

One thousand men were discharged from the yard on Wednesday, and fif ty on Tuiwdaj'. The notice of the dis charge was given to the men nt mus ter, the uamee of thoee discharged be ing given out at the time. The office of the K aval Constructor was thronged during the day by aniious inquirers, but the invariable answer was that it could not be helped, and groat dissat isfaction exists among the men. A reporter in the vicinity of the yard talked with several of the men, after their discharge, and the following 'is the conversation: Reporter—l uuderttanJ that OM thousand men were discharged mtcr day. Employee —Yea, sir ; 1 among the unlucky one*. Reporter —To what do you attribute tba discharge ? Employee—They aay tbey bare no funda with which to pay the men, and they are obliged to discharge them, but it it a lie. 1 have been in the yard tine* a month before election. 1 hare been taxed one day'a pay ia the yard vt3-50) to help re-elect Grant, and I hare to pay 1z.60 twice in my ward for the aanie purpose, and yet fifteen days after the election we are turned out in the cold without work,; and they tell ua they have no money to nay ua with. Reporter—la there any work to be done in the yard ? Employee—Well, the fact of the matter ia they make wrrk or not a* they please. The pcliticaaa hare their own way, and we are the suffer ers. A great many of us are in debt, and baring families to support, find lit hard to be put out of work. We do not blame them for trying to re-elect Grant, but we are down on them for employing us, and, after getting our vote*, turning us out by the wholesale. We hare not been paid yet, and we will have to wait till next pay day to get the few dollars due us. The poli ticians hare kept away from the yard the last few daw, and do not care whether we are discharged or not. Reporter —What doea Mr. Delano say? Employee—He eays he cannot help us, but that he thinks it very hard to have to put ua out of wgrk. There are now about one thouaand five hundred men in the yard, and it ia reported that two hundred more will be discharged this week—Sun.

AMIMBLY. PARIS, November 18,— Seldom if ever has there been so large a crowd assembled as there was to-day at the time of the Ver sailles Assembly. The anterooms and passages, and even the high road in front of the palace, were blocked up by the throng. Every inch of standing room was taken up, in spite of the special Gardes told off to maintain order in expectation'of tho throng. An hour before the proceed ings commenced the Assembly was Ailly occupied. In the President's box were Mine. Thiers, Mile. Boasis, and many of the diplomatic body. Pull as were the galleries during the last sittings ef the As sembly, they were taller to-day than ever, and the army was unusually largely rep resented by MacMahon, Oissey, and Paid herbs.
