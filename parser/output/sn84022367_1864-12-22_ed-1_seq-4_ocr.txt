' ! ( To one, can be at a loss to understand s the military stems in Tennesseo at pres ent. In the first place Tennessee as well as Kentucky belongs to the .Union, and cirn never be wrested from it.- This tcie to be a hard lesson for the Ten Bcssee aud Kentucky rebels, but it is an . .-, iinatorable truth. Our government -. keejwwhat it gets, and the principal thing that the rebels accomplish by in vading Union territory is to bring addi tional dLsfcess upon rebel sympathizers. . , . In considering the subject of the ,rebel- lion, therefore, we may Imitate the ex 's ample of preachers who, In unfolding a ' given subject, sometimes commence by ' .' BtaiSng what their subject does not im- . ply. The rebellion does not include the BtaVtf alxve mentioned ; and for all i practical purposes we may alw throw y mt o( the accouut Arkansas, Texas, '. Louisiafca, Mississippi, Alabama, .and 3 Georgia.' We take it for granted that I : Hood is a -used up general, ' having lost in the engagements of Thursday and Fri day last not less than 45 pieces of artil lery, 5000 prisoners and as many more pstot of a condition to fight.

It would be useless and unprofi table to indulge in speculations as to .5 the expenditure of time, treasure and life noeessary to destroy this army. No tloubt all other operations have more or less direct reference to this " consumma-. lion devoutly to be wished." and that - Its realization is not very far distant. a The rebels still indulge a lingering : tope that this nation will become bank ruptthat they shall succeed In foment- ! lng! a war with Canada and as a last - resort that they shall conciliate the good will of European nations by emancipate t lug their slaves. , Eut the downward tendency of gold" for the last few days does pot indicate any very Immediate j rrospect, 6f bankruptcy 5 ; the course r. , parsued by the Colonial authorities in dicates both a disposition and an ability l. rectify the ; wrongs committed by Conrsoland Lamothe-, and In reference to the proposed emancipation of the Haves, every philanthropisf will ' Bay, , "God speed the day!"

What visions or good things float before . their imagination, and St. Nicholas is strangely blended In with their dreams. Whip, skates and sled for Master Charley. Dolls, dishes and the usual accompaniments for house keeping In the LllipuUan style for Miss Carrie of seven, who has turned her at-; tentlon lately to housekeeping, such as wiping grandmother's dishes and help ing a little, as all young girls can If they try. Dear little innocent children ! enjoy bright anticipations while you may. For to older people there Is more In an ticipation than In realization. . And to little folks Christmas gifts generally prove short lived. Skates and top will get out'bf order, dolly will get her face ncratched and nose bumped, and when her beauty la gone then she gets to be an old story, a sad case of desertion and neglect. Christmas is coming to our noble soldiers too. No warm nook by the chimney to hang their gray socks that TJncle Sam provides for his boyB. A happy Christmas to all, as noble sol dier boys, say I. And Christmas is coming to his lovcd-ones at home too. The little ones will nestle In their beds and when snugly tucked up by mother's ever ready hand they will breathe their prayer for father's safe return. Glide smoothly Into dreamland. Ah! little ones! God hears infant whispers as well as manhood prayers. How many Chrlst masea will come and go before this awful war shall cease, and a father and brother come home to us victorious. Onr Father which art in heaven only knows. God ' grant, before another Christmas comes the glad voice of peace may be heard throughout our land. MinzA. Congressional. The resolutions in troduced by Mr. Davis of Maryland ani. passed by tne House on Monday, were designed to hit Mr. Seward. They dis approve of his apology to France for the Mexican resolution of last session, and assert that "the propriety, of any decla ration of any foreign policy by Congress is enftlciently proved by the vote which pronounces it ; and such a proposition, while pending and undetermined, Is not a fit topic of explanation with any for eign power." It is to be presumed that Mr. Davis feels" better. , . - Cosorbss. In the Senate on Montey Mr. Doolittle introduced a resolution au thorizing the President to expend ten millions of dollars, or so much thereof aais necessary, to build fortifications and floating batteries for the protection of the lakes and frontiers against at tacks of piratical and hostile expedi tions organized in the British provinces by enemies of the United States. He wished 'the resolution referred to the Committee on Naval Afiairs. Mr. Sum ner suggested that it be referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Where upon an interesting debate ensued in re- gard to the recent discharge of the 6t. Albans robbers at Montreal and the hos tility generally displayed by the British and Canadians to the United States. -The di'scussion revealed the fact that Mr. Sumner, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to which the sub ject was tonally referred,- is decidedly conservative in Ms views of the existing difficulty with Canada. Mr. Henderson introduced a resolution providing for the protection of the Missouri frontier by the completion of the southwest branch of the Pacific Railroad to Spring field. A bill to create the rank of vice admiral in the navy was introduced and referred to Jhe Naval Committee. The House bill ta naturalize aliens servinff in the army and navy was read a first time and then laid aside. The bill re moving the disqualification for carrying the mails on account of color was passed. The Senate adopted the House joint resolution to adjourn on Thursday next to January, and after disposing of some unimportant subjects, and hold ing an executive session, adjourned. In the House of Representatives, Mr. Davis of Maryland Introduced the reso lution which was on Thursday last re ported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and laid on the table to the effect that Congress has a constitutional right to an authoritative voice in de claring aud proclaiming the foreign pol icy of the country. This declaration was endorsed by one hundred and eight een votes against eight. And another declaration, that any proposition effect ing our foreign policy, undetermined by Congress, is not a fit topic of diplomatic explanation with any foreign Powers. was agreed to by a vote of sixty-eight against fifty-eight. ' The Committee of Ways and Means reported a bill altering the time on which the whisky tax goes into effect from the 1st of February to the 1st of January, and Imposing an ad ditional tax of fifty cents per gallon on domestic spirits on hand. The House agreed as to the alteration of the date, bat rejected the proposed additional tax by a vote of sixty-five against sixty. Mr- Spanlding, of Ohio, made a speech sustaining the President's Message, and the House adjourned. X . A0Tmm Stamfidi Axono th Gold Gammier. The New York Herald of yesterday says : : -v . ' On Saturday last gold sold as high as 2.S7. On Mouday it rau down to a descent of twenty-five r ceut under the chilling winds of the South that have brought the good tidings of the ro cent great victories of the Union arms. We believe that to the end of the war the gold bulls will not again carry their heads to high as they did eveii last Sat urday morning. We believe that a break bos at leugth ueeu made among them which will carry down gold and the prices of everything except "green backs," right on now to the capture of Richmond. Let the people do all they can to make the victory of the national armies, navy and cuneney complete and decisive, and let Mr. Secretary Fesscn den do his best to sustain the cause of the Treasury and the people, and we will soon be out of the woods. Froen Potator. Those who are so unfortunate as to have potatoes frozen, may find comfort In the following from the Germantown Telegraph : If your potatoes lreeze in the cellar, don't wait for them to thaw, but throw them into a conical heap, either where they are, or in the open air, and cover with dirt, straw, shavings, old clothes, or chaff, packed tight with them and they are safe. The cover will prevent sudden changes, which causes all the mischief. I have saved frozen potatoes in this way : it may be new to some of your readers, and may be of use to them, as it has been to ine. Slavery in Kbmtdcmv. It Is a fact which cannot be controverted that slave ry is a "dead cock in the pit" in this State. There can be no disagreement as to why this Is so. The traitors who un dertook to destroy the government, and precipitated the civil war upon us Jeff. Davis, Yaucey, Rhett and company are the greatest abolitionists of the day. Upon them and their supporters and sympathizers is the responsibility of destroying slavery. Ail must agree to the fact. Theouestion with Kentucky should now be, how can the State get rid of the burden of the dead institution in the safest and best manner, aud with the least delay ? If we wait for the amend ment of the State Constitution it will take until 1870. But by amending the Constitution of the United States tin supreme law of the kind the end can be reached much sooner. The next Legis lature can require the members of Con gress to vote for that amendment, aud their votes will carry it through Con gress, and the question will then be sub mitted to the States for their approval or rejection. And if approved, by the 4th of July, 1806, slavery or involuntary servitude, except for crime, will not be known in the United States. If the Legislature of Kentucky will do this, we think it probable Congress will remunerate all loyal slaveholders in this State. Frankfort (Ky.J Common-wealth. Smoke for the Curb op Wovvns. A correspondentof the Country Gentleman recommends smoke as a cure for wounds in men and animals. He says : " I cut my foot with an axe. The lady of the house, seizing the foot while it was yet bleeding freely, held it over a pan con taining smoking tag locks. In a few minute the bleeding stopped, the smoke was removed and a bandage applied to protect it from accidental blows. The wound never suppurated and consequent-' ly never pained me. I have seen the remedy tried in several similar cases, and always with the same results,. Let the reader remember that no linimjnt or salve, drawing or healing, should be ap plied. You have merely to smoke the wound well, and nature will do the rest. I suppose that the smoke of burning wood would produce the same result. but it would not be so manageable. There Is a principle in the smoke of wool wnicn,,wnen applied to tne nesn, coagu lates the albumen, thus rendering it un susceptible, of putrefaction, The same principle stops bleeding by coagulating the blood. It promotes healing, and may be applied with decided benefit to all nlcers, wounds and cutaneous dis eases.", Optspoxin. Tho Fenians In Jersey City, at a meeUuir held on Friday night, resolved, in connection with the Inter ference of Rev. E, Venuta, the Catholic priest, with a previous assemblage of theirs, that they repudiated all ecclesi astical interference with their political actions as American citizens, whether they might relate to lrinh or American affafni, and that they acknowledged no arbiter except the constitution and the laws. They also resolved that the eou duct of the reverend gentleman above named was an unwarrantable usurpa tion of despotic power, , Intolerable In a democratic republic, and, If submitted to, calculated to nudermlue and eventu ally destroy their dearest privileges as freemen, and protested against the as sumed authority on the part of the Rev, . Venuta, or any other churchman, de claring that they would boldly .and steadfastly resist the same. Soldiers to thb Front. The Secre tary of War has published an order which commends Itself to the judgment of every patriotic citizen, whether sol dier orclvillan." Mr. Stanton announces that every officer and soldier Is now vanud at the front, and those who are n& to-day on duty are ordered Immediately to join their respective organizations. Those who neglect to conform with this mandate will find themselves unless they are confined at home by Illness in the condition of deserters. We should hope that the order will be promptly and cheerfully obeyed by every soldier, whether officer or private, who deserves to wear the Union uniform. The hour of final and glorious success for the na tional cause hastens with rapid paee. Soldiers, to the front ! The MoniPicATios op Gen. Dix's Or der. The-Washlngton correspondent of the New York Herald says that the dis approval by the President of Gen. Dlx's order relative to future raids from Can ada excited some surprise there, as the order met with almost universal appro bation. It is understood, however, that it was induced by official assurances from the Canadian authorities that ev ery possible effort should be made to bring tho raiders to justice, and that such measures should be taken as would prevent any similar demonstration in future, and promises to keep rebel refu gees under strict surveillance hereafter.

In onr special Washington dispatches this morning may be found the pith of a singular article from the Richmond En quirer on the subject of arming and emancipating the slaves. There, is in ternal evidence in the article that the writer has been more or less officially inspired. The argument is, that when the South has already come down so far from its independent stand point as to supplicate foreign uations for help, it must lie prepared to receive such help on the conditions on which alone it will be given, viz: the abolition of slavery. If the Confederacy, moreover, agree to abolish slavery, the writer contend- it will not be necessary to go to European nations for protection ; they will at once accord recognition to the South, and fol low it up, if necessary, with forcible In tervention. Minor arguments, based on the special military exigencies of the crisis, are advanced to show that arm ing and emancipating the slaves are not only measures of possible exoediency, but that they are measures absolutely necessary to the continued existence of the Southern conspiracy. 1 Gen. Lee's opinion-Ms cited by the Enquirer to sus tain the policy it urges. And we have no doubt that the editor, by this time, might draw a considerable number of additional arguments ou the same side, front the progress of affairs around Nashville, Wilmington and Savannah. 2V.
