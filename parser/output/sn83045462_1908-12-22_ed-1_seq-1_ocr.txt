PLOT TOJCjU GOME Castro Accused of Complicity in Attempted Murder. MAINE ON PEACE MISSION! Gomez Government Probably Beady to Make Terms. STILL DANGER OF CIVIL WAR In That Event American Battleships Will Be on Hand to Protect Our Interests. CARACAS. Venezuela, Monday, Pe opmbcr 21, via Willemstad, Curaco, December 22.?The downfal of President Castro in Venezuela was completed .Saturday last with the frustration of a desperate plot to assassinate Juan Vicente Gomez, the acting president of the republic. Secret cipher cablegrams "have passed between President Castro, in Berlin, and his agents here since the popular antiCastro demonstration of December <13 and 14. ?i A prominent lawyer has filed an accusation in the high federal court charging President Castro with complicity in the attempted assassination, and proposing his impeachment. 

CARACAS, Venezuela, Friday, December IS. via Ponce, Porto Rico, December 22.?There has been no repetition in this city of the anti-Castro demonstrations of December 13 and 14, but the enforced resignation of the Castro cabinet, which occurred yesterday. is regarded as going far toward sealing the fate of President Castro in Venezuela. The fall of the cabinet is a logical outcome of the fact that Acting PfiiciHonf : a a _ at? * ?v??uvhv uviu^a |/ci uiiiieu ino amiCastro demonstrations in Caracas the early part of this week. The change of ministry was effected and made known only after the arrival in the capital of 1,500 soldiers from the interior who are loyal to Gomez. There la much military activity everywhere, and troops are being recruited and armed with energy, in the belief that; the men In the Interior loyal to Castro will fight. The Impression prevails in diplomatic circles that the action of the United States ta sending warships to Venezuela in the pending crisis is the initiation of movements looking to the re-establtah? meat- tit friendly relations between the two governments. This impression is predicated on recent developments in the South American republic indicating the possible overthrow of the Castro administration^ It is freely predicted that a rapprochement will be accomplished through either the reformed government headed by Vice President Gomez, from the cabinet of which the CaStro element Is admittedly absent, or through an entirely new administration. The absence of-diplomatic representation on the part of the United States in Venesuela has kept it from being fully in-1 formed of recent political developments in o t rtiinrtoi* On/1 11 hoa 1??*/1 " JJ-

Vice President Gomez's reported disapproval of the forern policy cf the Castro administration, especially as regards the United States and Venezuela, is an important factor in the settlement of existing troubles. Week to Make Journey. It will take the battleship Maine a week to reach Venezuela. It is not denied that that is her destination, nor is it admitted. Studied reticence obtains as to her mission as well as to the movements of the gunImats Dolphin and the cruiser Drs Moines now in Haitain waters, and which a dispatch from Port au Prince says are going to Curacao. The movements of these vessels are not posted at the Navy Department today, and all applications f< r information as to their destination are referred to the State Department. With these vessels in or near the Venezuelan coast the United States will be fully prepared for any eventuality, and ran easily establish prompt communication with Venezuelan ports, and also with the State Department. All Information in possession of the government regarding the situation in Venezuela is being withheld from the public as necessary for the pubic interests. PUT TO SEA IN

NORFOLK, Va., December 22.?The cruiser North Carolina put to sea today in a northeast storm with the wind blowing thirty-six miles an hour at Cape Henry. The battleship Maine passed down the coast today in the storm and with a wind velocity off the Hatteras coast of twenty-six miles an hour and high seas prevailing. Admiral Arnold is sailing southward with partially sealed orders. It was announced here today that the cruisers Montana and North Carolina are now under the direct orders of Admiral Arnold. Nothing official concerning the movements of the Maim. Montana and North Carolina will be divulged here. All that will be .ca!d Is that the vessels have reported their departure to sea. The Norfolk navyyards says it has no official knowledge of the naval board of inspection and survey being held aboard the Montana today for her standardization test. SURPRISE TO CASTRO. Disturbed by News From Venezuela. Ill From High Living. BEItl.IN. December 22.?The news of the appointment of a new Venezuelan cabinet contained in a dispatch from Port of Spain. Trinidad, came as a complete surprise to the Venezuelan president, Cipriano Castro,. and his associates in tterlin. and was received with more ?r less apprehension. The Venezuelans have had no conllrmation of this intelligence and for this reason they are inclined to discredit It. as they have other Venezuelan news that was known to ie authentic. l>r. Israel decided today that no operaiion on President Castro is necessary. He finds that he is not suffering from any eerlous complaint, but from the effects of hLb living. 4 NO 

IMPLIED POWERS District Commissioners Creatures of Statute. ' . COURT OF APPEALS RULES Appellate Tribunal Reverses Judgmanf in T nnrl Pasa JUVU b 1U JUOliU VOOC< PROCEDURE MUST BE CHANGED Commissioner of Patents Upheld. Oen. Harries Not Liable in Damages for Cleveland Drowning. That the District Commissioners are creatures of statute, possess no implied powers, and must gather their authority to act from the express terms of the law granting it is the dictum of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, expressed today in an opinion by Mr. Justice Van Orsdel. When the Commission is attempt to act under a statute granting J authority, the justice declares, they must comply literally with its requirements. The opinion reverses the judgment ot the District Supreme Court, which confirmed, over objections of John C. Fay, a property holder, a verdict of a jury condemning certain land for an alley In the square bounded by Fairmont and Giraril, I loin ana i?n streets. Mr. Fay attacked the allegations of the petition for the condemnation of the land. I which set out that the commissioners | deemed it to the public Interest that the alley in question should be opened, and that a request for the alley had come from more than one-half of the owners in the square. Justice Barnard overruled the objections of Mr. Fay and allowed the jury to he sworn and later confirmed the award of the jury. Mr. Justice Van Orsdel holds the action of the lower court to have been a reversible error, for, says the court, "the mere signing of the petition by the commissioners does not purport such united consideration and conference together upon the subject as is necessary to authorize an official declaration that the public interests demand the taking of private property for public use. Statutes like the present, authorizing the taking of private property for public use, are to be strictly construed." "Neither has the court," the opinion continues, "any implied Jurisdiction in the premises. Every requirement of a statute conferring jurisdiction upon the court to entertain a proceeding, providing a legal method of taking private property, must be complied with to the letter. It must clearly appear, either by express admission of the parties or by competent evidence, . that all the jurisdictional requirements are present before the court can lawfully proceed." As to the claim q/ the owner that no majority of owneVs had asked for the alley, the court said that it is clear that this allegation could be based only upon the actual possession of such a petition by the Commissioners. "When the truth of the allegation of the existence of such a document was challenged by proper objection," Mr. Justice Van Orsdel declares, "the court could not in the absence of proof other than the allegation In the petition assume that such an instrument had actually been filed." The petition in this case is similar to all those heretofore filed by the Commissioners in like proceedings, and the action of the appellate court will, it is said, make it necessary to hold a board meeting and to have a written petition signed by a majority of the property holders whenever tlie opening, widening or extending of an alley within the District is desired. Sustains Commissioner of Patents. The Court of Appeals today sustained the appeal of Edward B. Moore, commissioner of patents, froip the writ of mandamus granted last July by Justice Wright of the District Supreme Court, at the instance of William H. Bayer of New York. The commissioner had declined to permit Moyer to have access to cerA . i 11 A< -? A > ? - Iain application papers perilling me UCterminaMon of the question of title on appeal. The lower court directed a mandamus to issue, holding that th$ department must accept the rulings ?>f the court when no supersedeas bond has been given on an appeal from that decision. The appellate court In an opinion by Mr. Justice Van Orsdel characterizes the action of the lower court :u? an "instance of judicial interference with the discretionary power of an executive officer of thee government." The commissioner of patents, says the court, is vested with authority to control and regulate the course of proceedings In his office. If. in his Judgment, action on a pending application should he suspended temporarily for what he deems a sufficient reason, so long as such suspension does not interfere witN a positive legal right, a court* will not inquire into the wisdom of ids action. No right of Boyer having been invaded, the court held, and ail his rights being fully protected, no ease was presented for interference by the courts. The order directing the mandamus was reversed and the cause remanded, with direction to dismiss the petition. Reversal in Ejectment Case. Another reversal of the action of the lower court was made by Mr. Justice Van Orsdel in the case of Isaac B. Bursev against Isaac S. Lyon. This was an ejectment proceeding for the possession of real estate. The decision of the commissioner of patents was affirmed in six appeals and reversed in four others. Gen. Harries Not Liable. Gen. George II. Harries, commanding the District of Columbia militia, was exonerated by the Court of Appeals today of i all responsibility for the death of Melvin L Cleveland, who was drowned frcm a launch attached to the C.S S. Oneida, n;ar Blackistone Island, during a cruise of the Naval Battalion, N. fl. D. C., hi Noveniber. 190G. Mr. Justice Van Orsdel delivered tlie opinion of the court, affirming the action or Justice Wright In holding that Gen. : Harries was not answerable in damugc.c for the death of the boy. "We think the selection of Bleo and Durston, the two otficars alleged to have been directly in charge of the beat and ! responsible for the presence of the boy In the launch, to command the vessel on this cruise, under the allegations of the declaration. Is not sufficient to attach any liability to Gen. Harries. The appointment of these officers to the command is the last point at which the declaration connects Gen. Harries, either directly or , Indirectly, with the accident. It fails to charge him with having given any directions whatever as to the manner in which the vessel shoud be run, or how the launch should be towed. He was not present when any of the events occurred which led up to the accident. The acts charged upon which it is sought to attach liability are too rrmol > anddtsenn! nected from the acts directly aliened as I causing the accident to constitute the | proximate eau'-e."

SNOW STORM FROM SOUTH | GEORGIA RESPONSIBLE FOR TODAY'S DOWNFALL. I Won't Last Long, the Weather Bureau Man Says?Yesterday Beginning of Real Winter. Georgia, the land of eotton and sunshine. is responsible for the heavy snow Btorni which descended upon Washington today, according to Prof. Harry Frankenfi? id. forecaster of the weatlier bureau. The telegraphic records of Prof. Willis J.. Moore's department show that down in Georgia rain was falling tills morning, when a northeast wind bobbed up from some meteorological quarter and developed the storm, sending it scudding to Virginia and tiie District of Columbia, accompanied by a profuse fall of "the beautiful." The plains, forests and cities of Virginia were first whitened by the fall before it struck Washington about 11 o'clock this forenoon. When asked how long the Georgia disturbance will continue in this vicinity Prof. Frankenfleld said it ought not to last more than twenty-four hours from the time the snow began. He also said the present snow will not lay long enough to give the District "a white Christmas." The temperature tomorrow will hover about tne freezing" point, but when* the clouds uncover the sun the snow will turn into slusn and mud.' Yesterday was the "shortest day" in the year and marks the beginning of real winter. The sun did not rise yesterday and today until about 1.1 minutes past 7. The sun will set today, as it did yesterday. at about ill minutes past 1 o'clock, giving just nine and one-half hours of daylight. TvpicaJ snow pictures were presented in the streets and suburbs ot Washington today. The snow was of the clinging variety and played havoc with some of the telephone wires, -giving the "hello girls" a peck of trouble and making many subscribers use language that finds no place in Sunday school literature. Traffic on the concreted roadways was more or less interfered with by the covering of snow, and numerous horses that were not rough shod went down. Pedestrianisun was not the most cheerful work today, especially to those people who bad neglected to wear their gum shoes. Word comes from the surrounding suburban places that the snow is forming a rather deep coverlet and that it may lay in the high places until Christmas is ushered in Friday morning. No reports were received this afternoon of serious delay in railroad or electric railway traffic on account of the Georgia snowstorm'. Four Inches at Richmond. 

RICHMOND, Va.. December 22.?At noon today there was four inches of snow on the ground here and a heavy wet snow was still falling. TROUBLE AT HAVILOCX, NEB.

The handcuffing of the accused and the j addition of the soldiers to the number of guards were due to the receipt of infornia- ! tion by the authorities that two of the i prisoners had been overheard making plans to escape by breaking away from the deputy sheriffs going to or returning from the courthouse. The names of the two prisoners have not been made public. John Shaw, aged fifty years, and engaged in the general merchandise business in Samburg, on Reelfoot lake, was the first witness called today.
