They ai-e shbrterby 75 per cent, and he says something in every line. He confine; himself to the great issues before the nation and leaves details where they belong, with cabinet and department officers. '.The last message had more great issues to meet than any other, and the president has concisely but com prehensively dealt with them. What was of the most interest was military and naval preparedness, a question which has been brought most emphat ically to the front by the European war. ; f Mr. Wilson says, in the first place, that we are not unprepared. He did not go into detail in this. He simply said it, and went on. This was the best thing he could do. He should know and does know unless depart ment officials have grossly deceived him. To tell how we are prepared is information that shouldn't be . given out. Mr. Wilson shows plainly that no great increase will be made in the army during his administration.; He does not want the country to build warships that may be obsolete be fore they leave the shipyards. On both these subjects, the president shows sound sense, and we believe meets the views of the country. It is plain by what Mr. Wilson says that he desires our citizensto organ ize and train in large number for na tional defense. He wants the gov 'ernment to furnish them with arms and instruction -equipment and in struction. This is a proper desire and one thb Star would like to see ful " filled. It hopes that Congress will take the necessary steps to see if the "plan can be carried out. Personally the Star doubts that the people will go into any such movement until they are driven into it. They will put it off. until some great power makes an offensive move; then they will make a wholesale rush that , will swamp the government and cause them to be butchered by thousands if war fol lows. . .Mr. Wilson's desire to impress the "woHd by our peacefulness is higk ana noble almost too high for hu man nature, we fear. The history of the world shows that good people and good nations are always imposed on. We can stand beings imposed on to a considerable extent, and will find it pays us better than to impose on other people to any extent. But we can't stand being run over as we 

COAST LINE HAS IMPROVED ITS COACHES THE CITY ELECTION ever, that they all believe in the resurrection ; meantime, the ghost ? is . Dr. Chace and Mr. ' Ferguson say The result j that "Full many a flower is born to blush unseen" is poetic fiction. -1 . John Taylor says that people who think he can't cut anything but ice labor under a sad misapprehension.. POWER COMPANY'S The Star is glad to be able to note an improvement in the passenger coaches used on trains No. 39 and 40 on the Jacksonville and St. Peters burg run. While these trains haven't been given new cars, those in use have been put thru the shops and are now in better condition than they have been for a number of years. When the trains start out on their runs, in the morning the coaches are in pretfy fair shape. ' - - Trains 39 and 40 do a heavy local business. , For several years they have had very shabby coaches. The present cars are not palatial, but they are a great improvement. It has seemed to the Star that the Coast Line, under Superintendent Brand, is making greater efforts to please its local patrons than it did before that gentleman came on deck. As for the division superintendent, Mr. McArthur, he always does the best he can with the resources at his disposal. The Star is always better pleased to observe improvement than! to kick at neglect. Our annual local political spasm is , liable to walk at any time. over and everybody, including the de feated candidates, is pleased at least, they say they are. is as follows: For mayor, Mr. J. D. Robertson re ceived 345 votes -85 in the first ward, 146 in the second, 32 in the third and 82 in the fourth. A number of com plimentary votes were cast for Dr. J. E. Chace. In the first ward, Mr. D. W. Tomp kins received 77 votes to Mr. E. C. Bennett's 26. .', " In the second ward, Mr. J. M. Mef fert for the short term received 203 votes. For the long term, Mr. J, J.i Gerig received 157 votes and Mr.' C! W. Hunter 63. In the third ward, Mr. H. A. Fausett received 27 votes and Mr. J. G. Ferguson 10. Mr. Ferguson wasn't a candidate, some of his friends writ ing his name on their tickets by way of compliment. In the fourth ward, Mr. G. Aj Nash had a walkover for the short term, receiving 52 votes. For the long term, Mr. F. G. B. Weihe received 40 votes. Mr. Jno. T; Moore also re ceived 40, but his name being written on the tickets 29 votes were cast for J. T. Moore and ,11 for J. . Moore, so it will take the official count to decide' which of them is elected. Mr. W. A. Robertson received 9 votes. Mr. Moore and his friends think they did very well, considering the short notice of his; candidacy. Some votes, they say, on account of improper marking, were' thrown out; so they are confident of winning, if another contest is held for hat ward. On the other hand, it is said that some of the votes for Mr. Moore were cast for the' short term, which would cause him to lose. The matter can't be decided till the council meets next Tuesday night. ; 

PROPOSITION And Other Important Affairs Will be Discussed at the Board of Trade Meeting this Evening At the meeting of the . Marion County Board of Trade this evening at Boanl of Trade headquarters, ; the proposition of the Florida Power Company will be presented for discus sion.' .'. . , --V'l -v:; ;. v 4 The power company's proposition appears elsewhere in today's pAPr, and is made to the city for the pur pose of furnishing power for operate ing the electric lighting of the city for a term of years. Mr. R. C. Camp will be on hand to explain in detail the plan proposed by his company, and - every member should be. present to hear just what is in the proposition. . . , . It is probable that there will.be further developments to report on the very important matter of Mr. Car michael's proposition for a freight boat line on the Okfcnvaha, and the meeting will be full of interest for all who attend.' , '

It takes particular exception to . the following paragraph: ' "We note some criticisms are, that the commissioners have allowed a re duction in train service, without giv ing the public an opportunity to be heard. All we have to say, with ref erence to ; that,-is-that iflall the peo ple had been heard, it would not have resulted in changing' a single figure before us or brought the carriers a cent more revenue.' The fact that a community may petition in protest to the commissioners, . does not in any way affect the revenue which the rail road is actually getting from busi ness. In. answer to other criticisms, that the commissioners have acted without due regard to the public, we regret to say, that there seems to be a misconception on the part' of some, of what is intended by regulative law, regulating public service corpora tions, .and instead of the commission ers acting with discretion, that they must do whatever the public says must be don6.

Germany had quarreled with America as she did with Russia. While it has seemed for some years that there is greater danger of America " having trouble with Germany than with any other power, except Japan, the Star does not think that any of them are so good that they wouldn't take ad vantage of us if they could and thought it was to their interest. 

HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD Some of the Star's friends have tried to rebuke it for what they con sider its change in policy in regard to the proposition of the Florida Pow er Company to furnish the city with current. - The Star hasn't changed its . policy in the least. It has always been the Star's policy that everybody had a right to be heard on a public proposi tion. The Florida Power Company has made an open and aboveboard and very fair business proposition. It has a right to make the proposition, and the people of yOcala have a right to an opportunity to consider it. The Star stands right where it al ways has stood on municipal owner ship, and doesn't think it is going to make any change. It has, however, always desired to impress on the peo ple that they can't make a success out of public ownership unless they give it close and interested attention. They must study every matter connected with it and decide ' what they want . done, and then see that it is done. There is no more reason to refuse to consider the Camps' proposition than there would be to refuse to con sider a proposition from the Wood mar Sand and Stoivi Company to pave Oklawaha avenue. tecting , the people against the rail ways, as well as for a protection to the railways against any unreasona ble demands, and it will be the pur pose of this commission, so long as we remain in office, to discharge every public duty in this manner. Justice, as near as we can arrive at it, is our purpose." Commenting on this, the Times says: ' "It seems to us that there are al ways two sides to a question. The people have the right to be heard where their interests are at. stake. Suppose several of these communities had been able to show to the railroad commission that the business given the railroad on these self-same trains that the commissioners allowed to be cut off was sufficient to pay the ex pense of their operation ? While we do not say that subh is the case in the present instance, railways have been known to state their own case in their own way without sticking to the straight line of truth, and they are not alone in that habit. And the Times wishes to call the attention of the honorable members of the Florida railroad commission to just-one more fact that they seem to have overlook ed, namely, that the board is the ser vant of the people of Florida, or should be, and it has no right to hear only one side of a case where the peo ple's interests are at stake." The Star has no doubt that the commission has acted right in this in stance, and thinks it was an occasion to act without delay. However, the commission was very unlucky in the utterance alluded to. It goes far to support the prevailing opinion that a corporation receives on simple de mand the justice the people can hard ly obtain by any means. wrinkled with thought to ' the top of - Monday's Lakeland Telegram pub- his head, intently studying "Johnson Hshed a picture of the large ,Meth- on the Science of Municipal Govern- odist "church there, and in speaking ment."
