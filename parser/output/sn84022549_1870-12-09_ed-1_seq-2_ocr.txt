BELLOWS FALLS, DEC. 9, 1870 The public dolt was agaiu reduced over seven millions last mouth. Congress met last Monday, there be'ng a good attendance iu both houses. The Presidents Message is received very fa vorably, aud is well calculated to pro duce a good effect, aud carry forward his administration to still further success. The Presidents Message. We have neither time nor space for the excellent message of the Presideut this week, hut the President himself closes with a fine summary of it which we copy as fol lows : " In conclusion, I would sum up the policy of the Administration to bo a thorough enforcement of every law ; a faithful collection of the taxes provided for; economy iu the disbursement of the same; a prompt payment of every debt of the nation ; a reduction of taxes as rapidly as the requirements of the coun try will permit; reductions of taxation aud tariff to be so arranged as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest num bers; honest and fair dealings with all other people, to the end that war, with all its blighting consequences, may be avoided, but without surrendering any right or obligation due lo us ; a reform io the treatment of Iodians, and in the whole civil service of the country ; and finally, in securing a pure untrammeled ballot, where every man entitled to cast a vote may do so just once at each elec tion, without fear of molestation or pro scription on account of his political faith, nativity, or color. U. S. Graxt. Executive Monition, Dec. 5, 1870. Capital Punisumext A Query. The discussion and action iu our late Legislature upon the subject of Capital Punishment cannot have failed to inter est thinking minds. I want a little in formation. The bill passed by the House abolishing the Death Penalty, if I un derstand it, made imprisonment at haid labor for life "the penalty" for murder, no matter how aggravating the case might be. Now if this were the law of the land, should not we find it utterly impossible, iu certain cases to punish the murderer at all ? It has been no un common occurrence for convicts in pris on to commit murder out of revenge, or hoping to escape by striking down an of ficer of the prison. Suppose now that a hardened murderer expiating his crime at hard labor for life, should kill a fel low prisoner or an attendant, there u-W would be done with him ? That deprav ed murderer would know that he might deliberately kill every man within his reach with impunity, as no other penal ty would be inflicted upen him but what he is now enduring imprisonment for life. Would not such a state of things suit a desperado right well ? He is sup- . i 1 . n ... porieu py the btate (he has to work, to be sure, and so do other folks many as hard as he) and the indulgfince of his murderous disposition "ad libitum" can add nothing to his punishment. Letthe advocates of such a penalty tell us what could be done in such cases. B. Eatox, Shelburn, Nov. 24, 1870. Burlington Free Press. Sharp Practice. The Burlington Free Press tel!s a story of sharp practice in ine country: "a wealthy . Philauel .i:. .i . pin jeuuemau purchased a farm at Stowe, Vt., last summer. He had al most completed his purchase when a hitch in the negotiations occurred. On the farm was a large sugar orchard. ihe owner was willing to sell his farm and transfer the rest of it at once W he wished to reserve the occupancy of uis sugar orchard lor the next year. To this the purchaser objected, and the trade was likely to drop, when the ser vices of the general arbitrator, umnir pacificator and manager of matters in general of the bailiwick were called in. lho umpi e was equal to the emergency. He proposed that the parties should "split the difference," by dividing the time in Jispute his neighbor to have the use of the orchard for the first six months, lrorn November to May, inclu sive, aud the city man to have it there after. Therbiladslphian, whose expe rience with fruit orchards had shown him that orchards wer r.nK , r v.... uiuiu irom May to November than from November to May, assented readily to this proposi tion and the trade was closed. The Ver nionter will have and run his orchard nPKt unrinr. a.! ; . , 6, uu lt remains to be seen how much sugar the city man will make next fall." Peters' Musical Monthly.

It is a well established f;wt, that natives ut'KlorUla rarelv die of con sumption, esjteciftliy those of the southern pait. On the other hand, in New England, one-third at least of the population d.e of this tern hie disease.

My advice lo perwms whose luntra are alfrctM, even slightly. Is to lay inastock 1 1 he bene k a I'ulinomc Hyrup, fci.'Uenck'sSi'aweLd Tonic, and Hchenek'a Mandrake rills, and goto Florida 1 recommend lhce particular medi cines, because 1 am thorough; acquainted with their action, 1 know, that, where they are used In atrict ac cordance with my directions, they will do the work that ia required.

Now, there nrn mnny consumptive who have imt the means to ft to Florida. 1 he qiutst ion may be, asked. Is there no hope for sikIi ? Certainly there is. I. y advice to such is, and evtrhaa been, to stay in a warm rootn during the winter, with a tenH-ratine of al ml seventy degrees, whieh fclumid be kept rt guiaily at that point by means of a thermometer. Let such a pudent ta.e b.s exercise within the limits r-f the room bv walking up and down as much ash. a strength will permit, in order to keep up a healthy circnlaUon ofthe bh!. 1 hsvoeumt thousands by this system, and can do o aain.
