Condensed Report of Address to Washington Special: President Mc Kinley's message to the LVItb, con gress was one of the lengthiest ever i submitted to the senate and house of representatives of the United States. The death of Vice-President Hobart, who passed from this life on the morn ing of Nov. 21 last, is mentioned as an event congress is called to mourn at the threshold of its deliberations. The president pronounces a high enconium upon a private life which was pure and elevated and a public career distin guished by large capacity, stainless in tegrity and exalted motives. In beginning his review of national and international relations and ques tions the president calls attention to the present conditions of unusual pros perity, of universal good will among the people at home and the relations of peace and friendship that exisc wuh cvnn- 1-nvpmmpnt. nf the world. As an element of this unusual prosperity our foreign commerce, it is stated, has shown great inci-ease in volume and value, the combined imports and ex ports for the twelvemonth being the greatest ever recorded in a single year of our history. It is mentioned as a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when the products our manufactories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad were 189S and 1899. Government receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, aggregated $610,982,004.33; expendi tures were 8700,093,564.02, leaving a de ficit of $89,111,559.67. The estimated receipts for the current year aggregat ed $40,958,112; estimated expendi tures, $600,958,112, leaving a surplus of 540,000,000. The strength of the treasury is grati fying. On Dee. 1, 1899, the available cash balance was $27S,004,S37.72, o which $239,744,905.36 was in gold coin and bullion. Customs receipts are nov, almost entirely paid in gold. Owing to this favorable condition of the treasury with respect to the cash on hand compliance with the provisions of the sinking fund, disregarded for eight years on account of deficiencies in the revenues, was resumed, the treasury department purchasing dur ing November 1S,408,500 of the 5 per cent loan of 1904, thus making a net saving of about $2,885,000 in interest. The government will continue to pur chase bonds to the extent of $25,000,000 in all provided these are offered and purchased up to and Including Dec. 23. Increased activity in industry and agriculture and consequent larger em ployment of labor at higher wages adds to the capacity of the people to absorb the circulating medium. These changed and changing conditions have impaired the national banking act as to making the needful addition to the circulation. The attention of congress is therefore invited to this subject with a view to making this act more re sponsive to the people's needs. The president again urges, therefore, that national banks be authorized to organ ize with a capital of $25,000. He also recommends that the secretary of the treasury be given additional power and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds and to employ such other effective means as may be necessary to maintain the parity in value of the two metals, gold and sil ver, and the equal power of every dol lar at all times in the market and in the payment of debts. Gold now seeks the treasury, but adequate provision should be made to insure the continu ance of the gold standard and of pub lic confidence in the ability of the gov ernment to meet all its obligations in the money which the civilized world recognizes as the best. In this con nection the president repeats his form er recommendation that a portion of the gold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks shall be redeemed upon presentation but when once redeemed shall not thereafter be paid out except in gold. Relating to American merchant ma rine it is recommended that legisla tion should be enacted which will give to the country maritime strength com mensurate with its industrial achieve ments and its rank among the nations of the earth. Only in this way can we secure our share in the valuable car rying trade of the world. The present .situation in this respect, the president, ?ays, ir, regarded with humiliation at home and with surprise abroad. On the subject of trusts the presi dent declares they are justly provoking public discussion and should claim the attention of congress. The indus trial commission, created by act of congress June 18, 1898, has not yet completed its investigations of this subject. Whatever power congress has in the way of controlling or check ing these monopolies should be promptly ascertained and asserted. At tention is called to the recommenda tions of President Harrison in his an nual message of Dec. 3, 1889, and to that of President Cleveland in his an nual message of Dec. 7,- 1896, as well as to the act of July, 1890, bearing t: on this subject. It is noted that the fctate legislation to which President Cleveland looked for relief from the evil of trusts has failed fully to accom plish that object, owing principally to the fact that different states take dif ferent views as to the proper way to discriminate between evil and injuri ous combinations and those associa tions which are beneficial and neces His Third Annual Congress, sary to tha business prosperity of the country. The president adds that uni formity in state legislation on this subject is much to be desired and ex presses the hope that means may be found for congress within the limita tions of constitutional power so to supplement an effective code of state legislation to make a complete sys tem of laws and compel a general ob servance of the salutary rules to which he refers. In his view of our relations to for cign states the president notes the set tlerncnt of the long-pending boundary dispute between the Argentine repub lic and Chile, in which the United States minister at Buenos Ayres served as umpire. A convention of extradi tion between Argentina and the United States awaits some slight changes in the text before exchange. Reference is made to the claim of the Austro-IInngarian government for the killing of certain Austrian and Hungarian subjects at Lattimer, Pa., Sept. 10, 1SD7. As the sheriff and his deputies tried for their murder were acquitted by the courts this govern ment, after due consideration, declined to indemnify the sufferers. Note is made of various minor diffi culties and insurrections in certain South American and Central American republics and the changes resulting The Bluefields controversy is still un settled. The events of the past year looking to an isthmian canal are recapitulated and reasons for early action in the matter are urged.. Events in China as far as concerns American interests are recounted and the extension of the area opened to foreign settlement is referred to. The significant statement is made on this subject that our commercial rights in China under existing treaties have teen everywhere maintained during the past year, as they will be in the future. A commission to study the commercial and industrial conditions in the Chinese empire is recommended No time should be lost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field for American trade and enter prise. The Paris exposition and the prepar ations of this country to take part in it are related at length, and the im portance of a representative display is urged. The United States government building, now approaching completion, will be worthy in beauty of architec tural plan and in completeness of dis play to represent this nation. There will be over 7,000 exhibitors for every state of our country, not including ex hibits from Cuba, Porto Rico and Ha waii, for which arrangements have been made. Our relations with Germany con tinue to be most cordial and the state ment is made that in all the promises closer relations of intercourse and commerce and a better understanding between two races having so many traits in common, Germany can be as sured of the most cordial co-operation of this government and people. Vari ous matters pertaining to certain re strictions of trade between the two countries and also the satisfactory set tlement of most of them and a recom mendation for a joint commission of experts and practical men of affairs for the investigation of production and exportation in both countries is urged. As to affairs with Great Britain the work of the joint high commission is recapitulated and the arrival at a har monious modus Vivendi in the Alaskan boundary dispute gives hope of a per manent satisfactory settlement. In other matters the relations between the United States and Canada and Great Britain remain most friendly. In the unfortunate contest between the Boer states of Africa and Great Britain this government has maintain ed an attitude of neutrality. In the exercise of customary good offices of a neutral for the care of British inter ests opportunity has been afforded to show the impartiality of this govern ment toward both combatants. As to the deplorable events at Tallu- lah, La., when five Italians were taken from jail and hanged, the president states that a satisfactory solution of the dispute between the two govern ments in regard to the matter will doubtless be reached. The recurrence of such events leads the president to recommend the conferring upon the federal courts jurisdiction in this class of cases. Mention is made in speaking of our relations with Japan of the treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japan on Nov. 22, 1891, which became operative in July last. It is also stated that Japan is taking a lively interest in the propo sition of the Pacific cable company to add to its projected cable lines to Ha waii, Guam and the Philippines a branch connection with the coast of Japan, whereby the latter would be brought into direct communication with this country. Without repeating his previous recommendations on this subject the president respectfully calls the attention of congress to them and recommends that the postmaster-general be authorized to invite competi tive bids for the establishment of such cable. A review of our relations with Mex ico shows a gratifying record of mu tual good will, one of the latest in stances being the acceptance of Presi dent Diaz of an invitation to visit Chi cago last October, but the illness of a member of his family prevented his attendance. Claims growing out of the seizure of American sealing vessels in Bering sea by Russia have been under discussion for several years with the recent happy result of an agreement to submit them to the decision of a single arbitrator. The important events leading to the dissolution of the tripartite agreement as regards the Samcan islands are recounted and also the satisfactory partition of the islands between Ger many and the United States, Great Britain being given by Germany an equivalent elsewhere. A convention has been made by the three powers to which the attention of the senate will be invited. Concerning events and conditions growing out of the recent war with Spain the message treats very fully. As to Cuba, held by us in trust for the inhabitants with the intent of realiz ing cue high purpose proclaimed in the joint resolution adopted by the con gress on the 19th of April, 1898, the president states that the pledge con tained in this resolution is of the high est honorable obligation and must be kept. All the administration measures adopted heretofore in Cuba by this government have aimed to fit it for a regenerated existence and for self-government within its own sphere. Free Cuba, however, must be a reality, not a name. A loosely-framed common wealth is not to be turned adrift to face the vicissitudes of weaker states, but wise preparation must be made for eventual self-government of re sponsible character. In the Turkish empire the situation of our citizens remains unsatisfactory and claims of many years' standing have not jret been collected, though our government is hopeful in this re gard. Attention is called to the arrange ments made for collecting official and economic data under the international union of American republics and also to the commercial museum of Phila delphia in furtherance of this idea and the Pan-American exposition of 1901 on the Niagara frontier. The president gives a resume of the Hague conference fnd its results in the amelioration of the laws and cus toms of war and says that the historic position of the United States as to en tanglements with foreign nations as duly observed. In regard to the arm-, especially in the Philippines, the message gives fig ures and facts showing the actual number returned, ri.c. Mr. McKinley recommends a special medal of honor for volunteers, regulars, sailors and marines on duty in the Philippines who remained in service after their terms of enlistment expired. The total number of troops now in the Philip pines and those on the way comprise 2,051 officers and 63.4S3 men. The de velopment of the postal system In Porto Rico and the Philippines is stat ed to have been rapid and successful and to be growing with extraordinary popularity in the domestic service or in the United States proper. As to the navy high praise is given it for its efficiency and recommendations are made for necessary legislation and aid in the matter of naval construction as suggested by the secretary of the navy. The statements of the message as to the future of the Philippines are clear and unequivocal. The rebellion must be put down and civil government re stored. Free public schools must be established and the burden of gov ernment equally distributed. Already hundreds of schools are open and filled with children. Religious free dom is sacredly assured and enjoyed. The courts are dispensing justice and business is beginning to circulate in its accustomed channels. The future government of the islands rests with the congress of the United States, and the president adds that a few graver responsibilties have ever been confided to us. If we accept them in a spirit worthy our race and traditions a great opportunity comes with them. The islands lie under our flag. They are ours by every title of law and equity. They cannot be abandoned. If we de sert them we leave them at once to anarchy and finally to barbarism. No specific or final form of government for the islands is recommended. When peace is restored it will be tho duty of congress to construct a plan of gov ernment which shall establish free dom and order in the Philippines. Un til congress makes known the final ex pression of its will the president must use the authority vested in him to up hold the sovereignty of the United States in the islands. When the in surrection ends it will be the hour of peace and clemency. The text of the message, referring to the Philippines, is in full: On Doc. 10, 1S!S, the treaty of peace be ween the United States anr Spain was signed. It proviiioil. among other things, that Spain should ceiie to the United States the archipehiKO known as the Phil ippine islands, that the United States should pay to Spain the sum of $20.- 000, w0, and that tho civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories thus ceded to ih, .'nited States should be determined by he congress. The treaty was ratified bv the senate on the Uh of February, isn't and by the Koverrv.nent of Soain on JIarch VJ following. The ratifications were exchanged on Aprd 11, and the reaty publicly proclaimed. On March 2 he congress voted the sum contemplated by the treaty and the amount was paid vcr to tne fcpam.sh government on May 1st. In thi3 manner tho Philippines came to the United States. The islands were ced ed by the givernrrnt of Spain, which had been In und sputed ros.-esicn of them for centuries. They were accepted not merely by our authorized commissioners In Fans, under the direct on of tho ex ecutive, but by the constitutional and well-considered action of the representa tives ot the people of the United States in both houses of congress. I had every reason to believe, and I still believe, that this transfer of sovereignty was in ac cordance with the wishes and the aspir ations of the great mass of the Filipino peopie. From the earliest moment no oppor tunity was lost of assuring- the people of the islands of our ardent desire for their welfare and cf the intention of this government to do everything possible to advance their interests. In my order of the 19th of May. 1S9S. the commander of the military expedition dispatched to the Philippines was instructed to declare that we came not to make war upon the people of that coun,."nor upon anf party or faction anions them, but to pro tect them !n their homes, in their em ployments and in their personal and re ligious rights." That there should be no doubt as to the paramount authority there, on the 17th of August it was di rected that "there must be no joint oc cupation with the insurgents;"' that the United States must preserve the peace and protect persons and property within the territory occupied by tlieir military and naval forces: that the insurgents and all others must recognize the "mili tary occupation and authority of the United States. As early as December 4. before the ee;-s:on. and in anticipation of that event, the commander in Manila was urged to restore peace and tranquil lity and to iMidertake the establishment of a beneficent government, which should afford the fullest security for life and property. On the 21st of December, after the treaty was signed, the commander of the forces of oocuvaiion was instructed '"to announce and proclaim in the most pub lic manner that we come not as invad ers and conquerors but as friends to pro tect the natives in their homes, in their employments nnd in the personal and re ligious rights." On tiie same day, while ordering Oen. Otis to see that t lie peace should be preserved in Iloilo, he was ad monished ti'jit: "it is most important that there should be no condict with the insjirgents." On the first day of Jan uary, lS'rO. urgent orders were reiterated that the kindly intentions of this govern ment should be in every possible way communicated to the insurgents. On the 21st of January I announced my intention of dispatching to Manila a commission composed of three gentlemen of the highest character and distinction, thoroughly acquainted with the orient. who, in association with Admiral Dewey and Major-General Otis, were instructed to "facilitate the most humane and ef fective extension of authority throughout the islands and to secure with the least possible delay the benefits of a wise and generous protection of life and property to the inhabitants." These gentlemen were Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman. president of Cornell univer sity: the Hon. Charles Denby. for many years minister to China, and Prof. Dean C. Worcester of the University of Mich igan, who had made a most careful study of life in the Philippines. But before their arrival at Manila the sinister am bition of a few leaders of the Filipinos had created a situation full of embar rassments for us and most grievous in its consequences to themselves. The clear and impartial preliminary report of the commissioners gives so lucid and comprehensive a history of the present insurrectionary movement that the story need not be here repeated. It is enough to say that the claim of the rebel leader that he was promised independence by any officer of the United States in return for his assistance has no foundation in fact and is categorically denied by the very witnesses who were called to prove it. The most the insurgent leader hop ed for when he came back to Manila was the liberation of .the islands from the Spanish control, which they had been laboring for years without success to throw off. The prompt accomplishment of this work by the American army and navy , gave him other ideas and ambitions and insidious suggestions from various quar ters perverted the purposes and inten tions with which he had taken up arms. No sooner had our army captured Manila than the Filipino forces began to as sume an attitude of suspicion and hos tility, which the utmost efforts of our officers and troops were unable to disarm or modify. Their kindness and forbear ance were taken as a proof of coward ice. The aggressions of the Filipinos continually increased until finally, just before the time set by the senate of the United States fcr a vote upon the treaty, an attack, evidently prepared in ad vance, was made ail along the American lines, which resulted in a terribly de structive and sanguinary repulse of the insurgents. Ten days later an order of the insur gent government was issued to its ad herents who had remained in Manila, of which Oen. Otis justly observes that "for barbarous intent it is unequaled in mod ern times." It directs that at S o'clock on the night of the 15th of February the territorial militia shall come together in the streets of San Pedro, armed with their boios, with guns and ammunition where convenient; that Filipino families only sh;;ll be respected; but that all other individuals, of whatever race they may be, shall be exterminated without any compassion, after the extermination of the army of occupation, and adds: "Brothers, we must avenge ourselves on the Americans and exterminate them, that me may take out revenge for the infamies and treacheries which they have committed upon us. Have no compas sion upon them; attack with vigor." A copy of this fell by good fortune into the hands of our officers and they were able to take measures to control the ris ing, which was actually attempted on the night of Feb. 22, a week later than was originally contemplated. Considerable numbers of armed insurgents entered the city by waterways and swamps and in concert with confederates inside attempt ed to destroy Manila by fire. They were kept in check during the night and the next day driven out of the city with heavy loss. This was the unhappy condition of af fairs which confronted our commission ers on their arrival in Manila. They had come with the hope and intention of co operating with Admiral Dewey and Major-CJen. Oils in establishing peace and order in the archipelago and the largest measure of self-government com patible with tiie true welfare of the peo ple. What they actually found can best be set forth in their own words: "Deplorable as war is, the one in which we are now engaged was unavoidable by us. We were attacked by a bold, adven turous and enthuiaslio army. No alterna tive was lelt to us, except ignuminous retreat. "It is not to be conceived of that any American would have sanctioned tho sur render of Manila to the insurgents. Our obligations to other nations and to the friendly Filipinos and to our selves and our ilag demanded that force should be met by force. Whatever the future of the Philippines may be, there is no course open to us now except the prose cution of the war until the insurgents are reduced to submission. The commis sion is of the opinion that there has been no time since the destruction of the Span ish squadron by Arirniral Dewey when it was possible to withdraw our forces from the islands, either with honor to ourselves or with safety to the inhabit ants." The course thus clearly Indicated has been unflinchingly pursued. The rebel lion must be put down. Civil govern ment cannot be thoroughly established until order is restored. With a devotion and pallantry worthy of its most bril liant history, the army, ably and loyally assisted by the navy, has carried on this unwelcome, but most righteous cam paign with richly deserved success. The noble self-sacritice with which our sol diers and sailors whose terms of service had expired refused to avail themselves of their right to return home as long as they were needed at the front forms one of the brightest pages in our annals. Al though their operations have been some what interrupted and checked by a rainy ,'eason of unusual violence and duration. they have gained ground steadily in every direction and now look forward confidently to a speedy completion of their task. As to Porto Rico the message states the time is ripe for the adoption of a temporary form of government for the island. Many of the suggestions made with reference to Alaska, it is stated, are applicable also to Porto Rico Changes in the latter, however, should not be made abruptly and racial pe culiarities must be given due weight. The message closes with some perti nent suggestions as to lynchings in the south, the proposed memorial bridge over the Potomac and a statement of the purposes of the executive order re lating. to civil service of May G, 1S96, and a reference to the coming 14th of December, the 100th anniversary of the death of Washington, and the patriotic reflections naturally arising therefrom and concludes with these words . , 1 1 etw nas mis nation naci more abundant cause than during the past year for thankfulness to God for mani fold blessings and mercies, for which we make reverent acknowledgment Morocco's Sultan The late sultan of Morocco, Mulai Hassan, was one of the most striking figures of the Oriental world. Stand ing about 6 feet 3 inches, he was dark in face, having, through a descendant of Mohammed, some negro blood. His clothes, says the author of "A Journey in Morocco," were spotless white, made like those worn by ordinary tribesmen, but of finer stuff. Colors he never wore, nor jewelry, except a silver ring, with a large diamond. Once a man asked him for this as a keepsake. He half drew it off, but replaced it, say ing, with a quiet smile: "No, I will keep it, but you can have its value in money, if you choose." His clothes he never wore more than a day, and his servants claimed them as perquisites, so that his wardrobe must 'have been pretty extensive, even for a king. Upon a journey he carried almost all his possessions packed on camels, and when in need of amusement he would say to a servant, "Bring me the tele scope the Belgian minister gave me ten years ago," or "the watch the queen cf England sent me," and the unlucky man to whom he spoke had to produce the article, if he unpacked a hundred camels in the search. Gold Hearing Sand for Ballast. Golden sand for ballast is the latest development in Cape Nome mining af fairs, and it may revolutionize things Though the matter has been kept quiet, it is a fact that the steam schooner Aloha, which arrived a few days ago at Seattle from Cape Nome, carried fif ty ton3 of beach gravel balast. John H. Bullock, one of the managing own ers of the vessel, speaking of the bal last, said: "It is true. Some of it is the ruby sand, w'hich, we know, con tains gold, and the rest is coarse grav el. We are taking it to San Francisco where it can be treated cheaper and worked to much better advantage than at Capa Nome. But for the ssvere weather, which made it difficult to get the sand, we should have taken 150 tons. Our steamer Albion will proba bly bring 200 tens of this sand. She is en route from Cape Nome either to this city or San Francisco. Should the Aloha's venture rrove profitable, the spectacle of a fleet of vessels taking said ballast from the Cape Nome beaches next summer will be witnessed. Mr. Bullock stated that he believed the Aloha's sand would assay $100 to the ton. St. Louis Globe-Democrat. The Knd of the World. If you want to know just how much the scientists know on the subject, read these six opinions which have been ex pressed during recent years; reconcile them if you can, and then possess your soul in patience: 1. The land surface is diminishing; then the human race will finally be drowned. 2. Ice is grad ually accumulating at the north pole, so that some day the earth will lose its equilibrium and the men will be ut terly annihilated by the rush of mov ing objects. 3. The earth is moving toward the sun; the last man will finally be roasted alive. 4. Water is by degrees becoming scarcer; in ages to come all beings, human and bestial, will perish from thirst. 5. By the be ginning of the year 3000 men will be retrograde; in the end they will be creatures no larger than an inject. 6. The sun is burning up; as old Sol cools, the earth's glacial zones will en large and humanity be frozen to death. A Poet's Philosophy. When a Persian is born a poet, his experience of life usually makes him a philosopher as well. Sidi, whose wiso savings are often quoted, being asked where he learnel his philosophy, re plied: "From the blind, became they never advance a step until they have tried the ground." Again, Sadi raid: "I never complained of my condition but on a single occasion, when my fee! were bare and I had not money to buy shoes; but I saw a man without feet, and became instantly ecr.tcn.i.ed wLtL my let."
