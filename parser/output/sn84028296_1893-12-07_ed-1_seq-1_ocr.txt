Washington, Dec. 4. The message of President Cleveland wan shorter than usual, for hiin, containing but about 13,000 words. In brief it was as follows: To the Congress of the United States: The constitutional duty which requires the president from time to time to give to the congress information of the state of the Union and recommend to tbeir consid eration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient, is fittingly en tered upon by commending to the congress a careful examination of the detailed state ments! and well sunnorted recommenda tions contained in the reports of the heads of departments, who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the govern- iint. Tn an effort to abridge this commu nication as much as is consistent with its nnrnnsA. I Khali sunnlement a brief refer ence to the contents of these departmental reports by the mention of such executive himinpRS and incidents as are not embraced therein, and by such recommendations as appear to be at this particular unie appro priate. Foreign Relation!. Whila our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been en tirely free from perplexity, no embarrass ing situation remains that will not jrield to the spirit of fairness and love of justice, . which, joined wi.th consistent firmness, characterize a truly American foreign policy. Mv predecessor having accepted the office of arbitrator of the long standing missions boundary dispute, tendered to the president by the Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys commissioned by those stated to lay before ine evidence and arguments in behalf of their respective governments. The outbreak of domestic hostilities In the Republic of Brazil found the United States alert to watch the interests of our citizens in that country, with which we . carry on important commerce. Several vessels of our new navy are now, and for some time have lxxn, stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The struggle being be tween the established government, which controls the machinery of administration. and with which we maintain friendly rela tions, and certain omens ol tue navy ein . ploying the vessels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and chief seanort. and lacking, as it does, the ele ments of divided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgentscan reason ably claim recognition as belliurerants. Thus far the positiou of our government has been that of an attentive but) impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict. The convention between our government and , Chili, having (or its object the settlement and adjustment of the demands of the two countries against each other, has been made . effective by the organization of the claims commission provided for. The two governments failing to agree upon the third member of the commission, the good offices of the president of the Swiss republic were invoked, as provided In the treaty, and the selection of the Swiss representative in this country to complete the organization was gratifying alike to the United States and Chili. The vexatious question of so-called legation asylum for offenders against the state and its laws was presented anew in Chili by the uu- ' authorized action of the late United States minister in receiving into his official resi dence two persons who had just failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges were pending, grow ing out of a former abortive disturbance, the doctrine of asylum as applied to this case is not sanctioned by the best precedents, and, when allowed, tends to encourage se dition and strifes Under no circumstances can the representatives of this government be permitted, under the ill-denned fiction of extra territoriality, to interrupt the ad ministration of criminal justice in the countries to which they are accredited. A temperate demand having been made by the Chilian government for the correction of this conduct in the instance mentioned, the minister was instructed no longer to harbor the offenders. The legislation last year known as The Geary Lair, quiring the registration of all Chinese la borers entitled, to residence in the United States and tuetieportation of all not com- plying with the provisions of the net with- ln the time prescribed, met with much op position from Chinese m this country. Acting upon the advice of eminent counsel that the law was unconstitutional, the great moss of Chinese laborers, pending jurdicial inquiry as to its validity, in good faith declined to apply for the certificates required by its provisions. A test case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was bioupht before the supremo court, and, on May lo, 1893, a decision was made by that tribunal sustaining the law. It is believed that under the recent amendment of the act extending the time for registration, the Chinese laborers thereto entitled, who desi.e to reside in this country, will now avail themselves of rnh? ZlfiAlZS&i to remain, anu mat tiiereoy ine necessity oi enforced deportation may to a great do- gree be avoided. ..,.. It has devolved upon the United States minister at Peking, as dean of the diplo matic body, and in the absence of a repre sentative of Sweeden and Norway, to press upon the Chinese government reperation for the recent murder of Swedish mission aries at Sung Pu. The question is of vital interest to all countries whose citizens en gage in missionary work in the interior. , By article 12 of the general act of Brus- sels, signed July 8, 1890, for the suppres- sion oi tne slave trade, and the restriction .j.. ,.... pendent state of the Congo and in the ad- j."--"" btates and the other signatory powers s punishment of persons selling arms and ammunition to tbe natives and for the confiscation of the inhibited articles.

Costa oca nas lately testmea its inendll- bess by surrendering to the United States in the absence of a convention of extradi tion, but upon duly submitted evidence of criminality, a noted fugitive from justice. It is trusted that the negotiation of a treaty with that country, to meet recurring cases of this kind will soon be accomplished. t In my opinion treaties for reciprocal ex tradition si ould be concluded with all those countria with which the United careea nas not aireaay conventional ar rangements of that character. I have deemed it fitting to express to the govern ments of Costa Hica and Columbia the kindly desire of the United States to see their pending boundary dipute finally closed by arbitration in conformity with the spirit of the treaty concluded between them some years usa Our relations with the French republio continue to be inti mate and conlial. I sincerely hope that the extradition treaty with that country, p f- by the senate, will soon be operatiTe. ., .xicasionaLqnestions affecting our nHtili-nlissfd citizens returning to the land of their birth have ariten in ourintfrcourse with Germany, our relatious with that country continue satisfactory. The questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations are in progress between the two governments wit u a view to such concurrent action as will make the award and regulations aureed nnon bv the Behring sea tribunal of nrbitmtion practically effective, nnd it is not doubted that Great Britain will co operate freely wit h this country for the ac complishment of that purpose. ' The dispute growing out ot ine aiscnm Inatinu tolls of the Wclland canal, upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake Dorts of the United States, was ad justed by the substitution a more equita ble schedule of charges. And my prede cessor thereupon suspended his proclama tion imposing discriminating tolls upon British transit through our canals. A request for additions to the list of ex traditable offenses covered by the existing treaty between the two countries is uuuer consideration. During the past year an American citizen employed in a subordinate commercial position in Hayti, after suffering a pro tracted imprisonment on an unfounded charge of smuggling, was finally liberated upon judicial examination. Upon urgent representation to the llaytian government, a suitable indemnity was paid to the suf ferer. By a law of Hayti, a sailing vessel having discharged her cargo, is refused clearance until the duties on such cargo have been paid. The hardship of this measure upon American ship owners who conduct the bulk of the carrying trade of that country has been insisted on with a view of securing the removal of this cause ot complaint. Upon receiving authentic information of the firing upon an American mail steamer touching at the port of Amapala because her captain refused to deliver up a passen ger in transit from Nicaragua to Guate mala upon demand of the military authori ties of Honduras our minister to that coun try under instructions protested against the wanton net and demanded satisfaction. The government of Honduras, actuated by a sense of justice and in a spirit, of the ut most friendship, promptly disavowed the illegal conduct of itrs ollicers I'.nd expressed sincere regret for the occurrence. lt is confidently anticipated that a satis factory adjustment will soon lie reached cf tho questions arising out of tbe seizure and Use of American vessels by insurgents in Honduras aud the subsequent denial by the successful government of commercial privileges to those vessels on that account. A'Yotable part of the southeasterly coast of Liberia, between the Cavally and San Pedro rivers, which for nearly half a cen tury has been generally recognized as be longing to that republic by cession and purchase, bos been claimed to bo under the protectorate of prance in virtue of agree ments entered into by the nativo tribes over whom Liberia's control has not been wpll maintained. More recently negotiations between the' Liberian representative anu tne jtrencn government resulted in the signature at Paris of a treaty whereby as un adjust ment certain Liberian territory is ceded to France. This convention tat last advices had not been ratified by tho Libenaa legis lature and executive. Feeling a sympathetic- interest in the fortunes of the little commonwealth, the establishment and development of which were largely aided by the benevolence of our countrymen, nnd which constitutes the only independently sovereign state on the west coast of Africa, this government has suggested to the French government its earnest concern lest territorial impairment in Liberia should take place without her unconstrained consent. ' Our relations with Mexico continue to be of that close and friendly nature which should always characterize the intercourse of two neighboring republics. The work of re-locating the monuments marking the boundary between the two countries from Paso del Norte to the Pacific is now nearly completed. The commission recently organized un der the conventions of 184 and 1889; it is expected, will speedily settle disputes growing out of the shifting currents of the Kio Grande river east of El Paso. Nicaragua has recently passed through two revolutions, the party at first success ful having in turn been displaced by an other. Our newly appointed minister, by his timely good offices, sided in a peaceful adjustment of the controversy involved in the nrst connict, The larire American interests established in tnat country in connection witn me Nicaragua canal were not molestedV The Nicaragua Canal company has un fortunately become financially seriously embarassed, but a generous treatment has been extended to it by the government of Nicaragua. The United States are es pecial ly i nteres ted in th e successful achieve ment of the vast undertaking this company I i,as m charge. That it should be accom- plished under distinctively American aus pices and its eujoyment assured not only to the vessels of this country as a channel of communication between our Atlantic and Pacific seaboards but to the ships of the world in the interests of civilization, is a proposition which, in my judgment, does not admit ot question. Led by a desire to compose differences and contribute to the restoration of order in Samoa, which for some years previous had been the scene of conflicting foreign pretensions and native strife, the United States, departing from its policy, conse crated by a century of observance, entered four years ago into the treaty of Berlin, thereby becoming jointly bound with England and Germany to establish and : wAatf H11 kmg of , gamoa. The treaty provided for a foreign court of justice; a municipal council for the district , tf Aniiv with n fnmiirt, mvicirl . tl,Ainrtf authorized to advise the king; a tribunal for the settlement of native and foreign land titles, and a revenue system for the kingdom. It entailed upon the three powers that part of tbe cost of the new government not met by the revenue of the isiunus.

Mataafa, an aspirant to tne tnrone, and a large number ol bis na- tive adherents were in open rebellion on one oi tne isianas. Quite lately, at the request of the other powers, and in fulfillment of its treaty ob ligations, this government agreed to unite in a joint military movement of such di iiicusiuiiQ as , u n in iMuunuiv secure LUO surrender of the insurgents without bloed- mensions as would probably secure the Bm3(1 The warship Philadelphia was ac- cordingly put under orders for Samoa, but bEfore she arrived the threatened conflict was precipitated by King Mali- etoa's attack upon the insurgent camn Mataafa was defeated and a number of his men killed. The British and German nw- al vessels present subsequently secured the surrender of Mataafa and his adherents, The defeated chief and 10 of his principal supporters were deported to a German is- land ot the larshal group, where they are held as prisoners under the joint responsi- bility and cost of three powers. An extradition treaty with Norway has recently been exchanged and proclaimed, Hawaii. It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our relations with Hawaii have caused serious vmbar M.smeut. Just prior to the installation of the present administration, the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly sverlbrown and a treaty of annexation had beeu negotiated between the provisional overu:r.ent ol tne islands anu tne umteu tates and submitted to the senate f jr rati fication. This treaty I withdrew forexam ination and dispatched Hon. James A. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commissioner to make an impartial investigation ci tne circumstances aiienu ing the change of government, and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination, Mr. Blount submitted to me hU report, showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representatives to that govern ment and through the intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States, which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our min ister. Upon the faets developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our gov ernment to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us md to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible Intervention. With a view of accomplish ing this result within the constitutional limits of executive power and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities growing out of any chanced conditions, brought about by our unjustifiable inter ference, our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instructions to that end. Thus far no information of the accomplishment of any definite results has been received from him.- Additional advices are soon expected. When received they will be promptly sent to the congress, together with all other in formation at hand, accompanied by a snecial executive messnsre fully detailing all the facts necessary to a complete undeiv standing of the case, and presenting a his tory of nil the material eventB leading- up to the present situation. Arbitration By a concurrent resolution, passed by the senate Feb. 1, 1890, and by the house of representatives on the 3d of April follow ing, tho president was requested "To in vite, from time to time, as tit occasion may arise, negotiations with any government with which the United States has or may have diplomatic relations, to the end that anv differences or disnutes arising between the two governments which can not be ad justed by diplomatic agency may be refer red to n rbitration and be peacably adjusted by such means." April 18, 1890, the international Ameri can conference of Washington, bv resolu tion, expressed the wish that all controver sies between tne republics ot America ana the nations of Europe might be settled by arbitration and recommended that the gov- c intent of each nation represented in that conference should communicate this wish to all friendly powers. A favorable re sponse has been received from Great Brit ain in the shane of a resolution adopted by parliament July 18 last, cordially sym- puuiiziug wim Hie purjjuac m vict ouu ex pressing the hope that her majesty's gov ernment will lend ready co-operation to the government of the Uuited States upon the basis of the concurrent resolution above quoted. It affords me signal pleasure to lay this parliamentary resolution before the con gress, and to express my sincere gratifica tion that the scntimfent of two great and kindred nations is thus1 authoritatively manifested in favor of the rational and peaceable settlement of international quar rels by honorable resort to arbitration. Ambassadors Since the passage of the net of March 3, 1893, authorizing the president to raise the grade of our envoys to correspond with the rank in which foreign countries accredit their agents here, Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany have conferred upon the lrreprcsentatives at this Capitol the ti tle of ambassador, and have responded by accrediting the agents of the United States in those countries with the same title. A like elevation of mission is announced by Russia and when mode will be similarly met. The step fittingly comports with the position the Lnited States hold in the fam ily of nations. During a former administration I took occasion to recommend a recast of the Laws Relating to the Consular Service In order that it might become a more efficient agonay in the promotion of the in terests it was intended to subserve. The duties and powers of consuls have been ex panded with the growing requirements of our foreign trade. Discharging important duties affecting our commerce and Ameri can citizens abroad, and in certain countries exercising judicial functions, these oifieers should be men of character, intelligence and ability. Upon proof that the legislation of Den mark secures copyright to American citi zens on equal footing with it3 own, tho privileges of our convrnrht laws have bepn extended bv proclamation . to subiects of mat country, Treasury. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1893, amounted to S461,71d.5tH.,U and its expenditures to $59,iiT4,tiT4.2y. There was collected from customs $305,;i05, 016.78 and from internal revenue $161,027, 633.93. Our dutiable imports amounted to t421.85C.711. an increase of S52.453.907 over the preceding year, and importations free toe urcueumti ycur, turn imuunauous iree ofditydmoSnting to $444,544,211, a de- crease from t .e preceding year of $13,455,- 447. Interna revenue receipts exceeded those of the preceding year by $7,147,445.32. On the first day of November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds in circula tion, or not included in treasury holdings, was $1,718,544,6S2, an increase for the year of $112,404,947. Estimating our population at 67,426,000 at the time mentioned, he pjr capita circulation was $35.49. On the same date there was in the treasury gold bullion amounting to $96,657,273, and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $126,261, 653. July 14,1890, during the last fiscal year, The purchases of silver under the law of aggregated 54,008,102.59 fine ounces, which cost $45,531,374.53. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that the law became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the first day of November, 1893, was 168,674,590.40 fine ounces, which cost $155,930,940.84. Between the first day of March, 1873, and the first day of November, 1893, the government purchased, under all laws, 503,003,717 fine ounces of silver at a cost of $518,622,948. The silver dollars that have been cmned under the act of July 14, 1890, number 86,087,285. The seigniorage arising from such coinage was $6,977,098 89, leaving on hand in tbe mints 140,699,760 fine ounces of Silver, which cost $126,758,218. Our total coinage of all metals during 875 pieces valued at $48,665,178 90, of which there are $30,035,140 in gold coin, $5,848,717 j . ii ',.-i. LM:? " tne lasn nscai vear rnnsiKten nr M7 loev in silver dollars, $7,217,220.90 in subsidiary suvar coin, ana i,w-i,iu.ao in minor coins. It is estimated that on the first day of July, 1893, the metallic stock of money in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted to $1,218,559,169, of which $597,097,685 was gold and $615,861,484 was suver, Tho recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by thlgoveromeitosa feature of our mon- etarv scheme has mart an nt.ir cham in the complexion of our currency affairs. I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far- reaching. In the nature ot things, however, it is impossible fa know at this time precisely what conditi .ns will be brought about by" the change, or what, if any, supplementary la insisting jasa. la tha iivAt at audh can- dltions, appear to no essential or expedient. Of course, after the recent financial per turbation, time is necessaiy for therees tablishment cf business confidence. When, however, through this restored confidence, the money which has been frightened into hoarding places is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently sound currency nbundant'y kuilicieut to meet every requirement-of our Increasing population and business. In the pursuit ef this object wo should reso lutely turn away from alluring and tem porary expedients, determined to be con tent with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In these circumstances, I am convinced that a reas onable delay in dealing with this subject instead of being injurious will increase the probability of wise action. The MonetBrjr Conference which assembled at Brussels upon our in vitation was adjourned on the 30th day of November, m the present year. The considerations just stated and the fact that a definite proposition from us seemed to be expected from us upon the re assembling of the conference, led us to ex press a willingness to have the meeting Mill further postponed.- it seems to me mat it wouia ue wise to give general authority to the president to invite other nations to such a conference at any time-when there should be a fair pros pect of. accomplishing an international agreement on the subject of coinage. I desire also to earnestly suggest the wis dom of amending the existing statutes in regard to the issuance of government bonds. The authority now vested in tbe secretary of treasury to issue bonds is not as clear as It should be, and the bonds authorised are disadvantageous to the government both as to the time of their maturity and rate of interest. j The superintendent of f immigration, through the secretary of th treasury, re ports that during the lost nscai year tnere arrived ht our ports 440,793 immigrants. Uf these l.ora were not permitted to land under the limitations of the law, and 577 wcr'o returned to the countries from whence thev came by reason of their having be come public charges. The total arrivals were 141,um less man ior tne previous year. K War. The secretary of war reports that the strength of the army on the 30th day of September last was ao,7 73 enlisted men and 2:144 officers. The total expenditures ot the department for the year ending JuneSO. 1893, amounted to $51,966,074.89. Of this sum $1,992,581.95 was for salaries and contingent expenses, 123.377.828.35 for the sunnort of the mili tary establishment, $6,077,033.18 for miscel laneous objects and $20,515,631.41 for public works. This latter sum includes $15,296,- S76. 46 for river and harbor improvements, and $3,260,141.20 for fortifications and other Works of defense. The total enrollment of the militia of the several states was on the 31st of October of the current year, 112,537 officers and en listed men. The officers of the -army de tailed for the inspection end instruction of this reserve of our military force report that increased interest and marked prog ress are apparent in the discipline aud efficiency of theArgauization. Neither Indian outbreaks nor domestic violence have called the army into service during the vear. and the only active mili tary duty required ol It nas Been in tne de partment of Texas, whete. violations of the neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were promptly and efficiently dealt with by the troops, eliciting tne warm ap proval of the civil and military authorities ot potn countries. It is gratifying to note that we have" be gun to attain completed results in the com preheasive scheme of sea coast defense and fortification, entered upon eight years ago. A large sum has been already expended, but the cost of maintenance will be incon siderable as compared with the expense of construction and ordnance. The manufacture of heavy ordnance keens pace with the current needs, but to render these guns available for the pur poses they are designed to meet, emplace ments must be prepared for them. Pro gress has been mode In this direct ion, and it is desirable that congress, by adequate appropriations, should provide for the un interrupted prosecution of this necessary woik. After much preliminary work and exam ination in accordance with the require ments of the law, the board appointed to select a magazine rifle of modern type with which to replace the obsolete Springfield rifle of the infantry service completed its labors during the last yean, and the work oi manufacture is now in progress at the national armory at Spriusfield. It is con fidently expected that by the end of the current year our infantry will be supplied with a weapon equal to that of the most progressive armies of the world. The work on the projected Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military par! has beeu prosecuted with zeal and judg ment, aud its opening will be celebrated during the coming year. The reports of the Military academy at West Point and the special schools for special instruction of ollicers show marked advance in the education of the army and a commendable ambition among its officers to excel in toe military profession and to fit themselves for the highest service to the country. The Report of the AttornoT General contains the usual summary of the affairs and proceedings of the department of jus tice ior the post year, together with cer tain recommendations as to needed legisla tion on various subiects. I can not, ton heartily indorse the proposition that tne , . -- .f I V lflf "iBfH0 ,to lh.e comPe1i- tion of llmteri Slatps a1,tnrnvi. mfiruhle clerk of federal courts and United States commissioners, should bo abolished with as little delay as possible. The report of the postmaster general contains a detailed statement of the opera tions o tbe postoffice department during the last fiscal year and much interesting information touching this important branch of the public service. The business of the mails indicate with absolute certainty the condition of the bus iness of tbe country, and depression in financial affairs inevitably and quickly re duces the postal revenue. Therefore a larger discrepancy than usual between the postoffice receipts and expenditures is the expected and unavoidable result of the dis tressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the time covered by the postmaster gener al's report. There was a deficiency last year of nearly $8,000,000. The total number of postoffices in the United States on the 80th day of June, 1893, was 68,403, an increase of 1,284 over the pre ceding year. Of these 8,360 were presi dential, an increase in that class of 204 over the preceding year. The report of the secretary of the navy contains a history of the operations of his uepartment aunng tne past year, and ex- Dibits a most gratitying condition of the personnel ot our navy, lie presents a satis- factory account of the progress which has been made in the construction of vessels, fnd H?es nu.mber r recommendations to which attention is esneciallv invited to which attention is especially invited.

Great ansa, r-mid firn g-"S. tnTrnHnrq and iuv. Since 1886 congress has, at each session, authorized the building of one or more vessels, and 5 e secretary of the navy pre sents an earnest plea for the continuunce of this plan. He recommends the authoriza tion of at least one battle ship aud six tor pedo boats. t While I am distinctly in favor of con sistently pursuing the policy we have in augurated of building up a thorough and efficient navy, I caunot refrain from the suggestion tVt the congress should care fully ta'.te into account the number of un finished vessels on our hands and the de pleted condition of our treasury In consid ering the propriety of an appropriation at this time to begin new work. The method of employing mechanical labor at navy yards through boards of labor and ninking efficiency the sole test by which laborers are employed and continued is producing the best results and the secre tary is earnestly devoting turn sen to its de velopment Attention is invited to the statements of his report in regard to the workings of the system. Pensions. The secretary of the interior has the supervision of so many important subjects that his report is of especial value and in terest. On the 30th day of June, 1893, there were on the pension rolls 966,012 names, an increase of 89.944 over the num ber on tbe rolls June so, ur these there were 17 widows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers, the survivors of the war of 1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,516 survivors and widows of the Mexican war, 8,882 survivors and widows of Indian wars, 284 army nurses and 475,-6-15 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the war of the rebellion. The latter number repre sents those pensioned on account of disa bilities or death resulting from army and navy service. Tho number of persons re maining on the rolls June 80, 1893, who were pensioned under the act of June 27, 1890, which allows pensions on account of death and disability not chargeable to army service, was 4o,l.io. The number added to the rolls during the year was 123,084, and the number dropped was 33,690. The first payments on pensions auowea uunng tne year amount ed to $33,756,849.95. This includes arrears, or the accumulation between the timefrom which the allowance of pensions dates and the time of actually granting the certifi cates. Although the law of 1890 permits pen sions for disability not related to military service, yet as a requisite to its benefits a disability must exist incapacitating appli cants ' from the performance ol manual labor to such a degree as to render thorn unable to earn a support." xne execution oi tms law in its eariy stages does not seem to have been in ac cord with its true intention, but toward the close of the last administration an authoritative construction was given to the statute, aud since that time this construc tion has been followed. This has had the effect of limiting the operation of the law to its intended purpose. The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roil by means of wnolesale and gigantic irauus, tuo com missioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which Beemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending a complete examination giving notice to the pensioners in order that they might have fax opportunity to establish, if possible, the jnstice of their claims notwittistanduig ap parent invalidity.

I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not bu exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudulently put. upon theso rolls is a wicked imposition up on the kindly sentiment in which pensions have their origin; every fraudulent pensioner has become a bad cit izen: every false oath in support of a pen sion has made perjury more common, and falso and undeserving pensioners rob the people not only of their money, but of the patriotic sentiment which the survivors of a war, fought for the preservation of tVj Union, oujjlit to inspir?. .

In the last fiscal year this aggre gate was greatly reduced, but nevertheless reached $615,000,000, being 75.1 per cent of all American commodities exported. A review of our agricultural exports with special reference to their destination will show that in almost every line the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ire land absorbs by far the largest proportion.

' The work of the statistical division of ! the department of agriculture deals with all that relates to the economics of farming. The main purpose of its monthly reports is to keep the farmers informed as fully as possible of all matters having any influence I upon the world's markets in which Uieir products find sale. Its publications relate especially to the commercial side of farm ing. i It is therefore of profound importance and vital concern to the farmers of the TTniti u ..i. .J. half of our population, and also of direct iuterest to the wholo country, that the t t .i!..i; i, -t-.: ' .i work of this division be efficiently per formed ard tt1 'nformation it has gathered be promptly diffused. It is a matter for congratulation to know that the secretary will not spare any effort to make this part of his work thoroughly useful. In each stat s and territory an agricul tural experiment station has been estab lished. Thesj stations by their very char acter and nam.) are the proper agencies to experiment witn and test new varieties of seeds, ainiljyet this indiscriminate and wasteful distribution by legislation and legislators continues, auswenng no pur- pose unless it be to remind constituents mat tneir representatives are willing to re member them with gratuities at publie cost.

The total quantity of flower and vegetable seeds thus distributed were con tained in more than 9,000.000 packages, and they wre sufficient, if planted, to cov er 89,596 acres of land. In view of t..ese facts this enormous ex penditure without legitimate returns ot benefit ought t be abolished. Anticipat ing a consult! riiion so manifestly in the interest of good administration, mure than $100,000 has been stricken from tbe esti mate mnde to cover this object for the year ending June 80, 1895; and the secretary recommends that the remaining $'5,OC;0 of estimate be confined strictly to the pur- ennse ot new ana improveu varieties oi seeds, and that these be distributed through experiment stations. Thus the seed will be tested, and after the test hns been com pleted by the experiment station, tne pro pagation of the useful varieties and the re jection of the valueless may safely be left to the common sense of the people. Clvtl Berries. The continued Intelligent execution of the civil service law and the increasing ap proval by the people of its operation are most gratifying. The recent extension of its limitations and regulations to the em ployes at free delivery postoffices which has been honestly and promptly accom plished by tho commission, with tne hearty co-opcrauon oi tue postmaster general, is an immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system. I am, if possible, more than ever convinced of the incalcula ble benefits conferred by the civil servico law, not only in its effect upon the public service, but also, what is even mora im portant, in its effect in elevating the tone of political life generally. The course of civil service reform in this country instructively and interestingly il lustrates how strong a hold a movement ' gains unon our people which has underly ing it a sentiment of justice nnd right and which at the same time promises better ad ministration of their government.

Tariff. After a hard struggle tariff ret'ut'in is di rectly before us. Nothing so important claims our attention and nothing so clear ly presents itself as both an opportunity ana a duty an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow-citizens and aduty imposed upon us by our oftrepeatcd pro fessions and by the emphatic mandate of the people. After full discussion our coun trymen have spoken in favor of this reform and they have confided tue worx ot its ac complishment to tho hands of thosa who are solemnly pledged to it. If there is anything in the theory of a representation in public places of the peo ple and their desires, if public officers are really the servants of the people, and if po litical Dromiscs and professions have any binding forces, our failure to give the re lief so long awaited win be sneer recreancy. ynthTny should intervene -So distract our BUY AN ULSTER And Keep Warm.

One Powder attention or cr.stro uc: cirnrs- cr.t,i taut reform is accomplished by wise and careful . legislation. While we should staunchly adhere to the principle that only tbe necessity of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other federal taaxtion and that they should be limited by strict economy, we can not close our eyes to the fact that eon- ' ditions have grown up among us which in justice and fairness call for discriminat ing care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our government actually demand. Mamrestly, if we are to aid the people directly through tariff reform, one of its most obvious features should be a reduc tion in present tariff charges upon the nec essaries of life. The benefits of such a re duction would be palpable and substantial, seen nnd felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clotbeil and better sheltered. These gifts should be the will ing benefactions of a government whose highest function is the promotion of the welfare of tbe people. Not less closely re lated to our people's prosperity and well being is the removal of restrictions upon the importation of the raw materials nec essary to our manufactures. The world should be open to our national ingenuity and enterprise. This can not be while federal legislation, through the imposition of high tariff, for bids to American manufacturers as cheap materials as those used by their com petitors. It is quite obvious that the en hancement of the price of our manufac tured products resulting from this policy not only confines the market for these pro ducts within our own borders to the direct disadvantage of our manufacturers but also increases their cost to our citizens. The in terests of labor are certainly, though indi rectly, involved in this feature of our tariff system. The sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturers to sup ply the limited demand for their, goods, soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension of work In mills and factories, a discharge of employes and distress in the homes of our. workingmen. Even if the often disproved assertion could be made good that a lower rates of wages would result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the intelli gence of our worWngmcn leads them ni.lrW tn Hi,2fnvr,i .l,nt. t.liplr fitinilv ,,!. tlon to tar It legislation. , " A msasuro has b?cn prepared by the ap ' Opriate congressional committee em ying tariff reform on -the HneB -herein suggested, which will be promptly sub mitted for legislative action.

The committee, after full consideration, and to provide against a te-nporary de ficiency which may exist before the busi ness of the country adjusts itself to the new tariff schedules, have wisely embraced in their plan a few additional internal rev enue taxes, including a small tax upon in comes derived from certain corporate in vestments.
