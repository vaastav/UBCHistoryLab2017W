PAPERS OF EUROPE CRITICISE MESSAGE London Press Declares Utter ances Against Intriguers Were Too Indefinite. "CONTINUOUS SCOLDING" AMAZES BERLIN CRITICS "Has Germany Spent Her $50,000. 000 in Vain?" Asks the Matin of Paris. LONDON, December 9.?In an edi torial this morning dealing with Presi dent Wilson's message to Congress the Morning Post, referring to that passage In which the President speaks of the necessity of the United States holding aloof from the conflict, so that "some part of the great family of nation:? should keep the processes of peace alive," observes that if Mr. Wilson re gards the nations as making one fam ily, and in this domestic circle the United States is included, it is at least odd that the I'nited States should be so majestically independent of the de sires and feelings of her relatives. The editorial proceeds to argue that President Wilson strangely misunder stands the nature of the conflict, which it says is a struggle for the preserva tion of civilization and not a mere clash of contending ambitions. "Allies Fighting for U. S." Then, quoting passages from the President's denunciation of the disloy alty of naturalized citizens, the edi torial contends that they are proof that the entente allies are fighting indirect ly for the United States. "What." says the editorial, "stands between America and 'creatures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy* in their armed millions but the British fleet. For unless America is prepared to renounce what President W ilson calls a 'common cause of national in dependence and poltiicnl liberty' she is the next objective of t'.erman ambi tions which go unslaked as long as there remains one independent and freei nation." Criticism by Pnll Mall Gazette. Expressing the view that President Wilson's denunciation in his message of the activities of war plotters was too mild in general, and not sufficiently discriminatory between unneutral con duct and crimincil conduct, the P#ll Mall GazeCte saws: even goes^ so far as to suggest that the acts of'an assassin or a dyna miter are chi*#ly heinous as exhibi tions of unneuf ral conduct, and that equal censure must fall upon every American who fails to "keep the scales of judgmeeit ev? n and prove himself a partisan of no 'nation but his own.' " The Westminster Gazette comments most synijMithei icaily upon the practi cal difficvUaies confronting the Presi dent and his ?'highly honorable rea sons for rrvinq to keep his western world railed oft, from European chaos." but fears t.iai his denunciations may even be re:.5ar4'.ed as compliments by those to whom'they are addressed.

JULIUS A. WEST I |80 7th St, Cor. H I ' Mail Orders Solicited?J tack upon President Wilson, nnyint* that it has long known that he was anti-German, but that he never before had given rein to his hatred in this fashion. "This 'neutral' government's head has hardly a word of reproach for the shameless incitements of the jingo press against Germany. * * * But he insults as traitors, anarchists and dis honorable persons those men in whom love for the old fatherland lives and who rise up against the despicable things done against them daily." The Kreuz Zeitung says that thus far there has been no sufficient evi dence of German plots against the United states to justify the words of the message. "Re that as it may," continues the newspaper, "Germany cannot be made responsible for them. There is nobody in Germany who approves of them. President Wilson, however, seems not to appreciate the psychology of those who allow themselves to be induced to commit such excesses through their in dignation over the unscrupulous and unlimited support of the enemy of their old fatherland which America permits itself through President Wil son's policy." The Vossische Zeitung uses over its Washington dispatch summarizing the message the headline, "Wilson Against the German-Americans," but does not comment upon the document. Comment is likewise lacking in the newspapers other than those mentioned. "Animated by Righteous Anger.'' ! 

PARIS, December 9.?T'nder the cap tion "Gulliver Wakes I*p" Joseph Rei nach, the political writer, in an article in the Figaro comments at length on President Wilson's message to Con gress. He declares that the message was animated by righteous anger, al though not altogether free from meta physics. It is evident, says M. Reinach. that the President was moved to the deepest indignation by the revelations in the trial of the directors and sev eral employes of the Hamburg-Ameri can steamship line on a charge of con spiring to defraud the government. The Matin says: "The progressives, the republicans and the majority then draw together before the danger of the German-American terrorist. Has Germany spent her $50,000,000 in vain?" "President Wilson, who is an honest man. has finally lost patience," says La Liberte, in commenting upon the President's message to Congress. "His message has been preceded by a series of measures of a diplomatic nature, showing a determination on his part no longer to be scoffed at by William II and by his agents." The Journal des Debats STiys that if President Wilson's message is dull on the subject of neutrality it is vehe ment against the attitude of certain German-Americans. The newspaper reproaches the President for not hav ing protested when Relgian neutrality was violated and war declared on France. Dutch Press Is Silent. THE 

HAGUE, December 8, via Don don, December 9.?The Dutch newspa pers almost unanimously refrain from commenting on the President's mes sage, preferring to await the arrival of its full text. The Nieuwe Courant, however, says: "The message contains nothing to arouse a belief that there is a likelihood of a diplomatic breach be tween the I'nited States and Germany."

Only a few days ago, it is said, the sick man was told that one of his feet would have to b*- amputated because of gangrene, and since tliat time he showed feigns of despondency more pronounced than at the tirnv he shot himself.
