Cbe JJjjtpjttrWotim Register. H. L. SNYDER, Editor and Proprietor, Shkphkrdstowx, W. Va. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1889. ; ? . ? ? ? ' This is going to be a hard winter on the United States Treasury. Thk office-seekers are making Con gressman McComas's life a burden to hin?. Jkpfersox Davis is dead. Let him that is without guilt first revile his spotless character. Thk G. A. R. evidently thinks that the sole duty of Congress is to pass reckless pension laws. It may not be generally admitted, but the thoughtful people of the country expect a trreat deal from the minority in Congress. Thk Republican majority in Con gress is very small and consequently \ quite uncertain. The majority will ( have to walk the chalk line. AXOTHKR ocean steamer has beaten the record. If this sort of thing keeps j up there will soon be more w recks \ than records to make note of. Although but little more than a week has passed since it was made public, there is not one echo heard from the President's message. Coxgrkssmkx are always very will ing to spend other people's money, but it goes mighty hard with them when the joke is turned as Silcott turned it. Joh.N Waxamakkr, Postmaster General and proprietor of the Phila delphia bargain store, has just se cured a government contract to fur- ' nish eighteen brass cuspidors to the War Department at forty cents per I cuspidor. Skxator Mandkrsox, whose con nection with the re-rating of pensions under the Tanner regime is not al together creditable to him. has intro. duced a bill in the Senate which if passed would make our pension ex penditures run up into the billions. Thk extraordinary sum of $97,210, 252 is demanded from Congress to pay the pension bills for the next year under the present laws. And still the G. A. R. and the other pen sion grabbers of the Republican party are not satisfied, but are howl ing at the doors of Congress for yet more extravagant measures. Thkrk is one position in Washing ton that seems to go a-begging. It is a place connected with the Geological Survey, and pays $900 a year. But the man who fills it must be a geolo gist. terminologist, and a draughts man, well up in paleozoic inverte brate paleontology and mesozoic in vertebrate paleontology. Now. who wants the job? One Renter Q. Mills. ofTexus. waaablgman ? .a r or two ago. He was chairman of t!>e Wavs aud Means Committee of the Houne, and *?. the paternal ancestor of a bUlwhlc he honored with hts own name Haaany^ body heard from Mr. Mills recentlj .-lar kersburg Journal. 0>*K Benjamin Foraker was a big u>ana month or two *go. (iovtrnor of Ohio and one of the lead Has anybody heard from Mr. I- oraker recently? _ Secretary Proctor declined to place the flag of the War Department at half-mast on the announcement of the death of Jefferson Davis, ^-Sec retary of War, although this is a cus tom of long standing. The Secretary acted wisely, for had he done so the unforgiving enemies of the dead Con federate would have raved for months And yet that same flag has been low ered for much worse men than Jeffer son Davis. Judge Brkwkr, who last week was nominated by the President to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, has been, we are told, a farmer in Massachusetts, a lawyer in Missouri, and a superinten dent of public schools in Kansas. We do not know when he was su perintendent of schools in Kansas, but we sincerely trust he is in no way re sponsible for the following questions and answers at a recent State exam, ination of teachers of public schools in that commonwealth. "W e quote from the Western School Journal: Question 1. What personal characteristics of the settlers caused the threat difference be tween the colonies of Virginia and Massa chusetts? Virginia: They were idle and wasteful. There were comparatively few laborers among their number, but a long list of forty eight -useless gentlemen," and several par doned criminals. They regarded themselves as mere sojourners and adventurers, ex pecting to dig gold, trade with the Indians, get wealth and return home. They had dlf nculty with the Indiana. Massachusetts: They were not mere ad venturers, but Industrious, educated, enter prising and virtuous people. They came to secure religious freedom, and with no ex pectation of returning. They made a solemn treaty of friendship with the Indians, which was faithfully kept for fifty years. What was the relative character of the first settlers of Jamestown aud Plymouth? The settlers of Jamestown were not accus tomed to work, and came to the New Woild In search of adventure and wealth. They were therefore poorly fitted to be pioneers. The settlers of Plymouth were hard-work ing. God-fearing people. They came not for wealth nor adventure, but to found home for themselves aud their children. They were, in brain, brawn and principle, well adapted to lay broad, deep and solid the foundations of a great commonwealth. We suppose if the Kansas Jayhawk ers are determined to teach their . children such rot there is no law to prever t it. But we would just like to know who is responsible for the pro mulgation of such untruthful, mean and prejudiced ideas. We hope no man has been or ever will be raised j to high office who calls the witch. | burners of Massachusetts educated and virtuous people in the same breath that he describes the patriotic pioneers of \ irginia as idle and w asie ful adventurers and criminals? who teaches that the self-sacrificing sons of the grand old "Mother of Presi dents" were inferior to the narrow minded, Puritanical settlers of New England, who may possibly have come in search of religious freedom but who persecuted and destroyed those who disagreed with them. Did the late superintendent of sehoole in Kansas subscribe to these sentiments when be was engaged in educational work in that State? OUR 

WASHINGTON LETTER. Washington, D. C., December 10, 1889. EdUor Register.? There was great ex citement about the Capitol last Thurs day morning when it was whispered around that there was a defalcation on the part of one of the officers of the House. The defaulter is Craven E. Silcott, of Ohio, the cashier to the sergeant-at-arms, and the amount of money he got away with is about $72,000. He drew the money from the Treasury Department to pay the sala. ries of the members of Congress, but instead of doing so went to New York and is undoubtedly safe in Canada with his ill-gotten gains. The cause of Silcott's downfall is attributed to betting on the races and running two families at the same time. The com panion of his flight is a woman who has been quite notorious around Washington for some time past. The defalcation would have been impossi ble were it not for the loose manner in which business is conducted at the Capitol, where no safeguards what ever are thrown around the disburse ment of public money. Many mem bers of Congress are out sums of money ranging from $500 to $5,000, they having signed receipts for their money before it was drawn from the Treasury, but it is probable a bill will be passed reimbursing them. Silcott was a Democrat, and would have been bounced in a few days. Since the meeting of Congress the different departments of the govern ment have been overrun with mem bers of Congress looking for places for their constituents. The Postoffice Department is visited by a larger num ber of Senators and Representatives than any other. The postoffices are the magnet that draws them there. It would seem that Cheap John Wanamaker was bouncing enough postmasters to satisfy the most impla cable place hunter, but still there are Republicans who claim that he is going too slow. In the other depart ments the pressure for places is almost a> great, and the axe of the headsman is falling right and left. There was an interesting examina tion held in the hall of the House of Representatives Wednesday night. It was strictly private, and was for the purpose of selecting two reading clerks for the House at the nice little salary of $3,600 per year. The idea of having the candidates for the places rehearse their vocal powers in private was conceived by Mr. Mc Pherson, the clerk, who has the ap pointment of the readers. Among I the many other candidates who ! showed how nicely they could read | were W. H. Wisner, of Martinsburg. ! and W. W. Meek, of West Virginia. Nepotism has begun early in the United States Senate this session. Senator Moody, of South Dakota, is the person who did it. He secured the appointment of his son, Warreu Moody, to be a page on the floor of the Senate at $2.50 per day. < >fflcials of the Senate, some of whom have been in service a quarter of a century or more, say that this is the first in stance within their recollection when a Senator's son has filled the office of page. Probably the father could not support his family on the salary of a does not talk as much as Corporal Tanner did, he gets there just the same. During the month of Novem ber there were 14.189 pension certifi cates issued. The number of certifi cates issued in the same month of 1888 was 10,087; of 1887, 8,002; and of 1886, 7,385. Miss Jennie Harrison, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, the daughter of a cousin of President Harrison, has been appointed to a position in the folding room of the Government Printing Office. If the family can't get big salaries they are satisfied to take little ones? but one more rela tive is provided for, anyhow. Speaker Heed to-day appointed committees on Ways and Means, Ap propriations, Manufactures, Elections and Mileage. Mr. Wilson is the only member from West Virginia appointed as yet, and he heads the list on the minority representation of the Com mittee on Manufactures. The West Virginia Republican Asso ciation lias elected John W. Mason, S. M. Howard, C. M. Shinn and G. W. Z. Black as delegates to the National Republican Association. Col. Jake Kemple, of Wheeling, who calls himself "the celebrated West Virginia orator and humorist," is advertised to lecture Saturday evening in this city on "Civil service, or the great political nightmare.1" Win. A. Turner, of Martinsbnr^, has been appointed a compositor in the Government Printing Office. X. A Slap in the Face. At Charleston, this State, last Sun day morning W. A. McCorkle, a Dem ocrat and prominent attorney of that city, and the same gentleman who defended aud cleared J. S. McDonald, chairman of the Republican executive committee of the district, in the cele brated election bribery ease in the United States District Court, was dis cussing the case in the dining-room of Hotel RufTner with Gen. George C. Sturgiss, United States district attor ney, who prosecuted the case, and Gen. Sturgiss made a remark to Mr. McCorkle about the burial of Jef ferson Davie, when H. S. White, Uni ted States marshal for West Virginia, interrupted the conversation and said to Mr. McCorkle, who is a Virginian and whose people were all in the Con federate army, that Jefferson Davis ought to be buried in the Potter's field. Mr. McCorkle remarked that the Southern people did not intend to humiliate themselves in the matter of Mr. Davis's burial and left the room. White came into the lobby a few miuutes afterwards, and ap proachiug McCorkle, the latter told him that he was surprised at the re mark, that it was uncalled for and unkind to hiui, and White not offer ing an apology, McCorkle slapped his (White's) face with bis hand. Friends interfered and prevented further trouble. The matter has caused a great deal of excitement, and whether there will be a hostile meeting between those gentlemen is not as yet known. McCorkle, upon slapping Marshall White, announced to him that he would grant him any satisfaction at any time and place he (Marshal White) might name.

DEATH OF JEFFERSON DAVIS. Jefferson Davis, the ex-President of. the Southern Confederacy, died at 12.45 o'clock last Friday morning at the residence of his Hfe-long friend, J. U. Payne in New Orleans. The an nouncement of the event created a profound sensation, although the death of Mr. Davis had been expected at any tinl'e within the last month. Four weeks ago. while traveling on a river steamboat, he caught cold and his condition became so serious that his physicians refused to allow him to return to his home in Mississippi. Mrs. Davis was sent for and immedi ately joined her husband and re maiiied with him until the end. Mr. and Mrs. Davis were as devoted to each other as when in their youth they eloped to be married. For three days defore his death Mr. j Davis had been getting steadily bet ter, and was much improved, so the physicians thought. AH dav Thurs day the favorable symptoms con tinued, but at 6 o'clock in the even ing. without any assignable cause, Mr. Davis was seized with a conges tive chill which seemed to absolutely i crush the vitality out of his already enfeebled body. So weak was Mr. Davis that the violence of the assault soon subsided for lack of vitality ; upon which to prey. From that mo ment to the time of his death he sank : gradually. At 7 o'clock Mrs. Davis administered some medicine, but the ex-President declined to receive the whole dose. She urged upon him the necessity of taking the remainder, but putting it aside with the gentlest of gestures, he whispered, "Pray, excuse me." These were his last words. Gradu ally he grew weaker and weaker, but never for an instant seemed to lose consciousness. Lving peacefully upon his bed. and without a trace of pain apparent in his features, he remained for hours. Silently clasping and ten derly caressing his wife's hand, he awaited the end. Finding that Mr. Dav,s was breath ing somewhat heavily as he lay upon his back, the doctors assisted him to turn upon his right side. With his cheek resting upon his right hand, and with his left hand drooping across his chin, he lay for some tifteen minutes breathing faintly. More and more feeble became his respirations until they passed into silt nee. and then the watchers knew that the father of the Confederacy had passed away. After death the facc of the deceased, though looking slightly emaciated, showed no trace of suffer ing. It is believed that the foundation of the ex-President's last illness was malaria, complicated with acute bron chitis. Careful nursing and skilled medical attendants had mastered the latter, but it is supposed that the con gestive chill, the immediate cause of death, was attributable to a return of the malaria. The news of Mr. Davis's death was promptly telegraphed to all the lead ing cities of the South, and thousands of messages expressive of respect for the dead Confederate and sympathy with Mrs. Davis have been received. Everywhere in the South there were public manifestationsof sorrow. Flags were at half-mast on the State Houses in Atlanta, Montgomery, Richmond, Jackson, Raleigh, Nashville, and Columbia, and on public buildings in many other cities. A fund was started in Atlanta to erect a monu ment. Montgomery sent an appeal to Mrs. Davis to have the remains buried there under the Confederate monument, the corner stoue of which is to be ornamented with a life-size bronze statue of Mr. Davis, Memphis, Richmond, Jackson, Miss., Atlanta, and Macon made similar requests. The Legislature of South Carolina adopted resolutions of sympathy with Mrs. Davis, alluding to her husband as the most distinguished statesman of the South and as "one of the ablest and purest the country ever had.1' The Virginia Legislature also appoint i ?ie coniecVeJrate' Survivors' Associa tion at Augusta and the Society of the Army and Navy of the Confederate States at Haltiinore arranged for memorial meetings in those cities. Meetings of citizens were arranged for in other cities. At Augusta. Charleston. Raleigh. Lynchburg. Nor folk, Savannah, Memphis, Jackson, Miss., Columbus, Ga., and elsewhere shops were draped in black and bells were tolled. Jefferson Davis was born on June 3, 1808, iu what was then part of Chris tian county, but is now Todd county, Kentucky. His father was a planter, and moved, while Jefferson was a bov, to Wilkinson county in Missis sippi. The boy received some aca demic education at home, and then went to Transylvania University in his native State. At 10 he received a West Point appointment and en tered the Military Academy in the same class with Robert E. Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston. Graduating in 1828, he was assigned to the infant- J ry, and three years later won such distinction as a staff officer in the ; Black Hawk war that he was promo- ! ted in 1833 to the rank of First Lieu- 1 tenant and Adjutant in a new regi ment of dragoons. This gave him i two vears of active service on the frontier in expeditions against the 1 Pawnees and other hostile Indians. Mr. Davis had a taste for military life and appeared likely to make a good record in the army, but he was ambitious of distinction in civil life, and accordingly after seven years of service, he resigned his commission in the summer of 183o. A love affair had its influence also, for shortly after leaving the field he married the daughter of Zachary Taylor, then a Colonel in the army, and later Presi- j dent. Returning to Mississippi he became a cotton planter, a few miles 1 from Yicksburg, and lived for eight years in retirement, devoting much of his time to careful study with ref ence to a public career. His first ap pearance in politics was as a delegate to the Democratic State Convention of 1843, and he at once enrolled him- ! self as a follower of Calhoun. Mr. Davis made swift progress in politics. In 1844 lie was chosen a Presidential elector on the Polk and Dallas ticket, and in 1845 he was elect ed Representative in Congress. He heartily approved the Mexican war, and he made in May, 1849, a strong speech in favor of a resolution of thanks to his father-in-law and the officers and men of Gen. Taylor's army. Two months later he joined that armv, being elected in July Colonel of the First Regiment of Mississippi Vol unteers. He promptly resigned his seat, overtook his command at New Orleans, and was soon at the seat of war. He led his troops gallantly in the storming of Monterey in the* fol- ; lowing September, being compliment ed bv Gen- Taylor with a place on the j commission appointed to arrange the terms of capitulation, and he espgc- j iallv distinguished himself at the bat- j tie of Buena Vista. Feb. 23, 1847. where ' he was severely wounded. In September, 1847. the Governor of Mississippi appointed him to fill an unexpired term in the Uuited States Senate. The subsequent legislature promptly re-elected him almost with out opposition. He became conspicu ous in the Senate as an advocate of \ States' rights, and at once took a fore most place aiuong the gpeat men of that day. In 1851 he resigne4 his seat in the Senate to become a candi date for Governor, for which office he was defeated. jn 13.53 President Pierce appointed Mr. Davis as bis Secretary of War, and he held this place until 1857, when he was again elected to the Senate. He w^s iij the front rank of orators and statesmen in the troublous timet that ensued, and in January, 1800. he resigned his seat aud went South. When the 1 Confederacy was fonued he was elected President by a unanimous vote. His course as a brave and de voted leader to the cause he had es poused is well-known to all. At the close of the war he was raptured near Irwinsville, Ga., by Union soldiers. He was taken to "Fortress Monroe, where he arrived May 19, and was 1 confined almost two years. On May 10, 1867, he was removed to Rich mond. arraigned in the United States District Court upon the charge of ? treason, and admitted to bail in $100,000, Horace Greeley heading? the list of bondsmen. After a brief stav in Richmond, Mr. Davis went to Canada. In the summer of 1868 an offer of a partnership, without put ting in any capital, in a Liverpool firm, drew him to England, but he concluded not to accept it. and after a brief visit to France he returned. At the next Democrat term of court a nolle prosequi was entered by the Government, and he was discharged, while he was included in the general amnesty proclamation of the follow ing Christmas. Mr. Davis settled in Memphis, and became president of a life insurance company, but after some years of business life he retired to a comfor table estate presented by an ardent admirer at Beauvoir, on Mississippi Sound. Here he has passed his old age, spending much of his time in study, and only occasionally issuing forth to defend and glorify the "lost J cause." In 1881 he published an elab orate work entitled. "The Rise and Fall of the Confederacy/' Mr. Davis hasone child. Miss Winnie Davis, who has been called the "Child of the Confederacy." She was born in Richmond during the war and is a remarkably handsome woman. Miss Davis is now traveling in Europe with Mrs. Joseph Pulitzer. Proceedings of the Confederate Memo rial Association. At a late meeting of the Confederate Memorial Association of Shepherds- j town a coiiimitee, composed of John H. Zittle, Rev. L. R. Mason, Joseph , McMurran and Col. Win. A. Morgan, I was appointed to draft a memorial ] and resolutions expressive of the feel- j iiigs of the old Confederate soldiers j : in reference to the death of the Hon. j Jefferson Davis. i The report of the committee was ! unanimously adopted, as follows : We have heard with unfeigned sor row of the death of our late beloved ! chief, ex-President Davis. Our grief i is natural, and it is right and proper i that we should feel deeply his death, ! as he has been made a vicarious sac j rilice for us in suffering for long years | for the acts of the whole people of j the South. Hence, our mourning is ! unreserved and comes full from our ? hearts. As a soldier of undoubted ! courage, he turned the tide of battle : in our favor in the dark hour at Buena Vista; as Secretary of War, he honored that office and made im provements in that department that , redound to his honoreveu to this day; [ as a statesman, he was pure, honest, i faithful to the interest of the whole : country, and as a debater had few < equals. Called to the Presidency of ' the Confederate States by the unani mous voice of the Southern people in their struggle for the maintainance of their rights guaranteed to them iu the Constitution in the only way left them, he showed that same firmness, honesty and purity of purpose that had always characterized his public acts, and in the long years of suffer ing and persecution which he has since endured, and under the intense hatred and misrepresentation heaped upon him. lie has maintained that i same quiet dignity, noble manhood ! and Christian spirit that always marks the true hero. We gave him our ready obedience j when he was our President; we gave j him our heartfelt sympathy and i love when he was in prison and in irons and exposed to all sorts of in sult for our sakes; when in the re tirement of his private life, and still persecuted by liis enemies, we gave ftitU .ftM* .ftiimijatl^y JWi-esTfrom his sorrows and sufferings, we would be untrue to ourselves, did we not honor his memory. Therefore: Resolved, 1st, That we, the surviv ing soldiers of the "Red Cross," will ever cherish the memory of Jefferson Davis, as a man of untarnished honor, a statesman pure and honest, a true j hero and patriot, worthy of imitation | by all who would honor their country | of become worthy of the confidence I of their tellowiuen. Resolved, 2(1, That we display the ! national flag at half mast furled and i draped in mourning, during Wednes I day December 11, 1S89, the day of the funeral of the great chieftain of the i South. Resolved , 3d, That we extend to Mrs. i Davis our heartfelt love and syinpa i thy in her sad bereavement, assuring her that we, the old soldiers of the South, unite and join with her in the common sorrow that has fallen upon our whole Southland. Resolved , 4th, That a copy of this ! proceeding be forwarded to Mrs. Jef ' ferson Davis, that it be put upon the 1 record of the Association, and the papers of the county be requested to publish it. Resolved , 5th, That Memorial Servi ces be held in the Episcopal Church of this place on Wednesday, the 11th of December, between the hours of 12 and 1 o'clock, the Chaplain of the Association, Rev. L. Ii. Mason, officiat ing. John H. Zittlk, J.. R. Mason, Joseph McMurran, William A. Morgan, Committee. Memorial services for ex-President Jefferson Davis were held in the Epis copal Church of Shepherdstown on Wednesday at 12 o'clock? the hour when the funeral of Mr. Davis took place at New Orleans. The services were conducted by the rector of the church Rev. L. Ii. Mason; Rev. Charles (ihiselin, of the Presbyterian Church, formerly of Virginia; and Rev. J. R. Van Horn, of the M. E. Church South, who fought and bled for the lost cause After the service of the ohurch had been said. Rev. Mr. Mason, who was one of the boys in gray himself and battled fur his principles on many a hard-fought field, delivered an address. He made a solemn and impressive appeal to the living to prepare them ! selves for the last great call. Paying a high tribute to the character of the leader who sacrificed so much and who endured so much, he urged his hearers to emulate those high trait* i of manliness and courage and patience and purity of personal and public life that were exemplified in the dead leader. No word of bitterness was spoken, and the rector pointed out qqly lesions of love and true manli ness. Mr. Mason was followed by Hon. A. R. Boteler, a member of the Confederate Congress, who added his tribute of praise, speaking from his personal knowledge of the ex-Presi dent. The Confederate veterans of this community attended the services in a body, headed by Col. W. A. Mor gan, Commandant. The church was filled with people from the town and surrounding country, and the deepest interest was manifested. The chancel furniture was heavily draped in black and at the headquarters of the veter ans the flag was furled at half-mast %nd carried the badge of mourning. The business houses were closed during tbe services.
