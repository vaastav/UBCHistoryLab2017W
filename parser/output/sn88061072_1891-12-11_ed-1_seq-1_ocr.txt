A GOOD TIME. fl 1'UIJKliS OP- A HARD TASK That Speaker Crisp Finds Star ing Him in the Face. How Will He Make Up the Vari ous Committees? A Majority of the Member. Are New Hen and Much Conferring Will lie Necessary to Determine Their Abilities. Will He Reward the,Men Who Worked Day and Night for Him ? Washington, Doc. 11. As a- slight specimen of the tremendous duties and perplexities that meet the speaker in his job of making tip the committees take a single instance, that of Alabama. There are eight members. All of them were Crisp's friends, and fought for him night and day Forney is in the direct line of the chairmanship of the com mittee on appropriations. The speaker, to refuse him the place, must over-ride the unwritten law and all dictates of friendship. Wheeler should be the chairman of the committee on military aifairs, and all the south expect to have it. Herbert stands in the same relation to the com mittee on naval affairs, and Bankhead Is the legitimate chairman of the com mittee on public buildings and grounds. Upon all grounds of succession, ex perience and friendship these four men from a-single state have a right to ex pect and demand the chairmanship of these four important committees. Speaker Reed, in the last congress managed to name his committees be fore the holiday recess, but Speaker Crisp's task is a harder one, as a major ity of the 2114 members are new men, and a great deal of conferring is neces sary to determine their respective abili ties. Members who are supposed to" be close to the speaker Bay Mr. Mills will certainly be offered the ways and moans committee. It is thought that Mr. Bland will receive the eoinago com mittee.

Plan for the Abolition of Trade-Opreao-ing Duties Imposed by Several States. Washington, Dec. 11. The bureau of the American republics has received a copy of the plan for the abolition oi internal customs duties in the republic of Mexico, recommended to the govern ment by a committee appointed some months ago. It is well known by all who have studied the subject that the system of customs dues imposed upon imported merchandise by the states and municipalities of Mexico, in addition tc those imposed at the custom house on the border by the general government, has been a source of great annoyance and a serious obstacle to the extension of trado; therefore the several states, at the suggestion of the federal power, committed to a commission of eminent economists the duty of proposing a solu tion of the problem. After nearly a year devoted to the investigation of the subject, they recommended the follow ing: Prom the 1st day of July, 1S93, both na tional and foreign merchandise shall be absolutely free in its circulation within the national territory. As a consequence: First Neither the federal government nor those of the states shall impose any of the taxes known as the Alcabala, Port ! azgo, Consumo and Package dues, or any other tending to prevent or restrict the movement of goods. Neither shall they impose any tax on the mere transit of j goods in the internal commerce of the! country, subject to taxation of any kind; I the introduction of merchandise into, or! tho extracti of merchandise from, the territory of any of tho states, or forbid ; either operation except for reasons of po-1 lice; impose (Inferential duties on! domestic goods according to the place of their manufacture, or origin, nor estab lish any distinctions in taxation excepl ing such as are found ou the kind aud quality of the gootls. Second Only the federal authorities are empowered to impose transit duties, and then only on foreign merchandise passing through the country. Third Neither domestic merchandise nor foreign merchandise legally imported shall, in its '"dilation through the coun try, be conli. d to any given route or he liable to cxa. dilation or search, pr need to be accumpai' . by any fiscal document; saving, however, all such regulations as tho federal authorities may draw up fur the introiliic' ion of foreign merchandise. Four For gn merchandise, when con verted into .omestic merchandise by h process to be more exactly determined by a special law. shall be on the same footing as domestic .-rchandise as regards gen eral and loca. taxes.

The cot ton re turns of December to the department of agriculture relate to average prices ci plantations. The complaint of uiiremu-' nerative values is general and the declaration frequent that the crop does not return cost of production. A feeling of discouragement pervades the report and a disposition to reduce area is ex pressed. The plantation price, which is the ac tual rate for cotton sold at the gin, aver ages T.: cents per pound. For five veal preceding the range was from 8.1 to and averaged nearly f4 cents. This de cline is echoed in the records of exporta tion which averaged in October a value of 8.9 cents against 10. 11 cents for (K tober of last year, a drop of l'i per cent. The state averages are as follows: Virginia, 7 cents; North Carolina. 7.4: South Carolina. 7.4; Georgia. 7 4; Flor ida. 7.8: Alabama, 7.:i: Missis-ijii. 7.M: Louisiana, 7.;i; Texas, 7; Arkansas, 7.3: Tennessee, 7.3.

CAPTURED. He Claim to Have Killed Ninety-Nine Men. Mumphihs, Dec. 11. Talton Hall, one of the most notorious" border desperadoes of Kentucky and West Virginia, was captured here by Detectives Pryde and Hedrick Wednesday. He is wanted for killing Enos D. Hylton," a deputy mar shal at Norton, Wise county, Va.; but beyond that crime ho had a record of blood euuied by few criminals in the country. Do was a leader in the famous feud between tho Howards, Turners and Eversoles, of Letcher county, Ky. All of the principals and most of the relatives were killed in the fend, that raged for years in the mountains, and which occasioned the calling out of the militia on several occasions. On one oc casion twenty-two members of the Turner gang, including Turner, were killed. Had was in tl :t. ir:lit. On an other occasion he and nis gang pursued Eversole to Booneville, and, not finding their man, they burned the town. The prisoner claims singly and in posses to h ive slain ninety-nine men. This is doubtless an exaggeration, but that he has killed a score or more there is no doubt. . ' Ho was a deputy United States mar shal under tho desperate Wyatt, and in a tight with moonshiners the posse killed six men. He killed a policeman in Maysvil Ky., and killed the first husband o. his wife that he might marry her. He is a brave man, abso lutely fearless, and in appearance a typical m intaineer, tall, raw-boned and straight as an arrow, with piercing gray eyes. He is only forty years old. His wife resides here, and the detect ives have been watching the house ex- Eecting hii. to visit her. They surprised im in bed. Ho had a Colt's revolver and a Winchester within reach, but toe officers got the drop on him and he yielded, lor a time, before his identity was known, he drove a street car here, worked on a railroad and boarded in the same house with one of the city police. MARRIED HER NEPHEW . Tne Discovery of Her Terrible Mistake Causes Her to Commit Hulrlde. Cklina, O., Dec, 11. Mrs. II. Went worth, of St. Joseph, this county, com mitted suicide Wednesday by using chloral hydrate. She had taken about thirty grains, and when found she was lying in a large arm-chair with the dead ly poison in her hand. About a year ago a stranger arrived at this little vil lage, claiming to be a Texas ranchman, and giving his name as Howard Went worth. He lieing young and seeming to possess considerable money, soon became a favorite with the fair sex and took a fancy to a widow, Mrs. Segrove. After a short courtship the nuptial knot was tied, and all seemed to lie happy with them until a few days ago, when a gentleman friend of Wentworth, from Texas, called to pay the couple a visit. During a conversation and talk ing of the family history it was dis covered that Mrs. Segrove was an aunt of Wentworths, she also being a native of Texas. But during the rebellion her family had been broken up and scat tered, so she was lost to her relatives. She left home quite young. A legal separation had been asked for, and it is supposed that her grief at the thought of separation led her to the above deed. An Old .Man Shot Down. Neosho, Mo., Dec. 11. C. E.

CHILI'S DEFIANCE, 7f Kept t'i, Will, Donbtles Rennlt lu Serious Trouble. Washington, Dec. 11. That part of the president's message relating to Chili is regarded as significant. The president says that the reply of the Chilian authorities has been couched in an offensive tone. He adds that unless Chili makes ade quate and satisfactory response he will by sjiecial message bring the subject to the attention of congress for further action. The only possible meaning of this statement is that congress would be asked to adopt a belligerant attitude to ward Chili. Anything short of that could bo conducted by the president without further authority from con gress. He can adopt defensive measures m case of invasion, but the constitution prevents offensive steps without the sanction or direction of congress. The only construction possible, there fore, is that the president will put upon congress the burden of adopting a war like front in case Chili continues her offensive and defiant attitude. For the last month all the available war vessels of the navy have been directed south ward. Simultaneous with the president's special message to congress the secre tary of the navy will be able to make the statement that a powerful fleet has been mobilized in Chilian waters. The news comes from Chili that the president's message is regarded by the Chilians as decidedly menacing a rup ture between the two countries as it is believed Chili will neither apologize nor pay any material indemnity. Tho ma jority in congress is known to be opposed to any concession, and tne Chilian gov ernment would find it difficult to carry the necessary support tor any humiliat ing measures. It is now no secret that the govern ment is proceeding actively with war like preparations, and that artillery of the latest manufacture has been or dered from Germany. The situation is complicated by Spain's demand for a large indemnity. The Chilians have always detestetl the Span iards, and tho hatred is quickened by this demand. They would challenge Spain if they had not the United States to deal with. 

SUFFERING STRIKERS. Situation Serious Among the Miners at ltra7.il, Indiana. Brazil, Dec. It. The second distri bution of finances received from head quarters of the United Mine Workers was distributed here Wednesday. Over $500 was allowed for this district, which has been distributed among several hun dred dependent families, making an ex ceedingly scanty sum for each individual to live on for the next two weeks. Con siderable dissatisfaction prevails here among the miners, and many needy families are in our midst, notwithstand ing President Comnnsky's report that all is wen nere, ana everytnmg in excellent condition. Unless the distributions are more elaborate many miners will lie compelled to work or sutler for the nec essaries of hie. The state of affairs here at present is very depressing and is rapidly growing worse. Over men are at work in the block coal mines and at the old prices. White Cap notices and large bunches of switches wero placed at several miners' doors Wednesday night, who were working m tho mines, .bvery in dication points to serious trouble here, unless all mines are closed, as those who are not in favor of working vow they will wreak vengeance on every black legger.

POSTAL REFORM Suggestcil by the Convention of PostolHce Inspectors. An Extention of Free Delivery Recommended. Should Include Towns of 5,000 Inhab itants and ail.OOO Postal Hevenue Aa- Dually Salaries and Clerk Hire Reg istry, Money Orders and Postal Motes. Should Display the American Flag. Washington, Dec. 11. The third an nual conference of the chief postoffico lusjiector and inspectors in charge of di visions, which has been in session in this sity for the past two weeks, has ad journed. A larger number of topics re lating to the postal service than wer considered at any previous meeting wer taken up, discussed and acted upon. In regard to free delivery service the in spectors recommend that the delivery of mail by carrier be extended to include towns of 5,000 people and $3,000 postal revenue per annum. In the matter of salaries and the clerk hire allowances of postofnees, it was rec ommended that in all cases where addi tional clerk hire allowance could be granted by the department for the pur pose of promoting employes, the salaries of the lower grade clerks should be first increased, so as to recognize in a sub stantial way the merits of this most de serving class of hard wording employee. In regard to the registry and money order systems, it was recommended that postoftices be kept open more hours than at present, so as to enable the general public to transact business with this de partment of the postoffice outside of their regular working hours. The postal note system is recommended to be modi iiee by the issuance of money orders in lieu thereof, for the same price charged for postal notes of equal amount under the present plan, provided that the maxi mum amount st what are now postal note offices lie fixed at $10. It was sng- ested that all postmasters and rusto ians of postoffice buildings should be charged with the duty of keeping the American flag suitably displayed. 

ANOTHER MOVE TO MOVE GRANT. Congress W ill lie Asked to Have the Remains Transferred to Washington. Washington, Dec. 11. The removal of the remains of General Grant from New York to the national cemetery of Arlington will lie proposed again during the prosent session by Senator Plumb. He proposes to introduce at an early date a concurrent resolution 'providing for the removal of the remains and to ask that it lie upon the table. He will not ask to have it referred to any com mittee, but will keep it upon the table until a favorable occasion for its con sideration and will then call it up and ask for its passage by the senate. He has no donbt that it will pass by a safe majority, as it did liofore, but he does not pretend to express an opinion as to its fate in the house. It will be likely to encounter their strong opMsition from the' inemlierH, as it did in the last congress. Washington, Senator Plumb considers the proper place for Grant's body and tomb, because it is the capital 'of the na tion which he did so much to save. It is the place from which he set forth on that part of his military career which closed the rebellion, and it is the scene of his service of president, where his familiar figure became endeared to thousands. The tomb of Grant in the national cemetery of Arlington, Senator Plumb thinks, would attract the ad mirers of his fame from all parts of the world, and would be a much more ap propriate shrine for their devotion upon the heights by the quiet Potomac than in the heart of New York, close by rush ing railway trains and the whirr and bustle of the greatest trading city of the western continent. Ilia; dinner at Hobbs, Ind. Tipton, Ind., Dec. 11.
