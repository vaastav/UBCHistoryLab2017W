SAINT PAUL GLOBE. JIL FULLS TODAY. Opening of Congress Causing Very little Ex* citement in Washington. ANNEXATION THE MAIN TOPIC. nai/ic Win Bring the natter dullQuUl l/uVlc) Before the Senate at the Earliest floment Practicable. In the House the Nelson Bankruptcy Bill Will Probably Be One of the Earli est Measures to Secure Consider ation—Cuban Matter Will Have to Take Its Course With Other leg islation. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.— The regular, or long session of congress, as it is call ed, because there is no constitutional limitation upon the period of its dura tion, opens at noon tomorrow. The leaders and a large majority of the members of both houses are here to participate in the opening ceremonies, and President McKinley has made the journey to Washington from the bed side of his dying mother that his ab sence might not delay the national leg islature at its assembling. The extra sessions robs the opening of the reg ular session of the excitement and in terest which usually attach to it. On the eve of a regular session ordinarily Washington thrills with excitement. The hotel lobbies surge with place hunters in the wake of the various candidates for speaker, clerk, door keeper, etc.; the members are strug gling for committee assignments, and the- air is full of rumors of plots and counterplots. But, as the house was completely organized at the extra ses sion, and all the committee assign ments were made then, beyond the natural stimulus produced by the re turning statesmen, the regular hang ers-on of legislation and the outlining of schemes by members of the "third house," or lobby, Washington tonight is tranquil. The programme in the house tomorrow is very simple, and be yond the spectacular show which it of fers to the curious has, in itself, little attraction. The house will be called to order by the speaker, who, after the chaplain's invocation, will direct the clerk to call the roll. This having been accomplished and the presence of a quorum demonstrated, the clerk will be directed to notify the senate that the ; house is ready for business, and a com mittee will be appointed to wait on the president. After that, there will be a recess to await the arrival of the presi dent's annual message, which will be read upon its reception and be followed by an adjournment until Tuesday. This is the regular routine, and unless some thing unforeseen occurs will not be de parted from. It is the intention of the house lead ers to proceed with the business of the session as rapidly as possible. The committees will all begin their labors this week, and, as all of them have more or less bills on hand which were introduced at the extra session, there will be r.r> lack of material for the hcuse to work on after the committees have begun to grind. The appropria tions committee has been at work for ten days, and Chairman Cannon ex pects to pass at least two of the reg ular budgets before the holidays — the legislative, executive and judicial and the pensions appropriation hills. One or the other of these bills, it is ex pected, will be reported by Wednesday, and the end of the week promises to see the house down to business. Among [ the early general measures to receive consideration will be the 

BANKRUPTCY BILL. Whether it will be the Nelson bill which passed the senate at the last session or a modification of the Torrey bill depends on the temper of the ju- < diciary committee, which will submit ' the measure to the house. Beyond j doubt there will be several resolutions of inquiry during the first week which may be more or less sensational, and some of the radical pro-Cuba members will attempt to get consideration for a Cuban resolution before the foreign affairs committee can act. Congress man Livingston, of Georgia, is one of these. But, owing to the nature of the ■ house rules, all these hasty efforts will i prove abortive, and they probably will take their regular course. There will be nothing except indis- ! position on the part of members to prevent the senate's entering upon its work upon convening tomorrow, as there is a calendar already made for it with about 300 bills reported from com mittees during the special session. If any circumstances should prevent the receipt of the president's message on Monday, the probabilities are that the senate would adjourn over without taking up any other business until the message could be received. With the message read, it will remain for the senate to decide whether it shall enter seriously upon the work of the session after Monday or begin a system of delay intended to throw all important questions over beyond the Christmas holidays. The indica tions are now for a little more activity than usual during the pre-holiday ses sion. This is largely due to the fact that the supporters of the administra tion and advocates of annexation are very anxious to secure the earliest pos sible consideration of the treaty with Hawaii. Senator Davis, chairman of the committee on foreign relations, an nounced his purpose of pressing an nexation at the earliest possible mo ment, but it is probable that the mat ter will not be taken up seriously until the committee can have a meeting and decide upon details of procedure. The committee will be called together on Wednesday for htis purpose. One point which the committee will be called upon to decide is whether to proceed to ratify the treaty of annexation or to annex the islands by resolution. The annexationists have lost some votes during the vacation, and there is now apprehension that the two-thirds vote necessary to secure the ratification cannot be secured. No satisfactory canvass is possible until all the sena tors arrive, and, if it is then made manifest that the necessary two-thirds 

MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 6, 1897. vote cannot be secured, it is likely that the proceeding by means of resolution, which would require only a majority vote, will be inaugurated. Some mem bers of the foreign relations commit tee who favor annexation advocate this course, because they say they see no reason for traversing the same ground twice, as they would be com pelled to do in case the matter should be first considered in executive ses sion, fail there, and then be taken up in the form of a resolution in open senate and house. The immigration bill, for which Sen ator Lodge stands sponsor, is practi cally at the head of the senate legis lative calendar, and will be considered early in the session. Senator Lodge today repeated his intention of press ing the bill, but he will not antagonize the Hawaiian treaty with it. The first bill on the calendar is Senator Gear's measure providing for the adjustment of the Pacific railroad debt, but the sale of the Union Pacific doubtless will have the effect of causing the tempo rary withdrawal of this bill and the substitution of others. Of the 300 bills on the calendar, about 200 are private pension bills, and all of these probably will be disposed of at one sitting when taken up. There are also several hun dred recess appointments to bo consid ered in executive session. It is not probable that much will be done In the way of legislation during the present week. There will be .in ad journment for the day after receiving the message oh Monday, and as there is no disposition to press the Hawaiian matter until the foreign relations com mittee agrees upon a line of action the indications now are that it will not be taken up in the senate before next week. 

SHORT SESSION, SAYS CAXXON. \<> Financial Legislation Expected by the Banking? Committee. Special to the Globe. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.— "1 look for a short session of congress, and the transaction of considerable business," says Congressman Cannon, of Illinois, chairman of the committee on appro priations. "I believe that congress will adjourn not later than the first day of next June, and it is possible that we may get away from Washington by the middle cf May." "Will there be no national legisla-" tion?" "Of course there .will be. and some international legislation, too. In the first place, Hawaii will be annexed. You see in these later days the house of representatives does not spend all of its time in monkey business. Tom Reed has brought parliamentary prac tice down to a fine point. It is now conceded that the majority rule. The minority cannot spend time filibustering and doing all sorts of foolish things to thwart the will of the people. That being the case, and the determination having been reached that Hawaii shall be annexed, it will be done." "How about other legislation?" "Well, the committee on appropria tions will have all of the regular bills ready for action early in March, or sooner. In fact. I hope that some of the bills will be passed in January and February, and all of them will bp re ported to thp house without delay." "What will haj>pen in the mean time?" "The congressmen interested in war claims, private claims, private pen sion bills, and all sorts of odds and ends will have an opportunity to press their measures for consideration. Ev ery day will be busy. Out of our 356 members of the house of representa tives, not less than 300 men will be urging and begging consideration of their measurps. They will all be .'ifter the speaker for recognition, and I wiil be one of them. The congressmen who have public building bills on hand will , also be clamoring- for a chance. Every day will be day time, and there will be no night during the session." Congressman Joseph H. Walker, of Massachusetts, chairman of the com mittee on banking and currency, says: "There will be no financial legislation. It has been determined by tho author and finisher of our careers in the house of representatives that the house of representatives shall not be organized 'to do business,' as Tom Reed used to put it. On the contrary, the man who once stood before the people as the biggest man in legislative life is now showing us how not to do business. Your friend Cannon is right when he says that we will do practically noth ing but pass the approDriation bills. He Is also right about Hawaiian an nexation. That will probably occur before the Christmas holidays." "But Mr. Cannon said there would be other business." "Yes, he says so. but he knows that nothing but the bankruptcy bill will have right of way. All cf the little bills \\;hich congressmen may urge will not amount to shucks. The house will meet from day to day. and adjourn without accomplishing much. It is a decree, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, that the congress shall not do business." "Will there be a caucus of Republi cans in the house of representatives?" "It is quite likely that there will be. There is no necessity for a caucus. The same power which controls the house would control the caucus. Nev ertheless, it might be good policy and good politics to have a caucus, in or der to shift the responsibility onto the entire party. That is a very old po litical trick. When a man has the pow er to control affairs, and does so. peo ple call him a boss. If he has a cau cus which authorizes him to do his will, then he cannot be called a boss, because he is ostensibly carrying out the will of his party. Oh, yes, I pre sume there will be a caucus, and the caucus will decide that no business shall be done." JOHN' W. GRIGGS, WHO IS TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL. fITTORNEY GENERfIL 8 Nom i nation °V he Q New f sey Governor to Succeed uRIGuS. g McKenna Announced. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.— lt was offi cially announced at the White house today upon the return of the president to Washington, that Gov. John Griggs, of New Jersey, has been tendered and has accepted the office of attorney general of the United States, which will be vacated by the nomination of Attorney General McKenna to be as sociate justice of the Udited States supreme court. It has not yet been settled when Gov. Griggs Bhall assume his new office, but it is probable that the date will be about the beginning of the new year. Gov. John W. Griggs, of New Jersey, who has accepted the tender of the portfolio of at torney general, to succeed Judge McKenna. is one of the foremost Republicans in the state of which he is the chia( executive. Gov. Griggs is in that period of life which confers maturity without involving any possible weakness from old age. He is nearing 50, and h»s all the ripeness of judgment and expe rience that comes with that time of life. He is a native of the state over which he presides, and his family conßributed many good soldiers to the array of independence. He entered the Lafayette college in 1564, and 

ITALIAN niNISTRY RESIGNS. LONDON, Dec. s.— The Rome cor respondent of the Morning Post says: "The cabinet has resigned. Gen. Pel lieux's action is regarded as a political move to make it possible for the Mar quis di Rudini to secure a unanimous ministry. The ministers of finance, justice and public works in the retir ing cabinet will not appear in its suc cessor." ROME, Dec. s.— Gen. Pellieux, min ister of war, maintained the attitude he had taken up in consequence of the action of parliament in amending the bill dealing with army promotions against his advice and persisted in his PICTURES SENT OVER A TELEGRAPH WIRE.

A few months in the legislature served to dem onstrate to his fellow Republicans the fact that he was a genuine leader, and he soon took his place in that capacity. Seven years later he succeeded the present vice preside.X of the United States, Garret A. Hobart, es state senator, and in 1886 he was president of the New Jersey senate. Meanwhile he was enlarging his law practice and perfecting him self in those studies allied to his profession. He has been a delegate to a national Repub lican convention, and he won the friendship of the vice president, to whose good offices, tt is said, the tender of the portfolio of attorney general Is due. Defects in Revenue Laws. 

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Dec. s.— The United States grand jury, just prior to its final ad journment yesterday, rendered its opinion. United States commissioners were severely censured for allowing defendants in many cases to give "straw bonds," accepting as sureties "persons whose irresponsibility is notorious." The cases referred to were those involving illicit distilling. Judge Boarman. in replying, said be had recently consulted with the attorney general and several con gressmen with a view to remedying the de fects in the revenue laws.

After the machine is connected with the electric circuit, and the platinum point is set in motion, each time it en counters the strip of shellac the circuit is broken for a moment perhaps, or for a few seconds, as the case may be. This break in the circuit throws down against the receiving paper in the com plementary part of the machine a sharp needle point, which etches into the surface a line corresponding to the course taken by the platinum point while on the shellac insulation. When the platinum point has pa?sed over the shellac, and the circuit is again closed,
