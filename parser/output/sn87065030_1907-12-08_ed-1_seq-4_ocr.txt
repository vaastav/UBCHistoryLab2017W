Governor Vat daman will soon be gin work upon his farewell message to the legislature', v. nd it is said that among the rt commendations embod ied therein wiil be one urging that a liberal appropriation be made for improvement. s at the Industrial In stitute and College. The governor has always been a staunch friend of the institution, and realizing the' splendid work that is beiriu; accom plished there, does not like to see the school handicapped by lack of funds. The work accomplished at the col lege has been so notably successful j that the institution has been steadily j gaining friends for sevral years, a number of the senators and repre sentatives who formerly fought ade quate appropriation having now de clared themselves to be in favor of giving money sufficient to meet ev ery legitimate demand. Among those who formerly worked against liberal appropriations was Capt. Frank P.urkitt. an influential mem ber of the lower house from Chick asaw county, but when Captain Burk itt recently came here as a member of the committee appointed to ap praise the college property and saw for himself how well the young wo men who are students there are be- ing trained he lost all animosity to ward the institution and ass 'red President Whitfield that when the appropriation bill came up lie would not only vote for the measure but would give it his support in the house and vigorously urge its pas- President Whitfield is verv n n v-1 ions to secure a library and a gym nasium for the college, and in ad dition to these buildings there is ur- ! gent need for extended repairs on the dormitories. music hall and:"""-' v v ov ii,CI 1 1 v , chapel. Very little repair work has "been done on these buildings since ' ,herr -erection, and that their walls' !- and i their roofs leaky is perfectly natural. The executive- committee of the hoard ot trustees at a recnt meeting adopted a resolution providing for an estimate on the work needed to put the buildings in thorough re pair, and President Whitfield will in- r.ornornte this estitnnto in Vita l-.ic.-n report to the? legislature, and ironrlation auffi-! "will ask for an hnpropr cient not only to cover the repairs!41 but to provide for the erection of gymnasium and a library. 

DESERVES LIBERAL SUPPORT. President H. L. Whitfield, of the Industrial Institute and College, has a card elsewhere in this paper, call ing the attention of the people to the high class attractions which are to appear there this season and so liciting their co-operation and sup port in the effort which he is mak ing to bring to Ihe city the greatest artists of the world. These celebri ties can only be secured by the pay ment of liber! guarantees, and if they are to continue to appear here Columbians must patronize the en tertainments more liberally in the future than they have done in the past. The coming of Paderewski, Nordica. Sernbrieh and other musi cians of world-wide fame has not only brought pleasure to our people but has advertised the city abroad and Columbus is beginning to be re garded as one of the most important musical center:, iu the South. But if this reputation is to be main tained we must all give President Whitfield our support, and not only attend the entertainments ourselves but urge our friends to witness them. David Bispham. the world's great est baritone, appears at the college chapel December 16, and it is to be hoped that his recital will be lis tened to by an audience that will crowd the chaje! to its very doors. Mr. Bispham is aa artist of interna tional reputation, and in addition to the pleasure to tie derived from hear- i ins him sing, the people who attend can feel that they are helping along a great movement which is import ant to Columbus as well as to the college. Columbians are pardon ably proud of the Industrial Insti tute and College, and they should evince their love for the institution by liberally supporting every move ment which is undertaken in its be half and which depends upon their patronage for success. A 

BANK TO BRAG ON. The people of Columbus have just cause to be proud of the. First State Bank, which during the pending 1 panic has proven its ability to take care of both its depositors and stock holders. In the strenuous financial life which the past few months have witnessed, the First State Bank has distanced all competitors in liberal ity toward its customers, having been one of the few banks in the country to place no restrictions whatever around the withdrawal of deposits. While most banks were content to sit idly by and hoard what money i they had on hand, this course did ! not appeal to those in authority at tin- First State Bank. The bank had sufficient funds on hand to meet . terian church. The obsequies were the demands of depositors having j attended by a large concourse of sor balances therein, but this was not j rowing relatives and friends, and the enough. The bank wanted to see cotton in this section move with its accustomed promptness and alac rity, and in order to secure curreney to pay the checks of the brokers Captain Johnston, the president, made a special trip to New York. He succeeded in perfecting arrange ments whereby the bank could ob tain all the money necessary, and the brokers doing business with the bank are now buying bale after bale of cotton each day. The people of Columbus owe Cap- tain Johnston, the president, and Mr. Williams, the cashier, a debt of gratitude for having pursued such a liberal policy. The arrangement ef fected by the bank has put in circu lation here thousands of dollars which would have otherwise re mained locked in the vaults of the big financial institutions of the East, and our merchants are selling goods which they very much feared would remain on their shelves until an- ; other season. Nothing helps a com ' munity more than to have a liberal I bank, and the officials of the First : State Dank know how to be liberal and progressive without overstep- ping the bounds of conservatism. ! A 

DOGMATIC DOCUMENT. j That Roosevelt's popularity is on , I the wane is evinced by the indiffer- 1 ence with which his recent message ! i congress was received. Time was j j when a president's message was I ! looked upon wtih almost reverential respect . and congress spent days in? ' dissecting, assimilating ad consider ; ing its various clauses. The Roose I volt propaganda, however, received no such respectful consideration. ; Many representatives left the house before the reading of the document been concluded, nd those who tJOliit U I 1111(1 VilU I I II IlitT r I UH. so with llJlll,uue wi in- Li ii w 1 1 u eiiuicii- fortitude " ... i . f .v .. . i i . goer or else pre-empted the right of the recalcitrant communicant and went to sleep. The president's message may be properly classed as a dogmatic docu ment. Instead of making sugges tions for the correction of existing evils he outlines the policies that be wants pursued and commands that j the' be Put ilUo effect' The lips of i j;eueiuus wim; woman who is i her kisses soon become insipid, and i !the official who becomes verbosely' f 2 . a 1 ! . .

The measures advocated by Roosevelt are far too drastic to meet the views of conservative peo ple, and his following is made up of a small cortege of hungry politicians i who have received nourishment at the political pie counter. Both houses of congress are made up of brainy, well-informed men, who think for themselves, and it is easy to see that they have no inten tion of allowing the president to ex ercise undue control over their ac tions. They were elected by the peo ple, and will adopt such measures and enact such laws as in their judgment will best subserve the interests of their constituents. Mrs. Louise Waring Lee Dead. All Columbus mourns the death of Mrs. Louise Waring Lee, which oc curred at her home. No. 1103 Main street, at 10:20 o'clock last Thurs day night, and which resulted from organic heart trouble. Although Mrs. Leigh had not been in robust health for some time past, her condi tion was considered by no means ser ious up to last Thursday evening, when she was seized with a spell of heart failure, and never recuperated from the attack, having, grown grad ually worse until the end came." Deceased, who at the time of her death was fifty-one years of age, was the beloved wife of Mr. H.:" Lee, the efficient cashier of the Columbus Insurance and Banking Company, and was a lady whose many noble qualities commanded the respect and admiration of all who had the pleas ure of her acquaintance. She was a devoted wife, a kind and affection ate parent and a loyal friend, and many hearts are weighted with un speakable sorrow on account of her death. Besides her husband, Mrs. Lee is survived by a daughter, Mrs. William D. Sanders; a sister, Miss Lizzie War ing, and three brothers, Messrs. Will Ed. and Lawrence Waring. All of the surviving relatives mentioned above live in or near Columbus, ex- cept Mr. Lawrence Waring, who is a resident of Decatur, 111., but who came to Columbus as soon as he was notified of his sister's death and who was present at the obsequies. The Dispatch joins the numerous friends of the family in extending sympathy and condolence in the great sorrow which they have been called upon to face. The funeral took place at the fam ily residence at 10:30 o'clock Satur day morning, having been conducted by Rev. Wr. E. Dakin, recior of St. Paul's Episcopal church, and Rev. J. J. Hill, pastor of the First Presby- floral offerings were both numerous and beautiful. The interment was at Friendship cemetery, Capt. William Winston, Messrs. E. R. Sher man, Gid D. Harris, C. C. Birder, B. Hopkins, W. L. Gardner, T. B. Franklin and M. A. Franklin having officiated as pall bearers. Mr. David Bispham, College Chapel, Monday Night, December 1G. Mr. David Bispham, pre-eminent in both the old and new world for j his highly finished and many-sided j art, and frequently, but erroneously, regarded, because of some years of residence in Londan, as an English man, is a native of Philadelphia (he was born January 5, 1857), a de scendant of the Quaker, Joshua Bispham, who emigrated from Lan cashire, Eng., late in the sevnteenth century and joined William Penn in his Pennsylvania colony. His early education was received at a cell t MR. 

DAVID BISPHAM ! brated Friends' school, and later he j took the full course at Haverford j College, the principal institution of I the Quaker sect, graduating in the i class of 1S7S. He always took an ; active interest in athletics, and con : siders that he owes his powerful j physique and robust health to that j early inclination dear to his soul, j So constantly has he been occupied each summer in London and each winter in New York with his operatic i engagements, that it would seem im possible that Mr. Bispham could have found time and strength to per fect himself in other branches of his art, but his standing as an oratorio singer and interpreter of all the high est song forms proves that it is a fait accompli, and that nothing seems to be impossible to the worker with brains and temperament. "Mr. Bispham feels that what he has acomplished is due wholly to his inestimable power of applying him self heart and soul to a lofty ideal, and never thinking or caring how hard a task is or that there is no end to the striving. He also con siders that vocal art is not only ap plicable to singing, but strongly ad vocates the cultivation and use of the speaking voice and of the Eng lish language in its greatest purity. Many great singers have appeared here during recent years, but none excel David Bispham, who appears at the college chapel Monday night, December 16. Tickets for David Bispham's re cital $1.50 and $2.00, on sale at Mayo & Weaver's drug store. Two Runaway Marriage. Two runaway couples were mar ried at the court house last week, J. L. Pennington and Miss Annie Pen nington, of Vernon, having been joined together in the holy bonds of wedlock Wednesday, and Mr. John S. Murphy and Miss Lilliam Brown, of Gordo, having been married on the following day. Both ceremonies were performed by Justice of the Peace F. W. Flood. r , . feh- '- 1 -Q . ',r; '?, - -r. .

TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT To the Editor of The Dispatch: For the last two years the college has endeavored to furnish its stu dents and the people of Columbus and Its vicinity the best obtainable entertainments. The artists that have appeared during this time are ! the best that he world affords. I Columbus enjoys the distinction of I being the only town in Mississippi where so distinguished talent has appeared, and I am sure that all loy al citzens feel a just pride in this fact and realize that their people not only have the opportunity of enjoy ing literary and musical advantages beyond any other town in the South, i but that it gives our beautiful little city a very marked prestige, f Artists of this class can be ob ' tained only at a great cost, at too great a cost for either the college , alone or the town alone to sustain. So if these high class entertainments I are to remain as a permanent feature ! of the life of the community, it is i necessary that the college have the ! hearty co-operation of the people of Columbus in maintaining them. Surely the people of Columbus desire the very best for their children in the way of the highest standard of art; nothing is so conducive to the culture of a town as to have those who stand at the very head of the artistic professions to appear before the people year after year. I have made contracts with a num- , ber of these world-wide artists the t best that could be procured, without j reference to cost. The list has been submitted to experts in this line, in j whom I have absolute confidence, 1 and their opinion is that no city in the South has ever had an equal ! number of so distinguished musi- i j cians to appear in any one season as we will have during the present win i ter and spring. ! Tf T nm nnt neta inH h- t Inn nno. pie, it will be impossible to provide these entertainments for the next i year, l. ieei sure mat our people ao not want us to take a backward step. Your pristine pride will rebel at the idea of failure in an enterprise which j adds so much to the better life of the community. The college wants to continue the closest relations with the people of Columbus" in every respect, and we think it but fair that the people, es pecially in thos-e things that mean so much for the town, heartly co-operate with the college. I shall reduce the price of the next entertainment, and I hope the good people of the city of Columbus will give us that patronage which will justify the continuance of these high class entertainments. Respectfully, H. L. Whitfield, President. For Councilman lor Ward Two II. J. Dashiell. There is a demand for the public service at this time for men of af fairs, men who have property inter ests, family interests and perforce the public interest. Such a man is Mr. Harry J. Dashiell. This is his native vity; all of his life has been spent here; his home, his family, his all are here, so, hav ing been but little in the public ser vice the public now have a right to that service. As a councilman he will work for economy, for a strict conformity to the law, maintenance of our schools up to the highest efficiency, mainten ance of the streets, fire department, water, lights and all public necessi ties up to the needs of our growing city. He is hereby placed before the people for election without asking his permission. Such a man is needed in the public service, such a man can not afford to decline. Now, then, Harry J. Dashiell for councilman from Ward 2. Coimuu n icat vtl. There is a need of much thought and a careful consideration of the man to succeed Mr. J. H. Stevens as alderman from Ward 2. In elect ing a man to succeed Mr. Stevens to represent their interests, the citizens of Columbus should select a man who has the welfare of the city and her people at heart, a man who is a city property owner and a man in every way thoroughly identified with the business world of the city. As a citizen of Columbus and a property holder, I would suggest Mr. Suiion Loeb as Mr. J. H. Stevens' suc cessor. He is a man who needs no introduction to the people of Colum bus as he has been a well known fig ure in the business world here since 1S6. He has been with her,in her growth from a small town to one of the most prosperous cities in the State and there can be no better qualified man to guard her interests. Mr. Loeb is admirably qualified and would make a strong addition to the ranks of our City Fathers. I hope Summary of the 

CORPORATION'S. He reiterates formerly expressed views on the control of corporations with the provision that there should be an extension not of federal authority, but of federal activity. He believes that there should be a national incorporation act or a law licensing railroads so framed as to give the commerce commission power to pass on future issue of securities or make physical valuation of any railroad. He recommends a supervision of interstate corporations analagous to that exercised over national banks, with compulsory publication of accounts and subjection of books and papers to government inspection. He recommends that there should be a 'commission to pass on all char ter applications, to prevent over-capitalization and to prevent monopolies from engaging in interstate trade. ciiu: i:cy. He attributes in a great measure the present financial stringency to reckless speculation, but believes that there should be an elastic, safe and secure currency and that the currency laws need reform. He is favorable to former Secretary Shaw's plan for an emergency cur rency based on adequate securities and taxed so high that it will be driven back when not needed in legitimate trade. He thinks trust companies should be submitted to the same supervision as national banks. 1 X LA X D W A T I : I i VA Y S . He is very strong in his recommendations concerning improvements of inland rivers, and has this to say: "From the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi there should be a deep waterway, with deep waterways leading from it to the East and the West. Such a waterway would practically mean the extension of our coast line into the very, heart of our country. It would be of incalculable benefit to our people. If begun at once it can be carried through in time appreci ably to relieve the congestion of our great freight-carrying lines of railroads. The work should be systematically and continuously carried forward In ac cordance with some well-conceived plan. The main streams should be im proved to the highest point of efficiency before the improvement of the branches is attempted; and the work should be kept free from every taint of recklessness or jobbery." 

TARIFF. He is firm in his belief in the principle of protective tariff, but realizes that the schedules should be revised to meet changing business conditions every few years, such revision to be made upon a cautious and business-like basis. He has become converted to the principle of a graduated income tax so devised that it will be constitutional, but prefers an inheritance tax as a better means of making big fortunes bear their expenses of government. He favors the German plan of 2T per cent tax on inheritances when passed to distant relatives with estates under $5,000 exempt from taxation. ENFORCEMENT OF CORPORATION LAWS. He is satisfied with the manner in which the Department of Justice has proceeded against the big corporations, but believes that the best means of stopping corporate dishonesty is in sending the wealthy offenders to Jail and not imposing fines on the corporations. LABOR AND CAPITAL. He advises some effort on the part of congress to prevent the abuse of injunctions, but leaves the injunction issue, as It affects federal and State control of railroads, to the adjudication of the supreme court. He favors, as a protection to railroad employes, a federal Inspector sim ilar to that of steamboat inspector, who shall investigate all railroad acci dents. Damages to employes should be paid automatically, and not through the courts. He believes that the eight-hour day should be extended as rapidly as possible to all government work, and that compulsory investigation of labor troubles should be decided upon. He takes a firm stand against woman and child labor. IRRIGATION AND LANDS. He advocates the extension of the irrigation and reclamation work and j the protection of the public lauds by the prevention of illegal fencing. i He blames the supine public opinion for the exhaustion of the forests, He believes that the duty on wood pulp should be abolished. THE ARMY. . He declares that there is no danger in militarism, and that the only dan- ger is in the smallness of our regular army. I He announces that army officers should be made to stand a physical test or be weeded out. THE NAVY. He affirms that The Hague conference has shown there is no need of hoping for peace through the limitation of armaments, and that at least four battleships a year should be constructed. He believes the coast towns should be fortified and the navy made an offensive and not a defensive organization. THE IljkGUH CONFERENCE. He announces that The Hague conference did not go as far as he antici pated, but that the establishment of an international prize court, the preven tion of debt collection by force and the advance made on the principle of obligatory arbitration justified the purpose of the meeting. MISCE LLA X KOUS. He recommends a postal savings bank and the extension of the parcels post. He believes that local self-government should be granted Alaska, and that citizenship should be conferred on Porto Rico. He recommends a national monument in Vicksburg National Park and the maintenance of the Hermitage by the government. He believes in the publication of campaign contributions and the pro hibition of big corporate contributions to national campaigns. He advocates an improvement in the ocean mail service. he will announce himself as a candi date for alderman from Ward 2. " Old Citizen." Card of Thanks. Mr. Editor Please allow the Palmer Orphanage space in your col umns to return thanks, yes, heart fel thanks, to Brother Dakin and his flock, to the young ladies of the I. I. and C, and to others of the city too numerous to mention, for their kind, generous and substantial re membrances of us on Thanksgiving Day.

December 7, 1907. Clara Bloodgood a Suicide. Local theatergoers were shocked to learn last Friday that Clara Blood good, who only a few weeks ago had appeared at the Columbus Theater in Clyde Fitch's comedy, "The Truth," had on the previous day committed suicide in a Baltimore hotel. The following excerpt from a Baltimore special bearing date of December 5 gives a succinct account of the trag edy : Miss Clara Bloodgood, the noted actress, and wife of William Laini ber, member of the New York Stock Exchange, committed suicide this evening in the Hotel Stafford, by firing a bullet into her brain. The woman fired three shots. She placed a revolver in her mouth, probably for the third shot, and the bullet ploughed through the roof of the mouth and lodged In her brain. . President's Message. Another bullet was found embedded in the ceiling. Where the third shot lodged is not known. Friends of the actress can assign no motive for her self-destruction, but it is said tonight that Miss Blood -good had $15,000 in the Knicker bocker Trust Company iu New York and could not draw a cent from her account. Miss Blood good's married life is declared to have been admir ably peaceful and happy and she had no reverses in her stage career. Mr. Lincoln a Candidate. As will be seen from the announce ment columns of this paper, Mr. B. A. Lincoln is a candidate for the posi tion on the city council vacated by Hr. J. H. Stevens at the election which is to be held this month.
