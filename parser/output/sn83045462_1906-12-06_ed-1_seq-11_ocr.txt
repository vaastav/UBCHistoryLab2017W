PASTURE LAND BIDS THEIB OPENING POSTPONED ON ACCOUNT OF BAINS. Secretary of the Interior Httchrock today Issued an order postponing .'ion the 10th Instant to the 17th instant the opening of soaled bids for the pasture and weed reserve lands In the Kiewa, Comanche and f Ar>o^.h? TnilLtn reservations in Oklahoma, j 1 The Secretary's notion was taken because ' h?\ivy rains and high waters in the streams j have delayed the mails and have rendered j It impossible for prospective bidders to examine the lands. Secretary Hitchcock received a telegram from representatives of the Interior Department at I.awton, Okla., informing him that the railroads had been damaged seriously by re?-ent rains and floods and that many bids for the lands consequently would be delayed beyond the 10th instant. 11 ? *--* 1 rn that ATllv 11 Wa> BlULtm 111 incr indium j trtelv bids had been received up to noon yesterday. The Secretary authorized the following telegram to be sent immediately to J. \V. Wit ten. register and receiver of the land office at I .a w t on: "Time for receiving pasture land bids this day extended for one week, including Saturday, December 13. and the opening of the bids postponed until Monday, December 17." The regulations for the reception of bids were so modified as to validate checks and drafts made payable to the register of the land office at I.awton. The lands to be sold comprise about 43<>,(**> acr?s, exclusive of the Indian allotments They are to be sold for not less tt>an |5 an acre. JAPAN TN THE MESSAGE EDITORIAL COMMENTS ON THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION. From the New Tork Herald. There Is not much likelihood that Americans will indorse President Roosevelt's startling views regarding the Japanese. For this reason his amazing message to Congress will certainly prove a boomerang and hurt him more than the citizens It Is aimed at. It is the importance of the issue at stake 4 th:?t iri;ilce? h(? nnthre-ik oarticiilnrlv re grettable. Japan would make a huge mistake were It to imagine that the President In Ills last message voices American public opinion. In this particular case he speaks solely for himself. The Japanese Question. From the New Orleans Times-Democrat. The more one considers the matter the more he is convinced that there Is only one thing for the President to do In respect to the Japanese demand for admission to the California white schools. That is to uphold tlx: right of the people of that state to separate the different races as much as they wish, always with the proviso that equal educational privileges are irlven to all. i For Export. From the New York Times. William McKlnley, we think, would have phrased differently the message of solace for Japan and of admonition for San Francisco which President Roosevelt Included in his annual discourse to Congress upon the affairs of the nation. Nevertheless, we hope the people of San Francisco will not permit their susceptibilities to be unduly ruflled by anything Mr. Roosevelt has said, or by the way in which he has said it. If the pas sage in question had been plainiy labeled "for export." Sin Francisco would have understood It better. Country Must Abide by Its Treaties. From the Philadelphia Inquirer. ] * Whatever may be uncertain and perplex- j InK in connection with this Japanese quo!?tlon which has suddenly become so pro.mi- I nent s^ine things are clear. It Is clear, J for instance, that under all circumstances, i In spite of all difficulties and without re- i i gard to consequences, this country i3 in honor and in duty bound to fulfill its treaty obligations. The Japanese Pother. From the Philadelphia Ledger. The trust sensible word spoken relative. to the exclusion of Japanese men andchil-' dren from the San Francisco white schools is the <-a!m. dignified statement issued by Viscount Aoki. the Japanese minister to 'Washltkgton. "There is-no agitation in Japan, there is no fe. ling agylnst the l.'ni;?d States among our people. It Is all in San Francisco and In Europe and in the newspapers. Our people are fully advised of the facts. Wc are willing to leave everything to your President and vour K. renrv nt nnit your courts." It may lie questioned whether his confidence In th>- JudKmen: of our Impetuous ?ri?l Imperii us President, who seems to essay the ro!e rf :i sovereign ruler in a country not accustomed to tlio restraints and guidance provided by courts and constitutions, ii.is not been misplaced. Ni.tiling can !? more ill advised and more calculated to stir up needless strife and contention than the President's references In his \ message to the Japanese question.
