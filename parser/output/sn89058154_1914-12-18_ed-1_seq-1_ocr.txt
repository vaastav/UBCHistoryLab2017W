1 Where We Are At ,, President Wilson in his annual message to congress, seems to realize that he has gone to the limit in legislation affecting big business. He practically says legislation along such lines has brought to a standstill the big business enterprises of the coun try and nothing more will be done, unless they are able to sur vive the shock he has given them. Jtl the legislation was had .under the direct orders of the president to congress. The recent election somewhat opened his eyes. The stagnation of bus iness along industrial and trans portation lines is the direct result of drastic legislation. No one was able to know when they put their money into any railroad or other corporation whether they were getting into the toils of the criminal law or- not. Hence they have held aloof, and we now find the railroads unable to get money tn improve their properties, and many have or will go into the hands of receivers. Already they have advanced the freight rates, and . the commissioners permit the same because the business does not show a profit sufficient to keep up incidental expenses. Because of the stagnation in the manufacturing business brought about by the reduction of the tariff and the laws against com binations of capital, the business of the ; railroads are seriously lessened. i - The demands on us from the warring world, should increase all the productive industries of the country, which ' may save a general collapse of business. Under normal conditions . the whole fabric of American busi ness would be bankrupt. Had no drastic legislation been enact ed, . this government would be enjoying a state of prosperity unknown heretofore. With the world wanting what we have at our own pi ice, save and except cotton, we should be in a golden age. ..When capital is crippled the poor go hungry and the labor ing man hunts the soud house. as county superintendent during the past two years.

The Gravelhill Road Improvement Society, at a meeting attended by about fifty of our ' leading citizens, unanimously adopted a resolution to ask the Quarterly Court at its session First Monday in January, to call for an election to vote on the issuance of $25,000 for the purpose of grading and culverting all principal roads in McNairy county. - ' , There are between 300 and 350 miles of public roads in the county, and any public road is, proportionate ly, as important as another, and each community has as much right to im provements as the other. It will be remembered that in De cember, 1913, the people of Gravel hill decided that they could hardly afford to put up longer with the con ditions of our roads, since they were almost impassable, so they met and organized themselves and decided to grade the main public road from Sel mer to the state line near Corinth, Miss., since this road was of prime importance in marketing our crops The good people of both Selmer and Corinth lent a helping hand and with our own private means and work the road 15 miles distant is nearly com plete. We found that from $35 to $50 per mile will grade our roads by contract. 300 miles at $50 would cost $15,000, but culverts and some levee work, ditches, etc., would ag gregate some expense, together with dynamite. We had at our meeting recently, magistrates, road commissioners and 1 trge land owners and all are unan imously in favor of taking the matter up at once, since by so doing the work of grading, if done, can be done Prints the Best and Most Complete Reporte of the Legislative Proceedings Special Offer Remit one dollar for The Daily Banner four months by mail, one extra month free if you cut out this adver tisement and return it with your remittance.

Why the Youth's Companion Should be in Every Family "If I could take only one paper", said the late Mr. Justice Brewer of the Supreme Court, "it would be the Youth's Companion a little of every thing in a nutshell, and unbiased." The Companion is a family paper in the completest sense. ' It provides reading that, without failing to inter est thj young, stiil interests the ma ture. It unites young and old through their common enjoyment of delightful fiction, agreeable rtiiacellany, and the clear exposition of public questions. So carefully is it edited, so varied are its contents, that it would easily supply a family with "entertaining fiction, up-to-date information an 1 wholesome fun, if no other periodical entered the house. .
