POLITICAL PARTIES. When the present Administration c.une into power, neither the lteiublican nor Poiiiocmtio parly was fully and imiini immsly agreeil us to their respective poli cies. There were radical nnd conservative Republicans opposed by Breckinridge and liouglas Democrats. But the incidents of the rebellion have -wrought great cha iges in Northern parlies. When the first news of the I bardment of Fort Slimier I an with lightning speed throughout tho coun try, old party lines instantly vanished, nud the great majority of the North rallied as one man in response to the call ot the Gov ernment for troops. True, then' were those in the North who sympathized with and wished the reoels success ; but for the tin:e they were practically subdued by the up rising of the loyal masses. Tho course of events, however, has changed the political current. While loyal ncn tilled our armies, the "sympathizers" remained at home, and disloyal leadcis, by taking advantage of defeats and delays, nud misrepresenting nnd censuring the Government, when it was compelled to deal harshly wi'.h those seeking its over throw, have rallied a powerful political combination, ami at the present stale ol affairs there live two earucsUy unite I par tie in the North the or.e thoroughly sup porting the Government in every effort to rrusli lie' rein llion. even lit the sacrifice ol slavery, and evincing a determination to piosccute the war just as long as tnei e is u rebel squa 1 o resist; the other sympa thising w ith the rebels, desirous of e.uii promising with nnd yielding eipial lights to those who have been the means of distract ing the country nnd hen ling wailing lo many thousands of once happy homes. In some localities, however, where the Democrats me to weak too seriously think of obtaining the local otliccs without a sisuuco, there is a pai n yovcssi'i; to dif fer with both the foregoing - a parly which eiiginally huiuchoj out on tho political sea with the intention, of taking the "Southern brother by the band, and saying we, too. have boon to blame." This " commend.- bio " enterprise having failed, most of those cupped in it li.ivo rotunici to their tonner j.olit'cul $ltu, tin I now enrnostly inlvocnte uithcr tho coinidcto buop es .ion of the I e - bullion, or eimipioiiiise w ilh traitors, and their restoration to all tho l ights and privi leges f ;ood eiti;:cMH. There ere K.une exceptions t- this, however Mime papers ttud their BUpportors till clln-in,; to the ' coimei vativc " idea, ill tho hope tiiat lliey .may thereby yit be enahlo.l to tide into ijiower. Tiiis e!as ef journals, while imhlly -deuouueiuf; Yall.iu liUam, speak even more Jiarshly of KepuMienti leadwin who lire IxLown to be fudy alive in their clh.tU to crush lic.iKonj while a.iyiu, "Down with Ynllandih mis," lliey arc mill in the "pay ;uid i iu tucrsflip " nf tlnihii who r-yinp.ilh e wilh utid follow the political fortunes of thut notorious Northern rebel. Democratic jiapcrs stale that Ihe policy id their party is to " ivrrv lif i;;7.n'io'i f the cv usr inj 7;7M?..'MM t'oioccxs," yet these " con tcrvntive" journals nay that Democrats w ill not oppose a'.y iiK.is iie for cnishii'K the rebellion. " tiive u uo Vulland lhaius, but the l uloii cannot bo saved nud the war ended, unless unconditional I'nion toen unite w ilh Democrats, take their Southern brethren by the hand, confess that the North has been to blame, itud restore bait ors to tho rights of loyal men." Such is tho present tone of some jmtrn ds v hii pro.'cus to he wholly for the ivstoiaUm ol' the Union aid iuiotuaton it tuc rbov We know that thia com so ph ascn the flicmU ut Vall-itidi-ham let cueh of oiu rcJtra decide whether it pleases the ear nest friends of the- redent Admit. iM.-utioti, and whether it in a couihe ilicltttcJ hy pa Uiotiatt vr dash fot vliicv. 

POLITICAL PARTIES. GHOULS OF THE PRESS. Fu:no limu 'sine noted I'nion man in Missouri Was ea)lm e l by n bund a of the iinineroits guerrilla marandeiK intent, tig tlnt State, snd General McNeil, n Federal ofliocr, f;av liotico that if the ruptured man was not returned tn a Riven time, be would shoot ton guerrilla bandits. The I'nion nun was not returned, and the ten ptuiril his were shot. At this "many of tho BoreHsioti-syrnpathi.-ing journals of the North arc setting tip a bowl of indignation, branding; General Me Neil as a " murderer," nnd etuitn that he has, by this just retributive art, disraeed the Federal arms. This uet has likewise railed forth the indignation of tho hicIi traitor Jc If. P.ivis, and he swears terrible vengeance. It is met. theiefore, that those papers which condemn ami denounce every loyal luensuro taken for tho suppres sion of tho rebellion, should likewise howl, when S.'eessia is meeting the just recom penso of itj;rcnt national crime. The facts are that Iho ten guerrillas nhot were raptured sonic time in tho Huuituer. nnd wine discharged on their piirolo of honor not to take up urius against the I'ni toil States authorities until exchanged They were afterward raptured with nrnis in thrir b inds, fighting the I'nioii troops and for this violation of their parole do served the punishment of death, nr-cording to the rides of war. " McNeil has disgraced tho Federal nrni't ! " Huoli in the cry of these lion's of the press. I'retty Hpecimens, indeed, to upeak of disgrace ! Ji lTf. P.kviw, tho bitter enemy of our Government, who has eon spired ujrainst it, and is seeking by every means within his power to destroy it, do iii.vnls lln surrender to him of McNeil, iiii'l wo have those among lis so lost to every principle of patriotism. honor and manhood who nay that "tho Administration will per form a just and righteous net by delivering up McNeil to Jell', llavis-- to be disposed ol as tho latter may determine ! " To add fur ther to their depravity, they assert tho lie that bysodoing Iho Admiiiiatrntioii "Would gratify the public wish in tho mutter I Was ever lie re ii lie more monstrous? Such i:i indeed the wish of the enemies of our Hepublic but not tho wish of the loya millions to be found within her limits It is not (lingular tit all that these jour uahi and these men should seize upon every n't committed y loyal men that results in ,,;,.,,., ,,, I",.ljl, ttll, tr,.iwn. It is only in keeping with their principles. In their professions of loyally --and they ur only pi on Hsi ius lliey have no won! condemnation for any of Iho lea Ins of the rebellion men who have ruthlessly tiam pled upon the Constitution who are now with demoniac zeal attempting the ruin of our liberties in whoso wake nothing lias followed but blood, rapine, ruin -men lost lo every principle and feeling id' Immunity not a word of condemnation for these M ini -devils in human shape. The pirate Alabama roams tin seas in her career of murder nnd robbery. No word of condemnation from these sclf-conutitulcd judges of justice and crime. John Morgan, the !an 1 pirate, whose deeds far eclipse those of John A. Mitrrill. iu still unhung. No word id' condemnation for his m is of murder ami barbarity. Many of the loyal men of K ist Tennessee have been dragged from their homes, robbed of their propel ly, their wives and daugh tcis violated, and tlicmsclvv hung for their devotion to the 1'uion, by (hu hunjin fiends and blind devotees of secession. No word against these acts. f' very atrocity thut the brain nnd heart of a li 'iid can dictate atrocities unpalal lelled iu the luslory of tho. world, iu any age or nation, have been peipnt rated by our 'Southern brethren" atrocities, the bare mention of which will curdle the blood, hi inch the cheek, and make the heart stand still with horror. Vet no wold of condemnation from such journals as me ever ready to condemn and censure the acts nud proceedings of the true nn 1 loyal men of the country! Out upon such recreants let their names descend to the inl.iiuy their iniquitous course so richly incrils. THE "DIVINITY" OF SLAVERY. If the emancipation Proclamation of President l.'iicoln was to icsult in no prac tical Ijcrrlit toour country, it at least would materially niii Iho cause of Immunity, by being the ne ans of exploding ,'ho slaveholders' doctrine of the "divinity" ol j slavery. The friends of the " peculiar in- miration luive scarcely ever entered into a controversy concerning its merits, with out asserting that tho relation of master nud slase, like that of parent and child, was sanctioned by Divine Power; that both would nl.ke endure to the end of time, and weru e.pudiy binding and agreeable lo all parties. In some respects the two rela tions may have t een similar, but the doe- " 'i''eiei irom ttteoty m I'lrtotice- It both, weio e.iimlly estubliahod !

The J.'iinitK-ij'atioii I'rochi m.itioii seeiu.i uhe.t.ly to hate destroyed the all'. elioiia'c feehi.e; we have so often been t.i'.d the slave eiitel tained fur his man ic r ; so I..
