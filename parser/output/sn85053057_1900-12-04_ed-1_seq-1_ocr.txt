MESSIE IN FULL Complete Text of President McKinley's Ad dress to the Houses of the National Congress CHINESE PROBLEM TAKEN UP PHILIPPINE SITUATION IS INTERESTINGLY TREATED AND THE: FINANCIAL MATTERS ARE CAREFULLY DWELT UPON^ fy ' - - - ~ EVIDENCES OF PROSPERITY. To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: With the outgoing of the old and the beginning of tlie new century, you begin the last session of the Fifty-sixth con gress with evidences on every hand of individual and national prosperity and with proof of the growing strength and increasing.power for good to republican institutions. Your countrymen will join with you in felicitation that American liberty is more firmly established than ever before and that love for it and the determination to preserve it are more universal than at any former period of our history. The republic was never so strong, be cause never so strongly entrenched in the hearts of the people as now. The constitution with few amendments exist as it left the hands of its authors. The additions which have been made to it proclaim larger freedom and more ex tended citizenship. Popular government has demonstrated in its one hundred and twenty-four years of trial here its sta bility and security and its efficiency as the best safeguard to human rights. When the sixth congress assembled in November 1800, the population of the United States was 5,308,483. It is now 76,304,799. Then we had sixteeen states. Now we have forty-five. Then our ter ritory consisted of 909,930 square miles. It is now 3,846,595 square miles. Education, religion and morality have kept pace with our advancement in other directions and while extending its power the gov ernment has adhered to its foundation principles and abated none of them in dealing with our new peoples and posses sions. A nation so preserved und blessed gives reverent thanks to God and Invokes his guiranoe and the continuance of his care and favor. 

CHINESE PROBLEM. In our foreign intercourse, the dom inant question lias been the treatment of the Chinese problem. Apart from this, our relations with the powers have been happy. The recent troubles in China sprang from the anti-foreign agi tation which for the past three years has gained strength in the northern provinces. Their origin lies deep in the character of the Chinese races and in the traditions of their government. The Tai Ping rebellion and the opening of Chi nese ports to foreign trade and settle ment disturbed alike the homogenity and the seclusion of China. Meanwhile foreign activity made itself felt in all quartet's, not alone on the coast, but along the great river arteries and In the remoter districts, carrying new ideas and introducing new associa tions among a primitive people which had pursued for centuries a national policy of isolation. The telegraph and the railway spreading over their land, the steamers plying on their waterways, the merchant and the missionary pene trating year by year farther to the in terior, became to the Chinese mind types of an alien invasion, changing the course of their national life and fraught with vague foreboding of disaster to their beliefs and their self-control. For several years before the present troubles all tho resources of foreign di plomacy, backed by moral demonstra tions of the physical force of fleets and arms, have been needed to secure due respect for the treaty rights of foreign ers and to obtain satisfaction from the responsible authorities for the sporadic outrages upon persons and prosperity of unoffending sojourners which from time to Urne occurred at widely separated points in the northern provinces, as in the case of the outrages in Szechuen and Shang Tung. Posting of anti-foreign placards be came a dully occurrence, which the re peated probation of the imperial power failed to check or punish. These inflam matory appeals to the Ignorance and superstition of the masses, mendacious and absurd in their accusations and deeply hostile in their spirit, could not but work culmlnatlve harm. They aimed at no particular class of foreign ers; they were impartial in attacking everything foreign. An outbreak in .Shang Tung, in which German mission aries were slain, was the too natural result of the malevolent teachings. The posting of seditious placards, exhorting to the utter destruction of foreigners and of every foreign thing, continued until rebuked. Hostile demonstrations tow.-rd the stranger gained strength by organization.
