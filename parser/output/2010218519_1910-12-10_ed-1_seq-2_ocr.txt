HT Hi I 2 GOODWIN'S WEEKLY I The story as given at the time was that when the rails were Anally connected, Mr. Durant of the , ti.ion Pacific drove a silver spike and Governor Stanford a spike of gold, and so Mr. Hill said the picture was first painted. The picture also con tained the likenesses of 400 people; the faces of Hi seventy having heen painted from photographs. Hi It was at last outlined and Governor Stanford Hi went to see it. Mr. Hill Was a famous artist, at Hi first as a portrait painter, then he commenced H painting scenery. His "Yosemite Valley," "Wav- H erly Oaks," "Mount Tacoma," "The Muir Glacier," H'. and other great paintings attest his merit. "The H Driving of the Last Spike," he intended as a mas- M terpiece. H When Stanford saw the picture outlined he H was not satisfied at all. Mr. Durant was repre H sented hy Stanford's side, each with a hammer, at H which Stanford in his most impressive tone said: m "Nobody has a hammer but me, you have given B him too prominent a place." Hill said he spoke m of McCreUish, editor for years of the Alta, Cali m fornia, having a place. With flashing eyes Stan di ford asked excitedly, "Have you got that man H in?" To which Hill responded, "Yes, and it will M not be well to leave him out, being the editor of B a paper, he will annihilate me;" to which Stan ds ford answered: "I will annihilate you if he is in.'' Hj Then it was decided that Stanford's brother, A. B. H Stanford, should be put in the place saved for m McCrellish. Then Stanford ordered his enemies m relegated to the rear and his friends put in front, m some of whom were not present at all. m At first Stanford had complimented the picture H, warmly and said to the artist that he could al- most imagine himself on the spot. Then he be M' gan to criticise and ordered Strotridge to be put H in Durant's place (Strotridge constructed the H road). He ordered Dr. Harkness and Stillman H changed. Stanford first ordered Towne taken out H altogether, but on Hill's pleading consented that B he might be placed in the background. Ho finally H ordered Durant's picture placed where Mrs. Stan B ford stood and Mrs. Stanford by his side. He or H' dered out Colton's picture and added, "You can V place Senator Sargent there." (Years after the H road was finished, Mark Hopkins Jhe brainiest K one of the Big Four said that the road was made Hi possible by Senator Sargent; that the company H' . would bo glad to reward him, but he would never H accept anything. And yet Stanford with his R money, beat Sargent for United States senator H' when Sargent wanted the place.) H At last Stanford would not take the picture H1 that he had ordered. The artist finally died in a H little home he had in Yosemite Valley. His son. H Robert R. Hill, makes public the foregoing. THE message of President Taft is about the ablest paper that has emenated from the ' White House for several years. Every H word of it should be read, for it is altogether H worthy of study. The two most important sug- H gestions in it are the appeal for a new and com- H prehensive financial system, and his appeal for H legislation that will begin to re-create our mer- H chant marine. No synopsis will do it justice, H it should be read as a whole. 

ALMOST unnoticed has passed the news of the death of Major-General Wesley Merritt, H who died in Washington last Saturday; H though as a soldier he ranked right up by the H side of Custer, Crook, and the other immortals H who were young officers in the great war of the H rebellion. He earned promotion after promotion H for conspicuous services in battle at Gettysburg, H Winchester, Fisher Hill, Five Forks e jrywhere H and finally at Monitta. He was a great soldier. H France has a tariff on balloons. So polite a H nation should fear no competition in the manufac- H ture of hot air. MINING AND FINANCIAL A slight illumination of one of the historic mysteries of Utah took place at Nephi last month when a Tintic miner sued some Salt Lake brokers for $14,500 alleged to be the value of a "tip" on the discovery of the Colorado vein in the Sioux Consolidated shaft. James Morgan, according to the allegation in the complaint, is the man who gave away the big secret and thus enabled a few outsiders to share in the voluminous profits that As a reward for his loquacity Morgan was to be accrued from the subsequent rise of the stock, carried by the brokers for a large block of stock. The broke ? got the stock for him, but they sold it out before the advance reached its maximum. He sued for the difference in the profits made and the profits that would have been made if the In vestment had been nursed along for all it was worth. Sad to relate the Morgan suit was settled out of court before the judge had a chance to pass on the legitimacy of mining tips. It would be interesting to learn from the bench whether inside information is a marketable commodity. The writer has often expressed the opinion that it should be made so by statute if it is not al ready recognized as such by the interpretation of common law. As a corimodity it would be rightfully the property of stockholders and com pany officials would te liable for damages for withholding it. About four years ago there was a dull- sick ening thud on the Boston exchange which proved to have been caused by a drop of ten dollars or so in the market of Utah Consolidated mining shares. Subsequent investigation brought out the fact that an estimated increase in the cost of copper production was the cause of the decline. A similar market phenomenon last week is at tributed to a report that the supply of ore in the mine is much smaller than was indicated by ear lier estimates. J. B. Risque, the then manager, estimated the tonnage in sight three years ago as ample to maintain the prevailing rate of produc tion for seven years. Last spring a calculation by a well-known engineer cut the visible supply down to sonfething more than a million tons and now R. H. Channing, on resuming the management, is un able to find more than 300,000 tons that can bo shipped to the smelter at a profit. As the mine has been expected to provide the International smelter with ore at the rate of 1,000 tons a day this is less than one year's supply. The public , finds it difficult to believe that the powers be- r hind the International went to the expense of building the costly Tooele plant without having a reasonable assurance that its chief patron would continue its patronage for a few years at least. Hence it is not surprising that local opinion is more optimistic than the views expressed in the East. Local people, moreover, have seen so many Utah mines "come back" after passing through discouraging phases that they look for an early improvement in the prospects of this famous property. If the International smelter really does run out of copper ore it can learn something to its S advantage by communicating with a certain gen tleman whose post office address is Provo and whose local title is "Uncle." The gentleman afore said will cheerfully supply the Tooele plant with large consignments of ore and throw in some beautiful specimens of quartz without additional charge. There is no longer an attempt on the part of the Knight companies to conceal the fact that the carbonates in both the Iron Blossom and the Colorado are rapidly being supplanted by a highly silicious grade of ore. The intrusion of this unwelcome element was first brought to the attention of the reading public when the Iron Blossom had to curtail production on account of it. The occurrence of the same difficulty in the Colorado is a comparatively new development, but the annual report of the company alludes to it and in mining circles it is common talk that the increase of silica is taking the profit out of Colo rado shipments. Some speakers go so far as to assert that the company is barely breaking even on the recent consignments. If this is true, even in part, the Colorado is hardly less interested than the Iron Blossom in finding a new market and the serious consideration given by the Knights to the cyaniding scheme is explained. With all the attention that has been given to metallurgy In late years it would seem that a so- HllHSIhn "(But withal, let it hajc quality" Gift Appropriateness THE tendency to over-reach begets at times poor judgment, or none at all in the matter of the selection of proper gifts at Christmas-tide. In this regard, remember that the appropriateness of the present is , the greatest essential the one, in fact to be considered. This, regardless of price, whether high or low.
