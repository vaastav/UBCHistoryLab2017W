Winnipeg Special:—Riel's remains were brought to Winnipeg from Reginia in a private car in charge of two Catholic priests. Great difficulty was experienced with Gov. Dewdney in procuring the body. It was not known here that the body was coming and there was no one at the station to meet it, consequently no demonstration. A separate engine was bitched to the car at the station here and it was run across the river to St. Boniface, where Kiel's brother, Alexander, and a number of halt-breeds were in waiting with sleighs to receive the body. They placed it on one sleigh and drove it to his mother's home at St. Vital, where all the family and relatives were in waiting to re ceive it. The grief of the mother and wile knew no bounds when the body was carried in. The box was opened, disclosing the face, somewhat blackened and slightly disfigured. The body was washed and dressed before boing" exposed. The old home was heavily draped ia black. The body will be brought *0 St. Boniface cathe­ dral and grand requiem mass celebrated. The body will be then interred by the side of his lather ia the St. Boniface Catholic cemetery. Washington Gossip. Senator Palm.-r.of Michigan.has built an $80 ,000 house in Washington.

The Washington Evening Star says: The ruling of Commissioner Sparks, of the gen eral land office, suspending the jssue of land patents in certain sections of the west, which embraces Dakota, has creatad no little excitement in that region. Com plaining letters from settlers affected by the ruling are coming to senators. The complaint is ttt£t the commissioner's ac "tion makes the innocent suffer with the -guilty, and that it imposes the same hard ships and inconveniences upon those who purchased their homesteads honestly as those who resorted to dishonest methods. A strong effort will probably bo ide to have the ruling changed so as to apply only •to persons known to have entered their ands in an irregular manner. Personal Gossip.

The Vanderbilt family desired the re mains of the husband and father to be conveyed to the tomb with as little dis play as possible, and their wishes were re spected. Fifth avenne is not much given to display, even when a million aire is carried to his tomb, and when the hour for the funeral ol Will iam II. Vanderbilt arrfved Friday morning the 10th, there were but few indications, even in the neighborhood of the Vanderbilt home that anything unusual was going on. Just three flags fluttered at half mast among a plenty of bare poles. No badge of crape was seen anywhere except on the little electric bell at the Vanderbilt mansion. The ceremonies in the church were simple Episcopal burial services. They were con ducted by Rev. Dr. Cooke, the pas tor, and Mr. Clapp. Bishop Potter was present in his robes, but did not participate. .The priests met the pall bearers at the door of the church and pre ceded them down the center aisle, chanting as they walked along. Preceding the coffin walked the pall bearers, wearing white sashes. They wore: Chauncey M. Depew, J. Pierrepont Mor gan, Charles Rapallo, William Turnbull, William Bliss, (ieorL"-1.1. Magee, C. M. Berg^r, Charles C. Clark, Judge John R. Brady, W. L. Scott, D. 0. Mills and S. W. Caldwell.

To seethestal wart, rugged forinsof eighthall-breeds with beards covered with frost struggling under their load was a sightnevertobeforgotten. Two paces in front of the coffin walked Riel's two brothers, Joseph and Alexandre, both stalwart specimens of their race. The first sleigh in the procession contained Riel's mother, his two sisters and his wife. The poor old woman on leaving the house in sisted on walking in the procession, and did so as long as herfailingstrength would bear her up. She was at last obliged to ride in a sleigh. The ordinary requim mass was celebrated by the clergy at the cathedral, The poor mother was weeping piteously, I as were also other members of the family I and relatives, a large number of whom were present. Tho Ies Moines Valley Land], Senator Wilson, of Iowa, has renewed his proposition to settle the old and vexed question of title in the Des Moines ralley. These lands are along the Des Moines above hacoon fork. Under a grant in aid of a canal in 1846, they were improperly certi fied by the department of the interior to the state of Iowa, therefrom located lands sold by the United States, the state re ceived indemnity lands for them, and the Iowa legislature, in 1866, ratified the ac ceptance. By this act the state was stop ped from all claims to the grant in the Des Moines valley. Settlers went on these granted lands supposing they were part of the public domain, the statu treated them as trespassers, and sued them. What a Fall Was There. Chicago, Special.—Hon. Henry O'Connor appeared in the Armory court as prosecut ing witnesB against Fred Hart, for having, he alleged, robbed him of his pocket book and a railroad pass.

Awful Italian Vengeance, The trial commenced at Rome a fewdnye ago of a butcher named Toszzi, and his wife, son and daughter, who are charged with the murder of one Poggi, also a butcher. The motives for the crime were trade jealousy and family disputes. Poggi was en trapped into Toszzi's cellar, where the mur der was committed. The body of the vic tim was cut into pieces and the remaine were scattered in a suburban wood. The blood was boiled into black puddings which were sold in Tozzi's shop. The son made a confession. He narrated the story in court with a cold-blooded cynicism that pro voked a howl of fury, the audience yelling, "Away with him to the scaffold!" In re ply the murderer tauntingly screamed, "Here I am—tear me to pieces!" The ter rible story has created intense excitement throughout the city.

She has four entire sets which belonged to Queen Isaballa of Spain, the mother of the present King. It will be remembered that the Queen at one time was in Paris in such needy circumstances that she had to sell her jewels and other valua bles. Governor Stanford bought the four complete sets at that time. Each set has tiarras, necklaces, brooches, ear-rings, bracelets, and other orna ments. the rays which are emitted are of a violet hue. These are tho rarest oi all-diamonds. Another set give-i out rose-colored Hashes another has yel low tints, and the fourth pure white. The price paid for these sets was $G00, 000. Outside of these Mrs. Stanford hiis one.necklace which cost 8100,000, and tho pendant $30,000. She also has many black diamonds, and has sixty rings of great magnificence, and does not wear any. She has emeralds, pearls and rubies in addi tion to a million dollars of diamonds. She is the bereaved mother who mourns a doad boy, and finds no con solation in wealth or splendor. Sena tor Stanford has taken the house own ed by Gen. Brady, of the star-route fame. It is a pleasant house, situated on Farragut square, and the Senator will give dinners and accept invita tions, bat his wife will not appear in society.

The place had been long de serted, had acquired an evil name, was known to be the resort of thieves and smugglers, and, the New York po lice said, was the headquarters of a gang of river pirates. It was, indeed, to break up this nest of scoundrels, who had found that, being United States property, the old fort was never visited by the police, that I was to take possession of the is land." "It was a gray, raw day in Novem ber rain had fallen in the .afternoon, and, when boats containing my little command reached our destination, a cold fog hung over the harbor and the rising wind howled about the old bar rack, adding to the gloom and in creasing the dreary desolation of the mildewed old walls.

Soldiers are rapid, because systematic, workers, and before nightfall all were made comfortable, and the supper served to them which did credit to the com pany's cook«. I visited and inspected every part ofthe island—a mere speck in the harbor, as you know—looked attic, examined bolts and doors, then, having given orders for the night, closed the great gate leading in to the fort and retired to my quar ters."' "I certainly am not either a timid or an imaginative man, but there was something to the last degree depressing in the place that night. The wind, which had driven away the fog, howl ed and mourned in the deserted place the rats trooped up and within the partition walls, and there rose a strange, earthly smell which reminded me, I scarce knew why, of new-made graves. Now and then some sea-bird's scream could be heard, or the distant roar of the foghorn of some passing ship was added to the sighing and groaning of the wind. I sat down and read the one or two newspapers I chanced to have in my pocket, wrote out a few memoranda, then opened fe&st hMrt W 1 placed upon the little table, put a number of articles of daily use on a little shelf, and then, although it was still early, not more than 10, I be lieve, I made my toilet lor.the night, turned out the lamp and jumped into bed. I had placed my pistol, a self cocking Colt of the largest size, under my pillow, but no sooner was the lamp out and all' was dark than the tales told by the New York police came forcibly to my mind, and I almost regretted not having posted a sentinel inside the little fort. Then I felt like laughing at myself for such absurd apprehensions. Still I could not sleep. I was just doz ing off when a rat skurrying along or the wild scream of some passing sea gull would arouse me with a start to toss and fret for another quarter of an hour." At last sleep came calm, peaceful, dreamless sleep. How long I slept I have no idea perhaps lor an hqur, perhaps for two. Then, from within my very room, of which I had seen every window barred, every 4oor bolt ed and locked, there came a long, low moaning cry, ending with a shriek so horrible, so ghastly, that I am not ashamed to say that, as I rose in my moment head." pr It, was bui Iot a mojnent. A faint iiqkt f$m iaie'iranii^-modn came in tnwnigh th&? ^htitters, and, as I rose, there •rose'ta!toss the room a Ions white figure! what? -.X saw it start frojQ^theajBooi* and grow to a man's siza 'OT riSre. iftnd as I gazed, heard thfaift dreadful shriek! What? Jio matter. It was something, and its presence returned all my eombative ness^and angpr hof, fiery wrath was my only feeling." '"Some scoundrel,' said I to myself 'is playing me a trick. Some of these pirate smugglers have arranged aghost for me, have they? Well, we'll see who can play ghost the best."' "As I rose I had taken my six-shoot er from under my. pillow, and now I called out: 'Who are you? What are you doing there, you scoundrel?' No reply. 'Who are you? Answer, or I'll shoot.' Still there was silence. My pistol waspointed a little above the centre of the figure, and again I cried: 'Answer or I'll shoot.' No answer came, and I pulled the trigger. I was sure of my aim, and yet the bullet seemed to burv itself harmlessly into the wall beyond. Lowering my aim I sent another ball somewhat lower, awl then a third, almost totheground. Still the figure neither moved or spoke. injured by lend. As the third shot left my pistol I leaped from the bed and rushed upon the shadow form. A box of cartridges lay upon the table and these 1 thrust into the breast pocket of my night dress. Cocking my revolver as I ran. I tried to seize the intruder with my left hand, flinging myself with all force upon him." "Horrors! An instant later I was thrown down, down. I knew not how far or where. The floor seemed to have opened and swallowed me up. With a crash I came to the bottom of the pit, bruised, bleeding and in utter darkness." "Confused half unconscious,I strug gled to my feet, and once more there came, first that moaning cry, and then the dreadful scream which had roused me from my sleep!" "You know how little superstition there is in my nature—some say, in deed, too little, for it is difficult forme to believe in anything not patent to my senses but at that moment there crept into my soul a grisly fear of something not of this world. A shud der ran throuah my frame. I could feel my eyes dilate and open, to their utmost and a sweat, cold as ice, min gled from my brow with the blood trickling from my wounds. All was still as death. I tried to shout my throat, dry, parched and contracted, refused its ottiee. No sound came to break that horrid silence. I strained my eyes into the black obscurity which encompassed them—a darkness v. hich pressed upon me which seemed to hold me, breathless, in its infernal embrace. Nothing. A void, vast as the universe, narrow as a tomb. My shuddering feet stood upon a some thing dark, dark and cold, as if they rested on a nest of serpents above, around, a silent pall of unutterable obscurity. My elbow touched the wall. I started as if stung by a scor pion or as if ghostly hands had siezed me from the nameless mystery which lay around. My heart stopped and then sent the blood whirling to the brain in sickening force. Was I mad? Was this a fever-born dream?" "Some dreadful thing, cold,slimy, as was everything in this hideous tilace, crawled or wiggled from under and be side my feet. Spots red and green be gan to dance like demons' eyes in the distance—formed probably' by pres sure of the blood upon the brain and nerves." "I have twice or thrice since then faced what seemed like probable death without much feeling about the mat ter, but the foe was visible, tangible not a hideous void like that I faced that November night." "Again I tried to call out, and this time a faint, hoarse sound, which seemed to be the voice of another, is sued from my lips." "I had struck my head violently in the rapid descent, but gradually my senses returned and drove off the nameless dread, only to replace it. with a feeling of helplessness, almost of des pair. The air was bitterly cold, cold with a vault-like chill which stiffened my limbs (clad as I was in a sinele linen garment) to the bone. But, with the return of thought came the better feeling of a wish to at least struggle for existence. I tried to collect my ideas, to in some manner explain how the strange thing could possibly have happened. It was all alike reasoning around a circle." "What had been in my room? How came it there? What had it done to me? How could I possibly have gone through the floor? Where had I gone? Through what agency? So, back again to who had been in my room? How came it" there? and so on through the round again. The more I thought the more inexplicable became the whole affair, but at least I could now think— not shiver in nameless terror." "I knew not where I was, but I felt sure that no sound I could make would reach the men, all of whom were outside the fort. Even from the ground-floor room it was quite cer tain that, especially on such a night with the waves beating against the sides of the islet, no mere report of a pistol could be heard a distance." "Where could I be? Was this some trick of the thieves who had held the deserted fort so long? It was dark as only a windowless vault can be even at night. Not one ray to show me if the place were large or small—a cellar or a well. By what possible agency could I have been thus hurled into this pit? I had paced over the whole room and there certainly was no opening in the floor unless it had been most carefully masked. Besides this, I felt sure that my fall had been much greater than the distance from the room I had slept in to the cellar. My brain was still somewhat clouded by the blow my head had received, and which I thought had been struck just before my fall, or rather, before kny being violently thrown downward." "Fortunately my pistol was still in my hand and the box of cartridges in my pocket. I felt carefully for the wall, placed my back against it, and, determining to sell my life dearly if at tacked, waited a moment in silence. All was still. Taking thebox as noise lessly as possible from the pocket of my night shirt I reloaded my pistol. Still nothing. But I was freezing. The slimy stones beneath my bare feet were rapidly chilling my blood. If I fire my pistol, I thought, I may s£e where I am. I fired twice." "It was the cellar which I had ttl ready visited! I hadonly, then^len IX) or 12 feet. I- at once remembered that to this cellar there was a dooi, by im external mm- iHf life steps leaditig to the gjoiindin front of the room in which I had slept. An Other shot showed me the door, on which, however, there was a heavy, old-fashioned lock without a key. Half a dozen shots from my revolver broke the rustic iron—and I waa free!" "Covered w'th blood and slime, I stood at length beneath the stars my head ached violently, my teeth chat tered with cold, but I was free! 0,the delight of that moment! Free!" "My first feeling was that it was my duty to call some of the men and search the house but that I could not bring myself to do. No, I must not be seen by them in such a plight, nor must they come until I had: solved the mystery. My own outer door waa too securely bolted to force open but making my way through another en trance,! easily blew the lock off an inner doorofcommtinication. Graspingmv pistol tightly, I cautiously entered. There, directly across the room, was thefigure!" "Bang! bang! and I sent two more bullets crushing through it. Whatever it was it certainly was no living thing. If not, what then? What or who had struck me that blow? Who had open ed the solid floor and cast me into the pit beneath? With eye and ear upon the alert ready for foe, human or other, I reached the table where the lamp stood and felt for a match. None. But I had some in my pocket. My clothes were upon the other side ofthe bed. I went slowly around, found the matches, came back to the table, and keeping my pistol in my right hand, removed the globe and chimney of the lamp, struck a light, took a hurried look about the room, put the fire to the wick, replaced the chimney, and turned again to the white mystery. There it stood but whatitwaslcould not even guess. One thing was certain, it had not been there when I went to bed. In the light it looked like agreat white box some ten feet high' open on the sides, and standing against the wall opposite the foot of the bed. Taking up the lamp I walked toward it. What is that on top? By heavens, it is my trunk!" "What do you think the ghost was! It was.an old, white-painted dumb waiter leading to the former kitchen. My trunk had chanced to be placed di rectly on its top, which was level with and formed part of the floor. The jar and the footsteps had loosened its old weights. I had taken the tray of clothes from tlje trunk, and the dumb waiter gradually loosened had shot up, as such things will at times do—a couple of hours letter. It had long been discused and the shelvings removed. When, therefore, I rushed at it I had simply fallen into a hole, some three feet by two in the floor between the elevator's sides had struck the bottom board, the machine had gone down with me, and, my weight removed, had again risen. I had come down very hard on the stone paving in the former kitchen, had cut myself on some projecting edge, for there were two pretty bad places from which theblood still drip ped—and that was my ghost that the mysterious agency which had 'hurled* me into that'awful' pit!" "Did you ever hear of a ghost doing more? I never heard of one who could do half so much." "But just think if I had gone bare footed and bedraggled, called up my men, and led them to combat with— an old white dumb-waiter!" The Yankee Girl's Choice. From the Portland Sunday Welcome. Residing on the Clackamas River, in Clackamas county, Oregon, is a good old quaker couple, whose pretty daughter, with her "thees" and "thous" and chaste style of dressing, has been more thoroughly admired than any one for miles around. The fameof her beauty was not confined to the immediate neighborhood of her father's farm, but had reached the ears of a stalwart young stonecutter of this city, named Stafford, and also the auriculars of a gay young rail road engineer, named Morgan. Both fell in love with the modesfj girl at first sight, the parents objecting to Stafford, who is a Catholic, while the daughter manifested a slight prefer ence for him. To make along story short, Stafford was so devoted in his attentions that, unknown to the parents, he succeeded in engaging him self to the object of his adoration,and gave her §100 with which to purchase a few necessary articles of wearing apparel. This reaching the father's ears, lie sent for Stafford and Morgan —the latter appearing upon the scene accompanied by two friends—and with his pretty daughter met them all in his little parlor. The feelings of the rivals can well be imagined"when the blunt old Quaker announced to his daughter that her two admirers were before her, and that although he preferred the engineer, he would leave the choice of her future husband entirely to her. The poor girl burst into tears, and it could be plainly seen by the tumul tuous heaving of her bosom that a great struggle was going on between filial devotion on one side and love for the choice of her young heart on the other. Pending the decision Stafford and Morgan hardly dared raise their eyes from the carpet. At last, with a mighty effort and a voice full of tears, the young Quakeress, sobbed the name of Stafford, and gently put her hand in his. Morgan accepted the situation like a sensible fellow, and, with his friends, left the house sans ceremonie.
