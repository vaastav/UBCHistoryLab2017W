Christiania, Norway, Dec. 20.— Every nation in the world will soon look upon the American peace pil grims aa taking the initiative in stop ping history's worst war. The landing of the peace expedition in Europe will be recorded as one of the most'benevolent things the Ameri can republic ever did," said Henry Ford yesterday to the Associated Press representative on stepping ashore on Norwegian soil. The steamship Oscar II, carrying the Ford peace expedition, arrived at this port on Saturday after a fourteen days' voyage from New York. The delegates expressed much displeasure because the vessel was delayed three e-qbSdthefio.fldcsk. .enol days by the British authorities at Kirkwall Scotland. Ford Confident. Mr. Ford said he was confident the expedition would result in getting the men out of the trenches before the winter was over. He declared he had information from official sources that liis peace plan was looked upon ap provingly. He added that his motive in coining to Europe was to develop to the full an understanding through out the world by the time peace ses sions were begun at The Hague. Wil liam Jennings Bryan, ex-secretary of state, was expected to join the peace party there, he said. Mr. Ford explained the presence of the American party in Norway was merely intended to convince the Nor wegians of the fervent wish of Ameri cans for peace. He expects to gather a Norwegian delegation here, and then In about three days proceed to Stockholm. Sweden. He said the party would grow as it traveled, through back, upstanding and neutral countries and that this would point. convince the bellegrents that the rest of the world demanded peace immedi ately. By this time Copenhagen will be visited and The Hague reached, probably two weeks hence, Mr. Ford •aid, the peace movement would have a different program. The members of the Ford party landed at '8 o'clock yesterday morning end went to various hotels. Meetings Begin Today. After holding meetings while cross ing the Atlantic and disagreeing over the question of the American prepar edness policy, the 150 peace advo cates on arriving were anxious to learn what attitude would be adopted toward them by Europe. Receptions by Christiana preachers and univer sity professors and an unofficial call made by Albert Schmedeman, Ameri can minister to Norway, attended the first day of the members of the peace expedition in Europe. Formal meet ings will begin today. Christiania newspapers publish long articles' regarding the Ford expedi tion, accompanying the stories with cartoons from foreign newspapers. Hold Meeting on Ship. Ju«t before the Oscar II reached Chf-istlania, the Ford guests held a public meeting aboard the ship.

Washington, Dec. 20.—There have been many weddings here in private life where more costly collections of gifts have been seen than that at the marriage of the president to Mrs. Gait, but. few where the gifts have been so many and have covered such a wide range. This is just as the bride and bride groom wanted it. Their preference was openly expressed In favor of a wedding at which there would be no gifts of an official character, and dip lomats and most other officials, except the president's close friends, took the hint. The bride received several beautiful pieces of jewelry. Among them was a diamond bar pin given her by the president a week ago and which she' has worn. It is four and a half inch es in length and an eighth of an Inch wide,-w|th fine white stones set in platinum. This Is in. addition to the brooch which the bride wore with her wed ding costume. The brooch contains larger stones and was given by the president as the wedding gift. Another bar pin was of diamonds and sapphires. This is said to have come from Colonel and Mrs. E. M. House. A flexible gold, braolet, set with sapphires was another piece of jew elry. The giver was not disclosed. Among the presents were several clocks. One, a Swiss clock in a trav eling case of leather, was carried on the honeymoon- A Tiffany glass and brass desk set, and a bed spread from Porto Rico of fillet of lace of elabor ate design and beautiful workmanship were other gifts.

Berlin, Dec. 20.—Count Ernst von Reventlow, naval expert, writing in the Tages Zeitung, further discusses the Armenian question, using as his text an expression contained In a pamphlet Just published by C. Adolf Bratter, a Berlin political writer. Count von Reventlow cites this book as saying Armenian atrocities always arise in the same way, 1. e., "revolutionary Armenians are Incited by Great Britainor~ Russia-to upris ing, rebellion and treason. Full of Bitterness, the Turks for decades have been vainly endeavoring to suppress these conspiracies." Bratter's book further declares that. "Great Britain, with the help of Rus sia and France in' the present case, planned an extended conspiracy In Armenia with the purpose of having an uprising occur at the moment when tho allies entered the Dardanelles Unfortunately for the Armenians, the uprising came too soon." Count von Reventlow welcomes the book, saylnp: "It is high tiiqe Germans compre hended the real meaning of Armenian atrocity affairs. They should finally understand that It is not our affair to feel or oven express sympathy with Armenian revolutionaries and usurers Who form a great and malignant dan ger for our brave, tried and true Turkish allies, and who are the tool of bur mortal enemies—Great Britain and Russia. •If the Turks did not defend them selves energetically and thoroughly against the Armenian danger when ever it arises, they would. be doing their allies as well as themselves a bad service.

Germany did not Accept the Support of Law Violators, Declaration. is New York, Dee.. 20.—The\New York Times has received the following au thorized statement by wireless from Berlin: "The German government naturally has never knowingly accepted the support of any person, group or per sons, society^ nr organization seeking to promote .-the cauf* of Germany in the United- States -.ay illegal acts, by counsels of violence, by/ contravention of law or by any means whatever that could offend the American people in the pride of their own authority. Proof is Wanted. "If it should be alleged that Im proper acts have been committed by representatives of the German govern ment, they could lie easily dealt with. To any complaints upon proof as may be submitted by the American govern ment suitable response will be duly made. Communication Is Difficult. "As is well known, the means of communication between Germany and the United States are. very unsatisfac tory. It is practically Impossible for the German government to keep It self in tpuch with American senti ment it has often to depend upon the foreign press for information concern* ing American affairs. "The message of President Wilson to congress, in which the activities of German sympathizers In the United States were discussed, will serve as an illustration. There was received In Germany a brief summary of those passages which referred to plots and conspiracies against peace and order in the United States, and the effect produced thereby upon sentiment In Germany was probably more painful than the American government knew. English Version Doubted. "A different Impression might have been produced by, the full text of the meisage, but unfortunately that would not be available in Germany until the American newspapers arrived by mall, a fortnight or three weeks later, ex cept as it might be taken with doubts and reservation from the English press. "In the meantime, confidential com munication between the German gov ernment and its diplomatic represehta. tlves in the United States by cable or wireless is impossible for reasons which the American government knows. Messages by cable must pats through the English censorship and messages in secret code by wireless are forbidden. Therefore misunder standings are bound to arise, while explanations are often so circumscrib ed or belated as to be not wholly ef fective.
