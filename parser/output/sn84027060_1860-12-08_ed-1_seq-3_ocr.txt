The original, hearty diauniooista want to estab Hah a Military Republic on the Spartan model— a republic baaed on Slavery, upholding and proaeeuting the African Slave trade, and making war on Mexico and Central America for neu provinces to exhauat, as well as fomenting innu- Let it be everywhere thundered, then, that the present and fearful peril of the Republican cause is Compromise—that concessions to save the Union are themselves tbe source of the greatest danger to tbe Union. If Lincoln's clec tion does not secure him obedience—negotia tion, apology, concession, never will. To tam per with the spirit of rebellion is to pander to it to seek to plscate it is to retreat before it aad invite it to pursue. Mr. Lincoln'* dignified if not indignant refusal to plead at ita bar, hia fixed purpoee to speak of his views and purposes only when he insy spetk at once with propriety and with authority, is among tbe many proofs of his fitness for the high station to which tbe peo ple have called him. So State but South Carolina really wanta to leave the Union but a dosen States, will gladly make her contumacy a lever whereby to move the North from its upright poeition. Let Vir ginia believe that, bv threatening to dissolve the Union, she msy frighten the Free States into a waiver of further resistance to slavery extension, and she will make the demand, declaring that a refusal will send her into the secession camp aad having presented that ultima torn, tho pride of consistency will constrain her to adhere to it. What the country urgently needs la a con viction that nothing will bo yielded to menace tbat has not been conceded to argument Let thia convictioo be diffused, and the Union will bravely outride the storm that now threatens it, or will be strengthened by the departur»of the States that perversely break away. The calm courage which makea no response to railing ae cuaations, but cherishes a serene faith in the ultimate triumph of Right, is to-day tbe most precious element in tho composition of American statesmanship.
