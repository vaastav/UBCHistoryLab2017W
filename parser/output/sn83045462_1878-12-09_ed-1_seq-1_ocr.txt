The secret senate committee investigating the omission of the Hot springs clause from the sundry civil service appropriation bill ol last session met again this morning, and examined Thomas A. Britt, a temporary employe 1 of ti e secret service division of the Treasury department, who is the person that m id the rej f it to secretary Sherman, which was sent to Mr. Atkins and by him to tills committee. THE STATEMENT OK BKITT ! was very rambling, and consisted to a consider able extent of conversations he had with parties. and what might be proven by them. He had been employed to mak > "an inve-tigation of the Hot springs affair, and had prosecuted his inquiries for some time, on the 7th \ of July met a man in front of the Imperial hotel, who ashed him if lie had received a letter from Mr. Brooks saying that he thought thai he had followed tip' Hoi Springs matrer up ? as far as it was worth while. Declined to talk ] to ti-.e man until ho showed to iilin that he was , Mr. Benson, assistant chief of the secret ser- l vice division. Benson then showed him a t memorandum by one K. N. Hill, which stated ] that Mr. Rice stole the bill. While they were < talking Rice came up, and on their expressing < surprise to find that he wa>not in Florida he said that he had received a letter saying Sena- | tor Conover was til. They had. however, seen him on the street that day. Pursued the inves- i ligation until witness received notice that i liis services would be discontinue^ j Witness related interviews with certain parties 1 named Boyd. Coleman and Hull, who had m ide , affidavits as to the matter. Had seen a letter from John T. Foster to Mr. Brooks, chief of the i secret service division, in which he said he had seen Senator Conover, who declared he lml no knowledge of ; he theft, but was glad it was done. To Senator Randolph:?Was in Florida in ls76 as correspondent of the savannah Nets*. Was assigned to duty In this matter to,. Mr. Brooks. Did not know at whose Instance, but supposed It was on the recommendation of ex-Go wrnor , Stearns, of Florida. Senator Dorsey asked if Mr. Brooks had said any thing to him about himself and Mr. Atkins I having anything to do with the bill. Witness?Mr. Brooks once said to me "they say Dorsey and Atkins had something to do with this; you had better look them over." Had gone far enough to satisfy himself they had nothing to do with the abstraction or omission. senator Dor.-ey said he had been a very act ive supporter of the Hot Springs bill, and he did not care to be pursued by Treasury detectives. He hoped a transcript of this statement would be sent by the committee to the Secretary of the Treasury. s. B. Benson, assistant chief of the secret service division, was next called. His tirst knowledge of t he omission or abstraction of the Hot springs biil was received from a lawyer nanvd 11. 15. curmnings, who said a man told him he could find out who did it. Communicated Hill s assertion to Solicitor Kay nor. who conferred with Mr. Atkins. Mr. Atkins subsequently addressed a note to the Secretary of the Treasury, asking t hat t he Treasury detectives investigate the matter and learn whether the omission oeeurred by accident or design. Mr. Benson was on the stand when our report closed. Tin* Indian Transfer Question* VIEWS 0V EX-SENATOR M0RKII.!,. The Indian commission to-day heard the views of ex-Senator Lot M. Morrill, of Maine; on the ouestion of transfer. He took the ground that we are. in our transactions with the Indians, dealing with the remnants of a race that we are in duly bound to respect and aid in every possible manner. lie advocated a radical change in existing laws, and considered tills the onlymethod ot reaching the desired result. The present management, in complying with the law. he thought, unable to deal successfully with the red man. They the Indians) should be, in his judgment, localized and properly educated. in order that they might be prepared to meet the coming emergency of delivering up their lands to American settlers, and that this must eventually occur to meet the requirements of tte fast increasing while populat'on. Legislation which would protect the Indians from the depredations of whites was an absolute necessity. Iledid not think ihe transfer would b? beneficial in meeting his Ideas upon the subject Localization and education, he said, were" th only means to be applied to save the In;liaa ric-1 from extinction. Mr. Morrill went into dei dis upon the question at issue, submitting in evidence many facts heretofore treated bv those ( favoring the management of the Indians'bv the civil bureau of the government. At the con elusion oi his direct testimony, General Hooker indulged In a brief cross question, which, lio.vever, resulted In eliciting nothing material. . TliE INVESTIGATION OKA WING TO A CLOSE. I Mr. John Young, agent of the Blackfeet Indians of Montana, was next, sworn and briefly ; examined by chairman Saunders. He said t he Indians under his Jurisdiction were unanimous- i ly opposed to the proposed transfer; that thev were enterprising ana contented, and he was of i opinion that the transfer was inadvisable. Sen- i ator McCreery, at the close of Mr. Young's remarks. suggested that the evidence be now i closed. Ceii. Hooker, in that connection, ex- i pressed a desire to hear the lestimony of two 1 gentlemen to-morrow with regard to the state- i lr.ent concerning beef cor <racts submitted by Indian Commissioner Ilayt on Saturday. The commission thereupon, on motion of Represen- < tative Stewart, adjourned until to-morrow at 10 < o'clock. Mr. Stewart announcing that lie would 1 at the conclusion of to-morrow's session make a i motion that the commission proceed to the pre. partition of their report. The District in Congress. 1 WORK OF THE 1I0CSE COMMITTEE. Chairman Williams, of the District of Columbia Committee, to-day directed a letter or invl- | tation to be written to Major Twining, of the i District Commissioners, to appear before the * District committee on Wednesday next and explain the estimates submitted for the engi- ' neer's department or the District government. Tte District committee is engaged in the prep- < a ration of a bill to remodel the existing license law of the District, and it will be retried to 1 the House soon arter the Christmas holidays. i STREET KAII.R0AD BILLS. 1 The bill introduced in the House to-diy, by J Mr. Henkle, of Maryland, amendatory of the act 1 to incorporate the Capitol, North o street and 1 south Washington railway company, authorizes ! said company to lay a single or double track ! road from Its present line on E and nth streets northwest eastward on E street to loth; thence south on 10th street to 1); thence eastward on D street to stb: thence south on sth street to Mar- , ket space; thence eastward on said Market space to 7th street; thence across 7th street to ; Louisiana avenue and Indiana avenue, to connect with the tracks of said company at 1st i street.

The receipts from collections on account of < the current revenues of the District during the month or Noxember, in the office of Collector J. < F. cook, were upwards of $750,ooo. t since the present dog law went Into effect there have been sold at the Collector's office '< 4,.132 dog tags. l Commissioner Caswell, of the Washington asylum, in a note to the District commissioners, states that there is a blacksmith shop with two forges erected at the workhouse, and suggests that the tools in common belonging to the District be hereafter repaired there, credit to b3 given on the books of the controller at the prices now paid.

Treasurer Gllrtllan has submitted to secretary Sherman a report on the sinking fund of the District which he is by law required to make. Pursuant to provisions of the act of June 11, ist*. the books, records, riles of the r nice, and the balance of moneys to the credit of the commissioners 01 the sinking-fund were transferred to the Treasurer of lhe United stares on the 1st of July last. The report says: Assuming the amount appropriated fir t'he Mtiklng fund for each loan to be invested ar the beginning cf each year, in bonds of that loan at par. with interest compounded semiannually. and appropriations to be made for the interest on the full amount of the loans. Including the sinking fund, it appears upon cwnuaiion that the following amounts should b ' demoted annually to the sinking fund duriiv the remainder as the periods which the several loans have to run: For the market stock "ooals. fir>.in'(t; for the 6 per cent, permanent iuinro.ement bonds. $H'i,5"9; for the urst Issue of 7 p>r ' nt. permanent improvement bonds, $7.1135 2S; for the 2i? year 6 per cent, rundlng loan binds. f2e.1s3.s-l: for the 3" year r> per cent, funding loan bonds. J7.T72.2T: for the .-><> \e.tr 3.r,*> binds, T< n>(>: total annual appropriation re.-iulred F2r>6.221.25. But half of this, or fl2S.lin.7-2, will be paid from the revenues of the District. This is b it a lery small percentage of the deb: of the District, being, in fact less than six-tenths of one per cent. of t lie debt, and less t han eleven cents : f the tax 011 each ?looof property?a prooortion much less than that set apart in is73,*the elate of the last enactment upon t he subject. 1 sincerely hope that the sinking-fund will not be dependent for means upon whatever surplus funds may remain after the demands for repairs of streets and so wers are all s.i> isti-Ml. but that in future the laws relating to the debt of the District may be fully carried out. The estimate of S25ti,221.25 for the sinking fund is ba^ed upon the requirements of existing laws, and cannot properly be reduced while they remain in force, it is. however, objected on behalf of the authorities of the District, that the amount is unreasonably large, and that it will curtail more than Is judicious the amount to to applied to the repair and improvement of the stuets and sewers, on the other hand, it is claimed that tlie obligation t<? maintain the sinking fund under existing laws, being a matter of contract wit lit he creditors of the Hist rie;. should be st rletly complied with. It is believed that substantial justice will be done to all of the interests affected, by making provision for a sinkinglnndsullicient tor the extinguishment of the entire debt upon the maturity of the 3.tr> loan. The funded debt of the District, exclusive of the water stock, for the payment of which provision is made out of the'water fund, is ci.<'>:;.tCiii. Assuming that the amount appropriated tor the sinking fund could be Invested so as to yield four per cent, per annum upon the investment, the proposed object could be accomplished by the annual" appropriation of ?'T2.2C{).13. The annual amount required for interest, exclusive of the Interest on the water fctock, which is payable out of the water fund, is 12, making the amount required tor both 1 sinking fund and interest $l.i55.5s3..">. in order to save the necessity for annual ap- i propriat tons for the sinking fund and Interest ! on the debt, and for drawing and reinvesting j the interest 011 the sinking fund, it is reconi- j mended that a permanent annual appropriation ! be made of the above gross amount for loth i purposes by a general enactment, and that the provisions of law be repealed which require the Inscription upon the books of the sinking-fund of the amount of the bonds purchased on that account, and the draw ing and reinvestment of the interest thereon. The amount available for the sinking fund would increase from year to j year as 1 he interest charge should diminish, it is also recommended that the amount appro- ' printed for these purposes be made parable j from the proportional appropriation made bv . rutted states, and that it take precedence of all : other dues and demands. The following draft of an act to effect this ob- i ject is respectfully submitted forvour eonsid- i eration and that of Congress, it is believed to embody a proposit ion upon which the represen- | tativesof alltiie interests involved can unite, , and wdiich will remove out of the Held of controversy all questions affecting the malnie- ! nauce of the sinking fund and tiie payment or the interest on the debt of the District: l!c it enacted. ,( < .. That there is hereby ap- i propjiated out of the revenues of the District of Columbia for the liseal year ending June ' l>so, iiiid for each fiscal year 1 hereafter until i the debt of the said I)ist rict and of tiie citie> or Washington and (Georgetown shall be entirely . extinguished. the sum of .*l.ir?5.5s.i..v>, lor the payment of the interest on the funded debt of i the said District and cities, exclusive of the i water sloe!-;, and for the maintenance of a siuk- i ing fund for the redemption thereof, which I sum is hereby constituted a permanent annual | appropriation, and shall be annually charged ! to the appropriation for the year by the rutted i states for its proportion of the expenses of the i District of Columbia. And the payment of the sum hereby appropriated shall have priority of all other claims and demands upon 'the ' revenees of the said District, whether arising ! from taxation or from appropriations by 1 he United states, and the same shall be disbursed by the Treasurer of the I'nited suites upon the warrant of the Secretary of the Treasury. And any excess of the said sum over and above the amount required for the pavment of interest on the funded debt, exclusive of the , water stock, shall be applied by the Treasurer I of the tnlted States to the purchase and re- j aemption of the debt of the said District and of ! the cities of Washington and Georgetown in 1 Lhe manner prescribed by existing laws: /v..rival, That so much of the act of the Legislative Assembly of the said District, approved August li?, ls7l, entitled "An act to create commission- ! s?rs of the sinking fund and to prescribe their : iuties,'* as requires the said commissioners to 1 inscribe on their books the amount of bonds, i stocks, and certificates of indebtedness pur- I Phased by them on account of the sinking-fund, \ ind to collect the Interest thereon, be, and the auie Is hereby, repealed. rile Banquet to John Hcrttliougli.

Aside Tom the speeches complimentary to Mr. Mccullough as an actor and gentle nan, the very uesenee of such a company, embracing so nany men of distinction to do him honor, was lie highest kind of tribute to hismerits.
