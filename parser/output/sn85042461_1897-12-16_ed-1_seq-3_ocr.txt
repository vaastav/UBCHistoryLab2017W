DURRANT'S SENTENCE Just Like the Three Which Preceded It JANUARY SEVENTH THE DATE BET FOB THE EXPIATION 07 HIS CRIME Tbe Murderer Himself Loses Heart, But His Attorneys Strongly Hops for Further Stay Associated Press Special Wire. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. IB.—Another death day haa boon set tot Durrant. This time It Is January 7th. the very first Friday ln the now year. It could not well be sooner, for the law demands Its ten days between the pronouncing of the judgment and the carrying of It Into effect, and It would be a hard-hearted Judge who would order a man hanged Ixi the midst of tho Christmas holidays. And so Durrant will now see Christmas and New Year. There was that in the air of today's court scene that seemed to betoken a swift and Buro Judgment. Durrant's at torneys looked worried and harrassed, with all their old-time easy nonchalance departed. The prisoner himself paled and reddened by turns and though he stood unwlnkingly to his fate, his con stant swallowing, tho twitching muscle in his cheek and an occasional tremor of the chin told of the battlo waged within and the successive victories. But he had a troubled forehead, and men said: "He knows he'll never be brought here again." It did seem like a final sen tence, but as the previous prophecies havo gono so far astray, the amateur soothsayers were silent. Tho condemned man, with his father and the prison officials, returned to San Quentln on the 12:35 boat. The trip was without Incident worthy of note. His attorneys made a desperate effort to secure further delay and pave the way for another appeal to tho Supreme Court, but Judge Bahrs was inexorable and overruled each and all objections made to the proceedings. Durrant was delivered Into the cus tody of tho Sheriff by Wtrden Hale at T:3O o'clock this morning, and, attired tn a neat suit of dark clothes, which had been token over to him by hiß mother yesterday, the condemned man was es corted across the bay by Chief Jailer Battler and a Deputy, arriving In this City at 9 o'clock. He was at once taken to the City Jail ln a hack, and, as on pre vious occasions, remained ln the report ers' room, adjoining Judge Cook'scourt room, until the tlmo arrived for his ap pearance. Fully an hour before the time set for the proceedings the courtroom was packed with a morbidly curious crowd of men and women, in about equal num bers, and hundreds more, who were un able to effect an entrance, swarmed in the corridors and about the stairways up which it was expected that the fam ous criminal would appear. Squads of policemen attempted In vain to keep the Struggling mass of humanity within bounds, but their curiosity was too great to admit of restraint. Shortly before 10 o'clock Durrant was escorted Into the courtroom by the of ficers, and apparently unconscious of the mob which craned Its necks to catch a fleeting glimpse of him, walked calmly to the seat reserved for him, nodding to acquaintances on either side. After shaking hands with his chief counsel, Eugene Deuprey, Durrant leaned back in his chair and held a whispered con versation with his father, who occupied a seat immediately behind him, until the bailiff announced tho arrival of Judge Bahrs and formally declared court in Session. Judge Bahrs examined several documents and arranged the papers ln the Durrant case. While so engaged, Attorney Deuprey arose nnd addressing the court, announced that he desired to make a preliminary motion and submit an affidavit of the defendant ln support thereof. He then read several extracts from the various articles of the Consti tution of the United States and of Cali fornia which related to the Inalienable rights of citizens and the provision that nb man shall be deprived of his liberty except by "due process of law." He then made the point that Judge Bahrs had no personal jurisdiction over the case, as it was never legally assigned to him. It was further contended that Judge Bahrs was prejudiced and biased against Durrant. A third objection was based upon the proceedings taken last June ln the Circuit Court when a writ of habeas corpus was asked and refused, the defense making the startling as sumption that the Supreme Court of the United States dismissed the appeal from that order because a writ of habeas cor pus and not a writ of error was de manded. It was Insisted that the Fed i era! Courts have no right to deny the L second writ of habeas corpus applied ■ for or to refuse permission to again ap- L,peal to the Supreme Court of the United ■Hates, on the ground Durrant has a Httatutory and constitutional right to ap ■<eal that no inferior Judge can deny. HLmong other things Attorney Deuprey ■emended in the interest of justice that ■c case be assigned to some other de partment. When the motion was sub- W 'jtted, Judge Bahrs promptly denied At the command of the court, Dur rant then arose, and Judge Bahrs there upon reviewed the proceedings of the ease, and asked the usual question as to whether the defendant had any just cause to offer for further delay of sen tence. At this juncture the attorney again arose and insisted that the court had not Inquired Into the facts, as he had Stated, and, ln short, had done nothing to support him ln his Jurisdiction. While his counsel was speaking, Durrant re • Mimed his east. Attorney Boardman (hen arose and presented the specific ob jections which his conferee had already presented tn a general way. The reading If these consumed some time. When (hey were finally submitted, Judge Bahrs promptly overruled each and all of them. To this ruling, General Dickinson, on behalf of the defendant, took exception. Durrant being again ordered to stand up, the court ordered that no good cause having been shown why the sentence should not be passed upon him, he be delivered by the Sheriff to the Warden at San Quentln, to be hanged by the neck until he is dead, on Friday, January 7th, 189 S. Beyond a slight pale ness, and a rolling of the eyes, Durrant he had heard the Impressive words of betrayed no sign of consciousness that the court. As the condemned man resumed his seat, General Dickinson made another objection, raising the point that under the provisions of the penal code the time for the execution of death sentence cannot be fixed within less than sixty, days, nor more than ninety. But this objection watl also overruled, and the court thereupon adjourned. Shortly after having heard his death sentence pronounced by Judge Bahrs today, Theodore Durrant consented for the first time since his arrest upon the charge of having murdered Blanche La ment and Minnie Williams, to discuss the testimony upon which he was con victed. While sitting In the reporters' room ln the city hnli awaiting the time for his return Journey to San Quentln, Durrant was Interviewed by a press re porter, and reviewed the whole case. While not at all vehement or demon strative, he asserted his innocence and declared his full faith and confidence ln the fact that his guiltlessness will some day be established, In a manner which could not but Impress those who heard him. During the whole conversation, which lasted almost an hour, he re mained perfectly calm and self-pos sessed and manifested not the slightest resentment against those who assisted in sending him to his fate. Speaking of the seven witnesses by whom he was positively Identified In connection with the case, Durrant Insisted that none of them torn the truth, although he was willing to concede that some of them at least were honestly mistaken. He denied emphatically that he either awaited Blanche Lamont on Powell Btreet, or that he saw her at all on the afternoon of April 3. He pointed out many inconsistencies and contradictions ln the evidence for the prosecution, and expressed the opinion that as a matter of Justice these entitled him to a new trial. While admitting that upon the theory of innocence must follow that of some one else's guilt, Durrant declined to tliscußS that phase of the question, be yond saying that it was tho duty of the police to prove who was the guilty per son. He also declined to dlßcuss the matter of the refusal of Rev. George Gibson to listen to his appeal. Durrant's manner indicates that he has little or no hope of prolonging his life; but his attorneys profess the ut most confidence in their ability to stay the execution by another appeal to the supremo court, to which they will press a bill of exceptions founded upon the action of Judge Buhrs In overruling the objections made in court today. Upon this showing they Intend to apply for a writ of probable cause in the near future. ORIENTAL ADVICES A Big Korean Loan—China Not to Be Dismembered VANCOUVER, B.

AUTONOMISTS HANGED NEW YORK, Dec. 15.—A dispatch to the Herald from Havana says: The Cuban leaders In the field are adopting every possible method to prevent even the thin edge of the wedge of autonomy entering their ranks. They not only absolutely refuse to discuss antonomy themselves, but they are determined ln their efforts not to allow Spain's offer of self-government to be laid before the insurgent troops. All emissaries who dare to carry the olive branch to the field are hanged if caught. Seventy-five per cent of the rebel soldiers are kept in ignorance of the liberal terms offered by Spain. There is reason for this reti cence on the part of the Cuban chtefs. There are real rebels and there are sub ordinate rebel officers who are tired of war and its accompanying hardships, and who would lay down arms if liberal home rule were guaranteed. Thef c are not many ot these, it Is true, but, small as the number Is, their desertion would have a far-reaching moral effect. Gen. Gomez and his generals realize this, and hence will tolerate no consid eration of autonomy.

MORE MURDER In Now Famous Emanuel Church District i SOME HORRIBLE FEATURES RECALL THE FAT 3 OF BLANCHE LAM.ONT A Wealthy Woman Outraged and Her Head Beaten to a Jelly With a Coupling Pin — Associated Press Special Wire. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 13.—A horri ble murder was perpetrated here at dusk this evening. The victim was a woman and the scene of the crime wns ln the Mission district, in the vicinity of the Emanuel church murders, about five blocks from that edifice. Many of the features of the crime and its accompany ing circumstances recalled tho tragic deaths of Minnie Williams and Blanche Lamont. It was about 5 oclock this afternoon that the dead body was found ln an upper Hat at 803 Guerero street by the tenants of the lower flat. The woman had been outraged and her head beaten to a Jelly with a coupling pin, which was found in one of the rooms. The victim is supposed to be Mrs. Mary C. Clute, a wealthy resident of Watson ville, Cal. She had Just rented the flat from a Miss Blanchard and the noise of carpet laying was heard by the people In the lower flat. The tacking ceased and all was quiet for a time then terrible screams were heard. The occupants of the lower flat became alarmed and started to Investigate, when they saw a man leaving by an alley way leading to the rear entrance* They asked him the cause of the trouble, but he vouchsafed no reply and made his escape. On going upstairs the dead body was found. The position of the body indicated that the dead woman had been outraged. Joseph Foley, the carpet layer who was working in Mrs. Clute's recently rented flat this afternoon, has been ar rested. He says he went to the flat at 1 oclock, leaving at 5, but asserts that he knows nothing of any murder. Foley was allowed his liberty after being detained at the prison a short time. He seems to know nothing about the case. His assistant, Andrew Jack son, left the house half an hour before Foley departed at 5 oclock. If the po lice have any suspicions they do not di vulge them. No arrests have been made up to midnight. Foley and Jackson are employed by the Chicago Clock company, an "Install ment plan" house. Clute, the husband of the murdered Woman, Is a traveling salesman and is now on the road for a baking powder firm. The lower part of the house where the murder occurred is occupied by L. A. Legg, a horseman. His wife and his aged father, George B. Legg, an in valid, were the only persons who saw the assassin after the consummation of his deadly deed. The elder Legg says he heard the sound of a falling body over head, followed by two or three screams. He went to the front door to summon help. He says: "Just as I and Mrs. Legg reached the front porch a man came out of the small alleyway to the south of the house, the entrance to the rear stair way, and started up the street toward Twenty-first street at a rapid walk. I called to him and asked him what the noise upstairs meant. He made no re sponse, but quickened his steps, and then I called, and asked him again and then a third time, the only result being that when I made the third call he started to run. He did not turn around once, and I could not see his face) at all. He was short and thickset, wore a dark suit of clothing and had black hair." His call for help was responded to by an Italian and C. W. Mark, vice-prin cipal of the Everett school, who went up stairs and found Mrs. Clute lying in a pool of blood. Around her lay several hairpins, and the only evidence of a struggle was the fact that one of the pins was broken in two pieces, and her hair was badly disarranged. Her cloth ing, when Mark arrived on the scene, was nearly drawn up to her knees. A further examination developed that the woman's underclothing was torn to pieces A later examination showed that nothing had been stolen from the apart ments. An examination at the morgue reveal ed the fact that the woman's skull had been fractured by a heavy blow in the region of the left side of the occipital bone. There was a deep cut on the right temple and a slight one over the left eye. Her nose was broken, this proba bly being the spot where she received the first blow, as the ones on the base of the skull would have produced instant unconsciousness. THE 

MURDERED WOMAN WATSONVILLE, Cal., Dec. 15.—Mrs. Mary Clute, who was murdered In San Francisco this evening, was the daugh ter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Ruttles of this place.

AH OAKLAND CRIME Pioneer Murphy Shot by an Unknown Assassin OAKLAND, Dec. 15.—Patrick Murphy, a pioneer resident of Temescal was mur dered by an unknown assassin at 8:15 o'clock tonight. He was shot through the heart as he left his cottage to go to a neighboring store, staggering back into the house and died in the presence of his terrified family. He lacked the strength to utter the name of the man who shot him, if he knew who he was, and the murderer, favored by the isola tion of the locality and the darkness of the night, escaped without difficulty. The police arrived within five minutes after the shooting, but were unable to Supply a motive for the crime or to find a clue. There are no witnesses to the actual shooting. Murphy, who was a street car employe, reached his home at 7 o'clock this even ing. His wife and three children, An tone Glavin, a friend, who makes his home with the Murphys, and Andrew Cunningham, an old acquaintance of the family from Kan Francisco, were there when he arrived, and the entire party took dinner together. About 8 o'clock Murphy went out of the rear door to get some beer. A moment after ho descended the back stairs the report of a gun, fol lowed by groans, was heard. Mrs. Murphy, Glavin and Cunning ham ran to the rear door, and as they reached It, Murphy staggered to the foot of the stairs and fell. They helped him Into the house and placed him on a chair where ho died without uttering a word. There was rw> evidence of a struggle. Henry Smith of 646 Sixth street saw Murphy's slayer fleeing from the scene. He was in an adjoining house, and on hearing the shot rushed to the door ln time to see a man come out of the yard In front of the Murphy home und run rapidly south on Telegraph nvenue. He passed within fifteen feet of Smith, but it was too dark to make out more than his general outline. Smith says he wore a long overcoat and a derby hat and was of medium build. The crime is thus far a mystery which bailies the po lice.
