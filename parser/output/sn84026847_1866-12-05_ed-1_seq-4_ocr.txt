THE FENIANS. lafamatln nkent (kr Frniim Trlnl* ?Mew niusu( Frniim l*ri??urra. &WRKT*nrK<i, 0. K., Dec. 4. ? The court opened at 10 this morning, ami ha* been orcnpiril all day with tlit? trial of o?? Emery Chaml>erlaiii. for murder. j It ai\}ourm'?l at halfpast four, without having finished this case. Mr. Devlin, i?f Montreal, cnium'l fori the Fenian prisoners, arrived here this! mnruiug. Ceneral Arerill, United States Consul Gruersl for liriti**li America, is expected here ki-u?orrow afternoon, to watch the trials on behalf of his government. The Grand Jury had the indictment i>f the Fenian prisoners submitted to tliein at 11 A. M., and were at work on them till C o'clock. They will proluhly make their presentment to-morrow, ami the prisoner** against whom true hills may he found will tlu-n he arraigned. Their counsel is ready to proceed at once with the trials, which it ts believed will commence on Thursday. The whole of Thursday will in all probability be occupied with legal ar gil mentR. It is understood that the prisoners counsel will take exception to thr juris diction of the court, couteuding that tlio provincial courts are not competent to try charge* of high treason. 11" will object also, it is said, to the act under whioh they are to I mi tried, contending that it is" not within the power of a Parliament of a mere dependency of the empire to enact laws defining what shall constitute high treason, and thereby it will be urged that the prisoner* cannot bo tried under ail rx post facto law. The tl'euces were committed in June and the act in its present sham- did not be come a law till the 15th of August, the uct of thu titli of June having been amended and superseded by another subsequently introduced. The prisoners bad a lively time this afternoon. Two of them, Crawford aud Dan Coborn, had a fight in the Fenian ward, aud Coburn, who is a powerfully I built man, punished his antagonist bad ly. They began the fight with fists, ami Coburn finally knocked ilio other down mxl kicked him in the face, dam aging his nose anil nearly knocking out one of his eyes with the toe of his boot. The difficulty, according to the story, arose out of a discussion between the two as to which had rendered the great est service to the Fenian cause. Craw j ford's version of it is tliat the subject ! of dispute was whether the parties who j attempted to kidnap George Sanders were acquitted or not. He says also : that the difficulty was aggravated by a ' reference to an old gambling transac | tion, in which Cobnrn hud lost some money. Cobuni applied to him a very oppriidons epithet, and the fight then began. The gaoler and his assistants having entered the ward, secured Coburn and removed him to a solitary cell in an other part of the gaol, where he will 1m* fed on bread and water and deprived of his allowance of tobacco. Scarcely had the ail'air been disposed of when it was followed by a new ex citement about a quarter of an hour afterwards. The gaoler entered the ward to lock up the prisoners f<* the night. Ho found the door of an inner compartment of the ward shut, and on opening it he discovered one of the prisoners, Thomas Madden, in the very act apparently of attempting to set fire to the gaol. IIe had tilled one of the tin cans, used asacoll'ee cup, with burn ing coal from the stove, and had it set on the floor under the ash pan. The theory is that he wanted to set lire to the tloor, or more probably that he was to cany the coals to his cell and set lire to the bed clothes, in the hope that in tlio confusion caused by an alarm of tire the prisoners might succeed in ! effecting an escape. Madden's story is that he wanted to light his pij>e. Orders have been givfenthat in future two or three policemen shall remain in tl;t> ward with the prisoners, to preserve order and to prevent the repetition of any attempts at incendiarism. All is quiet in the village. There are |very few strangers here from the I'nitcd States. Perhaps there will be more when the trials commence. Meanwhile, the capabilities of i lie neighboring villages to provide board and rooms for the crowd of otlieials, military officers, policemen and others who have been attracted here by the trials, are taxed to the very utmost.
