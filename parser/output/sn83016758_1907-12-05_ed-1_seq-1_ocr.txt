DIGEST OMESSAGE Roosevelt's Annual Document Conser- vative in Tone as Compared With Former flessages. Opening Statement Declares That in No Other Nation Are Business Conditions More Solid. President Roosevelt's message was presented to congress at noon on Tuesday, and as compared with for mer documents of like nature was very conservative in tone. Portions of his previous message relating to crimes against,business were repeated with an evident desire to show that his views are unchanged in those matters. He seeks to impress upon the business world that his policy is to build up and not tear down and that he has no desire to injure the combinations in business life that are of benefit to the public. The message throughout is a calm and equable statement of the presi dent's policies which have been made familiar in his speeches. The princi pal points brought out in the docu ment were as follows: Expresses belief in soundness of business conditions. Favors legislation that will give railroads power to enter into agree ments. Would have Sherman anti-trust law amended so as to permit combi nations beneficial to the public. Railroads should be permitted to increase their capital stock under supervision of the government. Provision should be made for an emergency currency. No changes should be made in the tariff until after the presidential elec tion and the protective system should be retained. Favors income and inheritance tax laws. Preferable to punish the prime offender by imprisonment rather than fine the corporation. Congress should devise some way to limit the abuse of injunctions. A far-reaching employers' liability law should be enacted. Eight-hour law should be extended and compulsory inquiry into labor disputes provided. National system of grain inspection favored. Deep waterway from Great Lakes to mouth of the Mississippi, with branches, favored. Changes in public land laws urged. Tariff on wood pulp should be repealed. Eighty-five feet level lock canal at the isthmus declared the best. Postal savings banks and parcel post extension recommended. Campaign expenses of great politi cal parties might be paid by congress. Higher pay for officers and men of army and navy favored. Building of four battleships should be provided for this year. People of Porto Rico should be granted rights of citizenship. Bureau of mines should be created. Want Railroad Facilities. The farmers of Bradford and Spen cer Brook in Isanti county are at tempting to stir up interest in a rail road project, and at a mass meeting held in the former town the other evening committees were appointed to confer with the business men and farmers of St. Francis and neighbor ing towns. In the course of time a railroad may intersect the territory lying between the Princeton and Cam bridge branches of the Great Northernthe Soo or some other road may want a direct connection between Duluth and Superior and St. Paul and Minneapolis. But just at present the prospects for building new lines of railroad are not very encour aging. If the Soo completes its Brooten and Duluth branch next year it will do well. Princeton Potato market The tone of the market is a trifle stronger this week in consequence of the awakening of an outside demand, but this demand has not been heavy. However, the adjustment of the finan cial situation is expected to bring about better conditionsto create a heavier demand from the large market centers. Small quantities of potatoes are being brought in daily, but many of the farmers are holding for better prices. Shipments from this point are slightly on the increase, and at this time there appears to be a sufficient number of cars for all pur poses. Prices have not changed materially from those prevailing last week. A Social Gathering. Mrs. Alfred Munz on Friday after noon entertained a number of ladies who proceeded to her home for the purpose of surprising her, but some how or other Mrs. Munz had received intimation that they were coming and prepared a delicious lnucheon in anticipation thereof. It was really an event where the "surprisers" were surprised, for they had taken with them an abundance of dainty re freshments. Nevertheless the after noon was delightfully passed in social enjoyment and the luncheon proved to be a double onea sort of two course affair. Mrs. Munz was pre sented with an artistically arranged nosegay of carnations. Those present at the gathering were Mesdames W. H. Ferrell, P. L. Road strom, L. G. Prescott, F. L. Small, E. M. Chapman, J. W. Hartman, H. C. Cooney, E. E. Whitney, L. S. Briggs and C. O. Moore. 

FIREMAN HENDRICKS KILLED. Death Caused by Collision Between a Pass enger Train and Freight Transfer. The delay in the arrival of Satur day morning's passenger train at this place was occasioned by its collision with the rear end of a freight trans fer half a mile north of the Northern Pacific depot in South Superior at 6:30 a. m. J. C. Hendricks, fireman on the Great Northern passenger train, while in the act of jumping from his engine, was struck by the baggage car and received injuries from which he died within a few minutes. Engineer Watson of the same train, who jumped simultaneously with Hendricks, es caped with but a slight injury to one of his legs. When the passenger train collided with the freight transfer the latter was on its way with a string of cars loaded with wheat bound to the east end elevators and mills. The engine of the passenger train was reduced to a scrap heap while a couple of cars in the transfer train were demolished and wheat was spread about the rail road yards. The baggage car was but slightly damaged. The wreck is said to have been due to the negligence of some one in not putting out a flagman. The transfer had left the south side a few minutes ahead of the time the passenger train was due. It had gone but a short dis tance when it broke in two, leaving several cars standing on the main line. It was still dark when the passenger train came thundering along at a speed of 30 miles an hour. It is said that there was no flagman out or lights on the rear car of the transfer to give warning and before the crew of the passenger train realized what was up they were about to crash into the freight cars. Throwing on the emergency brake, Engineer Watson shouted to his fire man to jump. The enginemen emerged from their respective sides of the locomotive. Hendricks had struck the ground when the impact from the collision swung the baggage car to one side, striking him. The passengers were given a severe shak ing up and for a time it appeared that several of the women passengers would go into hysterics. None, how ever, was injured and save for a couple of the ladies declining to con tinue their journey and a couple more suffering to some extent _from the fright of the shock, the passengers were soon calmed. Road Master Mungavin of the Northern Pacific was on the scene and with a crew of men cleared up the wreck so as to enable the passenger train to proceed to St. Paul with but an hour's delay. The regular Great Northern wrecking outfit arrived about 9 o'cock and soon cleared away the debris of the wrecked engine and cars. Engineer Watson, with another engine, took the passenger train to St. Paul. Watson and Hendricks had been on the St. Paul run for some time, both being residents of that city. Henricks was only 24 years of age. His remains were taken to St. Paul on Saturday night for burial. New Paper at Wahknn. Number one volume one of the Wahkon Enterprise has reached the Union office. It is a six-column quarto and four of its pages are home print. The paper presents a neat ap pearance and makes a fair showing of advertisements. Its publisher, Mr. George E. Sloan, is an old newspaper man and appears to take an optimis tic view of things. The Enterprise makes the third newspaper in the Mille Lacs lake region. There may be room for three newspapers in that ter ritory, but, for a time at least, it will be hard sledding for some of the boys. From what we know of Mr. Sloan through his friends in Big Stone county he will publish a clean news paper and will not needlessly antag onize any one. B.C. 

DUNN, Publisher. Terms $1.00 Per Year. PRINCETON, MILLE LACS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1907. THE COUNTY BOARD Commissioners ileet on Tuesday in Adjourned Session and Com- plete Work Same Day. Attorney McHilian Engaged to Assist County Attorney Joseph A. Ross in Tax Case. Mille Lacs board of county commis sioners met in adjourned session on Tuesday with L. S. Libby, C. E. Erickson, O. H. Uglem and T. E. Potts present. Chairman Dalchow was absent in consequence of having made a mistake in date of meeting. The business which came up for con sideration was very light and con sumed only a portion of the day. There was, however, one matter of considerable importance to the county which was taken up at this session, viz., the tax case of Alberta E. Plondke and Elizabeth M. Bartosch vs. The County of Mille Lacs and E. E. Whitney, county auditor. This case was heard at the last term of the district court and recently decided by Judge Myron D. Taylor in favor of the plaintiffs. Not being satisfied with the decision so rendered the com missioners on Tuesday decided to have the evidence in the case thor oughly reviewed, and to this end en gaged Attorney E. L. McMillan to assist County Attorney Ross. A transcript of the testimony in the case will be secured and carefully exam ined. A new trial may be asked for or an appeal to the higher court taken. The sum of about $2,000 is involved in this tax suit, and the county cer tainly does not want to lose that amount if it can possibly be avoided. The liquor license bond of Olts & Logering, New Onamia, was received and approved. An auctioneer's license was granted to S. R. Perkins of Milaca. The board authorized the county treasurer to accept $11.68 in full satis faction of the delinquent personal property tax, penalty and costs due from Robert Hanson of Milaca for the year 1906. This amounts to about one half of such tax and penalty. With the exception of passing upon a number of bills the above virtually comprised the business performed by the board. BIG MASS MEETING. Special Services With Special Music on Sunday Next, December 8. Something on a really big scale is planned for Princeton. We have man aged to secure Mr. Edwin W. Peck, state secretary of the Y. M. C. A., apd Mr. E. W. Cross, superintendent of the college work, for Sunday, De cember 8. A meeting for men only will be held in the Congregational church at 3 p. m. In the evening there will be a union of all the churches in the Meth odist church. Mr. Peck and Mr. Cross will speak at both meetings and the male quartet will sing. There will be a grand chorus of all the singers in the evening. These meetings are free. No special money raisingjust the orainary col lection to pay expenses. Now, we want the people! Men in the afternoon, old and young and boys. Everybody in the eveningthe sinners who do not go to church and those who do. We will pack the churches at both services. Geo. Swertfager, J. W. Heard, Chas. E. Kopp, Committee. Star Entertainment Conign. But fifty persons were in the audi ence which gathered at the Methodist church on Tuesday evening to listen to that famous lecturer, James Hoff man Batten. Mr. Batten certainly deserved a full house for his lecture was truly magnificent. He is an ora tor of the finest order and his address bristled with humor, pathos, inspira tion and instruction. The small audi ence was enrapt from beginning to end. It was the best entertainment so far in the Star course and it is to be deplored that it was not more liber ally patronized. Methodists' Annual Sale. Wednesday, December 11, the Ladies' Aid of the Methodist church will hold their annual sale or fair in the church parlors, ^rad they will serve one of their usual good suppers in the basement of the church. Bring your friends and have a good supper. Every one is cordially invited to come. Supper will be served from 5:30 to eight or till every one is served. A fish pond will be provided for the children. This will be a good time to buy some pretty as well as useful Christmas presents. Do not forget the date, December 11. DOMINICANJATHERS Are Holding Week's Mission Services at St. Edwards Catholic Church in Village of Princeton. Learned Divines Elucidate Truths of the Gospel and Exhort People to Lead Better Lives. But seldom are the residents of Princeton and vicinity afforded an opportunity of listening to so learned and eloquent gentlemen as the Domin ican fathers, Revs. S. R. Brockbank and J. M. Eckert, both of Minneapo lis, who are this week conducting a mission at St. Edwards Catholic church. People of mixed religious denominations have filled St. Ed wards to overflowing at every service held and well have they been repaid for the time expended. From every quarter comes words of eulogy for Rev. Fathers Brockbank and Eckert, and they are fully entitled to this praise for their logical elucidation of the various subjects upon which they discourse. Forceful and impressive are the words of these learned divines, and to such an extent are their exhorta tions taken to heart that at times the audience, from the strongest man to the weakest woman, are convulsed in tears. The advice of the Dominican fathers is of the soundest, and were we to live up to their teachings we could do nothing that is wrong. If you have not attended one of these mission services you should do soyou will be better therefor. The mission will be in progress until Sun day next, December 8. Among the visiting priests who were here this week and took part in the services were the Very Rev. Father Kitowski of Foley and Rev. Father Gans of Alexandria. Rev. Father Levings is in charge of the mission. Of Interest to Teachers. The books for the Reading circle work are in use in every county in Minnesota and the law provides that the county superintendent shall use every effort to have the teachers in his county purchase those books. Therefore I repeat my request of last week that you get one, two or all three of these books and read them, if possible, before the next examination. They are all helpful. You may send to this office for them or direct to the publishers. Suit your convenience as to that. All the schools of the county are now in session. They are in general supplied with a fine class of teachers and the attendance is above that of last year. Boards are fully alive to what is needed for the comfort and welfare of their children and they are putting in good heating and ventilat ing plants in all parts of the county. The board convention will probably be held in January, 1908, and at the same time a session of the Teachers' association will be called. I shall have some leading men and women here as speakers and singers. The notices for the next teachers' examination have not been received, but the dates are fixed for January 30, 31, and February 1, 1908. I shall hold examinations in Princeton, Mil aca and Onamia. I have in this office the new school laws, 1907, for distribution. Clerks will please call for them when in town. They are free this year to all district clerks. I have now on hand all the neces sary blanks except teachers' term re ports. Clerks and teachers should see that the report in the register is completed at the holiday vacation. If teachers receive no term report blank before that vacation the register report will answer the purpose, so that teachers may draw their last month's pay. Let me close by asking you again to get into the Reading circle work without delay, and though no meeting will be called for some weeks in this work, you can get the sense of the Reading circle books in the mean time. Guy Ewing, County Supt. A Former Resident of Princeton Dead. Mrs. Ira Hults, a former resident of Princeton, died at Foster, Wash., on the 14th ult. Deceased's maiden name was Elizabeth Jacobs. She was born at Norwalk, Ohio, August 23, 1850, and was married to Ira Hults at Morristown, this state, October 17, 1866. Her husband and six children survive her. The Northern Produce Company. The branch warehouse of the North ern Produce company at this place is under the management of F. W. Good win of Spencer Brook and that gentle man commenced purchasing potatoes on November 26. The warehouse is on the site of the old Dalbo building and has been rented from Louis Lar son. Its capacity is about 15,000 bushels and it was built and equipped especially for the storage of potatoes. The headquarters of the Northern Produce company is at Cambridge and Peter Dahlman is its general manager. This company, in which there are several hundred sharehold ers, was organized last year, and so encouraging has its business been that it now has branches at Stanch field, Granby, Isanti and Prinecton. Mr. Goodwin, manager of the Princeton branch, says it is not the intention of his company to bull the market, but it will pay prevailing prices for potatoes. So far Mr. Goodwin has taken in at this point about 3,000 bushels and shipped four 

GAME FORFEITED. Monticellos Fall to Appear and Princetons Chalk Up Six Points To many the failure of the Thanks giving day football game to material ize was a disappointment. The Princeton boys were prepared for and awaited the fray, but the Monticellos weakened and failed to show up. Hence, by the rules of football, the game was forfeited and the Prince tons chalked up a score of 6 to 0that is, six for themselves and a goose egg for Monticello. As this game was to decide the supremacy of the two teams there would doubtless have been a record breaking attendance with its conse quential heavy gate receipts, and the Princeton eleven are justified in cher ishing a certain amount of animosity toward the team that failed to live up to its promise. It appears to be a pure case of "We are afraid of you" with the Monticellos, however, but such breach of football etiquette as that of which they are guilty is not soon forgotten and will probably result in their being unable to secure a contest with the Princetons for years to come. Had the Monticellos apprised Coach Whitney that they were not coming he could readily have secured a Minneapolis team to push the pig skin against his aggregation, but they were as mum as a bivalve and he naturally expected them to appear. Under the management of Jesse Angstman the Princeton high school football team has played more games than at any previous season and has prospered financially. Coach Whit ney and Captain Roos are also en titled to a share of the laurels for the active interest which they have mani fested and the good work performed in this, the banner of all football seasons for Princeton's high school football eleven. This Year's Crop. Bradstreet's have issued their annual Thanksgiving estimate of the nation's crop yield, and it affords, when prices are considered with it, plenty of occasion for thankfulness, even though nearly all of the yields are lower than those of last year. This was expected, because the spring season was backward and unfavor able. Yet the decreases are relative ly small, and they are more than off set by increased prices. In six lead ing cereals the crop is 15 per cent smaller than last year, but the prices have run from 11 to 40 per cent higher. While wheat production is 14.9 per cent lower than last year's, the price of wheat was 22 per cent higher last week than it was last year at the same time. Corn production decreased 12.7 per cent, but the price is 18 per cent higher. "Taken as a whole," says Bradstreet's, '-this year's cereal crops will yield fully as much if not more than they aid a year ago." And some crops yielded more large ly than last year. Hay, a crop whose value was exceeded only by corn and cotton in 1906, gained 6 per cent over last year: rice gained 20.2 per cent and sugar 9 per cent. Furthermore, while the yields are generally smaller than last year, they are not greatly lower than those of the record years, hence they are above the average. Corn decreased 12.7 per cent from last year, yet last year?s crop was the record, and the same is true of winter wheat, which lost 17 per cent from last year. It is hard to be pessimistic in the face of such figures impossible, in deed, without being at the same time foohslh and illogical.Duluth Herald. Wreck on the Cambridge Line. A wreck on the Cambridge line this morning somewhere between Coon Creek junction and Cambridge neces sitated the sending of the night train from Duluth and the morning train from St. Paul over the Princeton branch. The night train went south at 10 a. m., and the northward bound train passed our regular train at Brickton at 11:15 a. m. VOLUME XXXI.

Within a few days, as soon as the necessary requirements can be com plied with, the Farmers State Bank of Milaca will be converted into a national bank and will be known as the First National Bank of Milaca. The new institution will have a paid up capital of $25,000, and its stock holders will include such well known and highly respected citizens as George H. Deans of Foreston, M. K. Rudd of Milaca, T. H. Caley and Aulger Rines of Princeton, in addition to those already identified with the Farmers bank. The officers of the First National will be Chas. Keith, president M. K. Rudd, vice presi dent J. A. Allen, cashier C. H. Dahlstrom, assistant cashier. The stockholders and officers are all good substantial residents of the county, and the Times is right when it says in the First National "Milaca can boast of the largest and strongest banking institution in this section." Northwestern Hospital. Brent Strom beck of Estes Brook was operated upon by Di. Cooney on Thursday of last week for appendi citis. The patient is doing well. H. C. Harris of Evergreen, Wis., came to the hospital yesterday for the purpose of having a plaster cast renewed. Mr. Harris is suffering from a disease of the knee joint and has been treated by Dr. Cooney for the past three months. He has been an invalid for more than a year, but he is slowly improving and Dr. Cooney has hopes of eventually effecting a cure. ___^_ Necessary Fire Protection. It was a wise move on the part of the village council to lay a water main from First street to the flour mill. There is a great deal of prop erty in that vicinitythe flour mill, elevators and warehousesthat have had no fire protection whatever here tofore. Besides there are quite a number of private residences that can also be served with city water and have the benefit of fire protection as well. XI i *4
