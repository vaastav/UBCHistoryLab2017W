HARRIMAN VICTORY. Interstate Commerce Commission Is Not Baffled. AVashlngton, Dee. 15. Members of he interstate commerce commission .aid today that the decision of 1 lie United States supreme court in the ;ase of E. H. Harriman and Otto Kahn would prove an empty victory to Mr. Harriman. It is not felt by the comnilssion'that the decision will affect seriously" its powers of railroad regulation, inas much as the questions propounded to Mr. Harriman and to Mr. Kahn did Hot affect materially the determination of the so called "Harriman cases." Chairman Knapp of the commission said that the decision could not de tract in any material way from the powers of the commission In the mak ing of future Investigations regarding railway transactions. This opinion was concurred in by other members of the commission. The opinion justified the refusal of Messrs. Harriman and Kahn to make reply to questions put by the commis sion in the course of an inquiry con cerning the dealings of Mr. Harriman ss president of the T'nion Pacific in ihe stocks of other railroad companies, many of which are competing lines. In a dissenting opinion, concurred in by Justices Harlan and McKenna. Jus tice Day declared that the effect of (he opinion of the majority of the ,'ourt would be to materially narrow the scope of the interstate commerce law.

Arnst of New Zealand, to-day won the sculling championship of the world NO BLOCKADE YET Washington, Dec 15. The exist ence of what amounts practically to a state of war between Holland and Venezuela, the absence for the first time in many years in an acute crisis of this kind of American warships from the proper sphere of influence, and the profession by the state de partment officials of their Ignorance of the intention of Holland, constl tues a most curious and Interesting International situation. The fact that America has a quarrel of her own with Venezuela and has termi nated diplomatic relations with that country, gives rise to doubt as to the accuracy of the statement that (hit) government is not interested in what is going on off the coast of Venezue la. Indeed there is reason to believe that while the official records may fail to show the existence of any for mal agreement between America and the Netherlands, the government, of the latter country is proceeding with the tacit consent of America to bring to an end the chaotic conditions that have prevailed in an internation al sense in Venezuela for the past two years. So long as the Dutch ships act strictly within the lines cf the Monroe doctrine, as construed in the annual message to congress of President. Roosevelt last year; so long as no attempt is made to seize Venezuelan territory for permanent ocupation, there probably will be no interference on the part of the United States government. Logical ly the next step will be the declara tion of a blockade and of this due notice must be given by Holland to all maritime nations in order to pre vent the lodgement of claims for un warrantable injury inflicted upon neutral commerce.

In a special despatch to The Tele gram from Detroit. t. is stated that gram from Detroit it is stated that in that city, but had given them up and disappeared. From other sources the information comes that these officers were in close proxi mity to those of Mr Mabie, who has conducted such vigorous warfare against the anii-saioon league.
