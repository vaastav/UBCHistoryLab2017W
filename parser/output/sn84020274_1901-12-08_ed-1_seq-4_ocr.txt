Revision Prepared by English Scholars Shows That To-Day's English Was Xot Freely Used in Old Text. Ministers and Bible Ftudcnts In ceneral are Intensely Interested In the Twentieth Century New- Testament. They have been eagerly nought and read with much care. One prominent preacher thought so much of the first book that he had It bound In rare leather. The new revision was prepared by emi nent English scholars and published by a Chicago book concern. When the first rart wan placed on sale the J,nndon Evening News, becoming critical, accused "twenty mlsgulded inhabitants of Chicago"' of hand ling the work. Therefore, the paper i-tatcd, even the masterpiece of literature was not sacred in the Windy City. Few criticisms have been heard, however. A well-known Bible student has made the following state ment In regard to the new text: "I have in my study at all times several translations of the New Testament Into English. Tliis is by long odds the best. Its market value Is found chltfiy In two feat ures. "First, it conveys the exact meaning of the best original Greek text In English. It is In no sense a paraphrase, but a true translation. convelng the thought of the original without addition or subtraction. "Its second great merit is that it does this in fluent as well as current English. Some of the other translations are good, but in cumbersome phraseology. This Is In no sense a revision of the version of ''(.' rptin urn Tf la n moo.' tranclntfnn "If one desires simply a revision of the antique version, known as iving james . being attached Immovably to the ancient phrases, he can find this to best advantage in the recently published American Stan dard Revised Version. "So many people are conservative to the last degree about phrases used in religious matters that nothing more radical than this extremely conservative revision is likely to be widely used In public It w 111 undoubted ly be the standard, at least during the first ruJf of the Twentieth Century- "But for those who care more for the thought of the biblical writers than for an cient English phrases, the Twentieth Cen tury New Testament will be heartily wel comed. Though sticking in the closest way possible to the original thought by putting It Into present everyday English, it makes It seem like a new story. "1 he Gospels es pecially are fascinating in this form." Hare are a few comparisons which will illustrate the difference in styles of the old and latest versions: St. Matthew, v. SO 42. 

KOSERK ENGLISH. Too hSTa hemrd that It was said. "An ere for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." I, however, tali you not to resist a man who injures you. But If any one strikes one of you on the right cheek, turn the other to him. too; and wben any one wants t- go to law with you i-nd get your coat, let him take Jour cloak as well; and t any one forces you to go one mile, go two miles with him. Give to those that ask of you. and when people want to borrow from you. do not ram away from them. St. Matthew MODERN ENGLISH. ' So when you distrib ute charity do not havs a trumpet blown In front of you. as hy pocrites do In the ayna gocues and In the treats, that they may be praised by other men. That, believe me. la all their recom pense! But when you are (lrUuf tn charity do ot let your left hand bow what your right hand is doing, so that your charities may be fa secret; and then your gainer, who sees what la dons In secret, will rexar you. TM Acts II, 14 ll, OLD VERSION. But 1 say unto you. that ye resist not li: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right (.heck, turn to bim the other also. And If any rue the at the law. and take away thy coat, let hun hae thy cloak also. And whoeoever ahall compel the to go a mile, go with him twain. Gle to him thataak cth thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. v, a i. OLD VERKIOM. Therefore. when thou doeet thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do In the synagogues and In the streets, that they may hare glory of men. Verily I ay un to you, they have their reward. But when thou doeat aim, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth. That thine almi may he In secret: and thy Father which aeeth In cecret himself shall re ward thee openly. MODERN ENGLISH. Then Peter, surround ed by the eleven other apostles, ttood up, and, raising his voice, ad dressed the crowd. "Men ef Judea," he be gan, "and all you who are staying In Jeruaa em. let me tell you what this means, and mark my wordi. You are wrong In thinking that these men are drunk: Indeed, It la only in thA morning." From one of Paul'B writings concerning1 women: OLD VERSION. But Peter, standing up with the eleven, tut ea up hla voice and said unto them: Ts men of Judea. and all ye that dwell In Jerusalem, be this known unto you. and hearken to my word: For these sre not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing It Is but the third hour of the day. OLD VERSION. In like manner also, that women adorn them eelra In modest appar el with ahamefacedne and aobriety; not with braided hair or gold or pearls or cortly array. But which becometh women professing god liness with good works. Let the women learn In silence with all sub jection. But I suffer not wo men to teach, not to usurp authority over the man. but to bo In silence. MODBRX ENGLISH. I also desire that wo men should roaae mem selves attractive by their discreet, quiet and modest dresa. They should not Indulge in wreaths or gold orna ments for their hair or In pearls or In expen sive clothes, but as is proper for women who profess to be religions, they sheold make them selves attractive by their good actions. Wo men should listen to their teachern and al ways show them defer ence. I do not consent to women becoming teachers or exercising authority oer men; they ought to be quiet.

A street sweeper, occupy ing a garret in the Rue des Saints Peres, re turned to find that he had been burned out.

Derby Conference Agrees on Important Line of Action for Ending Hostilities, Granting Certain Terms to Boers and .Creating Need ed Reforms in British Army Methods. TREATMENT OF MISS H0BH0USE CONDEMNS MARTIAL LAW. BT HERBERT PAUU SPECIAL BT CABLE. Hondon, Dec. ".Those Liberals who have always been opponents of Mr. Chamber lain's policy are very well pleased with the result of the Liberal conference at Der by on Wednesday. It is not that all the delegates then and there assembled agree about the origin of the war. Very likely they disagree, .but that Is now a historical question. They have, however, done tour things, of which the last is by far -the most Impor tant They have condemned the concentration camps. They protested against martial law. They expressed confidence la Sir t Henry Campbell-Bannerman. And they resolved that a special Com mlsslocer should be sent to South Africa, an Lord Durham was sent to Canada more than sixty years ago, with full powers of negotiating and concluding peace. Definite Line of Action. Of course, this last step will not be taken. The opposition cannot govern the coun try, but at last we have a definite line of action upon which the Liberal party may unite. t ''. The body which affirmed these things Is the General Committee of the National Lib eral Federation. It Is thoroughly representative, being elected by the Liberal associations In all the English constituencies. The federation itself meets early In the 'year, chiefly for the purpose of listening to speeches for the motions then proposed that have been previously settled by the commit tee and cannot be amended. They may be rejected, but, of course they never an. The Times attacks the Liberal Imperial Ms for not golne to Derby and surnort Ing their views, but that is most unfair. They could not go unless they were elected, and there is no reason to suppose that any who were elected stayed away. The further remark of the same raper that they constitute the bulk of the party !s, therefore, a palpable delusion. Question Ha Changed. The principal speaker at the meeting was Mr. Augustine Blrrell, who has always held that President Kruger was responsll for the war. We are a long way from the time when that was a burning' question. It was so, no doubt. In October, 1S99. but in December, 1901, we have to consider not how the war began, but how it mny be ended. Liberals are tired of having Lord Milner always thrown In their teeth. He la not one of themselves, and they see no reason why they should uphold him if they think him an obstacle to peace. It is said on pretty good authority that the proclamation of marital law in Cape Colony, or. at all events, in Cape Town, was forced upon the Government by the High Commissioner, who threatened to resign If It was not made. The Cabinet may have been afraid of provoking the war party at the Cape by accepting his resignation, but that is no reason why Liberals who do not believe in martial law for civilians while the ordi nary courts are open should take sides with the High Commissioners against prin ciples which they have professed ever since the days of Governor Eyre. Liberal members who have been visiting their constituents say that a great change of opinion is apparent, and that many men who a year ago were for fighting to a fin ish, are now earnestly in favor of an arm istice and negotiations. 

BRITONS PROUD OF POPULARITY OF IRVING AND LIPT0N IN AMERICA. mcuviB Think It a True Index of the Feeling of Good Will Among the Two Nations Irving Holds a Peculiar Position. SPECIAL BY CABLE. London, Dec. ".The great popularity of Sir Henry Irving and Sir Thomas Upton in America has been cited by many writ ers in the English press an showing' the cordial feeling existing between the peopls of England and America. Mr. J. C. Parkinson, writing In the Christ mas number of the World, sas: "Sir Henry Irving's relations with the United States of America are absolutely unique. No Englishman, not to say no English artist, has ever filled, and I will venture to say. ever will All. the peculiar place he occupies In the sympathies and affections of the great American people, who, as It appears to me, have come to regard him as one of themselves, bound to them by long-standing ties of personal lik ing and intellectual sympathy." Mr. Parkinson, speaking of his recent visit to New York, continues: "There were important men, some of them men of first Importance In their coun try, who maintained that Irving had been a distinct factor In upholding and main taining the present happy and cordial feel ing between the States and the mother country. " 'At the time he visited us first,' said one distinguished speaker, 'there was a deeldcd Inclination here to twist the Lion's tall. If that has not disappeared entirely, it has become a vanishing quality. " 'And. just as Sir Thomas Upton's genial personality and sportsmanlike de meanor .under defeat hove recently helped to Increace the popularity of Englishmen on this side. so. I am confident. Irving's visits and the broad, admiring sympathy and personal affection he has inspired among our people, have done much, over a long series of years, to make your coun trymen popular with ours.' " j among Liberals to which they have long wren aiCBHKCia. The treatment of Miss Hobhouse, scribed in her own moderate words. companled by the temperate protest of uncle. Lord Hobhouse, the venerable and distinguished lawyer, gave point and zest to the delegates' condemnation of martial law. Liberals do not like, and I doubt whether many Conservatives like, to see the re sources of the British Empire directed against an English lady traveling alone on an errand of charity and mercy. South Africa Is not the British Empire, nor Is the Transvaal South Africa. What these converts feel. I take It, Is that Ministers are committed to a policy of unconditional surrender which may take years to enforce, and will not then produce a lasting peace. If. on the other hand, peace Is concluded by negotiations, thousands of lives wouW be saved. The Boers would give up all Idea of fight ing again, the Cape Dutch would cease to be disaffected, and British supremacy in South Africa would be secure. The name ot the Liberal leader was re ceived by the delegates with Intense en thusiasm. 8ir 'Henry Campbell-Bannerman does not pleas his political opponents; but he has kindled the spirit of hope and confidence Cures Rheumatism k 50
