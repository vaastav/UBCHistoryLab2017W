The tariff conference of la* summer bat already born fruit in two note worthy utterance* by men holding distinguished positions in public life. Mr. Carlisle's speech in accepting his election to tbe s;ieakershlp was m plain statement that tbe business before tbe House i his session was to revise tbe tax laws and to prevent tbe further accumu lation of a dangerous surplus In tlie Treasury. Yasterday congress received from the President hi* aanuil message, which la devoted almost ex r.isaively to a discussion of the tax question. This Indicate* that the President and the speaker are in aconl on this subject, and fully aroused to the necessity of prompt and vigorous action on the part <c congress to relieve the threatened strin gency in th? money market. The Speaker, by a pleasant Act ion. Is supposed to require time enough, after his election, to get per sonally acquainted with tbe Kcpresentatlvee be tore apportioning them among tbe committees: but, of course, Mr. CarUlse knew that he was going to be the Speaker of the present Mouse long before he was called to the chair, and tbe leading mem ber* of the several cuiauiiiu-es are always se lected from the older representatives, with wboti: the Speaker Is already acquainted while the newer ones are used merely to pad oat the lists, llence it Is probable that with one or two exceptions, Mr. Carlisle ha* already settled In his mind, pretty definitely, the committee status of each of his associates In the House. There is no reaaon why the committee appointments should not be published early m the session and tbe House enabled to get well to work before the holiday s. At all events, even If nothing more were done for the present, the same plan mlgh: be pursued this year aa was followed at the beginning of the Forty-ninth Congress, when tbe committee on rules was named at the outset, and the time occupied by the debate on Its report was used with good effect by the Speaker In making out the composition of the other committees. The rule which It Is proposed to revive could be re ported by the committee and got out of the way, and the path would then be clear for the Introduc tion of b usines* legislation, which the country so much needs. The Mew Tort .Vun enters a very proper protest again* changing the color of the two cent pontage stamps f-om brown to green, and takes tbe ground that neither Mr. Dickinson nor any other man ahouM be confirmed as Postmaster General with out first pledging himself to abolish the green and restore the old color. The Sun is undoubtedly correct as to tbe matter of taste Involved; bat It dor* not go far enough. The (act la, the power to change at will the design and color of the postage stamps should be wholly taken away from tbe post office department. Congress ought to ap point a permanent art commission to whom should be committed tbe duty of fixing the design and color not of postage stamps alone, but of all 1'hlted states currency notes, bonds and securi ties of every character, and also the size, device, etc., of its coins, ot whatever value. At present the appearance of government Issues ot all kinds seems to be at the mercy of lmresponstble subor dinates In official power, for the time being, who as a rule hare no qualifications whatever for that duty. The result Is not only confusing, on ac count of th? great variety In form, size, color Ac., put positively discreditable to the country In an esthetic point of view. They manage these things better, not only In France, but in nearly every civ ilized Country In the world. The plumbers who questioned the power Of the commissioners to make and enforce the new plumb ing regulations. requiring with other things the prellmlaary examination and licensing of plumbers wishing to ply their trade in the District, and oft. ject?-l u> certain parts of the regulations as op pressive, have come out ahead In the legal contest. It to dedded that present provisions of law do not authorize the commissioners to provide such safe guard* for the public. As the exclusive power la in con grew to furnish to the people of Washington that full protection against the evils of defective plumbing which modern investigation shows to be a necessity. It is hoped that our legislative body wtll Interest Itself In the matter. While the public Is not disposed to inflict petty annoyances and re strictions upon our plum ben, it is in the highest degree desirable that every reasonable precaution be taken to avoid the recognized das.'ers from de fective material and Incompetent workmen. The very nature of the plumbers' work furnishes the opportunity and excuse for public supervision, and In the interest of the District the opportunity of fer*) in the present case should not be neglected by congress. Considerable excitement was caused In New Tort yesterday by the circulation of a report that Katie Metz, the servant whose testimony played so important a part in the prosecution of the Doodle aldermen by showing who were admitted to attend tbe meetings of the "combine," had been Induced to go to Kurope and keep out of the way of subpoenas for a while. The story Is set at rest, however, as far as the woman's present where abouts are concerned, by a statement ot a reporter of the World that he saw and talked with her last evening, since the defeat of DeLancey Nleoll, tbe offer of tbe Assistant District,Attorneyship to one ot Jacob Sharp's leading counsel, and the decision of the court or appeals in the Sharp case Itself, it Is doubtful whether the untried boodlers still re mainlcg in New York would be in a hurry to pay the expenses of a tour abroad for any witness however dangerous to their cause under tbe old conditions. There are other and easier ways of getting out of trouble, and the increase ot expen ses would be money thrown away. Tbe character of the President's message sug gests the strong probability that there will be a live aad recognized issue between the political parties la tbe next presidential campaign. A square fight over an important qu stion or political economy, which will set tie something when ended, is much to be <1e*ir?d. The movement of a part of the conservatives in England towards protection promises a lively political contest across the water, and the democratic movement away from protection in this country will lead to aa even more netting aad Interesting contest. These is occasionally a consoling feature to be found in the business barriers which have grown up between Canada and the I nlted States since Mr John Macdoaald's tariff went into operation. The panic which has threatened tbe Dominion ?lace the failure of tbe Central Bank of Toronto has not mad* itself felt to say extent on this side of tbe border exi-ept among the direct correspon dents of the suspended bank. Had the commer cial relations between the two countries been more intimate and tbe balance of trade as largely In our favor, aa It would naturally bare been without the tariff, we ot tbe United States could hardly nave escaped a shock. The appointment, by tbe United states Marshal at Trenton, 9.J., of his daughter to serve as bis deputy aad sign all papers in his name. Is treated by the newagatberen as a remarkable thing?not because the Marshal placed bis appointment within tbe circle of his own family, but because the person chosen to be thus honored was a wo rn in. Those who marvel at this incident fall to recall the case of ptuebe couzena, who was gal lantly appointed to the full om -e of marshal by one of the Justices of the Supreme court, but removed by President Cleveland to make room lor a big. bold man.
