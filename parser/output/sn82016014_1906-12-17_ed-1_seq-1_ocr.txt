Plans have been perfected by the Missouri Pacific Railway company to make Topeka one of the most im portant cities on any of its lines In this particular part of the country. For many years Topekans have been wont to look on the relations of the Missouri Purine to the city a- a sur: of a joke. Its !i:,e from Fort Scott, which tnJs he?e. has seemed to be the jumping off place for the road and few persona have had any ide. that it would be anything more than that for a long Lime to come. But before long the Missouri Pacific wiil beg-in active work on the construc tion of a north and south line from frmiha to the gulf ports and Topeka will be the central point on this line in Kansas, or in fact between Omaha and Coffeyville. It will probably be made a division operating point, where a round house and perhaps repair shops will be built, and this will mean a con siderable Increase In the population of the town. It will aJso mean that To peka will be the one big city in the Mate to first get on the line of a real north and south road in this section of the country and the advantages that the city will gain thereby are hard to calculate. It has been known for some time that the Misouri Pacific-was planning to build a new and modern passenger and freight depot here and that land had been bought for thi9 purpose and when the announcement of these plans had been made a good many people wondered why such a station would be necessary. But with the knowledge of the fact that the plans for the north and south line have been decided upon with Topeka as its central point the necessity for these facilities is seen at a glance . To set this north and south line into the city it will be necessary to con struct a bridge across the Kaw and plans for this bridse have already been drawn. It will cross the river to the west of the Santa Fe bridge. One of the engineers of the Missouri Pa cific was in the city for two or three days last week and looked over for a second or third time the situation in Js'crth Topeka and made his plans for the route through that locality to the north. B'TdUse of the network of lines that the Missouri Pacific has in the state a great amount of new construc tion work will not be necessary to make this north and south line a reality. It is going to be built for the purpose of giving the road a more di rect line than it now has to the gulf ports, which, it is recognized, will in the near future become the grain ex port ports of this country. All of the east and west lines have their plans making now to get straight lines from the wheit and grain centers to the gulf end the Missouri Pacific's plans are complete. This proposed north and south line will furnish a direct outlet to the gulf for all the traffic in grain and live stock which the com pany handles over its Central Branch and other of its lines in Kansas and Nebraska. Under the present condition ell of the gulf traffic of the company from Omaha and from western Kansas has to be hauled around through Atchison and Kansas City and then down in a circuitous way to Coffeyville where the company has a main line down to the gulf. When this north and south line is luilt, not only will the Missouri Pa cific have practically a new line through a prosperous and fertile coun try from which it can draw all kinds of traffic but it will also save more than a hundred mile haul on its pres ent traffic to the jrulf. As the road now runs the outlet from the traffic secured at Omaha and over the Central Branch and other branches runs into Kansas City via Atchison. It is proposed that the north and south line, and its route has been surveyed already, will run from Omaha along "the present line to Falls City, Neb. From Falls City a new line will be built, about thirty-five miles long, to Goff in Nemaha county. From Goff there is al ready a branch which runs down through Holton and on into Kansas City via Leavenworth. This line will be left at Birmingham, Jackson county, and a new piece of road will be built directly south to Topeka. From Topeka the present line to Fort Scott will lie used as far as Waverly in Coffey coun ty. Another new piece of road will fc. built directly south from Waverly to TeRoy and Moody where connection will be made with a present line that runs directly south to Coffeyville. WUh the work of constructing the new pieces of railroad necessary Tor this line Is going on the company pro poses to practically rebuild the ex isting lines which will be a part of the route and fix them up in the best possible shape for the heavy traffic they will have to bear.

XEARLY THE COLDEST DAY. TIio Mercury Drops to Sixteen Degrees This Morning. The weather today is much colder than it has been for several weeks. The minimum this morning was 15 degrees which lacks one degree of being the coldest of the season. In the northern edge of the United States there is a uniform temperature of 28 degrees be low the zero mark. For this evening and tomorrow the weather will be a good deal colder, al though there will be no storm.as there is in some localities. Tomorrow morning the mercury will drop to ten degrees above and it is pretty certain to be the coldest morning yet. The wind today is blowing at the rate of 12 miles an hour from the north. The following are the temperatures for today: 7 o'clock IS 1 11 o'clock 20 8 o'clock 16 12 o'clock 22 9 o'clock 17 1 o'clock 25 10 o'clock 18 2 o'clock 23 RIGIIARDVACATES Archbishop of Paris Leaves the Episcopal Palace. Yonng Men Draw Ills Carriage Through the Streets. Pari?. Dec. 17. Cardinal Richard, archbishop of. Paris today voluntarily vacated the episcopal palace and tem porarily accepted tha hospitality cf Deny Cochin, the conservative deputy at the latter's residence in the rue De Babylon The departure of the prim ate was the occasion for an imposing manifestation on the part of the ma jority of the bishops and priests or Paris, many members of the nobility and about 4,000 men, women and chil dren. The gathering completely block ed the street in front of the episcopal palace and those present sang the Credo and other Canticles as the car dinal was assisted into his carriage by the coadjutor archbishop, Monsignor Amiette, and his two vicars general. The crowd knelt and chanted as the cardinal seated himself in the vehicle. The venerable prelate, who was much affected, then arose and blessed the multitude. A number of young Catho lics thereupon approached the car riage, detached the horses and with difficulty dragged it through the dense masses of people lining the streets. On all sides were heard cries of "long live Pius X" and "long live the cardinal.' About three-quarters of an hour wan consumed In pulling the carriage from the palace to the residence of M. Cochin, a distance of about one mile. Detachments of mounted Republican guards preceded and followed the pro cession in order to prevent any pos sible disorder, but there was not the slightest attempt on the part of the crowds to make any counter manifes tations. named by Natural Gas. Kansas City, Kan., Dec. 17. Hans Johnson, 626 Reynolds avenue, was burned about the face and hands by an explosion of natural gas in his home Saturday afternoon. He went into a small room and struck a match to light a gas jet which was not provided with a burner. The match went out and when Johnson struck another match enough gas had escaped to cause an explosion. Johnson's hair, mustache and beard were burned. Sunday Snow at Galena. Galena, Kan., Dec. 17.

Anti-Catholic Party in Rome .Numbering Thousands Celebrate Downfall of Church in France. the THREATEN V A T I C A N. Palace of the Pope Is Sur rounded by Troops. Government Troops Are Forced to Charge the Mob. Rome, Dec. 17. The extreme parties strongly protest against the repression of yesterday's popular demonstration here in sympathy with France and are organizing new manifestations. The leaders urge their adherents in the meanwhile to leave their cards at the French embassy where they are piling up by the thousands. Rome, Dec. 17. Thousands of demon strators friendly to France and of anti vatican tendencies gathered last night in the piazza adjoining the Farnese pal ace, the seat of the French embassy, in an endeavor to express their pleasure at France's action toward the church. The whole garrison of Rome was em ployed to face the demonstrants and pro tect the Vatican, which is surrounded by cavalry, and the bridges leading to the apostolic palace are barred by troops. All thu streets leading to the palace Farnese are protected by soldiers with fixed bayonets. Tli j demonstrators, led by a dozen rad ical socialists and republican members of the chamber of deputies, including Prince Borghese, after vainly attempt ing to break the cordon, provided them selves with candles and formed into a mock procession, intoning the "Mis erere" as an indication of the death of clericalism, amidst cries of "Long live Fiance," "Dong live Clemenceau" and "Down with the Vatican." Deputies Costa and De Felice tried to harangue the people, but the police in terfered. The demonstration occurred near the - lonument to Giordano Bruno the monk philosopher, who was buried alive, a victim of religious intolerance. Deputy Costa finally made himself heard. He said: "Before this monument to Bruno, of free thought, let us send our applause to France tor this great people contin uing the traditional obstinate struggle against the moth eaten clericalism." Fresh attempts were then made to beat oack the cordon and the cavalry charged the demonstrators, a few of whom were slightly injured and several arrested. Amid roars and shouts and the stngtng of the Marseillaise, the fer ment continued until late In the even ing. A commission of the demonstrators was received by M. Barrere, the French ambassador, who expressed his appre ciation for the sympathy of the Roman people. The government endeavored by all means to prevent the demonstration. The stand that the government is tak ing is that although Italy is friendly to France she does not wish to take sides in the dispute, especially when her re lations with the church are better now than they have since 1870. Spain Will Keep Out. Rome, Dec. 17. The Spanish govern ment has notified the Vatican that it objects to taking charge at present of the archives of the papel nunciature at Paris owing to the rupture of di plomatic relations between France and the Vatican. Spain certainly would have accepted the task If requested by the Vatican to do so when the papal nuncio at Paris. Monsignor Loenzeh was recalled, as France then could not have made any objection. But after the Will Pe Extended to Connect Topeka. i : I explosion of Monsignor Montagnlnl,. the secretary of the nunciature, and the search of the archives, such a step as taking charge of the papal interests In France might be regarded as hostile to the French government, . It is stated in this connection that the Vatican authorities made a mistake in not ap plying immediately after the search of the archives to Count Tornielli, the Italian ambassador at Paris, not as the ambassador of Italy, but as dean of the diplomatic corps, whose duty it is to protect the privileges of the corps. IN THEITaLDWcLL case State Will Attempt to Offset Strong Point ot .Defendant. Salina, Kan., Dec. 17. It is evident from testimony introduced so far in the trial of Susan Caldwell for the murder of her husband, that the state will at tempt to prove that the crime was com mitted some tltna before Mrs. Caldwell says her husband was killed. The only statement Mrs. Caldwell has ever given concerning the murder was that she was sleeping by her husband's side at the time and that she did not awake when the blows were struck which end ed Caldwell's life, but that she was aroused from her sleep by the stroke of the clock at midnight. The state has contended in the for mer trials that no fewer than six blows were struck upon Caldwell's head and that they were struck from the side of the bed where Mrs. Caldwell says she was sleeping, and with such force that blood was spattered over the entire room and even in great blotches on the ceiling. The assertion is made that It would have been an utter impossibility for the wife to have slept during that time even if there were no further evi dence to show that she was not lying in the bed as she states. In the examination of Albert Ridge way, a hired man on the Caldwell farm at the time of the murder, the state laid the foundation for showing that Caldwell must have been killed before midnight. Ridgeway was sleep ng in a room on the second floor of the Caldwell home and was awakened by Mrs. Caldwell saying, "Albert, Al bert, get up and come down stairs -Mr. Caldwell is gasping and struggling for breath." Ridgeway says he hurriedly dressed and went down the stairs and, taking a light from the sitting room where Mrs. Caldwell was seated, he went into the bedroom and found Caldwell already dead. The blood had ceased to flow from his wounds when Ridge way reached the bedside. The last declaration startled Mrs. Caldwell's attorneys and they immediately at tacked Ridgeway's testimony, but did not succeed in shaking it materially. Ridgeway said that Mrs. Caldwell did not go into the room with him,, but that she remained aloof from the bed side, although she; says that she did not know her husband was dead until Ridgeway told her.. This was a strong point against Mrs. ' Caldwell. Another sensational feature of the trial Saturday was the testimony of Harry Caldwell, the young man who has been his mother's constant sup port during all the trials. Harry was placed on the iafd and asked If he did not accompany his mother to the office of the couiH.j attorney to seek lfigal redress because of . his. father's treatment of 'Mrs. CaldwelL He ad mitted that they were at the county attorney's office and that they went there to make complaint. They de sired to have Caldwell placed undr bond to keep the peace and prevent his separating Harry and his mother by driving Harry from home. 

TURKEYSVVERETOOHIGII Inmates of State Charitable Institu tions will Eat Chicken Christmas. Wards of Kansas, the inmates of the nine state insritutions, are going to have a (rood Christmas dinner this year. The state board of control has completed arrangements for the extra Items which will appear on the bill of fare at each institution. It was first believed '.hat turkeys could be pur chased for all, but when the bids for these birds were asked for from the butchers, it was found that the prices were rrohibltivo and so it was de cided to substitute chickens. The chickens will be roasted with oyster dressing. The inmates at each hospital or in stitution will have, in addition to usual vegetables and fixings, chicken, mince pies, cranberry sauce, apples, oranges, candy, peanuts, olives, cabbage and nuts. Practically the same bill will be provided at each institution, with a few added dainiies for sick inmates. The toy and present list for the In mates of institutions has not been made up as yet. Each inmate will re ceive a present of some kind from the state. In the children's homes and the boys' and girls' industrial schools there will be a world of toys. That there will be plenty to eat for all at the Christmas feast is evidenced at a glance at the provisions which will be purchased for the state hos pital for the insane at Topeka. These include 1,500 pounds of chicken; 500 cabbages: 325 pounds of mincemeat; 0V3 barrels of cranberries; 5 barrels of apples: 9 boxes of oranges; 450 pounds of candy; 200 pounds of peanuts; one gallon of olives; 10 pounds of assorted nuts and cans of oysters. A propor tionate amount of each of these things will be r-urchased for each of the in stitutions.

Metcalf Is Transferred to the Head of the Navy. BONAPAItTE MOVES UP, He Succeeds Moody as Attorney General of U. S. Best of Feeling Is Manifested on AH Sides. Washington, Dec. 17. Oscar S. Straus of New York, today was induct ed into the office of secretary of the department of commerce and labor la pursuance of the rearrangement of the cabinet recently made by President Roosevelt. The ceremony incident to the retire ment of Secretary Metcalf, who has been at the head of the department since July 1, 1905, and the Induction into office of Secretary Straus took place shortly after 9 o'clock this morn ing in the secretary's offices at the de partment. The oath of office was ad ministered to Mr. Straus by Frank H. Lamed, chief clerk of the bureau of Immigration. Secretary MetcalT, in relinquishing the duties of the office, formally ex pressed to those about him his great personal regret at the severance of relations which always had been so pleasant. He assured them, however, that Mr. Straus would maintain similar cordial relations with the people of the department. Secretary Straus in a brief address expressed the desire to continue the pleasant relations between Secretary Metcalf and the officials of the depart ment and said that it would be his purpose so far as might be possible to continue the policies of his predecessor. He said he would take his cue from the president, one feature of whose great strength lies In the fact that he could depend upon and enlist the hearty co operation of those about him. At the conclusion of the address Secretary Straus and Secretary Metcalf held an informal reception of the bu reau heads. Theodore Derlwed. one of the clerks of the .department, has been selected by Secretary Straus to be his private secretary. Leon A. Clark, who has been private secretary to Secretary Metcalf, will continue with Mr. Met calf in a like character in the navy department. Secretary Metcalf arrived at the navy department with Secretary Bona parte at 10:15 ..The oaths of office were administered by Solicitor Hannah of the navy department in the pres ence of Assistant Secretary Newberry,' Rear Admiral Rixey. surgeon general of the navy; Assistant Secretary Mur ray of the department of commerce and labor, and the bureau chiefs of that department, who went to the navy de partment in a body after Mr. Straus had been inducted into office. Secretary Bonaparte in a brief ad dress congratulated the new secretary upon the compliment implied upon his character by his appointment to the office of secretary of the navy. No office', he said, exists of greater mo ment to the honor, the vital interest and even the natural life of our com mon country. Secretary Metcalf briefly responded, declaring that he always had taken an interest in the American navy. His first assignment as a member of the house of representatives, he said, was to the naval committee, and that in terest became intensified. The secre tary then received the officers and em ployes of the navy department. At 11 o'clock Charles J. Bonaparte, the retiring secretary of the navy, took the prescribed oath as attorney general and entered upon his new duties. The obligation was administered by Mr. Sornberg, the appointment clerk in the department of Justice, in the presence of Mr. Bonaparte's predecessor, Wil liam H. Moody, he assistant attorneys general, the solicitor general and the other principal officers of the depart ment of justice. Mr. Moody was the first to offer congratulations. Mr. Bonaparte declared he would be guided in the performance of his duties by the example and counsel of his predeces sor. 

MOODY OX THE BENCH. Former Attorney General Becomes an Associate Justice. Washington, Dec. 17. William H. Moodv. formerly attorney general, to day er.tered upon his duties as an as sociate justice of the supreme court of the United States, thus bringing the court up to Its full membership. He was inducted into office at the begin ning of today's sitting of the court. Having, as is customary in such cases, taken the regular oath of office in the robing room before entering the court chamber, he was preceded into the larger apartment by all the other members of the tribunal. When he reached the desk of the clerk of the court he stopped, while the other members continued to their seats.

Justice Brewer Pays Tribute to State ot His Adoption. New York, Dec. 17. "I know of no better illustration of the phenomenal growth that everywhere characterizes the history of our national life than that afforded by Kansas," said Justice Brewer of the supreme court today. The Justice spoke at the session of the People's Forum in New Rochelle, upon "The Larger and Higher Life of the Nation." "When I studied geography," said the Justice, "there was no such name on the maps of our country. When I first went to the territory there was not a line of railroad in it and the people used to gather to see the ponv express dash by with its packet of mall for the people farther west. Today there are IV2 million people in the borders of that state and its grain crop last year wa3 large enough to supply twenty bushels to every family in the United States. "That is an example of our bigness in this land of ours. Do I err when I say that pride in the bigness of things is one of the chief American charac teristics? Pride in the bigness and the fullness of plenty? Do we not point out the longest ear of corn, the tallest building? Do we hot hail the mother of triplets?" Declaring that the most significant and impressive fact about America is its size, he sent out a warning against an increasing tendency to make size and bigness and power the main Issue. Particularly was he worried about the ever increasing tendency to public in debtedness or "mortgages on the earn ings of the future." "America stands out like Hercules of mythology," he said. "It is the giant of nations. But size is not the only thing to be looked for in a nation. It seems to me that in more ways than one we are unwisely discounting the future. Since the Spanish-American war debt paying has been forgotten and we now owe as much as we did ten years ago. "Many of these expenditures are fully justified, but there runs through much of it a strain of speculation, an unjust casting of burdens on those who are to come after. Unlike-private in debtedness, public indebtedness does not wipe out property now existing, but is a debt which those who come after must pay. Public indebtedness mortgages future development. I. for one, can not rejoice to see this country covered with municipal bonds. "We hear much about the trusts. The most dangerous trust of them all is our trust in the future to pay our debts." Decrying the war spirt which de mands the constant enlargement of the army and navy. Justice Brewer paid this tribue to the late John Hay: "He did more to make this a world power than all the battleships we have built or will build." SENT 2,500 LETTERS. Secretary Heath Preparing for Big Meetlne of Stock Breeders. Secretary H. A.

BURNED IN A BARREL. Charred Remains or a Young Woman Found on a Mountain. Hazelton, Pa., Dee. 17. The charred remains of a young woman were found today on the mountain between here and Ebervale. A slipper, combs and the frame of a woman's hat were ipek ed up nearby. Under the body were three wire hoops such as are used on barrels. It is the belief of the police that the woman was murdered and then placed in the barrel and burned. This theory is strengthened by the odor of kerosene near the place. The iden tity of the woman has not been estab lished. SENATE AGREES TO IT. The International Harvester Company Slated for Investigation. Washington, Dec. 17.

ONLY ONE MOSQUITO Yi&s Found and That 'ot of the Bad Kind. Found Work Progressing in Host Satisfactory Manner. Washington, Dec. 17 President Roose velt today transmitted to congress his promised message on the isthmian ca nal. It follows: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: In the month of November I visited the Isthmus of Panama, going over tha canal zone with considerable care; ami also visited the cities of Panama ami Colon, which are not in the zone or un der the United States flag, but as to which the United States government, through Its agents, exercises control for certain sanitary purposes. The U. S. S. Louisiana, on which I was, anchored off Colon about half past 2 on Wednesday afternoon, No vember 14. I came aboard her, after my stay on shore, at about half past 9 on Saturday evening. November 17. On Wednesday afternoon and evening I received the president of Panama and his suite, and saw members of the canal commission, and various other gentle men, perfecting the arrangement for my visit, so that every hour that I was ashore could be employed to advant age. I was three days ashore not a. sufficient length of time to allow of an exhaustive investigation of the minutiae of the work of any single de partment, still less to pass Judgment on the engineering problems. but enough to enable me to get a clear idea of the salient features of the great work and of the progess that has been made as regards the sanitation of tha zone. Colon, and Panama, the carina for and housing of the employes, and the actual digging of the canal. The zone Is a narrow strip of land, and it can be inspected much as one can inspect 50 or 60 miles of a great rail road, at the point where it run.-, through mountains or overcomes other natural obstacles. I chose the month of November for my visit partly because it is the rain iest month of the year, the month In which the work goes forward at the greatest disadvantage, and one of the two months which the medical depart ment of the French Canal company found most unhealthy. Immediately after anchoring on the afternoon, of Wednesday there wn a violent storm of wind and rain. From that time we did not again see the sun. "until Saturday morning, the fain con tinuing almost steadily, but varying from a fine drizzle to torrential down pour. During that time in fifteen min utes at Cristobal 1.05 Inches of rain fell; from 1 to 3 a. m., November 16. 3.2 inches fell; for the twenty-four hours ending noon, November 16, 4. 68 inches fell, and for the six days ending; noon, November 16, 10.24 Inches fell. The Chagres rose in flood to a greater height than It had attained during the last fifteen years, tearing out the track in one place. It would have been im possible to see the work going on un der more unfavorable weather condi tions. On Saturday. November 17, the sun shone now and then for a few minutes, although the day was gen erally overcast and there were heavy showers at intervals. First Day Ashore. On Thursday morning we landed at about half pas; seven and went slowly over the line of the Panama railway, ending with an expedition In a tus at the Pacific entrance of the canal out to the islands where the dredging for the canal will cease. We took our dinner at one of the eating houses furnished by the commission for the use of the government employes no warning of our coming being given. I inspected the Ancon hospital, going through the various wards both for white patients and for colored pa tients. I inspected portions of the constabulary (Zone police), examining the men individually. I also examined certain of the schools and saw the school children, both white and col ored, speaking with certain of the teachers. In the afternoon of this day I was formally received In Panama by President Amador, who, together with the government and all the people of Panama, treated me with the most considerate courtesy, for which I hereby extend my most earnest thanks. I was driven through Pan ama and in a public square was form ally received and welcomed by the president and other members of the government; and in the evening I at tended a dinner given by the presi dent, and a reception which was also a government function. I also drove through the streets of Panama for tht purpose of observing what had been done. We slept at the Hotel Tivoli, at Ancon, which is on a hill directly out side the city of Panama, but in th Zone. Second Day. On Friday morning we left the ho tel at 7 o'clock and spent the entire day going through the Culebra cut the spot in which most work will have to be done in any event. We watched the different steam shovels working; we saw the drilling and blasting; we saw many of the dirt trains (of the different types used.) both carrying the earth away from the steam shov els and depositing it on the dumps -some of the dumps being run out in the Jungle merely to get rid of tha earth, while in other cases they are being used for double tracking tha railway, and in preparing to build the great dams. I visited many of the dif ferent villages, inspecting thoroughly many different buildings the local re ceiving hospitals, the houses in which the unmarried white workmen live, those in which the unmarried colored workmen live; also the quarters of the white married employes and of the married colored employes; as well as the commissary stores, the bath houses, the water-closets, the cook sheds for the colored laborers, and the government canteens, or hotels, at which most of the white employes take their meals. I went through tha 1 (Continued on Next Page.
