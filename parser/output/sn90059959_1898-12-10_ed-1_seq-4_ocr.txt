The l^eech Lake Indians of Minnesota do not like to be prevented from killing deer out of season. Unless they are handled judiciously by the game officials they may imitate the Pillagers and go on the warpath. and that a Scotchman named MacDou gall, who closely resembles him, posed as the French officer. The story lacks confirmation, and is quite Improbable. A report has reached Washington to the effect that Agulnaldo, leader of the insurgents in the Philippines, has re nounced Catholicity and become an Episcopalian. He was merely a nomi nal Catholic, who disregarded the pre cepts and practices of the church. From all accounts the Catholic church has rea son to rejoice fgr getting rid of the fol low so easily. The Catholic churches of Cincinnati have been forbidden to allow the singing of certain masses because they too closely resemble operatic music, or, to use the words of one of the leading j- priests of the city, are "too stagey." Hereafter, the committee on church mu sic of the diocese will pass upon each piece before it is allowed to be sung. .The Gridiron club, of Washington. D. C., gave a military dinner last Satur day, and waved the American and Brit ish colors as a prelude to an address by Sir Julian Pauncefotr the English am bassador. President McKlniey honored the occasion with his presence, and Clapped his Anglomaniac hands at the Bight of the Anglo-S ixon flags. A London paper says that Maj. Mar chand, of Fashoda fame.

PRESIDENT M'KINLEY'S MESSAGE. The message of President-McKinley at the opening of congress last Monday is bo lengthy that we have not had time to read it from beginning to end. He com mences the document by commenting on the war with Spain and its consequences, and concludes by recommending the alien labor law problem to the consider ation of the national legislators. Touching the new possessions result ing from the war with Spain he says a discussion of their government will be appropriate after the Paris treaty of peace has been ratified. Not a syllable does he utter regarding the disposition or government of the Philippine islands, but he says as soon as Cuba passes into our possession and the island is pacified "it will be necessary to give aid and di rection to its people to form a govern ment for themselves." He-asserts that "this should be undertaken at the earliest moment consistent with safety and as sured success." We are glad to have him speak thus, though the period at which Cuba may be handed over to Its own people for self-government may be far distant, if American carpet-baggers once get a firm footing on Cuban soil. Until this government considers the cap tured islands lit for self-government the president announces It as lii.s duty to continue the military governments which have existed since our occupation of thc-m. Whether the Insurgents who had fought Spain so long will be satisfied or not with this arrangement does not seem to bother his excellency a particle. He refers to the Nicaraguan canal in a round-about way and declares that "its construction is now more than ever in dispensable to that intimate and ready water communication between our east ern and western seaboards." It is to be desired that this country shall have exclusive control of the canal and ignore I the pretensions of Great Britain in the Clayton-Uulwer treaty, under the terms of which the American government would be prevented from exercising any control over the waterway and debarred from fortifying the entrances to the ca nal without the consent of England. The London Times, in referring to British rights in the canal, says that if the free dom of it is secured to ships of all na tions, as in the Suez canal, "wo shall not need to stand strictly upon claims which originated when the circum stances were altogether different." The fact is that England sees the fu tility of claiming any rights in the canal which would lie recognized for a moment by congress, and during this time ef Anglo-Saxon love-feasting she deems it better to forego the alleged claim and keep on the right, side of Uncle Sam. If there is no "open door" in the I'hilip pines for the benefit of British trade we may be sure of hearing a tierce roar from the "lion that walks like a man." llut the secretary of state is too English to cause the lion to roar. The president, of course, refers with England." He does not say, however, that the United States is under any ob ligation to England for preventing other European powers from meddling In the late unpleasantness. Were there any foundation for that friendliness of Eng land, of which the newspapers so fre quently prate, President McKinley would lie happy to mention it in his message when speaking of our friendly relations with his "mother country," of which he is so fond. But he could not, in the face of the foreign ministers at Washington, who would promptly contradict him, say that this country is indebted one iota to England except for soft sayings that signify nothing In diplomacy. The message has elicited different opinions as to its merits. The Repub lican papers think It an admirable doc ument and so do I lie Republican politi cians of the McKinley stripe. The Dem ocrats, on the other hand, fail to see anything In It to extol. In our opinion It. lacks the candor and straight forward ness that, should characterize a message at this critical period of tile country's history. We hope that congress will deal with it as it deserves. 

WHAT CANADIANS THINK OF IT The thirst for empire and conqucst by the United States, or rather by the im perialist party in the Republic, says the Canadian Freeman, bodes evil for the aUtj of Is simply to be given "out of pure gen- foreign complications the men at the erosity as compensation for the im- admiration of the world. Forgetful ot th(! lessons of the early t£Uhers Qf Ule natlon and 1( n01.lng lhc admonitlolls Washington and Jefferson to avoid heh„ ot stllte seem to be Uod provements made by Spain in the arclii- either the force of jingoism or spccula pelago. It is hard for plain, honest people to understand the "humanity" tors, to spread tlioir territorial posses sions where sooner or later foreign com plications must result. Setting aside the fact that the United States in her exact ions ou Spain has adopted the old robber policy on which has been founded the empire of Britain and Russia, and that her excuse for duty, etc., is about as transparent a plea as ever a robbing na tion presented to the world by way of apology for wrong-doing, no true friend of the republic can view her new de parture from tho safe policy of conlinen talism other than with regret. Can the addition of a horde of Malays or mil lions of mongrel Carrilis to he popu lation add one lota to her strength, or can the creation of new race troubles add to her internal progress or domestic happiness? To guard In time of war her distant possessions must demand tho creation and maintenance of heavy ad ditions to her army and an enormous in crease of her navy, with all the attend ant evils which a national craze for glory rpKK-'^^t*n\^^.7.vT*wTf'^T 7^^'3^-^-*?s^/.^^Tnrp^---.'.-':'r-.-^- ever begets. Surely the continent of North America, with Its vast potentiali ties, was field enough for centuries of na tional enterprise, and the negro question surely presented enough of a race prob lem for the prudence of her people with out adding to It by bringing into the commonwealth other races equally as distinct from Caucasian, without know ing the English language or knowing aught of American customs. The Irish nation has unstintingly gloried in the progress and well-doing of the great republic, and we, as of the race, have shared in the gratitude that all oppressed people have constantly shown the United States, but this does not deter us from pointing out the dan gers to the republic that must be the out come of a policy of war and conquest. No nation or empire ever possessed so great or so compact a heritage as the United States. It was founded by men who loved freedom and peace. They left be hind them warnings to those who should come after to avoid the very evils which the national guides are embracing today. Just as true today as when the words were written is it that "They who sow the wind will reap the whirlwind," and though this generation of Americans will not fully realize the evils of foreign con quest and foreign dominion, it cannot be eliminated from the minds of those who love the republic as the home of the op pressed of every race and clime, that the hour has come when on her national temple should be engraved the words: "The Glory of our House has departed." THEY ARE NOT PARALLEL CASES. The promoters of extension of terri tory to the uttermost bounds of the earth in view of imperial sway and "our mani fest destiny," are wont to assert that there is nothing new about the policy ot acquiring the far-away Philippines, and thnt it is in accord with the policies pur sued by previous administrations. They cite the" purchase of Louisiana and of Alaska as notable instances to show there is no deviation from established precedent in the new departure. An article in the St. Paul Globe will con vince any one but an Inveterate expan sionist that the cases are far from being analogous. The territories acquired by purchase from France and Russia are on the American continent, while that from Spain is located thousands of miles be yond our borders. The Globe shows quite clearly that there is no similarity in other respects between the purchase from Spain by compulsion and the two purchases referred to by the advocates of expansion. We extract the following from our St. Paul contemporary and di direct the attention of our readers to it: "The constitution gave Jefferson no express power to purchase Louisiana," says John Fisks, the historian, "but this purchase was so clearly for the good of the nation that people generally ap plauded it." Jefferson overdrew bis vis ible deposit of power, but that he did not overdraw his credit was proved by his re-election. It will lie noticed that Mr. Fiske says "approved by the people," not by the party. When the president draws upon his credit his action must bo so free from class interest, so free from parti san motives and so obviously for the good of the country, that party utter ances blend into the nation's approval. When Jefferson bought Louisiana the government was but learning to vallc the groat territory was in the hands of the French, held by Napoleon as a r.ew foothold for his empire. But he could not keep it because England was prepar ing to fight him. Jefferson's purchase was in action what the Monroe doctrine was in words. "These United States will like the European powers better if tlioy keep their distance," was the import of the Monroe doctrine—a creed to which all citizens of the United States have subscribed. Therefore any additions of continental territory made during the various administrations have been but varied expressions of the Monroe doc trine, and in such actions the presidents have not overdrawn their credit. Is the policy of McKinley, as ex pressed in the peace treaty whose terms he has dictated, a carrying out or a reversal of the spirit of the Monroe doc trine? Is he using this constitutional "credit" upon which Jefferson, Jackson, and Lincoln drew for tho interests of his party or the interests of the people? Jef ferson and Monroe annexed continental territories to get rid, as far as possible, of monarchical neighbors. McKinley de mands Poito Rico, Guam, one of tile Car olines, and all of the Philippines, and makes us next door governmental neigh bors to European and Asiatic nations. Like Jefferson and Jackson he had credit, but whether ho has ruined it in class interest a people, not a party, will tell him in 1900. 

STILL TALKING OF AN ALLIANCE. According to the London correspond ent of the New York Journal a British personage of exalted rank, whose uttor I ance is considered very significant, ap peared at the ban-iiul of the American society in London on Thanksgiving day and made a speech which delighted the I hearts of all tho Anglo-maniacs present. The British oflicial in question waa no I other than l^ord Ilalsbury, a member of the Conservative ministry, and the pres cnt lord high chancellor of England, The correspondent declares that a p'lbiic utterance by such a man is virtually an utterance by the house of lord-:, that ho seldom speaks in public, and when lie docs he speaks deliberately and with authority, his voice being the voico of aristocratic England. Tho correspond ent says that as this high functionary stood at the banquet table among the flowers, with the British and American flags draped on the wall behind him, his cheeks flushed and his eyes flashing and his clinched list swung upward, the vast audience half rose from the tables as he said: "I think I may say, without fear of boasting that, once united, we may defy the world in arms." To impress upon American *$P$*?nz THE IRISH STANDARD, SATURDAY. DECEMBER 10, 1898 readers the significance of this utter ance, the correspondent avers that had the queen herself said it the thing could not have come from a more responsible source, which is really a fact. We have always maintained that by hook or by crook England is determined to form an alliance with the United States, not to preserve peace among the nations, as alleged by the Anglomaniacs who are working up the scheme in this country, but solely to browbeat aud In timidate the commercial i»wers of Eu rope by the formidable armed forces of both English speaking countries, "Once united," says the lord chancellor, "we may defy the world in arms." Since the present American adminis tration has entered on an expansion career in the east, every effort In season and out of season is being made by Brit ishers both in this country and England to bring about an era of good feeling be tween Uncle Sam and John Bull which may ultimately result in a coalition of the two "Anglo-Saxon" nations against the entire world. That would be a splendid outcome of all the gush of the Britishers on both sides of the Atlantic —for mother England. But what bene fit would such an alliance be to this country if It does not provoke quarrels with the continental powers of Europe in its new policy of expansion on the other side of the earth? If the United States makes the mistake of governing the Philippine islands in Imitation of England's government of India and goes around the globe with a chip on its shoulders and appears eager for a tight with nations that speak other languages than English, then it may become neces sary to have England for an ally, but not till then. If the United States refuses to grant an "open door" in the Philippines and does not support England in demanding the same thing in Chinese ports, this talk of kinship and friendship on the part of the English aristocracy may suddenly cease and the Yankees may be abused and caricatured in British periodicals as in former times. Selfishness is at the bottom of English professions of friend ship for this country, and the American who doubts it has studied British di plomacy in vain. We earnestly hope that the McKinley cabinet, pro-British as it is, will go slowly and cautiously in entering into any compact or under standing with England. The first shot fired by England ^.nd!" America in con cert against any European or Asiatic na tion will be the dentil knell of the Re publican party and the name of McKin ley will be a by-word |or ages to come. 

CANNOT BE HELD AS COLONIES. The other day Senator Vest, of Mis souri, sounded the first note of the anti expansionists by introducing the follow ing joint resolution in the United States senate: "That under the. .constitution of the United States no power is given to the federal government! to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as colonies. "The colonial systemi of European na tions cannot be established under our present constitution, but all territory ac quired by tho government, except such small amount as may be necessary for coaling stations, creation of boundaries, and similar governmental purposes, must be acquired and governed with the pur pose of ultimately organizing such terri tory into states suitable for admission into the union." Some Americans thoughtlessly recom mend that the recently, acquired posses sions from Spain be governed on the English plan—that the Philippines be governed by the United States as India is governed by England. Andrew Carne gie tells in a letter to a New York paper, which Is reproduced in this issue of The Irish Standard, how India has been gov erned, or, properly speaking, misgovern ed, by Anglo-Saxon England. Any American who has read of Hastings and Cllve in India would not like an Ameri can governor to copy their barbarity in tho Philippines, or anywhere else. If Americans model their colonial govern ment, if they are to have any, upon that of England in the East In dies. some future poet may say of this republic what Montgom ery said of England, that it has "won an empire, but lost its name." The fol lowing from the Sacramento Bee, in re ply to Bishop Hurst, of the M. E. Church, who extolled England for her Justice and education in India, will give an idea cf the humanity of British rule in that col ony and elsewhere: "Justice and education, forsooth! What justice has she ever represented save that bastard type which found its highest Illustration in blowing robbed and defrauded Sepoys from the cannon's mouth? What education among oppress ed peoples has she stood sponsor for but that form of educa^on {exemplified In fastening an opium vice on the Chinese people, against the j^rot^gt of the Chi nese government, because it represented millions upon million? of) profit to pirat ical British tradesmen? What civiliza tion has gone hand ii^hand with her con quests save that civilization which taught her to massacre 3/),000 Dervishes in the Soudan after she had won her 'God-given victory' there?" What justice did she grant to the men ot Ireland? The ju'stice' of the prison and the gibbet for faring to demand their rights and proving faithful to their religion? Did she not hunt them into jails and on to the gallows, or over the seas because they wished to be educated in their own faith Did she not deny them all the privileges of education un less they consented to be educated as traitors to the creed in which their mothers had been born? And the justice and education which England granted to India? Have not all her acts to the people of India been those of a pirate and a freebooter since the day the East India Company first treacherously gained a foothold there? And what education has she ever blessed the masses of India with unless it be education to endeavor to teach people how to live without food when granaries are overflowing and a famine fund amounting to over 1100,000,000 has been stolen? What justice and education did Eng land grant to the Abyssinians, to the Zulus, to the Egyptians, to any people with whom she has come in contact? And yet a minister of the Gospel who should be preaching the doctrine that Christ taught on the Mount, is pleading with the United States to emulate Eng land's "three glowing centuries of justice and education." The total number of votes cast for gov ernor in Minnesota last month is 251,268. Gov. Llnd's plurality, according to the official count, is 20,189. A Michigan she-lawyer was nominated as a joke for prosecuting attorney, and elected. The opposing candidate says there was fraud in the count, and her election may be contested. At a recent indignation meeting of colored citizens in Cleveland, O., the home of Mark Hanna, President McKin ley and the governor of the Buckeye state were roundly denounced. President McKinley's message occupies fifteen columns of the Minneapolis Trib une In minion type. We understand that the editor of our esteemed contemporary has not had time to wade through it yet. The Nation, of San Francisco, an nounces the arrival of Rev. Fr. Sheehy, the Irish Nationalist, in that city, on a lecture tour for the benefit of his new parish church in Bruree, county of Lim erick. The new palatial residence of Andrew Carnegie on Fifth avenue. New York City, will cost 11,000,000. The building will Include library and conservatories, an art gallery, a music room and a ball room. The deed to the property has been drawn in the name of his wife. The London papers seem to be pretty well pleased with the president's mes sage. The "Thunderbolt" says that since England recognized the sovereignty of the United States no president has re ferred to "the mother country" in lan guage so cordial and friendly as Mr. Mc Kinley. Robert Buchanan dedicates his new novel, "Father Anthony," a romance of life in Connaught, to an Irish priest, and says: "In Father Anthony himself you will recognize a dim likeness to one whom we both knew and loved. For his sake and also for yours I shall always feel strong affection toward the Irish mother church." Says Father Cronin, in the Buffalo Un ion and Times: "Neither Kerry in par ticular nor Ireland in general takes much pride in Gen. Kitchener's pronouncement that he was born in the historic county of mountain and heather. Some of the most ruthless oppressors that Ireland has known were born and reared In that sea encircled land. "Spanish mackerel" disappeared from the menus in many of the New York ho tels and retaurants after the beginning of the war with Spain. Their place is now taken by Irish mackerel. The de mand for the Irish variety is now very great, and transatlantic liners bring as regular cargo many barrels of Bait mack erel shipped from Kinsale and Skib bereen, Ireland. Pat O'Neill, a farmer of County Kerry, Ireland, accompanied by his wife and 10 children, landed in New York last week from the steamship Lucania. The eldest child is 12 years old. and the youngest 2. There are two sets of twins, one set of triplets and three sin gles. Mrs. O'Neill is still a young woman, ^he and her husband are going to hell populate the rural parts of Michigan. Look out for a rise in the pries of flour. A special to the St. Paul Pioneer Press from New York says that a flour trust has been formed in that city to control nearly all of tho product in this country and also tli2 supply of thtee- fourths of the world. I* is said that the Pillsbury-Wasliburn Milling company, of Minneapolis, has joined the trust, but C. A. Pillsbury does not place any credence In the report. Admiral Sampson took a prominent part in the late war for humanity, in bombarding the Cuban coast with shot and shell, without inflicting much dam age on the Spanish enemy. In his re port of the Santiago operations he shows that he was not at all actuated by hu mane motives, for he bluntly remarks that he could afford to risk and lose his men, but he couid not afford to risk and lose his ships. A man of his disposition is not fitted for the rank he occupies in the American navy. Howard W. Bray, an Englishman, who lived for 15 years in the Philippine islands, has contributed an article to the "Independent," in which he says that 83 per cent of the Filipinos can read and write. If that be true, they are better educated than the people who ruled them, and the Catholic church has not been idle in the work of civilization. According to the writer Manila is the most cultured city in the Orient, and its people are quite as civilized as those of any similar city in the world. The following from the Boston Pilot may be of interest to Western Anglo maniacs: "As a matter ot historical fact, which nobedy will deny, there has not been a Saxon monarch on the throne of England since Harold. The Planta genets were Normans, who despised the Saxon "churls the Tudors were Welsh, the Stuarts were Scotch, and the Hano­ verians and Guelphs were and are Ger man. The only Anglo-Saxons existing are to be found in America, where they are of every race, color and previous con dition of servitude. They are as mythi cal as the "Scotch-Irish," whose origi nal habitat was Noman's Land. The St. Paul Pioneer Press, which is edited by a gray-headed Nova Scotian named Wheelock, thinks that Cushman K. Davis is the master spirit of the Paris peace commission. Perhaps he is. Un questionably, Davis surpasses his col leagues in his admiration of England's colonial polltcy. He is one of the Amer ican statesmen who would govern the Philippine islands as England governs and can be thoroughly relied on to ad vocate any policy desired by. the pluto cratic classes.

Secretary of Agriculture Wilson, in his annual report says: "It is urgently ne cessary that congress should as speedily as possible provide a sufficient fund for the use of this department in making such investigations as may be necessary Into the agricultural resources and con ditions in Hawaii, Porto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines." What a hurry he is in for money to make investigations in our so-called colonial possessions! From all appearances he will hava to wait some time for the appropriation. Richard Barry O'Brien, the author of the recently published "Life of Parnell," a review of which appears on the first page of this Issue, is well known in Irish circles In London, of which city he has long been a resident. He is assistant editor of the London "Speaker," and is a barrister, occupying chambers in Lin coln's Inn, but is more widely known in connection with literature than with law. He was one of the founders of the Lon don Irish Literary Society, and has been a writer on Irish subjects for some twenty years past. The ex-Empress Eugenie seems to un derstand the real cause of the American Hispano war. In an interview with Mrs. C. K. Davis In Paris, she said: "After the destruction of the Maine war was inevitable, although I do not believe any Spaniard was responsible for that sad calamity. I am sure any nation wolild have done, under the circumstances, as the United States did." We are not in formed that Mrs. Davis made any at tempt to explain to "her majesty" that America was actuated solely by humani tarian motives In declaring war against the land of her birth. Some United States experts, including Prof. Becker and Dr. Knowlton, of the geological survey, and Prof. Holmes and Prof. McGee, the noted ethnologists, have lately made discoveries in Califor nia which place man's age at a million years. If the testimony which they col lected has any value, the earliest repre sentatives of mankind discovered up to date dwelt on the Pacific slope of the United States at a period not later than the middle of the tertiary epoch, tho mastodon, the rhinoceros and certain horses long since extinct being their companions. Col. Marcus Kavanaugh, of the Sev enth regiment, I. N. G., is evidently not related to Fr. Kavanaugh, the patriotic author of the history of '98. The Chi cago military man recently attended the banquet of the St. Andrew Society in the Windy City, and made a speech thereat, after drinking the health of Queen Vic toria, and listening to oratorical clap trap about the bravery and prowess of the glorious Anglo-Saxons, by a lot of degenerate Celts. John. F. Finerty truly says of him that "to aid in honor ing the English queen, in the midst of official Englishmen and slavish Scots, or in any place whatever, is to stultify the race from which he sprang." Queen Victoria's poet, Mr. Alfred Aus tin, has inflicted another of Ills effusions upon the literary world. Needless to say that it is on a par with his former pro ductions and does not rise above medi ocrity. Like Rudyard Kipling he does not believe that the czar desires pcace and good will among all nations. The following bellicose words in reference to England are found in the poem: Slowly as stirs a Hon from his bed. Lengthens his limbs and crisps his mane. Properly Interpreted, the poet-laureate means to say that Ihe couchant British lion is getting rampant for a tussle with the Russian bear. Of course the lion ex pects the American bird of freedom to aid him in the encounter. In referring to che d«mise by apoplexy of Rev. Roaring Kane in last week's edi tion we mistakenly confounded him with Johnston, of Ballykilbeg, a rampant Orangeman whose daughter had married a Roman Catholic despite her father's bigotry. It appears that Rev. It. R. Kane was not such a bad fellow after all. The Dublin Freeman's Journal &ays of him: Protestant champion and ultra loyalist as he was, there was a sood deal of the Celt about him. He was Impetu ous in his advocacy of principles that he held to be supreme, an.I there a touch of Irish vigor in his battle for the many lost-causes that he defended in his time. His death occurs at a. moment when he had gained upon our hearts in the Bouth by the bold stand that he made for justice to Ireland on the finan cial question. That proved that he had not wholly sunk his patriotism in the hot-house Imperialist sentiment cultivat ed in the north-east. His welcome in Dublin when he took his lace upon the mansion house platform, must have proved to him that the Irish Nationalist was not the terrible thing his imagina tion had portrayed. Sympathy with the cherished friends so suddenly bereaved will extend far below the Boyne. Many patriotic citizens had supposed, before there was a war with Spain, that this giant republic was the greatest and grandest and fairest on the face of God's earth and that It was capable of attend ing to its own affairs without the aid of other countries. If we are to believe the organs of Anglo-Saxondom we are not much of a power after all. They think it is absolutely indispensable for the United States to link its destinies with England and follow the example of the "motherland" In subgugatlng weak races by fire and sword Ipstead .of en couraging them to become free and In dependent by casting off the shackles of monarchy and governing themselves the best way they know how. The London Saturday Review auda ciously says: "The American commis sioners at Paris are making their bar gain, whether they realize it or not, under the protecting naval strength of England, and we shall expect a material quid pro quo for this assistance. We ex pect the United States to deal generous ly with Canada in the matter of tariffs, I and we expect to be remembered when the United States comes into possession of the Philippine islands, and, above all, we expect her assistance on the day, which is quickly approaching, when the future of China comes up for settle ment, for the young imperialist has en tered upon a path where It will require a strong friend, and a lasting friend ship between the two nations can be secured, not by frothy sentimentality on public platforms, but by substantial ad vantages in solid, substantial interests." Referring to our recent remarks on the altered tone of the Irish World, brought about by the Hay-Hanna-Mc Kinley regime, the Boston Republic says: Our Minnesota contemporary is altogeth er too innocent to be engaged in political discussions, or else its memory is sadly at fault. The Irish World has support ed every Republican candidate for pres ident since 1884. It supported Blaine, Harrison and McKinley. There were times when it seemed to waver, but be fore the battle was fairly on Its columns teemed with appeals to Irish sympathiz ers to vote for high protection and for the Republican candidates. This Is the policy which it has pur sued without variation for fourteen years. Like the Chicago Tribune, it is the most inveterate critic of the party while In power, but when the cry is rais ed to stand by the candidates Mr. Ford never fails to unite with the friends of plutocracy against the democratic masses. All its exhibitions of political Independence are made In years when there are no national elections. If Mr. McKinley secures the Republican nom ination in 1900 the Irish Standard will see the Irish World using its energy to re-elect him. If Col. Roosevelt carries off the prize Mr. Ford will be found booming, the Rough Rider. It has been ever thus. 

IRISH AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY. It* Prenlilent Spending a Few Days With C. D. O'Brien. Rt. Hon. Horace C. Plunkett, formerly member of parliament for Dublin, and now president of the Irish Agricultural Society, is in St. Paul, the guest of C. D. O'Brien. It is possible that Mr. Plunkett may deliver an address in that city or Minneapolis in the interest of the asso ciation which he represents, which alms to put the people of the Emerald Isle on an independent basis, independently rich if not independent politically. As yet the organization is not political, although it is expected by its promoters that as the beneficiaries of the new movement prosper and in their returning prosperity find time to study political questions, there will be more or less unity in their political beliefs. The key-note of the new movement is the introduction into Irish agriculture and manufacture, but especially in the former branch, of continental methods. The co-operative creamery for example, which has been for a number of years an established and successful feature of business in Denmark, has been Introduc ed into Ireland with very gratifying re sults. Co-operative stores, too, have been started. "The great obstacle we had to contend with," says Mr. Plunkett, "were, first, that the Irish people were suspicious of me. Second, that they were suspicious of each other." The reason why they were suspicious of Mr. Plunkett is that he is a Conservative, and therefore op posed to Irish self-government. Mr. Plunkett believes that poverty is to be blamed for the political subser viency of Ireland, to a large extent at least, and that with the enrichment of the people will come advanced political ideas and a corresponding betterment in their political condition. The diversifi cation of employments is being urged, as well as the application of co-operativa methods to both production and distri bution of the farm products. These are the essentials urged by the society of which he is president. Mr. Plunkett has been quite a traveler, having in his younger days been for a time engaged in ranching in Montana. Look at the label on your "paper and note the date thereon. Perhaps you are in arrears to The Irish Standard. A settlement of the same during the holi days will gladden the heart of the print er and bring joy to your own home as well. A laudable way of beginning the new year, you will admit v4 Ux ili -aft-, j"T"i t.i
