San Francisco, Dec. S. In accord ance with instructions reci-lved fro:n Attorney General Moody, I'nited Stat.-s Attorney Devlin this afternoon held a conference with President Aitman of the board of education. City Attorney Hurk and his assistants, Baggett and Williams, to discuss the question of the exclusion of the Japanese from schools attended by whites, with a view of ar ranging a suit to test the state statute requiring the segregation of children of Mongolian parentage in separate schools. The proceedings, technically known as a controversy withcut ac tion, will be brought in either the state supreme or the federal court. The points In dispute are practically agreed upon but the preparation of a statement of facts was postponed until Friday when Mr. Devlin will ascertain from Mr. Moody to which court th matter shall be submitted. Mr. Devlin said that while the issue resolves itself into a question of wheth er the state statute is a violation of the treaty rights of Japan, he is of the opinion that the law discriminates against the Japanese, Inasmuch as the German, Irish and other children for eign in parentage and descent, are not segregated, whereas " the treaty with Japan guarantees to the Japanese equal rights and privileges with aliens from other lands. An early decision is expected in the courts. BUY Buckeye Land AT $30 to $75 Per Acre

Inquiry today disclosed the fact that legal proceed ings to be taken today in San Fiancis co by the federal district, attorney in the matter of the admission of Japan ese to public schools without discrim ination were Inspired by Secretary Root who expressed an opinion that that would be one way effectually to dispose of the controversy. That the president's views on the subject met with the hearty approvnl of the Japanese government was made evident today, when Viscount Aoki, the Japanese ambassador, said he had per sonally thanked the president for what he said. The rumor that a new treaty between the United States and Janan was to be negotiated to remedy any de- j fects In the one now In force was set at rest today, when both Messrs. Aokl ' and Root unequivocally denied that 1 such a thing was contemplated.

The clear, firm and determined attitude of President Roosevelt in his message In reference j to the San Francisco school question, : and the anti-Japanese sentiment there, ; is warmly praised.

PRESIDENT'S MISUNDERSTAND ING. Sacramento, Dec. 5. Governor Pardee said tonight: "I don't think the presi dent understands the situation any more than other eastern people.

DELICATE MATTER. But President Wheeler Believes the Conclusion Will be Happy Berkeley, Dec. 5 President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the University of Cali fornia, said that in a large part he agreed with the president. "The real question disturbing us" said he. "con cerns the rapid immigration of Japan ese laborers and this question we know Is surely safe in the hands of the pres ident, who Is at once the well proven friend of Japan and In full sympathy with the needs and aspirations of the people of the Pacific coast. The Im migration of Japanese coolies will be restricted in the interest of conditions here. Japan will see that in its own Interest, but it is a delicate matter."

The banking bill has been one of the favorite measures of the west. The leaders of the house from that section are lined up generally In favor of this legislation, which It is asserted, would go far toward popularizing national banks. The opponents of the bill, dem ocrats and republicans. Insisted that real estate was not proper security for loans, even though a limit was placed. The advocates of the measure were too strong, however, and the bill was pass ed, two to one.

There is a Great Falling Off In the Later Ue ports of Estimates of Loss of Life and Damage to Property. x El Paso, Dec. 6. A Herald special from Clifton, the first authentic news of the Hood, says: "The river is re ceding rapidly, the weather has cleared and no further damage is apprehended. Two bodies have been recovered from the wreckage In Chase creek, but the number of deaths cannot be told. "Joe Throm, rescued from the flood, whose wife was lost, was taken to the hospital in a critical condition but will probably recover. Three Mexicans caught In the act of looting, who re fused to surrender to the otlleers, were shot and fatally wounded. The flood in Chase creek was caused by the breaking of the dam of the De troit Copper company, impounding a vast amount of tailings, which came down with a seven-foot breast. "Only one business house along Chase creek escaped damage and many were entirely d-'st roved. The loss is appalling. North Clifton is badly wrecked. Nearly all residences in that section are destroyed or damaged. "The Becker-Franx Mercantile com pany was damaged o the extent of 5I0.00iT. The Coroncdo railroad suf fered all the way from Clifton to Met calf and it will be several weeks be fore trains pass. "The first train out of Clifton start ed today. It is doubtful if It will reach Duncan, as the Gila river is almost aa high as in January and is still rising. "So many hotels and restaurants have been destroyed that it is almost impossible to- find a place to eat and sleep In the town but there will be no shortage of provisions, as many of the stores escaped the floods. "It is reported that the Arizona Cop per company will remove its, -plant to some other location but no announce ment has been made by the company. 1 he president and several directors are now" her. "All trains are held east of the river. The railroad bridges are so damaged that it will be impossible to use them for some time. The Herald office building was swept away and the Cop per Era was put out Tf business for a couple of weeks. The Era building was flooded to a dep'th of six feet and its plant was greatly damaged."
