TIIE PRESIDENTS message is not a great or brilliant one as messages go but it will be found more useful to Congress and the country than I the average document of the kind for while other Presidents have tried to indulge in fine writing Mr Arthur has confined himself to the presentation of facts figures aud suggestions in as few and plain words a3 possible Ordinarily the Presidents message is pretty dry reading It is generally understood I that editors and proofreaders are the only persons who actually and truly read them through and those unfortunate classes do not wade through the documents for the pleasure they find in them but be cause it is a part of their task The public generally can read Presi dent Arfchurss message and find in it interesting information DR
