H ; Salt Lake, Dec. Zi The -printer box- H , j tn?T season will bo ushered in next H Monday night at the Grand theatre H when Hardy K.

The an- H I nojincoments that this popular club H would reopen for tho winter mado a Hj i decided hit with the lovers of the Hj boxing game. PHI Manager Downing made a ten-strike H I wben he signed up Jess uren, meeiou- H , gated youngster who was tho sensa- H tion of the Manhattan club bouts laBt H ( winter, and Tom Crawford for the M hoadliner event, as both of these boys H are well known to every sport lover H in tho city and they all know that j " when they step through the ropes M there is going to be something doing t every minute of the four rounds. H : .Thcso two boys gave tho fans one of H ! 'the greatest whirlwind battles ever H i eecH at the home of the Manhattan H club last winter and tho fans have H j been aching for a chance to aco them H together again. Both have mot a num- H ber of good boys sinco they were seen H i - - I Bell-ans I Absolutely Removes H; Indigestion.

Another bout that promises to be almost as good as the main event will be tho semi-windup between Young Maloney, the fast Harman club boy. and Chris Romeo, the Greek boy. Both have appeared at tho club a num ber of times and have a great many friends. Komco has not boxed here for a year, but when ho appeared last he had all of the earmarks of a classy boy. He has had a number of bouts in the cast sinco he left here and de clares that ho has improved a hun dred per cent over his last perform ance hare. Jack Downey, the "white hope" an nihllator, as he -is sometimes called, 16 also going to have a tough job up holding his reputation when ho meets Jack Dempsey, a big. strong young fellow that battles from the timo the gong rings until tho bout is over. Downey will be no stranger to the roirniorx nt. tho Grand, as ho stopped a number of aspiring "white bopes' thero last winter. Ho has also been doing considerable boxing sinco he was last seen here and is determined to clean up all the heavies in this part. So far Downing has beon unable to land a suitable opponent for Kid Em mett, the fast Harman club feather weight, but he says in tho event that he does not land one this week he has another good pair of boys who are ready and will use Emmett at the next show. Cyclone Lefty, an old-time favorite at tho Manhattan club bouts will also be seen ia action against a newcom er from Portland by the name of Dun can. These two boys will furnish the pielimlnary. A pair of unknowns will furnish, tho curtain raiser and will no doubt fur nish more fun than scientific boxing, Downing says his display cards for the opening will bo out today and that tho seat sale will open Thursday morning at the same places as here- I I fa WlwiplSiR' You ,ove so music. $1 . y mSKmm ( Ever:body -5 Lwhy u I I fa fWi'M not cnoose for tne home SI H llfw ViUcaii m I IbHIiI Diamond Disc? .1 H '' K Kltf lEli liSSlIls In this perfected musical instru- VJ bbS I w ID l5c'll)mLllllli Tient, Mr. Edison has finally 1A1 H ! jl M ffitMM$)V solved all the difficulties vyhich I H ; !

Hope of athletes that baseball will be permanent' re tained as an intercollegiate sport In the western conference grew today with receipt of news that at four of tbo institutions there is strong senti ment against its abolition, as suggest ed by tbe faculty committee at Its meeting last Saturday. The senate of the University of Illi nois officially went on record as fav oring the retention of the game. Coaching and student sentiment at Chicago. Ohio State and Wisconsin, according to stories here, indicates that these three schools may refuse to follow the faculty committee's sug- gestion, Illinois' veto forces a reconsidera tion of tho vote by the conference committee before the universities themselves vote finally on it. The ruling of the advisory board of the "Big Nine" will not affect the return trip of the Waseda (Japan) baseball team next spring, according to Coach StaggoC the University of Chicago.

I WILSON NO MAN OF REAL ACTION Roosevelt Attacks President's Message dn Its Weak Utterances. Now York, Dec. 7. Former Presi dent Theodore Roosevelt tonight mado a bitter attack on President Wilson's message to congress, He said: "At the outset President Wilson, speaking of tho war, says: "Wo have stood apart, studiously neutral. It was our manifest duty to do so." Further on ho says: "We insist upon security in prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development. Wo do more than that wo demand it also for others." Later on ho says: "We regard war as a means of as sorting the rights of a people against aggression," and continuing, "We are fiercely jealous of aggression from without." Demands Explanation. wiiiit noes iu. wiiBun mean ucu in ono line he says that we have "stood apart, studiously neutral," be cause "It was our manifest duty to do so." and a couple of paragraphs later says that "We demand security in prosecuting their self-chosen lines of national development for others"? Ho can take either of the two posi tions, but he cannot take both. Did or did not Mr. Wilson demand se curity for Belgium to prosecute its aolf-choson lines of national develop ment? lie knows ho did not. Then what docs he mean by saying that "Wo demand this socurlty also for others"? Again, ho says that he regards war as a "means of asserting the rlghtB of the people against aggression," and yet he says that it was our duty to remain studiously neutral when Bel glum assertodthe rights of her peo ple by war against the aggression of Germans'. How does ho reconcile these two statements? Ho cannot do so. He Is using words to cover a policy of dishonorable inaction. Again, he says that we are "fiercely jealous of aggression from without." How did he show his "fierce jealousy" as regards the aggressions on the Lusltania and Ancona, which resulted in tho loss of several scores of lives and the jeopardy of hundreds of American lives? "Fierce Jealousy." How hag he shown his ' "fierce jealousy" as regards tho sixty or seventy soldiers wearing the Ameri- rvan uniform nnt in annalf at tVio women and children and civilians, killed or wounded on American soil by Mexican bullets? One symptom of his "fierce jeal ousy" to prevent "aggression -from without" was the Issuing of an order that our men should not fire back when fired upon. Does Mr. Wilson regard that order as "fierce jeal ousy?" It does not strike any other human being as such. Three years ago Mr. Wilson said he believed in tho policy of "pitiless publicity." Wo have never had as secretive an admin istration. The exact number of sollders of the United States army who have been killed or wounded by Mexicans can not be told, because Mr. Wilson won't permit the figures to be mado pub lic. Neither is it possible to obtain the exact numbers of the American meu, women and children who have beeu killed or outraged in person or prop erty in Mexico, because Mr. Wilson for three years has hindered all pub licity, pitiless or pitiful, about these uuuuijes in auexico, Not Man of Action. Mr. Wilson's elocution and Mr. Wil-' son's action are in flat contradiction. His elocution is that of a Byzantine logothote and Byzantine logothetes were not men of action. President. Wilson says that we have been put to the test in the case of Mexico and have "stood the test" and that we have applied a "heroic prin ciple to the case of Mexico." Of all possible adjectives that could be found in the English language by the most minute core upon the part of the most subtle dialectician, it would not be possible to find one more in appropriate to tho administration's course on Mexico thau the adjective "herolo." Nearly three years ago Mr. Wilson refused to recognize Huerta upon the ground that we were never to recog nize a government founded on vio lence. He then tentatively supported Villa, who represented tho embodi ment of violence; It being mean while asserted on behalf of the ad ministration that under no circum stances would he deal with Carranza, whose government likewise was founded on violence. The president has now eaten hiB words and recognized Carranza, and through his private secretary he has issued a defense of and an apology for the outrages committed by the Carranzalstas and by the other ban dlts of the other factions in Mexico, outrages as infamous as ever were committed by savages anywhere un-' der the sun. Mr. Wilson refused to employ the power of the United States to pro tect the lives of American men and the hopor of American women or to save thoBO wearing the United States uniform from death or 'from insult. Women Not Saved. He took no stepB to save Mexican and foreign women, including nuns married women and unmarried wom enwhen they were subjected to out rages and infamies which made the white slave traffic seem trivial by comparison. But he now uses the power of the United States to help ono set of bandits responsible for those infamies against another set. This is Mr. Wilson's definition or "heroic" conduct. It is his concep tion of "standing tho test." Such definitions and conceptions are inter esting only from the standpoint of adroit dialectics. In his present message President Wilson advocates as necessary cer tain propositions for putting this country in a state of preparedness to defend Itself against foreign aggres sion. In his mossage one year ago he said such propositions were hys terical and improper. T am glad that he has changed his mind: but I am sorry he has not taken the trouble to study the subject so as to make his proposals reasonably adequate to the country's need. His proposed enlargement of the regular army is utterably Inadequate. With certain of his statements it is almost Impossible to deal, simply be cause It seems incredible that their apparent and obvious meaning can bo their 'real meaning. I'or example, no says; q win uul maintain a standing army except for uses which are as necessary In time of peace as in time of war, and we shall always see to it that our military peace and establishment is no larger than is actually and contin ually needed for the uses of days in which no enemies move-against us. Stales Absurdity. What this moans I have no Idea, and T am certain that no ono else has any idea, including the president him self. What necessary' use have our forts and our coast guns "in time of peace?" How is our field artillery "continuously needed for the use of days when no enemies move against US'7" I ask these questions seriously. I defy any man to give me a seri ous answer which shall not show that tho statements are absurdities. Tho proposed "continental" army cannot produce good results. It is a proposal that a few of the young men of the country shall for two months every year abandon their work and in tho interest of the com mon defense train themselves to de fend their successful business rivals, who declined to abandon their work In (Continued on Page 3.)
