WASHINGTON. Seaond. Session of the Forty fifth Congress. COMMENTS ON THE MESSAGE. Criticisms and Commendations of Ref erences to Itie Smith. 0PESIH6 EIGHT l)H THE SECTIONAL ISSUE. Wood, Garfield, Ila le and Cox in Sharp Debate. THE GREENBACKERS IN COUNCIL Cipher Telegrams To Bo Investigated. FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. Washington. Dee. 2, 1878. THE MESSAGE AND HOW IT WAS DECEIVED? ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS ON THE SOUTHERN ELECTIONS. The Message is received with general but mild ap proval. Some people complain that it is a very unex citing document, but the general opinion is that this is one of its merits. The soft money men are, of course. Irritated at the passages relating to the cur rency. The Southern men. almost without exception, Are satisfied with the President's reference to the South And are disposed at this time to grant the money asked for to defray the expenses of trials lor violation of the election laws. It is probable, however, that there will be a lively discussion on this matter when ever it comes up. Mr. Stephens, of Georgia, this evening expressed to a Herai.i> correspondent what eocms to be the general Southern opinion of the Message. He said:? T'pcro the whole I think very well of the Message. Of course, I differ with the President upon his rtnan cial poliey. The Message "upon the subject of South ern outrages was not different from what I expected, t think, however, very exaggerated accounts have reached the President as to outrages in Kouth Caro lina and Louisiana, and when the facts come to be Inquired into it will be found that a grest deal of tbe newspaper statements sre totally without foundatiou. How it really is 1 do not know. One thing, however. 1 would say:? If there have been any outrages or violations of law they ought to be redressed. I am a law and order abiding man. The maintenance of the majesty of the law is tbe only hope of tbe preservation of the rights bt a free people. Government*. in the last resort, may be put into two classes?the government of laws an<T the government of arms?and all free people ought to eeo that the laws are executed and enforced, otherwise they must in the end have a government of arms. But I think in the Smith generally the election? were as free from illegal in terference as in any part of the United .states. In Georgia I never knew or heard ot a more, quiet elec tion. If in any of the recent elections to Congress State laws have .been violated. North by Houtli, the proper remedy ought to bo en forced through the State judiciary. If any federal law has been thus violated, the wrong should be righted through the federal judiciary, and as it is the duty of the Governors respectively to ace that fho State laws, as expounded by the Stat" courts, are en forced. so it is the duty of tbe President to see that the federal laws, as expounded by the federal courts, sre enforced. But mi>st of those questions, it seems to me, properly belong to the House of Representa ivee, which is the sole judge of the election and ualihcation of ita members. Mr. Wilson, of Wtat Virginia, old be wv a life-long democrat, but doubted Uie proprietyoT"rriHoUTngTBe Miangt for the suggestion!) abont the eloctiona in Boutb Carolina and Louisiana. As long as the act of Congress ia on tbo statutes ho said it was the flnfy of the President to see that the law was exe cuted. The fact that Mr. Hayes called attention to _rlection frauds in South Carolina and Louisiana and not to frauds in New York, spoken of by Mr. Wood to-day. cannot be considered an effort on Mr Hayes' fart to suppress any information as to New York elections, as bis attention was not called to tbem. Mr. Wood himself said there had been no pub licity given to then. Mr. Williams, of Michigan, democrat, thought that loo much space was devoted to intimidation in the South. He thought the President should have re. terred to intimidation at the North. In his district there were 2,500 employes in shops who were com pelled to vote as directed by their employers, other wise they would have been discharged. Judge Mayhcn, of New York, democrat, disapproved of the reference so strongly to Southern outrages. In bia opinion it was done as a lever in the elections in 18*0. Judge Reagan, of Texas, said that the reference to Southern matters was jn?t what he expected. Among the topics referred to in the Message which attract the attention of thoughtfnl members of both houses are the information that a new commercial treaty with Japan baa been framed and that measures ?re pending for more intimate commercial relations with South American States; the suggestion that In diana shall be enlisted as an auxiliary military force on tha Maine, which would, in the opinion of compe tent cxprrts, be one of the moat important and bene ficial measures for civilizing the Indians at a small cost; the recommendation to relieve tho pressure of businosa on the judicial courts, aud I he business on the federal courts and tbo Supreme Court, by the creation of ? number of additional circuit judges or by some other means, a relief which the judge# and the members of tha bar know to be very necesaary, ami the recommendation to construct a new tJoagresaional library building. The mere politicians evidently ted fantt because the Message deals ao much with the material interests of the ?ountry. but on that bead .the people will not agree with them. OPENING THE BALL ON THE SOrTKKBM AND FI NANCIAL QOBHIOOT* --DBMOCSATIO LEADERS SLENDERING. There is aornethtng frightfully tedious and monot inona about the folly of some of the democrats. They iegin anew precisely where they left off before. To day. for Instance^ when the Meaaage Bad been read in Uie House, Sir. S'ernande Wood, lu the capacity of leader of tha Bouse, dragged hie fellow democrats into a quagmire, and. with tha help of the previous question. left than sticking there. It (earned to Mr. Wood judicious to arraign tha President for the ex tremely moderate views of the Message on the South ern elections. Ha thought a great deal too much had beta said of what was of no consequence, and declared that tha extreme or rsd'ral wing of the republicans had captured tho President and made him vacillate in bis policy toward the South. Mr. Wood aniseed tnd startled the whole House, and delighted the re publican! a? much as ha diagusted moat of the demo crat*. He gave Mr. Oerlteld the opportunity to make t judicious and extremely effective rejoinder and Mr. Halo toe chance for a neat partisan appeal, and whereas, before he spoke, the extreme republicans had been disposed to gtowl at the Message and to quarrel with the President, Mr. Wood's remarks brought them all together. It must be aald. to tha credit of the democrats, that At 1c.ist three quarters of them aat In their seals Ailed with indignation and disgust at what thoy ?aw to be a groea blunder, and If Mr. Wood bad not, by the use' of the previous ?]Uoat|p>>, stopped discussion affer Mr. Cox had adroitly done all he could to cover up the mistake that had bean made, Mr. Wood would have heard some plain language* from his own aide. Several democrats aald after the adjournment that If tbey had had a chance they would have aald precisely what Mr. Garflcld said ou the questlou. aud there ia not tha least doubt that at least throe-quarters and probably seven eighths of the democratic aide were entirely content with what Uie President aald about tha South, The Southern men particularly were well aatlsffad, and would have toted et onoo tho additional money asked for in tbo Message to carry on tlie election trials. They ivy, very s< usihly, that those trial# before f< ilor?l courU will demonstrate to the country accurately, not only how much. but how little, disorder and wrong was committed anywhere in the South during the recent canvass and election. Tlicy are confident that in this way the exaggerated partisan accounts will be showu to be largely false, and that regular trial according to law ia tho best and only way to make the truth kuowu in the North, and they are not afraid of the truth. but .Mr. Wood does not stand alone. In the Senate Mr. JJcck. of Kentucky, means to-morrow to preaeut a resolution demanding of tho Secretary of the Treasury the reasons why ho lias not paid the inter est on the public debt with the silver dollars as far as they would go. Thus by Tuesday evening two prom inent democrats will have succeeded in reviving two of the questions which are most dangerous to their party au<l most disturbing to the country. Mean time Mr. biaiiie, not to be behind Mr. Wood, to-day brought in a resolution for a Congressional investi gation of the Southern elections. This can have, of course, only a partisan purpose, for tho whole matter is already under Judicial Inquiry, and if tho facts only were wanted it would be sufficient to await the result before the courts. There are signs here shewing that leading men in both parties think it useful to their selfish ends to keep alive the Southern question. Some democrats think this the only way to make sure of the Southern States for their party in 1RS0, and some republicans, 011 the other liaud, believe that they cannot keep the republican party alive until that tirno except by get ting up end keeping up a new quarrel and alarm about the South. Thus t]pso party leaders naturally play into each other's hands. THE GEXfelA AWARD?REPORT AND BILL 0T THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. At the desire of the Judiciary Committee the House, last Juno, fixed on tlio first Wednesday of the pres ent session for the consideration of the committee's report aud bill on the distribution of the Geneva award. Tho report, drawu up by Mr. Knott, the chairman of tho committee, is thought an able docu ment. The bill which accompanies it favors none of the claimants, but semis them all, the insurance men, tho war premium men and tho exculpated cruiser men, alike, to tho Court of Claims, with the right to appeal from its decision to the Supreme Court. This ought to be satisfactory to all classes of claimants, and it is to be hoped that the pasaage of the bill will remove the interminable dis pute fpom Congress, where It, has taken up valuable time fior the last six years to no purpose whatever, except to array members against each other on tho demand of some constituent who has a personal In terest. The government holds the money only ss a trustee, as lias always been confessed, and the nature of the different claims is such that only a court can decide between them. There is some hope that Mr. Potter's bill, which passed Jhe House at tho last session, will become a law before the 1th of March. That bill re fers all private claims whatever to the Court of Claims, and its passage would relieve Congyss of an immense mass of work for which it ia unfitted and greatly diminish tho lobby. FROM OUR REGULAR CORRESPONDENT. Washington, Dee. 2,1878, THE POTTER COMMITTEE?CIPHER TELEGRAMS TO RE INVESTIGATED. The members of the Potter Committee held a con ference to-day in the room of the House Committee on Military Affairs. The cipher telegrams were dis cussed, and it was agreed that the matter ought to be thoronghly investigated. Then the question of the authority of the com mittee to enter upon such investigation with out further power from the House was canvassed. No formal vote or action was taken, but it was de cided that tho original resotntion empower#! the committee to go Into everything connected with the Presidential election of 1878. Upon this view of the question the members determined to inquire into the cipher business, and a meeting of the committee will be called for Thursday to take formal and definite action in this direction. All the parties, both demo crats aud rapnhbeawa. who can throw ajyr light on the cipher despatches will be summoned to testify. CONGRESSMAN-ELECT MUBCH PROSECUTING HIS LABORS JN WASHINGTON. Congressman-elect, Murcli, ot Maine, delivered a speech to-night before the National Workingman's Assembly, au amalgamated body of the labor nniona of the District of Columbia. He ad vocated the proponed national- convention of delegate* from all the nniona of the country in Wash ington next March and expressed the belief that it would prove a success. Mr. Murrh has organized a union of stonecutters since bis arrival here and is taking an active interest in the labor organizations to wbicli, he says, lie principally owes his rooent suc cess over Mr. Eugene Hale. FOB THE BETTER PROTECTION OF GERMAN AMERICAN CITIZENS IN THEIR NATIVE COUN TRY. Mr. Cox, of New York, and Mr. Springer intend to introduce in the House, this week, resolutions look ing to tha better protection of naturalized American citizens in Gerfnany. The purpose of the resolutions is to terminate the Bancroft Treaty made in 18<W and restore the old treaty. Under tie Bancroft Treaty a German citizen of the United States who returns to bis native country aud remains two years becomes subject to the German laws in regard to military duty, while the old treaty protects him in all the rights ot an American, no matter how long he may remain in Ger many. provided he docs not renew Lis allegiance to that, country. The Bancroft Treaty was made for ten years, and provided that after that time either country might abrogate it by giving one year's notioe. The resolutions prepared contemplate giving Germany this notice through the proper channels. This subject has been brought to the attention of several Congressmen by petitions from naturalized citizens who have, while visiting Germany, been forced into military service. GENERAL V/ASHINGTON DESPATCHES. Washington, Dec. 2,1878. onEXKBAnans in secret session?thk bal ance eat POWER OlaAIMED IN THE NEXT CON GRESS. The greenbarkers held a meeting at the Metropoli tan Hotel this evening with cloeed doors. They claim sixteen members In the next Congress, who will act independently, not Joining ult/icr party in caucus, and that this number, as a balance of power, %!1 enable them to decide the Speaker ship and claim the clerkship and chair manships of important committees. They say that either Bering, of Ohio, or Kelly or Wright, of Pennsylvania, would be acceptable to them as Soaker, and that their preferences ' are for a demo it. They propose to maintain in Washington an office for thn distribution of political information, but do not, as has been stated, intend to start here a greenback organ. THE NATIONAL PAETT -MEETING OF THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ADDRESS ADOPTED. An adjourned meeting was held ia this city to-day of the members of the Central Executive Committee of the national party, at which an address was adopted signed by Peter Cooper, T. H. Murrh and E. K. Pierce, of Maine; G. Do Lamatyr, of Indiana; Samuel F. Cary. of Ohio, and others.

The party data* ita origin from the nomination of Pater Cooper for the ! Presidency in November, 187ft, and claims to hava Increased its vote from the 83,840 polled for Itim to 1,260,000 in the recent elections. The jwrtincnt ?|Urs firm is theu asked, "Can any doubt that a party which has developed such strength snd growth in two yeara can so perfect its organization as to elect the next President t" The people are warned that their republican government is in danger, and soma very fell designs sre attributed to the "money power." deferring to the banks, it is tsid, "The power of evil of these creations of the law, which i have sesumod io break an 1 annul the law, must l>e ! crushed." Agsin, referring to tlie motiej power, tho I sddross ssys: ? | That Insidious power irf at this moment seeking to i array the pe?p)? in a wicked ana ruinous contest on I Lie idea <'f a solid North against a solid South, well knowing that such ? contest is a nier>' pretext and 'over for ilieir real purpose, which is tbo continued nupreiafccy of the money power sn<l the further ruin ofthe people.

HOUSE OP WSPR ESENTATITES. Washington. Dec. 2, 187H. The sessten ef the House was opened with prsycr by thu chaplain, Rev. Mr. Harrisou. at tho conclusion of which the Speaker stated that this was the time fixed by the constitution for the opening of the third session of tho Forty-fifth Congress, and directed the roll of members and of Territorial delegatus to be called. While the roll was being called the members availed themselvea of the o]q>ortunity of greeting each other and renewing the acquaintanceship of last session. Orest cordiality was evinced on ail sides as congratulations or expressions of regret on the ivault* of the lste political campaign were exchanged. The galleries were crowded with spectators. The result of the cell showed that there were 229 members present, and thereupon the credentials of two member* elect?Mr. Bailey, to fill tho vacancy caused by the death of Mr. (juinn. of New York, and Mr. Majors, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Welch, of Nebraska?were presented snd ac cept! d without question, ind the osth of office?the Iron-clad? was administered to Messrs. Bailey end Majors. A committee oi (hres?Messrs. Atkins, Cox and Garfield?was appointed 10 join a like oonimittee of the Senate to wait upon the President and inform him that Congress was in session, and then, at twenty minutes to one o'clock, a recess was taken for one bout*. THE PRESIDENT'* MKS6AUE. At the expiration of the recess the President's Message wu? haudi.".! in by his private secretary, Mr. Rogers, and was thereupon read by the Clerk. COMMENTS or Mli. WOOD. I When the r< adiug of the Message waa ended Mr. j Wood, idem.) of N. Y? rose and moved that it be re- i ferred to tlie Committee of tho Whole House and Dr- | dercd printed. But first lie desired to make some comments upon it. Although, as a whole.thcdoc.u- . rneut was highly satisfactory, yet tbere were some I references in it which should be m?-'t at the earliest practicable moment. He referred to that part of it relating to the Sourbeni States. He (Mr. Wood) failed to see (what the President saw) any disposition in the South to a\oid or to annul in any degree tho recent constitutional amendments. Uc failed to see any indication in the South, at any election, at any time, under any circumstances, for a series of years,of un unwillingness to live in entire amity with the w hole country in regard to t he laws or to obey the government. He regretted that the President, who had commenced his administration with such a noble and patriotic position, a* against the military despotism exercised by his predecessor, should now indicate a change of policy. He had watched with interest the course of the edniinistration in order to see-whet her the President Would be forced from the Tuauly and noble position taken by him. He knew that there was a wing of fhc republican party dissatisfied with that position, and it had boon a matter of interest to tho whole country to know whether the Presi dent would continuously maintain his attitude. While the President expressed his views in v rry mild and very decorous language, yet he indicated unite cloarly that the condition of things in the South was not satisfactory to hiiu. The President had referred especially to the elections in Houth Carolina and J.oulaiaua. H# had been able only to single out two Stctos, and only two isolated instances in those States. That was an indication of vacillation on the .part of tho Executive, and it was only because it was such an indication that lie (Mr. Wood) felt it bis duty to declare that this was no foundation for the allega tion of wrong to the South. THE ELKl 

TJON IN NEW TOUT. It was to be regretted that, while the President's eyes were open to the Congressional elections iu South Carolina and LouWiftna. they were closed to what had occurred in the city of New York on the 5th of November, where, 4.bio legnl voters were dragged to prison by a government official, where hundreds of them were plunged into the vilest dens as common prisoners, nnd wlirre (besides those who had been ar rested) in.tvai other voteis liad been intimidated, thus making a difference of at least fifteen thousand votes in the city of New York in tlie last election. The President had not seen that. (Ironical laughter on the republican side.) Tho republican jiress of New York had not told that to the President, but it had pointed hiiu to the South. Ho (Mr. Wood) regretted that tho President had thought proper to lend his nigh position to the reiteration of misrepresentation, originated for him by the republi can press. He regretted it as an indication. He had the ulghcst regard for the President, liellevlng him to be an honest and patriotic man: It was n matter of profound regret that the President should permit himself to be an instrument in the hands of an ultra wing of the republican party. SErET or me. oAnriEi.D. Mr. Garfield, (rep.) of Ohio, replied to Mr. Wood. He characterised it us very unusual to interrupt the ordinary fortu or proceeding (which was simply to refer the President's Message and order its printing) by debating any of its suggestions, and he thought the V'nd of suggestions made by the gentleman from New York are still moro unusual. The exact language of that part of the Message with which the gentleman found fault was not. in liis (Mr. Garfield's) mind, but the gentleman's language was very plain. He (Mr. Wood) criticised certain references in ??he President's Message as to some disturbances in the course of a federal election in several States, contrasted that with what he. chose to call the noble beginning of the adminis tration in favor of self-government, and said that the President bad shown vacillation, because bo bad seen fit to refer to disturbances in a federal election. It Ibo right of a Slate to attend to its own local con cerns undisturbed was in any way inconsistent with the right of tlio national government to attend to national elections, and if that was what the gentleman called "vacillation," he hojied they should all "va cillate" in that way. He (Mr. Gar field) had never made himself a particu lar advocate or defender of any administration for lb* vacillation or want of vacillatien, but If tho gentle man (Mr. Wood) could make no better case against the aimlnistratton than he had made, he had not very well opened the ball "this winter." That 'cntlcmau could not see that there had been any db rb- -ice in matters of election?(after a pause)?m pi m hia own State. (laughter on the republican side.) He (Mr. Wood) lisd seen some signs?if not of disturbance, at least of "vacillation," in the city of his adoption and in liis State, but they were not such instances of "vacillation" as the gen tleman would have brought up In discussion. (f.Hughtcr.) It did not signify that the gentleman nad not seen any disturbances la the uational election elsewhere. If the President had seen tnom it wan the President's duty to say so, and the President had said SO in his Message. If the President had seen th-m and had not suiri sn he would not only have been gwttty of negligence hut of a positive fault. Tn? President had r.-fcrred to it modestly. He had invited the attentiou of Congress to it. Did the gentleman object to having attention pointed to it ifi that way ? Hod he or any gentleman on the other side any reason why he did not wish the atten tion of Congress pointed to the elections in the Ronth ern States t For his own part he welcomed such a celling of attention. Tho President ought to bo thanked for it by the gentleman from Now York, ?s it afforded an opportunity to him to havo this "vscll lution" examined into closely. THE ILLUML DISTURBANCES. Tie (Mr. Oarlleld) had had the impression made on hia mind, from a somewhat caretul reading of the public journals, that a very considerable illegal disturbance. had taken place in some of the Southern States. Ho had oven heard it stated that hold, open and acknowledged in timidation had been employed, notably in South Carolina and in districts where there had been an* overwhelming majority of one political party no sign of any such majority had appeared at all. This might 1)0 an exaggeration; if so it was one that was scattered broadcast through the public press and one which a Congress so notable as the present one for Investi , gating all chances of wrong doing should investigate, lie supposed (this sarcastically) that his friends on the other side would welcome fhe Prcaident's sugges tion as exactly in the line of their conduct hitherto. He hoped they would not attflc investigation. (Laugh ter aud applause on the repnblicsu side.) MK. WOOD'S KFJOrXDKH. Mr. Wood defended the position he had talcen, and repeated his expression of regret that the President had picked out two cases and duenuxl them of sul' ttcieiu importance to present theui to the world in his annual Message. It was an indication that the ' ultra wing of the republican party was forcing the hxocutivc to aid It in displaying the bloody shirt? (sarcastic laughter 011 the republican side)?so that the party could hold on to its ill-gotten power and continue that poser by the plunder ot the Treasury. si-EKc.it rnou Kvnr.xr. malic Mr. Hale, (rep.) of Me., condemned ths attempt on the part ot the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, the leader of the democratic side of the House, to belittle the subject matter which the President had fittingly brought to the attention of Congress. A British Ministry nad been often hurled from power for pcrtulttlug the violation of the rights of a single Brinish subject, either at honte or abroad, Hbsid and yet the iTCsident wae blamed because bo called attention to the deprivation of thousands of Ameri can citizens of their rights. The question would not and shonld not l>e allowed to he put down in that way. The President hud hwucstly and earn estly done in the directkiu of conciliation what many of his party friends believed in lust ire in withdrawing the troops froaithe South, but iu which other of His party friends sustained him, aud mi the heels ot it (here had tuken place iu South Carolina and 1'lorida and other Myiithrrn Htates what tne president had call ad the attention of Congress to. and now it was all-gist Ug the gdCtleinan trout New York that the President had lieeu drsgootn d by the radical a nig of the republican party into the course indi cated in bis Message, and that that wing of the party was likely to control the administration, lie would tell tho gentleman that ou the great fundamental doctrine of the protection of the citizen in all his rights there was no radical nor cotiser ra the wing in the republican party, but there wan one party in tho land uuited to a man on the proposition that tho American citisrn?North, Mouth and everywhere?should l?e protected in the exercise of hia constitutional rights. (Applaure.) ausstrr cox To rna uaevt. Mr. (.'ox, (dcm.) of N. f., declared himself tin a tone o( peculiarly feigned surprise) delighted to see his iriend fmui Maiue, uml wondered that that gentleman hod not complained of some of the vacillations in the state of Maine >uid Blaine. (Laughter.) His colleague (Wood) should not 1m censured ny the gentle men from Ohio and Maine ainiply bccanse he had expressed his regret that the President had lieen purblind for certain purposes; that he could see things in Mouth Carolina and Louisiana, but could not see tn? monstrous tyranny of his own olBecr in New York who had called in question the naturallcatiou of uO.OUO persons from IH&i t.) 1*7?. Had those gcntle lueu failed to remember how the "tape worm ticket" ot caiitornia hail been run by the Navy Yard ? Had tin y denounced the "tape worm" politics? Not much I He (Mr. Cox) was not respnhstble for the opening of tMa debate; but he shrank from no investigation into any election, North or Mouth. PrSMT MR.
