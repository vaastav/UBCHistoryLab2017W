Reforms in the Kongo, Liberia, Freedmen's Savings afcd Trust Company, and the Semi ? centennial of Negro freedom. .. To the first two the President adds' nothing not previously known to the! reading public. He sees in the an-' nounced program of reforms to be Instituted by Belgium in her African ^ Ikwsessions, "an augury for better' flings" for the natives who have suf ? fered for years to the private gain of of Leopold, the aged and profligate libertine who sits on Belgium's I throne. He recommends no relief for ! but will very likely have ' sa^ on this subject, of more J?than passing interest to Afro-Amer- j l\ leans, when he transmits to the Con the report of the Ldberian Com lssion. That the assigned claims of the Freedmen's Savings and Trust Com ' T * ' pany be not ^recognized, as President Taft suggests;, appears to the Advo cate as an injustice to those who have conie into possession of them in good faith; still th&*paper would welcome the incorporation of his suggestion in any measure looking to the relief of the Freedmen's bank depositors. The belief is very generally enter tained that the national government is morally bound to reimburse them, and that both President Taft and his predecessor are right in urging the Congress to do so. President Taft expresses ? himself more forcibly on the movement to celebrate the semi-centennial of Ne- ! gro freedom with an exposition. Gov- ? ernment aid is recommendefi to a3cer- ' tain the wisdom of such an exposi tion, and the authority to appoint a preliminary commission is requested. There is no question that this, President Taft's first message to a : regular Congress, is disappointing to ! those of the race who had hoped for some expression on lynching, dis franchisement and Jim Crowism. ? Criticism from that or any other I source would be, however, as vain as unwise. Vain because the message, is now beyond recall. Unwise because j presidential recommendations upon ' any of the^e subjects exert no influ- > ence tlpon either Senators or Cong-' Tessmem Predecessors of President Taft have delivered themselves time and again of beautifully worded sen tences dealing with these evils, but : the Congress, considering them as' designed merely to tickle the ear of the Negro voter, has winked its eye! and proceeded along the old, familiar -way. The states have not been influ ; enced to -repeal their anti-Negro laws, nor have the courts felt more disposed to iteglare them unconstitu HLiLf ?? mind, perhaps, Mr. tflthSugAt lo save himself time ?UiiL - I08! 1^K>r- doubtless felt that *rh$t far. /Roosevelt could not ac complish was useless for him to at tempt ASSAITiTNG THE 

PRESIDENT. Whatever has President Taft went and did to excite the ire of former Governor Francis D. Winston, of < North Carolina? ' The distinguished gentleman is re ported to have assailed "Big Bill" in an address before the North Caro lina Society of New York a few nights afeo, "as unqualified to speak on the Negro problem at the South." ?-'.V ? For what? 'There is surely nothing in the pub * He expression of the President to which the most rabid Southerner can take offence. On the contrary, his leanings are so decidedly towards the prejudices of that section that the ^ ,.JS tejjro people have begun to ask themselves if Bryan could have beer worse. Mr. Taft has assured the south that he will make no appoint foments down there objectionable tc tfee people. Jn other words, no Negr< will be placed in an office where th< white people do not want him. Hii addresses to the Negroes have beei but platitudes. admonitions to be come law-abiding citizens, advice t< acquire education and wealth, warn lugs' against the pittfalls which base the race. What is there In such talk to dis qualify a man from speaking at th south, north or any other point o the compass? The truth Is that former Ooverno ( Winston Is either lamentably ignc id i ) ? ? W7f' ' v. Tfcft'a attitude toward the 0iHo the gentleman delib erately sought to deceive hie hearers. |Bven after his message to Congress, ^e^Jsjiansiderable difficulty iu cat Ajog^iag.j?ie present occupant of the Whitfc'l ^ouee. It is unjust to pass judgement until both sides of the question are heard; but, according to thes Evidence submitted thus far, one la.t Inclined to think that Mr. Tatt's lAne will be that of the least re sistance.' As in the settlement (if it is settled) of the tariff question and the Interior Department squabble, so it may prove as regards the Negro, a straddle; nothing radical; a sort of better-leave-well-enough-alone policy. THE 

POST OX WASHINGTON. Through the kindness of a local j white admirer of Dr. Booker T. Wash ; ington, The Advocate presents to its readers what is undoubtedly one of the highest tributes ever piaid him who, if laudation affected, would not I be the character he is. | It is not, however, so much on ac count of what the Post says about Dr. Washington, for his position in Amer ican life has long since been estab lished, as for the information point ing to the more amicable relations between the races, that the Post's editorial is here reprinted. Thinking men of both races have always held that if the white news papers of the south could be brought to bear down less heavily upon the Negro's shortcomings, and to place greater stress on his efforts at ad vancement, they would do much to lessen the tension and harmonize in terests which conflict only because of hostile publicity. The Post states that the Memphis Commercial- Appeal the Nashville Banner and the Colum bia (S. State are all making projj*. ress in this direction. A small num ber, it Is true, of the many newspa pers published at the south, but "ev ery little bit helps." When papers of the wide influence of those men tioned exhibit the courage to brea4t away from the conventions, the estab lished institutions of their section, and exercise the freedom of expres- ' sion enjoyed by the press at the North, evidences are not wanting for an approaching era of good will. f THE RED CROSS STAMP. To those of our readers who plan to make Christmas presents ? and who of them does not? ? we call at- 1 tention to the Red Cross Stamps to had for one cent at any first class store, drug store especially. With the funds derived from the 1 sale of these stamps the National j Red Cross Society wages war on tu-j berculosis, the most formidable foe ! to humanity. The Negro race being j particularly susceptible to its ravages should let no opportunity pass to i contribute to the defense. ! Purchase a supply of these stamps, | if you would aid the cause. Place j them on the wrapper of your Christ- ; mas gifts, stick them on your letters; with the required postage stamps, J ask your friends to do likewise, thus enlisting in a crusade having for its i o-bject more merit than those which I would capture the Sepulchre from the' Moslem horde. OITR ACTUAL. NEEI). What the NegTO race actually needs ; along through these narrows is not : so darn many leaders, but a few more I followers; not so many silver tongued > I orators with solutions of the race ' problem always on tap, as a few more , men who can and will do things that i count ? build houses, establish busi nesses, buy property. The race has now as many leaders as the south has colonels, and the ti tles of the fovmer are about as well founded as those of the latter, but they are not near so picturesque, though the usefulness or uselessness of the two classes are on par. CLIMB IN OR ELSE, The exposition project of Dr. Wash ington and the National Negro Busi i ness League to commemorate the promulgation of the Emancipation I Proclamation and to show the prog ? ress of the Negro people in America, having received the endorsement of President Taft, the Georgia and Chi cago promoters will kindly climb In to the band-wagon or "go way back and sit down." ; !

Washington '8 latest speaking tour Id the south 'emphasises again his gr^at usefulness to the whole coun try. ^In this role as an interpreter of one race to another, pleading for harmony, mutual. respect, and >ustice,1 he is performing a patriotic service which it would be hard to overesti mate. One of the foremost white educators now at work in the south exclaimed on hearing of the details of Mr. Washington's recent trip through Tennessee: "Now I believe tjhqre is going to be a revolution in :the south In favor of the Negro." Of j the fifty thousand persons who, ac 'cording to the estimate of the spe cial correspondent of this newspaper with Mr. Washington attending his meetings, nearly one-half were white; and in every case he was received v(ith an enthusiasm which would have turned the head of any less bal . anced and sagacious leader. | Lest we be accused of exaggeration we would remind our readers that Judge Floyd Estill, at Winchester, Tennessee, introduced Washington, the Negro, once a homeless and desti tute wanderer, as a "fine type of the true southern gentlemen"; that Judge J. H. Price, another typical southern er of high position, classed Booker Washington with the first President, with Thomas Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, Lee and other Virginia worthies, as among that state's most distinguished sons; and that Judge J. M. Steen of the Circuit Court in troduced Mr. Washington with these words: I "We believe that as the patriarchs of old were inspired by God to lead their people out of darkness into light, to guide them on the right road to right living and success, so ho who is to speak to us tonight is in spired to lead his race to higher, bet ter things. But his message is not f for you alone. It is not alone for this city or this state. By helping you-he helps us; by helping you tie helps every man, woman and child ill_alL_ this abroad land of ours." All of this is enough to make any man accustomed to the ravings of the ordinary southern office-seeker, or firebrand lecturer of the Tillman or der, rub his eyes and ask whether a revolution is not actually at hand. Yet these compliments to Mr. Wash ington toy such men of prominence ought not to surprise us. It is just! the better self of the south coming' to the fron,t. Men like the ju 3ges j we have quoted have come to see that if the races are to live in peace! and comfort, the Negroes, who are 1 progressing, who are laboring in Mr. ? Washington's spirit, must be sus- ! tained and upheld. More and more, i too, men of standing are bound to recognize the obligation the south! owes to the Negro. Speaking at* Brownsville in Mr. Washington's j presence, Judge John R. Bond, of the Tennessee Circuit Court said: "1 1 was born and reared here in the j south, and have associated all my j life with Negroes. I feel that as a southern white man I owe a debt tp the Negro I can never repay." His \ gratitude was specially for the way in which the Negroes protected and cared for the white women and chil dren who were left at home during the war. But there is even a higher and more sacred obligation than that I ?the duty of caring for the back ward race because it is backward, and of helping it onward and upward. A man who would injure a defective or crippled child must be an utter outcast from society; the time will' come when all nations will take a similar attitude toward those human beings who are handicapped, particu larly if, as in the <5ase of our Negro, _their plight is largely no fault of their own. . . To Uiis quiet but ever present ap peal the true southern gentleman is bound to respond because he has a heart, because essentially he believes in fair play, and because he is ?n American. Further proof of this lies in the space given to Mr. Wash ington's trip in South Carolina, in Virginia, in Mississippi, and now in Tennessee, by the newspapers of those sections. The Tennessee press has yielded to Mr. Was-vn 2-ton it* first pages and reported his speeches in full, even where the proceedings called for four or my;e cobmnis. At Charleston, last winter, the prominent editors joined the Mayor in welcoming the colored orator; in Tennessee the r? rli to rs have sat upon hi* platforms. More than tin t, the Memphis Cora mercial-Appe i1 has recently honored itself and its p ofessio i by instruct ing its correspondent to bear down as lightly as possible on Negro crime and to say as much as pos>H>li about Negro betterment. The Nashvi'.ie Banner is aar.n.r jo'imal that in do:n; its b^st to be i?iat to the .Woo and trying not to lay undue stress upon the crimes of the rascals who unfortunately disgrace their race ? just as there are plenty of white men who do the devil's work. The Col umbia State has also long battled for fair play; recently it has incurred un fair criticism, for denouncing the un just punishment of a Negro because he was a Negro. To come back to Mr. Washington, the greatest service ho can render to day is plainly not at Tuskegee, and not at the White House conferring as to appointments, but on the stump in the south. His bearing and pop ularity enable white men to speak out freely where it would sometime be ! * "*-T V T. 1 'Associate \of Chl*agot madft v|(?o4 profits out of corners in wheat, and cotton, may now bel sieved -wit^ a desire to foiW up4 the I prHW of Wones.
