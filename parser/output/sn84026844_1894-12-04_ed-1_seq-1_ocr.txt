[OwriohUd, IBM. by the AuoeiaUd Preu.] ATM**, Grsbce, Dec. 3.?The Asaooiled Press, exclusively, has been able to pre to the world tho facts of the terrible atrocities perpetrated upon Armenian Christians in Asia Miaor, and today srepreaeututive of the Associated Prssi succeeded in obtaining additional dstails confirming the statements preTiattily made. Tbe representative tods; met twenty Armenian refugees who arrived here from Armenia, after a journey fall of hardships ami sutleringi. With every mark of horror and iodig nation the Armenians told ?n interpreter of the scenes they had witnessed. The Istter thoroughly crow-questioned tbe fugitives in order that tiiere ihoold be no doubt as to the accuracy of their atories. The moat of tbe persons who told their stories to The Associated Press today escaped from Moosh, Bitliu and Sasaouo, taking with them what littio thev could carry, and making tlieir way with the greatest difficulty to the Ru*so*Turkiih frontier and going to Erivaa and Eicbtniadiin. Several Armenian women escaped from the villages with the party which jus srrired here, but when near Krxeroum thsy died from the effects of itbre wounds inflicted upon them belore their escape. TOE SECOND MASSACRE. For about eighteen mouths the Armenian refugees say the province of Kaaaoun has been surrouuded by Turkjib troops,and nobody has been allowed to outer it or to leave it. About four months ago the Turkish authorities learned that the inhabitants of Vartemia, a village outside the frontier of Sasionn, were sending for the neceasarI iea of life to the village of Dalvorig. fench communication between the two | villages boing prohibited, the Turks muiacred nearly all the inhabitants ot I V.ri.mi. Thin uraa th? iirermd maaaa I ere to occur. The first took place about ayearatjo. Doe of the refugees, a man named Kbadjik, stato? that his uncle and aunt were among the killed, the latter being | violated previous to being put to death. He adds that an Armenian priest, named Kevont. was killed for refusing it to celebrate 'l'urkish rites in his church at Vartemie. The village contained 325 Armenian bouses before the Turks attacked it, but when the fugitives left only twenty-five houses remained standDtlvorie, it appears, is the largest village in the province of Soasoun, and ita inhabitants, when they learned of & horror perpetrated by tho Turks at Yartemia, attacked the Turks on tho frontier. The Turkish commander eventually sent twelve soldiers into Dalvori* in order to learn what had occurred. The Armenians, filled with tuuigDaiigu uv tiie mruuiuuo toimuiuuu by the Tarks at Vurtemis, attacked this detachment of Turkish soldiers and put them all to death. AS AWFUL VBXOBANCI. When the Turkish commander heard o! the death of his eoldiera, ho deternaiaed upon avenpinR it ia the most bloody manner possible. A strong lores of Turkish troops was sent to the illtge with artillery and the massacre bejraa. Gum kept op a continuous firms upon DeUeriir, until practically not ooe none was left standing on another. Belt, the hey of Initzoun, a Kurd,with a detachment* of Turkish cavalry, wont with the Turkish eoldiera to the village of Semul and forcibly took the Armenian priest from his church after diegaitlnxly defiling the sacrod vessels and the priest's hands. They then bound Win on a donkey, which they drove a distance of a few vardt. The soldiers then fired at the priost and killed him nd the boast he was bound to. In the same village tho Turkish soldiers entered an Armenian hoti'o and violated a woman and her dauphtor, the latter being 14 vears of aste. From this village Selo forcibly look eight Armenian girls and scut thorn to his harem at Initxoun. Farther atrocities wcro committed by the Turks at the villaso of Keiiohuzen. Before dawn this place was surrounded DV nl'linr. ?n.l _u:u tl.. *ere still asleep it was set on lire. PKAUPUL CRtMKS. At Keliohuzen, tho soldiers killed*tho Armenian priest, Marmot, who, with tliftty other inmates of a house, was turned to death, the aoldiera prevent?t anybody from escaping from the cumins: dwellings. The chief of the Ullage of Cbeneg waa captured by tho soldiers and bound to hie two (laughtort. All threo were thon scalded to death with boiling water. A detachment of twenty-fivo regulars ?' tho Turkish cavalry, after committing [jexpreisible horrors at tho village of Kebgbank, went to tho villugo school od ravished the girla found there. The cavalrymen then devastated tho building. IboHev, a notorious Kurd brigand of jjevlllneeof Djibrati, and a colonel in lt>e retrulsr army, went with a detachJjont of Turkish troops to tho Armenian v,utgesol bullion, Hatozgontaud Komk ja at each place tbey committed evory ?r?ne which itwaapoMible to commit. I After driving out tho men. they collected the female children nf Baiilou, Nether about 200 in all, and after rnv' hing them, they killed them all with KQQ? and swords. */ter tho inoaiaere, tho Turkish and whatever else they could find in the village. MA!fV VILAOES DEVASTATED. The Kurdish regular iroope from Kizan and Bah ran entered the Arms nian villages of Aliandrig and Aghteg, killed the inhabitants and wrecked their houses. Tho number of villages devastated in this manner is said to be thirty-two. Tho Armenians fled in every possiblo direction, but many of tbeox were captured by the Turkish troops belore itiey could (ret away aud were taken prisoner* Khadjik, who wai the principal spokesman oi the Armenian refugees, told the whole story in a moat convincing manner. Dr. G. TJicumaian, a well known Armenian, has just received a letter, written on September li'J, from Todorian, a village nesr Erzeroam. Tho writer ays: "How can I writoof the horrors of our life for tho days since the fourteenth. Mounted robbers rode up to this village an hour after sunset and immediately began in<li<criininato attacks upon the Armenian inhabitants. Over two hundred shots were tired at the house of the Rev. Mr. Zaokiss, pastor of the Protestant community, who tfaa absent in Erzeroam. Three bails struck tho pastor's wife in the face, She sub seqnentiy uiea irora uio uaects 01 nor wounua. borne poor people from Kiinoos, who were living ia ibe batemeat of the pastor's bouse, hurried upstaira when the firing was going on and all of them were wounded. On September 25, a band of robbers committed , murder at Andag, and carried olT cattle. At Dobyt they broke into homes and plundered them of their contents." Dr. Thoumain, the recipient of the above letter, was formerly a professor at the American college at Marsovan, and has himself been the victim of cruel persecution at the hands of the Turks. SHOT HIS SWK15THKAKT. Samuel Self I'robubly Fatally Shoot* Minn Emma Wat* on Dccau?o She llefuaetl to Marry Dim. Special Dliwtch to the Intelligencer. Weston, W. Va., Dec. 3.?At Roanoke, ten miles south of here, to-day, occurred a sensational shooting affair which will probably result in the deatfe of one Miss Emma Watson. A young man named Sam Self, alias Sam Green, had long loved her and had often told her so, and asked her to become his wife. They attended the same school, and this afternoon they started homo together. Aa they wero walking for a diitanceof throo or four hundred yards through a field, he pressed his claim again, all to no purposa Finally they came to a fence through svhich was an opening, the top rail beinginpoaition. Self anked /or a final answer, and it caine in uio negative, ne aieppeu uacK as it' to let her pais through the fence, and as she stooped to pass under the top rail he drew from his pocket a pistol, shot her through the head and tied. Immediately a warrant was sworn out and a posse started in search, of the fugitive. It was after a lively chase that ho was captured. The feeling in the community ?rew so hiifh that lynching was feared, and the ofticcrs telephoned to Prosecuting Attorney AleGary to know what they should do with the prisoner. They were advised to start at once with him to the county jail at this place, and a constable with a number of well armed guards is now conducting him to jail on horseback. The young woman is in a critical condition and it is very 'questionable whether or not sho can recover. FATAL WKEOK, An Ezpreaa Meutoftr nail Mall Affect Drowned In Lake Chnraplnln. Wiiitiihall, N.

C.t Dec. 3.?Following are the main point* of the President's annual message, tranamittod to Congress this afternoon: 

MEDIATION BETtVEK* CUI.VA AJ?'D JAPAN*. A ratifying recognition of uniform impartiality of this country toward for- 1 eign states was manifested by the coin- i oident request of tUe Chineie and Japa- 1 nese governments that the agents of the j United States should within proper limits aflord protection to the subjects of j the otber during tho suspension of diplomatic relations due to a state of war. This delicate office was accepted. A misapprehension, which gave rise to belief that in atfording this kindly office . our government would exercise the same authority which the withdrawn agent of ttie beligerants had exercised, was promptly corrected. Although the war between China and Japan endangered no policy of the United Statos it ( deserves our gravest consideration by reason of its disturbance of our growing commercial interest* in tho two countries and the increased dangers . which may result to our citizens domi ciled or sojourning in tho interior of China. Acting under a stipulation in our ( treaty with Korea (the first concluded with a western powor) I felt con- j strained at tho beginning of the contro- . versy to tender our good offices to in- : duce an amicable arrangomeut of the initial difficulty growing out of tho Jap- ( nnese demands for administrative re- t forms in Korea, but the unhappy precipitation of actual hostilities deiealed this kindly purpose. Deploring this destructive war be- . tween the two moit powerful of tho ( eastern nations, and anxious that our commercial interests in those two countries may be preserved, and that the safety of our citizens there may not be j jeopardized, I would not hesitate to (* heed any intimation that our friendly ] aid for the honorable termination of hostilities would he acceptable to both belligorents. GERMANY, OUR CATTLX AND THE TARIFF. Acting upon the reportod Texas fever in cargoes of American cattle, the German prohibition against importations of live stock from this country has been revived. Itis hoped Germany will soon become convinced that the same is needless, as it is harmful to mutual interests. The German government has protested against the provision of the customs tariff act which imposes a discriminating duty of one-tenth of one c4nt a Dound on sugars coming from countries paying an oxport bounty thereon, claiming that the exaction of such duty is in contravention of articles 5 and 9 of the treaty of 1828 with Prussia. In the interests of the commerce of both countries, and to avoid even the accusation of treaty violation, I recommend the ropeal of so much of the statute as imposes that duty, and invite uttention to tho accompanying report ot tho Bocrotary of state containing a discussion of the questions raised by the German protest. TflB SEAL CONTROVERSY. Early in the present year an agreement was reached with Groat Britain concerning instructions to be given to the naval commanders of the two gov ernmenta in Uehring tea and the contiguous North Pacific ocean for their I guidance in the execution of the award < of the Paris tribunal of arbitration aud * tho enforcement of the regulations I therein proscribed for the protection of I aoal life in the*watcrs mentioned. An 1 understanding has also been reachod 1 for tho pnyinont by tho Unitod States ' of $250,000 in full satisfaction of nil J claims which may be inndo by Great 1 Britain for damages growing out of tho < controversy as to fur seals in Bohring 1 sea or seizure of British vessels engaged J in taking seal in these waters. Tho i award and findings of tho Paris tribunal i to a groat extent determined tho facts and principles upon which thesoclaims * should be adjusted and thoy havo been * subjected by both governments to " thorough examination upon tho prin- 1 ciples as well as facts which they in- * volvo. I am convinced that a settle- 1 merit upon tho terms mentioned would 1 be an equitable und advantagooui ono t and 1 recommend that provision bo } made for prompt pavmont of stated f sum. Thus far only I-ranee and Portu* 1 gal have signified their willingness to adhere to the regulations established c under award of tho Paris tribunal of ' arbitration. Preliminary surveys of the t Alaskan boundary and a preparatory J examination of tho question of proteo- I tion of food fish in contiguous witters of tho United Mates and the Dominion of Canada aro in progress.

OUR MKARJCfT SOCTHSRK *E10HB0B. Good will, fastened by many interests n common, has marked our relations with our noareat southern neighbor. Peace being restored along her northern rontier, Mexico has asked the punish* neot of the late disturber# of her rsnquility. There ought to be a new reaty ol commcrce and navigation with uai country 10 ibko me pi act) 01 tuo uuo which terminated thirteen years ago. Lbe friendliness of the intercourse be* ;ween tbo two countries is atteated by ;he fact that daring thia ions period .ho commerce of each hat eteadily injreased under the rule of mutual conlideration, being neither stimulated by :onventional arrangements nor retarded ay jealous rivalries or selfish distrust. An indemnity tendered by Mexico as i gracious act for tJio murder in 1887 of Loon Baldwin, an American citizen, by i band of inaraudere in Durango, baa Qeen ncoepted and is being paid in in* lUlmonia. The problem of the storage and use of the waters of the Rio Grande for irritation should bo solved by appro* [mate concurrent action of the two in* terested countries. the ijluefields incident. Prominent among the questions of the rear was the Muefields incident, in vhatis known as tho Mosquito Indian itrips bordering on tbo Atlantic ocean ind within the juriadictionof Nicaragua. By the treaty of .1860 betweed Great Britain and Nicaragua the former gov?rnment expressly recognized the bovjreiarnty of thelatter over the strips and i limited form ot self government was guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians to >e exercised according to their customs or themselves aud other dwellers within ts limits. The so called native governnent which grew to be largely made up aliens, for many years disputed the loveroignity of Nicaragua over the strip ind claimed the right to maintain herein a practically independent muni:ipal uovernment. Early in the past /ear oQorts of Nicaragua to maintain tovereignty over the Moiqnito territory ed to serious disturbance culminating n the suppression of the native governnent and the attempted nubatitution of in impracticable composite administra* ,10a, in wuicuuiiiaiaiiua auu ohb? ??o?lents were to participate. Failure was ollowed by an insurrection which lor a ime subverted Nicaraguan rule, expeling her officers and restoring the old jrgani/.atioiu This in turn, gave place ;o the existing local government estabished and upheld by Nicaragua. Although the alien interests so arayed against Nicaragua in these trans* ictionH have been large American, and hecomraorce of thai region for some ,imo has been and still is controlled by >ur citizous, wo cannot for that reason :halleuge the rightful sovereignity of Sicaragua over this important part of ler domain. For some months two of mr naval ships have boon stationed at Bluefiolda for the protection of all legiti* uato interests of our citizens. In Sepember last the government at Maragua >xoelled from ita territory twelve or nore foreigners, including two Ameri t -II 1 in illlB, IUI Ulll'^CU paiMbll/amuu iu ?uu leditiou* or revolutionary movements igainat the Republic at Bluefields, aleady mentioned. But through the arneat romoustration of thin governnent tho two Americans have been lermitted to return to the peaceful nnnagement of their business. Our naval commanders at the scenes >f the disturbance, by their constant exhibition of firmness and pood judgment, contributed largely to the provenion of more serious consequences and ,o the restoration of quiet and order. I egret that in tho midst of these occur ences there happened a most grave ind irritating failure of-Nicaragna jusice. An American citizen named Wilson, residing at Kama in the Mosjuito territory, was murdered by one \rgnello, tbe acting governor of the town. After some delay the murderer ivas arrested, but so i nsecurely confined )r guarded that he escaped, and notwithstanding our repeated demands, it s claimod that his recapture has been mposstble by roaton of his flight berond Nicarauguan jurisdiction. The S'icarauguan authorities having notice )f forfeiture of their concession to tho :ompany on grounds surely technical ind ombracod in the contract have re:eded from that position. Unreasonableand unjust fines imposed )y Spain on tho vessels and commerce >f tho United btates have demanded rom timo to timo during the last twenty years earnest remonstrance on the lari of our governor. In the immediate last exarbitant penalties have been imjoaod upon our vessels and goods by he customs authorities of Cuba ancl ?

This couiuct is in strango contrast with tho conlidorato and liboral treatment extended o Spanish vessels and carjoos in our >orts in like cases. No satisfactory sotlenient ol those vexation questions lias ret beon reached. Tho .Mora case, roerred to in ray last annual message, renains unsettled. From tho diplomatic correspondence, in this subject, which lias been laid be*' oro the senate, it will bo seen that this rovornment has oftlirod to conclude a louveution with Spain for disposal by irbitrntion of outstanding claims he* ween tin* two countrios, except tho Hera claim, which having been lorn; tdjustod, only awaits payment as stipu* ated, and of 'courso it could not bo intituled in the pronosod convention.

Early in the day the corridors began to fill with the crowd which ia always attracted by the assembling of Congress. Thore was added interest owing to the political revolution which had recently occurred. Hut it was not a struggling ma*s of humanity such as some times marks tho great evente of Congress. The President's message waa to be presented in both houses, and this meant that there could be no sharp debates as the roadmg clerks would have the floor for two hours or more during the reading of the message. The crowd seemod to be drawn mainly to tne bouse end of the capitol, as it was here that the recent political storm had made its marks most apparent. The galleries were well filled though not overcrowded, and tho spectators showed an eager interest in the arrival of each conspicuous figure on the door. Congressional veterans who had spent a good share of their life in the house of representatives came into it for their final session, the recent tidal wave baving retired most of the leaders of the majority. But there wero few disconsolate faces among the defeated and they joined with the members of tho minority in good-natured sallies across the middle ai<lo, which is the political deadline. Kepresentative llolmau, of Indiana, wan one of the first to put in an appearance. He greetod warmly his old friends and then went to his seat and busied himself with the business of the day. Occasionally there was a round of applause to home leader of note made his appearance. The best known ones?Reed, Wilson, Bland and burrows, were not among ine cariy arrival! and the galleries were in exf?ect?ncy until the?e party favorites put n an appearance. At the senate end of the capital there was another crowd which filled the galleries without crowding. A now rule had boon put in oporation limiting the reserved galleries to the use of those personally introduced by senators, inHtoad of those holding cards of admission. The senators wore late in arriving and some of those who had boon most conspicuous iu recent public event*, notublv Senator Hill, of New York, were absent. The usual dignity and decorum which mark* all senate proceedings kept the galleries from showiug those manifestations of approval which marked the opening of the house session. TUB 

SENATE. The reassembling of the United Stales senate was devoid of dramatic incident. The reading of the President's message consumed two hours and was the only business of importance transacted beyond the presentation of several resolutions calling for information concerning the recent issue of bonds, the use of federal troops at the Chicago strike, and as to Armenian and Chinese atrocities. These brought out no debate, however, and the interest of the day centered in the President's message, it tram imtAnad to "with attention, al though it brought out no demonstration of approval or otherwise from the senators or spectators.. 

TIIE nODflK. The opening of the abort session in the houae was pictureique in a way, but devoid of interesting feat urea. The galleries were crowded, and half the desks on the floor wero smothered with flowers. Tbo leadora on both aides Rot enthusiastic rocoptiona from their rcapective purtisan?, the appearance of Speaker Crisp, ex-Speaker Heed, Mr, Wilson and Mr. Burrows being the ( signal for long and loud outbursts. Tliero was no chance in the first day's j proceedings for any public reforenco to the election, so that the actual pro* cecdings wero dull and uninteresting. Heven now members were sworn in, and aftor a long wait, the President's raes- 1 aajje was road. Although listened to attentively, it wai concluded without a aingle mark of i approval or disapproval. The death of j tho late Representative Wright, of Pennsylvania, was then announced, wheieupon the house, as a mark of respect, adjourned. I
