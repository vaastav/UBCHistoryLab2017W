President Harri son today sent to the senate a letter from the secretary of state, enclosing a copy of the first annual report of William E. Curtis, director of the bureau of American republics, ilr Curtis says that the im mense number of applications received for information about the South American countries give ampie evidence of the awakened interest in the commerce and conditions of neighboring countries, and is encouraging to those who are endeavor ing to promoto the social and commercial relations of the American republics. The report refers to the rapidly increasing export trade to the Central and South American republics and says that many United States manufacturers who never before attempted to sell merchandise in the southern continent are now sending agents into those markets to introduce their goods. The merchants of Mexico, Central and South America, who have heretofore purchased goods in Europe ex clusively, aro now coming to the United States. The recently negotiatea reci procity arrangements, it is said, also affords them opportunities that are be ginning to be understood and appreciated. Mr. Curtis refers to tho work under taken by the bureau, of interesting the governments and peoples of Latin America in tho World's Columbian exposition. The invitations extended to them to participate in the exposition have, he says, been cor dially accepted by every republic and col ony. Nearly every one of tho southern republics will erect upon the exposition grouuds a building of its own, upon a design typical of its peculiar architecture, and surround it with practical illustrations ofthelifo and industries of its people. The bureau has been enabled to prepare for the exhibition at Chicago an historical collection, illustrating tho discovery, con quest and settlement of Latin America, and the colonial period and epoch of revo lution for independence. It is nlso proposed, Mr. Curtis says, to prepare for the exposition a commercial exhibit, illustrating the various classes of merchandise best adapted to tho wants and most acceptable to the tastes of con sumers in Mexico, Central and South America and tho West Indies. This ex hibit, it is proposed, at the close of the exposition, shall be permanently estab lished cither in Washington or New York.

WEATHER PREDICTIONS. Washington, Dec 15. The department of agriculture proposes to introduce an improvement in the weather bureau ser vice. The predictions heretofore made were based on observations at S a. m. and B p. m., and were made for twenty four hours from the timo of the observations taken. These predictions aro necessarily a little belated, as it was several hours be fore they could be placed before the pub lic Those published in the tnorniuc ia- pers were for a time which had already pers were ior a time wuicn nail already nearly half expired, and for the evening papers the case was still worse. The nro- poscd Improvement consists in having the predictions in each case cover the time till midnight of the ucxt day. When this takes effect, which will "be Jinuary 1, next, the predictions printed in tue morn ing papers will appear early in the day to which they apply, while those in the even ing papers will be for the dav after. By this plan the needs of the public will be more fully met. JUDGE CULBERSON DECLINES. Washington, Dec 1C The Post will say tomorrow: "Representative Culberson has second time declined the position of interstate lommerce commissioner.

Shields will succeed Judge Thayer. A COINAGE BILL. New Yokk, Dec. 10 According to the World, it is pretty certain that a bill for the free coinago of silver in some form will pass the Democratic house and Republi can benate during the present session. The plan practically agreed upon by those who will control the matter in the house is briefly this: To stop all purchases of sil ver by the government; to throw open the mints to the free coinuge of all silver here after to be produced from American mine3, and to uuard against the unloading of for eign silver upon us by a system of notifi cation and inspection similar to that de vised for guarding sugar bounties. The dispatch also says that Speaker Crisp has decided to make Mr. Bland chairman of the committee on coinage, and that a ma jority of the members will be advocates of free silver. 

HOUSE. Washington, Dec 1G. The opening of the house today was without special Inter est. It was generally understood that no business would be transacted, and that tho meeting would be merely a perfunctory one, to enable the speaker to appoint the committee on rules. Speculation was rife as to the composition of - that committee and there was quite a large attendance of members, but their time was principally engaged in conversation with applicants for minor positions, whom they politely referred to the officers controlling tho var ious departments ot the house. Speaker Crisp, apparently no worse for the cold from which he has been suffering for the past few days, called the house to order, and there was no deviation from the pro gram which had been mapped out. SENATE. Washington, Dec. 16. Among the com munications preseuted and referred were numerous memorials against the Sunday opening of the world's fair. Some of them favored" the loan of $5,000,000 on that con dition. A number of bills of no great importance were introduced. Mr.Stewart gavenoticethathe would.on Monday, address the senate on that por tion of the president's message relating to free coiuage. Adjourned. THE 

SEAL FISHERIES. San Francisco, Dec. 1G. Ounalaska advices to Dec. 5, have been received here, by the United States revenue cutter Rush, which has returned from Bering sea. The advices state that with the de parture of the seals southward an oppor tunity was given for inspecting the rook eries on the seal islands, aud that more than ten thousand jouug seals were fouud dead, apparently from starvation. Tho indiscriminate slaughter of seals without regard to sex, it is contended, de prived the joung seals of their dams and of their natural sustenance. CAPITAL NOTES. Washington, Dec. 16 The Democratic caucus committee held a session this morning and practically completed its labor iu the assignment of the minority representation upon tho senate commit tees. The list will be submitted for tho approval of the caucus in a day or two. Representative Mansur of Missouri, while descending the stairs leading from his rooms at Willard's hotel last evening, slipped and sustained a severe strain of the right hip. It will probably confine him to his room for some days. The treasury department today pur chased 70.S00 ounces of silver at prices ranging from $0.95i5 to $9570. The following nominations were con firmed by tho senate today: Lorenzo Crouuz of NebrasKa, assistant secretary of the treasury. William D. Owen of Indiana, superin tendent of immigration.

Bills were introduced in the senate to day providing for a subsistence depart ment of tho army, to i-eotg.inizo the artillery branch of tho army, to increase the efficiency of the army, and to define the grade of medical officers of the army. ANOTHER COY DUCK. Washington, Dec. 16. The New York Daily Advertises yesterday morning print ed a long interview which makes "one of tho ex-president's warmest and most con fidential friends" say that Mr. Cleveland does not desire and is not working for the presidential nomination. Iu answer to the question whether he would take the nomi nation if it were offered to him, the friend is quoted as sayiug: "That is another question, and it would depend upon who might press him. to take it. I do not believe that what we might call a popular request not even a national convention tender would influence him. Ho has strong antinatby to entering another campaign, a decided dislike to the cares aud worrinients tnat beset not only the candidate, but the elected. If tho leading men of the party men who represent different party ideas that are deemed momontous in the preseut Btato of politics should unite and convince him that his candidacy would embody a vital principle of tho party, that he would have united support and that ho would represent all that the party has at stake, he might probably be Induced to run, but even that would be against his will. He has hail the honor of the presidency. Could a re-election add to that honor? If Cleveland and Harrison were, to start upon a journey through the country today the crowds that might gather to greet the passing train would be as enthusiastio for Cleveland, the ex-president, as for Harrison, the president. I tell you, the honor of the presidential office is exhausted in one occupancy as it Ls in any other office, and Cleveland realizes this truth."

Tho general pas senger agents at their meeting killed the Alton boycott and devised a new scheme to prevent the payment of commissions on passenger traffic. It is proposed that each railroad concerned in the abolition of pas senger commissions shall make arrange ments with its connecting lines to enforce tho agreement. Each lino receiving a cer tain amount of passenger traffic from an other line shall direct an equal percentage of its own passenger business over that other line. By this plan it is expected that every railroad agent will be made the watchful guardian against the offering of any inducement calculated to give one road an advantage over another. Two thirds of the general passenger agents in the meeting voted in favor of this plan, aud it will be considered at a meeting of the Trunk Line and Central Traffic associ ations' joint committee, to be held about a fortnight hence. Chicago, Dec. 16. Chairman Finley has been notified that the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis road has made a re duction of $2 in winter tourist rates to southern points, because the Missouri Pacific met tho rates from Fort Scott. It is claimed that tho Missouri Pacific is carrying passengers via St. Louis, enabling them to buy tickets to Pleasant Hill, Mo., and repurchase here, making tho through rate less than that quoted from Kansas City. Chairman Finley communicated with General Passenger Agent Townsend of the Missouri Pacific on the subject, but that official promptly replied that he should meet any rate made by tho Mem phis line. Washington, Dec 16.

"W. Day, of the Rock Island, has two corps of engineers making a survey for the propos ed extension of the Rock Island road through the Indian Territory, aud the sur veyors have progressed about seventy miles through Rush Springs in the Terri tory in the direction of Gainsville, Tex. A proposition is being considered for survey ing the line to Waco, Tex., by which Wuco will become the immediate terminus of the new line, the board of trade guarantee ing to the Rock Island the surrender of all the rights and franchises of the Gulf, Bta zos Valley and Pacific railway. This would give tho Rock Island a complete lino along the upper Brazos "Valley to Waco and thence southeast to the mouth of.the Brazos river. The proposition to this effect is now in the hands of tho exec utive committed of the- board of directors of the Rock Island road. A BE0KEN BALL.

Miller, a well known i;rain man. made a tour of all the railroad freight offices ye-torday morning in the interest of the gram trade of the west, which is seriously affected by the car famine. At no office could he cet any reliable information as to when the block ade would be raised, but the Canadian Southern people thought it would be loosened up by the end of the week. There appenrs to be profound ignorance a to the probability of getting a supply ot car, aud about all the consolation the freibt agents have to offer is: "The blockade must cad some Uine; it cannot last Al ways." "As a result of this blockade," said Mr. Miller. "Chicago, St. Louis and Peori have dropped the price of No. 3 corn 3 cents a bushel. These are the only mar kets open to Nebraska, because our rail road will not allow their cars to go be yond their own line, and the manipulators of those three markets have taken ad vantage of the situation to rob the west of thousands of dollars.

THE MISS0TJKI EIVER. Proceedings of the Improvement Conven tion at Kansas City. Kansas City. Dec 16. Governor Thay er called the Missouri river improvement congress to order at 10:30 o'clock this morning. The report of the committee on rules aud order of business was presented and adopted without debate. W. F. Switzer of Missouri then address ed the convention. He spoke of tho Louisiana purchase and read from his re port at the time he was chief of the bureau of commerce and statistics. His address showed the importance, from all stand- Eoints. of the country included-within the ounds of the purchase. Mr. Berlin of the Missouri river commis sion next spoke. He said that the com mission would gladty give any action the congress took ita profoundest considera tion. The first thing to be done was to obtain an adequate appropriation for the work. The commission had fought against local appropriations and had sought to get a sufficiently large approriation to begin with and contttrne tho work in a systom- fatic manner until it was completed. The report of the commission stated that tue Missouri river could be made to answer all the requirements of commerce, but enough money must be appropriated to finish the work. Governor Francis next addressed the convention. He spoke of the great im portance to the west of the improvement of the Missouri river. Last September the congressmen of Missouri, the Missouri river commission and himself had in spected the improvements at tho mouth of the Osage. The congressmen had de cided that the policy of tho commission was the correct one and favored an appro priation for the f ntnre work of improve ment of tho stream, beginning with the mouth and working up. The United States had assumed control of tho water ways, and it was crimiual in the national government to neglect the great water ways. The price of grain was fixed by the cost of transportation. A cent saved in tranportation was a cent for the producer; a cent added to the cost cf transportation was a cent added not only to the price of everv bushel exnorted but to every bushel raised. Tho state commission nnd the Missouri state law, in the event of the im provement of tho river, would not only force the rates alone the river down, but would also reduce all railroad rates in tho state. The resolutions were unanimously adopted at the afternoon session. Several independent resolutions were presented, but none of them found favor with the convention, except ona endorsing Kansas City a-? the place for holding the coming Democratic national convention. That resolution was adopted. A resolution also prevailed to make the organization perma nent, and a nermanent executive commit tee was appointed. Those representing Missouri are Isaac M. Mason of St. Louis and G. F. Putnam of Kansas City. Kan sas is represented by T. Dwight Thacher of Topeka and George W. Martin of Kan sas City, Kan. Adjourned sine die. THE FEDERATION OF LABOR.

Thews comprise tbe conference committee for the preliminary work of the meeting, and were instructed to wait upon the League at Ui meeting and ascerdn Ja-it what ort of a proposition the Leagoe would make. With thui step the Associa tion halted. Tbe arrival of Nicfc Young j of the League put the League officials on a wording utis. uuu cw o u uwv iucy (,u. together in tbe club room of the Bate? House.

Tho ouly con troversy will be over Louisville. Columbus may take the plum, but it is doubtful. The other clubs will remain as stated heretofore The Chicago association backers have been set down upon com pletely, though they still remaiu and have dim hopes of preventing a consolidation. Tho league does not anticipate having affairs its own way, and it has shrewdly given its committee sufficient latitude to sottle amicably almost all the questions anticipated to arise. Tho association, all through, has shown a disposition to meet the league half way in all propositions. The immediate appointment of tho pea' e committee at the tirst session showed this. Since, yesterday there have been no con ferences of any sort of the association del egates. President Phelps called a meeting this evening, but, the committee not being ready to report, the meeting was ad journed. The general plan for n consolidation of the two organizations is now practically' mapped out. The joint conference of the two committees was finished tonight. The association peeace committee met tonight with the association delegates. Tho com mittee recommended the adoption of the twelve-club league plan. After the adop tion of this recommendation the Associa tion adjourned. Tho leaguo did not hold a session tonight, but had practically ar ranged all the details of tbe plan iu pre vious meetings. A joint conference of tho two organizations will be hold tomorrow. A SEA
