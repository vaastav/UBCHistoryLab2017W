President Roosevelt's last annual message, much heralded as the admin istration classic, was read to congress today, and is. in substance, printed in Tti • Evening Statesman today. Reading the message convinces one that President Roosevelt has grown tired, vi ry tired of directing the af fairs of the nation. Instead of lx*ing the lofty summary of things done and things attempted during his adminis tration, which v. as wM:«r the forecast ers Eaid the message would be, thr paper Impresses one as having been written with the same spirit Ss is shown by the schoolboy who is made to turn In an "essay" after his play mates have been released for the day. In tiiis message Mr. Roosevelt had nothing to say. Only the law which requires the president to report to congress each year is the excuse for the paper. En its dreary details there arc many recommendations, but they are recommendations which have been made b fort, and the vigorous Roose velt style does not arouse one as it did in its earlier days. In the message, in its original form, there is page after page, of reading de scriptive of the disaster which has befallen China as a result of its care lessness in the matter of its forests— rather vivid descriptions of the denu dation of the empire, descriptions which on their face were written not' in the White House, but in China. From this it would seem that the pres ident has inserted bodily a long dis sertation on for-strv prepared by some expert on forestry after a careful study of conditions in the Chinese empire. All of which is good reading, although hardly to be expected in a retiring I resident's last annual message. That the presidency is a big job is generally supposed; that it is a bigger job than is the ordinary man who is caned upon to nil it is probab'y true. Mr Roosevelt went to the presidency in the prime of vigorous manhood. Whatever his admirers may say, the fact remains that after seven years' service he leaves the presidency a much weakened man. In a purely politi cal way he has accomplished much. He has left a Roosevelt Imprint upon current history: he has appointed his own successor and made his name a watchword for the incoming adminis tration. But in a purely physical and mental way he has lost that which it is doubtful if a year's rest in the Afri can jungles will restore to him. If you don't believe this, read today's message to congress, and compare it with Mr. Roosevelt's earlier state pa- P rs. 

MORE ABOUT CASTRO. The temptation to romantic specula tion about the movements of Presi dent Castro of Venezuela is very great. Circumstances and his temperament combine to surround him with fascin ating mystery. He has an inexhausti ble capacity for giving the world dis agreeable surprises. All countries that l aye anything to do with that Which he governs have learned to ex pect the worst from him. Taking everything into account, his latest personal movements have been followed by international gossip with 1 ss than its usual fertility of romance. The carefully framed story that his life depends upon going to Berlin for a sergical operation is held languidly in suspcns( without either accepting or rejecting it. The real motives put ; n place of it are hardly worthy of inter national intervention. The various versions of the old South American story that he is fleeing from an impending revolution to live on mil lions he has secretly sent ahead of him to Paris are not worthy of a man with such an original genius. The least the world has the right to expect from Castro is that he should bring his me teoric career to an end in some new and startling way. It would make a better story, with just as much foundation of fact and probability, to suppose that he is at the end of his rope in his tangle of quarrels with foreign powers and is on a secret mission to seek protection from the rest by throwing himself into the arms of one of them. His destina tion i s Berlin, though he approaches it circuitously and seems to be driven or by the inhosnitaiity of France. Wry not suppose that he contem plates a secret meeting with the kaiser and hopes to make some kind of deal for their common advantage. JUST AN AGREEMENT. Although strict constructionists — and democrats these days are strict constroctionistfl —will see a technical violat on of the constitution of the United States in the "notes" which have just been exchanged between the secretary of state and the Japan ese ambassador, and although sdme precedent-respecting senators will probably help fid the congressional record with "remarks" on the subject, the chances are that this new trea ; y which is not a treaty will stand as a virtual arrangement between tha two governments. It is now naively ex plained that this interchange of notes is not a treaty, but is merely a statement of the mutual attitude of the present Japanese ministry and the present American administration. It does not become law in this coun try, like a treaty signed and ratified, it binds n. ither government except so far as future governments may desire to be bound by it. This gives it greater moral force than would be lodged in a treaty so guarded as not to transgress constitutional limitations and so softened as to obtain the rati fication of the senate. So long as both governments re main in the same mind, the agreement will be useful as a noties to other • ow. r- that the integrity and dependence of China and the posses sions of Japan and the United States in the Pacific cannot be menaced with impunity. But if either nat on was to change its mind, after making secret pa j rations for eventuaiit'es, it could be called to account only in the pr.m itive tribunal of arms. There would be no ground for appeal even to the moral s nse of nations. Nevertheless such a statement of a national attitude deliberately taken and strongly supported by public opin ion has tremendous moral force. The famous Monroe doctrine began with a still more informal exchange of diplo matic notes and never has gone- farth er than reiteration in the messages of presidents, it has no standing in law and no government could take steps to execute or enforce it without- en abling legislation. That is exactly the situation of the United States government in relation to tile subject-, coveicd by the agree - men with Japan. No future govern ment is either bound by it or empow ered to execute it, as the case now .-lands. But witli the same public opinion behind it, it might control the destinies' of the Pacific ocean as the Monroe Doct.ane has controlled the destinies of the American conti nent. 

AMUSEMENTS Florence Roberts. To the biggest house of the year, Florence Roberts in, the "House of Bondage" was presented at the Keylor Grand last night, and to most of those who saw the play, it proved a disap pointment. The pay is cumbersome In its writing, has too little action and to much talk and gives Florence Rob erts little chance to show what kind of an actress she really is. The tal ented actress is popular here, but it would be refreshing if she should ap pear in a play worthy of her. "The House of Bondage" should never have been staged. It iacks en tirely the movement necessary to success, is too "ta'ky," and presents its problems in a way that is not vita) nor convincing-. . The lines them selves are clever and would make ex ce lent reading, but by the production of the play Miss Roberts adds nothing to her position—it gives her no chance for the reaPy excellent work of which she is capable. Seymour Obermer, the author, has seeming y, tried to handle his subject after the manner of Ibsen— and has fai'ed. It is a play that appeals to few, has no excuse for being alive. The strong situations are given to the seconds and the leading parts have little chance for display. It was an entire disappointment to many; and to those who liked it it was lacking in much. "THE GREAT DIVIDE." The Henry Miller company has T ; **■*• f~ «c ■nain? in X production of "The Great Divide" which will be the attraction at the Keylcr Grand theater soon. The cast is one of uniform excellence and includes only artists of ability who have made great reputations in the theatrical world. Miss Mabel Brown ell, who assumes the -part of Ruth '"Jordan" in the play is the actress who crented the difficult role of "the wife" (now being- played by Margaret Ill'ngton) in "The Thief which was presented all last season at the Ly cum theater. New York. Thi- yon lady ha« Peon PBder w**h Henry Miller for the past two years, and was "loaned" to Mr. Frohman for the Metropolitan engagement in Bernstein's drama, Mr. Miller in ex pressing his opinion of this young woman's abMity. ha« not hesitate-* saying that it is his earnest belief that in Miss Brownell we have the fu THE EVENING STATESMAN, WALLA WALLA, WASHINGTON. ture great American actress. Edwin Mordant, who is the "Stephen Ghent in the play, is an actor who comes by his ability by heritage. His father Edwin Mordant, Sr., was considered the peer of all character actors on the English speaking stage in the time when Booth and Barrett were in their prime. Miss Delia Knight, who plays the part of "Polly Jordan" al though a girl in her teens, has ac complished as much in her short ca reer of less than three years on the stage a s th? average actress does in a life time. After winning the scholar ship and medal of a prominent Chica go school of elocution and art she became the leading woman at the College theater, Chicago, and it was there that her work came under the direct attention of WJliam Vauehn Modify (author of "The Great Divide") who communicated his 'Und 'to -AT. Miller and in turn was authorized to engage Miss Knight at once. Those who have seen M-iss Knight play "Polly" say that her performance is a most delightful one and creates a lasting impression upon the auditor. The other members of the cast of the play that has been termed by the press of the country as "The Long Awaited Great American Play," in clude such prominent people as Fred erick Forrester, Wm. H. Boyd, Daniel Pennell, Frank Wi lard, J. L. Clarke, George Mason, George Kingston, G. K. Schillinger. Phillip Bronsor., Charles Simpson, Frederick Gilbert and Mrs. C. W. Brooks. This great dramatic scenic success will be presented at the Keylor Grand theater on December 10. "Little Johnny Jones." On y the largest cities in America had an opportunity last season of wit nessing ' Little Johnny Jones," George M. Cohan's very successful musical melodrama. That the p'.ay will be pre sented in this city soon at the Key'or Grand theater has interested our the ater-goers to such an extent that the demand for seats has been unusual ly large. "Little Johnny Jones" is prom ised as one of the most pretentious musical productions of the past dozen years and one of the most beautiful from a scenic standpoint on tour this season. It is in three acts and four scenes and wil] be presented here with the same massive and rea istic scen ery as seen for six months in New York last season anil over four months in Chicago. The cast is a notable one. while the company numbers, with principals and chorus, 75 people. "Charley's Aunt" Soon.

Message Continued from Fage One) ing the effectiveness of war against crime it could not have been better devised to this end. It forbade the practices that had been followed to a greater or less extent by the executive heads of various departments for 20 years. To these practices we owe the securing of the evidence which enabled us to drive great lotteries out of busi ness and secure a quarter of a mil lion of dollars in fines from their pro moters. These practices have enabled us to discover some of the most out rageous frauds in -connection with the theft of government land and govern ment timber by great corporations and by individuals. These practices have enabled us to get some of the evidence indispensable in order to secure the conviction of the wea'thiest and most formidable criminals with whom the government has to deal, both those operating in vio'ation of the anti trust law and others. The amend ment in question was of benefit to no one excepting to those criminals, and it scrious'y hampers the government in the detection of crime and the se curing of justice. Moreover, it not only effects departments outside of the treasury but it tends to hamper the secretary of the treasury himself in the effort to utilize the employees of his department so as to best meet the requirements of the public service. It forbids him from preventing frauds upon the customs service, from inves tigating irregularities in branch mints and assay offices, and has seriously cripp'ed him. It prevents the promo tion of employees in the secret service, and this further discourages good ef fort. In its present from the restric tion operates only to the advantage of the criminal, of the wrongdoer. The chief argument in favor of the provi sion was that the congressmen did not themselves wish to be investigated by secret service men. Very little of such investigation has been done in the past; but it is true that the work of the secret service agents was partly res ponsible for the indictment and con viction "of a senator and a congress man for land frauds in Oregon. Ido not believe that it is in the public interest to protect criminals in any branch of the public service, and ex actly as we have again and again dur ing the past seven years prosecuted and convicted such criminals who were in the executive branch of the govern ment, so in my beiier we should be given amp c means to prosecute them if found in the legislative branch. But if this is not considered, desirable a special exception could be made in the law prohibiting the use of the secret service force in investigating members of the congress. It would be far bet ter to do this than to do what actually was done, and strive to prevent or at least to hamper effective action against criminals by the executive branch of the government. Postal Savings Banks. ' I again renew my recommendations | for postal savings banks, for deposit ing savings with the security of the government behind them. The object is to encourage thrift and economy in I the wage-earner and person of mod- crate means. In 14 states the deposits lin the savings banks as reported to the comtroller of the currency amount to $3,590,245,402, or 98.4 per cent of the entire deposits, while in the re maining 32 states there are only $70,- -308.543. or 1.6 per cent, showing con clusively that there are many locali ties in the United States where suffi cient opportunity is not given to the people to deposit their savings. The result is that money is kept in in hiding and unemployed. It ie believed that in the aggre gate vast sums of money would be brought into circu'ation through the instrumentality of the postal sav ings banks. While there are only L -453 savings banks' reporting to the comptroller there are more than 61,- -000 postoffices, 40,000 of which are money order offices. Postal savings banks nre now in operation in practi cal'y all the great civilized countries with the exception of the United States. Parce' Post.
