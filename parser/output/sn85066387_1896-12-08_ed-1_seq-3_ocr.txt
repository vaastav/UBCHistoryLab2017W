CUJLLI JOJt I'ALMEit. linthrr Frigid Ilecrption at the Bands of Mirer Jtrinncratic >>enator*. WASHINGTON, D.\C, Dec. 7.— Senator Palmer, late Gold Money Democratic can didate for President, received a frigid re ception at the hands of the Silver Demo cratic Senators. His former friends, like Senators Jones, Cockrell, Pascoe and Vest, showed extreme coldness toward the juniot Illinois Senator. Republican Sen ators noticed it, stepped into the breach and were effusive in their greeting. The studied effort on the part of the silverites to avoid Senator Palmer was the subject of a quiet conference in the rear of the Senate chamber between Vilas, Gray and Palmer during the reading of the Presi dent's message. The isolation of the Gold Democratic Senators was so marlced that people in the galleries noticed it and it soon became the subject of gossip in the restaurants and lobbies. HUN 

TING TON'S MEN ON HAND. They Will Make a Desperate Effort to Pass the Refunding Bill at This Session. WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 7.— lt is generally believed among Californians here that Mr. Huntington will make a desperate effort to pass his refunding bill at this session of Congress, and they are very anxious for Senator White to get here and help Senator Morgan fight the bill in the upper house. Repreßesentative Grove L. Johnson and John Boyd, Huntington's right-hand man, had a long talk to-night at the Hotel Regent. Judge Maguire said to The Call corre spondent to-night: -'The indications are that a speedy and determined effort is to be made to pass the funding bill in both houses. My information to-night is that Senator Gear will call the matter up in the Senate at tbe earliest possible moment and endeavor to secure its passage there tirst. If this be true no time is to be lost in preparing for the battle here. I am assured to-night that nearly all the Demo crats in the House will vote against re funding tbe Pacific railroad's debt. The exceptions are among the gold Democrats who refuse to recognize the Chicago plat form. Fortunately they are few and far between." SUICIDE OF OWEN O'CONNOR. The Real Estate Dealer, the Thirty-Ninth Witness in the Cronin Murder Trial, to Die. CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 7.— Henry Owen O'Connor, a real estate dealer here, com mitted suicide at his home, 4507 Wabash avenue, this afternoon by shooting him self through the heart. He was interested to a considerable extent in stocks and was identified with Marcus Daly in some of the latter's large holdings in Montana. A few days ago he had expressed his in tention of leaving for Wilcox, Ariz., where he is interested in mining property, and had made all tbe preparations for the de parture. This afternoon he asked his wife to go to the drugstore for some medicine, and he shot himself during her absence. He is well known in real estate circles in Chicago, and it is supposed that ill health and business complications led him to take his life. Before doing the act he wrote a note to his wife. O'Connor was active on the side of the prosecution in the Cronin murder and is the thirty-ninth witness who has died. He leaves no chil dren. ALL BANDS ON A STRIKE. Presstnen t Compositors and Bookbind ers Join in a Walkout. CHICAGO. 111., Dec. 7.— One hundred and fifty pressmen, compositors, book binders and press-feeders are now out on strike at the printing establishment of Donohue & Hennebery. Thirty press feeders went out in sympathy this morn ing. The strike originated with the com positors because the firm refused to dis charge an objectionable foreman, but the company is also accused of breaking its contract with the Typographical Union relating to the employment of a certain number of union men. Non-union men were put to work in place of the strikers and a large number were brought from other cities. Several fistic encounters occurred during the day, and more trouble is expected. Hamburg's rtoclc Strike. HAMBURG. Gbbkaht, Dec. 7.—Nu merous meetings of the striking dock laborers were held in this city to-day. The largest of these v;as a mass- meeting at which Herr Holkenburr, Socialist member of the Reichstag for Hamburg, announced that the subscriptions to the fund for the support of the strikers had so increased that the distributors of the fund would be enabled to raise the weekly grants to unmarried men by one mark a week and to give to unmarried men an additional allowance according to the number of children in their families. The employers have held another meet ing at which their refusal to submit the dispute between the striking dockmen and themselves to an arbitration tribunal was reaffirmed. The action of the em ployers is due to the fact that a guarantee amounting to $250,000, has been signed for the protection and relief of the smaller employers. «. •' ■ r- ■■■ •• ■ . ■ . ■ TTJt*re Tl'eyJer I* Encamped. HAVANA, Cuba, Dec. 7.— A correspond ent at San Cristobal reports that General Weyler was encamped on December 5 at Arroyo Grande. It is yet unknown whether or not he has had an encounter with the rebels. The official dispatches from other parts of the island are devoid of interest. The recent attack on Guanabocoa has caused the military authorities to com mence the construction of fortifications there. Re-enfo;cements to the uumber of 1400 arrived to-day from Spain. The ltusaell Libel Case. LONDON, E.ng.. Dec. 7.— The trial of Lady Scott, John Cockerton, Fred Kast and William Aylott, charged with crim inal libel against Earl Russell, has been further adjourned until January 4, owing to the continued illness of Kast. In tbe meantime Cockerton and Aylott have been admitted to bail, Lady Scott being already at liberty under bonds. m After Gold Mines in Canada TOIiONTO. Oxx., Dec. 7.— Barney Bar nato and the Kothschilds, it is said, have agents looking over some gold mining properties in Canada.

Bell was today tendered the chairman snip ot tbe Inaugural Committee by Hauna and accepted. THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1896. POINTED COMMENT ON THE MESSAGE Declared to Be Colorless and Lacking in Bold Treatment Cleveland No Longer Assumes to Advise Congress or Act as a Dictator. Some California Statesmen Declare That the President's Effusion Is Void of Surprises. 

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 7.— When Congress convened to-day at noon the Pacific Coast was well represented. Sen ators Perkins, Stewart, Jones, Mitchell and Wilson of Washington were in their Beats. Senator Mcßride of Oregon is con fined to his bed by sickness. Senator White is yet at Los Angeles and his colleagues are anxiously awaiting his arrival, for it is feared the Pacific roads refunding bill will be brought up in the Senate before he can reach here. In the House of Representatives the fol lowing California members were in their seats: Maguire, Johnson, Barham, Hil born and Loud. McLachlan will arrive Wednesday. Dowers will be detained at San Diego for a week or ten days. On Mr. Loud's desk was a beautiful floral design, the gift of postal clerks, who appreciate the service Mr. Loud has en deavored to render them in his capacity as chairman of the Committee on Postof fices and Postroads. In both the Senate and House the Presi dent's message received but perfunctory attention. This is always tbe case. Most of the statesmen prefer to read the mes sage in the evening papers. Mr. Cleveland's reference to the Gor man-Wilson act was amusing to those [ members of the House who remember the famous "perfidy" letter which the Presi dent wrote to Chairman Wilson and which met gentleman read in the open House after the passage of the bill. Mr. Cleveland rejects the idea that more revenue is needed and falls back on his former proposition to issue long-term low rate bonds with which to retire the green backs or the repeal of the law which now compels the Secretary of the Treasury to reissue the greenbacks. It is fair to as sume that Secretary Carlisle will elaborate both these propositions in his report to Congress. However, as the Republican party will pay no attention to either sug gestion, but will proceed (as socn as it assumes power) to provide the treasury j with sufficient revenue, these discussions are superfluous. Mr. Cleveland's reference to his latest order affecting the extension of the civil service system to the consular service must be read with caution. While under his order the consular service is now under civil service rules it must be remembered tbat this has been done upon his execu tive order and not by the authority of the Civil Service Commission, though of course that body was in entire accord with the step. While, therefore, the incoming Secre tary of State may, if he wishes, follow the policy inaugurated by Secretary Olney, he is not legally bound to do so. £Nt the sweeping order of May 6, to which the President points with pride and by which he placed within the classified service every office in the executive departments, cannot be rescinded except by an act of Congress, ani it is a fact that no order extending the civil service in the depart ments has ever been rescinded by act of Congress. Mr. Cleveland's reference to the ineffi ciency of the anti-trust laws will receive a practical illustration during the next few ruon ths, for it is announced that Attorney- General Harmon proposes, during the J short span of official life still left to him, i to make another attempt to proceed against cue or more of tbe most offensive of these combinations. Senator Perkins, when asked to-night what he thought of the message, said that although portions of it were disappointing, on the whole he considered it a conserva tive and wise state paper, such as might be expected of Mr. Cleveland. He said, however, that his references to the Cuban affair and other matters indi cated rather a new departure on tbe part of the President, for while Mr. Cleveland had heretofore been very obstinate in as serting his own views, and seemed to ar rogate to himself all matters of foreign and domestic policy, he departed from this course in the message delivered to-day and seemed content to give Congress all the information he had at hand and made but few recommendations. He construed Cleveland's reference to the Pacific Coast roads as meaning that while the Executive had refrained from interfering with these railroads as here tofore, because propositions for their set tlement were pending in Congress, he gave notice in the message that unless the matter was settled by January 1 ihe Ex ecutive, through tbe Department of Jus tice, would take "the steps required by law. Senator Perkins said: ''Of course it would be superfluous for me to tell The Call readers where I stand on the ques tion of the Pacific roads debts. I have iterated and reiterated my views on this question. The President said said nothing about Hawaii. Tim was dis appointing, but I will say to you that I do not favor annexation under conditions now existing on the island. Our treaty of j tariff reciprocity has been one-sided. Hawaii has derived vastly more benefit than we have. "I cannot help but bslieve that the President was right in advising the Repub licans to frame a conservative lariff in or der to hold the sound-money Democrats. I believe in a moderate tariff bill— one suffi cient for revenue only. Yet I roust insist that our California fruits, almonds, wal nuts, quicksilver and other products of our State be amply protected. I believe in putting a special duty of \% cents per pound on sugar in place of the ad valorem duty of 40 per cent. The manufßCture of beet sugar in California promises to be a great industry, and must be amply pro tected." Judge Magnire said: "The President's message is, I think, generally unsatisfac tory because of its inconclusiveness. On the Cuban question it is non-committal, stating the facts as contended for by both parties, but failing to state tbe facts as he has found them upon investigation. He makes propositions for future actions based upon possible future developments. Cn the ;■ question of J { migration '■% he gives certain statistics "{ apparently com piled from 1 the published report ;of the Commissioner of ■ Immigration, his only - conclusion being that 'the apprehension heretofore existing to some extent of a large immigration from Japan to the United States is without any sub stantial foundation.' His discussion of the army and navy is commonplace. He bewails the alienation of the public lands indiscriminately to ; settlers) and monop olists, ; suggesting no remedy for existing monopoly, but in a helpless sort of way urging that the remainder of our public lands (by far the least valuable portion) 'should be more carefully dealt with and their alienation guarded by , better economy, and greater prudence.' : "On the question of the \ Pacific rail roads, after calling attention to the exist ing condition of the debt and the various j Dills introduced in Congress, but not passed/having in view a readjustment of the debts, he plainly teils Congress that unless some such bill is passed before the Ist of January next he will be J obliged [to enfore the provisions of , existing law. Why he should concern himself about bills in Congress and not passed I do not know, and he does explain why he is not so much concerned about the necessity of foreclosing the Pacific road mortgages. "His suggestions on the tariff question, if addressed to a tariff for revenue Con gress might be deserving ,of ■ some con sideration, but being addressed to the present Congress under existing circum stances are simply ludicrous. On the money question, his only suggestion for the relief of conditions caused by a scarcity of money is the retirement 'of some four hundred million dollars of the paper money of the United States by issuing interest bearing long-term j bonds for them. ' "The differences between the money he proposes to retire, and the bonds which he proposes to issue for them" are: First, that the bonds will bear interest while the paper money does not; that "the paper is taxable, -while the bonds will not be tax able, and that the paper circulate a3 money while . the bonds will not. His financial propositions have heretofore been rejected by a Democratic as well as a Republican Congress, and are likely to meet with the same fate this time. His message shows that all men who favor tariff reform are not necessarily statesmen." Judge Barham said: "I 1 think the President's message is a surprise from the fact that it contains no surprises." Upon the Cuban question the message is, in my judgment, what it ought to be. There seems to be no sufficient evidence to war rant the belief that there is anything but a kind of guerrilla warfare in Cuba. • I have never reached a fever heat over the independence of Cuba and doubt the capacity of those people to govern them selves, and it is highly probable that some kingly power, firmly and honestly exer cised, is the better form of government there. "I see no reason why the United States should endanger war with a great nation by undertaking to become -general guar dian over such people. A point might be reached beyond which civilization will permit no nation to go, but it is hardly proper to presume so great a' nation :as Spain will j:o to that extreme. At all events, let us have evidence of the fact and not presume. Of course i do not agree with the President upon his ideas of tariff legislation. I think there should be an extra session of Congress and a protective tariff measure passed. • ,' ?■ - I "The election of 1894, as well as the last one, evidences the will of the people upon this subject. When this is gone the ques tion of silver should be submitted for in ternational agreement. . 1 am - much inclined to the opinion that the financial question needs little or no Congressional legislation. Agitution is not what is needed. What we want is business con fidence—the result will be prosperity." ■> • Representative Loud said the President's allusions to Cuba were dignified and suf ficiently aggressive. He thought. a fur ther loss of life and property in ' Cuba might be prevented in some honorable way without our intervention. '; "We ■ had better get our own Govern ment on an even keel before we meddle with other nations' affairs,", said Mr. Loud, who also expressed himself opposed to Hawaiian annexation. Mr. Loud was well pleased with the President's refer ence to the postal bill of which the Cali fornian is the author. The President in corporated in his message: parts- of Mr. Loud's committee report on this subject. Judge Hiliorn said that the message was admirable and quite like Mr. Cleve land's usual literary effusions, but there was a very >• marked departure from the tone of former messages, for the President does not now assume to even advise Con gress, much less to arrogate to himself the role of dictator. -A 4- W. )'£-.' ' ■ Mr. Hilborn . said that the message was colorless and. lacked the bold treatment which has' heretofore characterized Pres dent Cleveland's messages, He attributed Mr. Cleveland's conservatism to his de sire not to embarrass the incoming ad ministration. . Mr. liilborn was well pleased with that part of the message which treated of naval affairs and coast fortifications. • Hilborn will soon intro duce a bill to establish at Benicia, Cal., a repair station for gun carriages. This will be a start, he believes, in the direction of establishing at this point a factory lor the assembling heavy ordnance for the army and; navy. Mr. Hilborn will also try to secure appropriations for enlargements of shops at the Mare Island yard and for tools. ' Senator Dubois said to The Call corre spondent to-night that the , President in his annual message to Congress advanced his usual radical views on the currency and advocated the retire of g*een- Dacks by the issuance of bond*. In effect his advice was that the Government go out of the banking business and leave the issuance '.of currency to the national banki.  '•■;•. vjiCixU. Senator Dubois expressed the opinion that neither this • Congress , nor the next would attempt to contract the currency or give ; such power to the national banks.

DISCUSSED AT CANTON. Major McKinley Reads the Message With Interest. CANTON, Ohio, Dec. 7.— The burden ol Hit talk in Canton and at the home of the President-elect to-day was about President Cleveland's message to Congress. The people about the town discussed it. The visitors discussed it, and some of tbe Congressmen who wera here to-day mildly criticized certain parts of it. Major McKinley read it from copy fur nished him by one of the telegraph com panies an hour or so before Congress as sembled. The opening sentence with its strong implied approval of the results of the recent election seemed full of pleasant interest for the President-elect, though he made no verbal comment upon any por tion of the document. He read aloud parts of it to a group of friends, and they commented occasionally on some of the writer's observations. Major McKinley turned to the portion of the message devoted to the consider ation of Cuban affairs with the keenest interest and read it aloud in clear, in cisive and firmest tones. A Congressman who was near by said: "President Cleve land's exposition *cf the Cuban problem and his statement o( the existing con ditions is just, graphic and conservative, but it is much less sympathetic with the insurgents than most people hoped for. I do not think bis idea about home rule for Cuba wiil come to anything practical, for the Cubans will not trust the Spanish .Government and would put no faith in their fairest promises. It looks to me as though we would have to recognize the insurgents as belligerents within ninety days." 

"DIGNIFIED LANGUAGE." Attitude of the President Toward Turkey Pleases English Papers. LONDON, Eno., Dec. 7.— Commenting upon Cleveland's message, the Standard says: "It is dignified^and able and is marked throughout with sterling common sense. It deserves and will doubtless obtain the serious steely of the European powers." The Stan dard is of the opinion that the message will excite bitterness in Spain, who, never theless, must make up her mind to listen to friendly counsel. Spaniards may be excused if they detect a tone of menace. The condition of Cuba will certainly not induce impartial observers to say that menace is unwarranted. The paper dwells on Mr. Cleveland's pointed reassertion of the Monroe doc trine in the paragraph reading: "What ever circumstances may arise our policy and our interests would constrain us to object to the acquisition of the island or any interference with its control by aDy other power." It sees in this the intention of the United States to claim a virtual protec torate over the continent and the islands thereof. This, it adds, is a large and bold policy, that is not quite free from danger, as Spain is not the only power with which the United States might thereby become embroiled. The paper expresses the opinion tbat if Spain found a powerful foreign friend in Europe to help prevent Cuba from pass ing from her hands, the objections of the United States, bated on the Monroe doctrine, would not be of much account. Fortunately there seems to be no real risk that the Monroe doctrine will occa sion further disputes with Great Britain. la conclusion the Standard refers to the passages referring to tbe satisfactory end ing of the Venezuelan dispute, and says that the dignified language of the message where it refers to Turkey shows the powers tbat they can be assured of the cordial support of the United States in executing corrective measures in that country. The Daily News is chiefly impressed by the section of the message referring to Cuba. It admits that the Americans can not be permanently indifferent to the dis astrous war. but says that while the in tentions of President Cleveland and Secre tary of State Olney may be evor so good, European opinion is not favorable to the latest version of the Monroe doctrine, and Spain will bave some influential support if she holds out for it. The Chronicle will say in a leader on tbe same subject that the alternative be fore Spain is really to either satisfy the Cubans or ha\e Cuba taken from her for cibly. In conclusion the paper says: We advise Spain in her own interest to sell Cuba quickly, but he wonld be no friend of the United States who would advise the latter to buy the island." NEW 

YORK VIEWS. Attention Given to the President's Reference to the Cuban Situation. NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 7.—Comment ing upon Cleveland's message, the prin cipal metropolitan dailies will to-morrow say: The Sun: "The Cuban chapter is ably written in a style differing conspicuously from thatof the opening and cioaing para graphs of the message. Its statements and suggestions hold the attention closely until you come to the disheartening con clusion. '•In well-balanced periods sympathy for the struggling patriots and friendship and admiration for Spain are equally dispensed. "With the happy consciousness of having unloaded everything this wonderful states man winds up his last message to Con gress with a beautiful tribute to himself: 'Wnen our differences are foreotten and our contests of political opinion are no longer remembered, nothing in the retro spect of our public service wiil be as for tunate and comforting as the recollection of official duty well performed and the memory of a constant devotion to the in terests of our confiding fellow-country men.' "His confiding fellow-countrymen will not doubt that the final paragraph at least is Mr. Clevpland's own. Only two men who ever lived could have written it, and Mr. Pecksniff is dead." The Times: "Mr. Cleveland made a singularly clear statement of the political situation and of the course of events that has produced it." The Tribune: "It is now more than twelve years since Cleveland, by his nomi nation against Blame, became the un questioned leader ol a great National party. "To him it is largely due that a disas trous change in the tariff has been effected, and but for him the effort of that party to deba*e the National currency and tarnish the National honor might have prevailed." The Herald: "President Cleveland notes that affairs in Cuba are worse than they were a year ago; that Spain has not succeeded in estab lishing her authority, and that the putative Cuban Government exists only on paper and that both sides are now engaged in a wholesale annihilation of property, under which the industrial value of the island must soon be wiped out." The Journal: "The space which Presi dent Cleveland ,devotes to the recipro cal interests of Cuba, Spain and tbe United States in his last an nual message to Congress indicates that he is not wholly insensible to the agitation of the question which has long progressed in this country. But his con clusions show beyond a doubt that he will leave to his successor the honor of taking the first step to assure Cuban liberty." The Keef-lrust Investigation.
