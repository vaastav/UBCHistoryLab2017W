Disloyalty Among Cer tain Elements In Our Na tional Life Serious Menace to Peace Washington Dec 7 President Wll on today delivered the following mes age to congress Gentlemen of the Congress Since I last had the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union the war of nations on the other side of the sea which had then only begun to dlscloso Its portentous proportions has extend ed Its threatening and sinister scopo until It has swept within Its flamo tomo portion of overy quarter of tuo jtlobe not excepting our own hemi sphere has altered Uie whole face of International affairs and now presents prospect of reorganization and re construction such an statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before We have stood apurt studiously neu tral It was our manifest duty to do so Not only did we have no part or interest In the policies which seem to have brought the conflict on It was necessary If a universal catastropho was to be avoided that a limit should tie set to the sweep of destructive war find that some part of the great family of nations should keep the processes of peaco nllvo If only to prevent col lectlvu economic rulu and the break down throughout the world of tho in dustries by which lis populations are fed and suhtalned It was manifestly the duty of the self governed nations of this hemisphere to redress If pos sible the balance of economic loss And confusion In the other If they could do nothing more In the day of readjustment and recuperation we earnestly hope and believe that they can be or Infinite service American Nations Partners In this neutrality to which they -were bidden not only by their sepaiate life- und their habitual detachment from tho politics of Europe but also by it clear perception of International duty the states or Amorlca have conscious of a now and moro vital community Interest and moral partnership In affairs moro clearly conscious of the many common sym pathies and Interests and duties which told them stand together There was a time In the early days Of our own great nation and of the re publics fighting their way to Inde pendence In Centra and South Amer ica when the government of tho Unit ed States looked upon Itself as In some ort the guardian or the republics to the south of her as against any en croachments or efforts at political con irol from the other side of the water -felt it Its duty to play the part oven -without Invitation from them and I -think that we can claim that tho task -was undertaken with a true and dis interested enthusiasm for tho freedom ot the Amorlcas and tho unmolested self government ot her Independent peoples But It was always difficult to jnalntaln such f role without offense to tho pride of the peoples whoso free dom of action we sought to protect jmd without piovoking serious miscon ceptions of our motives and every thoughtful man of affairs must wol come tho altered circumstances of the new day In whoso light wo now stand when there Is no claim of guardian ship or thought of wards but instead u full and honorable association as of iartners between ourselves and our neighbors in tho Interest of all Amer ica north and south Our concern for the Independence and prosperity of tho states of Central and South America Is not altered We retain unabated tho spirit that has inspired us through out the wholo life of our government And which was so frankly put Into words by President Monroe We still mean always to make a common cause of national Independence and of po litical liberty In America Attitude Toward Mexico We have been put to the test in itbe case of Mexico and we have stood the test Whether we have benefited Jdexico by the course wo have pursued -remains to be seen Her fortunes are her own bands But we have at least proved that we will not take ad vantage of her In her distress and un dertake to Impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing We will aid and befriend Mexico but wo will not coerce her and our course with regard to her ought to be suffi cient proof to all America that we -seek no political suzerainty or selfish -control The moral Is that the states of America aro not hostile rivals but co operating friends and that their grow ring sense of community of interest alike in matters political and in mat ters economic is likely to give them a new significance as factors in Inter national affairs and in the political history of the world Drawing the Americas Together There is I venture to point out an especial significance just now attach ing to this whole matter of drawing the Americas together in bonds of hon orable partnership and mutual advan tage because of tho iconotnlo readjust ments which the world must Inevi tably witness within the next genera tion when peace shall have at last re sumed its healthful tasks In the per formance of these tsks 1 beliqve the Americas to be destined to play their parts together I an Interested to fix your attention on this prospect now because unless you take it within your view and permit the full significance ttiit wsnd rar tfcought I can jU ffef ft ff gfct Rgfet fa w to set forth he particular matter that lies at the vory front of my whole thought ju I address you today I mean na tional defense - No one who really comprehends tne spirit 6f the great people for whom we are appointed to speak can fall to perceive that their passion Is for peace their genius best displayed In the practice of tho arts of peace Great democracies are not belligerent They do not seek or desire war Their thought Is ot Individual liberty and ot tho free labor that supp6rts life and tho uncenrored thought that quickens It Conquest and dominion are not in our reckoning or agreeable to our principles But Just because we do mand unmolested development and the undisturbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty wo resent from whatever quarter It may come the ag gression we ourselves will not prac tice We insist upon security In prose cuting our self chosen lines ot nation al development We do more than that Wo demand It also for others Question of Preparedness Out of such thoughts grow all our policies We regard war merely as a means of asserting tho rights of a peo ple against aggression And we are as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dic tatorial power within our own nation as ot aggression from without We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses whl t are as necessary In times of peaco as In times of war and wo shall always see to It that our military peace establishment Is no larger than is actually and continu ously needed for tho uses of days in which no enemies move against us But wo do believe In a body of froe citizens ready and sufficient to take caro of themselves and of the govern ments which they have set up to serve them But war has uover been a mere mat tor of men and guns It Is a thing of disciplined might If our cltlcno are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons they must know how mod ern lighting Is done und what to do when the summons comes to render themselves Immediately available and Immediately effective And the gov ernment must be their servant In this mutter must supply them with the training they need to take care of themselves and of It It Is with these Ideals In mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate nntlonnl defense were conceived which will be laid be fore you and which I urgo you to sanction and put Into effect as soon as thoy can be properly scrutinized and discussed Thoy seem to me the essential first steps and they seem to me for the present sufllclent Larger Army Plan They contemplate an Increase of tho standing force of the regular army from Its present strength of 5023 ofllcers and 102985 enllBtcd men of all services to a strength of 7136 officers and 134707 enlisted men or 141843 all told all services rank and file by the addition of fifty two companies of coast artillery fifteen companies of engi neers ten regiments of lnfnntry four regiments of field artillery and four aero squadrons besides 750 ofllcers required for a great variety of extra service especially the all Important duty of training the citizen force ot which I shall presently speak 792 noncommissioned ofllcers for serv ice In drill recruiting and tho like and the necessary quota of en listed men for the quartermaster corps tho hospital corps tho ord nance department and other similar auxiliary services Theso are tho ad ditions necessary to render tho army adequate for its present duties duties which It has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and bor ders and at our Interior army posts but also In tho Philippines In the Hawaiian islands nt tho Isthmus and In Porto Rico By way of making the country ready to assert some part of Its real power promptly and upon a larger scale should occasion arise the plan also contemplates supplementing the army by a force of 400000 disciplined citi zens raised In Increments of 133 000 a year throughout a period of three years This it is proposed to do by a process of enlistment un der which tho serviceable men of the country would bo asked to bind them selves to serve with the colors for pur pose of training for short periods throughout three years and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional furlough period of three years This forco of 100000 men v6uld bo provided with personal accoutrements us fast as enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready to be sup plied nt any time They would be assembled tor training at stated in tervals at convenient places In asso ciation with suitable units or the regular army Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months in the year At least so much by tho way of preparation for defense seems to me to be absolutely Imperative now We cannot do less The Naval Program The program which will be laid be loro you by the secretary of the navy Is similarly conceived It involves only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall be carried out but it does make definite and explicit a program which has heretofore been only Implicit held in the minds of the two -committees on naval affairs and disclosed in the de bates of the two houses but nowhere formulated or rormally adopted It seems to me very clear that it will be to the advantage or the country for the roiigress to adopt a comprehen sive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and effi ciency and to press that plan to com pletion within the next five years We have always looked to the navy of the country as our first and chief line of defense we have always seen it to bo our manifest course of pru dence to be strong on the seas Year by year we have been creating a navy which now ranks very high Indeed among the navies of the maritime na tions We should now definitely de termine how we shall complete what we havo begun and how toon The program to he laid before you contemplates the construction within five years of ten battleships six bat tle cruisers ten scout cruisers fifty destroyers fifteen fleet submarines eighty five coast submarines four gun boats one hosDltal sblp two Wz i mL piyr5 

STRIKING POINTS IN PRESIDENT WILSONS MESSAGE The department of war contemplates an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from Its present strength of 5023 officers and 102985 enlisted men to 7136 officers and 134707 enlisted men and supplementing the army by a force of 400000 disciplined citizens It will be t the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency The1 gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders It Is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and development that we should have a great merchant marine It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that In what we are now to undertake we should pay as we go We should be following an almost universal example of modern gov ernment If we were to draw the greater part or even the wholo of the revenues we need from the Income taxes We have been put to the test In the case of Mexico and we have stood the test Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued remains to be seen Our concern for the Independence and prosperity of the states of Central and South America Is not altered tion ships two fuel oil snips ana ono regular repair ship It Ib proposed that of this number we shall tho first year provide

ammunition ship and ono repair ship More Men for the Navy The secretary of the navy Is asking also for the Immediate addition to the personnel of tho navy of 7500 sail ors 1200 apprentice seamen and 1500 marines This Increase would he sufllclent to caro for tho ships which nro to be completed with in the fiscal year 1917 and also for tho number of men which muBt bo put In training to man tho ships which will be completed early In 1918 It Is also necessary that the number of midship men at tho Naval academy at Annap olis should be Increased by at least three hundred If tills full program should bo car ried out wo should havo built or build ing in 1921 according to tho estimates of survival and standards of classifi cation followed by the general boaid of the department an effective navy consisting of 27 battleships of the first line G battlo cruisers 25 battleships of tho second line 10 armored cruis ers 13 scout cruisers 5 first class cruisers 3 second class cruisers 10 third class cruisers 108 destroyers 18 fleet submarines 157 coast submarines C monitors 20 gunboats 4 supply ships 15 fuel ships 4 transports 3 tenders to torpedo vessels 8 ves sels of special types and 2 ammuni tion ships This would be a navy fit ted to our needs and worthy of our traditions But armies and instruments ot war are only part of what has to be con sidered If wo aro to consider tho su preme matter of national and security In all Its aspects There aro other great matters which will be thrust upon our attention whether wo will or not There Is for example a very pressing question of trade and shipping involved In this great problem of national adequacy It Is necessary for many weighty rea sons of national efficiency and devel opment that we should have a great merchant marine It is high time we repalrod our mis take and resumed our commercial Inde pendence on the seas Need of Merchant Marine For It Is a question ot independ ence If other natlonB go to war or seek to hamper each others com merce our merchants It seems aro at their mercy to do with as they please We must use their ships and use them as they determine We havo not ships enough of our own Wo cannot handle our own commerce on the seas Our Independence is provin cial and is only on land and within our own borders We aro not likely to be permitted to use oven the ships of other nations in rivalry of their own trade and are without means to extend our commerce even where the doors are wide open and our goods desirod Such a situation is not to be endured It is of capital import ance not only that tho Unfted States should he its own carrier on the seas and enjoy tho economic independence which only an adequate merchant ma rine would give it but also that the American hemisphere as a whole should enjoy a like independence and self sufficiency If it is not to bo drawn into the tangle ot European affairs Without Buch Independence the whole question of our political unity and self determination is very seriously clouded and complicated indeed Moreover we can develop no true or effective American policy without ships of our own not ships of war but ships of peace carrying goods and carrying vaurf more creating friend ships and rendering indispensable services to all Interests on this side the water Must Provide Ships With a view to meeting those pressing necessities of our commerce and availing ourselves at the earliest possible moment of the present un paralleled opportunity of linking the two Americas together in bonds ot mat neca was tnen lorcsoen it is now acutely felt and everywhere real ized by those for whom trade Is wait ing but who can And no conveyance for their goods I am not so much In terested In tho particulars of tho pro gram as I am In taking lmmedlato ad vantage of the groat opportunity which awaits us If wo will but act in thlB emergency The plans tor the armed forces of the nation which I havo outlined and for the general policy ot adequate preparation for mobilization and do fonse Involve of courso vory largo ad ditional expenditures of money ex penditures which will considerably ex ceed tho estimated revenues of tho government It is made my duty by law whonover the estimates of ex penditure exceed the estimates of revenue to call tho nttontlon of tho congress to the fact and suggest any means of meeting tho deficiency that it may be wise or posslblo for mo to suggest I am ready to boliovo that it would be my duty to do so In any case and I feel particularly bound to speak of tho matter when It appears that tho deficiency will arise directly out of tho adoption by the congress of meas ures which I myself urge it to adopt Allow me therefore to speak briefly of tho present stato ot tho treasury and of tho fiscal problems which the next year will probably dlscloso State of the Finances On tho thirtieth of Juno last thero was an available balance in tho gon eral fund of tho treasury of 104170 10578 The total estimated rccoipts for the year 191G on tho assumption that the emergency revenue measure passed by tho last congress will not be extended beyond Its present limit the thirty first ot December 1915 and that the present duty of one cent per pound on sugar will be discontinued after tho first of May 1916 will bo 670365500 The balance of Juno last and these estimated revenues come therefore to a grand total of 774 43660578 The total estimated dis bursements for tho present fiscal year including 25000000 for the Panama canal 12000000 for probable de ficiency appropriations and 50 000 for miscellaneous debt redemp tions will bo 753891000 and tho balance In the general fund of tho treasury will bo reduced to 20644 60578 Tho emorgency revenue act if continued beyond its present tlmo lim itation would produce during the half year then remaining about 41000 000 Tho duty of one cent per pound on sugar If continued would produce during tho two months of tho fiscal year remaining after the first of May about 15000000 These two sums amounting togethor to 56000000 If added to the revenues of the second half of the fiscal year would yield the treasury at the end of the year an available balance of 7664460678 k The additional revenues required to carry out the program of military and naval preparation of which I havo spoken would as nt present estimated be for the fiscal year 1917 93800000 Thoso figures taken with tho figures for the present fiscal year which I havo already given dlscloso our finan cial problem for tho year 1917 As suming that the taxes imposed by tho emergency revenue act and tho pres ent duty on sugar aro to be discontin ued and that the balance at tho close of the present fiscal year will bo only 2064460578 that the disbursements for the Panama canal will again be about twenty five millions and that the additional expenditures for the army and navy are authorized by the congress the deficit in the general fund of the treasury on the thirtieth of June 1917 will bo nearly two hun dred and thirty five millions To this sum at least fifty millions should be added to represent a safe working bal ance for the treasury and twelve mil lions to include the usual deficiency estimates in 1917 and these additions would make a total deficit of some two hundred and ninety seven millions If the present taxes should be continued throughout this year and the next however there would be a balance In the treasury of some seventy six and a half millions at the end of the pres ent fiscal year and a deficit at the end of the next year of only some fifty millions or reckoning In sixty two millions for deficiency appropriations and a safe treasury belance at the end of the year a total deficit of some one hundred and twelve millions The obvious moral of the figures Is that It is a plain counsel ot prudence to con tinue all ot the preesnt taxes or their equivalents and confine ourselves to the problem of providing 112000000 of new revenue rather than 297000 000 fyew Sources of Revenue How shall we obtain the new reve nue It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that in what we aro now I tual Interest and service an hope to undertake wo should pay as tunlty which may never return again If wo miss it now proposals will bo made to the present congress for the purchase or construction of shlpB to be owned and directed by the govern ment similar to those made to the last congress but modified In some essen tial particulars I recommend these proposals to you for your prompt ac ceptance with the more confidence because every month that has elapsed since the former proposals were made has made the necessity for such action more and more manifestlylmperatlve wo go The people of the country are entitled to know Just what burdens of taxation they are to carry and to know from the outset now The new bills should be paid by internal taxation To what sources then shall we turn This is so peculiarly a question which the gentlemen ot the house of representatives are expected under the Constitution to propose nn answer to that you will hardly expect me to do more than discuss it In very gen eral terms We should be following ru almost universal example ot mod ern govcrnmant n we j rtr the greater part or oven tho whole of the revenue wo need from tho In come taxes By somewhat lowering the present limits of exemption and tho figure at which the surtax shall begin to be Imposed and by Increasing step by step throughout the present gradu ation tho surtax itself the income taxes as at present apportioned would yield sums sufficient to balance the books of the treasury at tho end ot the fiscal year 1917 without any where making the burden unreason ably or oppressively heavy Tho pre cise reckonings aro fully and accurate ly set out In tho report of the secre tary of the treasury which will be Im mediately laid before you And there are many additional sources of revenue which can Justly bo resorted to without hampering tho In dustries of tho country or putting any too great charge upon individual ex penditure A ono per cent tax per gallon on gasollno and naptha would yield at tho present estimated pro duction 10000000 a tax ot 50 cents per horse power on automobiles and Internal explosion engines 15000 000 a stamp tax on bank checks probably 18000000 a tax of 25 cents per ton on pig Iron 10000000 a tax ot 60 cents per ton on fabricated Iron and steel probably 10000000 In a country of great industries like this it ought to bo easy to distribute the bur dens of taxation without making them anywhere bear too heavily or too ex clusively upon any one set ot persons or undertakings What Is ckar is that the industry of this generation should pay the bills of this generation I have spoken to you today gentle men upon a slnglo theme the thor ough preparation of the nation to care for its own security and to make suro of enttro freedom to play tho Impartial role In this hemisphere and In tho world which wo all believe to havo been providentially assigned to It I have had In my mind no thought of any lmmedlato or particular danger arising out of our relations with other nations We aro at peaco with all tho nations of the world and there is reason to hope that no question In controversy between this and other governments will lead to any serious breach of amicablo relations gravo as soma differences of attltudo and policy havo been and may yet turn out to bo I am sprry to say that the gravest threats against our national peaco and safety havo been uttered within our own borders Thero are citizens of tho United States I blush to admit born under other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and oppor tunity of Amorlca who have poured tho poison of disloyalty Into the very artorios of our national lfc who havo sought to bring tho authority and good namo of our government into contempt to destroy our Industries wherover thoy thought it effective for their vindictive purposes to strlko at them and to debase our politics to tho uses of foreign intrigue Their number Is not great as compared with the wholo number of thoso sturdy hosts by which our nation has been enriched In recent generations out of virile foreign stocks but it is great enough to have brought deep disgrace upon us and to havo made It neces sary that we should promptly make use of processes of law by which wo may be purged of their corrupt dis tempers America never witnessed anything like this before It nover dreamed it possible that men sworn Into Its own citizenship men drawn out of great free stocks such as sup plied some of tho best and strongest olements of that Ilttlo hut how heroic nation that In a high day of old staked Its very life to free Itself from every entanglement that had darkened the fortunes of tho older nations and set up a now standard here that men ot such origliiB and such free choices ot allegiance would over turn In malign reaction against tho govern ment and people who had welcomed and nurtured them and seek to mako this proud country once more a hot bed or European passion A little while ago such a thing would havo seemed Incredible Because It was Incredible wo mado no preparation for It We would have been almost ashamed to prepare for It as if wo wcro suspicious of ourselves our own comrades and neighbors But the ugly and Incredible thing has actual ly come about and we are without adequate federal laws to deal with It I urgo you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and teol that In doing so I am urging you to do nothing less than save the honor and self respect of the nation Such crea tures of passion disloyalty and an archy must be crushed out They aro not many but thoy are infinitely malignant and the hand of our power should close over them at once They have formed plots to destroy property they have entered into conspiracies against the neutrality ot the govern ment they have sought to pry Into every confidential transaction of the government In order to serve Interests alien to our own It Is possible to deal with these things very effectually I need not suggest the terms in which they may be dealt with Are Disgrace to the Nation I wish that it could be said that only a few men misled by mistaken sentiments of allegiance to the govern ments under which they were born had been guilty of disturbing the self possession and misrepresenting tho temper and principles of tho country during these days ot terrible war when it would seem that every man who was truly an American would instinctively make It bis duty and his pride to keep the scales ot Judgment even and prove himself a partisan ot no nation but his own But it cannot There are some men among us and many resident abroad who though born and bred injrhe United States and calling themselves Americans have so forgotten themselves and their honor as citizens as to put their passionate sympathy with one or the other side in the great European con flict above their regard tor tho peace and dignity of the United States They also preach and practice disloyalty No laws I suppose can reach cor ruptions of tho mind and heart hut I should not speak of others without also speaking of these and expressing the oven deeper humiliation and scorn which every self paBsessed and thouchtfullv natrioflc American must reel when He tninss ot them and ol the discredit they uro daily bringing upon us hlle we speak of the preparation of the nation to make sure of her security and her effective power wo must not fall Into the patent error of supposing that her real strength comos from armaments and mero safe guards of written law What Is more Important is that tho Industries and resources of tho coun try should be available nnd ready for mobilization Tho transportation problem is an exceedingly serious and pressing ono In this country There has from tlmo to time of late been reason to fear that our railroads would not much longer be able to cope with It successfully as at prosent equipped and co ordained I suggest that It would bo wise to provide for a com mission of inquiry to ascertain by a thorough canvass of the wholo ques tion whether our laws as at present framed and administered are as serv iceable as they might be in the solu tion of the problem It is obviously a problem that lies at the very founda tion of our efficiency as a people Such an Inquiry ought to draw out every circumstance and opinion worth con sidering and we need to know all sides of the matter If wo mean to do any thing In the field of federal legislation Regulation of Railroads No one I am sure would wish to tnko any backward step The regula tion of the railways of tho country by fcdoral commission has had admlrablo results and has fully Justified the hopes and expectations of thoso by whom tho policy of regulation was originally proposed Tho question is not what should we undo 7 It Is whether thero is anything else we can do that would supply us with offectlvo means In tho very process of regula tion for bettering the conditions un der which tho railroads are operated and for making them moro useful serv ants of tho country as a whole It seems to me that It might bo the part of wisdom therefore before further legislation in this field Is attempted to look at tho whole problem of co-ordination and efficiency in tho full light ot a fresh assessment of circumstance and opinion as a guide to dealing with tho soveral parts of It For what wo are seeking now what In my mind Is tho single thought of this message Ib national efficiency and security We sorvo a great nation We should servo It in tho spirit ot Its peculiar gcvMuc H Ib tho genius of common men for self government In dustry Justice liberty and peace We should seo to it that it lacks no instru ment no facility or vigor of law to mako It sufficient to play Its part
