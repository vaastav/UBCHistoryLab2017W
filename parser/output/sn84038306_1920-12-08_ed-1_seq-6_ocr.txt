WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1»20. NORMALCY. 4 .5^ President-elect Harding declared in his campaign speeches that he stood for normalcy. Nov what kind of a normalcy does our soon-to-be chief executive stand torl&it-ri'k Is "it the' normalcy' of 1912,"when prices were about one-half what they were when our last presidential cam paign, commenced. or is it the normalcy tit Mark* Hanna times when prices were not one-fourth what they' were six months ago? Until the country knows the kind of normalcy we are going to have, merchants will not care to buy ^any thing that they can possibly do with out and" business ^conditions will be qdlte the reverse of normal. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Yesterday President Wilson's an nual message was read in both houses of Congress. It wa^ replete with-in spiring thoughts and admirable rec ommendations. Here are a few of the first sentences of the message: When I addressed myself to per forming the duty laid upon the presi dent by the constitution to present to you an annual report on the state of the union, I found my thought dominated by an immortal sentence Of Abraham Lincoln's. "Let us have faith that right makes might, aAd in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it,"— a sentence immortal because it em bodies in a form of utter simplicity and purity the essential faith of the nation, the faith in which it was gn ceived and the faith in which it has grown to glory and power. With tta&t faith and the birth of a nation founded upon'it came the hope into the world that a ijew order would pre-' •fall throughout the^affalra of man kind, an order In which reason and right would take precedence of cove tousness and force, sgid jl believe that I express the wish and£sfRur pose of every thoughtful' American when say that this sentence marks lor us in the plainest mapner the part we should play alike in the arrange rs m'ent of our domestic affairs and In 'Yk our exercise of influence upon the af fairs of the world. By this faith, and fcy this faith alone, can the world be lifted out of its present confusion and ~,J despair.

WILSON UPHELD BY THE LEAGI (From the New York World) ^The case of the Republican Senators versus President Wilson has been de .• cided by the court of last resort in favor of the President. His. inter pretation of Article X. has been ac cepted at Geneva. The Lodgo-John son-Harding interpretation has been rejected. 5 I yv %t & 1 Article X. is, not a military alliance, aB the American opponents of the League have so stridently maintained. It does not enable "an alien Council" to send our troops into war, as Mr. Sarding has so foolishly said. It does not mean any or the things that the enemies of the covenant claim that it •Leans. The Issue has been definitely deter mined at Geneva by the sub-committee of the Commission of Five, which says In its report that— •t3 It cannot be toe emphatically stated that Article X. does not guarantee the territorial Integrity of any member of the League. All it does Is to condemn external aggression of the territorial integ- rlty and xoIitieaI independence of any member ol the League, and *vJ calls upon the Council to consider what can be done to resist such aggression. This interpretation is in harmony with the language of Article X. and with the construction'that the support ers of the League everywhere have given to it By way of further emphasizing construction the As sembly has accepted Denmark's ex planation that no Danish troops can be sent to help supervise the plebis cite at Vllna except by a vote of the Danish Parliament This again con firms everything that President Wil son has said in regard to the legal obligations incurred under Article X. 

FACTS ABOUT IRELAND: Under the above caption the Des Moines Register comments thought fully and at considerable length on present conditions In Ireland, and quotes liberally In support of its views from the London Times, a Tory newspaper that would not be likely to exaggerate the misdeeds of Eng land's Black and Tan army of In taatotti^.*- The Register's editorial is too 'f'0 lengthy for reproduction by us in its entirety. The following is the con cluding portion "The r«iason why it is so important to understand this matter here in the United States is hinted at in one statement by the Times: "We have from the beginning1 Insisted that the Irish problem Is essentially a British concern, bnt we have never been blind to the embarrassments which the activity of millions of Irishmen in the dominions, In the United States, and In other parts of the'world may, ff their hostility be aggravated, even tually entail for Great Britain". "What is here suggested may as well be plainly stated, in the baldest terms. This Irish situation goes to the very heart of the whole Bpheme to reunite the world, for the coming together of the, English' speaking peoples is made absolutely, impos sible so long as men of Irish blood, are stirred as they-are* today. As surely as this situation lasts *o sure ly will the British empire disinte grate, for sooner or later in every dominion Irish unrestjwlll get its opportunity. cjf "Coining back to the matter of the reprisals at Trallee, and to the gov ernment attempt to suppress the newspaper correspondent of the Daily News, let" us read in conclusion this appeal for. an open book from the Times. Speaking again editorially, the Times says: "Impartial inquiry has been flatly refused. Yet It Is essential that the facts should be known. The truth may- be unpalatable but nothing save knowledge of the truth can enable the English pub lic to form a just apd sure, judg ment upon British policy in Ire land. Therefore we hold it ino perative that the Independent press of this country should leave no room for misunderstand ing of the view it takes and must take of any attempt an the part of the fordes of the crown in Ire land to prevent newspaper cor respondents from doing- their duty." "The jnere fact that the government is'trying to suppress the news from Ireland ought to be enough lor any American." T. Embarrassing.
