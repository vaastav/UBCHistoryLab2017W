Explosion of a Candle Factory at San Francisco, Cal. A New Kailroad Company With Twenty Millions Capital. Interesting Testimony of Flipper in the Flipper Case. David Davis, President of the Senate, Manifests Indignation. Congressman Belford, of Colorado, Goes for President Arthur. At the Capital. Washington, December 7. The gen eral comment on the President's mes sage among Senators and Congressmen of all sections of political belief appear to be that it is a very able document. Opinieus as to the correctness of its con clusions vary of course, according to party affiliation and individual senti ment, but there is a general agreement that in clearness of style, dignity of tone, and force of argument it is far above the average level of the annual President's messages for a number of years, and that it indicates the posses sion, by its author, of a much higher grade of ability than has heretofore been attributed to him. There is some disappointment among the Paciiic coast representatives at the absence of any hearty recommendation for legislative action to restrict Chinese immigration especially as the President takes pains to suggest that Congress should care fully regard the interests and suscepti bilities of the Chinese government in legislating on that subject. On the oth er hand, it is noticed with gratification that the message does say that legisla tion is necessary to carry the treaties into effect and also that the President signiiicantly, though not so open as might be desired, refers to the evils of unrestricted Chinese immigration when he says that our government views with concern the efforts to seek replenish ment of the diminished population of the Sandwich Islands from outward sources. President Arthur's vigorous utteran ces upon the Mormon question give un alloyed satisfaction to the Pacific coast people and all other opponents of poly gamy, and will probably have a deci ded influence on the result of the pend ing contest in regard to the admission of Campbell as an anti-Mormon dele gate. It is considered highly probable that the Republican members of the House will solidly sustain Speaker Kei fer in the position taken by him to-day in favor ot Campbell, and these com bined influences will also.it is believed, be reinforced by many Democratic members whose abhorrence of Mor monism will lead them to forgo the pos sible advantage of embarrassing the Republican Speaker, which is appar ently the purpose of the opposition, led by ex-Speaker Randall, so that on the whole Campbell's admission seems to bo pretty well assured. Ihe announcement made by Senator Davis, of Illinois, of his position on the question of changing the officers of the Senate has definitely removed both of these questions from the field of con troversy during the present Congress, unless the status ot the Senate be changed by the death of more of its members from doubtful States. The candidacy of Gorham and Rid dleberger for the ollices of Secretary and Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate is ac cordingly relegated to the domain of dead issues. Senator Miller to-day introduced three bills, by request; one directs the officers of the Treasury to examine all unpaid accounts heretofore filed in the departments for services rendered and supplies furnished under the direction of the Indian Department and its agents and in cases where said services and supplies are found to have actually been applied to the benefit of the Indians to report to Congress the balance equita bly due on said account, notwithstand ing no sufficient appropriation existed to pay them. The second bill provides that fees allowed to registers and re ceivers for reducing testimony to writ ing snail not do taken into account in determining the maximum of compen sation and that such fees deposited in the Treasury since July 1st, 1878, must be reimbursed to them. The third bill provides that the President may rein state Captain Alfred lledbert in the United States Army by nominating and the confirmation with his former date of commission, and assign him the first vacancy in the infantry. Senator Teller reintroduced the fol lowing well known bill for the payment oi some live nuuureu thousand dollars to Ben. Holliday for losses sustained bv Indian depredations and while per- t ; . .1 1 . ! - lonmng overiauu man service. Senator Grover reintroduced his bill of last Congress to reimburse to the State of Oregon 131,000 for expendi tures during the Modoc war. Onitean Trial. Washington, Dec, 7. The criminal court was densely crowded this morn ing. Among the audience was Gen. Sherman and Rev. Dewitt Taimase. The prosecution commenced in re buttal demolishing the theory of insan ity. They will retraverso the ground gone over by the defense and from the stand point of the prosecution and thoroughly ventilate Guiteau's past life and habits beginning with his early life in Freeport and concluding with the vast amount of the best expert testi mony obtainable in the country As soon as the court formally opened Guiteau addressed the court thus: "May it please your honor, the American people do not desire this case to be tried over," and I do not desire it. I say with the utmost respect to this court and jury, and my counsel, Scoville, that I am sat isfied with the political situation as de veloped here in this case. That's the fist of this alleged offense. I say I ave a right as a matter of law of ap pearing as my own counsel. I ask your honor that Gen. Grant, Senators Conkling and Piatt and President Ar thur anu other of that kind of men who were so down on Garfield, they would not speak to him on the street and would not go to the White House, to put on the stand. I have a right to show my personal relations to these men. That I was cordially received by them and that 1 was well dressed and fed-nt the Fifth Avenue Hotel. Grant it to show my personal relations to those men. I don't want to except to your honor's ruling, but I shall be obliged to do so, antT I have no doubt the court will give me a new trial." Judge Cox Your exception has been noled. Scoville then called up, the subject of President Arthur's testimony and said he had not received any response to his interrogation that the Presidents evidence was absolutely essential to the defense. Guiteau interrupted him excitedly with, "I don't think it at all necessary for Gen. Arthur to be here." Scoville I don't care what you want, I am doing this myself. Guiteau I ask as a personal favor that he shall not be dragged into court. I think a good deal ót Gen. Arthur. He is President of the United States and 1 don't think he should be bother ed with this matter. (Striking the desk violently.) He is President of the United States and I made him so and 1 think I should have something to say in this matter. It was arranged between the councils that the President's answers should be put in as evidence at an3T stage of the trial and Sermllc called Gen. Sher man. The witness simply recited the orders he had issued for the disposition of troops at the time of the assignation. He identified the letter written by Guiteau, and said he suspected all the time there might be a conspiracy, but afterwards concluded the shooting was the act of one man. As he left the stand Guiteau said, "I thank you for having ordered out troops that day. If it had not been for you I should not be here to-day, I owe my life to the protection which you and General Crocker gave me during that period when mob spirit was rife.,! At this the General smiled grimly. Afterward II. Barton, a lawyer, A. T. Green and G. W. Gandir, all of Free port, Illinois, testified that they knew Guiteau' s family and considered all sane. Adjourned. The Flipper C'nup. Washington, Dec. 7. At the opening of court this morning Flipper made the following statement of the first charge and its specifications in his case. I declare to you in the most solemn and positive manner possible that 1 am perfectly innocent in every way, shape and form ; that I have never by myself, or by another appropriated, converted or applied to my own use a single dol lar or any of the Government money, or permitted it to be done, or author ized any meddling with it whatever. The funds for which I was responsible I kept in my quarters in my trunk be cause I felt more secure to have them in my own custody. On May 2nd I re ceived a telegram from General Small not to transfer any funds as he intend ed being absent from San Antonio. This I contrived to apply to every thing pertaining to funds. As I was not informed, some one he left to attend to the routine of business then during my absence, submitted my funds regularly to the commanding officer for inspection and did not make a state ment in consequence of the telegram of May 2nd. I thought it unnecessary and discontinued. For June the ac cumulated funds, after verification, I put in my trunk and they were not ex amined until July 8th, I then discover ed a discrepancy of $1,551. I did not know what todo but chose to put in my own check for the amount, intend ing to deposit personally in the Bank before required to remit. I relied on getting money from the publisher of my book who had promised it. I was disappointed 'again. 1 had no theory of how the shortage occurred and did not suspect the servant had made up the deficiency Senate. Washington, Dec. 7. The chair sub mitted certain proceeding of the Re formed Episcopal Church convention in New York on polygamy. Referred. A bill was introduced by Ingalls to enable the people of New Mexico to form a constitution and State govern ment and for admission into the Union. Allison introduced a bill authorizing the Postmaster-General to compensate the C. B. & Q. road for facilitating the transportation of the United States mails. The House resolution from special committee to consider all petitions, bills, etc. asking for woman suffrage was referred. The chair announced Morrill's tariff commission resolution and ordered him to take the lloor, but he being unwilling to speak to-day the Senate adjournetf. Comments on the Message. New York, Dec. 7. The Journal is rowded to-day with the President's message and documents incident to the opening of the new Congress. The message itself is universally well spoken of, particularly by the Republican and Independent sheets. The World says the message is full of views and the views are not pretended to be the views of the country, or even of the party, but only the personal opinions of President Arthur. No care ful reader of the message can fail to note this peculiarity and few reflective readers will bo at a loss to assign it to its true cause which made the letter of acceptance of the Republican candi date for Vice-President last year so much more ftutspoken and positive than the letter of the Republican candidate for President. The World concludes in regard to our foreign relations: "The President speaks with a force and clearness which will command the re spect of men of all parties." Dnvl Manifests Indignation. Washington, Dec. 7. When refering to his acceptance of the position of President of the Senate in his speech to day, Davis manifested considerable indignation in alluding to various news paper criticisms that ho had sold him self to the Republicans. He was very emphatic in the re-assertion that not a single word tending to commit him self to the Republicans passed between him and them prior to his acceptance of the position. His speech has made the Senate officials and employees happy. Mar Roate Philadelphia, Dec. 7. Civil suits against the alleged star route conspira tors came before Judge Butler and the jury in the United States District Court to-day. Verdicts were given against Benjamin B. Wiley for 7,5O0; 8,000, $8,000 and $400, amounts of bonds ac companying the principals for carrying mails on four routes for. which be was bidder. Judge Butler formed the opin ion that the (lovernment should have other and more direct evidence than that which it proposed to offer and a new jury will consider it. It the cases of Joseph Funk principal and Joseph R. Black and Henry C. Ar bucklc, his sureties, judgments were given for $1,975, $4,150, and $3,018, the amounts of contracts in which they were concerned. New Railroad Company. San Francisco, Dec. 7. A new rail roal company has been formed under the name of the Arizona and Navada Railroad and Navigation Company. It's object is the construction of a line between Caville, Nevada, and Yuma, with extensions by rail or water as may hereafter be determined, to Port Isabel and Libertad, on the Gulf of California. The company has been incorporated under the laws of Arizona, but has its principal business office in San Fran cisco. The capital stock is twenty mil lion dollars. The road will pass through the lino of mining district on the East tern bank of the Colorado river. From Port Iasbel the line will continue to Al tar and through the rich mining dis trict to Libertad. Violently Opnusett. New York, December 7. The Post's Washington special says: Western Congressmen, notably representatives from bullion producing States are vio lently opposed to the recommendations of the President and Secretary Folger that the coinage of the silver dollar be stopped and silver certificates be with drawn. Representative Belford.of Col orado, in speaking for their sentiment says: Such a policy will alienate bul lion States against which it discrimi nates. It will be as unpopular there as a suggestion to repeal the duty on iron would be in Pennsylvania. If Presi dent Arthur desires to make war on my State, I shall not support him in his policy. Explosion in a Candle Faetory. San Francisco, December 7. The loss by the explosion at the candle fac tory this morning is estimated at about $20,000. The bouer was of high pres sure, eighteen feet long, and two feet in diameter. A piece weighing a ton was thrown over a two-story building, and landed in a gravel pit a thousand yards distant. Other pieces of great weight were thrown against the wall of a warehouse and shattering adjoining buildings. Bricks, timber, grease and candles were distributed over the neigh borhood. That no lives were lost is al most miraculous. - F.oreijtii. 

CRIME NOT DIMINISHED." Dublin, Dec. 7. Justice Fitzgerald, in opening the Munster AssisSes, said the Government's peace measure which exceeded the anticipations of the most ardent advocate of tenant rights, caused no diminuation of crime. The number of indictments pending are doule that of last year. Taking Fast IIorwesEnst. Cheyenne, Dec. 7. O. A.

Benton, rank ing as major, and now goes east by or der of General Hancock. General Sleeting. Washington, Dec. 7. General Negley President of the Nation Council of the Union League of America, called a general meeting of the Council in Phil adelphia on the 14th of December. Convinced. Indianapolis, Dec. 7. Dr. Orphens says all experts on insanity here who have been summonsed in the Guiteau case, are convinced by the cross-examination of his responsibility. Arizona Nnielting Furnace. The following is a description of an inexpensive copper smelting furnace in use in Arizona: It is simply a largo perpendicular square frame, built of well dressed stone, and thirty feet high. Five feet from the top the feed opening is placed, and from there to the bed of the furnace it is fifteen feet. It has a capacity of fifteen tons daily. It has stout copper plates in the masonry where the heat will be the most intense. It will be firmly secured from damage by expansion by stout iron clamps. The slag and metal discharge openings are in front. The low position of the smelter gives little show for a slag dump, but that is lo be obviated by the erection of a derrick with a thirty foot arm, which lifts the slag pots and swings them sixty feet from the fur nace. The cost of the furnace does not exceed $700. The aggregate expenses of the courts in New Mexico for two years past foots up $73,810.43. This sum is divided as follows: Bernalillo county, $3,451.30: Colfax couuty,$3, 603.67; Dona Ana, $7, 839.83; Grant, $7,407.34; Lincoln, $4, 786.50; Mora, $4,504.30; Rio Arriba, $3.211.78; San Miguel, $13,490.16; San ta Fe, $14,264.69; Socorro, $2,857.62; Taos, $3,623.50; Valencia, $3,189.77; Supreme Court, January, 1881, $961.90. Jurors' and witnesses pay,' mileage, sheriffs1, district attorneys' and clerks' fees, are included in the above. In the court expenses of the first and second districts are included traveling expen ses for Judges Prince and Parks. Al buqaerquc Review.

A printer sat in his office chair; his boots weie patched and his coat thread bare; while his face looked weary and worn with care. While sadly thinking of business debt, old morphens around him slowly crept, and before he knew it he soundly slept, and sleeping he dreamed that he was dead; from trouble and toil his spirit had fled, and that not even a cow bell tolled for the peaceful rest of his cow hide sole. As he wander ed among the shades, smoke and scortch of hades, he shortly observed an iron door that creaking hung on hinges ajar, but that entrance was cros sed by a red-hot iron bar, and Satan himself stood peeping out and watch ing for travelers thereabout, and thus to the passing printer spoke and with growling voico the echoes woke, "Come in, my dear, it shall cost you nothing, and never fear; this is the place where I cook the ones that never .uay their subscription sums, for though in life they may escape, they will find when dead it is too late; I will show you the place where I melt them with red hot chains and scrape of tin, and also where I comb their heads with broken glass and melted lead; and if of refresh ments the y only think, there's boiling water for them to drink; there's the red hot grindstone to grind down his nose, and if they mention they don't like fire, I'll sew up their mouths with red-hot wire; and then, dear sir, you should see them squirm while I roll them over and cook them to a turn. At these last words the printer awoke, and thought it all a practical joke; but still at times so real did it seem, that he cannot believe it was all a dream: and often he thinks with a chuckle ana grin of the fate of those who save their tin and never pay the printer. The Ilead-Lincr. The professors of journalism who pe riodically tell us about newspapers have failed to notice a comparatively mod ern and a very important feature of tbe newspaper, namely, the head-lines. This is a department of the paper wheh has stealthily conquered for itself an influence which even newspaper managers sometimes inadequately re cognize, It often happens that the in genious artist in this department is really editing the paper. He can con vey an impression which the writers of ponderous leaders are trying to avoid. He can create a doubt or a waken a sus picion by a single artfully-chosen word or sow broadcast an opinion which it may take columns of writing to show is unfounded. Suggestions that are bur ied in the bodies of articles may attract no notice; but the flaming head-line takes the eye at once, and its diagnosis of the matter which it criticises may be very wide off the mark without the av erage reader applying any corrective. The head-line largely regulates the em phasis that is given to the report of cur rent events. Small matters in this way may be magnified, and mere conjec tures invested with nearly the dignity of established facts. Toronto Mail. Humorous. America is a country where a man's statement is not worth two cents un less backed up with an ofl'erto bet you $10. . ' A correspondent wants to know how "burnt umber" is made. Very likely the makers have to cucumber to get the burnt article. When a man gives you his left hand to shake, it is sate to infer that he has done something with his right hand that he is ashamed of. Couldn't tell a lie: An honest Hiber nian, when asked if he had a pleasant time at the picnic replied: "I'll not desave ye, sorr; it was a dull time; sorra a black eye on the ground till after 3 o'clock.
