DECISION OF THE VATICAN. The decision of the Vatican, which in the form of answers to specific estions. may be summarized as fol **: present car shortage. The object of the heads of the Union Pacific system is to prevent a recurrence, if possi ble, of the present unfortunate condi tions. Orders have been placed for 350 locomotives, also for 1907 delivery. This announcement was made by Geaeral Manager O'Brien of the Har riman lines in the Northwest. ''The difficulty in getting new cars is largely due to the fact that much of the material has to come from this territory," said be. "Orders placed here by car builders amount to large total, and the difficulty is in delivering it. Of course, this must be hauled east before the cars can be built. We have arranged with the car builders to haul a large number of loads from O. R. A N. territory, consisting of lumber chiefly, with the provision that the shops using the materials shall put it into the cars now being built for us. Almost every car-building estab lishment in the country is said to be swamped with orders for cars which cannot be filled as promplty as would otherwise be the case, because of the rush of work and because of the diffi culty in getting the materials. It is said 2,000 freight cars remain to be delivered to the Harrimau lines on last years' orders which the shops have not yet been able to turn out. Postoffice Report. Wahsingtou, D.

YAKIMA MAN HAS GONE North Yakima, Dec. 10.—Deep mystery surrounds the disappearance of N. Lewis Morois, a wealthy Klou diker who has not been seen since Tuesday night, when he bade farewell to his sweetheart, Miss Ambrosia \ Adams, a comely young school teach- J er of Weuas, saying he was go lug to ride 15 miles to North Yakrna and would return to her Friday. Wednesday his saddled horse was found near the ford of the Naches river, a mile north of North Inkimit. but no trace of him has been discov ered. Miss Adams and his family be lieve that he lias met with foul play. They state that many persons knew that he had just returned from Alas ka and they were aware he carried large sums in a belt about his waist. Their opinion is that some thug knew this, follows i him, murdered him and lias hidden tbe body. Tbe theory is partly substaut iated by stories of persons who heard cries for help in the northern portion of the city late Tuesday night or W «-d nesdav ruing. Many persons re sidin': !. the big mill ditch heard j some lie ■•yh for assistance sud i several no r. . r v to learn the 'M'cr of the out cr but could flic! noth lug. Next day seme reported the ! facts to the police asking if anyone i had been killed iu the neighborhood that night No complaint had been j made to the police, j Another theory advanced is that iu j attempt ing to ford the Naches river ; Marois was swept into a deep hole, carried from his horse and drowned. He had forded the riTer before, but | I not at night. Searchers traveled far down the river today, hut the body was not found. thrown from his horse and killed or was drwtftffd to death, the body ber*tf in the sagebrush between Weuas and !

Mitcbel, general agent of the North ern Pacific in Spoknne, believe* there is a possibility, if not a probability, of tbe Northern Pacific meeting the lumber rate made from Kpokauw to Dakota points by the Spokane Inter net iot uI railway company "1 canimt say positively," said Mr Mitchell yesterday, "hut there is Ilk. ditto.<1 of such a step being tak ell The rate from points in the f.u-ur d'Alene territory to the Dako tas t- the same us over our road. Practically no lumber is shipped from Hp- kane to the Dakotas and the rate made by the Spokan* International does u< t have much effect on this ter ritory." C. H Campbell, general agent of the Great Northern in Spokane, said that the rates made by the Spokane International did not affect bis road in the least. "We do not reach the Coeur d'Alene territory and little luail*er is shipped out of Spokai* destined to the Dakotas." he said. "Of course, it may hurt th» lumber husiu.-es of tbe coast, but as the him ler shipped from this district doe* not compare with tbs craust product. I do not think the rates will make auy material difference."
