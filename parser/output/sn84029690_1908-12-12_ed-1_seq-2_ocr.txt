LISTEN TO MESSAGE COMMUNICATION FROM PRESI DENT READ TO CONGRESS. New Laws and Changes ,in Existing Statutes Are Among Recom mendations Made by the Chief Executive. Washington, Dec. 8. President Roosevelt's message to congress, which was read in both houses to-da, contained many important recom mendations as to legislation which he considers urgent. ' The financial standing of the coun try, the president points out, . is at present excellent, but there is great need that the currency commission proceed at once to remedy existing de fects. The president repeats with empha sis his views, hitherto expressed, that for the good of the country the con trol of great corporations, and espe cially the railroads, must be placed in the hands of the national government. The Sherman anti-trust law he con demns as positively harmful in its workings, urging as a substitute a law which shall expressly permit combina tions which are in the interest of the public, but shall at the same time give to some agency in the national govern ment full power of control and super vision over them. In the interests of the wageworkers of the country the president urges the prohibition of child labor, diminution of women labor, and shortening of hours of all mechanical labor. There should be, he says, a progressive in heritance tax on large fortunes. The matter of taking care of the wageworkers, who, under our present industrial system, become killed, crip pled, or worn out as part of the regu lar incidents of a given business, is gone into at length, and a system of industrial old-age pensions Indorsed. The president recommends that, be ginning with the supreme court, the salaries of judges be doubled. Demands for legislation made by certain labor leaders on the last con gress come in for sharp criticism, be ing described as unjust and impracti cal, and opposed to the real interests of the workers. The much-discussed power of Injunc tion the president considers a great equitable remedy, which must on no account be destroyed, though he con siders that safeguards should be erect ed against its abuse. Immediate hear ings of cases, following the issuance of an injunction, he thinks, would da much toward disarming criticism of tho courts. Discussing measures necessary for the proper control of giant corpora tions operating in defiance of law, the president says: "Real damage has been done by the manifold and conflicting interpreta tions of the interstate commerce law. Control over the great corporations do ing interstate business can be effec tive only if it is vested with full power in an administrative department, a branch of the federal executive, carry ing out a federal lar; it can never be effective if a divided respon sibility is left in both the states and the nation; it can never be effective If left In the hands of the courts to be decided by lawsuits." Immediate action toward the preser vation of the existing forest', is pat forward as a national duty. In the opinion of the president, ac tion by the present session of con gress for the improvement of our in land waterways is imperative. He recommends the creation of a perma nent commission authorized to co ordinate tho work of all the govern ment departments relating to water ways, and to frame and supervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. The Immediate institution of postal savirgs banks, recommended in previ ous messages, Is again urged, together with the establishment of a parcel post service for the mutual benefit of the farmer and the country store keeper. High praise is accorded all those responsible for the expeditious work being done on the Panama canal, and the extension of tne ocean mall act of 1891 urged, to the end that Amer ican ocean mail lines to the east may be established. Real progress, the president de clares, is being made in the Philip pines, and the outlook is declared bright. Steps to maintain and Increase the present efficiency of the National Guard is another recommendation of the message. The services of well trained army officers with the militia are shown to have had excellent re sults. The system of promotion by merit in the army, displacing the hitherto prevailing system of seniority, is de fended as vital to the good of the service. The message concludes with the recommendation of a lare increase in the navy. It is desirable, the presi dent says, to complete as soon as pos sible a squadron of eight battleships of best existing type. A Leading Question. Superintendent McLaren of Saa Francisco's system of public parks was inspecting the work of restoring Union square to its former beauty, now that the little St. Francis has been re moved.

May Be Iron Ore. What is believed to be a rich strike of iron ore has been discovered by A. J. Meers, a prospector of much experience who has been living in the Wichita moun tains for several years. Samples of the ore will be assayed immediately and the value of the find will be known. There is an almost inex haustible supply o fthe ore. 5 No More School Lands Leased. State Auditor James Nation has tak en the initial step to stop the leasing of school lands in western Kansas.

In the meantime the auditor will approve no more leases.' Teachers' To Meet at Hutchinson. The annual meeting of the Central Kansas Teachers' association will meet in Hutchinson April 1, 2 and 3. This meeting is to take the place of the one held in past years at Thanks giving time. At the meeting a year ago it was decided to discontinue the Thanksgiving meeting, but instead hold the annual sessions in the spring. Carr Trial in February. The last official act in Marion county of Judge Morse was an order to County Clerk Woolheater to draw a petit jury of two hundred names. This is the first step in the trial of William Thomas Carr at the February term, at which time Judge R. L. King will preside.. Whether the next jury will acquit, or do as the first one did, disagree, is a hard question to answer. Wife Deserter to Reformatory. J. C. Castle, who eloped from Welling ton a few weeks ago with Melvlna Hathaway, a young telephone opera tor, deserting his -wife and Infant child, and who subsequently deserted the girl at Goldfield, Nev., was tried in the district court.

The Southern Kansas Teachers' as sociation, comprising nine counties in Kansas and two counties in Oklaho ma, closed a very successful session at Arkansas City. About 500 teachers were in attendance. Lee Harrison, county superintendent of Sumner county, was elected president of the association, and" John F. Bender of Arkansas City was elected vice presi dent. The next annual session will be held in Wichita. Drowned in Little Osage. Miss Ha zel Hunsaker, a 13-year-old girl who lived with her widowed mother on a farm about three miles south of Kln caid, was drowned in the Little Osage, a stream that runs through that sec tion. The. body was recovered two hours later. Carr Had Chance to Escape. Sheriff Mansfield thus far has no trace of the daring jail breaker, Montague, who was awaiting trial at Marion for bur glarizing the Rock Island depot at Peabody some time ago. Montague managed to dig his way to liberty by removing a stone in .the west waH, near the south corner, last Saturday night, using as an instrument a bro ken case knife. The dirt was skil fully concealed under newspapers and "s in the exercise corridor and the -ier prisoner; William Thomas Carr, who is accused, of murdering Expres3 Messenger Bailey at Newton and in default of bail awaits trial during the February term, could also have es caped but refused the opportunity, preferring the risk or a Kind-hearted Call for State Bank Reports W. S. Albright, state bank commissioner, is sued a call requiring all state banks to send in statements showing their condition at the close of business Nov. 27. The result of. this call will be awaited with interest by bankers over the state. The last statement issued early in the fall by the department broke all records. There is no appar ent reason for a decline since that time and it is expected that the com ng statement will show even a bet ter condition than was shown by the last statement. Mayor Drove Silver Spike. Mayor J. J. Paddock of Manhattan drove the first spike in the construction of the Manhattan City and Interurban rail road being built in that city. Just be for the ceremony of driving the silver spike the mayor gave a short address, in which he told of improvements now going on in Manhattan, among which he" mentioned the new telephone sys tem, new electric light plant, new sewer system, and the construction cf a dam across the Elae river to be uei fir 2 electric rower rlirt. Bank Deposits Increase. A call for statements from national banks of their condition at the close of busi ness November 28, has been made and the statements of the Wichita na tional banks show that they have on deposit $7,138,657. One year ago the deposits amounted to $5,178,737. Qualify on $2,200,000 Bonds. Mark Tulley has filed his new bond for state treasurer to cover his next term of office. Although the law only re quires him to give a million dollar bond, he gave a $1,100,000 bond this time, and the remarkable thing about it is that he raised all the bond in his home county Montgomery. Twenty nine men in that county qualified for $2,200,000, or double tne amount of the bond. Six men alone went on the bond for $750,000, qualifying for $1,- 500,000. They are A. C. Stich, A. W. Shultls, G. T. Guernsey, R. S. Litch field, P. S. Hollingsworthv and H. F. Sinclair. - Limit on Meals, 75 Cents. State Auditor Nation has served notic on all state officers who gad around at state expense that after this he would only permit them to pay 75 cents for a meal on dining cars. That is the state would allow them no more than that amount. Officers who leave To peka in the morning for Kansas C'ty will not be reimbursed for their break fast on the train. Nation says they should eat at home before starting. "Seventy-five cents worth of grub i3 enough for any man at one meal," said Nation, "and that is all the state pro poses to pay for. If some official wants to gorge himself and pay more why he will have to pay the differ ence out of his own pocket." Gross Earnings $5,600,000. Bank Commissioner Albright" has issued a statement showing that stockholders of Kansas state and private banks re ceived 11.88 per cent in dividends on their stock during the past year. Of the 737 banks, 493 only paid dividends. Most of the others were either new banks or passed dividends for ' some reason. The average dividend of the 493 banks was 17.97 per cent. Count ing in all banks those that paid divi dends and those that didn't, the aver age dividend was 11.88 per cent. Of ficers of banks received $1,097,000 in salaries or 8.42 per cent of the bank ing capital. Bank taxes aggregated 1.81 per cent of the total capital. The gross earnings on the $12,600,000 cap ital were $5,6000, or 44 per cent. More than $600,000 was paid by banks as interest on deposits. Dividends ag gregated $1,500,000. November Was a Wet Month. Dur ing the month of November, according to the monthly weather statement is sued by the University of Kansas, 3.93 inches of water fell, which is 2.1 inches above the customary average. Only four Novembers in the entire forty years that the record was kept were wetter than the month just closed. This will raise the total amount of the rainfall for the year to 47.92 inches, which Is more than a foot above the usual monthly average. No vember was not only a record breiker from the standpoint of rainfall, but also from the amount and velocity of the wind run. Total run of wind during the month was the smallest in forty years. The record has been kept at the university. All through No vember the month was exceedingly calm for this season of the year, and it was not surprising when the report showed that the month had been the calmest ever recorded for November In Kansas. Banner Prohibition County. Sedg wick county is the banner prohibition county of Kansas, and Crawford is the banner Socialist county. That is shown In the official election returns. Sedgwick county cast more prohibi tion votes than any other county in Kansas. Its total for the party's pres idential nominee was 247. Crawford county cast 1,631 Socialist votes. Cherokee county also has a lot of Socialists, 1,030 votes for Debs being polled. To Recover School Lands. Attor ney General Fred S. Jackson has filed suit in the Kearney county district court to recover three quarter sec tions of the school land from J. N. White, L. G. Eyman and I. G. Eyman. He claims that these men secured the land for $1.25 an acre through a con spiracy formed with certain county officials there and that the land is worth from $5 to $10 an acre. On ac count of the alleged fraud perpetrated in securing the land so cheaply, the attorney general wants their deed3 to it cancelled, and the property restored to the state. Olpe Bank is Robbed. Robber3 en tered the State Bank at Olpe, ten miles south of Emporia, blew open the safe and got away with $2,000 in cash. Wichita Starts Hospital Fund. Fif teen hundred ' dollars in round num bers was the sum raised in the Union Thanksgiving services in Wichita as a nest egg that is expected to grow, until it has reached $25,000, to be used as an endowment fund for the Wich ita hospitaL It was a general free will offering from the people "of the city, irrespective of religious belief, to aid a worthy institution.

CIVILISAT LL Chr istendom again celebrates the nativity of the foun der of the Christian faith, and the inaug uration of the new year. The heart yields to the pre vailing spirit and sentiment, despite intellectual dissent. Not to observe, in some form, the Christmas festival is felt to do vio lence to the best Instincts of humanity. This holiday eclipses all other birthdays, as the sun makes the electric light to cast a shadow. At this season a large majority find delight in giving. It gives occasion for springs of human kindness and good will to flow. It challenges the charge that man i3 innately and persistently selfish. More than is believed practice the truth that Is more blessed to give than to receive. Christmas is the festival of children and women. Christ's conception of childhood and youth and his treat ment of women made it possible for them to commemorate his birthday with joy and gladness. At the out set of his career he foretold the reg nancy of the cradle and the glory of the woman. Christmas celebrates the birth of a child to whom the world owes the progress of 1,900 years, and whose work will endure so long as earth shall continue and influence oth er worlds. NINETEEN centuries ago a peasant woman of Judea in a stable gave birth to a child destined to do the greatest possible work to free all women from bondage and all children from slavery the evils which dis graced past ages. Jesus' influence upon humanity as a child, a man, a teacher and as a Saviour, as one who put the eternal right of man above all established customs and precedents, is the greatest inheritance of the hu man race. The king of the Jews has become the king of the world. A He brew mind with no racial bias is now ruling the nations. The spirit of the Christ most deeply moves modern life and thought. His name has passed over our institutions and his mind has penetrated into our social and domes tic existence. The inspiration of true liberty and education, the benediction of the beautiful, the elevation of let ters, literature and morals are ascribed to him. HIS influence upon the centuries Is as clearly marked as the eur- rents of the Gulf Stream bring ing verdure and beauty to Inhospitable shores, light to those in darkness, and making the wilderness to blossom as the rose. Innumerable poems, dramas and songs have been developed through his teaching. Art taxes itself fittingly to portray his life, architect ure struggles to build temples suitable for his worship. Universities, col leges, schools, "and all systems of edu cation attempt to realize his esti mate of the dignity and worth of child hood. "Government itself," said Glad stone, "is but the translation of the teachings of Jesus Christ into human laws and institutions." His thoughts and ideas toil like a giant for man's progress. The single historic vine in Santa Barbara carried to California by a priest has changed all the industries of that land, so Christ's ideas carry energies for civilizing worlds. "As the sun upon the horizion rolls forward, pouring forth warmth out of its in visible urns, so we perceive an atmos phere of hope and joy has been poured over the continent out of the heart of Christ and those who loved him." The world celebrates at Christ mas the advent of this wonderful be ing. It looks reverently upon the face of him, the feeble infant in the man ger, and upon other children to whom be gave so much. CHILDREN and Christmas are the factors of civilization. Edmund Burke defined civilization as "the spirit of a gentleman, and the spirit of religion in a life lived in the presence of man and God." ,The beauty, purity, humility, faith, helplessness and the promise, of chil dren educate the parents in affection and gentleness, and through them the community. The spring whence civ ilization flows is the Babe of Mary, and the babe in every home. The Christmas spirit Incarnated in deeds of kindness, of self-forgetfulness, love, mutual helpfulness, is the secret of Christian civilization. ; It .will inoculate all the world with that purpose to do justice and deal kindly with our fellows. Christianity has been defined as "a beautiful civ ilization slowly journeying across the earth." It is the only civilization worthy to be named. It presents ideals, with the power to realize them. A (EhriBtmas (tttirnl - ' : - W&jf I I heB the Greai Love came to the' I I jrl?liZ ! stable door if JXi I I And entered io. II ION THERE were individuals who re flected ideal virtues in other periods, but were unable to mul tiply themselves, dying like Beatrice, who took her beauty, as they carried their moral excellences away with them. The first Christmas dawned on a world of selfishness and sin, and dark with folly and cruelty. There was beauty for the few, slavery, pov erty and starvation for the many, death for the unwelcome child and degradation for woman. There were 375,000 paupers in a population of 1,000,000 in Rome. It was a period of intellectual chaos, moral and social desolation, and individual hopeless ness. Into this gloom came the star of Bethlehem, beaming light, hope" and sympathy. .... The contrast between the manger birth' and the Christmas morn that will dawn this week with its carols, songs, gifts, joy and gladness, is the most striking contrast earth's history holds. With that first Christmas childhood became sweet and sacred, woman was crowned queen of the heart and home, the slave made free, the ignorant, poor and wretched found education, shelter and sympathy, and the joy of gener osity became contagious. As the sun rises earlier and lingers longer than yesterday so the spirit of Christmas will usher in the golden age of happi ness and good will. In the great pic ture of Coreggio the light on the face of the babe lends a glow to shepherd and wise men. The Christmas spirit lends a glow to all the Instruments and forces of society. HILE Jiumanity falls below the ideal, the effort to practice it is not wholly nugatory. The "drift of the world Is upward." The people are climbing. Interest in chil dren is increasing. Woman is coming to her own. Labor is entering the reward of ' work. War is becoming unpopular. Racial prejudice will hide in sham. The Christ spirit is vic torious. God's good will becomes tri umphant In home, street and legis lative hall. The triumphs of the past dictate new struggles for the future. When Pericles gave his oration over, the Athenian dead, pointing to. the graves, the great orator said: "Their silence is eloquent! These heroes ask us to go and live for the city for which they died." Thus past achievements pledge us to fresh fidelity. Christ mas asks us to lend the impulse of a new love to home, school, street and city ; to be a friend of the friendless, a benefactor to some dumb beast or deserted child, to be voice for tie dumb, eyes for the blind, springs of water for the thirsty, trees of shade for the weary, food for the hungry, refuge for the smitten. Be an angel of mercy, bringing "peace on earth and good will toward men," and thus hasten a Christmas which will not simply come to-morrow, but will stay all the year. TWO DINNERS FOR CHRISTMAS. Menus in Which Roast Beef and Goose Are the Leading Entrees. For the Christmas feast roast beef or roast young goose are the prime fa vorites, taking the precedence of tur key, which very soon after the first of December begins to lose its delicacy of flavor.

Cain, the trouble maker, got into action be fore Tubal Cain, the iron worker; and Eve got Adam into hot water long-, before the Boiler Makers union began business. There are three kinds of trouble imaginary, borrowed and real. Imaginary trouble consists of rail road accidents, earthquakes, fires, sui cides, the poorhouse, death, and'the grave, carefully mixed and taken after a late dinner, or a drop in the stock market. Borrowed trouble is the kind we get from our relatives. Its principal in--gredients are visits, borrowed money,. . . birthday presents, advice and expecta- -tions.

Home laundering would be equal ly satisfactory if proper attention was given to starching, the first essential being good Starch, which has sufficient strength to stiffen, without thickening the goods. Try Defiance Starch and you will be pleasantly surprised at th improved appearance of your work. Grown-Up Children. It Is not only the frivolous whom the spirit of childishness is just now leading astray. Silliness is the fash ion even among the wise. Women especially affect a kind of childish shrewdness in talking of serious sub jects.
