Ppproved, July 4, 1866. , - PRESlDENfSMESSAGE. MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE TWO HOU SES OF CONGRESS AT THE COM MENCEMENT OF THE SECOND SES SION. Fellow- Citizins of the Senate and House of Representative : After a brief interval the Congress of the United States resumes its annual legislative labors. An all-wise and mer ciful Providence has abated the pesti lence which visited our shores, leaving its calamitous traces upon some portions ojf our country. Peace, order, tranquil lity, and civil authority have been for mally declared to exist throughout the whoh' of the United States. In all of tiie States civil authority has superseded the coercion of arms, and the people, by their voluntary action, are maintaining their governments in full activity and complete operation. The enforcement of the laws is no longer "obstructed in any State by combinations too power ful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings ;" and the animosities engendered by the war are rapidly yielding to the beneficent influences of our free institutions, and to the kindly effects of unrestricted so cial and commercial intercourse. An entire restoration of fraternal feeling must be the earnest wish of every pa triotic heart ; and we will have accom plished our grandest national achieve ment when, forgetting the sad events of the past, and remembering only their instructive lessons, we resume our on ward career as a free, prosperous, and united people. In my message of the 4th of Decem ber, 1865, Congress was informed of tho measures which had been instituted by the Executive with a view to the gra dual restoration of the States in which the insurrection occurred to their rela tions with the General Government. Provisional Governors had been appoin ted, Conventions called, Governors elec ted, Legislatures assembled, and Sena tors and Representatives chosen to the Congress of the United States. Courts had been opened for the enforcement of laws long in abeyance. The blockade had been removed, custom-houses re established, and the internal revenue laws put in force, in order that the peo ple might contribute to the national in come. Postal operations had been re newed, and efforts were being made to restore them to their former condition of efficiency. The States themselves had been asked to take part in the high function of amending the Constitution, and of thus sanctioning the extinction of African slavery as one of the legiti mate results of our internecine struggle. Having progressed thus far, the Ex ecutive Department found that it had accomplished nearly all that was within the scope of its constitutional authority. One thing, however, yet remained to be done before the work of restoration could be completed, and that was the admission to Congress of loyal Senators and Representative from the . States whose people had rebelled against the lawful authority of the General Gov ernment. This question devolved npon the respective Houses, which, by the Constitution, are made the judges of the elections, returns, and qualifications of their own members ; and its consid eration at once engaged the attention of Congress. In the meantime, the Executive De partment no other plan having been proposed by Congress continued its efforts to perfect, as far as was practica ble, the restoration of the proper rela tions between the citizens of the respec tive States, the States, and the Federal Government, extending, from time tc time, as the public interests seemed to require, the judicial, revenue, and pos tal systems of the country. With ,th advice and consent of the Senate,, the necessary officers were appointed, and appropriations made by Congress' for the payment of their salaries. The pro position to amend the Federal Consti tution, so as to prevent the existence of slavery within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction, was ratified by the requisite number of States ; and on the 18th day of Decem ber, 1865, it was officially declared to have become valid as a part of. the Con stitution of the United Stated ; All of the States in which the insurrection had existed promptly amended their Con stitutions, so as to make them conform to the great change thus effected in the organic law of the land ; declared null and void all ordinances and laws of se cession ; repudiated all pretended debts and obligations created for the revolu tionary . purposes of the insurrection ; and proceeded, in good faith, to the enactment of measures for the protec tion and amelioration of tbe condition of the colored race. Congress, how ever, yet hesitated to admit any of these States to representation ; ana Jt was not nntil towards the close of the eighth month of the session that an exception
