The message, read In both houses .simul taneously on Tuesday, is not only the first message sent by President Cleveland to congress, but it is the first that has eman ated from a Democratic Executive in a quarter of a century. Of all the messages of late years not one was so looked forward to or so carefully scanned when it made its appearance. Not less anxiety was manifested by those who bitterly opposed the president, as to what it would contain, than by those who weie during the contest and are now staunchly his friends. To those who thus opposed lum it reveals President Cleveland as a wise and prudent statesman, and to those who were and are his friends it is but a confinna'l m of their wisdom In supporting him. It shows him to be as purely a business mau In public affairs as lie was in the con duct of his own private interests, and that in dlsrliargins the duties of his ofllce he Is not laying aside all business rules and prin ciples to indulge In vargatles ami theoriz ing. Every line and every word in the mes sage but strengthens tlie belief that with him "public olllce is a public trust," held for the benefit of the people and not for purposes of private gain and personal ends. It is thorougly illustrative of his integrity of character and strength of purpose to so administer the affairs of government as to have all the people benefitted by its proper conduct and not a favored few. lly this message the President has com pletely allayed all fears that may have bi-wn honestly entertained by the business inter ests of the country and completely refuted those who w Ickedly taught that a change In administration meant ruin to the com mercial allairs of the country, in an its parts the message Is wise and conservative determined in the suggestion of needed reforms but counseling the wisdom of moderation in bringing them about. The parts of the message that have at tracted the most attention and called forth the greatest comment are those devoted to the "Tariff," the "Silver" question, the "Mxmon" question and "Civil Service." Whilst we would have preferred to have had the president more explicit upon the subject of tariff reform, yet we are content as the president's utterances in his message taken in connection with those contained in the report of the Secretary ot the Treas ury, show a determination on his part to bring about if possible a reduction in the amount of excess of revenue annually ac cumulated from our false and illy-adjusted tariff system. Upon this subject the president fays that "the fact that our revenues are in excess of the actual needs of an economical adminh. tration of the government justifies a redur. lion in the amount exacted from the people for its support," and that government "Is never better administered and Its true spirit is never better observed than when the peoples' taxation for its support is scrupu lously limited to the actual necessity of ex. penditures and distributed according to a just and equitable plan." His remedy Is to reduce "the revenues derived from a tax upou imported necessa ries of life," and "thus directly lessen the cost of living in every family In the land, and release to the public In every family in the land, and in every humble home a larger measure of the rewards of frugal Industry." Upon the subject of the suspension of a further coinage of "silver" dollars, the message is very explicit and is in accord with the sentiments expressed In the War ner letter of February. The reasons given by the president fully justify him In advis lng such suspension. The continued and compulsory coinage of silver without either the means or the disposition to circulate it must inevitably bring financial disaster upon us. The fact that it has not already created a marked financial disturbance he nays has resulted from good fortune and not lwcause no harm ran be wrought by unlim ited and continued coinage. As the presi dent very tersely says: We have now on hand all the silver dol Jars necessary to supply the present needs of the people, and to satisfy those who from sentiment w ish to see them in circu lation, and if their coinage is suspended they can be readily obtained by all who desire them. If the need of more Is it any time apparent their coinage may be re newed. That disaster has not already over taken us furnished no proof that danger does not wait upon a continuation ot the present silver coinage. We have been Mved by the most careful management and unusual expedients, by a combination of fortunate conditions and by a confident ex pectation that the commerce of the govern ment in regard to silver coinage would be speedily changed by an action of congress. Prosperity hesitates upon our threshold be cause of dangers and uncertainties sur rounding this question. Capital timidly shrinks from trade, and investors are un willing to take the chance of the question able shape la which their money will be returned to them, while enterprise halts at a risk against which care and sagacious management do not protect. As a neces aary consequence labor lacks employment and Buffering and distress are visited upon t portion of our fellow-cltlzeHt- especially entitled to the careful consideration of those charged with the duties of legislation. No Interest appeals to us so strongly for a safe and stable currency as the vast army of the unemployed. The democratic party cannot afford to as sume any wavering financial policy. In the past It has suffered much from the vagaries of demagogiam, and in this matter It must listen to the dictates of business principles and of sound judgment, and not be lead off . .1 ,.n.,1ijin he Is as tenacious of his faith in it as on the day of bis inauguration, an. Ppeiiklii,' doubtless from his personal experience with the ofilce seeking class since his in duction Into the presidential office and his coming to know how otlices had hcretoiore been dispensed, he says: "Civil service ref'irm came none too soon to check the progress of political demoralization." No subject appeals so earnestly to im supporters of President Cleveland as does this subject of civil service, mat ne is ri"ht In the position assumed by him all must know. His position is but the result and the logical outcome of u proper con ception of the conduct of the government a belief in the truth that as many and as exacting rules of business should be ap plied to the transaction or affairs of state as in the conduct of Individual matters. "Civil service reform" is a teaching that appeals to the patriotism of the citizen. It does not destroy proper partisanship it is destructive simply of a narrow personal greed for oflice an evil so fast taking hold upon our people as to make it an impera tive duty on the part of all good citizens, irrespective of party affiliations, to aid the president In iiisiieierminauoniorooiiiouv The seeking and holding of an oflice for the good of the public service is right and . . I ... .1 1 f .

FOR 

LIFE OR DEATH. The Trial of Peter A. Weast for the Murder of Thos. B- Parks Occupies the Attention of the Court this Week. S.NOTII1.K NOT.t ltl.K .Ml' HI) Kit Tit I A I. VKASTS MASCOT. Not since the celebrated trial of William Russell has the criminal court of this county attracted so much attention as during the past week, when Peter Weast, of Streator, was brought before the bar to answer for the death of Thomas Parks, of Benson. Tlie Russell case was one sufficient to sicken the stoutest heart with its revolting horrors. It was one of the foulest crimes that ever cov ered with the blood of its victim the fair name of any county in this state. On May C, 1878, little Maggie Cuddy, a child scarce ly nine years of age, left her home near L'tica to go to a neighbor's for a kitten. That was the last seen of her alive. Two weeks after her body was found in a ravine near the tun nel on the Rock Island road. On the body was found a stone weighing 800 pounds and another weighing 75. There were unmis takable evidences that the child had been ravished. Walsh, a young man who was subsequently arrested, but afterwards liber ated, testified that "she was alive and kick ing when they put her under the water" and rolled the huge stones on ber little body. The trial began on Oct. "8 of the same year, and on Nov. 9 following a verdict was brought in by the jury of "Not guilty." That Wil liam Russell committed this worse than mur derous deed, for which poor little Maggie Cuddy suffered a horrible death, and for which her blood still cries aloud to heaven for vengeance, tbofc familiar with the history of that remarkable trial and acquittal firmly believe, and will until time b1 all be no more. In that case a sense of outraged justice was given expression in ttie verdict of acquittal. There is but little or no parallel, however, tietween these cases. In the trial of Russell there were no mitigating circumstances as in tint of Weast, which began on Monday. In both of these cases James W. Duncan and K. F. Bull figured conspicuously as leading counsel fur the defense, materially aided in this instance by the fine Italian hand of Geo, W. W. Blake, who has of late years acquired a reputation as one of the ablest criminal lawyers at the Ottawa bar. It will be remembered that on Friday af ternoon, Oct. 0, between the houre of 2 and 3 o'clock, the shooting of Thomas B. Parks occurred, in room 4.1 of tbe Plumb House, Streator. The bullet took effect in Lis left thigh, severing the femoral artery. After enduring seveial surgical operations, one of them, the last, the amputation of the leg, and suffering untold agonies for three weeks, he died Sunday, Nov. I, at a quarter past 6 in the morning. As be was dying he made a solemn protestation ot his innocence of the charge of undue intimacy between Mrs. Weast and himself. In addition to the regular panel, a spet-iat venire of 60 jurors had been called, who were all on hand Monday noon, and tbe wort of impaneling a jury was begun at 2 o'clock. Previous to that every available neat in tbe Circuit Court room was occupied by an eager crowd ; the inclosure was almost filled up with attorneys and those interested in the case as w'unecses. A half an Lour after tbt opening of eonH, presided over by by the theories or an empty aenuiiiruw...-..-The vigorous treatment of the "Mor mon" question is in line with that com menced during the last year of President Arthur term, and carries out to their limit the statement made by the president when he was culled upon by the Mormon delega tion that the law relative to polygamy should and must be enforced. We trust that congress will act on the suggestion made "that a law be passed to prevent the importation of Mormons into tliis country. With such a law enacted ami vigorously enforced the " Mormon" problem would not be so difficult of solution. Despite the criticism thut has been passed upon the president by many within the ranks of his own party, for his belief in Civil Service He form, and the sneering remarks of those openly opposed to him, Judce Blanchard. Peter Weast. the defend ant, was brought In by the deputy sheriffs. He wore a light blue uvercoat of broadcloth, of the Prince Albert style; his liair was closely cut, and his general appearance was that of much cure and study as to his toilet. Soon afterwards lie arose and followed his attorneys, Jus. W. Duncan, Geo. W. W. Blake, K. F. Bull and Clarence Griggs, to the jury room for consultation. Tiie prosecution had for the interests of the people, along with State's Attorney Moloney, Henry .Mayo, and A. P. Wright, of Streator. Near these gen tlemen sat (lie brothers of the dead man, J. B and A. 1. Parks, both of Ottawa, Kansas. The former is a dealer in lands ami live Mock, and the latter is an agent for a firm in Burlington, Iowa. Another brother, James, is a resident ot'Joliet, but he was not present. At the adjournmint of court the first day four jurors had been obtained. A short time previous to the adjournment the prosecuting attorney arose and said that he wished to make a statement ; lie wanted to know if a man named Lee, of Streator, was in the court. Leo was thereupon brought before . . . i , . 1 i. I 'ie Judge, when .Mr. yoioney mane y e oi- 

IIIWIII); Slllirim -ill . i iii.vc nrcn i-.t this man on last Saturday stated in Forbes' store, in the presence of bystanders, that he tin I been summoned as a member of the spe cial jury, and that if selected as a juror lie would remain out forever before he brought in a verdict of guilty. He stated that lie . . . , . 1 . t . 1 i I..., II . would fee lie oilier jurors, nnu ihhi.mi. Duncan wanted dim on thejury and Moloney ili. I nut. Such a man. vour Honor, should he severely reprimanded." The attorney here read an affidavit from Marshal Malier, who was present when Lee made the remarks in Forbes store. J lie attorneys liere got mixed up in an altercation in regard to the matter, which was promptly squelched ty Judge Iilanchard, who remarked that he did not want any wrangling. Lee was permitted to be heard and made a rambling sort of a statement, in which lie said that he had taken some liquor and didn't know what he was saying at the time. After which he was told to'be more careful in the future, and to keep a better guard over his actions and tongue. Second Day. Among the strangers in attendance Tues day morning when court opened was Mrs. Parks, wife of the murdered man, who was accompanied by her daughter, aged about 12 years. She was dressed in deep mourning, and her face bore the impression of much suffering. A handsome little blonde of per haps It), came and took a seat inside the railing, having in charge Peie Weast's little "Mascott, a pretty black-eyed little girl of four or five, whom Pete fondled and car sed apparently with much paternal aflec tion. There was John rornof, of the Streator tree I'rts.i, with his sharp, (lean shaven face and pointed nose, noting the proceedings; Kd. Nattinger, of the Timet, Bat at the leporter's table with the dignity of a judge on the bench, and when he went out betimes to Mitch's or Wash H luies', he would call Sumner Cullen or Dan Trainer to take notes for him; there was the intellec tual Teuton of the Herold, Zwanzig, who never wore a necktie, and whose blonde, frowsy hair stood out from his head in all directions as though he had just got up; Beemus Armstrong, doing reportorial work for the Streator 7'tmet, was there in all his glory, the nestor of Ottawa newspaper repre sentatives; McCabe, of the Journal, spent two or three hours each day, went to his loft and let loose his imagination, which fre quently ran riot amid the facts in the case. The Republican, Globe and Wochmhlatt were absent, but a second hand account of the case, furnished them from the other papers by means of the shears, satisfied these enter prising fellows. By the time for adjourning court Tuesday evening twelve jurors were secured, whose names are as follows : Sam uel Patterson, Vet million, farmer; August Bruell, Jr., Earl, farmer ; Geo. Westgate, Ophir, farmer; Geo. Flory, Wallace, farmer; Geo. S. Signor, Earl, stockman ; Nelson Davis, Dayton, carpenter ; T. J. Moore, Fall River, farmer; Dan. C. O'Kane, Ottawa, clerk : Peter Bernard, Ottawa, glass worker; David Wylie, Ophir, farmer; D. 11. Knight, Adams, farmer, and Michael McCaulcy, Grovcland, carpenter. This body was care fully selected by Me srs. Moloney and Bull for their respective sides of the case. It is not composed of any saloon keepers and only in a few instances are there any church members. They are an Intelligent looking body of men and fully realize tlie peculiar and responsible position in which they are placed one which they will never be likely to forget for into their hands is entrusted the life of a human being charged with one of the highest crimes known to the laws. Third Day Promptly at 9 o'clock the sheriff's gavel restored order in the court room and the third day of the murder trial was com menced. Wenst, the defendant, was brought in handcuffed by two stout strapping depu ties, and though the law pronounces him innocent until he is proven guilty, yet it permits a person to be frequently treated aud made a public exhibition of as though he were a condemned criminal. Mr. Bull called the attention of ihe sheriff to this fact and a wordy altercation ensued. It was noted, however, that when the prisoner was returned to the jail for his dinner that the handcuff's were not used. The opening statement was made by Mr. Mulouey on the part of the prosecution and occupied about an hour's time. He outlined the facts in connection with th" shooting as he under stood them, and paiuted the character ot tlie defendant Weast in very black color. It would be shown, he said, that it was a de liberate murder and appealed to the jury to not permit themselves to be swayed by Mr. Duncan's eloquence. After the conclusion of Moloney's opening statement the jury retired, and Mr. Bull arose and stated that he desired to matte a motion to the effect that Luther Latlin Mills, who had been engaged by the prosecution an 1 who was preseut in court to assist the prosecuting attorney, be excluded from so doing. He cited numerous authorities, and after reading copiously from law books the court cut him off by staling that he believed the counsel for the prosecution were abun dantly able to proceed with the trial. He had no recollection of such a point being ever belore raised during his practice at the bar. That, as Mr. Mills was not present vhin tha iurv waa euiDanelled. no other counsel would be permitted to come in and take part in the case. In a conversation with a representative of this paper .Mr. Mills said that it was legal to debar him from taking part in the trial. Moloney said that hereafter no counsel would be allowed by him to take part iu any case in whicn ne represented the people. There was consid erable feeling over the exclusion of Mr. Mills, but be did not take it as a ttiscour. tesy, knowing that if he waa permitted to engage iu the case ii could be sent back for a new trial should the defendant be con victed. A. S. Trude. of Chicago, who waa originally retained, was unable te be pres ent on account of sickness, and nr. iiui waa engaged in bis place, but bis coming in o late into the case ruled him out. Senator Duncan then stepped forward ana the case for tbe defease. He Pkt W It hi. nn linn tirir In turv IV "' .mial forcible and highly eloquent manner, and said to the jury that his understanding of the case was that they should either hang Wnast or let him eo free. He spoke of the i.i'ities of the jury, after which he gave a personal history of the de fendant. Weast, he sail, was born on i farm near Metamora, in Woodford county and was 38 years of ae. His parents were Germans, and came to this country a few vears before he was born. He worked on the farm until he was 16 years of age, and for three years after he worked out as f.irm lahorer. Ho then rented a tarm in Iroquois county. The prosecution said he timu n man of means, such was not the case lie was obliged to spend all that he could scrape together to pay his doctor bills. He lion, i ut Hi'iison a short time. In '70 he rump to Streator and started a restaurant with his brother, which he ran until last, Anril. In the spring of 18--0 he went to California for his health accompanied by his wife. It was through some business tran- u.u-iinn that tin tiecnnin acnuainted Willi Parks. His brother John, who had em barked in business at Benson, in the hopi that the place would some day be a thriving citv. cot into debt, and his sister Barbara applied to Peter Weast for a loan of S'lOO. Did not get it. Applied to Parks, and when tlie note became due he paid it ana neiu i mortgage mi his brother's property at Ben son. On the 4th day of June last Weast started for F.urope. His wife wanted to go to Selby, Ohio, and on June .'5 Parks came to Weast s home and remained all night, l-oin Parks and Mrs. Weast occupied the same room that night. She usually slept in a room down stairs with the children, the hired girl up stairs. That night, however, she or dered tho girl to sleep with the children down stairs. The next day at the depot Parks met Mrs. Weast but did not recognize her. They took the same train for Chicago, with tlie nurse girl and children, and regis tered at the Sherman House. Mrs. Weast sent the children and girl to the parlor, and the door of Mrs. Weast's room was locked, and both Parks and herself remained there for some time. The time of Sells Bros.' cir cus at Streator, some two weeks afterwards, Parks was in Streator and stayed three nights with Mrs. Weast in the upstairs bed- room, the door of which was locked. Dur ing the time of tlie Re-union Paiks attended the theatre with Mrs. Weast. Mr. Duncan said that if he did not establish beyond any question the fact that Parks was a whitened sepulchre of crime, a criminal leper, poluter of homes and of woman's honor, he asked the jury that if might cost Peter Weast his neck. September 'JO Parks wrote a letter to r. U. Marsh signed -r.ninia. which would be produced later on. Once Weast said to Parks: "Every time you come to my houso my wifo acts so queer after you are gone. t wish that you would not come." When Parks wrote to Mrs. Weast lie sent two letters. One was directed to Mrs. Weast and simply said, "I mailed a let ter to day to Miss Nellie ; see that she gets it " The letter referred to the second one was always addressed, "Miss Nellie Moyne." One of the letters addressed to Mrs. Weast was opened by her husband who went to the post office and said to the clerk: "Have you a letter for Miss Nellie I forgot the name?" The clerk at once said, "Is it Nellie Moyne!'' "Yes," said Weast, and by that means he became possessed of tlie clue to this illicit correspondence between her and Parks. The next day after getting this let ter he telegraphed Parks to come to Strea tor, but Parks answered that it was impos sible. Mrs. Weast in the meantime tele graphed Parks to come on and that she would meet him at Beading, a tew miles from Streator. As the rest of Mr. Duncan's opening statement will be learned from the testimony or Mr. .Newell, wno accompanied Parks lo Reading where they were met by Mrs. Weast, it is not necessary to give it here. Mr. Duncan had not finished his statement at the noon hour, and at the open- ing of court at 1:30 P. m. he again took the floor and spoke for an hour. He took occa sion to state that on Sunday morning, the day the soroner's inquest was held, Dr. Minor, who had charge or the case, wenu around the citv to consult with other phy- sicians as to a line of swearing which they should pursue when called to testify before that jury. He handled the Streator doctors without gloves and declared that iticir . - j i i methods oi surgery, as evinenceu vy iucu treatment of Parks was against all known laws of the science. Mr. Duncan's opening speech was replete with masterly invective and scathing and eloquence, and was atten- lively listened to by a crowded court room of spectators. Mr. Mills, who was present, said that it was the finest opening statement he had ever heard. L. M. 

NEWKLL. About 3 o'clock L. M. Newell, of Minonk, was called as the first witness and promptly took the stand. He stated that be was a lawyer and was now nrosecutinir attorney of Woodford coun ty, and a resident of Minonk for the past 20 years. Knew Parks and Weast. Got aquainted with Weast some 15 years ago. Knew Patks 10 years perhaps longer. He lived about a mile and a half from Benson. Was a grain and stock dealers. Have done legal business for him. Saw him Oct. . Parka telegraphed me to go to Heading with him. Left Minonk with him about nooa of that day. When we got to Reading, looked around the "tation to see if there was any one there to meet us. Saw a carriage drive around Blowly, and remarked to Parks that the person we desired to see was in it. I'oming up to the carriage Purks introduced me to Mrs. Weast. Got in after a while, and Parks took the lines and drove lo Streator. W hen we got there Mrs. Weast directed him to the Plumb House. After dinner Reeves, Murdock and Weast came to the hotel. In tlie parlor Reeves proposed that we all go to his oil ts. Varas said lie preierreu io imu sact the business in the hotel, and had en gaged room 43. It was a large room, sepa rated by a double or folding door. I sat on the lounge. Parks sat in one corner, Reeves by the grate and Mrs. Weast sat in another corner of the room. Weast sat in front of the tabling door. 1 told Reeves we were there about the Benson property matter. Parks said that he was willing to deed the property mortgaged to him to any one Mrs. Weast should designate. There was a momentary lull in the conversation after the matter had been settled, and Mr. Reeves made the remark that there was another matter to be settled. There were improper relations existing between Mrs. Weast and Parks, and if tbe latter could explain some circumstances all would be well. Prk said that he would make an explanation if W east would believe him, otherwise it would be useless. Reeves insisted on standing up and 1 requested that he take his seat, which be did. Weast asked Parks if he was at his house Wednesday, and what time he left the house. Parks said about 9. Weast said he did not believe It. Mrs. Weast made the re mark, "I told bim better than that," and said, "You stayed until 11." Wewt asked bim if he went upstairs. Parka denied go ing up. Weast aprang to his feet and drew a revolver, and we all jumped up. Murdock and Reeves got hold of Wesst. I heard him say. 'Til shoot the son of a !" when the .bu was tired. Told Parka to run. lit opeued -the dotw and -started to Ihe right and Pete to the left in the corridor. Called for tlie police. Murdock came down the other stairway; asked him where Parks was. Was told that he was shot. I rushed up and found Parks lying on his back in a comatose condition. While in the cor ridor I heard tlie second seport of a pistol. Parks had no weapon to my knowledge. The blood had spurted on the floor and wall of Ihe corridor and room in a tew places, uo ing out of the room I picked up a bullet ly ing on the carpet, and also tound tue maris of a bullet by the door. I found another bullet under the lounge. (The bullets were here produced by the witness.) Found the mark of a bullet on the back of the lounge. Met Weast in the hallway and asked him what he did that for thought you were making an attempt on me as well as Parks. He said he had none but the most friendly feelings for me. The shooting took place about 3 o'clock p. m. of Oct. 9. Murdook. Reeves, Weast and myself met in the parlor at 9 o'clock that evening. Reeves talked concerning the matter and asked me to go to Parks in regard to the case and en deavor to have the prosecution Stopped. Weast said that he was now satisfied that no improper relations existed between Parks and his wife. Mr, Parks said that it was a serious case, and that he did not feel like having the matter settled ; he was not well, but would talk the matter over in tlie morn ing. Saw him next day and he thought the matter should be fully investigated. On the cross-examination by Bull witness stated that it was Mrs. Weast they expected to meet at Reading. Parks told me so. When we went there I understood that my presence was not desired and withdrew to one side while they (Paiks and Mrs. Weast) conversed about 15 minutes. Got in the rig, a single seated one- horse buggy. The conversation was princi pally about the letter. After an hour and a half iu the box, the first witness was told to step aside. Newell, being recalled by the defense, sta ted that Mrs. Weast said coming up in tlie buggy, "I" think Pete has got that letter." Moloney asked, W hat was said about Hannah Johnson? Mrs. Weast talked a good deal about a girl she called Hannah. Bull here objected, and was sustained by the court. 

WALTER BEEVES. The above witness took the stand at 4:30. He stated that he had been a resident of Streator for the past 10 years. Went with Weast in company with Mr. Murdock to the Plumb House Feb. 9, about 2 in the after noon, met .Mrs. neasi at me entrance. rne said, "Peter, you had better get all the law yers in town." Was introduced to Newell bv Parks at the time. Mrs. Weast asked if there was no room in which they could meet and consult. Offered them the use of my office. Subsequently went up to room 43 in the Plumb House. After we entered the room think 1 remarked, "Well, what are we here for?" addressing inquiry to Mr. Newell. Mr. Newell said thev were present in answer to a telegram from Weast, and were ready to hear what was wanted. I said that there was a business matter between Weast and Parks, and that Weast was on his way to Benson when he was called back. The mat ter concerning the deeding of the property was then spoken of. Newell then stated that there was something else, and called atten tion to the jealousy of Weast against Parks. I stated that Mr. Murdock and myself had nothing to say on that subject. Newell said that they had nothing to say except to enter a general denial of the matter. Murdock, Weast and myself retired for a few minutes conversation, t ame back, and 1 stated that there was acertain matter which if Mr. Parks could satisfactorily explain a settlement would be had. Weast had asked Parks some time before if he had been to see the family lately. Parks said that he had not, but said it in such a manner that Weast felt there was something wrong. The next day he had asked Mrs. Weast if Parks had been there; .Mrs. Weast replied that he had. Parks then said that there was no use in his making a state ment unless Weast believed him. To which W east replied that he would if the truth was . t . .. t . . i. given, t'arks saiu, nnen i met you on iue train I did Dot want to say anything to excite your jealousy.'' (Here Mr. Reeves described the positions of tbe occupants of the room.) Weast arose, and I said, "Sit down, Pete. He did so. He had his hat in his hand. He asked Parks what time he was at his house, and was answered that it was about 8 o'clock or thereabouts. 7.. . , . ,. east asaeu nun now long be stayed, and was told until nine or half past. "Didn't you stay longer?'' Parks said' "Well. I don't know ; I have been al ways kindly treated at your house and have always been asked to remain for meals." . Weast then in a loud tone of voice said, 'Weren't you up stairs with her? 1 ou have taken advantage of my wife," and pulled out his revolver. I caught bun by the wrist; Murdock also caught him, and we command ed him to put up the revolver. We struggled with him and pushed him uaca to tne uuuuie door. All this time he was struggling anu ntterinir "He took advantage of my wile 1 In the course of the struggle he held the re volver in his right hand, which was raised above his head. Cannot tell exactly how ti e shot was fired. After which we let him go. In the hallway I saw Weast, and he raised his arm as though to shoot a second time when he saw Parks. Murdock and l men went to him and pushed him into a room, where we disarmed him. Murdock went to where Parks was lying and turned him over. He was in a fidnlitig condition. A few mo ments later other parties came in, uu r picked up the wounded man and brought him to a window for air. Looking out I saw n- Minor and ca led bim ; he came, ram raised himself up and told us to put the crowd out of the room. There was blood on the wall outside the room and on the carpel. (Judge Blanchard here said that Ihe mem bers of the jury called for reading matter, and ordered the sheriff to be very careful not to furnish them any or the local papers. He said that one of Ihe jurors manifested a desire to read the President's Message, and no doubt was furnished it.) On the re direct examination Mr. Reeves stated that he saw Weast in various parts of the house that evening; saw Weast and his wife and Newell and Murdock in the parlor that evening. They were there when I left. Went to the oflice of the justice of the peace before going borne. "Did any one of the party in the parlor send a message to Tarks that night?" (Bull objected to the question, but the court overruled him.) Did not know of any such message. Yes. Teter Weast went to Parks' room that evening about 10 o'clock. Weal left the parlor and I told him not to go away. He was gone some time. 1 went to Parks ioem. pushed the door open slightly and taw Weast there. By Duncan: "You know that Weast had been sent for on three or four oc casions?" "I only know what was told me. About 8 o'clock went to Weast's house ; f und that k. at the Streator nouse. nm ... ii Was then informed that . i. ... Kiin i p ot ti i Parks had sent a message to veasi. cw Weast and his wife, and they said Parks de sired more time as to what be was going to do about tbe prasecution. There were various messages passing between them as to wither the prosecution would go on or not. " was present as Parks' attorney. Told Newell to aee Parks and get a definite answer.

Told Newell that there was more in the matter than he was aware of. Fourth Day. The concluding portion of Mr. Reeves' testimony, as given above, occupied part of the forenoon ot Thursday. The court room was again densely packed, especially in the afternoon, when there were tully 100 per sons inside the inclosure. Wednesday Weast's little girl, the mascot of the great murder trial, was present with bwr nurse Mie ran about irom seat to seat and was eyed by the curious spectators. She hung around her father s chair most ot the time, climbing into his lap, playing with his heavy gold chain, or, taking his pencil, would mark up papers lying on the desk. Her petite and pretty childish face, with itp bright black eyes, was now turned towards the judge, anon al. tbe jury who held the life of her fattier in tlnir hands, but she did nut understand, and it is to be hoped that she never will. i. u. 

IRONS. Have lived at Benson for the past 8 years. Was in Streator Sunday, October 11. Saw Weast that evening. John Weast was with tne. On going out the entrance to the Plumb House saw him standing near by. Asked him why he shot Parks, and was he drunk or crazy when he did it. He said that if he had taken a second thought he would not have done it for all the world On the cross-examination by Duncan stated that be worked for Parks since Dec 19, 1884. In answer to the question as toj whether or not he was acquainted with Parks' handwriting the witness evidently "smell a mice and would not permit him self to swear positively, although he had seen Parks' handwriting very frequently, asi he admitted. He was disposed of in short metre. int. MINOR The most important witness for the prose cution, Dr. Minor, was now called. Thei taking of his testimony occupied the atten tion ef the court from 10:30 until 2:30. I may be well to preface this expert evidence! by stating that it knocked the reporter: completely out of time, and only at disjoint ed intervals could they "catch on.' iliey however, looked wise and pretended to be) taking it all down. It is not to be wondere at, however, that they were lost in a laby rintliian maze of medical terms fired from! Duncan's battery, which evennonplussed Dr Minor and caused Dr.Lbalafaut to capitulat unconditionally. Dr. Minor took the stand and droppel iuto his seat gracefully, show ing his white teeth,, which he is fond of dis playing. Said his name was U. Alinor. Lived in Streator 11 years. Came there from Eureka, 111. Am a physician and su geaa. Graduated at the University Michigan, June 28. 1883. where he studied three years, and under Dr. Finley twoyears Was assistant demonstrator of anatomy twol years in tho Michigan University. VVa called upou to attend Parks. Found wound a little below the middle of the mid die thread. The ball entered the thigli from the inside. Remained with him alu night. Weast came there about 9 o'clock that evening. He stayed about fifteen mia utes. By Duncan: Saw Weast two or three times that night. Parks died from tbe ef fectsofaeuu shot wound. Was the first physician called. Was not the physician in real charge. Drs. Smith, Head, Slope Boner and C'halfand claimed the responsibil ity with me and were equally responsible They selected me to perturm tne operation Parks said that if there was any cutting tsj be done that I should do it. There has been no controversy to my face regarding th treatment of the case. At the amputation Drs. Smith, Bonar, Chalafant and Taylor! were present. Prepared no questions to beJ submitted to other doctors regarding thel line of testimony to be sworn to before thd coroner s inquest. .May nave tola ur Boaer, and tola him that Dr.Chalfant wanted to see him. but did not know or any arrange ment as to what was to be sworn. Operate on Parks Oct. 18. There was but very lit tie bleeding. Don't know whether it was vein or artery I ligated. Made the ligatior in the middle of the bullet wound. Then were other vessels injured by the bullet alonJ with the femoral artery. (Here a recess o five minutes was taken.) After the first li nation, cleansed the wounu. aiaue anomeu 1 B.l- 1 . . ofw At ,h ,imB . the first ligation made no attempt to ligat the injured vessel. The second opeiatiori w was a continuation ot tue nrst, cutting up ards Drs. Smith and Bonar did not say! that the vessel ligated was a vein, and nod an artery. Dr. Smith, at tne same ugauonj Dlaced his finger on the vessel and said it. was the femoral artery, and that ihere was 4 pulsation. After the operation 1 expressed a doubt that 1 had ligated the femoral ar tery. Don't know whether I tied a vein ot an artery. Will not swear positively wheth er I tied the femoral vein or the femora art (TV. Ou the occasion of the second oper ation I told Dr. Bonar that 1 was afraid tbt cat gut ligature had slipped. Performed thi ti.;..i ni.ruilon Oct. 29. Will not sweai III II v vv 1 that Ihe vessel I ligated at the third opera tion was the same as that ligated at the see ond.
