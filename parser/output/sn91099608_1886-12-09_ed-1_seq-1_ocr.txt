There are hopes that a government land offioe will be established at James town before the winter grows warm, The inoomiDg legislatare will be asked to "appropriato" for an experi mental agrionltnral farm. A long felt want. The Bio ax Falls Argus would be happy with either Day or Ohuroh for governor, but leans over towards the former because the latter is a resident of Dakota for revenue ouly. The estimate for river and harbor appropriations for the ooming year aggregate $30,201,744, of which $1,150, 000 is set apart for the survey of the Missouri river from its mouth to the first territorial boundary line. Persons visiting Huron to attend next week's legislative and constitutional gatherings are adyised that exoursion rates oan be secured over railroads by mentioning destination and objeot of trip to station agents. This anooance meut is made upon authority of the citizens' committee of Huron. This is a good year to belong to the California legislature. The millionaires are in the raoe for the United States senatorship and most of them possess more money than brains. As they are ready to give from their greatest sur plus the situation is of intense interest to the man with'a vote to oast. .. The Ii9toher Blade is of the opinion that the shortest route to north Dakota, via-the valley of the Jim, will not deter legislators for going aroaod by St. Panl on free passes and ooileoting tnileage by that route. We have abetter opinion of legislative honesty than that. The St. Panl sieve will oatoh those only who want to be interviewed. It is the opinion of the Devil's Lake Inter-Ooean that northern legislative representatives will not be solid for E. A. Williams for speaker of the house and that h« will have few followers from central Dakota and none from the south. The Inter-Ooean says the old capital commission crowd wants Williams for speaker and blick Aleck for president of the oounoil, a very good reoBon why they should not be chosen. There is a newspaper op north, we have forgotten itn local habitation and name, which tearfully requests that those members of the state legislature who are also members of the territorial legislatnre and who are present at next week's meeting of the state legislature be tried for treason and hong at the yard's arm. Whether it ia for being a member of the territorial legislatare or of the state legislatare the prayer of the petitioner does not specify. A oiroular from Agastine Davis, presi dent of the Dakota press association, oontains an invitation to attend a reoep tion by the oitizens of Haron, to be given in Huron daring the legislative and constitutional gathering next week., This reception takes ic representatives of the press, members of the constitu tional convention and legislature, United States senators and state officers, and preparations have been made to accommodate a thousand people- This will be the social side of the affair. The Letcher Blade is in-favpr of doing something at the Haron gathering of next week. It says: Aotive inflaenoes are at work to seoore the admission of the whole territory as one state, or at least to defeat division and the admissioa of the south half. The administration and the national democracy are in sympathy with this idea and the dirisionists oannot be too prompt or too aotive in their counter efforts. The constitutional convention ,and its agencies would seem,to be the most natural and effioieqt machinery with whioh to accomplish this purpose. The question is, how will they do it The south gives strong symptoms of combining upon two southern members for president of the legislative oounoil and speaker of the house. It is remem bered that in the republican oonvention the soatb exeoated 2he graceful aot of oonoiliation and good will io giving to -the defeated north the chairmanship of the territorial oommittee and the man agement of the congressional osmp&ign and that in return eighteen thousand northern republicans voted the demo cratic tioket. The sooth therefore in olines toward a selfish use of iis nu merical strength in the legislative body, On Tuesday l&st Delegate "Clifford Introdooed a bill giving national permission for the construction oi railroad bridge aoross the Missouri river at Yankton, or within five miles of Yankton, the- limit taking in what is known as the npper orossing, where the ohalK stone bloffs run down to flf -"^~^',i «^.t^2»r --v* "»fv^ The president's message is produoing a sectional division at Washington. As a correspondent puts it: The east is satisfied on the recom mendation effeoting Soasoes and oon deqin those upon the tariff, while in the west it is the reverse of the order.. It is strange bat trae that soaroely a demo crat or republican oan be found but who will point out some serious obieo tion in the message. This is explained by the democrats who say there is a division in the party on the two issues, tariff and finances, while there are other obstinate contentions in the party over civil servioe reform. Congressman Watson, of Indians, ohairman of the pensions committee, announces in an interview that in the light of the president's message tariff reform is much more argent than pen sion legislation. Pablic opinion takes no new stand in Washington. The friends of the president eommend the message and those not his friends oon demn it. No political line is drawn .be tween favor and disfavor.

MESSAGE. Comments ot the A'ew Yorli Press Upon the Presidential Document. New York, Deo. 7—At the end ot a long.review of the president's message the Times says: *'Ofi the whole the mes sage is one to whioh hardly an exqept tion can fairly be taken, being unpreten tious, patriotic, straightforward and business like." The World says: "Hound as most of the president's suggestions are, it is to be regretted that his making of them is likely to have so little effeot upon oon gress. When Speaker Carlisle can say that he was not consulted in regard to the message and knew nothing whatever in advanoe concerning its recommen dations and similar ignoranoe was felt by other demooratio leaders in congress, the same unfortunate state of affairs that prevented aotion at the laBt session is seen to 'be still extant. It is unfortunate that President Cleveland has not seen fit to plaoe himself in confidential and mutually belpfal relations with the leaders of bis party in congress or with other exponents of demooratio sentiment. It is only by the active oo-operation of its loadors that party gorsrnsaeat ssa ija made suooesBfol. And when the presi dent does not seek, but rather repels, sooh cfo-operation, there is little hope of harmonious aotioo by the two depart ments of the government.. To drop perfunctorily personal messages on the desks of members, us newspapers might be laid there, Is mi the manner in which early presidents i. cognized the leadership ot the pun\ il their re sponsibilities for the pruuiiuiou of its prinoiplee." The Tribune says: "In troth it is not precisely a great message, nor does it sbed muoh light on events. Bat, in the main, it fairly sets forth the opinions aud illustrates the qualifications of the party which eleoted Mr. Cleveland for president." It is difficult to say what the Sun thinks of the message, as the following is the nearest approach to an opinion expressed: "In method and Bpirit, and especially in itB careful study of depart ment reports, on whioh it is largely based, Mr. Cleveland's seoond general message resembles the one sent to con gress a year ago." The Herald says: '"It is a good mes sage clear, plain, not too long, and "the faots it sets forth are suoh as may make every Amerioan justly proud of bis oountry and happy that he belongs to it. If the gentlemen in oocgress will agree together to oarry oat Cleveland'fi recommendations and suggestions they will do themselves oredit and will stand better with their constituents and this ooantry than many of them dp now."

The apparatos consists of a steel rod, whioh is placed opon the oook in the neighborhood of which the leak is suspected, end a microphone attached to the upper end of the rod. A dry battery and a telephone complete the equipment. No soaiid is heard in the telephone if the cooks are closed and ho leak oooors bat a leak of even a tew drops causes sufficient vibration in the pipe to affect the microphone and give aodible sounds in the telephone. At the recent meeting of gas and water engineers in Eisenach it was stated tbat the apparatos is so simple to handle that, with a little iraotioe ordinary workmen are able to eteot and looalize any leak, An Instructive Cine, water's edge.
