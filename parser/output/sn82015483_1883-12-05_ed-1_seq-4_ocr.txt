THE 

NAVY, Tbe Secretary of the Navy repsrts that. un4er the autnonty or tne acta or Augusi o. iwsa, ana uirca o. 1883. the work of strenstheninff our new by the con struction of modern vessels hia bean aupiciously be- son. Three croisers are in nrooese or construction, the Chicago of 600 tons displacement, and the Bos ton and Atlanta, each of a.6 tone. They are to be built of steel with the tensile strength and ductility prescribed by law. and in combination of speed, en durance and armament are expected to compare fa vorably with the beat nnarmored war vessels of other nations. A fourth vasel. tne uoipnin, utotwoi struct d of similar material and is intended to serve as a fleet dispatch boat. Tbe double-turreted monitors Puritan, Amphltiite and Terror have been launched en the Delaware river acd a contract has been made for the suDply of their machinery. A similar moni tor, tue monad uock, nas been isuncnea in uaurorei. The naval advisory board and the Secretary recom mend tne completion or tue monitors, tne construc tion of fonr gunboats and also of three additional ateel vessels like the Chicago, Boston and Dolphin, as an Important mearare of material defense. 1 he Sec retary urges also tbe immediate erection of an inte rior coast line cf water ways a roes tbe peninsula of Florida, along the ooast from Florida to Hampton Roads, between the Chesapeake bay and the Delaware river and through Cape Cod. I feel bound to Impress unon the attention of congress tne necessity ox con tinned progress in the reconstruction of the navy. The condition oi tne public treasury, as i nave al ready Intimated, makes the present auspicious time for putting this branch of the service in a state t f eslciDcy. It is no part of our policy to create and maintain a navy able to cope with the other great cowers cf tbe world, v. e nave no wisu for f oreiizn conquest and the peace which we have long enjoyed is in no seeming danger of interruption; but that our naval strength should be made adequate for the de fense of our harbors, the protection cf our commer cial interests and the maintenance of our national honor 11 a proposition from which co patriotic citi zen can withhold his assent. 

OTHEB DEPARTMENTS. The report of tbe Postmaster General conUins a gratifying exhibit of the condition and proeprcta of this Interesting branch of the public service commit ted to his care. It appears that ou June 30, 1833, the whole number of p.-atoffices was 47, 63, of which were eetaviisoea durins tne previous fiscal year. The number of cffic?s operating under the system of free delivery was 154. At the latter ofncei the pos tage on local matter amounted to $1,195,330.52, a aunt exceeding by $1,021,894.01 the entire cost of the car rier service of the country. The rate of postage on drop letters passing through these offices is now fixed by law at 2 cents par naif oune or fraction tnereor. in offices wnere tue carrier system nas not been es tabHahed the rate is only half as lira. It will be re membered that in 1863, when free delivery was first established by law, the uniform single rate postage upon local letters was one cent, and so it continued until 1872, when in those cities where carrier service was established it was increased In order to defray the expense or sucn service, it seems to me tnat tne old rate may now with propriety be restored, and that, too, even at the risk of diminish! g, for a time at least, the receipts from postage on local letters. I can eee now no reason wnat particular claaa cf mail mat ter should be held accountable for the entire cost of not only its own collection and delivery, bnt the col lection and delivery of all other classes, and I am confident, after full consideration of the subject, that the reduction of the rate would be followed by such a growing acc ssion of buaiutss aa to occasion but slight and temporary loss to the revenue of the post office. The Postmaster General devotes much of his report to tne consideration in tue various apecta of tbe re lations of the government to the telegraph. 6uch re flection ai 1 have been able to give to the subject since my last annual message has not led me to change the view which I there expressed, in dissent- ing irom ine recommenaations or ine tuen osints ter General tl at the c rernmex. t assume the same con trol over tbe twlegraph which it lias al-aya exercised over the malL Admitting that its authority in the premises is as amp e as nas ever been claimed for it. it would not, in my judgment, be 'a wise use of that authority to purcnase or astume tne control of exist ing telegraph lines or to construct others with a view 01 entering int.? general competition witn private en terprise. The objections wbich may be justly urged against either of these projects, and. indeed, aealnst aiiy ajetexn which would require an enormoas in crease in tne civil service list ao net, nowever, apply to some of the plana which hve latoly provoked pub lic comment and discussion. It has beo claimed for example, that Congress might wisely authorize the PvBmaster General to contract with some private person or corporation 1 or tue transmission of mes sages at specific rateB and under government super vision. Various such schemes of the saxe general nature, but widely differing In thMr special charac teristics, nave neen suggestea in tne public prints. ana 1110 arguments oy wnicu tney nave been support ed and opposed have doubtless attracted yeur atten tion. It is likely that the whole subject will be con sidered by jon at the present session. Ia the nature of things it involves so many questions of detail that your aenoerauots wonia probably aa only aided slightly, if stall, by any particular suggestions which 1 migiit now submit 1 avow my belief, however. that the government should be authorized by law to exercise some sort 01 supervision over lnter-iStata tel egrapu communication, and I express the ncpe that for attaining that end aomi measure may be devised wnicu iu receive your approbation. The Attorney General criticises in his' report tbe provisions of existing law, fixing the fees of jrors and witnecBes in the federal court?. These pi o vis ions are cnieny contained in tue act or .February 2. 185-, though some of them were introduced Into that act from statutes wliicn liad been pas?d many years previous. It is manifest that such coinpensat-on as migut wnen mes-a laws were enacted nave been 3 ret and reasonable would, in many instances, be justly regarded at the present day as inadequate. I concnr with the Attorney General lu thebellef.lhat the stat ute should be revised by w! ich thrs fees are regu lated. So, too, f hould the lavs which regulate the compensation 01 a strict attorneys and marshals. Tbey should be paid wholly by salar es, instead of in part by fees, ai is now the case. The change would prove to he a measure of economy, and would dis courage the Institution of needless and oppressive legal proceediDei which, it ia to be feared, have in some instances been conducted for the mere sake of personal gain. Much interesting and varied information la con talned in the report of the Secretary of the Iotwior. I particularly call your attention to his presentation 01 certain pnases ox tae inaian question, to nis rec ommendations for the repeal of the pre-emption and timber culture acts and for more stringent legislation to prevent frauds under the pension laws. The stat utes which prescribe tbe definitions and punish ments of crimes relating to r e tiaionB ooald doubtless be made more effective by certain amendments and additions which are pointed out lu the secretary's rep art. I have previously referred to tbe a arming state of illiteracy In certain portions of the country. and aaain submit for tbe consideration of Congrats wnetner some ieaerai aia saouta oe extended to ou lie primary education wherever adequate provision tnereior nas not aireauy oeen maae 

POITGAMY. The Utah commission has submitted to the Secre tary of tbe Interior its second an ual report. Asa result of its labors In euperrising the recent election in mat taritory pursuant to tne act of March 22, '89, it appears that tbe persons by that ait dlsauallfied to the number of about 12,000 were excluded from the polls. This fact, heweve-, affords little canee for con gratulation, and I fear that it is far from indicating n j reai ana suosiamiai progress toward tne extirpa tion of polygamy. A1 of the members of the leslala- ttire are Mormons There is grave reason to be lie re that they are In sympathy with the practices tlat this government is seeking to suppress and that its effort in that regard will be more likely to encounter their opposition than receive tbeir encourag-ment sjj suor . r,voQ h m:i view enou;a nappny ce er roneous, the law under which the commissioners have been acting should be made more effective by the incorporation of some such stringent measures as they recommend, as were included ia bill No. 2,228 on the calendar of the Senate at .ts last session. I am convinced, however, that polygamy has become to strongly intrenched in the teirltoiy of Utah that it !s profitless to attack it with any but the stoutest weap ons wbich constitutional legislation can fashion. I favor, therefore, the repeal of the act npon which tbe existing government depecds, the assumption by ths rational legislature of the entire political control of the territory, and the establishment cf a commission with suoh powers and duties as shall be delegated to it by law. AG&ICUX.TUR1L. The department of agriculture is accompli fhing much In the direction of tbe agricultural develop ment of the country, and the report of the commis sioner, giving tbe rtsults of his investigations and experiments, will be found interesting and valuable. At his instance a convention of thoae interested in the cattle industry of tbe country waa lately hsld at Chi cago. The prevalence of the pleuro-pneumonia and other contagious diseases of animals was one of the chief topics of discussion. A committee of the con vention will invite your co-operation in investigating the eames of these diseases, and providing metnoda for their prevention and cure. LAWLESS ALASKA. I trust that Cobgresa will not fail at Its present ses sion to put Alaska und&r the protection of law. Its people have repeatedly remonstrated against our neg lect to afford them the maintenance and protection expressly guaranteed by the terms of the treaty whereby tbeir territory waa ceded to the United States. For sixteen ears tbey have pleaded in vain for what they should have received without the ask ing. Tbey have so law for the collection of debt, tbe support of education, the conveyance of proper ty, tbe administration of estates, the enforcement of contracts; none. Indeed, for the punishment of crim inals, except each as offend gainst certain customs, oommerce and navigation act. The resources of Alaska, especially in fur, mines and lumbr,!ar con siderable in extent and capable of large development, while In its geographical situation It is one ef politi cal and commercial importance. The prominence of interest therefore aa well aa considerations of honor and good faith demand the immediate establishment of civil government la that territory. 

BAIL BO AD TOPICS. Coaoplaiuts have lately been numerous and urgent that certain corporations, controlling in whole or in part the facilities for the inter-State carriage of per sona and merchandise over the great railroads of the country, have resorted in their dealings with the public to divers measures unjust and aggressive in their character. In soma instances the State gov ernments have attacked and suppressed these evils, but In others they have been unable to afford ade quate relief beoaae of the Jurisdictional limitations wbioh are imposed npon them by the federal consti tution. The question of how far the aational gov ernment mav iawfnUy interfere in the premises and what. If any, aupervision and control it ought to ex ercise, ia one which merits your careful considera tion. While we cannot fail to recognise the impor tance of tha vafct railroad system! of the country and their great and beneficial infiuanoea upon the devel opment of our material wealth, we should on the other hand remember that no individual and no cor poration ought to b invested with absolute power over the interest of any other citUsn or olaes of citi zens. The right of these railway corporations to a fair and profitable return npon their Investments and to reasonable freedom in their regulations must be recognized. But it seems only just that far as ita constitutional authority will permit, Congress mould protect the people at large la their inter-btata traffic gaint acts of lnjcstioe which the btate gov ernments are powerless to prevent, m roBsHTS. In my last annual meeaoga I called attention to tha necessity of protection by suitable legislation of tbe forests situated upon public domain. In many por tions cf the West tbe pursuit cf general agriculture is only made practicable by resort to irrigation, while sueoessful irrigation would itself be impossible with out the aid afforded by forests in contributing to tba regularity and constancy of the supply of water. During the past year avere suffering and great loss of property have bean occasioned by profuse floods, followed by periods of unusually low water in many of tbe great reservoirs of the country, a he irregu larities wera In a great measure caused by th removal from about tba sources of the streams in question of tha timber by wbioh tha water supply had been aoniw sMHidpV0wwSt4f XbpifwrrUoiig fucfa por tion of tbe forests of ths national domain as ecsen tiaDy contribute to the equable flow of Important wa f ter courses ia of the highest consequence.

The industrial exhibitions whloh have been held ia the United States during the present year attracted attention in many foreign cou o tries where the n no on cement of these enterprises hed been made pub-. 110 tnr jugn tue ioreign tnnaanoe ox tnis government The industrial a hibitlon at Boston, and tbe southern exposition at Louisville, were largely attended by tba exhibitors of foreign conntrlea, notwithstanding tbe absence of any professional character in those under takings. The centennial exposition to be held next year at New Orleans, in commemoration of the cen tenary of the first shipment of cotton from a port of the United States, bids fair to meet a like m-atlfying success. Under the aat of Congress of the ICth of February, 1881, declaring that exposition to be na tional ana international jn us cnaraoter, axi ioreign governments with which the United States maintain relations have been invited to participate.

I ask for it your careful attention, sspscialiy for thoae portions which relate to assess men ts, arrears of taxes and water mpply- THE 

CIVIL 8KB VICE. The commissioners who were appointed under the act of January iff, 1883, entitled "An act to regulate ana improve tne civu service ox tne unitea states," entered promptly upon the discharge of these duties. A series of rules framed in accordance with the spirit of tbe statute was approved and promulgated -by the President. In some particulars wherein they seemed defective tnese raise were subsequently amenaea. It will be perceived that they discountenance any political or religious testa for admission to those of fices of the public service to which the statute re lates. The act ia limited in its original application to classified clerkships in the several executive de partments at Washington (numbering about 5. 600) and to similar positions in custsma districts ana poet omoea wherein as many aa fifty persona are employ ed. A olaaiiiication of these positions analogous to that existing in the Washington office waa duly made before the law went into effect. Eleven customs districts and twenty-three poatofficas were thus brought under tne immediate operation ox tne statute. Ths annual report of the civil service commission, which will soon be submitted to Con gress, will dbubtlees afford tbe means of a more de finite judgment than I am now prepared to express aa to the merits of ths new system. I am persuaded that ita effects have thus far proved beneficial. Its practical methods appear to be adequate for the end p reposed, and there have been no serious difficulties in oerryirg them into effect. Since the I6tn of July 1ft st no person, so far aa I am aware, has been ap pointed to the public service, in the classified por tions thereof at any of the d apartments, or at any of the postoffioea and customs districts above named, except those certified bv tbe commission to be the most competent on the basis of the examination held in com ormity to the rules at the time. THE 

PKESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION. When the present executive entered upon his office. his death, removal, resignation, or inability to dis charge his duties would have left the government without a constitutional head. It ia possible, of course, that a similar contingency may again arise unless the wisdom of Congress shall provide against its recurrence. The Senate at its last session, after full consideration, passed an act relating to this sub ject which will cow, I trust, commend Itself to tbe approval of both Houees of Congreea The clause of tne constitution up m which must depend any law regulating the Presidential succession presents also for solution other questions of paramount impor tance. The questions relate to the properjlnterpreta tion of the phrase "inability to discbarge the powers and duties of said office," our organic law providing that when tbe President shall suffer from suoh iua- bi'ity the Presidential effioe shall devolve, etc. I need not hare set forth the numerous and inter esting inquliies which sre suggested by these words of the constitution. They were fully stated iu my first communication to Congress and have since been the subject of frequent deliberations ia the body. It Is greatly to be hoped that these momentous ques tions wm nnd speedy solution, lest emergencies may arise when further delay will be impossible and any determine ion. albeit the wisest, may furnish cause for anxiety and alarm. For the reasons ful'y stated in my last annual mes sage I repeat my recommendation that Congress pro pose an amendment to tbat prevision or tne constitu tion which prescribed the formalities for the enact ment, whereby in respect to bil'a for the appropria tion of public moneys the executive may be enabled, while giving bis approval to particular items, to in terpose his veto onsuch others aa do not commend tnemseives to nis judgment. THE 

CIVIL BIGHTS DECISION. The fourteenth amendment of the constitution confers the right of citizenship upon all persons born or naturalized in the United SUtesand subject to the jurisdiction thereof. It was the special purpose of this amendment to insure to all of the colored race the full enjoyment of civil and political rights. Cer tain statutory provisions intended to secure the en forcement of thsee rights have been recently declar ed unconstitutional by the Supreme court. Aay legis at ion whereby Congress may lawfully supple ment the guarantees whloh the constitution affords for the equal enjoyment by all the citizens of the u nitea states ox every right, privilege and immunity of citizenship, will rec ive my unhesitating appro val.
