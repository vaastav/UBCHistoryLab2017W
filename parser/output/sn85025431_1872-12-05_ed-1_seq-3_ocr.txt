THE TRANSCRIPT A. A. HARW80D. Editor and Proprietor. -AUSTIN. MINN- THURSDAY MORNING, DEC. 5,1878. PrMl4«Ri'i Sfensmgc. We havo no time now to synorticate this document. It is straisrht-lorward, manly,and statesmanlike firm, patriot­ ic, and wise, and commends itfcli to the judumcut and good conscionee of all citizens. We shall be able hereafter to present some of its more important fea­ tures. THE last session of the 42d Congress began on Monday. Tho President message, together with the report* of the heads of Departments, was received in tho Senate. Several bills were introduced, and a resolution upon the death of Horace Greeley was consider­ ed. In tho House, several new members were sworn in Mr. Hanks tendered resignation of the Chairmanship of ths Committee of Foreign Affairs, but it was not accepted. Speaker Blaiue tailed Mr. Cox, of New York, to the Chair, sad offered a resolutioo demand­ ing an investigation of the Oakes Ames Credit Mobilier charges. Mr. Cox then eulogised the life and services of Hor­ ace Greeley, after,which the President's Message was read and the House ad­ journed. Horace Greeley. The public mind has been, in soaie degree, prepared for the announcement of the death of this eminent man. Ilis very sudden and acute illness mentioned a week ago, was quite generally accept­ ed as a rarning that it wculd prove fa­ tal. lit' is dead: aud thus ends iu a tragedy, what begun as a farce—the campaign of 1872 M. Greeley was ic one sense a great man. Intellectually, he had few equals and no superiors. We do not mean by this, that he possessed as much accu­ rate scholarshipas some men nor that he had that power by which the deep and hidden mysteries of nature are solved and utilised for the benefit of mankind. His mind was of a different type. His capability to analyze was most wonder­ ful, and elosely allied to it was his pow­ er of critieism. In critical analysis, -whether of the character of men, or of the nature of events, he stood without peer. His career as a journalist, running through a period of more than thirty years, abundantly corroborates this as­ sertion. Surrounded, as he always was, by the greatest men in America, he -was never of them, the least conspicu­ ous. He lather moved like a God among the monuments of human am­ bition, leveling their crests, strengthen­ ing their bases, and shading eaeh down into harmony -with the great mass of mankind, making them to subsorve the interests and to promote the reforms necessary, in a great republic, without, at the same time, usurping the only prerogative of the people—the right of self-government. Not especially original—having but little of the creative, Mr. Greeley sig­ nalized himself by a masterly discuss­ ion of the opinions of others. His great controversial powers, and his am­ ple opportunity for their use, have led liim to an extreme in their manifesta­ tion. This will to some extent account for the lack of mental balance which has frequently characterized him,up­ on occasions of great national signifi­ cance. This peculiarity grew upon him as domestic sorrows accumulated, aud the infirmities of age increased, until he became unconsciously its victim. It was at this period in hi* life, that he became*a candidate for the Presidency. Not a year sooner would his own judg­ ment have permitted him to accept a position so diametrically opposed to all that he had previously advocated. The fate of Webster, and of Clay was for­ gotten he plucked upon himself the malady—which to them proved so fa­ tal—iu the insane belief, that it would effect in him, a complete rejuvenation. Vaiu hope. The crisis which proved it, was succeeded by a moment of sani­ ty, in which In cried out, The coun­ try is gone, the Tribune is gone, and I am gone." This was consciousness re­ asserting its sway, for the moment, only to be dethroned forever. It helps to prove also, that Mr. Greeley's iniud was a grand duality. Each qual­ ity was a pair of extremes: a host in himself, no man was moro susceptible to influences than he: of a tempera­ ment naturally devotional, he was, nev­ ertheless, frequently profane posses­ sed of great kindness of heart, he was sometimes terribly censorious and cru­ el having a lively sympathy with the suffering and the needy .he presents the anomaly of permitting one of his own kindred to go down to the grave, de­ pendent upon the cold charity of stran­ gers. He was a paradox in everything, and yet, more paradoxical than all, himself waa his only complete illustra­ tion. As a study for mankind, his life is most valuable. As a model, it is chiefly valuable for its great indus­ try, and the effect of this, even, is some­ what modified by his many and strange eccentricities. His career must be sha­ ded down from its wide extremes,and im­ pressions be taken from the golden mean which meanders the current of bis tor­ tuous experience.

WILLIAMS' SNTZBS STOCK OF GSOCS&nSS BURNED. Bu. J. E. *pars Office Ton Down to frcrat tie Fire Ira Streallm. A TOTAL LOSS OF S2SOO The Family «f Mr. Williams Resided over the Store. At one o'clock yesterday morning, Mrs. Braden Lincoln, a watcher with Mrs. Williams, who was sick, underta­ king to go below, fell and broke a lamp filled with kerosene. The flames imme­ diately enveloped her and ignited the combustibles with which the building was filled. Mr. Williams rushed below to save Mrs. Lincoln, but his efforts were in vain—she perished in ihe flimes and her body was almost entirely con­ sumed, Not until he was terribly burned,did Mr. Williams relinquish the hope of saving Mrs L. He escaped through a window, and naked—except his night apparel—and literally roasted from his feel to his thighs, leaving the soles of his feet npon the frozen ground, he be­ gan to prepare for the escape of his family. No ladder being at hand, dry goods boxes were piled in front of the store, and the sick and helpless—one being an infant only twenty hours old— were passed down over them. Mrs. Williams maintained a remark­ able tranquility, and strange to say is comparative comfortable. While it is hoped that Mr* Williams will survive, it is by DO means certain that he will not soon yield to the overpowering in­ fluence of his fearful injuries, and in any event, he will be hopelessly crip­ pled, and sadly disfigured, Mrs. Lin­ coln was about forty years of age, and leaves a husband who is nearly frantic over the terrible calamity. The oitisens rendered every possible as­ sistance and performed prodigies. About $500, belonging to the P. 0., and a box of stamps being accessible, were saved. 11 r. Williams has lost everything. No mem­ ber of the tail having sufficient clothing left to cover nakedness. His tttal loss it not less than $2,500. The sympathies of the people are fully aroused. His neighbors hare alreadv raised $375, and Austin will contribute most liberally. Mr. Williams being clerk of the Sohool Dis­ trict, had the record* in his office, and they were consumed. The Are was kept from spreading only by tearing down the office of the lion. John IT. Wyckoff. This was effected through efficient action of the railroad men at the station, who were provided with long ropes and iron hooks. With these thebuilding.was speedily demol­ ished and removed.. All his books, records, papers and other valuables were saved. The Coleman store took fire several times, but by hereto efforts was sav*d. The calamity is a horrible one, and appeals to the benevolent impulses of every eitisea of the eounfy. Mr. Williams is very widely known and universally esteemed. Mrs. Lincoln was an amiablt and lovely woman, passionately devo­ ted to her husband. She waa likewise in active sympathy with all the sick and n*edy among her acquaintance. The case evokes the liveliest feelings, and easts a gloom over the entire community. Laraa.—Hon. John T. Williams died of his injuries, in great agony, at ft minutes before 10 o'eloek, a. to day The funeral services will take place ea Sabbath next, at 2 o'clock P, M. It is expected that a special train will run from Austin for the accommodation of the many friends who will desire to attend. A FREIGHT Train, from St. Paul, night before last,broke a rail near Med ford, and went-off the track. The Engi­ neer was slightly injured and twelve cars were smashed. Another Freight, from McGregor, fell through a bridge near Chester, and was badly dauiag:d, although no per­ son was injured. The passenger trains from each way were six hours late. TIIK burial of Mr. Greeley yesterday from Dr. Chapin's Church in NewYork, waa the occasiou of one of tho most im­ posing pageants ever witnessed upon this continent.

DKATII IN A THRESHING MACHINE. —On Wednesday morning, the 27th ult.., Jaines Pratt, an old and highly respected citizen of the town of El moro, while at work around a threshing ma chine, aecidontly got his left hand entangled in the gearing in such a man­ ner as to tear off the greater portion of it. Mr. Pratt was a hale and vigorous man. and a fatal result was not antici­ pated. A physician was called who :idtnitiistercd anodynes to allay the pain. The patient,however, sank into a lethar­ gic state as is supposed from nervous rostration, and died about nino o'clock tho evening. Nenraful Death eftheCireat Ed­ itor, Horace Vreelry. NFAV YORK, Nov. 30.—Mr. Greeley i« dead. The mournful news creates a profound sorrow throughout the city mingled with almost a pall at its sud­ denness. There has been so much mys­ tery'and ooncealment regarding the first appearance and progress of his illness that the following complete review of his last daya' illness will be read with the deepest interest: When the Hon. Horace Greeley first learned the precarious condition of his wile's health he was preparing to start on his terrible speech making tour through the New England States. Du ring this absence Mr. Greeley never slept over four hours at a time.— Through the day he would often dose in the car and "catch snatches of sleep, but when awakened, either by the stop of the train or to make a speech, his haggard aad care-worn expression of countenance was always more express' ion of fatigue than any remarks he was ever he-ird to uinke. Meanwhile Mrs. Greeley's health hat! been rapidly declining,and she had re moved from Chappaqua to this city Mr. Johuson, of No. 323 West Fifty seventh street, had placed a suite of rooms at her disposal, and those the in­ valid occupied with her eldest daughter, Miss Ida, while Mr. Greeley had reoma in the same house. It was there,while passing sleepless nights at the bedside of his dying wife, that Horace Greeley first began to show signs of great men­ tal depression. Ou one occasion when the opposition press was criticisiug his great Pitts­ burgh speech, he said, If they make the issue that I am the rebel candidate I am bound to be defeated." This consideration seemed to weigh on his mind, and often he would clasp his hands to his head and cry out, Oh Oh!" as though suffering from intense pain. He was advised to continue his wood chopping matinees, and though severely chafed by the ac­ counts of them published iu the New York Times, he still pursued his open air exercise. On one occasion,at Chap paqua, he was accompanied by Mr. Johnson and his son. Mr. Johnson,Jr., chopped down the lower limb of a hem­ lock tree, which narrowly missed the fathci's head. What do you mean," cried out Mr. Johnson, Sr., "Do you want to kill me, Willie I wish somebody would kill me," responded Mr. Greeley in a voice of ex­ treme sadness. At length on the morning of Octo­ ber 30th, Mrs. Greeley died. When he was iuformed of his wife's death, he wrung his hands and cried like a child aud said: Oh why did you not let me sit up with her. Why did you send me off to bed My poor wife! my poor wife!" Two daya afterward Mrs. Greoley waa buried. The remains were followed to the grave by a large concourse of people, all of whom 'noticed Mr. Gree­ ley's grief. He returned after the fu­ neral to the residence of Mr. Johnson, and instead of interesting himself about his daughters and the future gave way wholly to dejection. It was then he showed the first positive evidence of mental derangement. It was noticcd about this time that he would tell his private business to every one with whom he came in con­ tact. and to each one he told a different story of his troubles and the infidelity of his supposed friends. He would at times denounce the Democratic party whom he would accuse of coming out for the Administration. Then he would violently criticise the course pursued by the opposition newspapers, aud espe­ cially by the mismanagement of the Tribune, and his fatal mistake in allow­ ing his name to be used as a candidate for the Presidency. Mr. Alvin J. Johnson was hb most intimate friend. One evening while holding his hand Mr. Greeley said to him: "Alvin -Johnson do you know made a terrible mistake about Mr. Da­ na He was right about On to Rich­ mond Yes I am satisfied now that he was right about it." Often after that, when he was unable to sleep, and while his disease was yet in its iocipiency, Mr. Greeley would take Mr. Johnson to his room,and with hands clasped he would impart to hiui the most intimate secrets of his past One morning he said to Mr. Johnson, as the latter was leaving the house, Meet me at the Tribune office at 2 o'eloek this afternoon, I have a private communication to make to you." Mr. Johnson waa there at tbe ap­ pointed hour, but Mr. Greeley declined saying anything, but said Meet me at Sam Sinclair's at six to-night, 1 want to sec you." Mr. Johnson was there at the tirno and found Mr. Greeley asleep. Mr. Sinclair and George Ripley were in an­ other room. Mr. Greeley slept for some time but when he at length awoke his mind seemed gone. Mr. Sinclair be ged him to stay there and go to bed He quietly assented, and then, turning to Mr. Johnson, said Alvin Johnson, take me home with you, won't you!" Mr liipley also begged Mr. John­ son to do so,but although it was early in the evening, it was miduight before they reached 57th street. Some days before that Dr. Edward Rayard, the late Mrs. Greeley's medi­ cal attendant, noticed that Mr. Greeley had a restless, feverish appearanee. He is a hoincepathist, but kiudly prescribed for his old friend, as he correctly ima­ gined Ire needed an anodyne. On re­ turning home the night above mention­ ed, Mr. Johnson mixed one of the pow­ ders and gave it to Mr. Greeley. The latter, in taking it, spilt half'of it over his shirt front, and *.vhen reminded that he had done so, he Baid, Oh, never mind it—it's just as good outside as in." The following morning Mr. Gree­ ley waa more restless and haggard in appearanee than ever. Mr. Johnson sent for his family physician, Dr. Krac kowizer, chief surgeon of the German hospital. Dr. Krackowizer recognized the case as a serions one, and at once resorted to the most energetic treat­ ment. At first it seemed as though the malady woujjl yield to the treatment, and at times the patient became gentle in disposition, perfectly rational and in apparently good health. It was during this period that he wrote his card resu­ ming the editorship of the Tribune, published on Nov. 7. Mr. Greeloy never again visited the Tribune editorial room. To a friend whom he met three days later, he said in a hopeless tone of voice: I do not go to the Tribune office any more. I havo no business thero, but I want a thousand dollars. I must have a thousand dollars, if you can get it for nie*" After a long pause, as if he had sud­ denly forgotten what he wns talking about, he said, 1 am ruined." When bis mind was called to the thousand dollars, Mr. Greeley told his friend that he might leave tho money with the cashier of the Tribune, and it might reach bim, but he did not go to the Tribune office any more. I don't eare for politics, and would not go cn the cars to Washington to be President." What I do feel," con­ tinued Mr. Greeley, is tho loss of tny wife, who has been uiy companion for nearly forty years. 1 have watched by her bedside night and day, and now I am completely prostrated from anxiety and want of sleep, but am obliged to come back to the Tribune, where my services are needed After conversing further with Mr. Greeley, who promised to dine with his visitor at his home, Col. Allen took his leave and has mt seen him since. The Sun reporter asked the Colonel whether the vile rumors that Mr. Gree­ ley l.ad spent most of his money on the election were true. The Colonel scout­ ed the idea as preposterous. On the 13th of November, RufusT. Andrews was requested to meet Gree­ ley at the house of a mutual friend,aud wan shocked to find Mr. Greeley so changed and bearing evident symptoms of iiisauity. The uiedieal treatment Mr. Greeley was receiving proved inef­ fectual. Medicine becamo of no avail, and reason gave way. On Nov. 20th Dr. Rrown, superin­ tendent of the Klo'tmingdale Asylum, and Dr. Geo. C. CItoat*, proprietor of a private asylum in Westchester coun­ ty, were called to meet Dr. Krocker for consultation. A careful examina­ tion of the patieut waa made and they unanimously pronounced him suffering from acute mania, and entirely insane. The ahock was a severe one to the friends who were intrusted with the se­ cret but after due deliberation they became sufficiently rcconc.lcd to the fact to consent to remove Mr. Greeley to Dr. Choate's residence, near Pleas antville, Wcstehcster county. The house is pleasantly situated about one mile and a half from the town, on a hill half a mile from a road to the near­ est house It is comfortably furnished, has handsome grounds surrounding,and though known to the neighbors as a private lunatic asylum, it has the ap­ pearance of the cuuntry seat of some wealthy gentleman,and there Mr. Gree­ ley was conveyed last Thursday week. When he was brought down stairs in Mr. Johnson's house, in front of which Mr. Stewart was waiting with a close carriage. Mr. Johnson handed him his traditional white hat aud coat. It was deemed best that Mr. Greeley should remaiu over uight at the resi­ dence of Mr. John R. Stewart,of Tar r«lown. Mr. Greeley seemed to know that he was on the way to an asylum. At first ic told Mr. Stewart that he would not leave his house. It was only after Mr. and Mrs. Stewart promised to call and see him every day that he consented to go. Before leaving Mr Stewart's res­ idence he walked through the grounds. Suddenly stopping and gazing intently at two small shrubs, he said We must put the cedar in the ground, for it will freeze hard before Tuesday." Mr. Stewart became alarmed and then endeavored to. place hiui iti a close age for removal to Dr. Choate's residence. Mr. Greeley cried bitterly, and for a long time refused to go. He repeatedly said to Mr Stewart: Dou't let tbem take me away. I want to stay here with you." It was only when urged by Auntie Lawson aud Mrs. Stewart that he con­ sented to go with Mr. Stewart in the carriage. The day after his arrival at Dr. Choate's, the disease de/eloped it­ self hourly in all its intensity. The horrors of acute mania wero hourly witnessed, and he was violent in his ac­ tion. The most skillful treatment at the hands of experienced physicians proved of no avail and the patient grad ually sank into a state of unconscious­ ness. The inflammation af the brain made the stouiach sympathise with it to such an extent that Mr. Greeley refused and was really unable to take food in any form. He gradually became worse and failed to recognize his own relatives and tbe few intimate friends who visit­ ed him. At one time he tore the watch, presented to him by,the employees of tbe Tribune, apart, and again he threw a kerosene lamp on the floor, setting tbe floor on fire, and narrowly escaping being burnt to death. As his strength left hiin he becamc more quiet but did uot show any signx of consciousness until about an hour before bis doath. Mr. Greeley passed a very restless night Thursday—he raved -incoherently all night, threw bia arms wildly about, and rolled aud tossed about from one side of the bed to the other. At eight a.m. yesterday he remained unconscious, his extremities gradually became cold and he waa motionless in his bed* Dr. Cboate, Miss Ida Greeley, Mr*. John R.Stew art and Aunty Lawson were in constant at­ tendance, but Ur. Greeley did not recognise them. During tbe afternoon he appeared to be praying. Onoc he said in a loud,strong voice: I know that my redeemor lirctlr" An hour later he repeated several times, I died before I was born," and at precisely four o'eloek he alarmed those about bim by saying in his nat­ ural voice: "IT is 

DOME." Those were Itis last words. He then agaiu relapsed into a state of unconsciousness. His respiration be­ came weaker, his extremities colder, and bis face bore the unmistakable imprint of death, and he was pulseless at the wriat, and thus re­ mained until six p. in. The room in which Mr. Greeley died wns a large one on the northwest corner of tbe first floor of Dr. Choate's house.. It was a bright one. neatly carpeted, but devoid of chairs or pictures, ornaments, wash-basin, or any small articles of furniture. All these had been re­ moved when Mr. Greeley first manifested evi­ dences of violence. Bi fore they wer» remov­ ed,however,he on one occasion broke his watch to piecos, and at another time threw a kero­ sene lamp on the floor. The burning oil ig­ nited the carpet, and had it uot been that an alarm was immeuiately given, the house might have been destroyed by fire. The disease first developed itself violently two weeks ago to-niabt, at a meeting of tbe trustees of the Tiibune, held at the residence of Mr. Samuel Sinclair. The next day Dr. Krackowiser was called in by Alvin J. John­ son. Then came the consultation and the unanimous vcrdictof the doctors was that acute mania had set in. The seal placed upon Dr. Choate's lips in relation to the aetual con­ dition and treatment of his patient and the development of the disease, deprives history of an important cbapter in the life of Horace Greeley. Nervous exoiteuicnt, disappointed hopes and loss of deep,doubtless produced tho fatal disordsr, while a terrible mental strain, proving too great for his weakened physical system, hastened tho result. His funeral will probably take place on Tuesday from Dr. Cha­ pin's church. OBSCENE PUBLIOATONS.—We are pleased to note that the polieo authorities of New York eityare taking activesteps for the aupprcssion of obscene and oth­ er disreputable publications in that city. During the years of corrupt rule there, this branch of infamy has flourished to a grievous extent. Scores of the vilest miscreants have been engaged in the publications, or sale of obscene books, papers, pictures, ctc., and these abomi­ nable publications are openly advertised in all the sporting papers, and by hun­ dreds of otherwise reputable newspa­ pers in various parts of the country. The postal laws of the country are deemed adequate for the virtual sup­ pression of this heinous occupation,pro iding the postal authorities can have the co-opcration of municipal and State officers. Rut this cannot be accom­ plished without the activo co-opcaation of the press. A simultaneous move­ ment on their part will suppess this in quity in one month's time. TUB Presidential electors of Minneso­ ta, met at the Capitol yesterday and cast their votes for U. S. Grant. HtMf Newt. The Patrons of Husbandry have or­ ganized a new Grange in Faribault. The St. Cloud city council has de cided to purchase a first-class hand fire engine. Tho first city officers of tho now city of Rraincrd are to be electcd Dec. 23. The Rrainerd Tribune claims that the twenty hotels of that city are full all tho time. Faribault has suffered two disastrous fires duriug the last ten days, and now her citizens are moving energetically for the purchase of a steam fire engine. The Francis Paluis, tho last of the wrecked vessels remaining at Duluth, was floated off Monday, and now liesjin the inner harbor. Her repairs will cost it is thought, about, 88,000. The Fair Association of Rice coun­ ty has been organized by tho olection of J. H. Harding, President, Zenas S. Wilson, Treasurer, and W. R. Raid win, Secretary. An assessment of iivo per ceut. of the capital stock has beou ordered, and preparations for the coming season will be lay. A goodly number of our citizens that are in favor of. suppressing the liquor traffic which is being carried on in the little burg held a temperance meet­ ing a few days since. It was addressed by Mr. A. M. Hutchinson, of Spring Valley, arid, as that old tyrant, King Alcohol, has at last been summoned before a tribunal composed of an iujur cd people, we are in hopes that the grand army of tempcrance and reform will throw thoir banner to the breeze and march forth in such a manner that those who are selling whisky on tbe sly to countlcss numbers of young men,will feel disposed to shut up their shops of pollution, and help to banish all kinds of intoxi:ating beverages from our fair land. So mote it be. Since the Davenport & St. Paul R. R. company's surveyors stuck their grade stakes through this village, busi­ ness iu tbe real estate lino has received anew impetus which has sent lots up from ten cents to two hundred dollars. There ha? been nothing done yet in the way of erecting depots aud wholesale business houses. There is some talk about a large grist mill, but whether it is to be propelled by wind or steam is an unsettled question. Experiments heretofore made have demonstrated the faet the-that the little rivulet which passes through the town does not furnish power enough for such business. A resident of Frankford, by the name of Preston Leathers, died very suddenly during the past week at Charles City, Iowa. His remains were brought home and buried yesterday by the side of those of his relatives who have preceded him to the spirit land. Hon. S. Bostwick, of this place, re ccived a letter a few days ago from Scotland, notifyin him that he had SCO,000 Icgacy there awaiting his order. He has employed one of the Spring Valley attorneys to look after the mat ter for him, and hopes to receive the stamps in a short time. If the report does not prove to be a big sell on the good old man, we shall be glad. r|1 commenced without de O'Neil, who has been in custody for a fortnight on charge of robbing Fa­ ther Coiner, an alleged Catholic Priest, was taken to S.
