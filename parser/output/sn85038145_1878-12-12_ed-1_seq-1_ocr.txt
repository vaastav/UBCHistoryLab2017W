The readers of the Herald will remem ber, that sometime since, I presented my first paper on the "Metric System." I now offer No. 2. The more I consider this great system the more I see that it is a subject magnifi cent in all its parts, and it most surely ranks its advocates among the reformers of men and things. This subject already has an immense history. It is not the -hallucination of a few brainless beings, but born or neces sity and cradled is the cold lap of oppo sition, it has grown a strength, formida ble to all croakers and weak adversaries. Some may say that the system is tainted with objections, because it comes from the world-renowed France. What of that? Do not all know that France and Ger many lead the whole civilized world in education, and especially, in great scien tific discovery, investigation and re search ? Again, others say that such men as Charles Davics, L. L. D., have raised ob jections to the metric system. True, So did the pulpit of the whole Christian world raise a hue and cry against the doctrine of the Xebular Hypothesis, but to-day all are enthusiastic in presenting it as the best possible explanation for the past and present of matter. this law of sub-division has been already abandoned for all values below seconds, such values being expressed decimally. Some engineers of the present day have the verniers of their therdolites divided decimally on account of the great conve nience of the decimal division in laying out railroad curves. An object is offered to this system on account of the unit base being too small; for instance, in naming the distance between Xew York and San Francisco, if expressed in meters, the mind cannot grasp so large a number. Do we name the distance between the cities above-named in yards, the basa of our system? In mechanical engineering, the cente- incr-is the unit; in physics, the millime ter. The itinerary unit is the kilometer. The unit of weight in commerce is the kilogram ; in analytic chemistry, the gram ; hectoliter in dry measure and liter in liquid measure, although the capacity of large casks is represented' in higher denominations, as w:e now use the hogs head, barrel, etc., although the gallon is the unit. Let us take some, examples aud illus trate the "inconvenience of our present system." The distance from Washington C. H. to Columbus, will suppose to be 64 kilometers, or, when reduced to 'yards,' C9992.1168. Now; w hich is the easier to retain in the memory,' 64 k. or 69992.1168 yards? 'But reduce it to higher denomi nations,' some will sav. 'Let it be done. Some argue with, of coyrse, no show of instead of 64 kilometers, we shall have Rheumatism a Disease of the Blood. The blood of this disease is found to contain an excess of fibrin. VEGETINE acts by converting the blood from its diseased condition to a neaitnv circulation.

MERCANTILE AT THIS OFFICE. much thought or investigation, that it is an unnecessary thing, therefore, not wor thy of consideration. While I was con ning this I saw Hon. Mills Gardner board a train, bound for Washington, D. C. I thought if he would be consistent with thesilly notion of "unnecessary," that he should demand a stage-coach, or an ox cart, or a slow-going pony, in order to gain the halls of our National Capitol. Again, it is said that the French Gov ernment is more arbitrary than ours, therefore, it may compel its subjects to an acceptation of the metric system ; but we note that which they demand, in this case, is accepted by the most enlightened nations of the globe; therefore, the case is not one of severity, but one of univer sal want. We would remind objectors that revolutions take time time for their beginning and consumation and still a longer time for the righting of all minor details. It took a long time to banish slavery, and still the evils of it exist; and yet no one would call back slavery to our fair land. It is argued that, if we adopt this sys tem, it would cause a change in books of mathematics, etc. Suppose it does ; that is no unsurmountable object; already many books on science and mathematics are written with the recognition of the metric system. Might as well argue that the reaper and self-binder are impracti cable, because you find in every shed and barn of the farm the relic of sickle and cradle. Some gentlemen, eminent in science, have critized the metric system on the ground that its base is not well chosen. If the system was once open to this crit icism, , scientific men having, in some cases, objected to it on account of inaccu racy in the determination f its base, the objection has evidently now ceased to be valid. Since the method proposed in 1872, for rendering the unit of length no longer dependent upon accurate measurement of the earth's meridian, has been adopted, the meter, though an artificial standard, has nevertheless become invariable. Whether or not it would have been bet ter in the beginning to have chosen the ten-millionth part of something else, say the diameter of the earth, or that of the sun, rather than the quadrant of the earth's meridian, is no longer a matter of the least practical importance, since once chosen and reproduced, it can hereafter never again be altered. I understand that Prof. Davies, in his lecture against the metric system, dis coursed mainly ou the disastrous conse quenses of giving up our short, sharp Saxon words for their equivalents ex pressed in a foreign language. I fear this little sacrifice must be made. The short, sharp Saxon yard must be given up for the clumsy meter, and the familiar dram must yield to the gram mysterious words de rived from an unknown tongue ! Though here, indeed, the difijrence will not be so keenly felt, as but one letter is altered, and we shall find some consolation from the loss of our dram in reflecting it is no less of Greek origin than gram. How exceedingly glorious to reflect that our short and simple kilderkins, barleycorns, pennyweights and hundred weights, must make way for the unpronounceable and incomprehensible liter, centimeter, centi gram and kilogram. Nay, even our dear ly beloved and graceful "hogsheads" and "puncheons," to say nothing of our del icate ''pipes" and "butts," must all be 39 miles, 245 rods, 3 yards, 1 foot, 10.2048 inches ; all this to express the distance between Washington ?. H. and our Cap ital The hectare is the agrarian unit of the new" system, "and contains 2.471 acres, which is large "enough to measure all farms. "Examples might be given of farms containing a certain number of hectares, which, being reduced to the old system, would contain acres, square rods, square yards, square feet, and, in case the land is very valuable,. square inches. And the capacity of a tank, containing a certain number of kilometers, may be expressed in hogsheads, gallons, quarts, pints and gills. However, some who have not ac quainted themselves with the beauty and simplicity of the decimal, still prefer the "simple, short aud comprehensible ex pressions" of the old system I will not attempt to follow these ob jectors further in their lament, but I can not refrain from giving one more exam ple, which has as much weight as any of fered by the assailants of the metric sys tem : How embarrassing it must be to the honest man, who, setting out to buy a round of ibeef for his dinner, after there have ceased to be any pounds, is aston ished at finding he will have to pay for the amazing number of grams expressed by the figures 3525, or, in case he is bankrupt by the large demand, will be permitted to compromise only on condition of buy ing 3 kilograms, 5 hectograms, 2 deca grams and 5 grams. I wish to present a parallel to this : He goes to his tailor, to purchase a coat, and tie states to nun a price, in a sum express ed by the four digits named above, and in the same order ; and, as all the readings are madeUn the "lowest unit," and the een-t being the lowest -money - unit ii-t price named, the tailor is under the ne cessity of informingfhlm that he can have the coat for 3525 cents, and it will not be lawful for him to vary the expression in any manner, unless he say, by way of al ternative, that he will give him the coat for 3 eagles, 5 dollars, 2 dimes and 5 cents I would advise the man not to buy his meat by the pound, after pounds have gone out of date, but to content himself with a round 3 kilograms, or, in case he is very hungry, say 3. Many of the objections offered against this grand reformation are evidently too groundless to justify their consideration, where amusement is not the principal ob ject sought after. Many, who once raised objections, seem scarcely to have been se rious in offering them. Since they were made, public opinion on this subject has undergone a material change, and many of those who once criticised are now among the most ardent advocates for what the majority of the world has made its international system of weights and measures. It is not expected that this system will make its way in the world against the will of the people. It is not expected that the people of the United States shall be coerced into receiving it by the force of "imperial edicts," or by the terror of the bayonet. They will, sooner or later, wel come it. They wilUbecome conscious of the many inconveniences to which they are subjected ; inconveniences which they have learned to endure without re flecting on their causes or suspecting that they" were unnecessary, in the nature of things; and, when fully awake to the slavery in which they live, they will For the Herald. County Supervision. BY J. P. PATTERSON", A. M. County Supervision is the paramount educational topic of the day in Ohio. This is a question demanding considera tion from all. What does it propose? Laying aside the postatate, viz: that our ungraded sehools need reformation, and accepting the statement that county su pervision Is the cure, we raise the ques tion : What are the considerations under which they may obtain ? First County sepervision exist in sev eral States and with different degrees of efficiency. Now, it is not fair to argue, selecting the worst condition of such su pervision, that Ohio schools are superior to the schools so supervised. Why not lay aside prejudice and ask the real ques tion: "now much inferior would such schools be to Ohio ungraded schools if such supervision did not exist?" This is the question in this connection. The com parison with unlikes is illogical. . Second It is a weak statement, when any one avers that the county superin tendent would be an autocrat. We can't grow autocrats in Democratic America. The most sanguine adherents of county supervision openly declare : that such an office as is contemplated, will, at most, be only executive. The measure proposes a large and intelligent County Board. They will employ and dismiss teachers. The most the superintendent can do will be to present merits and demerits of teachers. If there be any unfairness in such reports, a careful board will detect it. Where exists any danger in this, more than now exists in the present reign of affairs? Also, it must be noted, that the very questions to be given to applicants by the county superintendent, will be made by a State committee appointed for such pur poses, and that when the applicants standings are determined, the very pa pers on which they are made must be sent to headquarters for inspection. Where is there any chance In all this for auto cracy ? Third Some are riding the financial hobby phase of the issue. They say the measure will entail an. enormous taxa tion. This is a question of mathematics, and all know the merit of the argument of this old time family. The friends of the movement will show a retrenchment of present expenses with better results. We mean less expense. But, for the sake of argument, grant the more-expense doc trine, then, as true economists, we are bound to raise the question : Will the in creased facilities, etc., justify the outlay? That is, as the farmer argues, when he hangs up his grain cradle and gives his fields to the supremacy of the self-binder. Fourth The friends of county super vision in Ohio do not propose second-rate talent for the office. Xor do they propose that the incumbent of such office will share other offices and work. They insist that he shall be a man of ONEw'ork. Now we premise that men of substantial edu cation and goodness of heart, must, in the very nature of things, be the friend of the teacher. The first impulses of a good superintendent are on the side of the teachers ; no possible danger from such Fifth The objector says it will be a po litical affair. Now and then, this will be so; but, in a majority of instances, all po litical parties will rally about the best tal ent. Heart-interests arc touched, when the tuition of the child is under consid eration, and generally the verdict ot heart will be right. No matter what are the party affinities of the candidate. There are mauy affirmative considerations; but We desist further facts. We conclude by saying : if county supervision do not come up to the high plane above indicated, and even higher, then surely, we don't want it. TEMPERANCE COLiTJMN. Contributed by Ladies of Washington Temper' ance Union.! The Pale-Faced Abstainer. Those who have talked about rosy Eng lishmen and pale-faced Americans will do well to study what an Englisman says about pale-faces" In the following extract from a speech by Dr. Richardson : "Under the action of alcohol the re sistance to the current of blood through the vessels is diminished. This is Indi cated in the flush of countenance that is caused by wine in those who are unac customed to its use, in the flush which is permanently seated on the faces of so many who indulge in something more than its moderate use, in the purple uni form of features which is worn by so many of what are called the hard-drinkers of society. We see in all these the external sign of that diminished resist ance in the blood-vessels to the utterance of blood which alcohol induces in differ ent degrees. "It has been one of the reproaches thrown out by ordinary society against the practicing disciples of total absti nence that they are deficient in color, and therefore, so runs the argument, deficient iu blood, or deficient in some quality of blood. 1 gave a lecture not long since to an audience of total abstainers from alco hol in a large hall, in which a mulitude of the worshippers of Bacchus had the night before held high festival. I can not quite report that 'the funeral of baked meats did coldly furnish forth the mar riage tables,' but I can report that, an hour or so before my lecture, the odor of the feast was clearly perceptible in the still laden atmosphere of wine, and I can also report that one of my auditors, who was present at the wine-feast of the pre vious day, was full of description of the difference of complexion of the two meet ings in regard to the visages of the com- pauy. He compared the Bacchanalians to the rosy morning, and the abstainers to the pale evening; but he admitted that in matters of strength, or as he called iC, 'healthful solidity,' the abstainers were by far the most promising specimens of humanity. - "Those who laugh at the abstemious for being pale would be warranted in laughing if it were the fact that the red face they so much admire was a" face in dicative of health, and the pale face indi cative of disease. Unfortunately for their side of the case, that suffused face, that jolly red face, that dark red face is the face of disease, while the pale face is the face as nature meant it to be. Unfortu nately, also, for the laughers is the fact that the red face is not simply skin-deep and confined to the face. The same red ness extends to other and mere vital sur faces. The surfaces ot the brain and oth er vital organs are congested in like man ner, according to the degree ot injury that has been inflicted on the blood-ves sels by the paralyzing drug that is ac credited with so much usefulness. - "There is an immense population liv ing from day to day in this semi-paralyzed condition of the circulation. Tiiey are already, in the midst of their laugh ter, half wrecked. They are easily over balanced by slight causes, and they al most Inevitably fall prematurely into death If they continue in their course. Sometimes they fall from failure of the heart; sometimes, under a little extra excitement, a vessel gives way in the brain, and they become partially paral yzed, if they do not succumb immediately. Sometimes they get organic kidney or liver disease, or that consumption of the lung which I have already noticed. Physi cally, the condition of the whole of the members of this great population is very bad. They are the last that should make fun of the pale faces." REDDV, THE KOAD.AGENT. The Former Terror of the Black Bute Finally En Route to the Gallows, Chicago Inter-Ocean. Among the guests at the Palmer House yesterday was Mr.' Seth Bullock, Sheriff of Lawrence County, Dakota, head-quarters at Deadwood, the livliest town be tween the Missouri and breakfast. The object of his visit East is quite important and interesting. He is after one of the gentlemen road-agents, the Colt's revolv er fellows that made the Sidney, Neb., route to the Black Hills a terror to peace-; ful travelers a year ago. The road was a howling wilderness for a while when "Reddy," alias Bob McKimmie, "work-, ed" the stages along the line. But he came to the end of his tether, and proba bly will come to the end of the tether of Lawrence County's Sheriff before tne winter's snows disappear. "Reddy" has turned up in umo once more, and in a day or two will be ia the custody of Sheriff Bullock, who has come through from Deadwood to wait on the pleasure of the slayer of Johnnie Slaugh ter, a young man whom McKimmie ruth lessly murdered. This occurred about a year ago. "Reddy" left the country after the homicide, as the weather there was made altogether to sultry for the health of that individual. He skipped. The Sheriff didn't give up-the search, howev er. Rewards to the amount of about $2,500 were offered for "Reddy's" apprehension, but he seemed to be "living on greased lightning, for he skipped out and wan dered all the wav from the Black Hills until he got down into his old haunts in Ohio. He went .back to the same place where, when he was sixteen years of age, he suddenly disappeared from,-and turn ed up as a private in the army. Then he can a bloody road for awhile down in the South-west, deserting the army, killing Ills man, becoming a Utah brigand, and' ended by having a fifteen years' sentence pronounced upon him in the Mormon Garden of Eden. But they couldn't hold him there, and he squeezed out and was once more' on the war-path. A coupref yeavs ago he was with the gang of cut throats that terrorized the Black Hills for awhile. His career of crime was again marked with murder when he killed the son of Mr. Slaughter, a well-known citi zen of Chevenne. After this he left the road and was not captured until last spring, when Sheriff Bullock trailed him to his old haunts, in Highland -County, Ohio. "Reddy" had married a respecta ble young woman there, and was quite a reconstructed road agent. Of course the community sympathized with him,' and,' naturally enough, looked upon Bullock as the only road-agent that had ever in vaded his quiet community. The requi sition for "Reddy" from the Governor of Dakota was all right, but the case, after being Hi st decided by a local Conrt, was taken to the Supreme Court, which occas ioned a delay of over forty days. "Reddy" was jailed, and was getting fat, when he was supplied with arms and fixings by those who aided him on the outside. He broke jail one night, and, in escaping, shot one of his keepers. The road agent was himself again. But the old desire to, get back to the scene of some of his ex ploits brought him to Highland County, and was once more taken. Sheriff Bui-, lock left last evening for Ohio, and will in ten days be on his way to Black Hills with "Reddy," the scourge of the road. Sheriff Bullock is the same official who captured the notorious "Laughing Sam," one of the worst characters that infested the hills country; also Dan Blackburn, and a whole column .of rascals who, a year ago, were the pi rate3 of the plains,, and whose taking-off would be a lucky stroke for any country they might hap pen in on.

The uselessness of the effort, together with a feeling upon the part of everybody that it is well to let the present law take its course, has had some effect upon the members of Congress, even the most ul tra anti-resumptionists are disposed to keep quiet and see what will come out of the business. The confident assurance of the Secretary ot the Treasury in his abili ty to resume and maintain resumption, as put forth in his annual report have also had a great deal to do with bringing about a wholesome publicopinion. He has "assumed the pressure;" has staked his reputation, as it were, upon the meas ure, and as he has exhibited a great amount of financial statesmanship in the past, the people are disposed to trust him further. If Mr. Sherman proves to be sound in his opinions, and resumption , becomes an accomplished fact, he will FOR

The new names are tio more foreign than such words as dime, cent, mill, telescope and microscope, and a hundred others which, like "decigram," etc., are derived from the Greek and Lat in. Yet, we. should be sorry to "give up a great many valuable articles, simply because their names are of foreign origin. Moreover, it must be remembered that the metric nomenclature is composed of but twelve very short words. If, how ever, anyone finds these twelve words too much for him after having struggled a lifetime in the vain attempt to master the endless old ones, he may still use the short and sharp" Saxon names in his private affairs, even after the rest of the world has accommodated itself to the new system; just as many people, among us still use the old words, "shillings" and pence," though the majority have ac customed themselves to the use of those inconvenient Latin words, 'dime,' 'cent' and 'mill.' "The decimal division has failed, as applied to the circle." It has heen urged as a fact very mjurious to the pretensions of the metric system, that it has never been permanently applied to the circle. Those who use this argument ought to remember that the Arabic numerals, the symbols of algebra, and the divisions of the circle, are three things which were the same for all civilized mankind when the metric system was created. To change the law of circular division, was to intro duce diversity where uniformity prevailed before. Yet, the French did make the experiment of dividing the quadrantcen tcsimally, and by the ablest astronomers and gcodesists, its convenience was thought to be greater than our present division, and when the metric system shall be universal, it is probable that the decimal division will be once more ap plied to the circle' Nothing could be less convenient than the sexagesimal which Js now employed," ani In point of fact, which the metric system brings. This can not take plaee, of course, until the people are informed. Educational 'influ ences must be Invoked. The young should be educated to a thorough understanding of this system, and be perfectly familiar with its practical applications. The me tric ought to be taught in all our schools. It ought to be taught there as being the system actually in use among half the inhabitants of the civilized world, and without any regard to the question wheth er it is to be ours or not; and it ought, too, with special refence to this question, in order that another generation may meet It and settle it inteligently. And, when a generation shall have grown up, into whose minds-this knowledge shall have entered along with the first rudiments of their learning, the question will no longer have two sides; and then, when the Uni ted States shall cast away all other weights and measures for the metric, the people will not run after our Congress men, shouting: "Give us back our yard, ffallon. cram." etc.. as wo are told the people of England shouted in 1752 : 'give us back our eleven days,' when the Grego-! rian calendar was first introduced in that country. But still, after all this educa tion and training oCyouth, there may ex ist a few 6f the older brethren who cling to the former things. We will console them by saying, that when they go to their fathers and are no more, their bodies shall rest in a six-foot grave. We will not des ecrate it with a meter. F. M. Au.es. stand high in the estimation of the Amer ican people, and whatever honor accrues therefrom will redound to his benefit and the party he represents. We believe now and have so expressed ourselves a number of times in the past, that there will be difficulties in the way of resumption, and that when the day comes around scarcely a ripple will be felt in the financial world. In fact, we have been in a condition of practical re suption for some time past. Whatever hardships attended the effort, have all been surmounted, and the business com munity Is prepared for it. But resumption will bring one disap pointment with it. While we think it will be a good thing for the country, in that it will place business upon a better footing, yet we need not expect that the mere fact of resumption is going to build ud Drosneritv bv a sort of magic. There will be no sudden revival of trade no hot house prosperity. The flush days of war times and an inflated currency have in a measure passed away, and will not return until a similar unfortunate state of things again assails the country. These arc not the days of great specu lations and accumulations of sudden for tunes. Hereafter those who make money will do so by hard work, economy and uerseverancc. In time business will "re vive," but it will be a safe and secure bus iness. Profits will be smaller, dividends will be less ; but what a man earns will bo solid and substantial earnings. He may not have as much money, but it will be bettor money, and will buy more than iim nmni'v of tlio inflation period. The in&jgniflccnt Farm and bow It i, man aged. One of the finest farms in this cou ntry is owned by the McClelland brothe rs, near Cannonsburg. The soil is limestone and is in a high state of cultivation. It con tains 800 acres, one hundred of which are woodland. On it are two large, well ar ranged dwellings three apple and two peach orchards of good fruit, two large, substanti al barns, eight sheep sheds and stabling for twentyfive head of horses and the same number of cattle. This farm is stocked with 1700 head ot Merino sheep, 11 head of horses, 13 head of thor oughbred Durham cattle, 20 head of all grades, 68 head of hogs old aud young, nine of the number being thorougbred Berkshires. This season these gentlemen sheared 10,000 pounds of wool, for which they obtained 33 cents per lb. They have 60 acres of corn : cut 40 acres of wheat, 60 of oats, and about 100 of grass wnich made 220 tons of hay. In the management ot the larm, each brother has a special interest to look after They make it a rule to sell as soon as their product is ready for market, and claim that, taking one year with another, it is best to do so. They build none but board and paling fences, regarding them the cheapest and best, as such require less space and trouble. The farm buildings present a very at tractive appearance. There are quite a number of them, the motto of the propri etors being "shelter for everything Every spring these outbuildings, with the fences surrounding them are white washed. It is the aim of the brothers to lead in every class of production. They never follow. Washing ton Observer. A Railway Temperance Lecture.

"Twenty years ago," said the passen ger with the red ribbon in his button hole, "I knew that man whom you saw get off at the last station. He was a young man of rare promise, a college graduate a man of brilliant intellect and shrewd mercantile ability. Life dawned before him in all the glowing colors of fai Dromise. He had some money when he left college. He invested it in business and his business prospered. He marrleM a beautiful young girl whoboretiim three lovely children" The sad looking passenger, sitting on the wood box : VAU at one time?"

He began to drink beer. Ho liked it and encouraged A Southern Editor's Forebodings. A writer in the Columbia (S. C.) Begis ter saj-s of Wade Hampton who is "cast in the mold that gave to the world a AVashington and a Lee," and who "sits panoplied in his own virtue," where, the shafts of malice can not harm him, nor the flatterer's adulation spoil him" that South Carolina dare not lose his invalu able services until the great battle of 1880 fought aud won." The writer, there fore, opposes Governor Hampton's candi dacy for the United States Senate. The rticle continues : If the Republican party elects Llyses S. Grant President in 1880, the whole coun try will be again convulsed-by a war, the terrors and the magnitude of which will far exceed the most fearful examples of past history. The South, measurably re covered from her losses, having undisput ed sway over her entire territory, would be united as one man to resist the inso lent military tyranny which Grant would at once attempt to establish. But having within her own borders a large negro population, ruined by the teachings of the Radicals who so long ruled them, and encouraged by the incitements and in-. ducements which Northern emissaries wonld offer their ignorance, the South would be compelled either to remove them from the land or "to exterminate them. Deportation would be impossible, because the power of the Federal Govern- - ment would be used to prevent it. The navy would establish an embargo upon the export of negroes, and the South, without maritime power and perhaps without maritime allies, would be unable to remove the negroes to another country against their own desire. The negroes would not willingly leave the South, to which they are naturally attached, es pecially as the North would probably offer them inducements to remain which the boldest pen would hesitate to utter. Total extermination of the negro would thus become a necessity. This could not be done without danger to the whites. Even a worm will turn when tread upon. The natural ferocity of the negro nature, long subdued by slavery, at first social and afterward political, would exhibit itself In the burning homesteads of the wnite man, and in other horrors too fearful to contemplate. The work would be short and the end certain; but before it coma be accomplished untold miseries would accompany the bloody crusade. These are ' the dangers which overhang the country should the Republican party place Gen eral Grant in the Presidential chair In 18S0. We have not contemplated the pos sibility of Republican victory without Grant. We think the signs of the times show as clearly as any human judgment can compass the inevitable tendency of Republicanism at the North to Grantism. have been . -r ioii,ntinii inrlishonestv will be lessened, drank more.
