THE MESSAGE, (Continued from First Page.) draft of bill, made by the pnblie lands' com munion, which were commnnioated by me to Congress at the last session. Early motion upon this important subject is highly desir able. The attention of Congress is again asked to the wasteful depredations committed on our public timber lands, and the rapid and indir oriminate destruction of oar forests. The argent necessity for legislation to this end is now generally recognised. In view of the lawless character of the depredations com mitted and the disastrous oonsequenoes whioh will inevitably follow their oontinuance, legis lation has again and again been recommended to arrest the evil and to preserve for the peo pie of onr Western States and Territories th timber needed fordomestic and other essential THE GEOLOGICAL STJBVEY. The report of the director of the geological survey is a document of unusual interest. The consolidation of the various geological and geographical surreys and exploring enterprises, each of whioh bss Heretofore operated upon an independent plan without concert, csnnot fail to be of great benefit to all those industries of the country which depend upon the develop ment of our mineral resources. The labors of the scientific men of recognized merit who compose the corps of the geological survey, during the first season of their field operations and inquiries, appear to have been very com prehensive, and will soon be com municated to Congress in a number of volumes. The director of the survey recom mends that the investigations carried on by his bureau, which so far have been confined to the so-called public land States and Territories, be extended over the entire country,and that the necessary appropriation be made for this pur pose. This would be particularly beneficial to the iron, coal and other mining interests of the Mississippi valley and of the Eastern and Southern States. The subject is commended to the careful consideration of Congress. DBTABTMENT BUILDINGS. The secretary of the interior asks attention to the want of room in the public buildings of the capital now existing and in progress of construction for the accommodation of the clerical force employed, and of the pnblio rec ords. Necessity has compelled the renting of private buildings in different parts of the city for the location of pnblie offices, for which a large amount of rent is snnnally paid, while the separation of offices belonging to the same department impedes the transaction of current business. The secretary suggests that the blocks snrrounding Lafayette square, on the east, north and west, be purchased as the sites for new edifices, for the accommodation of government offices, leaving the square it self intact, and that if such buildings were constructed upon a har monious plan of architecture they would add much to the beauty of the national capital and would, located -there, with the treasury and the new state, navy and war department building.form one of the most imposing groups of public edi fices in the world. BUBEATJ OF AGRICULTURE. The commissioner of agriculture expresses the confident belief that bis efforts in behalf of the production of our own sugar and tea have been encouragingly received. The im portance of the results attained have attracted marked attention at home ana have received the special consideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our own teaand the manufacture of onr own sugar would make ft difference of many millions of dollars annu ally in the wealth of tbe nation. The report of the commissioner asks atten tion particularly to the continued prevalence of an infectious and contagaous cattle disease known and dreaded in Europe and Asia ai the cattle plague or pluro-pnenmonia. A mild type of this disease in certain sections of our country is the occasion of great loss to onr formers, and of serious disturbance to our trade with Great Britian, which famishes a market for much of our live stock and dressed meats. The value of neat cattle exported from the United States for the eight months ended August 31, 1880, was more than twelve million dollars, and nearly double the value for the same period in 1S79, an unexampled increase of export trade. Your early attention is solicit ed to this important matter. 

EDUCATIONAL. The commiesinrier of education reports a continued increase of public interest in educa tional affairs, and that the public schools gen erally throughout the country are well sus tained. Industrial training is attracting de served attention, and colleges for instruction, theoretical and practical, in agriculture iind tbe mechanic arts, including tbe government schools recently established for the instruction of Indian youth, are gaining steadily in public estimation. Tbe commissioner asks special attention to the depredations committed on the lands reserved for the future support of public institutions and to the very great need of help from the nation for schools in the Territories and in the Southern States. The recommendation heretofore made is repeated and urged that an educational fund be set apart from the net proceeds of the sales of the public lands, annually, the income of which, and the remainder of the net annual proceeds, to be distributed on some satisfactory plan to the States and Territories and the District of Columbia. The success of the public schools of the Dis trict of Columbia and tbe progress made un der tbe intelligent direction of the board of education and the superintendent in supplying the educational requirements of the district with thoroughly trained and efficient teachers is very gratifying. The acts of Congress from time to time, do nating pnblie lands to tho several States and Tcrritories.in aid of educational interests, have proved to be wise measures of public policy, resulting in great and lasting benefit. It would seem to be a matter of simple justice to extend the benefits of this legislation, the wis dom of which bos been so fully vindicated by experience to the 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 1 again commend the general interests of the District of Columbia to the favorable consider ation of Congress. The affairs of the district as shown by the report of the commissioners, are in a very satisfactory condition. In my annual messages heretofore, and in my special message of December 19, 1679, I have urged upon the attention of Congress the necessity of reclaiming tbe marshes of the Potomac, adjacent to the capital, and I am con strained by its importance to advert again to the subject. These Hats embrace an area of several hundred acres. They are an impediment to tbe drainage of the city and seriously impair it* health. It is believed that with this sub stantial improvement of its river front the capital would be in all respects one of tbe most attractive cities in the world. Aside from its permanent population this city is necessarily the place of residence of persons from every sestion of the country engaged in the public service. Many others reside here temporarily for the transaction of business with tbe government. It should not be for gotten that tbe land acquired will probably be worth the cost of reclaiming it, andthat the navigation of the river will be greatly improv ed. I, therefore, again invite the attention of Congress to the importance of prompt provis ion for this much needed ind too long delayed improvement. The water supply of the city is inadequate. In addition to the ordinary use throughout the city, the consumption by the government is necessarily very great in the navy yard, ar senal and the various departments, and a large quantity is required for the proper preserva tion of the numerous parks and the cleansing of sewers. I recommend that this subject re ceive the early attention of Congress, and that in making provision for an increased supply such means be adopted as wil have in view the future growth of the city. A temporary expedient for such a purpose can not but be wasteful of money and therefore unwise. A more ample reservoir with corres ponding facilities for keeping it filled should in my judgment be constructed. 1 commend again to the attention of Con gress the subject of the removal from their present location of the depots of the several railroads entering the city, and I renew the recommendations of my former message* in behalf of the erection of a building for the Congressional library, the completion of the Washington monument and of liberal appro priations insopport of the benevolent, reforma tory and penal institutions of the district. 

BTJTHERFOKO B. HAYES. Executive Mansion, Dec. 6,1880. KATE FIELD, who is evidently on the brink of a, lecture tour, 1ms confided to a Boston reporter tho important fact that sheprefers the short paragraphs in newspapers to "the long and labored editorial articles." Some day Kate will come across a column article about her self, written toy a woman, and will pe ruse it with intense interest, after which she will admit that for wild fascination there is nothing like a column of "friend ly" criticism. Tnn prize Christmas-card design in London, like that in America, was won by a young lady. Nine hundred works were sent in there in response to an offer of a first prize of only $500—one-half the American prize. This throng of competitors is a faint sign of the number of perijjpns taking to art in England in the reign of the good Queen Victoria, and, as America follows suit at a due interval, of the number there soon will be here, CURRENT TOPICS.

His three daughters and their mother sailed for Euiope a few days ago, and the young ladies will enter a school at Stuttgart. INDIA, Ceylon and Africa arc direct ly interested in the recent expedition to northern Asia, resulting in a great im petus given the fossil ivory trade. The superior quality of Indian and African ivory, however, will always gain it a preference for certain classes of goods. There arc several flourishing schools in China conducted by American teach ers, and through the translation depart ment of the empire more than 80,000 volumes of translated works in science, ait, etc., have been sold. In the schools of this country 120 Chinese youths are receiving instruction. AFTER "Pinatore" had been played in Boston 350 times the "Ideal" Company was formed and crowded the great Bos ton theatre for a period ot seven weeks to the enormous receipts of $192,000 The smallest week's receipts were $23, 700! The expenses of the company are positively over $1,200 per night. EDWIN BOOTH has presented to Dr. Ghislani Durant of New York, a very elegant cup of solid silver, manufactured to order by Tiffany & Co. It is inlaid with gold and lavishly ornamented with repouse work. The cup cost $1,000, and is a testimonial ot gratitude to the phy sician for curing the actor of the danger ous disease known as the "black tongue," with which he was some time ago at acked. OWEN BROWN, son of old John Brown, who was a participant in that famous affair at Harper's Ferry, which cost his father his ?ife, lives alose upon an island in Lake Erie, where Jay Cooke had a famous summer residence, near the scene of "Perry's Victory." His brother John lives near him, on Put-in-Bay island, where he farms and tishes, and is the head of a family.

Last spiing*s pea crop aver aged $75 per acre, net: thepotatoecrop, in many instances, realized §100 per acre. THE population of Chili but little ex ceeds 2,000,000, yet she possesses a capital of $666,000,000, nearly one-quarter of that amount being invested in banking. The Chilian mines at one time consti tuted the chief source of revenue, but in later years that honor has been divided with the agricultural industries. Dur ing the years 1844 '78 Chili exported $672,000,000 wgrth of agricultural and mineral produce. There has been a gradual decline in Chilian prosperity since 1874-'75, but a change for the bet ter was visible when the war broke out with consequences naturally latal. AN amusing anecdote concerning cx Gvernor Bishop, of Ohio, is told in Cleve land. It is related that arrangements weie made one evening during the recent fair to serenade the president of the State Board of Agriculture, and that func tionary had collected his thoughts for presentation and was about to appear on the balcony and address the band and the crowd, when Mr. Bishop drove up to the hotel with several friends. The ex Governor, with the calmness of a great man, took the serenade to himself, and rising in the carriage bewed gracefully and responded in a characteristic speech. The band dispersed, the ex-Governor retired, and the poor agricultural president's speech was never made. MR. THOMAS HUGHES was exceedingly interested in observing the fashion of co education as he saw it at Swarthmorc College the other day. He closed his address with a few sentences on the sub ject which may perhaps seem unreason able to the thoughtless boys in those col leges which clamor loudest against co education. "I cannot help, feeling," said Mr. Hughes, "that in the future tt a chief education lies in this joint education. There has been one small experiment in our country by some ladies, Misses Lush ington, and upon young men and boys thejoint education has had a most human, izing effect. The boys were wonderfully more human and gentle than they were at the great principle you are building upon may be complete success, and that you may prove that joint education is the true education ot the future in the higher ranches. THERE toils now,as head manufacture in the Highland Mills at Huntington, Mass., William Crawford, who, in his career, was partner in one of tho largest mercantile houses in Scotland, and who himself sold to Claflin of New York, in one-half hour, 1,723 cases of dry goods, amounting to 3,456,000 yards. Another index of the business of the house was the paying to one manufacturer in one seeson $250,000 for shawls to ship to the American trade, besides large amounts to other shawl makers. Investments in Spanish trade in the time ot the Spanish war wrecked him financially, he loosing by the Don Carlos muddle $300,000, and. with a large family to support, he came cheerfully down to work again. The Highland Mills are now run largely on cloakings and on orders ior Boston houses. :4 TtUGMPmC inEfmts.

It wss lying face downward—no flesh on the bones—but hickory shirt over the body, well preserved It is believed to be the body of Billy James, who has been missing since hut June. Last Thanksgiving day was tbe coldest ex perienced in Minnesota for the last seven year*. John 8tearna, of Red Wing, who baa kept record for years, ssya tbe mercury reached the same point, 22 degrees below sero, the late Thanksgiving, thst it did seven years ago. The Bed River Free Press asya the d-outh of wood upon the prairie districts along tbe line of the St. Paul, Minneapolis A Manitoba rail road, has been keenly felt during tbe past cold westher, but the company oame nobly to tbe assistance of the people, who sre tbua saved from suffering. The Advocate says: Thanksgiving waa not much of holiday in Jordan. All of the buai ness houses were open as usual snd trade ap peared to be about an average. People came in from the country snd bought their groceries, an is their custom, snd tbe streets did not in dicate any particular change in tbe day's pro gramme. The new Congregational church in Lake City is rapidly advancing to a complete finish. J. C. Doughty put tbe new furnace into it last week. The seats snd tbe glass sre still behind time in arriving. Tbere sre number of things yet to be purchased, in addition to these, and it will probably be the middle of January be fore the new edifice is dedicated. The twenty-fifth annual meeting of the Rice County Bible society was held iu Faribault Nov. 28. The officers of tbe ensuing year are, president, R.a. Mott vice president, Prof. H. A. Pratt secretary, Lyman B.Smith treasurer, E. N. Leavens librarian, F. S. Wilson exeeu tive committee, Rev. R. Forbes, Rev. E. C. Sanders and Rev. T. 0. Northcott. Lake City Leader, November 30: On Satur day last, as Andrew Boss, of Gill ford, was going home from this city, the bolt that couples the tongue to tbe wagon came out and the tongue dropped to tbe ground, frightening tho team. Mr. Boss held on to the lines and was dragged over the dashboard out of the wagon. In tbe fall hia right shoulder waa badly bruised and his right hip was broken. The Rush City, Chisago county, Post, an nounces lively trsdc in wood, saying "the wood dealers sre the busiest men out just at present, and the one who gets the wood is the smartest." They are making all the contractu possible at $4 per cord, snd the Rush City buy ers all buying at the rate of 500 to 1,000 cords daily. Tbe prospect is, so some of tbe buyers claim, that dry maple will yet be worth $4.50 per cord. The Winnebago City, Faribault county. Times of Nov. 37, says: "The cold snap and penetrating winda of the week have been hard on both man and horse. A greet msny per sons sre laid up with a species of epizootic, and there is scarcely a family bnt what has some one afliicted with it. Sore throat is prevalent, snd there arc some cases of diphtheria reported, but of very light form. It will pay well to be extra careful for the present. New Ulm Review: Henry Mueller, of Lafay. ette township, Nicollet county, across tbe river from this place, threshed about 3,000 bushels of wheat snd over 1,500 bushels of osta a few days ago. He raised about 1,000 bushels of Mamcotb wheat which average about twenty bushels to the acre. Tbe wheat weighs sixty two pounds per bushel, struck measure, snd without being clesnsd sfter being taken from tbe separator. Long Prairie (Todd county) Argus: Many of our readers will remember Edward Mahoney who was confined in the jail at this place last summer on account of insanity. After attempt ing to have him cared for in the ounty, with out success, the commissioners had him taken to the hospital at St. Peter. He occupied apartments directly over that part of the base ment where the recent fire broke out, and is supposed to have been the first poor victim to succumb to the raging element. He wss par tially paralyzed snd could not have escaped without assistance. He wss probably one of the number whose band full of ashes was buried recently. Tbe Sauk Rapids Sentinel reports that as Joseph 8chindler, of St. Cloud, was going out to Gilmanton for load of wood, one of bis horses stepped into rut in tbe rosd nesr Mayhew creek, snd in attempting to free itself fell snd broke leg. Mr. Sehindler did not know the extent of the horse's injury snd started to drive home, but could get no further tbsn the St. Cloud bridge, when it was found necessary to kill tbe horse. A wood fight is reported sa having taken place at Bird Island the other day. Three flat cars loaded with wood arrived at that time, snd tbe citizens of tbe village, together with about fifty farmers from tbe neighboring country, made rush for the wood with their teams, piling on their aleds and wagons what they could get bold of without waiting for the wood to be measured. A citizen ands farmer came to blows over one losd, but tbe citizen got swsy witb the wood. Jordan (Scott oonnty) Advocate, Dec. 2: Last Friday evening, Peter Ruppert, who lives near St. Joseph's eburch, started for home with bis aleigh partly loaded with mill feed snd with cow tied to the rear end of the sleigh. On the hill just beyond tbe Union ball is high embankment, in dangerous proximity to the road, and at this place the cow became unruly and pulling the sleigh to one side, threw it over into tbe guUy. Mr. Ruppert was buried under the sleigh snd ita losd, snd wss taken out considerably bruised. That be eaeaped serious injury was fortunate, indeed, consider ing tbe locality and nature of the accident. as Tbe Largest Island. It has hitherto been the custom of geographers to give the palm to Borneo as the largest island in the world, but this is decidedly an error. A careful estimate, founded on the most recent maps, shows that New Guinea is consid erably the larger, and must for tlje future be accorded the first place. In shape, this island differs greatly from Borneo, being irregular, and much ex tended in a north-northwest and south southeast direction, so that its greatest length is little «roort of 1,500 miles, a distance as great as the whole width of Australia from Adelaide to Port Darwin, or of Europe from London to Constanti nople. Its greatest width is 410 miles and, omitting the great peninsulas which form its two extremities, the central mass is about 700 miles long, with an average width of 320 miles—a country about the size of the Australian empire, and, with the exception of the course of one large river, an absolute blank upon our maps. IN rt Missouri town, a thief, being caught in a man's cellar, explained that he was there to get out of the way of a cyclone. A TnrtbfW P$*r A Taunton clergyman said: "N newvpaper which takes truth for a stand sxd csii make a pecuniary success." It would be a fair retort to nay that any newspaper which made statements as recUessiT as some clergymen do would be ruined without recourse. This Taun ton divine may be surprised to learn a fact well understood in every honorable newspaper office, namely, that more money is often spent in investigat ing rumors which prove baseless, and therefore yield nothing for publication, than for the news which the public sees in print.—New York Sun. [UochcBt rrkntlne'.l "slackwheat Cakes aa« the Maasiew." When a young husband had gone from home, and with fond solicitude tele graphed his little wife,—"what have you tor breakfast, and hows the baby?"—he received the brief, suggestive reply, "Buckwheat Cakes and the Measles." We have the report of a case in our midst, not where Measles was in the bill of fare, but where Sciatic Rheumatism confined Mr. J. Dawson, the well known druggist, to bis room for a long period. It was stated to aur reporter in the following words: The senior of this firm was at tacked with Sciatic Rheumatism De cember last, and for four weeks could scarcely leave his room. Ho used St. Jacobs Oil, and is now able to be at his place of business, feeling no worse for his recent affliction. The inference is con vincing. if must be rather trying to ba mar ried to an emotional, actress, to have her clutching you by the throat at 3 a. m. and shouting in a hoarse, stage whisper: Slave, didst lock the kitchen door?
