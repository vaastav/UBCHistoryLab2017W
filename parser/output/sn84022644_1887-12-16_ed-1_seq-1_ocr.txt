A I read 1 have reported to yeu the cur rent capital gosalp concernlag the Cabinet changes that Mr. Lamar will be trans lated to the Supreme Beuch, that Port matter General Vilas U to succeed him, and that Mr. Dickinson of Michigan, will be the latter' successor. Still another rumor Is that Mr. Whitney evpects to re sign from the Cabinet unless his health greatly improves within the neat two months, his friends claiming that a of the vast wealth and great sawia! prom inence of the present Secretary ef Bg Navy, cannot afford to endanger hla eg. istence by further devoting himself to the onerous d uties Incumbent upon him. Many New York Democrats were es- tremely solicitous for the President to to his eld home at Buffalo and vote In the late election, and much disappointment waa felt that he did not gratify public expec tation In thst respect. But the President had a good reason for absenting hlmseff, aa he had learned from trust worty sources, that his presence at the polls would have been the occasion of an undignified and unseemly demonstration on the part of a club of intensely partisan Republican, as It was their unpatriotic purpose to chal lenge Mr. Cleveland's right to vote, on the ground that he Is not now a legal real dent of Buffalo. In view of this exposed conspiracy, It is doubtful if Mr. Cleveland again votes during hi Presidency, end when his motive Is understood, it will be applauded by all unbiased minds. Messrs. Carlisle and Randall sre both la ths city, and while neither Is willing to tske the public into his confidence, through the medium of the press, It is highly probable thst these great leaders may have an Informal conference before the meeting of Congress, with the view of making "ths two wings of the Democracy flap together on the tariff question, in the Isngusge of Mr. Rsndsll during a speech In the Forty ninth Congress. The forthcoming report of Secretary Psirchlld is awaited with no ordinary de gree of interest by the financial world, as it Is expected that he will tske advanced ground on the questions of the Treasury surplut,end the silver currency. That the Secretary Is laboriously and carefully ap plying himself to the important under taking that devolves upon him, is evidenc ed by the fact that to accomplish it he has for several day confined himself to the privacy of his home, In order not to be diverted from his work by visitor to the Department. Secretary Lamar In his report, which is completed but not yet published, recom- mrndi that th) fntratal Cnmnymrr- w j' ne a sen m wmmmw was vtir s m sponsible to Congrsss or the President ior Its acts, as at present the Secretary of tint interior only officiates in the capacity of disbursing officer for the Commission It appearing that he has no jurisdiction over that body at all. There Is a great pressure of business st ths Genersi Lsnd Office in the way of Is suing agricultural patents, agoo having been made out during the past month.and others in course of prepsrstion will in crease the number to 5,000 for the month of November, which almost outrival any previous record. The balance of power in the United States Senate Is lodged with the rollick ing Riddteberger, the Senator from Vir ginia, who holds In the hollow of his hand the political future of three Democratic claimants to seats Messrs. Lucas sod Faulkner, of West Virginia, and Mr. Tur- pie, of Indiana. Senator Riddteberger states that he will endeavor to act as con scientioustv in these controversies as If ha were on the Supreme Bench of the United States. The Republican Senate has more than enough chairmanships to go around there being forty -seven Senate committees to only thirty -eight Republican Senators, and so It Is likely that the majority party will very generously bestow the nine sur plus places on their Democratic brethren. 

SOROFULA I do not believe that Ayer's fiarsaparlUa has an aanal as a cure for Scrofulous Hu mors. It Is pleasant to take, gives strength to the body, and pro duces a more perma nent result than any medicine I ever used. E. Haines, North Humors, Llndale, Ohio. I hare used Avar's Ssrsaparilla, in my family, for Scrofula. and know, if it is taken faithfully it will thoroughly eradicate this terrible disease. W. F. Fowler, U. D., Erysipelas, ureenvuie, Tenn. For forty roars I have suffered with Erysipelas. I have tried various remedies Canker, and for my complaint, but found no relief until I commenced using Ayer's Sarasparilla.

Wasiiinotom. Senator Stewart, of Ne vada, lays he will not Introduce at present the bill presented tv him Isst winter, pro- f tar thedlvhme of Idaho Territory, giving the southern half to Nevada and the northern panhandle to Washington Territory. There appears to be a marked diversity of opinion among the cltfsens of Nevada on this proposition. Western Nevada Is said to be opposed to the an nexation, and Eastern Nevada where the leanen mostly congregate, favors it. Idaho will resist the division, end the temper of all concerned will be clearly as. certained before Senator Stewart moves In the matter Naw Yon k . The Commercial Advertitrr ia speaking of the President's message, says . "The novelty In the form and the unconventional tone of the message, as well as the urgent and overshadowing im portance of the single topic It considers, will attract the universal attention of the nation to the document. If we are not mistaken, it will have decisive weight In the future of the two parties and of legis lation." The Pot says editorially : "The mes sage deals with nothing but public finan. BSfl and the moans of bringing about equi librium between receipts and expendi tures. This Is unusual, but under the cir cumstance entirely wise. In order to make the deepest Impression on the pub lic mind en a moat Important, if not the only important, topic of public concern, It was necessary. Otherwise, when the ses sion got advanced, tt would be next to impossible to secure say result, as other important matters would absord ail the at tention of Congrsss. The people on the Paciic Coast, he says, feel the seed of the Posts) Telegraph more than any one else." The World eays s "In thus pressing up on Congress the Issue of a paramount Im portance to the exclusion of all other Is sues, the President has shown a true com prehension of the situation. He has championed the cauae of the long over burdened tax-payera. He has made him self the defender of the business interests Imperiled by the prospective lockups of the money, and he has also supplied his party with what It has long lacked an Is sue and a leader. W asm 1 wgto, The secretary of the treasury to-dsy transmitted to Congress estimates of the appropriation required for the fiscal rear ending Inns x 1880.

A number of gentlemen representing wool-growers and wool deal era met at the Ebbitt house to-night, fo the purpose of considering what should be done to revive the wool industry of the country. The object is to secure harmony among the different branches of the wool ladustrv, and to fix a basis of duty upon which dealers, growers and manufacturers can unite. It was the belief that con gressional action might be secured ou a bill which would nearly equalise the bur dens of the present tariff. - asa' THE
