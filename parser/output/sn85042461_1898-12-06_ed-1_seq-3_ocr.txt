Congress is risked to assist the people of Cuba in building up a Just, be nevolent and humane government. Our intercourse with oUier nations— the rupture with Spain excepted— has been marked by great cordiality. No serious international problems are presented. Greece asks for the removal of the r duty on Zante currants. The people are congratulated upon the success of the American exhibit at Hamburg. The failure of the nttempt to consolidate the governments of Central America is discussed. The early construction by the government of the Nicaragua canal is urged ln emphatic terms. President McKinley considers the Chinese question in such a shape ns to obviate the necessity of our country's taking a part in it. The people are congatulated upon the ine:eased space secured at the Paris exposition, and congress is urged to increase the appropriation there for. Tariff negotiations for reciprocal relations are now in progress with Prance and Germany. Efforts are in progress to induce the Swiss and Ger man governments to relax their prohibition of the importation of dried fruits. Our favorable relations with Great Britain are briefly commented upon. An acute but not serious difference with Mexico has arisen through dif- views of the extradition treaty. It will doubtless be settled amicably. Mr. McKinley urges an international agreement to regard all private property as exempt from capture or destruction in time of war. A brief statement is made regarding the revenues and the condition of the treasury.

MESSAGE IN FULL As Submitted to the Lawmakers of the Nation in Congress / WASHINGTON. Dec. s.—The President "swot to Congress the following message: To the Senate and House Of Represents, fives: Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered uecessury by the war, our people rejoice iv a very satisfactory and steadily in creasing degree of prosperity, evidenced by the largest volume of business ever record ed. Every manufacture has been productive, agricultural pursuits have yielded abundant returns, labor in the fields of industry is bet ter rewarded, revenue legislation passed by the present Congress has increased the treas ury's receipts to the amoiinl estimated by its authorities, the finances of the govern ment have been successfully administered nnd its credit advanced to the first rank, while its currency has been at tho world's highest standard. Military service under a common flag and for a righteous cause has strengthened the national spirit and served to cement more closoly than ever the fraternal bonds be tween every section of the country. A re view of the relations of the I'nited States to other powers, always appropriate, is in this year of primary importance, in view of the momentous issues which have arisen, de manding in one instance the ultimate de termination by arms and involving far reach ing consequences which require the ear nest attention of the Congress. WAR 

WITH SPAIN A Brief Resume of Its Causes and Effects In my last annual message very full consid eration was given to the question of the duty of the government of the United States towarel Spain and the Cuban insurrection, as being by far the most important prob lem with which we were culled upon to deal. The considerations then advanced, and the exposition of the views therein expressed, disclosed my sense of the extreme gravity of the situation. Setting aside, as logically unfounded, or practically inadmis sible, the recognition of the Cuban insur gents as belligerents, the recognition of the independence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a ratified com promise between the conn-itii'its, tntervi n tion in favor of one or the other party and the forcible annexation ol the inland. I con eluded it was honestly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be Assembled at Washington | given a reasonable chance to realize her ex- I pectatious of reform to which she had be- I come irrevocably committed. Withiita few weeks previously she had announced com | prchensivc plans which, it was conlidcntlv asserted. would be efficacious to remedy the evil so deeply affecting our own country, so injurious to the true interests of the mother country, as well as to those of Cuba, und so repugnant to the universal sentiment of humanity. The ensuing months brought little sign of real progress toward the pacification of Cu ba. Ihe autonomist administration set up in the capital and sonic of the principal cit ies appeared not to gain the favor of the in habitants, nor. to be able to extend their in llueiice to the large extent of territory held by the insurgents, while the military arm Obviously unable to cope with the still active rebellion, continued many of the most ob jectionable and offensive policies of the gov ernment that had preceded it. No tangible relief was afforded the vast numbers of un happy reconoentrndos, despite the reiterated professions maris in that regard, and the amount appropriated by Spain to that end. Ihe proffered expedient of zones of culti vation proved illusory indeed. No less prac tical nor mpre.delusive promises of succor could well have been tendered to the ex hausted and destitute people, stripped of all that made life and home dear and herded in a strange region among unsympathetic stran gers hardly less necessitous than themselves. By the end of December the mortality among them had frightfully increased Con servative estimates from Spanish sources placed the deaths among these di-trosed peop.c at over fo per cent from the time of General \\ eyler s decree of reconcentra tion was enforced. With the acquiescence of the Spanish authorities a scheme was adopted for relief by charitable contribu tions raised in (his country and distributed under direction of the Consul-General and the several Consuls, by noble and earnest individual effort through the organized agencies of the lied Cross. Thousands of lives were thus saved, but many thousand more were inaccessible to such forms of aid. The war contir.iutd on the old footing without comprehensive plan, developing only the same spasmodic encounters, barren of strategic result, that had marked the courses of the earlier ten-years' rebellion as well ns the present insurrection from its istart. No alternative save physical ex LOS 

ANGELES HERALD: TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 6, 1898 haushon of either combatants and there- Witha the practical ruin of the island, lat in sight, but how far distant no one could venture to conjecture. DESTRUCTION OE THE MAIN X At this juncture, on the 15th of Febru ary last, occurred the destructioß of the battleship Maine, while rightfully lying in the harbor ot Havana, on a mission of in ternational courtesy and good will, a cata strophe the suspicious nature and horror | of which stirred the nation's heart profound | ly. It is a striking evidence of the poise | and sturdy good sense distinguishing our ! national character that this shocking blow j falling upon a generous people, already deep ly touched by preceding event.- in* Cuba, | did not move them to a desperate resolve Ito tolerate no longer the existence of a con dition of danger and disorder at our doors that made possible such a deed by whomso ever wrought. Yet, the instinct of justice prevailed, and the nation anxiously awaited the result of the searching investigation at once set on foot. The finding of the naval board of inquiry established that the origin Of the explosion was external, by a mb roarine mine, and only halted through lack of positive testimony to fix the responsibil ity of its authorship. All those things carried conviction to the most thoughtful, even before the find ing of the naval court, that a cri-i.. in our affairs with Spain and toward Cuba was at hand. So strong was the belief, that it needed but a brief executive suggestion to Congress for it, to give immediate answer lo the duty of making in.-tant provision for the possible and perhaps speedily probable emergency of war, and the remarkable, al most unique, spectacle was presented of a unanimous vole of both Houses on the 9th of March, appropriating fifty million dol lars, "for the national defense and lor each and every purpose connected therewith, to be expended at the discretion of the Presi llfiril " That this act of provision came not too soon was disclosed when the application of the fund was undertaken. Our forts were pinotically undefended. Our navy needed large provision for increased ammunition and supplies and even numbers, to cope with any sudden attack from the navy of Spain, which comprised modern vessels of the highest type of continental perfection. Our army also required enlargement of men and munitions. The details of the hur ried preparation for the dread contingency is told in the reports of the secretaries of war and of the navy and need not be re peated here. Jt is sufficient to say that the outbreak of war, when it did come, found cur nation not unprepared to meet the conflict. Nor was the apprehension of coming strife confined to our own country. It war. felt by the continental powers, who, on April 6th, through their ambassadors and envoys, addressed to the executive an expression of hope that humanity and moderation might mark the course of this government and people, and that further negotiations would lead to an attempt, which, while securing the maintenance of peace, would affirm all necessary guarantees for the re-establish ment of order in Cuba. In responding to that presentation, I also shared the hope that the envoys had expressed, that peace might be preserved in a manner to termi nate the chronic condition of disturbance in Cuba, so injurious and menacing to our in terests and tranquillity, as well as shocking to our sentiments of humanity; and, while appreciating the humanitarian and disin terested character of the communication they had made on behalf of the bowers, I stated ihe confidence of this government on its part, that equal appreciation would be shown for its earnest and unselfish endeav ors to ftillfill a duty of humanity by ending a situation the indefinite prolongation of which had become insufferable. NEGOTIATION FAIEB Still animated by the hoi c of a peaceful solution and obeying the dictates of duty, no effort was relaxed to bring about a speedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne gotiations to this effect continued actively with the government of Spain looking to the immediate conclusion of a six months armistice in Cuba with a view to effecting the recognition of her people's right to in" dependence. Besides this, the instant re version of the order of reconsideration was asked, so that the suffering returning to their homes antf aided by united American and Spanish effort, might be put iv a wav to support themselves and, by orderly re sumption of the well nigh destroyed' pro ductive energies of the island, contribute to the restoration of its tranquillity and well being. Negotiations continued for some lit tle time at Madrid, resulting in oilers by the Spanish government which could not but l-e regarded as inadequate, it was proposed to I confide the preparation of peace to the in sular parliament jet to be convened under the autonomous decrees ol November, 1807 but without impairment in any wise of the constitutional powers of the Madrid gov- 1 eminent, which to that end would grant an armistice, if solicited by the insurgents, for ' such time as the general in chief might sec fit to fix. How and with what scope of div cretionary powers the insular parliament was expected to set about the "preparation" of peace, did not appear. If it was to be by ; negotiations with insurgents, the issue seemed to rest on the one side with a body chosen by that faction Of tin electors m the districts, under Spanish control, and on the other with the insurgent population ' holding the interior country, until repre- j Mined in the so-called parliament and de fiant at tin 1 suggestion of sueing for peace. Grieved aud disappointed at this barren ' outcome of my sine-ere endeavors to reach a practicable solution ,1 felt it my duty to ! remit the whole question to tin- t'ongi'ess. , In the message of April 11,1898, I announced that with this last overture in the direction of immediate peace in Cuba and it- disap pointing reception by Spain, the effort of ! the Executive was brought to an end. 1 again reviewed the alternative pourse ot action ' which 1 had prepared, concluding that the i only consonant with international policy a:.(| computable with our firmest set historical I j traditions was intervention as a neutraltol] stop the war and check the hopeless saori-j! lice of life, even though that resort involved j ' "hostile constraint upon both the parti-s to • the contract, as well as to enforce a truce' ' as to guide the eventual settlement." Tha grounds justifying thai step were the ' interest's of humanity; the duty to protect [ life and property of our < itizens in Cuba;the 11 right to protect our commerce, and, nn„; important, the need of removing at once and ' forever the constant menace and tlie bur dens entailed upon our government by the PRESIDENT WILLIAM M'KINLEY uncertainties and perils of the situation caused by the unendurable disturbance in Cuba. I said: "The long trial has proved that the ob ject for which Spain has waged the war cannot be attained. The fire of insurrec tion may flame or may smoulder with vary ing seasons, but it has not been and it is plain it cannot be extinguished by the present methods. The only hope of relief and re pose from a situation which can no longer be endured is the enforced pacification of Cuba. In the name of humanity, in the name of civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests, which give us tlie right and duly to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must stop." In view of all this, the Congress was asked to authorize pad empower the President to take measures to secure a full and final ter mination of hostilities between Spain and the people of Cuba, and to secure in the is land the establishment of a stable govern ment, capable of maintaining order and observing its international obligations,"in suring peace and tranquillity anil proper treatment of its citizens as well as our own, and for the accomplishment of those ends to author ize the military and naval forces of the Unit ed States, as might be necessary, with added authority to continue generous relief to the starving people of Cuba. 

ACTION OF CONGRESS The response of the Congress, after nine days of earnest deliberation, during which the almost unanimous sentiment of your body was developed on every point save as to the expediency of coupling the prepared action with a formal recognition of the re public of Cuba as the true and lawful gov ernment of that island—a proposition which failed o, adoption—the Congress, after con ference, on the 10th of April, by a votcof 42 to 35 in the Semite and .'lll to 6 in the House of Representatives, passed the mem orable joint resolution saying: "First—That the people of the island of Cuba, are, and by right, ought lo be free and independent. "Second—That it is the duty of the I'nited States and the government of the United States hereby demand that the government of Spain at once relinquish its authority in the island of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuban and Cuban waters. "Third—That the President ofthe United States be and is hereby directed and em powered to use the entire land and naval, forces of the United States, the miJitia of the several States to such extent as may he necessary to carry th».ie resolutions into effect. "Fourth—That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to ex ercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over said island, except for the pacification thereof and asserted its determination lhat when that is accomplished, to leave the government and control of the island to its people." This resolution was approved by the ex ecutive on April 20. A copy was at once communicated to the Spanish Minister at this capital, who forthwith announced that his continuance in Washington had thereby becotnt impossible ami ashed lor hi» pass ports, which were given him. He there upon withdrew from Washington, leaving toe protection of Spanish interests in the United States to the French Ambassador and the Austria-Hungarian Minister. Sim ultaneously with its communication to the Spanish Minister, General Woodford, the American .Minister at Mailt id, was tele graphed the confirmation of the text of the joint resolution and directed to communi cate it to the government of Spain with the formal demand that it at once re;ini|ui-!i it.- authority and government in the island ol Cuba and withdraw its forces therefrom, coupling this demand with anrouncemcnts of the intentions of this government as lo the future of the island, in conformity with the fourth clause of the resolution and giv ing Spain until noon of April 2.1 to reply. The demand, although as above shown, < fncially made known to the Spanish en voy here, was not delivered at Madrid. mt "j, ' instructions reached General Woodford, or, the morning of April 21, but before he could present it, the Spanish Minister of State notified him th.:t upou the President's approval Of the joint reeo'u tion the Madrid government, regarding the act as equivalent to an evident declaration of war, had ordered its Minister in Wash mgton to withdraw, threby breaking off diplomatic relations between the two coun tries, and ceasing all official communication between their respective countries. General Woodford thereupon demanded his passports and quitted Madrid the mine day. THE 

CUBAN BLOCKADE Spain, having thus denied the demand of theUnitedStates,and initiated that complete form of rupture of relations which attends a stale of war, the executive power* author ized by the resolution were used by me to meet the enlarged contingency of actual war between Spain and the United Spates. On April 22, 1 proclaimed a blockade of the northern coast of Cuba, including ports on said coasts between Cardenas and Bahia Honda and the port of Cienfuegos on the south coast of Cuba; and on the 23d 1 called for volunteers to execute the pur pose of the resolution. By my message of April 25, the Congress was informed of the situation and I recommended formal declaration of the existence of a state of war between the United States and Spain. The Congress accordingly voted on the same day the act approved April 85, 188S, declaring the existence of such war from an.l including the 21st of April and enacted the approval of the resolution of April 21, di recting the President to use all the armed torce of the nation to carry that act into cf feet. Due notification of the existence of war as aioresaid was given April 25. by telegraph to all the governments with whien the United States maintained relations, in order that their neutrality might be assured during the war. The various governments responded with proclamations of neutral ity, each after its own methods. It is among the least gratifying incidents of the strug gle that the obligations of neutrality were impartially discharged by all, often under delicate and difficult circumstances. In further fulfillment of international duty, 1 issued on April 20 a proclamation announcing the treatment proposed to be accorded to vessels and their cargoes as to blockade, contraband, the exercise of the rights of subjects and the immunity of neutral Hags and neutral goods under (he euemy's flag. A similar proclamation was made by the Spanish government. In the conduct oi hostilities the rules, of tne decla ration of Paris, including abstention from resort to privateering, have accordingly been observed by both belligerents, although neither was a party to that declaration.
