The supreme court of the state of Louisiana has passed upon and pre nounced valid the state asd. municipal laws against cruel' y to animals. That is as it should be. Useful domestic animals should be protected against cruel and unusual punishment and neglect, as much to as children, and usually the bratal biped who abuses quadrupeds will also abuse his wife and children, if cature sbill have been so cruel as to unite a woman to such an unfeeling wretch.

REQUEST Of Many Friends and Patients New Cure Company, HOT SPRINGS, NEW ORLEANS and DALLAS Have Located a New Cure Doctors for Special Diseases A Quick Cure and a Mild and Painless Treatment is Their Motto. The sick in El Paco and Ticinlty who have suffered fcr years at a cost of many thousands of dollars have an op portunity to obta'n tbe combined skill of a staff cf the most renowned special ists in the south and west. The new discoveries employed by this faculty of physicians have worked a new era in medical circles wherever introduced. Thousands of people all over the south and west testify to the merits of these new cure doctors and thir diseovt-ries. Combined specialism solves the great problem how to cure chronic and dif ficult disaases. Tbe principle of a specialist for esch class of disease is the only solution to the question of cur ing difficult diseases. Proficiency can be reached by no other method. In making examinations and prescrib ing, the combined skill and experience of several experts who have been prac ticing medicine from seven to twenty years is of untold value and importance to any one in need of the services of a Ehysiciao. Such a service is guaranteed y the new cure expert special ists. The medical staff, representing the new CURE institute in El Paso are all graduates of leading medical col leges and have spent time in large in stitutions where chronic diseases were specialties. Betides this each have large private experience and have con stantly engaged in this special work for several years. In addition to their own discoveries' and special treatments they are in pos session of all the new deecoveries Church Orchestras. " If tbe Instrument.-1 section in the Baptist chui ch choir h eps on increas ing, there will he a church orcnestra in -own tht will compare very favor ably with similar organizations in much larger cities. There will be six instruments in tbe Baptist choir to morrow night beside the orgao, viz., two violins, one clarinet, one cornet, one horn and a trombone. Prof. Bran nan and Mr. Pollard are tbe viol nists, Mr. Anderson the clarinetist, Mr. Be van the cornet, and Mr. Wigginton plays the trombone. As several other instrumentalists have promised to join After the holidays, there is a promise of having ere long, an orchestra ot over a dozen performers. It has come to be the thing in many places el-e-whera to reinforce the organ with an orchestra, especially where the organ is not a large one, and the effects are invariably pleasiog. The most bash ful and baiting of congregations will let themselves out in sorg where there is such a lead and incentive as is found iu an orchestra. And tben it is a posi tive plea -ure to play in company with so talented an orgtnist as Miss Stout. A featurs of the musical service to morrow night will be a duo between Prof. Braanan with his violin and Miss Stout at tbe organ. The World's Peace Congrecs Washington, December 18.

" I was all run down, blood in terrible condition and I was troubled with a severe scrofulous humor which caused me great Buffering. I took medicine for a long time, but received no permanent benefit. At this time I was working in a general store, and I thought I would look over the medicines and see if I could find some thing that would hit my case. I read an advertisement of Hood's Sarsaparilla and conclu'ded to try it. The first bottle helped me wonderfully and I continued its use until I had taken nine bottles.

The Currency Question Will Require Great Deal of Attention and Deep Study by Congressmen. Washington, D. C.,Dec. 14, 1897. Of course the president's mesaze and the recomnienr'aUous of tbe sec retary of the treasu y o the currency question are th- thi f subjects of discussion in Washington this week. And it may be added that the comment upon them is extremely fvoiable. Aside from a few people wl.o are determined not to be satisfied with anything the pr -sidf nt does, the expres-den of views upon his mrssave and recommend at ons were favorabl" in character and the com mendation of his a' titude on leading questions were in tuch a clear end vigorous terms as to reove no doubt that the band- of Pr sident McKinley are being corr i - .ly l-pht-if' by tbe peo ple of tbe Ui-Hed S.ates 1. respective of party. THE 

CURRENCY QUESTION. On the currency quection the clear cut, concise and pointed recommenda tions are received with marked favor. The president recommends, in brief, that so soon as the revenues of the crovernment equal the expenditures a new system be adopt d by which all United States notes which are redeem ed in gold shall be set aside as a separte fund and not reissued except for go'.d. This process would break the so-called "endless chain" by which the cold has been on former occasions oumDfd out of the treasury. The greenbacks are upon their fae re deemable in gold upon presentation, while the declaration of congress that the nolicv of the government is to maintain all of its currency at par with gold has been looked upon asiadirect lv at least bringing the notes issued under the so-called Sherman act with in that category. Tbe law as it now stands requires that greenbacks, when redeemed in gold, shall be reissued by tbe crovernment in current business transactions, and this of court e -makes it practicable to use them again for drawi 02- more gold out of the treasury thus they become what is popula-ly known as the endl s chain for the con stant withdrawals of gold. Should the president's recoa mer.dat;on be adopt ed, those notes which are rt deemed in cold would not ba reissued, and thua the opportunity for continued with drawais of cold would soon cease. The criticism which is made by tbose de- sirine to criticise this proposition is that it would result in a con' Taction of the currency, because those notes thus redeemed and retained in tbe treasury would not serain go into circulation, and thus the circulation medi -m of the country be practically reduced to that extent. This objection is imet, however, by a further recommendation by the president tnat tne national banks be permitted to if sue currenoy up to tbepar value of the bonds deposit ed as security for their circulation instead of 90 per C3nt of their fae value as at present; also that tbe gov ernment tax upon national bank clrcu lation be reduced to one-balf of one per cent, instead of one per cent a at present It is believed that this, if adopted, would ed the national banks to increase their currency to a greater extent than the reduction in currency which might come from -the retention of the United State njtes redeemed in gold. The national banks at present utilize as a basis for tbe:r currercy less tban one half of the gov 't j. -J : T . u meal noaus uuLSiaouiug. i wuum thus, in case of an increased demand for currency, be practicable for th m to in crease very tna'e-iaUy the amou nt of their currency. Up to tbts time they have utilized only a t-mall proportion of tbe boods available for that purpose. because of the fact that there is not sufficient profit in the issuance of their notes to warrant such action, and if the president s recommendations are car ried out, aid they are permitted to issue notes up to tbe par value of the bones. and the tax upon tbeir currency is re duced, it is believed that it will certainly add to the currency of the country more than any reduction which would follow the retention in tbe treasury of the Uu'ted States notes re deemed in gold. The president also recommends that the banks themselves be required to redeem tbeir own notes in told. Thus by the gradual retire- meat of those obligations of the govern ment upon which gold cai constantly be a em armed and making the obliga tions of the banks payable by tbose banks in gold, tbe foundation is laid for a gradual transfer to the banks of the burden of supplying the gold de manded by the country. The general propo-itioo. which lays tbe foundation for a final retirement of the gold-de mand obligations and transfer of this burden to the banks, as is tbe case in other parts of the world, is 1 oked upon as a simple, plain and easy beginning of a system wblcn win gradually and finally bring the desired result, and do so in a wav which will nt disturb business conditions or require radical action in tbe way of an increase in tbe interest-bearing obligations of the fove-nnient. This view of tbe presi dent's proposition renders it generally acceptible, and results in favorable comment from not only members of bis rarty, but a large element of these composing the opposition parties. THE 

CUBAN QUESTION. The president's expresions upon the Cuban question are also earnestly and warmly reco nmended 1 y members f a 1 1 artiea. The present seofment up on this subject, compared with that of a few montrs ago, is strongly marked and is a hfgn endorsement of the course of the president which he took immediately after his inauguration in the face of much alvtrse criticism, even ia Disown party, xnose wbo a few months ago were critic sing siv agely what they c-nsi .ered anunneces- sarv and improper delay in tbe Cuban matter, now see that the president's course at tnat time was a wise o-e and that has from beginning to end been humane, firm, patriotic and dignified. and one likely to result in honor to the nation and the exercise of human me thods in the neighboring Island of Cu ba. While the final result of th pro position i r autonomy ana oeace in Cuba, which is now in progress, is of course uncertain, it is perfectly clear from the forceful and vigorous utterance of the president upon this subject that any runner action necessary or advis able will not be ne elected, even should it carry its nation to the point of forci ble interference, to prevent a renewal of the cruelties and inhumanities which existed when this administra tion came into power.

LNHAUNT FOR CONSUMPTION AND CATARRH. Dr. Glass is having great success with bis new Inhalant, even in the last stages. Every person suffering from this terrible malady should avail tnem- selves of this opportunity to be cured not relieved but cured. Decor Glass will be here until spring and those people that put themselves under his care until that time will be able to continue treatment alone. A short trial will convince the most sceptical that the treatment will do all the doc tor claims for it. Statistics will how that in the first stages 80 per cer t, itecond stages 60 per cent, third stages 40 per cent can be cured so one can re turn to any climate without a return of tbe disease. All who do not avail themselves of this opportunity to get well are doing a great injustice to themselves as well as their friends. It costs nothing to investigate and be con vinced that the treatment is the great est discovery known for consumption Is is. in fact, a specihc.

UL.ASS. recent statement announcing his can didacy for the democratic nomination for governor of Texas, published in tbe Dal la News of Nov. 27. be sid "I am earnestly of the opinion that the people should countenance and support any reasonable and-proper policy that would tend to secure tbe construction and operation of all kinds of industrial and manufacturing- es tablish menis within tbe etate. Present conditions imperatively demand it. "In the other southern states, not ably in Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, ry many manufacturing enterprises have been . successfully inau curat' d and profitably conducted, converting tbe raw material into the finished product and furnishing remunerative employ ment to labor in many forms. The policy of our p ople, it occurs to me should be to expo-1 the manufactured article rather tban tbe raw material Such a policy would open up and mul tiply tne opportunities ot our own citizens to find profitable employment. and would obviate the necessity o' annually paying many millions of dollars to other communities for what we must bave. "However large the aggregate of our productions in poit oi quantity, our people can not and will not be prosper ous if labor can not find constant and remmerative employment and if tbe money realized from tbe sale of such productions is altogether expended in purchasing from other communities such artices of wear ar d ue as might ba profitably manufactured within our borders. In Georgia there were in 1880 employed in tbe manufacturing estab lishments 24,875 persons. In 1890 the number had increased to 58,380. 'The wa?e account ran from $5,266,- 122 in 1880 to over 17, 000, 000 in 1890, and the value of tbe product was in- cr aed from 936,000,000 to over 58,. 000,000. And notwithstanding the se vere and continued financial depre-'sion since then, an increase in the numb, r of etablismeats. in tbe wage account and in tbe value of products his steadi ly gone on. In South Caroiloa during the lust six months the number of spind'ea has increased from 300 000 to 1,300,000 while many mills of the east have been compelled to shut down on account of the depression in such products.

I can not hink that there is any country where the conditions for successful man ufacturing ente-prisfs are so inviting, and where they would be as proli'ab'e and beneficial to all classes of society a in rexas. w oen we consider the present cost of send-ng the raw mae'il t o'her states and countries for converj sion into tne nnisneu product ana oi returning that product to ourselves for consumption, the drain upon our re sources i-i frightful to contemplate to say nothing of tbe loss to the state in tbe employment of its own citizens in manufacturing pursuits and to tbe farmer in the price of his farm ar d garden products."
