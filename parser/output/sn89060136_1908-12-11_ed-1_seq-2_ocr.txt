It is to the interest of all of us that there should be a premium put upon ■ individual initiative and individual capacity, and an ample reward for i the great directing intelligences alone ; competent to manage the great busi ness operations of to-day. It is well to keep in mind that exactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of 11b i erty and the reactionary the worst enemy of order, so the men who de fend the rights of property have most ' to fear from the wrongdoers of great wealth, and the men who are cham pioning popular rights have most to fear from the damagogues who in the name of popular rights would do wrong -to oppress honest business men, honest men of wealth; for the success of either type of wrongdoer necessarily invites a violent reaction ■ against the cause the wrongdoer nom inally upholds. In point of danger to the Nation there is nothing-to choose between on the one hand the corrup tionist, the bribe-giver, the bribe-tak er, the man who employs his great talent to swindle his fellow-citizens on a large scale; and,- on the other hand, the preacher of class hatred, the man who, whether, from ignor ance or from willingness to sacrifice , his country to hjs ambition, persuades j well meaning but wrong-headed men to try to destroy the Instruments upon which our prosperity mainly rests. Let - each group of men beware of and guard against the shortcom ings tp which that group is Itself most liable. The opposition to Government con trol of these great corporations makes Its most effective effort In the shape of an appeal to the old doctrine of States’ rights. Of course there are many sincere men who now believe in unrestricted Individualism In busi ness, just as there were formerly many sincere men who believed In slavery—that is. in the unrestricted right of an individual to own another individual. 'These paen do not by themselves have great weight, how ever. The effective fight against ade quate Government control and super vision of Individual, and especially of corporate, wealth engaged In inter state business is chiefly done under cover, and especially under cover of an appeal to States’ rights. It Is not at all infrequent to read in the same speech a denunciation of predatory wealth fostered by special privilege and defiant of both the public welfare and law of the land, and a denuncia tion of centralization in the Central Government of the power to deal with this centralized and organized wealth. Of course the policy set forth In such twiiT amounts to abso- nothing, for the first half is nullified by the second half. *The chief reason, hinong the many sound and compelling' reasons, that led to the formation of the National Govern ment, was the absolute need that the Union, and not the several States, should deal with Interstate and for eign commerce; and the power to deal with Interstate commerce was granted absolutely and plenarily to the Cen tral Government, and was exercised completely as regards the only in struments of Interstate commerce known In those days—the waterways, the highroads, as well as the partner ships of individuals who then con ducted all of what business there was. Interstate commerce is now chiefly conducted by railroads, and the great corporation has supplanted the mass of small partnerships or individuals. The proposal to make the National Government supreme over, and there fore to give It complete control over, the railroads and other Instruments of interstate commerce Is merely a proposal to carry out to the Tetter one of the prime purposes, If not the prime purpose, for which the Consti tution was founded. We do not object to the concentra tion of wealth and administration; but we do believe in the distrlbntion of the wealth in profits to the real owners, and in securing to the public the full benefit of the concentrated administrate n. We believe -that with concentration in administration there can come both the advantage of a larger ownership and of a more equit able distribution of profits, and at the same time a better service to the commonwealth. Many laws are needed. There should bo regulation by the National Government of the great Interstate corporations, including a simple method of account keeping, publicity, supervision of the Issue of securities, abolition of rebate* and of special privileges. There should be short time franchisee for alt corporations engaged In poblie business; Includ ing the corporations which get power from water rights. There should be National as well as State guardlan shln of mines and forests There are many matters affecting labor and the status of the wage worker to which I should like to draw your attention, but an exhaustive dis cussion of the problem ia all its as pects is not now necessary. This administration Is nesting, its end; and, moreover, under oar form of government the solution of the prob lem depends upon the action of the States as much as npon the action of l the Nation. Nevertheless, there are certain considerations which I wish to set before you. because 1 hope that our people ’will more and more keep them In mind. A blind and Ig norant resistance to every effort for the reform of abuses and for the read justment of society to modern Indus trial conditions represent* not true . conservatism but an Incitement to the I wildest radicalism; for wise radical ism and wise conservatism go hand 9500,000 For Hebrew Charities.

As ; far as possible I hope to see a frank ! recognition of the advantages con ■ ferred by machinery, organization, . and division of labor, accompanied by an effort to brlr r <* about a larger share in the ownership by wage-work er of railway, mill, and factory. In farming, this simply means that we , wish to see the farmer own his own ! land; we do not wish to see the farms so large that they become the prop i erty of absentee landlords who farm them by tenants, 'nor yet so small that the farmer becomes like a Eu ropean peasant. Again, the depositr ors In our savings banks now number over one-tenth of our entire popula tion. These are all capitalists, who ’through the savings banks loan their money to the workers—that Is, In many cases to themselves—to carry on their various industries. The more we increase their number, the more we introduce the principles of co-op eration Into our industry. Every in crease ip the number*of small stock holders in corporations is a good thing, for the same reasons; and where the employes are the stockhol ders the result is particularly good. Very much of this movement must be outside of anything that can be accomplished by legislation; but leg islation can do a good deal. Postal savings banks will make it easy for the poorest td keep.their savings in absolute safety. The regulation of the national highways must be such that they shall ‘serve all people with equal Justice. Corporate finances must be supervised so as to make It far safer than at present for the man of small means to Invest his money in stocks. There must be prohibition of child labor, diminution of woman labor, shortening of hours of all me chanical labor; stock watering should, be prohibited, and stock gambling so far as possible discouraged. There should be a progressive inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial ed ucation should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium upon thrift, hard work and business energy, but these qualities cease to be the main factors in accumulating a fortune long before that fortune reaches a point where it would be seriously af fected by any Inheritance tax such as I propose. It is eminently right that the Nation should fix the terms upon which the great fortunes are inherit ed. They rarely do good and they of ten do harm to those who Inherit them in their entirety. The President then devotes a chap ter to “protection for wagework ers." He says there should be no pal tering with the question of taking caw of those who become crippled or worn out In our industrial system. He urges proper employers’ liability laws*. He also calls attention to the steps toward providing old-age pen sions that have been taken by many private Industries. He urges Con gress to pass a fcomprehensive em ployers' liability law for the District of Columbia. The President devotes much space to the subject of the courts. First he urges increased pay for our judges and then says: It Is earnestly to be desired that ' some method should be devised for doing away with the long delays which now obtain in the administra tion of justice, and which operate with peculiar severity against persons of small means, and favor only the very criminals whom it is most desir able to punish. These long delays in the final decisions of cases make in the aggregate a crying evil, and a remedy should be devised. Much of this intolerable delay Is due to 1m- . proper regard paid to technicalities which are a mere hindrance to Jus tice. In some noted recent cases this over-regard for technicalities has re-- suited in a striking denial of justice, and flagrant wrong to the body poli tic. At the last election certain leaders of organised labor made a violent and sweeping attack upon the entire judi ciary of the country, an attack coached in such, terms as to include the most upright, honest and broad minded judges, no lesß than those of narrower mind and more restricted outlook. It was the kind of attack admirably fitted to prevent any suc cessful’ attempt to reform abuses of the judiciary, because it gave the champions of the unjust judge their eagerly desired opportunity to shift their ground into a championship of just judges who were unjustly as sailed. Last year, before the House Committee on the Judiciary, these same labor leaders formulated their demands, specifying the bill that con tained them, refusing all compromise, stating they wished the principle of that bill or nothing. They Insisted on a provision that in a labor dispute no injunction should issue*except to protect a property right, dfcd specifi cally provided that the right to carry on business should not be construed sa a property right, and in a second provision their bill made legs! in a la bor dispute any act or agreement by or between two or more persons that would not have been unlawful if done by a single person. In other words, this biii legalised blacklisting and boycotting in every form, legalising, for instance, those forms of the sec ondary boycott which the anthracite coal strike commission so unreserv edly condemned; while the right to News Note* From Mexico.

The demand was made that there should be trial by jury in contempt cases, thereby most seriously- Impair ing the authority Qfjijte courts. Ail this represented of policy which, if carried,<iut£wduld meaj_.thc class privilege fn' Its crudest and most brutal form, and the destruction Of one of the most essen tial function of the judiciary in all civilized lands. The wageworkers, the workingmen, the labqrlng men of the country by the way in Which they repudiated the effort to get them to cast their votes in response to an appeal to class ha tred. have emphasized their sound patriotism and Americanism. The whole country has cause to fee} pride in this attitude of sturdy independ ence, In this uncompromising insist ence upon acting simply as good citi zens, Hs good Americans, without re gard to'fancied —and improper—class interests. Such an attitude is an ob ject lesson In good citizenship to the entire nation. - But the extreme reactionaries, the persons who blind themselves to the wrongs now and then committed by the courts on laboring-men, should also think seriously as to what such a movement as this portends. The judges who have shown themselves a£le and willing effectively to check the dishonest activity of the very rich man who works iniquity by the mis management of corporations, who have shown themselves alert to do justice to the wageworker, and sym pathetic with the needs of the mass of onr people, so that the dweller in the tenement houses, the man who practices a dangerous trade, the man who is crushed by excessive hours of labor, feel that their needs are under stood by the courts —these judges are the real bulwark of the courts; these judges, the judges of the stamp of the President-elect, who have been fearless In opposing labor when it has gone wrong, but fearless also in hold ing to strict account Corporations that work iniquity, and far sighted in see ing that the workingman gets his rights, are the men of all others to whom we owe it ‘that the appeal for such violent and mistaken legislation has fallen on deaf ears, that the-agltation for its passage proved to be without substantial basis. The courts are jeoparded primarily by the action of these Federal and State Judges who show Inability or unwillingness to put a stop to the wrongdoing or very rich men under modern Industrial conditions, and inability or unwilling ness to give relief to men of small means or wageworkers who are crushed down by these modern Indus trial conditions; who, in other words, fail to understand and apply the needed remedies for the new wrongs produced by the new and highly com plex social and Industrial civilization which has grown np in the last half century. There are certain decisions by va rious courts which have been exceed ingly detrimental to the rights, of wageworkers. This la true of all the decisions that decide that men and women are, by the Constitution, "guaranteed their liberty," to con tract to enter a dangerous occupation, or to work an undesirable or impro per number of hours, or to work in unhealthy surroundings, and there fore can not recover damages when maimed in that occupation, and can not be forbidden to work what the Legislature decides Is an excessive number of hours, or to carry on the work under conditions Which the Legislature decides to be unhealthy. There is also, r think, ground for the belief that substantial injustice is often suffered by employes in conse quence of the custom of courts issu ing temporary injunctions without notice to them, and punishing them for contempt of eourt in instances where, as a ,matter of fact, they have no knowWlfge of any proceedings. Outside of organized labor there is a widespread -feeling that this system often'works great Injustice to wage workers when their efforts to better ieir working condition results in- in ustrial disputes. A temporary In junction procured ex parte may as a matter of fact have all the effect df a permanent injunction in causing dis aster to the wageworkers’ side in such a dispute. Organized labor is chafing under the unjnst restraint which comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Its discontent has been unwisely expressed, and of ten improperly expressed, bnt there is a sound basis for It, and the orderly and law abiding people of a commu nity would be in a far stronger posi tion for npholding the courts if the undoubtedly existing abuses could be provided against. Tho power of Injunction is a great equitable remedy, which should on no account be destroyed. But safeguards should be erected against its abuse. For many of the shortcomings of justice In. our country our people as a whole are themselves to blame, and the judges and juries merely bear their share together with the public as a whole. It is discreditable to us as a people that there should be diffi culty in convicting murderers, or in bringing to justice men who as pub lic servants have been guilty of cor ruption, or who have profited by the corruption of public servants. The result is equally unfortunate, whether due to hair-splitting technicalities In the interpretation of law by judges, to sentimentality and' class conscious ness on the part of juries, or to hys teria and sensatlohkllsm in- the daily press. For much of this failure of justice no responsibility whatever lies on rich men as such. We who make up the mass of the people can not shift the responsibility from our own shoulders. But there is an important part of the failure which has speelally to do with inability to hold to proper account men of wealth who behave badly' fIO,OOO Flnq For Talcing Rebates.

The- im mense growth of corporations, of business done by associations, and the extreme strain and pressure of mod ern life, have produced conditions which render the public confused as to who its really dangerous foes are; and among the public servants who have not only shared this confusion, but by some of their acts have in creased it, are certain Judgea. Marked inefficiency has been shown in dealing with corporations and in re-ssttling the proper attitude to be taken by the public not only toward corporations, but toward labor, and toward the so cial questions arising out of the fac tory system, and the enormous growth of our great cities. The huge wealth that has been ac cumulated by a few individuals of re cent years, in what has amounted to a social and industrial revolution/nas been as regards some of these indi viduals made possible only by the im proper use of the modern corporation. A certain type of modern corpora tion, with its olSlcers and agents, its many issues of securities, and its con stant consolidation with allied under takings, finally becom.es an instru ment so complex as to contain a greater number of. elements that, un der various judicial decisions, lend themselves to fraud and oppression than any device yet evolved in the hu man brain. _ Corporations are neces sary instruments of modern business. They have been permitted to become a menace largely because the govern mental representatives of the people have worked slowly in providing for adequate control over them. The chief offender in any given case may be an executive, a Legislat ure or a Judge. Every executive head who advises violent, instead of grad ual,-action, or who advocates ill-con sidered and sweeping measures of re form (especially if they arrrfvinted with vindictiveness, and disregard for the rights of the minority) is particu larly blameworthy. The several leg islatures are responsible fpr the fact that our laws are often prepared with slovenly haste and lack of considera tion. Moreover, they are often pre pared, and still more frequently amended during passage, at the sug gestion of the very parties against whom they are afterward enforced. Our great clusters of corporations, huge trusts and fabulously wealthy multimillionaires, employ the very best lawyers they can obtain to pick flaws In these statutes: after their passage, bat they also employ a class of secret agents who seek, under the advice of experts, to render hostile legislation Innocuous by making it unconstitutional, often through the insertion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping provisions against the interests of the parties inspiring them; while the dema gogues,'the corrupt creatures who in troduce Blackmailing schemes to “strike" corporations, and all who de mand extreme, and undesirably radi cal, measures, show themselves to be the worst enemies of the very public whose loud mouthed champions they profess to- be. Real damage has been done by the manifold' and conflicting interpreta tions of the interstate commerce law. Control over the great corporations doing interstate- business can be ef fective only if' it is vested with full power- in- an' administrative depart ment, a branch of the Federal execu tive, carrying- out a Federal law; it can never bo effective If a divided re sponsibility Is left in both the States and the Nation; it can never be ef fective if I'eft in the hands of the courts to be decided by lawsuits. In no other nation in the world do the courts wield’ such vast and far reaching power as in the .United States. All that is necessary Is that the courts As- a whole should exercise this power with the far Bighted. wis dom already shown by those Judges who scan the future while they act in the present. Let them exercise this great power- not only honeAJy end bravely, hut with wise Insight into the needs and fixed purpoese of the people, so that they may de Justice; and work equity, so that they pud protect aIT persons in their rights, and yet break down the hsrriers ef privilege, which is the foe of right * The President devotes a long chap ter tbkthe sub ject of forests, declaring that if there is one duty which more than another we owe to our children and ottr children’s childrens it ts to have the forests of this country, for they constitute the first and most Im portant element in the-conservation of our natural resources.

The improvement of the ships in every way has been extraordinary, and they have gained far- more experience in. battle tactics than they would have gained it they had stayed in the Atlantic waters. The- American people have cause' foe profound gratification, both in view of the- excellent condition of the- fleet aw sho-wp by this cruise, and In view of the improvement the cruise has worked in this already high' eondf tfian. Ido not believe that theca if mar other service In the world is which the average of character amd efficiency in the enlisted mem £s a? high as is now the case in our ©wn. 1 1 believe that the same statement can be made as to our officers,, taken as a whole; but there must he a reserva tion made in regard to those in the highest ranks —as to which 1 have already spoken—and la regard tc those who have just entered the ser vice; because we do not now get full benefit from our excellent naval school at Annapolis. It is absurd not to graduate the midshipmen as en signs; to keep them for two years in such an anomalous position as at present the law requires i 3 detri mental to them and to the service. In the a-ademy itself, every first class- , 4 man shoulg he required in turn to serve as petty officer and officer; hit ability to discharge his duties as such should be a prerequisite to his going into the linor-and his success in com manding should largely determine his standing at graduation. The Board of Visitors should be appointed in January, and each member should be required to give at toast Mx days’ service, only from one to three days’ to be performed during June week, which Is the least desirable time for the board to be at Annapolis so far as benefiting the navy by their observa tions is concerned.
