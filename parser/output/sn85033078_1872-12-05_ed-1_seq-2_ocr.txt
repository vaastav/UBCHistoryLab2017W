A delegation of Pennsylvanians, headed by the Governor-el cU, Senator Cameron, ex- Congressman O’Neil, and others, to the num ber of about thirty, had an Interview with the President on the 15th, In relation to the appointment of a Postmaster for Philadel phia. They urged the claims of George Trueman, a merchant of that city, lor the place. The President listened attentively, hot gave no definite response relative to the selection. George Fairman, a clerk in the office, was also a candidate. An appoint ment under the Civil Service regulations enters into the cont roversy. A special says that the President was inclined to appoint the clerk, and the delegation was somewhat excited in consequence. The Young Men’s Republican Club of "Washington called upon the President on the 16th, and congratulated him upon his re-election. The President, in his reply to the Informal address, said: “The vote he re ceived was more gratifying to him than the possession of the office.

They allege that a strict enforcement of the rule will exclude many men from holding office who have just claims upon the Be publicans, and who cun creditably fill the cilices for which they apply, but neverthe less cannot pass the Civil Service examina tion. A Washington telegram of the 17th says: “There will be but two changes In President Grant’s Cabinet after the 4th of March next. These will be the retirement of Secretary JFh.h and one other officer.” The following are the remarks made by the 1 ‘resident to the Philadelphia delegation who recently waited upon him to secure the appointment of a Postmaster for Philadel phia of their own selection : <kntt.kmt;n ; H do no! wall m-i- how P would he proper for me to act aside the rule* and regula tions of the (,‘Ull Service Commission.

It was given out in Washington on the DOth. upon the authority of the Administra tion, that the interview of the Pennsylvania politicians with the President, relative to the Philadelphia Post-Office, was of the most pleasant character, and that the dele gation only asked tha If the Civil Service rules were to be disregarded, Truman might Be appointed. To this the Pienident replied that he intended to be a m rned by the civil Service rules in all future appointments. The President is firm in this position.

A “Try: Situate n.—A seat on the bench. Secretary Bel Knap’s Report. Washington, November 8. The annual report of the Secretary of War this year is quite brief. Ho compli ments Congress for such completeness in ■ last year’s legislation that little room is left for legislatives "vmmemlation. The Secretary recommends the establishment of military prisons in places of the pres ent system of sending array convicts to State penitentiaries. Also the enactment of a rode of specific punishments for army officers. Desertions are reported as great ly fallen off in the past year. He renews the recommendation that the extra Major to each regiment he dispensed with as vacancies occur, thus saving a hundred and sixty thousand dollars annually. Head vises raising the intellectual standard of admission at West Point; also the sale of a large number of no.v useless arsenals in the South and elsewhere, and the estab lishment of a general arsenal of construc tion on the Atlantic slope, and another on the Pacific. These arsenals, with that already at Hock Island, in the Mississippi Valley, would efficiently meet the wants of the service in time of need. Progress in experiments with improved navy ordnance, and with breech loading small arms, is slow. He considers channel ob structions and torpedoes, protected by heavy batteries, as valuable for harbor defenses, and experiments with torpedoes have been successful in determining the kind to be used. The Secretary recom mends the storage of torpedoes for de fense of New York and other harbors. Anew system of inspecting disbursing officers' accounts is in full operation. He concludes by regretting that one sixth of the array is still detained in Southern States east of the Mississippi river, but hopes the improving social condition of the country will soon relieve that force for frontier service. Hu says the mili tary expenditures are on u descending scale. The Hurricane in Sicily. The London Times of November 8 has the following account of the hurricane in Sicily, which destroyed the town of Pal az/.010 : ' r licro has leen no instance of such a calamity within the memory of a living man. No earthquake ever caused so much destruction. There are houses ruined, houses fallen to the very ground, the walls cleft from end to end, walls hanging outward as if to rest on the ad joining houses. There are roofs wholly swept away ; sunken vaults and balconies torn from their place; windows and shut ters either entirely carried off, or hanging loose from the walls ; lamp posts forced; from their sockets, and up-rooted trees and this is ail one sees along the northeast side of the town. Not a single house re mains on which the whole roof and win dows do not require thorough repair. Tlie streets are a mass of fragments and rubbish. The incidents of the disaster are so strange as to bo almost incredible. There was a store of twenty-five hectoii tres of wheat, of which not a trace is any, where to bo seen. The books of excise and of the land registry offices have van- Uihed, and only their torn leaves have been found here and there at great dis tances. In one house ail the copper kitchen utensiis were blown through the roof. In another the benches and heavy chests tlew through the windows. The iron bars of one balcony are to be seen curled up one way, and those of another twisted up another way. There is a pil lar of a palace which has been moved one foot without breaking, ami stands up iso lated, all in one picuc, There is a wall of another palace which has fallen back more than three feet without a crack. Here is a beam ol one house which has thrust itself into another house. There is half a bedstead, the other half of w hich lies no one knows where. All the tiles of one building are huddled together in one spot on the roof, crushed ami broken up as small as if they had been pounded. The rafters of another building are all bare. The tiles have flown, no one can see where. In a stable, on the bare ground, men are laying the bodies, one by one, as they are being dug out. Most of 'them are in their night dresses,having been crushed ns they were quietly sleeping. Their fea tures and forms arc so disfigured that one cannot look at them without shuddering. Their nostrils, cars and mouths are stop ped up with earth, and the white dust has everywhere pierced through the skin. Here is the body of a man holding dose to his heart a child, probably his own child, and the skulls of both' are shat tered. There are two young men in eaeli Ollier's arms, probably brothers, and the chests and backs of both are crushed. Near them is another youth covered with blood, who was clerk in a Government office. He ha ' bis eye glass still stuck in his right eye, and was probably reading or writing when he was struck There are some past recognition. Others that seem unhurt, ami look os if they were sleeping. Without exaggeration one-third ot the town is dismantled and more than 1,090 families are literally without a home.

Her n rf> i cious metals have enriched thousands of our fellow citizens, and have proved the maim slay of America in times of national pecuniary embarrassment. Her mining industries have given employment to myriads of mechanics and laborers, '•he is the land of promise to the fortune seeker. But the Golden State has lately sent us anew treasure. Her last nugget is Du. Walker’s California Vinegar Bitters. The health-giving principles contained in this curative are a more precious boon than gold. In all affections of the liver and stomach, remittent anil intermittent fevers, rheumatism, and pul monary diseases, it may be relied upon Asa blood depureat and invigorant it is uneqnaled, purifying tbo circulation and infusing new vigor into tae debilitated I frame. It conquers that most unyielding I of all complaints—dyspepsia, and we know of no other remedy t hat can accom plish this. Its entire freedom from alco-' holic spirit, which retards and neutralizes the effect of any medicine, and which forms the basis of many of the pseudo bitters and tonics, doubly enhances its value to the sick. The papers of the United States vie with one another iu do ing honor to Dr. Walker. We, too, add our voice, and say all honor to the man whose science and skill have enabled him to draw from the vegetable kingdom such a balsam for human suffering. Butter and cheese are almost imlispcnsa- Ile articles of food. Properly used, they are n tuitions and healthy; but an inordinate use of either causes indigestion and dyspep sia. Panm'i Jhirgatint I\l judiciously used, will remove both of these troubles. Have you ague in the face; and is it badly swollen? Have you severe pain in the (Ties;, track, or side?
