The River Press. Vo!. XXXIV. Fort Benton, Montana, Wednesday, December 10, 1913. No. & DISCUSS FARM PROBLEMS Report of Secretary of Agriculture Suggests Several New Plans Washington, Dec. 8.—Reorganisa tion of the department of agriculture is foreshadowed in Secretary Hous ton's first annual report. {Mans for re districting the country for the enforce ment of the pure food law are an nounced and the secretary announces his intention to ask for authority to prepare amendments to the pure food law to improve the food supply, pro tect the public health and promote un iformity in food legislation. Free distribution of seeds by con gressmen should be discontinued, the secretary recommends. He would substitute a constructive work in dis tributing news seeds and plants. Conditions vary widely in the Un ited States, says the report, because farmers do not equally need better credit arrangements and all sections are not similarly circumstanced. The secretary believes there does not ap pear to be need for unique or special legislation, or for legislation that would give the farmer credit on eas ier terms than other members of so ciety. What is needed is the creation of conditions and machinery that will enable him 011 similar credit founda tion to obtain money at the same rates as those that prevail for other classes, and for other localities. As to federal aid for good roads, the secretary says the federal govern ment should deal with the state as Ihe lowest unit through an expert highway commissioner as its agent. The pian should provide for mainten ance as well as construction. Prefer ence should be given to the improve ment oi' roads over which products from the farms can be taken to the nearest railway station. A scheme of road construction and maintenance within a state' should be developed and mutually agreed on. Money ap propriated by the federal government should be apportioned 011 the basis of such factors as total population, farm property, area, taxable valuation and mileage. Would Educate Farmers Washington, Dec. 8.— The house committee on agriculture today fav orbaly reported the agricultural ex tension bill, of Representative Lever of South Carolina, its chairman. Under the measure the department of agriculture would send agents into every farming country in the United States to meet the farmers and give them information acquired as to the result of many years of agricultural experiments. These agents would give particular attention to home economics as well as the improve ment in actual tilling of the soil. Proper administration of the bill, the committee will urge, should make farm life more attractive and profit able, and stop the drift of the popula tion from the country to the city and town. Flood Claims 150 Victims Houston, Tex., Dec. 8.—The number of dead in the flood which lias spread over the lowlands in half a dozen counties in south central Texas reach ed 150 tonight.

Pour-fifths of the dead were negro farm liaçds; many of the ma rooned also are negroes. Cheerfulness Promotes Longevity New York, Dec. 8.— Although cheerfulness is the recipe by which Mrs. Hannah Kosokoff says she has attained the age of 116 years, she constantly lias a burial shroud folded beneath her bed.

A Municipal Christmas Tree Chicago, Dec. 8.—Supported by a thick pole, 75 ordinary sized Christ mas trees will be used in building Chicago's first municipal Christmas tree which will be erected in the lake front in Grant park. Work on the tree began today. A few days before Christmas, the entire tree will be sprayed with water to add a decora tion of ice and its branches wound with festoons of colored lights. Washington News Notes Washington, Dec. 8. — Senator Walsh and Representative Stout have one vacancy apiece to fill at Annapo lis naval academy and so great is the demand for these appointments that they have decided to hold competi tive examination at Helena Dec. 13 open to all applicants. Those mak ing the highest ratings in this examin ation will be appointed. Secretary Lane has awarded the Yellowstone park transportation con tract over the Montana route to F. J. Haynes, Robert Duff and R. W. Mc Tavish, and on terms under which they will reduce their rates from ■ $25 to $20 per passenger on five-day I trips. As a result of the contract the ' secretary proposes to secure propor tionate reductions on four-day and two-day trips through Yellowstone, it having been demonstrated that exist ing rates yield undue profits. Will Eliminate Veal. Portland, Ore., Dec. 6.—The Hotel Men's Association of Oregon, in con vention here today, adopted a resolu tion to eliminate veal from bills of fare in Oregon hotels. The reason given for this action is that the killing of veal for use in hotels will eliminate beef in the future and cause an in crease in the price of meats. The step was urged by leading hotel men in the interests of lower cost of liv ing. Washington News Notes Washington, Dec. 6.—A plan to pro mote road building in western states was embodied in a bill introduced to day by Senator .Warren. It would grant 500,000 acres of public land to each of the following states to be sold for the aid of road building: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mex ico, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming. W. M. Smith and M. N. Stevens of Harlowtown are here for a conference with the commissioner of the general land office to ask that Carey list No. 13, embracing 23,000 acres in the vi cilty of Harlowton, be rejected and that lands embraced therein be thrown open to entry under the home j stead law. These gentlemen say they ! represent settlers residing in the vi I cinity of these lands and contend that . irrigation is not necessary for agri j cultural development, that there is I ample rainfall, and on this ground i they will insist that irrigation would ] be an unnecessary burden upon farm i era. i FLOOD FATALITIES INCREASE i , Loss of Life in Texas Floods May Exceed One Hundred Bryan, Texas, Dec. 6.— Fifty-three persons are known to be dead and scores of others are reported to have lost their lives in the floods which have been sweeping the valleys of the Brazos and Trinity rivers in cen tral and southern central Texas since early in the week.

DIRECT PRIMARIES They May be Adopted by the Repub lican National Committee Washington, Dec. 5.—The issue of j direct presidential primaries, brought I into public discussion by President I Wilson's message, promises to be an , important factor in the deliberations of the republican national committee I here December 16. Many believe con gress may provide primaries before the next presidential election that will do away with the need of any nominating conventions. It was pointed out today that if a direct primary law was passed before the 1916 elections the need for a ! change in the basis of republican rep ] resentation would disappear. I Senator Jones, a member of the I law committee, returned to Washing ! ton today and said plans are going forward for a national convention. "I am in favor of some form of di rect primary," he said. "One plan that appears to be sound would pro i vide for direct primaries in the states, with national conventions in which the delegates would sit in proportion to the vote in the states. Each state would apportion its delegates accord ing to the strength of the respective candidates, and the national conven tion would make the final choice." Senator Cummins, one of the most active advocates-of rules revision, and chairman of the conciliation commit tee appointed in Chicago last spring, said today that discussion of presi dential primaries should not interfere with tlie holding of a special conven tion. : 1 am strongly in favor of direct pri maries," he said, "but there is 110 assurance that a direct primary law will be passed, or at least that, it will not be long delayed." Victims cf Texas Flood Dallas, Tex., Dec. 5.—With the crest of the fiood that has been sweep ing through north and central Texas for the last two days now centered in the Colorado and Brazos rivers at Hearne in the southern part of the state it was estimated at noon today that the death list would total be tween 30 and 40 persons and the prop erty damage amount to about $2,000, 000.

' Conditions are improving rapidly | at points where the water has reced- ; ed. Bryan, Tex., Dec. z>. —The known dead in Texas floods numbered 33 be fore reports from the inundated terri- , tory in this district began coming in [ late today. The late reports were I brought by men on horseback, and in- ! dicated at least 20 more persons had i been drowned. About two-thirds of the dead are negroes. The courier's reports Indicated that ! the property loss would total four or five million dollars, when losses along I the Brazos river are added to the al ready heavy damage in other portions of the state. Not His Picture San Francisco, Dec. 5.—When Rich ard Buchanan, a hotel clerk, received word over the long distance telephone from Iiis mother in Los Angeles today that a morning newspaper had pub lished his picture as a suspect in the train robbery near that city last Mon day night, when E. H. Montague, a Southern Pacific traveling passenger agent, w'as shot, he hastened to Cap tain Mooney of the detective bureau to establish his innocence. After lis tening to Buchanan's story, and com paring with him the description of the train bandit sent out from Los Angeles, Captain Mooney decided there was no reason why he should hold the man, particularly as the Los Angeles police had made no such re quest. Buchanan lias been working in this city for a year and a half, and he said he had plenty of alibis to prove that lie was here the night of the train rob bery. When told Ills picture publish ed in Los Angeles was said to have been taken from the rogue's gallery, and to be that of a man who served a jail sentence there in 1910 under the name of R. Buchanan, he declared that he was in Texas in 1909-10.

TEXAS F LOOD DISTRICT North and Central Counties Suffer From Swollen Rivers Dallas, Texas, Dec. 4. —Rainfall con tinued today in the Rood districts of central Texas, adding to the menace of the waterways which have already cost 13 lives and about $17,000,000 property damage. The most impor tant new point affecteO today was San Antonio. The floods cover portions of nearly every county from San Anton io northward and eastward to include all the important cities of north and central Texas. The homeless numbered thousands today but as they were divided in small groups throughout the immense flood territory, no serious relief prob lems were presented. At Belton bas kets of provisions were propelled on the telephone wires to rood victims. Near Marlin 175 passengers on« a Houston and Texas Central railroad train were marooned all night. The flood water rose over the rails until it reached the lower steps of the coaches. Marlin was overflowed by water from the Brazos river bed. The Brazos is ten miles wide at some points.

I hesitate to participate In it, for 1 do not want to give it, before the coun try the color of actual deliberation. I cannot believe the American people will for a long period tolerate this legislation by a caucus." Senator Iteed declared that the im pression had gone abroad that Presi dent Wilson had exerted some undue "influence" in congress in the cur rency matter. "The president," s^id Senaijr Reed emphatically, "has never attempted to coax or coerce congress into pass ing any particular bill. I deny that the president has gone a hair's breadth beyond the performance of his constitutional duty." Edict Against Tickling Plumes Chicago, Dec. 4.—Horizontal plumes aigrettes, pompoms and other like adornments, which are worn on wo men's hats and which tickle the faces of people on the streets and in street cars must not be worn in Chicago. This edict was issued yesterday by Mayor Carter H. Harrison. If necessary to stop what he con siders a nuisance the mayor is in favor of an ordinance similar to the one compelling women to remove their hats in theaters. The plumes are not objected to, said the mayor, but the manner in which they are worn must be discontinued. The per pendicular plume was given the offi cial stamp of approval. Accused of Land Swindle Kansas City, Dec. 4.—An alleged land fraud which, according to post office inspectors, was conducted in several states through the medium of moving picture shows and the United States mails, led to the arrest here today of W. B. Emrich and N. H. Spit er of Louisville, Ky. The two were arraigned before a United States commissioner on a charge of misuse of the mails. According to the federal charge tickets were distributed among the spectators at picture shows and the announcement was made that the holders of "lucky" numbers would be given a deed to a lot In Guernville, Sonoma county, Cal. It is alleged that the "lucky" ones were then re quired to pay more for the filing of papers than the lots were worth. Test Income Tax Law Chicago, Dec. 4.—Charges that the income tax feature of the new tariff law constitutes class legislation and is unconstitutional were made today in a test suit filed here against the Continental & Commercial Trust & Savings bank on behalf of Miss Elsie De Wolfe of New York. The plaintiff alleges that the in come tax is not uniform and that the law is therefore unconstitutional, be cause it is imposed 011 only 423,000 in a population of some 90,000,000 and the persons that would have to pay the tax have not consented to its im position; the tax violates the elements of equality in its graduated scale of taxation. Women Besiege Capitol Washington, Dec. 3.—The suffrage convention was suspended for a few hours today while delegates moved on the capitol to urge a ravorable report by the house rules committee on res olutions to create a standing commit tee on women suffrage in the house. The scene resembled a charge on a citadel when more than 1,000 suf frage delegates closed In on the cap ital. The women advanced in regi mental formation in quick step order and crowded the hearing room long before the committee arrived. Mann Expects War Washington, Dec. 3.—During the de bate in the house today on the Hay bill for raising volunteer forces in time of actual or threatened war, Re publican Leader Mann, said: "I don 't see any escape from chaos and anarchy in Mexico under the plan we are now pursuing. If this situa tion runs on very long it means war. I hope we avoid trouble with Mexi co." Washington News Notes Washington, Dec. 3.—A permanent p ublic holiday on June 17 in each year to be called National Road day, was proposed in a bill by Representative Ferris of Oklahoma. Representative Byrnes of South Carolina and Ste phens of Mississippi introduced bills for good road appropriations. The house committee en postoffices today favorably reported a bill to raise from $100 to $1,000 the maximum amount that an individual may deposit in a postal savin:;,-, bank in one month. The excess over $100 would not bear interest. Congress is asked to appropriate just $1,108,081,777 to operate this gov ernment of the United States in the fiscal year according to estimates pre pared by each department and sent to the house by Secretary McAdoo. Senator Burton today introduced a b ill for a central bank to be owned by the public and operated by the gov ernment, with twelve branches. Its power® would be similar to those vest ed in the regional banks by tiie admin istration bill.
