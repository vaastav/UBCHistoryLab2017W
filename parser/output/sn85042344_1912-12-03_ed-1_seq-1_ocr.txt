I.- Tln great Harrlman morger created when the Union Pacific railroad company bought it per cent of the stock of the BouiAern Pacific railway system, was split aaundar today by the su preme court of the United Btatoa m a violation of the Sherman anti-trust law. Then with the end Of the mem- er before It, the court sent forth l' declaration that "while the law rvoy not be abli in enforce competition, it tun rtarii combinations which rend' er competition Impracticable." justice Day announced the unani mous, opinion of the court. Justice Van Deventer took no part In the eon ilderatloh of the oass today but bin national finding when he was a Judge of the I'lah circuit court, to tho ef fect that the two mads were not coni petltora and therefore no violation of the law had resulted from the pur ohaae, was reversed and annulled, m etead of following the reaaonlng of JUltii e Van Deventer, In the court be low, the court In unbalance approved the minority holding of fudge Mook, that the roads were competitor! and that It was Just aa much a violation of the law for one road to buy th" controlling stock of a competitor Ri ii was for a holding company, us In the Northern Securities ease, to buy the controlling stock of two compet ing companies. As the Northern Be urltiea company plan fulled nearly ten years ago, so the Harriman plan Ml today, iuj Appoint Receivers. The circuit court for the district f Ctah. was directed to supervise the separation rf the two great roads af ter hearings and in emergency to a i polnt n receiver to sell the stocs. The Union Pacific, if the circuit court sees proper, may retain control of the old Central Pacific line from Ogden to San Francisco. The decision of the lower court, that there was no violation of the law in the attrmp' to acquire the then Fa IfiO stock and he stock of the Atchison, Topexa inn Santa Fe railway company, afterwar d abandoned, and a certain Intertst :n the San Pedro, Los Angeles and SMI Lake railroad company, was allowed to fdnnd. It Is the general belief here ibat the application of the decision to Hie railroad situation of the country will be widespread, placing a powerful precedent In the hands of the ait Ir ney general to prevent consolidation of competing roads. Department of Justice of flout is. however, were not prepared tonight to discuss the full effect of the dc;-. alon. Attorney General Wtekeraham elated over the outcome, Issued n statement In which he simply declar ed that the i ase extended principles of the Northern Securities case and reaffirmed those of the Standard Oil and St. I.ouls Terminal association cases. BujkmI on Standard ( use. Justjce Day In his opinion firs' deult with the law In the case. He spoke of the Standard Oil and Tobac co cases of last year as the final au thority on the Interpretation of th Sherman anti-trust act. He pointed to the decisions of the Standard oil and Tobacco cases aa being approv ed in those oasei and then proceeded to apply to this merger the principles dlSCUSSed In all those decisions. "W'o take it, therefore." ho said In this connection, "that It may be re garded as settled that a combination which places railroad! engaged In In terstate commerce in SUCh relation RI to create a single dominating control In one corporation whereby natural and existing competition in Interstate commerce Is unduly restricted or sun presied Is within the . ondemnntlon of the act While the law may not ha able to enforce competition, it DM reach combinations which render combination Impracticable. "Nor do we think it ran make any difference that Instead Of resorting to a holding company as was done In the Northern Sc. .irltlc case, the con trolling Interest In the slock of one corporation is transferred to the oth er. The nomination and OOtltrol una the power to suppress competition are acquired in the case no less than In the other and the resulting mis chief at which the statute was alrr ed Is equally tffecUVI which,", er f rni is adoled."
