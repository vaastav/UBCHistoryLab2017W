A synopsis of the document is follows : To the Cpngrenn of the United Staten: The assemblage within the halls of those charged aking laws for the benefit of a go and free people, impressively suggests tho fling obligation and inexorable isibility involved in their task.

The commission organized under the convention which we had entered into with Chili for the settlement of tiie ding claims of each government against tiie other, udjou Die period stipulated lor its continuance, leaving undetermined a number of Ameri ases which had been duly presented. These claims are not barred and negotia nt progress for their submission a new tribunal. A gratifying recognition «if the impartiality of this cm foreign states was manifested by the cident request of tho Chinese overnments that tho ageutsof the United sshouht, witli proper limits, afford inflection to the subjects of the other dur ng tho suspension of diplomatic relations due to a state of accepted and a misapprehension which " ' belie! ihut in affording this kindly unofficial protection of « agents would exercise the same demands for administrative reforms in Corea; but the unhappy precipitation of actual hos tilities defeated this kindly p . Deploring the destructive war between the two most powerful of the eastern nations, and anxious that our commercial interests in those countries may he pre served. and that the safety of there shall not be jeopardized, I wouid hesitate to heed any intimation that friendly aid for the honorable termination of hostilities would be acceptable to both belligerents. The German government lias protested »gainst that provision of the c tariff act which imposes a discriminating duty of one-tenth of one cent a pound augurs coming from countries paying port bounty thereon, claiming that exaction of such duty is in contravention of Articles 5 and 9 of tho treaty of 1828 with Prussia. In tiie interests ot the commerce of both countries, and to even the accusation of treaty violation.! recommend the repeal of so much of the itatuto as imposes that duty.

INCIDENT. Prominent mg (lie questions of the was tlie Blue fields incident, in wiiat Strip is known bordering within the jurisdictif the treaty of 18(50, bet we and Nicaragua, the former government recognized the sovereignty of the latter over the strip, and a limited form of self-government was guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians, to be exercised according to their customs, for themselves and other dwellers within its limits. The so-called native government, which grew be largely made up of aliens, for many years disputed the sovereignty of Nica ragua over t he strip, and claimed the right to maintain therein a practically inde pendent municipal government. Early ' he past year efforts of Nicaragua t< tain •overeignty over the Mosquito terri tory led to serious disturbances, culminât tho suppression of the native ernment and the attempted substitu •aoticablo composite admi isiratlon.il) which Nie; residents were to p followed by an insurreeth time, subverted Nicaraguan rule,expel ling lier officers and restoring t he old orguniza gavo place to the exist ing local government established and up held by Nicaragua.

Our naval commanders at the scene of these disturb ances, by their constant exhibition of firmness and good judgment, contributed largely to the prev consequences and quiet and order. I regret that in the midst of these occur ences there happened a most grave and ir ritating failure of Nicaraguan justice. An Amoricun citizen named Wilson, residing a, in the Mosquito Territory, was ed by one Argiiello, the acting guv »r of the town.

The purpose of Congress does , therefore, seem to be fully attained by the existing condition. While able increase i oonsider the ar policy of sea coast fortification, in the prosecution of which we have been steadily engaged for some years, has so far d veioped so as to suggest that tiie eficclh strength of the army now be equal to the legal strength. Measures taken by tho department «luring the year indicated have already considerably augmented the effective force, and tiie Secretary of M ar presents a plan, which I recommend to tiie consideration of Con gress. to attain the desired end. Economies effected in the department in other lines of its work will offset to a great extent the expenditure involved in tiie propositi« submitted. Among other things this eo templates the adoption of tiie three battal ion formation of regiments, which lor several years has been endorsed by the .Sec retary of War and the generals cotunrand y.Compact in itself,it provides a skeleton organization, ready to be filled •■ar, which is peculiarly adapted to our strength and requirements; d the fact that every other nation, with a single exception, has adopted tliisf« litions of modern w fare, should alone secure for the recom mendation an early consideration. It is hardly necessary that in obedience Constitution de les all the fact the commands of the d the laws and for me pur V ose of protecting tne property of the Tiited States, «filing the process of Federal and removing lawless obstructions the performance by the government of its leeitimatA functions, it became fn variou.-i localities during the year to employ a considerable portion «)f the regular troops. Tho duty was «Ü3charged promptly, courageously and with marked discretion by the officers and st, gratifying proof that the army deserved that complete lidence in its ullioiency ami discipli which the country bus at all times mani fested. The President recommends the teni ivnl of the grade of lielitonant i behalf of General John M. just und gracious , and the thus afforded porary general i Schofield, retired, a l. ME 

COUBT. The report of the Attorney-General, the President says, notes the gratifying pro gress made by the Supreme Court in over coming the arrears of its business and in reaching a condition in which it will be uble to dispose of cases as they ari any unreasonable delay. This result, is, of course, very largely due to the cessful working of the plan inaugurating circuit courts of appeals. In respect to those tribunals the suggestion is made in quarters entitled to the Highest considera tion. that an additional circuit judge for each circuit would greatly strengthen these courts and the confidence reposed in tiieir adjudications, and that such an addition would not create greater force of judges than the increasing business of such courts requires. I commend the suggestion the careful consideration of the Congress. The permanent solution of the Indian problem is probably not to be expected at once, but meanwhile such ameliorations of present conditions as the existing system will admit of ought not to be neglected. satisfied there should bo a Federal court established for the territory with suilicicnt judges and that this court should dthin the territory and have the same jurisdiction us to territorial affairs now vested in the Federal courts sitting i Arkansas und Texas. Ith 

REORGANIZATION. Another subject of pressing moment ferml to by tho attorney-general is irganization of the U ' ** way Company. the lie Kail basis equitable garils all private interests and as favorable to the government as existing conditions will permit. The operation of a railroad through a receiver is by auoniu of things which should bu terminated on all grounds, public ami >rivato, at the earliest possible moment, lesides not tu enact the needed enabling legislation at the present session postpones the whole matter until the assembling of 1 evitably increases all plications of the situation, and lmt be regarded as a signal fail ure to solve a problem which has practi cally been before the present Congress e organization. lotir a new Congress t he could

The ascertained revenues of the last v basis of calculating for the current year, will he correspondingly greater, though the I'm latest indications are so favorable that lie confidently predicts an increase of at least 8 per cent in the revenues of tiie year over those of (he last year. The ex penditures increase steadily and sarily with tiie growth and needs of the country, so that the deficiency is irrealer or less in any year depending upon the Volume of receipts. The Postmaster-general states that this deficiency i obviated at upon mail modified.

With reference to the report of the Sec retary of tho Navy, the Jprosidcut says: show i le through the 5 NAVY.

The vigorous action of Reur Admiral Ben hum protecting the personal and commer citizeus during tho dis turbed conditions afforded results which will, it is believed, have a far-reach in;; and wholesome influence wheuever in like circumstunces it may become necessary for concentrated cial rights of naval commanders to interfere on be foreign ports. The ow in progress between China ami Japan has rendered it necessary or expedi dispatch eight vessels to those waters. I feel it my imperative duty to call at tention to the recommendation of the Secretary in regard to the personnel of tho line of the navy. The stagnation of pro in this the vital branch of tho service, is ho great as to seriously impair its efficiency. I consider it of t he utmost importance that the young and middle aged officers should before the eve of re tirement, be permitted to reach a grade entitling them duty. The system adopted a few years ago regulating the employment of labor at the navy yards is rigidly upheld and has fully demonstrated its usefulness and expe diency. It is within the domain of Civil Service Reform, inasmuch as workmen ployed through a Hoard of Labor selected at each navy yard, and are given work without refereuco to politics and in the order of their application; preference, however, being given to army and navy and those having loriner navy half of people i pc and important yard experience. PRESERVATION The President endorses the rccomi dation of tiie äecretury of tho Interior that adequate protection be provided d that d S Jp .* necessary to protect the „ _. ..I should bo pro of the opinion that there abandonment of the policy sanctioned by present laws under which the government, for a very small consid eration, is rapidly losing title tracts of land covered with timber which should be proprtyy reserved as permanent sources of timber supply. for a comprehensive forestry ay; gurated. Such keepers be in tendents as forests already vided. I should be convinced that the prof of the ludiun probli rery step taken in that direction depend a very large extent upon the intelligence d honesty of the reservr tiie interest they have in their work. Aq agent fitted for his place can do much epariug the Indians under his charge for citizenship and allotment of their lands, and his advice as to any mat ter concerning their welfare lead. An unlit agent will make no effort advance the Indians on his reserv vard civilization of preparation for al lotment of lands in severalty, and his their condition in this und other regards is needless and valueless. The indications are that the detail of army officers as Indian agents will result in improved management on the tions. solution gents and • •: I ■ill no

The accusation that pensou frauds is evidence of friendliness towards our worthy v ami a denial of their claims to the gener osity of the government, suggests an un fortunate indifference to the commission of any offence which lias for its motive the securing of a pension and indicates a willingness to be blind to the existence of and treacherous crimes which play upon demagogic fears und makes sport of patriotic impulse of a grateful people. mini tiered pc-: and tho head room for the clai gation of our p that cot)tinned sion rolls was 1 vigilance and necessary to the effort TLTUItAL EXPERIMENTS.

Another impairment « fund caused thereby to be made good fro the immediate available cash assets of said bank, and if these should be insuffici impairment to lie made good by pro assessment among the other banks, their contributions consisting of first, lien upon the assets upon the failed bank in favor of the contributing banks.
