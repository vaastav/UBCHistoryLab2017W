FOLKS CRITICISING CONGRESS The new congress opens tomorrow and returning statesmen say the peo ple are not pleased with what Con gress has so far done. According to certain of the legisla tors who are back a great many vot ers are displeased with the taxation bill and particularly by the annuonce nent of Republican leaders that it is but a "makeshift or temporary meas ure," and that another bill, bringing ore unceriainiv miisr enmp a nnir in a few months. Both the corpora- tions and the small tax payer alike, find much in the tax bill to criticize, according to legislators who have been "back home." Another element is displeased & "' i oonus Dili wniie just around tne cor ner may be still another element dis- pleased because there is talk of re viving that same soldier bonus. Con gress is being "cussed" because it Tiasn't passed a tariff law; because it had done nothing as yet about J! till l . . . uiiuiug pin; Decause it appears to have economized but little in the ap propriation bills. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE President Harding's message to Congress today deals with a number of important problems. He comes out tlatfooted for co-operative mar keting, and thus lends his assistance to what is known as the Agricultural moc in the House and Senate who , are determined to secure remedial legislation for the farmers. He insists that the foreign debt shall be funded, and thus sets at rest the talk in some quarters that we should give the foreign nations the $11,000,000,000.00 we loaned them during the war. Some of our for eign debtors, as wellas a few peo ple in this country, fvor the cancel lation of these debts on the ground that the European couatries helped to fight our battles and that it was our fight as much aV theirs. They forget that if it had not been for the money and soldiers of tlfe United States the whole of Europe would have been under German dominion today, and they would have been pay ing a great deal more tribute to Ger many, and for years to come than they will ever pay the United States. Any attempt to cancel these debts wo ild have met with stern opposi tion on the part of the American peo- pie, who are carrying quite enough of the public debt, ahdare looking forward to the interest "on the for eign debt to help lighten their bur dens. Again there is the soldier's bonus, and Senator Simmons has sug- help our soldiers and : sested d vhat t he interest on this debt thus demonstrate some appreciation on the part of the government to ' wards the men who saved the coun try and the world. As long as there ijc and jljan e-' iilts in ex-service man or his depend- need of assistance, there should never he any thought of a cancellation of the foreign debt, since Mr. Harding says we can't pay it out of the treasury on account I of lack of funds. ; The President is very optimistic ' as to the outcome of the Armament conference. It is true the President has made progress as regards naval reduction, but until there is some common agreement, between nations and the elimination of the troubles on land, there will never be any great reduction in the size of the armies of Europe. Germany demonstrated that she could do a great deal of mischief on land with her armies, while her fleet was bottled up. The only way to secure peace is move the cause of war. to re-. 1 I MAY RE A

For a hundred years or more Ire land has been clamoring for home rule, and this question has come up at intervals in the English parlia ment in one form or another. The greatest drawback to home rule has been the landed gentry of Ireland who are in many instances Englishmen, and Ulster, a part of jAonn jreiana, who has always evin-. .,,,.. . . ced a desire to be identified with England, just as the other English j j colonies, and upon the same basis, i j Ulster has her parliament and Eng-p ; land was willing to give south Ire- i'land her parliament and government i under the liberal protection of the shall t British Isles. The conferences looking to a sct-!to tlement of the question followed i nmnfhQ r.f nii-n vra-r in xv-liirb a crool! great j many Irish people and British con- j Istabularv were slain anrt mtwh Tirnr- r-'ertv destr0yei. According to this arrangement Ul ster is connected with the coalition government and is given the alterna tive of- remaining with the all Irish government if she chooses. Jf she does not choose to remain with South Ireland in one. government. Ulster ihas the alternative of - calling for boundary lines which will separate. her from South Ireland, and this will quite naturally result in two govern-! ments in that country, Ulster has all along objected to joining with South, Ireland in one gov eminent for the country, holding the opinion that South Ireland is incap able of self government. She feels that South Ireland will become so deeply involved in debt on account of mismanagement that she will tax the ; industries of Ulster or North Ireland tothe point of bankruptcy. In oth er words she feels that North Ire lad will be compelled to support the government of South Ireland. COTTON PRODUCTION ... INCREASES HERE (Continued From Page One.) ton last year planted his entire crop at this variety this year, and so far as-1 have ben able to ascertain they wilj all jdo the same next year. This cotton on the average will make 10 per cent more per acre than the ordinary mixed varieties commonly planted throughout the county and it is worth 1-2 to a cent more per pound than the shorter sta ples. Figuring thus, we have an In creased production of around 150 bales and one cent in price on a thousand uuies wtucn amounts to when cotton is sold at 16e per pound ubout 121.000.

Mr. S. P. Waldo, a well known business man of Kenly. was killed Saturday night in an unusual acci dent. Mr. Waldo had left a" Kenly barber shop and was on his way to his home about half a mile distant. Evidently he stumbled and fell in a ditch by the road way a sharp snag by the roadway piercing his forehead and neck. Probably the blow on the forehead caused his death. A neighbor found the lifeless body of Mr. Waldo early Sunday morning. Mr. Waldo's family missed him Satur day night and searched for him, but were unable to find him. There are no lights in Kenly and it is believed in the darkness Mr. Waldo missed his footing and stumbled by the roadside. The darkness prevented his body be ing found before morning. The deceased was 4 8 years of age. His wife and nine children survive. He is ali-o survived by his mother, Mrs. A. M. Waldo of Cary; two sis ters, Mrs. John Brothers of Cary and Mrs. Geo. Rood of Fort Haywood, Va., and a brother, Mr. N. R. Waldo, who conducts a meat shop in Wilson. ANN'OTHER CAR LOAD ASBESTOS SHINGLES. jis being unloaded here today by T. F.
