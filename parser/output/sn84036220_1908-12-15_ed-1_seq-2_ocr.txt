We have carefully refrained from indulg ing in exaggeration, preferring to let the plain facts tell the story of our material progress. At some future date, we hope to get out a special edition which will be a credit to the county. It will contain the most com plete history of Fergus county yet published. It will tell of her early growth, the development of her my riad resources, of the men most in strumental in bringing about this de velopment and of the things the fu ture reasonably holds in store for us. The present issue is simply an in cident in the work of getting out one of the best weekly newspapers in the northwest. We could do the same next week and next, if condi tions warranted. It calls for no un usual effort on the part of our com plete force and equipment, it is but an indication of the preparedness of the Fergus County Democrat to meet conditions as they arise. We hope to improve with every issue of the paper during the coming year and whenever business conditions in the city and county demand some radical advance in the publishing business here, the Democrat stands ready, prepared with the men and the machinery, not to mention the confi dence, to give what is desired. 

REPUBLICAN DISSENSION. Anaconda Standard: All Gaul was ■divided into three parts, and so, too, once upon a time wast the whole world. Augustus Caesar, Antony and Lepidus each taking a third. Unfor tunately, Montana's vote for the suc cessful presidential electors cannot be legally trisected in any such a way, else Messrs. McCormick, Warren and Gallick could all go to Washington, each bearing an equal share of the returns. Regretablc indeed is it that the trip should be a theme of discord and dissension. The three electors will meet in Helena Januarv 10, to try to decide to which belongs the honor. When shall these three meet again? Never, if they don't patch up their differences and do some tall Al phonse-Gastoning. "Behold," said Soloman, "how good and how pleas ant it is for brethren to dwell togeth er in unity!" And behold how differ ent it is when brethren can't even meet in harmonv and trinity. The rule of three is not the rule in this case; much less, it seems, is there to be any application of the golden rule. McCormick, Warren and Gallick. these three; tnd the greatest of these is—which ? The corning year will be a busy one in Fergus county. From present indications, a record breaking crop of wheat will be harvested, new mills for turning out gold bricks are to be erected, a general forward movement in every industry wild be made. Hun dreds of settlers arc coming to find homes in the best country on earth and prosperity such as no section of our great country has ever experi enced should be the portion of the matchless Judith Basin. A dispatch from Moore states that four tons of sapphires were shipped from that place last week by the New Mines Sapphire Syndicate of Yogo. According to jewelers, Fergus county sapphires are second only to dia monds in beauty and value. There is not another country in the world# that ships such precious gems as sapphires out in four ton lots but the Inland Empire has the habit of leading the world in everything she does. Congress has appointed a commit tee to consider the "insult" placed upon that august body by President Roosevelt in his last message. The said "insult" was a paragraph where in the President complained because he is not permitted to use the secret service men to ferrit out crookedness perpetrated by congressmen. Sic 'em, Teddy; sic 'em Congress. Let your children retain their il lusion of good old Santy Claus. It gives their imagination something to play on. It provides them with the greatest joy of which mankind is heir, that of expectation, for several weeks. The deceit can do them noth ing but good. By all means, let the youngsters have their Santy as long as possible. For the benefit of our juvenile read ers, and there are several thousand of them in Fergus county, we will say that a special message from Old San ty to the Democrat says that Lewis town will be one of the first places visited one week from Thursday even ing and that every little one in Fer gus county is to be remembered. A new paper is to be established very shortly at Stanford. We take pleasure in wishng the newcomer well in advance of its appearance, but might say that papers may come and papers may go but the Fergus County Democrat- will continue to be favor ite weekly newsgiver of the great In land Empire. Four hundred thousand dollars ■worth of new buildings erected in one year is a record seldom reached by a city of 3,500 people. Very naturally, Lewistown, the best town in the United States, is the one to make such a record. A careful perusal of the advertise ments to be found in this issue of the Democrat will materially assist you in the task of selecting your Christ mas presents. Speaker Joe Cannon says that there ■will be no bonds issued to deepen our rivers in order that they be made navigable. And there you are.
