The friends of Harlem Tommy Murphy are anxious to see what kind of a showing he will make at San Francisco tonight in his bout with Willie Richie. In view of Murphy's poor exhibition with Patkey McFarland here recently, Ritchie, on the form he displayed against Cross, should win without extending himself. In that event he would find it worth while to meet Cross again in a long er battle. It Is doubtful, however, if Ritchie will come east again until af ter the first of the new year, unless Manager Gibson can arrange a match with him in Madison Sauare Garden after the sixday bicycle race which begins next Saturday midnight.

The plan to them seem ed feasible and if they are success ful and tho election can be held by citizens who will sacrifice one day's pay in behalf of the good roads movement, there is little doubt in the minds erf many but what the bonds would carry by a big majority and tiie proceeds spent in con .structing permanent roads. The question of working state con victs on the reads was discussed and it was the opinion of the commis sion! rs that it should be done and above all tdse make every mile of road built permanent; one that would be passable at all times of I I DEATH WOMAN V CORONER'S JURY RETURNS VER DICT A MISSING NEIGHBOR WOMAN IS SOUGHT. i'.irant, Okla., Dec. 1.
