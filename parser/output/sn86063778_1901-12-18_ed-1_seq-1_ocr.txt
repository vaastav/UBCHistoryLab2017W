Mr. Carnegie also wants the new university to take the lead in original research, ro that the United Ktat"s can eventually stand side by Bide with Cermeuy, if not excel that nation, in scientific development.

Only Kffteetlre Method ( Dealing: TTltU ftnerlllae, It I* Aenerted, and Man j More Trnopii Are Needed. London.?A correspondent of the Times. wiring from Pretoria, say* much remains to be done in the way of partitioning the country by means If? ~ m 4 lu> <11 ill ftfiuiit iiuunra i/ui uiu nu' British mil hope effectually to clear the Boers away from the large districts of the Eastern Transvaal. It is found that block houses a mile or more apart are useless in preventing the passage of Boers at night when they are determined to cross. Nothing short of block houses six or seven hundred yards anart and connected by means of formidable wire ? : tangleiuents will prove effective. To thread the count"y In this way. says the correspondent, requires time and men. but In the opinion of the military authorities It Is the only method of dealing with an enemy who refuses to tight and adopts guerilla . tactics. The British public must therefore be patient. North of the Delagon Railway line, the dispatch goes on to say. the Boors are momentarily free from the presence of the British columns. Tho mountain ranges afford endless hiding places for the enemy, supplies are plentiful. and wheat, which llnds its way nil over the country, is carefully concealed for future use. It is impossible to avoid this unless the Boers are kept moving, and to effect this many more troops are required. The most notable development In the Orange Itiver Colony is the concentration under I>e Wet, south of Iieilbron. of 1000 men. CASHIER TAKES SIC.0.003.

The notable i circular note addressed by Secretary . Hay, on July 3, to all the Powers concerned In the adjustment of the Chinese troubles was never departed 1 from by the diplomatic otlieers through whom It was transmitted, Mr. Kockliill says, and he adds: "Bearing these instructions in mind the task of the agents of our Olovrrn- ' ment in l'ekin was a comparatively < easy one. Throughout the negotiations i our object was to use the influence of our CJovernnient in the interest of Ju-?tiee and moderation and in a spirit , of equal friendship to the Powers ne- J gotlating Jointly with us and the Chi- | ucse Nation."

PROUD OF MORGAN. Bill Arp Says Alabama Senator Is a Great Mao. HE IS AN OLD MAN ELOQUENT. Then Arp Talks About Great Men Georgia Mas Produced - Paper Read At Warm Springs. As I lokod upon the likmc* of General Morgan that graced the Nicarauga headlines in The Constitution I could not help "aying to myself. "There is a great man. 1 pray that ho may live to see the canal completed and bo the honored guest of the boat that makes the flrst trip across from ocean t.. ocean." It looks like Providence roared him up to champion that great work and has preserved him in health and devotion until at last the b.Il has passed and all obstacles are removed. I know that he is happy and f?eis serenely triumphant. If 1 was an Alabaman. I would fee! proud of Morgan. If 1 was a Tennessean. I would feel proud, for ho was born there and there spent ten years of his youth. Hut I am proud of him anyhow, for he is a Southern man and all his long publiclife has been unselfish and true to his people. His good health and well preserved faculties encourage me to live on and cn just as long as 1 can. for he is just two years older than 1 am and is stil vigorous a\jd useful, l'^ is the old man elorp nt and like Nathan'el ataeon never said an idle or fuoi'.sh thing. Ho is as solid as a rock, .--olfpoiso:l and self-prepared on nil great questions. In I .SO 1 he volunteered as a private and soon rose to major and then to lieutenant colonel; next lie raised and equipped a regiment and oceanic Its colonel. In ISM he was nominated for brigadier general by Robert R Uee. but declined it. Hater on he was constrained to accept the honor and was with toe General Johnston to the close. Tn ISTd he was elect d to the United States Senate and rocl'vt. d in 1882. in 1888. in 1S94. and again in IftOO. making his tlftli successive teim. He well deserves a monument aft<T he dies and a place in the Hall of Fame, it Is a comfort to us all to lie assured that no man ranks him in the United States Senate, for he is a treasurehouse of knowledge, an I there is not a cloud over his candor, his truth or his integrity. When he speaks he has something to say and knows how to say it and when to unit. Tom Ronton said of Nathaniel Macon. "He rarely spoke but a few sentences, but utteri d more good sense In getting up out of his chair and sitting down again than was contained In the long and elaborate speeches of most Senators." General Morgan's long career reminds ire of Maeon. for he. too. was a private in the revolutionary war. He held public office for fifty seven years and John Randolph said of him. "He is the wisest. the purest and best man I ever knew." ' Twice he declined a place In the cabinets of two presidents, but af-) Inr U ~ >, .1 -? ! " ' "" * ' .< i un Him i miii-u iiim was i j. years iir.i hp accepted thp offirn of justice of the peace in his home district. Tie never recommended any of his kindred f ir appointment to office, lie refused pav for his service as a soldier and refused to receive a pension afterwards?and voted against all pensions or rewards or gratuities. He died as calmly as Socrates, but without the poison, and his grave is on a high, barren ridge marked with no marble, only a pile of stones, which was according to his will. Nathaniel Macon was my father's ideal of a great and good .nan. He placed him above all other statesmen, for he declared that he was as wise as Solomon and purer than David. ^ When J was in Warren county <romc years aco I was told that Macon's father lived In an old-fashioned double log house. For some years it had mud and stick chimneys above the flre-iams and was covered with boards of Ills own make. In course of time ho tore away the chimneys and rebuilt them of stone and brick, and tore, away the hoards and cov red with shingles. 1/iter on as li" cot able he weatherboarded the oats de with plank and ceiled the inside hv beginning at ihn top of the wall and letting the plank lap up Instead of down, so that his wife c cld pour hot water in the cracks .in ! kill the bedbugs. 1 reckon that Tom IP-nton. who wrote his biography, git his antl-pens'cn principles from Mncnn fop TP-it.on In n rriot ?nf> in the Senate opposed a prnsion to General Harrison's widow an?l railed it "a new dmarturc that would load to thi bofotnle^s rulf of pensions and pratuitlrs." We)| it Is a bottomless gulf both to tlio State an 1 nation. In this connection I ruminated on who were our preatest rv n in Gcorga who most, drservers a niche in 'he temple of fame. Tly rn-nmon consent. Oglethorpe seems entitle-! tr? the first place, but a iloren or more have advocates for the second plaee. I reckon however, that Crawford -Lone will ret It not as a statesman or soldier or inventor or nhilantroolvt. h"t rather as a thootrbtfel discoverer like Jonner, who d' covered ti'e hralinp art of v >rcm' hi The question is a very pern!e\inq one. for some a; e preat in 0"C phase of eharaeter and some in another. My wife thinks that liishop Pearco i * t whs tho grou.*e?t man, because he had the greatest c: lling and filled it as no other man lias done, and she quotes : that verse from Daniel which says, \ "They who have called many to I rlghteousntS3 shall shine as tho stars forever and forever." M.v wifo grew up under his matchless preaching, and is a pretty good Methodist yet. This remlndH me of a dollghtfol sketch I find in the nroceedines r?f Fhn n?t Georgia Flor Association held al Warm Springs In July. The subject Is "Thw Georgia Lawyer" viewed by a woman. The woman is Mrs. J. Render Terrell, of Greenville. The papers generally read at these annual meetings ar dry and prosy to everybody save the Jawyersr, but this paper Is charming, entertaining and instructive from beginning to end. The first sentence attracted me. and I Kepi on to tllo last, and my feeling at Its close was?well, that woman Is a trump, she is a historian, a philosopher and a first-rate lawyer, even though she be a woman. I road tt aloud to my female family. She closes with a poetic apostrophe to the Geor. In,,.,.... -1.1,.). .... P>i4v ia??; ti hiiiv 11 uj.iuij- uu uiliui kUUakV defendant will appreciate: "The parson points the way to heaven. And then with ten lor <-ure The doctor consummates the work And sonds the jiutiont there. "But the Georgia lawyer would tlelap Departure with such cries: Hold! Can this man read his title clear To mansions in the skies? "In doubt he files a brief and seeks To hold the ignoramus And stops his flight to heavenly bliss By injunction or mandamus." And so, while loolJiug around for * the greatest man. wo might well pause and hear what Mrs. Terrell says about John Forsyth. She says. "Forsyth was a champion for the establishment cf our supreme court, aiul earnestly advised it in his message in IMiS." lie said, "It is an awful reflection that life, liberty anjj reputation are dependent upon the decision of a single judge uncontrolled and uncontrollable in his circuit." Then she continues, "Forsyth's matchless oratory and the puiity of n'.s private cz.:\ political life won for him a name that will be honored and rc^ vered always. While in the United States senate lie bad no superior as an orator, and was called the equal of Lord Frskine" If 1 had a paper cf my own 1 would publish every line of Mrs. Terrell's delightful paper. And the next Sunday 1 would publish the paper read by J. 11. Merrill, of Thomasvllle. on "The Ilihle in the Lawyer's Library." Why. this paper ought to he read and studied not only by the lawyers, but liv every preacher In the land. It is is fit for a text-hcok in the colleges, and it is so interspersed with gems of good wit and mi hum mm one aocs not get urea. And there is nn admirable paper on the same line by II. Warner Hit). ^J called "Historic l.andmarKs *>f the / Law," and he, too. has dlllgoutly perused net onlv the Tlihle. but :be Apoehrypha. His story as to how Daniel made his reputation as a lawer will be new to most readers. I wish 1 had space to make mention of all the prood things in this little volume. For. ns there were giants in the nays that are gone, even so we have great men and great, women among us now Hero we have learned sketches i?y Bueh men as J. C. C. Black, Reuben Arnold.
