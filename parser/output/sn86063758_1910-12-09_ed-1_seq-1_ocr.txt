VoLUmE XLVL NUXBER 99. NEWBERRY, SOUTH CAROLThA, FRIDAY DECEMBER 9,1910. TWC A WK1 A a Newberry Le Prizes Most Prominent County A dent, Mr. A. D. I Number of I In another column in this issue oi The Herald and News will be seen thb bst of the prizes awarded at the Soutt Atlantic States Corn exposition, nov -i progress in Columbia, and it takef only a casual glance at the list to se tat Newberry easily carries off thi tonors. A great deall of the credit, and i' ket, the main credit for the success oi his exposition is due to Mr. A. D Rudson, of this county, who is presi dent of the association. It was large Ty through his untiring efforts that thf exposition was launched, and has beem successfully carried through. Mr. Hudson has a modal farm bimself, and ikis displays of corn *on ny of the rizes at the exposition. In the grand sweepstakes for North O%roalna, South Carolina and Georgia, Ve first prize for the best single ear Tariety, vthite corn, 10 ears, was 4-wazded Mr. A. D. Hudson, of New 4 erry. The Augusta Chronicle loving cup was awarded Mr. Hudson. This cup was for the best exhibition in western Aouth calima. In the grand hcampon sweepstakes .ontest, the silvier cup, given by T. W. Woods & Some, of Richmond, wa awrded to Mr. A. D. Hudson, and for the beat fifty ears Mr. A. D. Hudson was the wIiner. In the Third district the prize-win meis from Newberry were: Best ten *,^ . S * *- * * S * * * * * FARXERS' SAPLES. S * * Clemson Extension Work-Arti- * cle 27. ************ * It is section 1540 of the law (act 1909)' which provides "That any pur chaser of fertilizers may have the same analyzed by taking a sample within 15 days after <delivery, from at Teast ten per cent. of the lot, in the 1eresence of at least two disinterested witnesses, 'who shall have six days previous notice, and sealed in the presence of a third disinterested party, accompanied by a certificate that it was so drawn in accordance with this aet." The manufacturers of fertilizers, with many thousands of dollars in Tested in their costly plants and ex penslve machinery, are entitled under the law to protection and safe guard of their rights, but we have thought 'that section 1540 might be further simplified without impairing its effi eiency or protection to both parties. Hfowever, it is not tha co(llege but the alegislature which makes these laws, atid we are bound to obey or be held reBponsible for the analysis of illegal gamnples which we had no right to make. In our directions to farmers for sending these samples, we do not ask~ them to tell us who made the ferti lizer or how much of each is guaran teed, but only to tell us whether it contains phosphoric acid, ammonia or potash, or all three of them. I am sometimes asked if these farmers analyses could not be made without kinowing the names of the ingrediants! I reply, yes, but the rearan we ask~ 'dese names is t6 economize time and expense in their analysis; in this way, if the chemists are told to look for phosphoric acid, they make a solution and analyze for this only; if told it contains potash and phos acid, ther they are told to examine for these twro, or if told it contains ammonia phosphoric acid and potash, then they are told to examine for all three. 11 we were told nothing, every sample containing odily one ingredient wouk hiave to be examnined for all three, and thus consume4 time and expense with oat any additional security or advan -age to the farmer. This department 'with its inspectiori miethods and analysis, will ever stand for the protection of farmers by in* sisting m'at they shall get what thei -.t- tb aen timne for honier 2ds in Corn At Exposition ot Only in Having the Presi= fudson, But in the 3rizes Taken. ers yellow corn, A. M. Miller, New- ( berry; H. B. Hendrix, Newberry; J. C. Stephens, Newberry. Best single ear, A. D. Hudson, Newberry. Best ten ears white corn, A. D. Hudson, New- 1 berry. Best ten ears white corn, A. D. Hudson, Newberiry; J. A. Sligh, Sliighs. For Newberry county the prizes were as fol'lows: lst prize, $10-S M. Duncan. 2d prize, $5.00-J. A. Sligh, Slighs. 3d prize, $3.00-J. H. Eargle, Po 4th prize, $2.00-I. X. Smith, Kin ards. That Newberry is the banner county < in this corn expositon, both in havingj2 the president and in the number of prizes taken, is peculiarly gratifying, I and shows the stand which the people of Newberry county are taking for di versiffed farming, and for a. greater z county, a greater State and a greater c South. While the world's record for corn production to the acre is held by South Carolina, this honor has not yet come to Newberry county, but the1f great stimulus which this exposition bs given the growing of corn in this county, taken in consideration with the energy of Newberry people, makes it not impossilyle that in the not far futur Newberry county will have a record second to none. At least, a that is the ideal which has been se. t manufacturers by protecting them I from competition with others less serupulous. Those samples found de- 3 ficient below tha very reasonable mar gin allowed by law, are published in s our bulletin in capital letters, and with black index hand pointing to i the name of the company, thus giving c notice to buyers of the rebate in pric2 T to which such deficiency entitles them. In response to an inquiry to manu- is facturers and farmers whether or not such rebates were being demanded,t two of the former testified that they , had paid them in pretty large sums; e and we presume that 'buyers generally , avail themselves of these rebates. c Any one wishing further proof that every statement herein made is cor- t rect, is respectfully invited to visit our office and the laboratory here, wvhere e records and evidence will be submit ted in proof of each. c H. M. Stackhouse, Secretary Board.

But a few years ago, so short a time. n fact, that young men and women of c 5 and 30 years can not help but re nember them, the dime museums of g a ;e country were heavily patronized. h ~Iost of the amusement seekers of to- t lay can remember when their home c ;own held such a "palace" of enter- C ainment where they could inspect the nost alarming looking examples of mman life, look over a bewildaring :ollection of wax works, and 1sten tot vaudeville show all for the sum of .0 cents. Who among us of mature rears has forgotten the wonderful glass' blower always to be found in0 bose days in a corner of the museum. >r the marvalous product of his skill1 whch sold as "souvenirs?"I With the increasing popularity of he moving-picture houses. these nuseums have, year by year, become c ss in favor. The armless wonder o longer attracts. The daring sword a wallower can not even interest the t >oys, and the jovial fat lady with her t ackage of photographs has become a lecided back number. Outside of the circus tents few hu- r nan curiosities are now exhibited. a ['here has been a great slump in the v reak business. -b The popularity of nature freaks as b mublic entertainers was at its height thout 15 years ago. L Then the living pin cushion, the hu- ti nan frog and others of like ilk trav- g led over a circuit of museums two or f nore times during -a season. TPhey tl ommmanded salaries that would com- Ii >are favorably with the remuneration si riven now to some of our foremost e h'eatrical stars. Now the human frog V s glad to hop about a fifty-foot tent d or $15 a week, and the living pin ushion has to stand lots of "painful" a ests for not more than $20. t Twenty years ago the famous Bow- u ry, in New York, was lined with dime g nuseum. Now there is not one of si .here houses in Greater New York. In 01 st. Louis, Chicago, Philadelphia, B3os- Ci on and other large cities conditions 1e tre apidly assuming the same aspect. That the moving-picture show has si un2~sed the downfall of the fre::- is a1 'ceded by theatrical men gene-ally. b I''he ever-ening variety of entertainl- a rnterest Grow.

It was at ibe Gaiety Museun in eew York. which long since has b ' losed, that ',..aatFur night" T- ori iated. Sixteen years ago roughness d horse-play and cries- of "Get the ok!" were not associated with ama ur nights. The amateurs who went 2 were the genuine articdle. Stage bruck girls from the factories, sing g and whistling newsboys and young lumbers or clerks in Bowery stores !ho fully believed they were destined be Herimanns or Kelars went on the did amateur nights at the Gaiety. Amateur nights at the Gaiety was ly once a week, but the froaks were hand all the tine. There wore me more popular than others who d drawing power and foillowing all eir own. There were the Murray iplets, for instance, three good-look ig young men,' dwarfed, . who dare .refully chaperoned by their mother. The fond and watchful mother kept child's toy bank on the platform at e feet of the best-looking of the iplets. When any particularly bold forward young girl pressed for !ard too dlosely, watchful Mrs. Mur .y would say: "If you think so much Tommy, put a dime in his bank." It ras surpr.isng how many dimes would forthcoming in the course ofa usy day and evening. One of the prime favorites in St. ouis museums was Emma Schaler, ie ossified girl. She was a bright r and pretty so far as eyes and satures were concerned. She entered e ranks of human curiosities as "the ving skeleton debutante," and as such Larred over the dime museum circuit ast and west and north and south rith James Coffee, "the skeleton Eli Rowen, the armless wonder, was man of handsome face and stalwart )rso. He was well educated and was 2doubtedSiy one of the most intelli nt of freaks. He did acrobatic unts, wrote visiting cards and was hberwise a capable entertainer. Oc sionally he edified the museum aud ncs with song and story. Before the days of Jack Johnson'sI iccess as wit and repartee as well ; fistic endeavor, George, the turtle y, was most famno"s among his race a wit.

This last particularly was an exagger ation. George always had a cheerful word for everybody and in his hours of ease delighted in shooting craps or playing pool. As skillful as George, the turtle boy, was with the cue, La Loo, the Hindu marvel, was equally expert ca the green table. La Loo was the freak with two bodies and one head. Before the museum opened and after it closed, when playing the same lates, the turtle boy and the Hindu marvel could be found in the nearest poolroom playing pool. Those who played with the turtle boy had to con ent to what he called "his ground rules." These were that he was to be permitted to walk around the edge >f the table, a feat of equlilibrium hat was wonderful to see.
