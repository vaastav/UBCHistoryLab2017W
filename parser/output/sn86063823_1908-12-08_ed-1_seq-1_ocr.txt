1 - JRdPSWEJUL ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO, TUESDAY1 EVENING, DECEMBER 8, 1908 VOLUME 6. NUMBER 241 WML1 r .A ROOSEVELT CALLS FOR EARLY STATEHOOD I advocate the immediate ad mission of New Mexico and Arizona as States. This should . be done "at the present session of the Congress. The people of the two Territories have made it evident by their votes that they will not come in as one State. The only alternative is to admit them as two, and I trust that this will be done without delay. The President's Message. To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: The financial standing of the Na tion at the present time is excellent, and the financial management of the Nation's Interests by the Govern ment during the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory result. But our currency system is Imperfect and it rs earnestly to be hoped that the Currency Commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, there was an increase In the amount of money in circulation of $902,991,399. The in crease in the per capita during this period ' was $7.06. Within this time there were several occasions when it was necessary for the Treasury De partment to come to the relief of the money market by purchases or red- -emptlons of United States bonds; by increasing deposits in national banks; by stimulating additional issues of national bank notes, arid by facilitat ing importations from abroad of gold. Our imperfect currency system ha3 made these proceedings necessary, and they were effective until the mon etary disturbance in the fall of 1907 immensely increased the difficulty of ordinary methods of relief. By the middle of November the available working balance in theVrreasury had Ibeen reduced to approximately $5,000 000. Clearing house associations throughout the country had been ob Hged to resort to the expedient of is suing clearing house certificates, to be used as money. In this emergency it was determined to invite subscrip tions for $50,000,000 Panama Canal bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent certificates of indebtedness au thorized by the act of June 13, 1898. It was proposed to re-deposit in the national banks 'the proceeds of these issues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional circulating note of national "banks. The moral effect of this procedure was sojjreat that It was necessary to Issue only $24,631 980 of the Panama Canal bonds and $15,436,500 of the certificates of in debtedness. During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, the balance between the net ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses of the Gov ernment showed a surplus in the four years 1902, 1903, 1906 and 1907, and a deficit in the years 1904, N1905, 1908 and a fractional part of the fiscal year 1909. The net result was a sur plus of $99,283,413.54. The financial op erations of the Government during this period, based upon these differ ences between receipts and expendi tures, resulted in a net reduction of the interest bearing debt of the UnlV i ed States from $987,141,040 to $897, 253,990. notwithstanding thaf-there bad ibeen two sales of Panama Canal bonds amounting in the aggregate to $54, 631,980. and an issue of three per cent certificates of Indebtedness und- 'er the act of June 13, 189S. amounting to $15,436,500. Refunding operations of ti3 Treasury Departincat under lie act of March 14. 1900, resulted in the conversion into two per cent eon - sols Dt 1930 of $200,309,400 bonds , bearing higher rates of interest. A de crease of $8,687,956 in the annual In terest charge resulted from these op- . erations. Corporations. As regards the great corporations engaged in interstate business, and especially the railroads, I can only re peat what I have already again and again said In tny messages to the Con gress. I believe that nder the inter state clause of the Constitution the United States has complete and para- mount right to control all agencies of interstate commerce, and I believe tha1 the Nahonal Government alone can I exercise this Tight with wisdom, and effectiveness so as both to secure jus- tice from, and to do justice to, great corporations which are the most im portant factors In modern business, 1 'believe that it is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all combina- tions as is done by the Sherman an ti-trust law, because such a law can be enforced only imperfectly and un equally, and Its "enforcement works almost as much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that instead of an unwise effort to prohibit all combina tions, there shall be substituted a law which shall expressly permit combina tions which are in the interest of the public, but shall at the same time give to some agency of the National Government full power of control and supervision over them. One of the chief features of this control should be securing entire publicity in all mat ters which the'public has a right to know, and furthermore, the power, not by Judicial but by executive action, to prevent or put a stop tp every form of improper favoritism or other wrong doing. The railways of the 'country should be put completely under the Inter state Commerce Commission and re moved from the domain of the anti trust law. The power of the Com miss- ton should be made thoroughgoing, so fhat it could "exercise complete super vision and control over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. .As regards rates, at least, this power should be summary. The power to investigate the financial operations and accounts of the railways has been one of the most valuable features in recent leg islation. Power to make combinations and -traffic agreements should be ex plicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of the commission 'be ing .first gained and the combination or agreement being published in all its details. In the interest of the pub lic the representatives of the public Should have complete power to see that the railroads do their duty by the public, and as a matter of course FEis power should also be exercised so as. to see that no injustice is done to the railroads. The share-holders, the employes and " the shippers all have Interests that must -be guarded. It is to the interest of all of them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed, and that there should 'be no improper issuance of securities. The guiding intelligences necessary for the successful building and suc cessful management of railroads should receive ample remuneration; but no man should be allowed to make money in connection with railroads out of fraudulent over-capitalization and kindred stock-gambling perform ances; there must be no defrauding of investors, oppression of the -farmers and business men who ship freight or callous disregard of the rights and needs of the employees. In addition to this the interests of the sharehold ers, of the employees, and of the ship pers should all be guarded as against one. another. To give any one of them undue - and improper consideration is to do' injustice to the others. Rates must be as low as is compatible with giving proper returns to all the em ployees of the railroad, from the high est to the lowest, and proper returns to the shareholders; but they must not, for instance, be reduced in such a fashion as to necessitate a cut in the wages of the employees or the ab olition of the proper and . legitimate profits -of honest shareholders. Telegraph and telephone companies engaged in Interstate business should be put under the jurisdiction of - the Interstate Commerce Commission.. (Here the message goes on to issue a warning against Improper and -dem agogic attacks on law-abiding and hon est corporations and men of - great wealth.) The danger to American democracy lies not in the least In the concentra tion of ' administrative power in re sponsible : and accountable hands! It lies In having the power insufficiently concentrated," so that( no one can be held responsible to the people for Its use. Concentrated power Is palpable, visible, responsible, easily- reached. quick hr held to account. Power scat tered through many "administrators, many legislators, many men who. work behind and through legislators and administrators, is Impalpable, is un seen, is Irresponsible, can not be reach ed, can not be held to account. Dem ocracy is in peril wherever the admin istratipn of political power is scatter ed among a variety of men who work In secret, whose very names, are un known to the common people. It is not in peril from any man who derives authority from the people, who exer cises it in sight of the people, and who is from time to time compelled to give an account of its exercise to the peo ple. Labor. (The President draws the attention of the Congress to the status of . the wage worker, whether by his hands or his brain, and makes an earnest plea for such a condition of affairs that the worker, If a mechanic shall own his tools,, if a farmer, his land, and for a frank division of the advantages con ferred iby labor. Also a plea is made for the establishment of postal sav-H ings banks.) ' , v Corporate finances must be supervis ed so as to make it far. safer than at present for the man of small means to Invest his money in stocks. There must be prohibition of chiM labor, di minution of woman abor, shortening of hours of all mechanical labor; stock watering should be . prohibited and stock gambling so far as possiblendis couraged. There should be a progress ive enheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial education should be encour aged. As far as possible we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium upon thrift, hard work, and business energy; but these qualities cease to be the main factors in accumulating a fortune long (before that fortune reaches a point whore it would be ser iously affected by any inheritance tax such as I propose. It is eminently .right that the Nation should fix the terms upon which the great fortunes are inherited. They rarely do good and they often do harm to those who inherit them in their entirety. Protection for Wageworkers. But there is one matter with which the Congress should deal at this sesJ sion. There should no longer be any1 paltering with the question of taking care 'of the wageworkers, who, under our present industrial system, be-' come killed, crippled, or worn out as part of the regular incidents of a giv en business. The majority of wage earners must have their, rights secur ed for them by State action ; but the National Government should legis late in thoroughgoing and far-reach-, lng fashion not only for all employees of the National Government, but for all -persons engaged in interstate com-, merce. The object sought for could be achieved to a measurable degree. as far as those killed or crippled are concerned by proper employers lia bility laws. I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight hour day should as rapidly and as far as practicable be extended to " the entire work being carried on by the Govern ment; the present law should be a mended to embrace contracts on those public works which the present word ing of the act seems to-exclude. ' " The Courts. I taost earnestly urge upon the Con gress the duty of increasing the tot ally inadequate salaries now given to our Judges. On the whole there is no body of public servants who do as. val uable work, nor whose moneyed re ward is so inadequate compared to their work. Beginning with the Su preme Court the Judges should have their salaries doubled. It Is earnestly to be - desired that some method should be devised for doing away with the long delays which now obtain in the administration of justice, and which operate with pecul iar severity against persons of small means, and favor only the very crim inals whom it is most desirable to punish. These long delays in the fin al decisions of cases make in the ag gregate a crying evil; and a remedy should he devised. . At the last election certain leaders of organized labor made a violent and sweeping attack upon the entire judic iary of the country, an attack couch ed In such terms as to include , the most upright, honest and .broad-mind ed judges, no less than those of nar rower mind and mare restricted out look. It was the kind of attack ad mi abry fitted to prevent any successful attempt to reform abuses of the judic iary, because it gave the - champions (Continued on page Two.) . MAY 

HAVE 3D VICTIM CONSEQUENCES OF SUNDAY TRAIN WRECK GROWING IN THEIR SERIOUSNESS. NELSON IS PARALYZED Report Came Today of the Serious Condition of the Conductor on the Plain view Train Alberts and Gos sett Go to Attend the Investigation Both of Them Are More, or Less Injured. News came from Amarillo this mor ning of the serious condition of Bar ney; Nelson, conductor of the Plain view branch train, that was in the wreck Sunday morning near Canyon City: the message being in effect that he might yet die as a result of this ac cident, which would make the third victim of the catastrophe. According to the message, Mr. Nelson is now paraiyzed and in a very serious condi tion. It is known among the railroad men that he was not in good shape for work anyhow, and this lessens his chances of recovery. The latest report from Claud C. Hoi- stein, fireman on the No. 201 train, is that he is doing nicely at the hospital In Amarillo. Conductor Wm.

SWEDISH VICE-CONSUL COMMITS SUICIDE. St. Louis, Dec 7. Charles A. Ek stromer, Swedish vice-consul at St. Louts, committed suicide by drinking prussic acid today. Some time ago President Roosevelt requested his ex chequer on account of a controversy in which he became involved with fedH era! officials. Later he was restored to his position. It is believed some difficulty with his superiors In the con snjarservice Is the cause of his sui cide. " " Ekstromer went to Washington on uettair or friends to whom the sec ond class mail privileges in promoting a United States Peoples' Bank had been denied. The President would not see him and he was advised to put in writing what he might have to say. Ekstromer wrote that in Sweden even a peasant might see the King and he considered the President's action in refusing td see him, "un-American and unjust." This brought from the White House the statement that the letter was "impertinent, uncalled for and dis courteous" and resulted in the with drawal of Ekstromer's exequator un til! he, apologized to the President. o OIL
