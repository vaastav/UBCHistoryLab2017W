Bloomfield, in discuss ing the Amboy bridge said that the reason the county did not get lower figures lor the construction of the bridge was because it exacted in its bond that the steel spans must he kept in repair for two years. That provision, he thought, made the bridge cost almost double. He said that he had gone among bridge builders to get figures for the 1 construction of the bridge and that [the American Bridge Company had ' told him that they could take the work for $40,000 without the repair specification, but that they wouldn't [ touch it with that stipulation. They held that they were not In the bridge tending, but the bridge building busi ness. Mr. Bloomfield holds that the coun ty would have done much better if it had taken its own risk on the bridge without, compelling the bidders to | take it. Under the bond, if the bridge -is damaged in any way by ice during the two years following the erection, then the contractors are responsible for ihe repair.?New Brunswick Home News.

MEASURES OF IMPORTANCE, Many Matters at Wide Interest Slated for Session of .Con gress Which Begins Today. j Washington, dec. 3.- keith houses of congress convened here today, but no business was transacted on the opening day other than routine. The proceedings in both houses in opening the Fifty-ninth session of con gress were of the most formal charac ter. The attention of the house was officially directed to the fact that four prominent members of that body Messrs. Hitt, Hoar. Ketehain and Ad ams?have died since the close of the j last session, and a motion for an ad Journnient out of respect to them im j mediately followed. The president's message will lie re- [ ceived tomorrow, and both houses will probably adjourn for the day as soon us it is read. It is expected that the nomination of Attorney General Moody to succeed Justice Brown on the su preme court bench will be among the first nominations to be sent in by the president. The senate has on Its calendar two important house bills, the immigration bill and the Philippine tariff bill, but there are snags in the pathway of both. Not a few members of both houses are anxious to meet the demands of Hie bankers and others for a more elastic currency, and it is quite eer taiu that there will be efforts to supply this want. The recommendations of tlie president in the interest of a tm tioual inheritance tax is awaited with i eager interest by many, i Among the questions slate I f ir a J liberal share of discussion, the tariff 'stands at the head of the list. The president himself, it is said, desires some changes. The Japanese question. ' the discharge of the negro soldiers, i the desirability of an iqeoine tax law. j the result of the late elections and the I trusts are also slated for discussion. Charles B.

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 3.?Laudeo ns a diplomat who tempered statecraft with the (tohlen Rule, tlie late John Hay was honored by the Jewish peo ple of tliis city when a handsome me morial window to the dead secretary of state was nnvelled at Keneseth Israel temple. Attended by Secretary of State Elilm Root, Oscar Straus, recently named by 1'resident Roosevelt as secretary of commerce and labor, and Andrew I). White, ex-mlillster to Russia and Oer many, together with six members of the Hay family, the exercises were among the most striking ever held in a Jewish synagogue. Among the members of the family present were Mrs. Payne Whitney and Mrs. James Wadsworth of New York, daughters of the late secretary, and Clarence Hay. a sbn. Mr. Root, who made the chief ad dress. said: "During John Hay's later years, among the familiar White House scenes of his youth, some incident would evoke a memory of his earlier days, and lie would give it to his friends, clad In the felicitous and charming expressions of which he was a master. "I remember that otice as we stood by the door of the old cabinet room he spoke of the dark and dreadful time when Lincoln was bearing the burden and the sorrow of the civil war and feeling his way among Innumerable ob stacles to his great conclusion of the emancipation of the slave. He told how the great president often in the dead of night gained relief from sleep lessness and restlessness by rising and seeking the chamber of Ills young as sistant private secretary, Mr. Hay, and. sitting on the" edge of the boy's bed, reading to him aloud some fa vorite book. As the story was told by Mr. Hay we could see the tail. gaunt form in white walking down the cor ridor in which he stood and the rug ged, careworn face seeking sympathy in the thoughts which might lift uf his soul above the turmoil of the days of doubts and distress. "Doubtless the cold words 011 the printed page lack power to beat back the invading throng of troubling thoughts, and life was given them by the finely sensitive appreciation ir? the noble anil ingenious youth. "The Instinct of Lincoln's genius di vined a kindred spirit in his young sec retary, and there in the silent watches of the night and in dally companion ship was molded and Inspired the char acter of our friend. "He has lived a noble life, he has fought the good light as Lincoln would have wished, and through the long se ries of the passing years the spirit of the great emancipator, the strongest, the just, the compassionate, has wrought mightily in the work of his great disciple for justice and tnerey, for freedom and peace, for the op pressed and forsaken of the earth. So in this temple of our (lod, 'who hath made all men in his image,' we unveil a? memorial set up in honor of one who j also gave his life for his country and humanity." ~~
