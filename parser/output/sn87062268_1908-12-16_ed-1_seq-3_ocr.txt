be produced in behalf of anyof them They consist simply of a string of In famous libels In form they are in part libels upon Individteals upon Mr Taft and ilr Robinson for instance But in fact they are in form and wholly a libel upon the United States govccnment I do not believe we stooiold concern ourselves with the par ticulair individuals Wiho wrote the ly ing and libelous editorials articles from correspondents or articles in the news columns The real offender Is Mr Joseph Pulitzer editor and pro prietor of the World IWhile the 1 criminal offense of which Mr Pulitzer has been guilty Is in form a libel upon individuals the great Injury done is blackening the good name of the American people It should not be tlefl to a private citizen to sue Mr Pulitzer for libel He should be prosecuted libel by the govern mental authorities In point of en couragement of iniquity in point of infamy of wrongdoing there Is noth ing to choose between a public serv ant who betrays his trust a pubHc servant who is guilty blackmail or theft or financial dishonesty of any kind and a man guilty as Mr Jo seph Pulitzer bas been guilty In this instance It therefore a high na tional duty to torjng to justice this villifier of the American people this roan who wantonly and wickedly and without one shadow of justification seeks to blacken the character of re putable private citizens and to con vict the government of his own coun tryin the eyes of the civilized world of wrongdoing of the basest and foul est kind wlea hfe has net one shadow of justification of any sort or descrip tion for the charge he has made The attorney general has under consider ation the form in which the proceed ings against Mr Pulitzer shall ibe brought The presIrient refers to various papers which he transmits with his message and calls attention to numer ous utterances and acts relating to the canal and Its purchase He cites the act of congress by which he was authorized to pay 40000000 for the canal property and says It was no < concern of the president what the new Panama canal company did with the money How It Was Done ErpaJning the method of conclud ing the purchase the president ys Thc Panama canal transaction was actually carried throusjh not by either the then secretary of state Jlr John Hay or the then secretary of war Mr Elihu Root both of whom however were cognizantof all the es sential features but by tile then at toraV general Mr PC Knox at pre e senator from Pennsylvania 1 Directed or approved every action and HB reopoasible SOT all that TOS done is oonyinc out the wiR of the oen Keveo anti the proviskms of the lam Mcted by coagreas after exhaustive exsnsBnation and discirsskra were Kcriifrulously complied with by tfce 1 1 t i I I S execitiv While the trxueaction was pending I saw Mr Cromwell but two or thre times aa fmy commnnica1 uons with him wes e limSted to the ex change of purely formal court siei Secretry Hay oocasiccslly saw Mm In the same manser I doubt W11 er r Root h ld any conversation with him The attorney general saw him frequently ie was o > aasei for the Paamma ooarBpany their coasnunica Uons were official ias representinf the two sides The action of the government he says was wholly uninfluenced by any question of who were or were not stockholders either in the new or the old company Ill as a matter of fact he ex plains the canal company either or both had been owned toy American citizens or by citizens of any other nationality It nwotrid not h ave altered in the slightest degree the action I taken by this gorernmeat Our con I cern was to get the canal property 1 I WhIch Traa owned by the French com pany and to see that the title was i plear Our transactions were carried on openly and were published in de I tail and we dealt solely so farvU the 1 interests of tie old Panama company were concerned with the liquidator appointed by the proper French governmental nmental body the civil tribunal of the Seine and In accordance with the decree of this same tribunal with the new Panama ti l company which also went into liquidation upon the sale to the United States All our transactions were carried on openly aDd were published in detail Paid Through Morgan The president states that the money was paid through the New York bank ing house of J P Morgan Com pany acting as fiscal agents of this sovermrtent into the Bank of France in Paris In these payments he says we followed the letter the decree of the governmental tribunal of France which had the authority to make such a decree the civil tribunal the Seine We had neither desire nor authority to go behind this decree of this proper governmental body as aU I the conflTcthig rights of the security holders of both companies had been j settled by the decree of said court by i ratification of the arbitration which I resulted in that division I Wish to make as clear as possible and as emphatic as possible the state I ment that we did not JtSLve anything i I to do ivlth the distribution of a dollar i of the 40000000 we paid as regards j stockholder bondholder of the i French companies save that We fol j lowed out the award of the arbitra tors appointed in accordance with the decree of the French court which had i dealt with the subject an awarding a i certain proportion to the old company and a certain proportion to the new company Any question concerning the stockholders bondholders or other beneficiaries of the proceeds of ale w purely a question for the civil tribunal of the Seine the French governmental body with which this nation lad nothing vvtoatever to do About Cromwell Under these circumstances there was Hot the Ifghtest need for Mr Cromwell to give any Information the subject of the companies for Which ie had counsel This yernmet4iesiioXacerii with ilr Oromwel reJstion to these compa niles or etherof them or with the amount of Tistj > r9Ses pal compensa tion 1t was not the affair of this gov ernment to Inquire who were the se curity holders of fee companies evertheless Mr Cromwell of his owai accord Qias submitted to one to gether with a copy of his statement i published on the Hth Instant and which T transmit herewith a full list of the stockholders of the new Pana I ma canal company of France on Janu ary 15 1900 numbering over 6000 and a list of all stockholders who were present at a special meeting of the company held February 28 1902 immediately after the cable offer of the company was nwcde to the United States January 911 1902 to accept the appraisement ot 40000000 made by the Isthmian canal commission and to sell for said sum the Panama canal concessions and other property and the shares of the Panama railroad company Referring to accompanying docu ments the president says no payment will be made upon the stock of the old Panama canal company and he is informed the payment on the bonded indebtedness wtfl be but ten per cent About 6000 shareholders of the new Panania company will receive pay ments and they will recover their orig inal Investments with annual Interest of about three per cent The accounts and records of this liquidation which concluded in June 1asthe says are on deposit with the Credit Lyonnai of Paris as a proper custodian of the same ap pointed upon such liquidation Recent ly a request was made by a private individual to inspect the records ot these payments but answer was made by the custcdians that they saw no proper reason for granting such re quest by a stranger and inasmuch as there Is not the slightest ground for suspicion of any bad faith in the transaction it hardly seems worth while to make the request but If the congress desires I have BO doubt that on the request of our ambassa dor in Paris the lists of Individuals will be shown him As a mutter of fact there is noth ing whatever in which this govern ment is interested to investigate about this transaction So far as this government concerned every step of the slightest importance has been made public by its executive and every step taken in France has thjre been made public by the proper offi cials A
