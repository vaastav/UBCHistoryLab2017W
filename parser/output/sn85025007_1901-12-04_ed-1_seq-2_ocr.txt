? %lt\* WEDNESDAY EVENING. DBO. 4 lttOl zmr. ? ? ? j. .-. .? - The eep?blioanb in the ??a?? lost no time in tbeir premeditated attempt ta minimize tbe strength of tbe South in Congreee, for on Monda? tbe opening day, Mr. Moody, of Massachusetts, in? troduced tbe following joint resolution. "Tbat a select committee of three members, to be appointed by tbe Speaker, to inveetlgate aod report whether, at tbe congressional election io Louisiana, tbe right? of anj of toe male inhabitants of that State were ?bridged or denied; wbetber, if tbe right of any person to vote was denied or abridged, tbe members from Louisi? ana so chosen are entitled to tbeir seat?; ?od wbetber Congreee ebould enact further legislation to carry out the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments to tbe United States Constitution." Republican Senators considered tbe rearrangement of oommittees and in view of the increase of their majority in tbe Senate they decided to reduce democratic representation on the vari* one committees and correspondingly add to the republican representatioo. There is understood to be a combined effort on tbe part of tbe republicans to reduce tbe representation in the Houee of tbe southern Statee whioh have re? stricted tbe negro vote. Louielaea is selected because the pr?sent delegation is the first ooe to be elected under ooe of tbe new constituions of tbe southern Statee whose suffrage clauses disfran? chise negroes. With the Reed rules in the House and tbe decided republican majority in the Senate, dotare will surely be attempted in tbe latter body, and then will the republicans ran j things to suit themselves. ?I1 ,?!,.,. - The following paragraph from the President's message will be considered by the Filipinos as the acme of cold irooy : "History may safely be challenged to show a single instanoe in which a mas? terful race auch as ours, having been forced by the exigencies of war to take possession of an ?lieo land, bas behaved to its inhabitants with tbe disinterested zeal for their progress that our people have shown in tbe Philippines. To leave tbe island At this time would mean that they would fall into a welter nf murderous aoaroby. Suob desertion of duty oo our part would be a crime against humanity. ? * * There need not be the slightest fear ot our oot con? tinuing to give them all the liberty for which they are fit." Io this oooneotiou it may be added tbat while tbe President's message was belog read in Coogrees the following dispatch was received in Washington from Manila: "General Smith, of the American troops in Samar, bas peremptorily re? fused Ibe request of General Lukban, commander of the rebels in tbe isiaod, to open negotiations for surreoder. Smith eeot word that the time for ne? gotiations was passed." NotwithstaHDIHG Secretary Root made the declaration that offloial inter? ference lo the comlog elections in Cuba would not be tolerated, Eusebio Her? nandez, president of f? democratic party in that island, has sent to Secre? tary Root another message sayiog, "Under the present arrangements in? terference ie inevitable, as all members of the central oauvaesing board are candidates for offloe and are also mem? bers of tbe executive committee of Seoor Thomas Estrada Palma. Both high aud low officiale are openly working In tbe interests of Senator Palm?, who is said to have the support of tbe Uoited States government." A delegation representing Geo. Maso will shortly leave Havana for Washington to submit these facts to tbe administra? tion and to suggest certain changes to insure fair elections, but this govern? meet does oot want Maso to be elected ?nd tbe Cabane will have only their trouble for tbeir pains. President Roosevelt in bia mes? sage says: "We do oot wish to see any old world military power grow up on this continent, or to be compelled to become a military power ourselves. Those who do not believe tbat tbis has already beoome a mighty power sbonld ?imply read the statement of tbe ex peosee of maintaining tbe army and navy. ^____^_^__ In the Houee Mr. Kitchin of North Carolina has introduced a bill for a constitutional amendment repealing the Fifteenth amendment. The repeal of this amendment would simplify things wonderfully, Most reasonable people think that the civil war pension list is already suf fiently large.but a republioan member of Congress on Monday introduced a bill to pension every man that ever entered the union army during the time of that w?r. ^____ Amono the billa introduced in tbe Heute oa Mondty wat one by Mr. Bolter, of New York, protesting against the conduct of the war la Sonta Africa.

Washington. December 4. Mr. Oley of Virginia has introduced in tbe Houte bille providing for tbe ereotion of a public building at Radford, Va., to revive the riebt of action under tbe captured and abandoned property ?ote; to restore in pert proceeds from tbe sale of capture! and abandoned property aod for tbe relief of parlies for property taken from tbem by mil ? tary forcee of tbe United State?.

Churoh, of Alexandria. Congressman Babcock, of Wisconsin, derisively referred to by some of bis republican colleagues aa tbe "trust smaaber," is still determiued to earn tbe title. He bas not yet introduced bis measure looking to tbe removal of tar? iti duties from trust manufactured goods, in?, will do so as soon as be con a dere the moment opportune, "I am determiued to make tbe fight," be said today, "and 1 expect to find a good deal of support on tbe republican aide. A? far as I am concerned I would be just ae well pleased if I didn't get back oo tbe ways and means committee, for then I would be entirely free and un? hampered in the flgbt. But if I am not put back, it will not be on personal gounds. It will be because I am rep? resenting a certain prinoiple. And to tight a principle in tbat way would fur? nish a very dangerous precedent." ?? ? action of President Hutto, of tbe Panama Company in going over tbe heads of tbe Isthmian Canal Commie siooers wbo were especially appointed to deal witb tbe matter and presenting to tbe President a propositi in for tbe sale of tbe Panam? pro; y to tbe Unltld States has caused ? ueiderable comment at tbe Capitol. Several Sen? ators characterize it as a most ill-ad? vised move. Members of Congress wbo last session looked witb some favor on tbe Panama proposition said today tbat tbey are cow opposed to it because of the open acticity of tbe Frenob Gov? ernment through its embassy bere in trying to force a deal witb this coun? try. Senator Morgan and Representa tive Hepburn both said today tbat tbe now admitted Interest and activity of tbe f rencb embassy proved the cor? rectness of tbeir assenions tbat the? French Government whs interested in tbe Panama Canal and must be reck? oned witb. Senator Marlin called on tbe Presi? dent yesterday to introduce Judge Griffin, a republican friend, wbo wants to be postmaster at an office in Roan okecounty, Va., "Mr. President said Senator Martin, I merely called to in? troduce my old friend, wbo wants to talk with you. I do not ask for any? thing for bim, In f-tct, I do not think it is in good taste for democrats to try to advise a republican administration about appointments or anything else." Senator Martin did not rem ?in to listen to tbe tiilk Judge Griffin bad witb tbe President. Tbe man who jilts bis fiancee without excellent reasons therefore may not re? ceive a commission in tbe army of tbe United States witb tbe consent of Sec retsry Root. Tbe Secretary made tbe rule for bis own guidance yesterday by deoiding that he could not recommend Captain W.P. Crawford, of Ches er, S. C? for appointment to a Iieutoeaccy in tha regular service beoaused he ie faaed to marry Miss Rebecca Douglas!?, oftbesame place, giving reasons which the Secretary decided did not justify tbe refusal. A bill was introduced in the House yesterday by Representative Padgett. of Tennessee, to reimburse ex-Coo fed - eratee for horses and side-arms taken from tbem by Federal troop? in viola? tion of the terms of surrender. This bill was passed by both houses at tbe last Congress, but for some reason President McKinley failed to sign it, and it never became a law. The new Hay-Paunoefote treaty re? garding the Isthmian canal was sent to the Senate today and was referred for consideration to the oommlttee on Foreign Relations. The terme of the treaty baye been heretofore made pub? lic. It abrogates tbe old Clayton-Bui wer treaty, gives the United Stales tbe rlgbt to absolutely own and control any canal tbat it may construct to unite the Atlantic and Pacific oceans; leaves to tbe Uolted States the task of guarantee? ing its neutrality without reference to other nation; and permite the United States to fortify the canal if it deems such a course necessary.

The General Assembly of Virgloia met in Richmond today in biennial session. Tbe democratic members of the Senate and House met in separate caucuses last night and nominated tbe following officers: In tbe Senate: Henry T. Wickbam, president pro tern.; Jo? seph Button, clerk: Frank B. Watkins. sergeant-at-arms, and S. M. Donald, doorkeeper. In the House: Jobo F. Ryan, of Loadono, speaker; John W. William-?, of Giles, clerk; J. 11. Johnson, sergeant at-srms, and A. 0. Sullivan, of Mont? gomery, doorkeeper, aod P. E. Lips comb, second doorkeeper. Mr. Lipe comb was opposed by George Hudson, of Rockbridge, but won with ease. Judge William H. Mann was chosen ckairmsn of the Senate caucus and Delegate W. H. Booz chairman of tbe House caucus. Clerk Button, of tbe Senate, an? nounced tbe following appointments last night: T. A. Lynch, of Tazswell, first assistant; H. C. Mann, of Peters? burg, second assistant; S. W. Niemeyer, of Portsmoutii; Frank Mattern, of Riobmond; O. W. Stone, of Henri, Hunt Jordan, of Halifax, and W. A. Parr, of Amherst, commi te clerks. Tbere will be another caucus of tbe democratic convention on Thursday nigbt to nominate candidates for Sec? retary of tbe Commonwealth, Super? intendent of tbe Penitentiary, Superin? tendent of Poblio Instruction, Slate Treasurer and Railroad Commissioner. The republicans bave three members in tbe Senate and nineteen ia the House, wbicb is a larger representation tbao tbat party has bad in the latter branch for many years. There is no doubt now, it would eeem, tbat tbe legislature will take a recese, after electing those officers Woo must qualify on the 1-tt of Jaouary. Perhaps a few local bills will be passed. Then the General Assembly will wait for tbe constitutional convention to compiete its work. Nearly all tbe members of the legislature eeem to think that tbis General Assembly will be called upoo to pass suob laws as may be necessary to put the new con? stitution into edict. There are members of tbe conven? tion, however, wbo are inclined to the opioion that a new legislature may be elected before tbe new constitution goes into effect. Ooe of tne peculiar efieots of an ad? journment of the legislature before tbe first cf next year, would be tbe In? auguration of Governor Montague witb tne legislature not in session. There seems to be no legal requirement tbat be legislature should be in session when he is tnaUKUrated, although, ae It has generally been in session, tbe pro? gramme has been arraoged with con? sideration of the fact. If tbe legislature is not in session, Governor Montague will embody lo bis inaugural address bis views oo several suojects wbloa, perhaps, would be embraced in a special message If tbe body was to remain in solive work. At tbe present june.ore nothing is definitely decided upon, ana toe programme will be changed to suii the existing circumetaoces on Janu ary 1. 

CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. The Constitutional Convention yes? terday declined to insert in the judi ciary report a requirement tha't tbe judges of the Supreme Court give writ ten reasons for refusing an appeal. An amendment to Section 5, wbicb provides tliatSupremeCourt judges shall be eleote for terms of twelve years by the legislature was opposed by Mr. O'Flaberty, delegating to the people tbe elective power. Ad amendment of similar import, but modified form, was odcred by Mr. Withers. Mr. Carter complied aod Mr. Withers contended tbat it was tbe cor? rect principle to elect judges as at pres? ent >by tbe legislature. He thought to change the system would be to drag tbe judiciary into politics. Mr. O'Flab? erty was reoogoized to speak for his amendment aod had nut concluded wben tbe convention adjourned until today. Tbe convention adopted a resolution to meet today at 3 o'clock in order to let tbe hall be used by the House of Delogates which meets at noon. This means tbat tbe convention and legislature will occupy tbe same build? ing for the short time tbat latter body Is expected to be to session; that tbe convention will meet io its ball durio? tbe morning hours, and tbe House will convene each day after the convention adjourns. Mr. Glass continues indisposed ?nd for tbe preseot, at least, ibe suffrage question will remain in statu quo.
