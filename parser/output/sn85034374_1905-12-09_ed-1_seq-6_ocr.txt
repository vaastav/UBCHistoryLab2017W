The Panama Cartal and the work done also received favorable com ment from hints Space will not allow us to discuss this message in full, so we notice abocc only those things in it which the South is directly interested. Let us here caution every proper ty owner whose granolithic walk has been iv.t down and who has not paid his fifth, or all of its cost, should do so without fail before the 15th of this month. After that date, according to the terms of the contract, the com pany can collect the entire cost of the walk even if the property has to be sold to do so. Don't put off the mat ter. It is too important. Attend to it at once.
