Congressmen Angry. Washington.?Because Secretary of j the Treasury failed to include in his estimates for the next fiscal year the amount that will be needed for the construction of new Federal buildings all over the United States, authoriza tions for which were approved at the lest session of Congress, much ap prehension exists here on tne suDjeci Members of the House, including al most the entire body, are threatening to march to the Treasury Department and make request o? the Secretary that be make an uiditional recom mendation for this purpose. They say that unless this is done it will be impossible for any of the build ings authorized by the last session of Congress to be erected to be provided for this session. The matter is con sidered seriously here. The North Carolina cities that will be affected unless this additional recommendation is made are as fol lows: Charlotte, Raleigh, Washing ton, Reidsville^ Greenville, Hickory, Monroe, Oxford, Hendrsonville, Rocky Mount, Wilkesboro, Tarboro, Winston Salem. Members of Congress who have asked the Secretary for his views on the subject have come away from his office with the firm impression that he is going to stand pat and that he will not estimate for any of the structures authorized by the Senate and House. He does nci think, these Representatives say, that, the Treasury is in any shape just now lu s>uiuu du auuitiuiicLi uiaiu ui ar most $30,000,000. Consequently the members to whom these building appropriations mean a great deal, and this comprises a large majority of the House, are planning a demonstration to induce the Secretary to change his mind. KING COTTON AS AN AVIATOR. Government's Total Estimate Sends Staple Jumping Skyward. New York.?The government's an nual estimate of the cotton crop caused a very shprp advance in prices of all active deliveries, making new high records for the season in the New York market, with Many con tracts selling at 15 l-2c, or 64 points equal to $3.20 per bale above the clos ing figures of the day previous to the announcement. At this price there was sensationally heavy realizing by bull speculators, but the prospect for an American crop of 11,426,000 bales, excluding linters, seemed to be bring ing in buying orders from all direc tions and after a quick break from 15.50 to 15.13 May quickly rallied to 15.30 in an active and excited market. There was a big business right up to the last momeht and the market clos ed firm at a net advance of 37@48 points, with May contracts quoted at 15.30, compared with 14.86, the clos ing price of the neight before. Memphis, Tenn.?Great excitement prevailed on the floor of the Memphis cotton exchange following the an nouncement of the government cotton crop report.

The question of the insanity of Charlton. I it is suggested, is one for the courts. 1 Encouragement at New Orleans. New Orleans.?Bulls in the cotton market received decided encourage ment from the estimate of tho total cotton crop of this season by the De partment of Agriculture.

Important Opinion Given by N. C. Supreme Court. 1 RAILROAD REGULATION HURT-1 j Chief Justice Holds That Require ment to Get Ticket for Mileage is Unreasonable and Void?Fight Coming in Legislature. Raleigh, IS\ C.?The North Caro lina Supreme Court in Harvey vs. Pailnnn<-) fnAm Wllcnn pniintv nrfld tically deals a "knockout" blow to the railroad mileage book regu lations requiring holders to procure mileage tickets in exchange before boarding a train in its "ruling just made. Harvey is a traveling man and attempted at Wilson three or four times to procure a ticket in | exchange 'for mileage, being stood ; aside each time by the agent in or der that he might wait on cash pur chasers of tickets. Finally the train I came without Harvey' having gotten I his ticket. He boarded the train ! with mileage which the conductor I refused to accept, putting him ofT at J the first station. He recovered $2, 500 damages. Now the Supreme Court. Associate Justice Hoke writing the opinion, approves the judgment holding that Harvey had the right, under the cir cumstances, to ride on the mileage. The court would not set aside the verdict as to amount of damages ex cessive, although Justice Brown and Walker, while concurring that the plaintiff should recover, held that the amount awarded was excessive. Chief Justice Walter Clark, in an opinion concurring with Justices Hoke and Manning in the controll ing opinion of the court, holds fur ther that the requirement, that a holder of a mileage book shall ob tain a ticket to exchange is a brejch of faith on the part of the railro.Vils at whose instance the special ses sion of the General Assembly of 1908 was held to raise the passen ger rate to 2 d-2 cents upon the proposition of the railroad corn panics that they would issue mile age books at. 2 cents, meaning. Chief Justice Clark declares, the mileage to which the public had always been accustomed, whereby the mileage had been pulled on the train by the conductor. The Chief Justice also holds that the requ'rement to get I ticket for mileage is unreasonable and void and. becoming heretofore unknown in this State and still un known except in this Slate and a few adjacent States where the prin cipal North Carolina roads extend. It is a notable fact that in the last General Assembly a bill passed the House by a large majority prohibit ing the mileage ticket requirement and that it failed in the Senate by the deciding vote of the presiding officer after a tie vote of Senators. The indications are that the ques tion will be fought all over again during the approaching session. Two Reports on Bullinger. Washington. ?
