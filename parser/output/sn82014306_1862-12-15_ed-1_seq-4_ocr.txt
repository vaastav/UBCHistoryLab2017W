WEEKLY SENTINEL MONDAY. DKCKMBKK l.". Tli lay la I aider. The people if Indiana and Illinois have en grafted in theii Slate Constitutions a clmiee which prohibit the e jlrance of free negroe from other State, aud penalties are aUacbed for a violation of this exclusion. This the people have decreed by a separate oto at the ballot box, and the ma jorittea iu favcr of it were large and overwhelm ing. Id this Hute it was upward of ninety thou and in Illioois nearly as large. The people meant that .1 free negro population was not desirable iu their States, and have snid so with an emphtsis. Their exclusion is absolute, od not to be changed by any legislative enact meat. It stinds till the Constitution itself it changed. Now, if this right is conceded to the people of the free State, is it not hard to force upon the Southern Su te a population from which we our elves) revoli? Mr. Li.xcolk' proclamation not only forces free neroim upon the South, but it liberates a snrvile population in the midst of the whiten, and .ompels the whites there to submit to that which LixcoL'sown State ( Illinoi) rejects. In deciding n lavor of the policy of the proclama tion.do not Republicans condemn theircwn State laws? Are they in favor of changing our State Coosiilulioii, aud permitting free or emancipated negroes to ome here, without let or hindrance? If not, why should they decide for the people ol Kentucky or Tennessee a policy which belongs to tboee Suites alone V Christian voters should consider how far they are acting on the "golden rule," in thus forcing upon other communities that which they have re jecied for themselves Every man will judge of the humanity of a proclamation which gives to Sixteen St tes the right of exclusion, and denies the same -ight to filieen others, equally entitled to a choice. The De nocratic policy of the Union as it was in theon'y one which will bring peace, prosperity and stability to the Government. All else will end in national disgrace, continued civil war, and the bankruptcy of all c I as.-es ol our people. From the Washington Star, Der. 4. One of Secretary Maulon Vit Ullis Suicide of ( apt. Klwood. Xestert-ity morning at about 3 o'clock, one of the attendants of tne prison in Duff (ireen's Row (near the Old Capitol Prison.) where prisoners arrested by order of the Secretary of War are confined, went to the room where Captain John Et wood, -f the regular army, was kept, carrying the latter s food, when he found him lying on the floor. deid, having two severe tuis on etch side of bis thro it, which were inflicted by an or dinary pocket knife held tightly in one of his hands; the corp.-e was cold and -Ml' wren found, the act having probably taken place some hours before. The fi.ct was at once reported to the War De partmetr., and yesterday afternoon Col. Dostor, Provost Marshal, requested that the usual in quest be held. The Coroner accordingly sum moned jury, and last evening, after bearing the evidence of persons about the prison know ing anything of the circuinatunces ot" the af fair, a verdict was returned saying that he came to his death from wounds uiflii ted by his own band. Capt. Elwood entered the regular army from civil lit';, being appointed from Ohio. Up to six weeks u, since the beginning of the war. he had beeu dtiiig duty in connection with receiving, sweurit g in, and disposing of the recruits 1 cach ing here from time to time, including swearing in entire legimeuts uot sworn in previous to reach ing tti: - city. In t te dischaige of these duties, about six weeks yefbre his death, he was arrested by an officer of the Provosi Mar-hal of the War De partment, charge), it is said, (though no charge again-, him lias, so far, been made public, that we bat e heard of, with peculation iu collusiou with the claim agency firm of Jlell k Glosser one an old Paymaster's clerk, and the other an old Quartermaster's clerk to defraud the Gov ern meat in making pa v men's to them 011 Gor ernraeot account. From the moment of his arrest, according to what s said to-day around us, he was, by order, placet in solitary confinement, and was not per mitted to -ee any one up to the time of his sui cide, except the servant or attendant carrying him 'tis metis We do not, however, know whet! er this is true or no'. The late Captain Eiwood was .1 man of great indus.ry, of apparently modest and retiring man ners ati.l habits, though by no means a person of sharp and quick intellect. Those who knew him well ill be loth indeed to entertain the belief that te has been unfaithful to any trust imposed ou him, though they will not wonder if it shall turn out that he has been defrauded in m iking payments ou Government account H'! was certainly a person of teeming delicacy of sentiment, Mich as might induce him, without conr-e!. nri' e opportunity to m ike any effort to resc le his reputation from the disgrace of the situ: tioo iu which he found him.-ell, to resort, as he did, to suicide. Only three week ago we learned of his arrest, and then, lor the first time, the fact was made pob ic, if we remember correctly, through the Stai. P. S We see it statel by the correspondent of a Philadelphia paper that the de eased con fessed his guilt during his confinement. Iiis frie ids, however, who yet believe firmly in his innocence, utter I v discredit the story. General Rank' Kxpedilion Hrrakitlg the Backbone ol Ihr Rebellion. We gave an account in our vostortlay' paper of the parting ovation made to General Banks on bis departure from our shores at the head of a gnat -tnd formi'iabie armament if r-tenia j this great ex petition, on wiihh are founded so many hopes and expectation, look its departure lor, it pie-cnt. part- unknown Ii m stugular, and we deem it lortunate, that hith Orto the destination of this expelitiou has been kept a profound secret. It has now set sail, either for Kichmoud, or Charleston, or Mobile, or Texas; but 10 which ol ihse pUces no one eaa tell. It cau only be told ältere it is not go iu . The remarks of Governor Curtin, of Pennsyl vania, at the leave taking referred to. if not in dicative of the destination of this expedition, are ate at least significant and suggestive. He ob served that "to crush this rebellion it was neces airy to strike a, the heart of their rebellious country, to purge the viper's nest; or, in short, U' Uke Richmond, the Capital of the so called CoafeJerate States. An expeiiiion to 1 exas euld do no good at the pre-eut lime, and until Richmond was taken we could m t ho; to put an ad to the rebellion or expect the restoration of t te Union. This is no trifling affiir, and hereto fire we have failed because we have uot as stead i y and earnestly engaged in the work as w shout-;." For our own part, we have all along I el iet id that its destination is Richmond. At all events, if it is not, we think that ii ought tobe When Commodore Vanderbiit rose to speak, General Banks is said to have remarket: "He is the only man who knows where the expelitiou is We ri. retrain gre..t hopes for the results of this ixpei'.tioii, from the known and approved char trier of the (et. er.

It has beeu aid of General Buk, by those competent to judge, thai he is the gieatest general officer that baa beeu uken from the ranks of civil life He poa.e., also, what the Romans, iu their super stition, deemed the highest and most necer quality of a General "good luck " He has been hitherto eminently felix, or lucky, in all his under takings. At Cedar Mountain, during the short and unfortunate campaign of General Pope, he neceasfuSly withstood with his division the furi osi onslaught of the whole of Stonewall Jack son's rebel army; and his prudent and successful retreat on a previous occasion along the valley of the Shenandoah, in which he brought ofl his aray safe! v. even to its baggage, ia worth of being compared with the famous retreat of Mo reau, and is equal to that of Xenopheo and his famous ten thou sand in ancient history. We heartily join in the general feeling of the pablic in winning unalloyed succeas to this, the greatest ext edition which ever left our Northern shore. We look for solid result fiom its action aa lern than the taking of Rk mood, while Lee and hi army are quietly detained at Fredericks berg no leva than outflanking the enemv, taking them in 1 heir tear while Bums.de is In their front, leaving them no chance of retreat or escape, and obliging them to surrender, aud thus effectually breaking the very backbone of the rebellion. Who can tell whether General Banks may not tarn out, after all, to be ibe Napoleon of the age, whom the nation ha so long been looking fesr? (Hew York Herald. 6tb. CO G K Eft I ON A L. aasaa W ashimotox. December 8. Hoist -The Speaker announced the appoint ment of Mr. Mi'i'her-on to fill the vacancy on the Military Committee in place ot Blair, of Missouri; aud Lea man, of the same committee, in plat col Jiick.-on, deceased Messrs. Passenden and Walker were apixiitited to till vacancies on the Committee ou Private Land Claims Other standing committees remain as hereto fore. The Speaker appointed the following gentle men as a special committee to investigate the charges derogatory to the standing of Mr Ashley, as published in the Toledo Blade and other pa pers named: Blakeof Ind., Noell of Mo., Casev of Ky .Haixhtol N. Y. Mr. W ickliffe introduced a bill for the protec tion and relief of loyal citixeus whose property and slaves have been seixel by officers ol the United Slates Referred to the Judiciary Com mittee. Other business of minor importance was trans acted. Mr Stevens offered a series of resolutions re ferringthe various parts of the President's ines sage to appropriate committees Mr Richardson severely criticised the message, urging thai most of it was about the negro and nothing about the bravery of our soldiers. On motion of Mr Edmonds, it was resolved thai the Committee on Indian Affairs be in structed to inquire whether any further legisla tion is necessary iu relation to Indian lunds held bv Government, and report by bill or otherwise. On motion of Roscoe Coukling, the President was requested, if in his opinion it was not incom patible with the public interest, to transmit to the House the last official report of Gen. Buell. Mr. Van Wyck introduce! a bill to provide for the immediate payment of clothing lost in service by soldiers of the United States army. Also a bill increasing the pa? ol privates, non-commis sionel officers and musicians. Both bills were referred to the Committee on Military Affairs. Mr. Stevens introduced a bill to indemnify President Lincoln and other persons for suspend ing the privileges ol the writ ol habeas corpus, and lor all acts done iu pursuance thereof. The hill is the same as that offered last week. Mr. Tallaudighatn objected to the reading of the bill. Under the rules the question occurrel, shall the bill tic rejectei? The House refused to reject 34 against 90. The b-,1 1- then re id a second time. Mr. Stevens moved to postpone ibe further con siderationof the bill till next Thursday, and make it the special order for that day. Mr Vallandigham oljectcd. Mr Cox desired to refer it to the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Stevens then asked that the bill lie put on its passage. The main question was ordered 81 to 47. Mr Olin expressed surpri-e that any objection should be made to postponement when an oppor tunity lor its discu-sion could be itffordel. If postponed until Thursday, it could be examined with the care and wisdom which the House should bring to bear upon the subject. What he objected especially to was that a measure of such great importance, and upon which thtre was such diversity of opinion, should be hurt ieily thrust through the House. The Pres dent had authori ty by law to exercise all the power he had ex ercisel with regard to the writ of habeas corpus He concurred with the gentlemen from Pennsyl vania (Stevens) th l a bill of this character was proper; but while he thus concurred, he should regret to -ee the bill hurried through without members knowing its legal prov.sions. It was discreditable to the House and country. He should be ashamed to return to his constituents and say that Congress h id pas.-ed an act w ithout permitting a word, yea or nay, to be said on the subject He hoped, for the crelit of the House and thecountrv, that the matter would be post poned. Mr. Vallandigham stid he had objected only to the bill being made the spe-ial order. Mr Colfax differed from the gentleman from Ohio; he did not think the immediate passage of the bill would be discreditable to the House. In stead of this, it would be creditable. This ques I tion has been discussed all over the land, whether 1 the President has power to suspend the writ of ! habeas corous during the rebellion. He stood ready to vote for the bill to indemnify him He hopel the bili would pass at once. Mr. Stevens was about addressing the House on the subject, when Mr. Yitllandigham raised a question that Mr. Stevens had no right, under the rules, to do so. Mr. S. evens asket for three minute- to ex plain. Mr Vallandigham objected unless others hare a similar privilege. Mr. Holman moved' to lay the bill on the table. L'.-t 4ö to tG. Mr Stevens explained. It was not his inten tion to put the bill on its passage, but a postpone men was prevented. Massachusetts desire! an amendment that those who had been illegally im prisonel might have their remedy. Mr Stevens, in fuither explanation, said he double! the authority of the President to sus ft$$i the writ of habeas corpus except Iroin ab solute necessity during the recess of Congress. He held that Congress was the sovereign power, and not the President. The bill passed 90 against 45. Senate Messrs Foster. Sumner, Dixon, La th int. Fessenden. Grimes and King, severally presented petitions in favor of a general bankrupt act. Mr Wright presentel .1 memorial from Gover nor Morton, of Indiana, prat ing for an increase of pay to common soldiers Referred to the Committee on Military Affairs. Mr Ne-miili offered a icsolut:on instructing the Secretary of War to report to the Senate the ! number and ranks of Aid de Camps appointed I under the act of Augu-t, 61 : also, the number ; and rank of those appointed, drawing pay and j not iu active sen ice.

Brigadier itenerals now iu the service of the United Slates, and where and how they are em ployed. Mr 5umner offered a resolution that the call upon the Secretary -if Wir for c nes,! mdem e and matter relating to the Armv of the Poto . mtc, be exten h-d so a- to embody all operations I since the hrsi movement ot that army, which was adopted. Mr. Latham introduced a bill to provide for developing the mineial resources of the United States. Relerrel. Mr. Siu'sbury - ilied up the resolution re laling to the arrest of certain citizens Mr Wilson, of Massachusetts, objected. Mr. Bayard urgef the adoption of the resolu tion. Mr. Doolittle said that iu all the cases of rr i rest offers of liberty had been made it the : prisoners arrested would take the oath of al ' legiance. He would like to have the resolution lie over. Mr. Saul-bury said that he had referred to these two persons bec.iue iie had r.ever heard I any charges against them; they had been arrest ' rested iu a loyal Slate, and for 110 offense what j ever. He thought they had at least the right to ex imme into the m itter. I nere was no uisposi lion to opuose the Government at all. After further discussion, the Chair announced (he apeeMl order to be the bankrupt act, which was informally laid aside. Mr. Fessenden, from the Committee on Fi nance, reported a bill concerning judgments in certain suiia brought by the Uuilee States, which was amended and passel. The bankrupt bill was then taken up and post ! poned. and m ide the special order of ihe day for t Thursday, the Itiili iust. Mr. Davis offered a joint resolution proposing j certain amendments to the Constitution to alter ; the mode of electing the President and Vice 1 President; that the President and Vice President be elected iu the following manner; Each State miv within 30 davs next before the time appointed for election of President, in any mode adopted by th State, nominate to Congress one candidate, and on the first Monday of February next before the expiration of each Presidential term, the two Houses of Congress shall meet together as a convention of the House of Repie nenuiives. and all the candidates nominate! by the States within the ttreceediug 30 dais, uot exceelini; one bom each State, wnose noui" nation shall have been iiutheniica'ed to Conuress, hall be before said convention as can didates for the Presidency; and thereupon said convention shall proceed, under the supervision of the presiding officers of the two House, to vote, bv open ballot, from among said candidates for President; and, when any one shall have re ceived a number of votes equal to all the mem Iters elected and appointed by both Houses of Congress, he shall be declare! by the President of the Senate to be elected President of the United States In all case where balloting shall have continue! in this mode five days without election, and none being effected on the t.xth, it shall be resumed, and after each ballot the officers pre siding shall drop the candidate who ha received the smallest number of voles, or two or more candidates who have received an equal number of votes and lea than all th others; and the ballot ing shall be so cODiinued among the remaining candidates utitil one shall receive the majority foresaid, and thereupon ihe President of the Senate shall anuouiice him to be elected Piasi ilent ol the Unite! State-, the Contention shall then proceed in the same manner , from among the remaining candidates, t elect a Vice-President of the Ullited S -.- Whenever it mav ov-cur in the balloting for President or Vice President, that all the candidates but two have been dropped, balloting between them may, if necessary to make an election, continue two days longer, and if then no candidate shall have receive! the required number of votes, the officers presiding over the Coutentio.i shall report the state of facta to the Supreme Court of the United Slates, and it shall thereupon pronounce which of the two candidates shall fill the office. The resolution was ordere! to be printed. After executive session, adjourned. Washisoto.m, December 9. Senate The Chair laid before the house a communication from the secretary of War in answer to a resolution calling for information in relation to the sale of colored freemen captured by the tehels, kc. The reply of Secretary Stanton states that no information on the subject is in possession of the War Department. Mr Sherman presentel a petition in favor ol a general bankrupt act Mr. Davis presented two petition protesting against the action of the Advisory Board of the Navy. Mr. Sumner, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, lej .'i ted a bill for the relief of the owners of the French vessels Inles aud Kt Marie. Mr. Anthony, from the Committee on Print ing, reported a bill to increase the bonds of the Superintendent of Printing. Mr. Hale introduce! a bill to abolish the grade of meiical officers in the service of the United State. The resolution offered by Mr. Spaulditip rela tive to the arbitrary arre.-t of citizens of Dela ware was taken up. Mr Hale said the Senator from Delaware (Mr. B.tard) ye-tenlav referred to a proper division of power as being the hope of a free Government; and he (II ne) was not willing to see the Senate interfere with other Derailment. If any citi xens of Delaware had been aggrieved, ihe courts were still open Hcbelicted the writ ot habeas corpus tta- not de id vet He acknowledged this was an embarrassing question Mr Hit anl said tlicrs was no such division of Government power. The judiciary was always the weakest. The President has asserted the right to suspend the writ ol habeas corpus, and he th'tught it proper for the Senate to inquire into the matter. Mr Wilson, of Mass , -aid doubtless every body regretted the necessity of making these ar rests iu this country. The President regretted it as much as anybody. He did not think any loyal man could charge the President with wantonly violating the right of citizens for a long time. The leading traitors sat here, but no arrests were made. When they were commissioned they were necessary, and the first artest was lor seli- I ing gun caps to the enemy. He, for one, thankel the President for making these irrest. It was a powerful means of pre serving the Government, and he hopel the Presi dent and his advisers would not shrink from ar re-ting ant man who shows probable cause ot be ing in league with the rebels. There was never a rebellion w here so much consideration had been shown, and so much humanity for traitors. Mr. Siulsbury did nol doubt that there were arre-ts made wh ch w ere justifiable; but these men were citizens of Delaware, who.-e loyalty was never questioned. The motion to lay on the table was disagree! to by a vote of 3 yeas to 40 nays. Mr. Field said he should vote against the reso lution. He was of opinion that the President had the right to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. The trainers of the Constitution evidently in tended that the habeas corpus might be suspendel in time of insurrection or invasion, and he thought ii was clearly an Executive act. He was of the opinion that if any complaiut was to be made it was that the Government had been too lenient to traitors. Mr. Bayard continued at length, saying that the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus was nol an executive act. If this was admitted, aud legislative power had no right to inquire, then the President might imprison men, or tor ture them, or do as he pleased w itli them. Mr. Sherman lavored the adoption of all these resolutions of inquiry, which were offered in good faith. He believed ihe right to suspend the writ of habeas corpus was purely a legislative power, aud it could only be done by Congress; but since the legislation oflr.st Congte-s the President has had power git en to him. He thought many of these arrests were great mistakes; and every ar rest ought to be reportel to Congress, and the reasons for it. If the power was unlimited, the Government would bee 111 e oppressive. The people have been exasperate i at the manner ol tht.-e arre-is and di-cliarges. and it was due to the country and ju-lice that no man should be ar rester for light cause. The cause ami charge should be projerlv explainel Congress had a perfect right to call for information that they may go betöre the people, aud be able to explain and defend these arrest.-. Mr Trumbull -aid that as he could not see any practical benelit to be obtained in passing these resolutions, he was inclined to vote against them He '.bought the arrests had been unfortu nate and impolitic. Judges, and courts, and commeutitors have held that the power of -u--peodiug the writ of habeas corpus was a iegis lative power It is not from any sympathy with U a i tors that there iä great feeling upon this sub ject, but be-aiife it is fen-el it is an exercise of an unnecessary and arbitrary power. He would say to his friend. (Wilson) who gloried in these arrests, that there was vet v great danger in them; 1 there was a bill now before the house 1 dative to this very subject, and he was in favor of acting upon that as a practical measure. Mr Powell said the President had no right to nuke these arrest or to suspend the writ, and doing so was usurpation. The people have de filled that these arrests should cease. There cent elections showed this. Mr Wilson okaiaied that no such question waa settled by the ele-tioiis. The nlt thing settled was thai the Republican p rtt could not raise men enough to send to the field lo whip South eru traitors and still have men enough at home to vote down Northern Democrats. Tint's all that was -euled. The discussion continue! at length. Pending the questian the Sen ite adjourned. Hoise Mr. Conway siid he did not regard the proposition, as now pre-ented, as having re ceive! ilie assent require! by the Constitution. Western Virginia was not a lawful Slate He believed it was the intention of the President to encourage State organizations in all Ihesecelei Slates, but placing the assumption of the State in the hand of a few individuals appointed by the President was flagrant and unconstitu tional The scheme wa- 1 evolutionary and ought to beexposel to the reprobai'on of every loyal citizen It would be an utter perversion of our stem. It would iu effect concentrate all the power of the Government in the hands of the Kxecutive. Mr Brown, of Virgini 1, repliel, arguing that the ere tion o.'' the Sute of We-tem Virginia was perfe-ily lawful aud constitutional. The provision of the Constitution iu regard to the ad-un-sion or erection of new Stales had been com pliel with, und in ibis connection he qn.ited as similar the preamble and act admitting Ken tuckv, whit h was funned from p-.rt ol Virginia. Precedents, he iu-i-ted, supported the new Slate organization Mr. Mil lory said: I understand that more thin half the counties of Virginia were not te, te . sentei in the Wheeling Legi-lature. Mr Blair, of Virginia, asked if all the coun i ties were not int iteiT Mr Biown All were expressly invited. Mr. Mallory Although they we-e invited, were ! not so me of them so completely withiu the con trol of foreign Governments they could not send 1 representatives to the Legislature? Mr. Brown I can t say whether the pe ple were under intimidation or not. It is sufficient to say they were invited to come. If they staid away it was their fault, not ours. Ifiheywere disloyal they could have no voice in the Legisla tuie of Virginia. Helbre Mr. Brown conclude! the morning hour had expire!, when the !! ;- took up the special ! older authorizing Assessors and Collet tor- and their assistants, under the lax law, to administer oaths, kc. Mr. Brown resumed his remarks in advocacy of the bill for the admission of the Slate of West ern Virginia. He stale! various considerations why th Slate should lie admitted; the petple of that section hail been struggling lor forty years for a separate existence; they now had sixteen regiments in ihe field obtained by volunteering, not by draft. Mr Colfax remarked that at the last session he had great doubts as to the propriety of pasting this bill, but on examination his mind was mad. up that it ought to pass. Mr. Crittenden appreciated the patriotism and ardor of the people of Western Virginia, and the desire ihey expressed to become a free people; but in this matter he was not governed by feeling, but by the principles of constitutional law. Congress could not admit a new State out of the ancient territory. without the consent of the old Common wealth, and this had not been given. If Stales should be made in the method proposed, new ones could be made at ideasure, inesectit e of the Constitution of Ihe United State Mr. Edwards said be would sustain he loyal people If there was no other way be would seize the rebellious portions, hold them and their territory, ant! repopulale them Mr. Wvckliffe You seak about repopula ting Virginia. What would you do with the people? Would you exterminate, kill or make slates of themT Mr Edwards If necessary I would extermi nate the whole people in order to preserve the integrity of the U.ion. Mr. Wickliffe Women and children? Mr. Edwards No; they are uot found in arms. This unintentional pun gave rise to general laughter. They are entitle! to the protection of every civilize! peipie of the world. Mr. Mat nard sooke of his finding patriotic and loyal people in Western Virginia begging to be disenthral le! and relieve! from the dead carcass of Eastern Virginia. It would be unjust to keep them waiting until our armv should comel the other pari of the State to ohelience. Mr. Stevens said it waa mockery to hold that the Legislature of Virginia had ever assented lo the new State. With his consent the Union could never be restored as it was under the Constitution with slavery. Without concluding the House adjourned. W asiiimoTO, December 10. House Mr. Holman, of Indiana, submitted a resolution, which was adopted, that the Secre tary of War be directed to inform the House. 1st, How mmy commissioned officers of the army are now absent from their respective commands, specifying the number of each grade, and wheth er absent without leave or bv leave or detail; 2d, I he number of Major Generals and Brigadier Generals who are not assigned 10 any actual com mai'd, the name of each, the length of time since engaged iu actual service, and the names of the members of the staffs of each of such Generals, their grades, and how long since employ el iu ac tual service, and specifying only sin h Generals and members of their respective staff's as are re ceiving their pay and allowances from the dep in ment; aud the number of Aide de Camp which may bedispeusel with without imp dring the pub lie service.
