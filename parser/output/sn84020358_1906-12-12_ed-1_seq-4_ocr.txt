A sixty-etght-acre lot of abandoned land In Pennsylvania was bought last spring for $1,700. On twenty acres of it 4,300 buBhels of potatoes were raised this sea son, which sold for $2,400. Under the heading "Numerical Co incidences," the Milwalkee Free Press writes: "Three hundred is the number of the colored troopers dischareed un heard "by President Roosevelt; and 300 Is the number of good English words put out of service, also without a hearing or a word of protest until the deed was done." Sir Thoma3 Llpton says: "I have traveled In practically all the civilized countries of the world and do not hes itate to assert that, whether in a hotel, a railroad train, a street car or any where else, there Is no place in the world where a woman Is safer, more respected or better protected than in the United States." This, perhapa It will be noticed, includes Fair Haven. These are Inquisitive times. A snail's rate of travel was ascertained by ex periments in Florence. Half a dozen snails were permitted to crawl between two points ten feet apart. Exact time was kept from the start to the finish, ' and thus the average pace was learn ed. . The figures were then put Into tables of feet, yards and furlongs, and it was found that it would take a snail exactly fourteen days to travel a mile. Paraflln wax models of all proposed British battleships are used by the Ad miralty for teste before the keels of the ships are laid down, the miniatures being tested In a great tank. The models are from twelve to twenty four feet long, the tank being 400 feet long and twenty feet wide. The mod els are made of wax because it Is a material which does not absorb water or change its weight, so that altera tions can 'be easily made, and the ma terial can be melted up and u?ed asaln. The American naval authori ties also have models of all their hulls constructed, but these are much more elaborate than the British, being form ed of white pine and fitted with rud ders, false keels, propeller shafts and nil etcetras. ' In a letter to the Lancet Dr. Ranking, of Oxford, tells of the use of frog skin for grafting. "For more than twenty years," says the physician, "the frog has furnished me with grafts In all cases requiring such treatment. My first use of it was in my own case. I had suffered for nearly three years from obstinate ulceration of the skin of the foot, which had resisted all treat ment and steadily refused to heal. I began using grafts of frog skin li the middle of January, 1885, and in less than six weeks had a sound covering of skin. At the present time, more than twenty years having elapsed, the cica trix Is perfectly sound, and has none of the puckering and stiffness so often seen in cicatrices where human grafts have been used." Dr. Ranking was so encouraged by this result that he used frog skin in every case of the kind aft er that, and -at a rough estimate must have used it in some three hundred or four hundred cases. "Who is the little man talking to the political boss over there?" "That's Justasgood, the druggist." "What does he want?" "He wants to have the prohibition Jaw passed by the next legislature." "But how can that benefit him?" "Eh! Didn't I juet tell you he was a druggist?" Cleveland Plain Dealer. J Knicker When do you take the eavy meal of the day? Rocker When my wife cooks it. NOT XX A CIL T A I U I K These are interesting days, and we are slowly finding out what's what and who's who. A grand Jury Jn Danville, Virginia, that found an indictment against a miniature combination of coal and wood dealers ."engaged in criminal conspiracy to Interfere with the trade of the citizens of Danville" was unable to return a true bill against a so-called lawyers' trust, otherwise the Danville Bar Association, which was similarly charged with being an unlawful combination. The fact chat an agreement exists among the. local attorneys to control legal fees and that fixes a minimum scale for services is not disputed, but it is held that' legal steps for breaking up the conspiracy could not be taken because the trust does not deal in the necessities of, life. Is law a luxury? Many who have had experience with It don't seem to think so. lei's xrr 

THEM J.V. The President sent another message to congress yesterday, and it was 6uch a short one that everybody can and many will read it. In his long message the other day he said American citizen ship should be conferred on the citizens of Porto Rico. Now he says it again in the following winged words: I most earnestly hope that this will be done. I cannot see how any harm can possi bly result from it, and it seems to me a matter of right and justice to the peo ple of Porto Rico. They are loyal, they are glad to be under our flag, they are making rapid progress along the path or orderly liberty. Surely we should show our appreciation of them, our pride in what they have done, and our pleasure In extending recognition for what has been done, by granting them full American citizenship. The Porto Ricans have certainly be haved well and shown themselves ap preciative of our benevolence and beneficence. There 'doesn't seem to be any good reason why they should not be good Americans In fact as well as in behavior. Let's grant them the grand est privilege on earth. 

SOWH BLIXD JUSTICE. A recent occurrence in Warsaw indi cates that justice there is sometimes pretty blind. Frank Rowokowski was arrested and charged with having com mitted a crime of which he said he was guiltless. At the hearing witnesses said that he had committed the deed, and he was promptly convicted. Two weeks later he was brought to court again, ac cording to the custom of the land, to hear the ''reasons for the sentence." Before going to court he' agreed to ex change places with another prisoner, and 'to demonstrate how easy It was to punish an innocent man. Luclan Zim ny, with whom he changed places, had been accused of theft, and when the name was called Rowokowski came for ward. A woman looked at the prison er and swore that he was the culprit, although he appeared to be somewhat stouter than he was v.'hen she saw him last. Two other witnesses testified against him, and when he was asked what defense he could offer the man explained the situation. The fate of the prisoners Is not told, but a report er recommends the Rowokowski case to the "consideration of judges who lis ten to witnesses." This ought to be an eye-opener to the judge most concerned, and to other judges as well. THE TTSMAllRttSG 6I1I1.S. Now the talk Is on again that college women don't marry enough, or, to be more precise, that enough of them don't marry. William L. Felter, an educator of Brooklyn, thinks that girls don't get the right education in their colleges. He thinks the courses In women's col leges have been too closely patterned after those of institutions for men. He insists that the women's colleges are maintained for the direct benefit of a small minority, the peculiarly gifted the future authors, musicians, painters and teachers while, the majority pur sue the identical courses, with no spe cific modifications looking to their ac tual destiny wifehood and motherhood. Mr. Felter would have the main aim of study for girls In high schools and col leges "the cultivation of health. Healthfulness and holiness are synony mous." Mathematics, which he consid ers a severe strain on the average girl or woman if shs does It well, he would teach only in Its rudiments. Some household chemistry he recommends, with elementary physics, largely de scriptive. A little physical geography, geology,, astronomy and botany would be included, while 2oology and morph ology are emphasized, sociology and political economy should find their place, and art in all its forms should not be overlooked. Mr. Felter suspends judgment on the elimination of ancient tongues, but urges abundant study of English and other modern languages, especially conversation. He adds ped agogy, child study and nursing. Right enough as far as It. goes per haps, but how can educated girls be fairly expected to marry the kind of men that are lying around with em phasis on the lying? Furthermore, how can uneducated girls be expected to? Let us have some talk about mak .Charge of the Orthographic Brigade. Half a word, half a word, Half a word sundered.

Spare Moments. THE MAKING AND SHARING OF FORTUNES. The late. Russell Sage entered Wall street at the age of fifty and left a fortune of about eighty millions for Mrs Sage to distribute. At an age when most people prefer leisure, she has put upon herself a task which was meant in all kindness, but is after all one of the most trying and disappoint ing which one at any age can under take. The business of accumulating riches j The Value of a Gift is not only measured by its intrinsic worth, but by the dis play of taste and judgment in selection. CLBEAUTIFUL FORMS are not made or selected by chance, but are the result of ability, combined with long experience and study CLHOWEVER INEXPEN SIVE the article, the name on the box or wrapper frequently conveys not only a guarantee of genuineness, but unquestion ed merit. 1 Site ffiorft Jr. "THE QUEEN HAS CONSTANTLY and STEADILY INCREASED In Popularity and Esteem, and is ACCEPTED THROUGHOUT the ENTIRE CIVILIZED WORLD as The IDEAL and PERFECT TABLE WATER. is one thing; the task of distributing it so that it may do less harm than good is another. Of the twp tasks, the former is undoubtedly the easier of the two. The hard-headed business man has simply to organize his re sources and keep multiplying his op erations, and his results are sure, un der ordinary conditions, to turn out advantageously. But when jit conies to breaking : up accumulated millions among those who are worthy, there are few who are prepared to do it Justly to all concerned. The parties concerned are not sim ply the donor and the recipient. The community has a right to exemption from a distribution of wealth which demoralizes the spirit of Industry and frugality, because, as Poor Richard was wont to say, these lead to wealth And self-earned cents are, as a rule better than donated dollars. Any distribution of a fortune which puts a premium on indolence is de moralizing. Whether It be the gilded youth, the lazy glutton, or the "ramb ling rake of poverty." who receives it, the effect is much the same. Honest industry, modest living and a share in the essential duties of citizenship are all weakened wherever the oppo site vices are fostered by unwise di vision of wealth. It may not be wise to enact any more lav3 on this matter just now. But popular thought should not de ceive Itself into thinking that any kind of distribution is a good thine. Many of them are not only not good uses of wealth, but are positively nuisances to the community., This is one of the dangers of the present time. The ideal distribution of a fortune whether great or small should look to a greater equalization of riches, and at the same time pre serve rather than imperil all that is best in individual worthiness.
