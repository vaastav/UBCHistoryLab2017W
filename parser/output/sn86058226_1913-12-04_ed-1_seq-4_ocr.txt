The President's Message "Social justice comes first": this is the key note of President Wilson's message to the Sixty third Congress which went into regular session last Monday, a document that maintains the high standards of simple and lucid language so characteristic of his utterances. We are moving toward world peace, he says in substance, and the United States is rightfully in the lead. If we wish for a standard by which to test all arbitration and treaty making we have it in "Our own honor and our obligation to the peace of the world." But a great menace to our peace lies in that cloud which has long hung over Mexico. Vic toriano Huerta is but a pretender at best and has lately come forth boldly as a mere dictator. Urrtil he is eliminated, Mexico can have no peace. We have adopted the policy of "watchful wait ing." Developments have justified this attitude and we may confidently expect to see this un just dictatorship crumble of its own weight. Meanwhile we have urgent problems of our own, foremost at this time among which is the currency question. It is necessary that every other matter be laid aside by Congress that both bodies may concentrate all their energies on this. That done the next necessary step will be to arrange to give farmers some adequate form of credit. The producers of our food are necessary above all others, yet they do not stand on an equal footing in the credit market with the for ester and the miner. Of course we shall grant them no special privileges, but we must give them their due. We have long lagged behind European nations in this, but the Congressional Committee appointed some time since to inquire into foreign methods of agricultural credits is about ready to report and will then enable us, doubtless, to frame suitable legislation. But the large task confronting us is the fur ther prevention of monopoly. The Sherman law should stand, but the debatable ground that sur rounds it must be reduced by more specific legis lation. This is so important a problem a special message will be needed concerning it. The President then speaks in behalf of the direct nomination of candidates for the presi dency. He believes that political conventions should be held after nomination and should in clude all those candidates who are made respon sible in carrying out a party's platform. The executive message then sweeps out to our insular possessions and lays down the doctrine that we are not owners, but trustees of these is lands and that our policy should make steady progress towards their full and complete self government. Alaska, also, needs attention and should be given a well rounded territorial government. Means for supplying an outlet to her vast stores of minerals must also be found: for this a gov ernment built and operated railway is best fitted. Also steps must be taken to prevent private mo nopolizing and exploitation of Alaskan resources. His special recommendations covered a plea for a more adequate equipment of the Bureau of Mines, for a railway employers' liability act, and for measures looking to safety at sea. He closes by congratulating Congress on its energy and its progressive spirit and promises his own hearty co-operation in all these matters of importance to the nation. Former-President Roosevelt was greatly pleased with a cartoon exhibiting a work-worn farmer reading "his favorite book" a copy of the president's message. We believe the same farmer and all the rest of us besides will take as much pleasure in this present message as in any preceding ones. TheS erpent's Tongue Here's a story from Kansas City. A certain man came home from a hunting trip, found that a personal friend while at a par ty held in his own home had kissed his wife, sharpened up his knife with calm deliberateness. walked across the street to this friend's home, stabbed him to death, and is now confined in a prison cell. A thrilling story, is it not? and food for the dime novelists. But here's the key to the situation: "But one of the women who was there had to tell all about it. She told someone and they told someone else and it got into the shop where Mr. C works. There a man gossiped too and he told Mr. C ." This is a fragment from the story told by the unfortunate murderer's wife before the coroner's jury. In her account the facts were divulged which were like this: She was entertaining a few friends and neigh bors oneevening to while away the long hours during her husband's vacation. It happened that one of the men had been drinking and at tempted to kiss her. It was about this the wom an told. The wife refrained from telling her husband for fear he might, because of the sting of the insult, attempt violence. "But one of the women who was there had to tell all about it. . . . A man gossiped, too." And by the time the story reached the hus bai:! the tale had become so twisted he was told his dearest friend and neighbor had vilely in cited his wife. And the man killed his friend. A Matter of Teeth Everything about the human animal from the tip of his hair to the toes of his foot is receiving the attention of savants and the offices of a con vention. Therefore we are not surprised to learn of the deliberations of a conference in Toledo in which, for the forty-eighth time, the Ohio State Dental society is endeavoring to preach the gos pel of good teeth. In view of the conditions there revealed, forty-eight more conventions will be needed prop erly to attend to the dentition of the Buckeye state. The school children of that great com monwealth, according to the doctors, are in a bad way, fully one-half having defective teeth. So serious is this condition it is estimated that these defectives require, on an average, one-half year longer to pass the first eight grades than sound youngsters. This means that dental caries is an imme diate economic issue in any state where there may be this loss of school time. If we estimate that every child costs per school year thirty dol lars, and that, we imagine, is below the level, it costs the state for every 5,000 defective children $75,000. That sum would more than pay for proper care of the teeth even if the state were to receive no more benefit than the saving in school xpenses. But it would receive returns far greater than that. Teeth are a national asset. Dental caries is one of the first evidences of racial decay. When the teeth go, all other maladies are close behind. Dr. Osier, often spoken of as America's greatest physician, has said, "If I were to select any one point in personal hygiene more import ant than any other, I should unhesitatingly se lect the care of the teeth. Bad teeth means dis eased organs sooner or later and that in turn means decreased vitality, low efficiency and un happiness." Bad teeth are a handicap in every way. They serve as breeding grounds for all manner of bac teria; they make difficult thorough mastication of food, so essential to good health; they give one a malodorous breath; they spoil one's good looks, and transform the mouth into a sewage sink. The necessary thing, of course, is right train ing of children. We grownups are too far gone to be able to do much with ourselves. But to fix in a child the invariable habits of mouth hy giene is to do for it a service of inestimable worth. It is just as important to send the little ones regularly to the dentist as to send them to Sunday-school.
