Tm policemen stepped from the vefutue bearing a stretcher. Ob the ean ni lay a man with white face and closed ryes, a corpse-like object in the half-light. The door opened swiftly and smoothly, and a gal ia the uniform of the hospital nurses appeared and the officers hurried m With their gmesome burden. Presently iht? emerged and climbed mic the ambu lance and drove away. "A cool little woman that," said one el them. "One of the finest," said the tine-coat Who had been addressed. The next morning Frank Hamilton woke with a duli turn in ha left aide that bronchi hack the night before when he had been eangbt between the cars in the switchyard. : He remembered the face of the night nurse, a pale face with dark eyes and iramed keavily with the duskiest of tresses. The is; curse was a little slip of a blonde who slipped around m the corridors and halia of the hospital aa unobtrusively as a mouse. Hamilton waa of pood family, but was "down on ha .fuck" from rash speculation, and had accepted a job hi the railroad yards rather than write home far money. He was of an impulsive nature, and rathe emotional and hopeful than a man able to stand steadDy up against misfortune. He waited curiously for the night nurse to make her appearance. Presently she came, and he noted that she took no more interest m him than she seemed to take is an old man who lay in the sane room with him. Her attitude and cemeanor were strictly professional, very calm and self-possessed, and she looked snd remind ed him somehow of a serene and fair lily. "How badly am I hurtf he asked her. TSot seriously, she replied. '4lts merely a shock and a bruise, no bones broken." "How ions will it be before I am well!" W returned. "If nothing happens,' she responded, ir a week or ten daya." "What could happen?" he inquired. Tever for one thing," she replied. "AL that is necessary for yon to do is te keep flu irt and not worry.' "That tiupht to be easy enough,' lie an swered; "lew people worry, do they V "Kot if they care to get well." It yon like this work?" he ventured. "Yon are Terr ia-guiait ive and presume an your hurts, was the girl's reply. "If 1 didn't like it I would not be here." 'Isn't it pretty hard for a woman to he here with, what do they esS them, emer gencies coming in night end day?" "It 1s hard and disagreeable often, the answer came, "but it is hardest on the people who are hurt and those who depend on them for support." She gave him the drops the doctor had ordered, told him brusquely to go to sleep, and presently he did an, half lulle by the stillness which seemed to fall over the nar row streets xmtside when night fell 2n the morning the little blonde nurse came on duty, and Hamilton began his daily task of trying to be cheerful. When the long, long afternoon liersn to wane, Hamilton found himself waiting eagerly for the pale-faced girl who had first welcomed him to Doubting: Castle, as he had christened the hospital. As the twilight crept in and began to darken the alley he felt an uplifting of the spirit. At the sudden flare of the street lamp, he sensed her coming, and when at last she stepped into the dingy little room, it waa as if the space had burst into blossom. Lady Disdain, he called her ia bis thoughts after the first few nights. "Yon are not getting along as well as yaa should," she warned him on the fifth even ing. "Well, that iast my fault, is it?" he in quired. T don't know positively," the nurse re plied, "but the day girl soys you are fidgetty." "1 may he a trifle uneasy in the daytime, Tout you don't have any trouble with me, do ynoT" he asked. Kt! Ton seem to be fairly reasonable." "I may turn nut to be very unreasona ble when I get well," was his answer. "Well, there will be time enough to think about thai when the time comes far yon te "X am going to take yon with me when 2 leave," he said. Her lace darkened into a frown. "Ton mustn't joke, Talr. Hamilton," she said, . coldly. "I'm not joking," he said, earnestly. "Win you ttane with me when 1 get out of this hole? Ko, I beg your pardon far finding fault, they you have all been very kind and good to me here." "Then if we have, if I have, please don't say anything like that again." "Jast as you say,' he answered. The days snd nights passed on. and what with fever, and complications, Frank Hamilton was ever six weeks in the hospital before be was entirely well. Hit conversations with the night nurse had resumed the old friend ly tone, but he had never given up his resolve la make her bis wife. The day he left he asked her to marry him, after giv ing h briefly his history. It was a hard position for the girl, and she told him that she was sorry that he really ielt serious about it. "1 an to lie married when I graduate, she told him, "and am only waiting fm that." "Is there no possibility of anything hap pen ing to change your mind?" be asked. "Sulking at all, was the reply, "bul I am sorry, Mr. Hamilton. But you will not remember it long. It seems to be nat ural sickness far men to fancy they are ia love with their nurses I don't want to be cynical, bet you wiD be happy is the way it has turned out a year from now." HamHtoa went to the yards and drew the money coming te him. Then be took a ride down to the city and made a par chase. Ertnruing to the yards, be borrowed a pen and ink and wrote a letter.
