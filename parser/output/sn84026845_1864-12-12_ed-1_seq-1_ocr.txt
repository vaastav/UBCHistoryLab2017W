He held his laotern over the tank to look in, and it instantly flamed up and destroyed the tank, together with a few barrels of oil outside. The tank was a new one and cost $50, and the loss of oil was about 100 barrels. Bio Rom ?A friend writing to us from this locality, says: "Oil, oil is all the rage io this vicinity.

C1QAH9. : DtbM in Congrtu About fyfrn?biteret i?g to our Stogy Smoking gtyulation. WABBinoToa, Doc. ?ib, 1864. Mr. Stevens, from t Committee of Ways and Means, reporte _>"?k ihe joint resolution explanatory of ?b'iAuch of the Internal Revenue act as relafM to the duty on cigars. It is ae follows\ The tax shall be assessedfon the real value, and the price for whtoh the same shall have been Bold, or alleged to have been sold or offered tor sal*, Wall only be an item of evidence to enable jbe inspector and assessor to ascet ain the true value. Tbe assessed ?alaoihiU n?*5 m?1 such alleged price" or Whenever the owner or possowor or 9 shall fix the value thereof, or-hllege a cer tain price for whiob he prattads to have purchased them or offers Mf?m for sale, it the inspector or assessor sball deem each prico below the real Trfue, be shall be at liberty to take the same-at that price I for the use of the governmetp, giving the ower or ageijt a certificate V the value, I Who shalt Re paid the ssm?'op presenting it to the Treasurer of the 0il|fcd States or I bis deputy. The returns retetive to the kinds ot cigars required by tfVnioeteenth jsssa? their cigars Inspected end stsmped, and to return and pay the same at any time before as well as at the time of sale. The stamp sball always indicate toe aotoal amount ol the tax paid or payable. Mr. Brooks, (opp.,) of N. Y., said that the Seoretary of the Treasury had recom mended that the tax be laid on the leaf, I and he now wished to know whether the Committee of Ways and Meaus intended to change the duty on tobaoeo. Mr. Stevens replied that he bad given I the subject some consideration, but did I not know what the conclusion ot the com I mittee would be. I Mr. Brooks suggested that the bill be postponed for a lew days for further con sideration. ... ? ? Mr. Stevens replied that in the opinion I of those best instructed the Department! had lost millions of dollara by the con structlone of the Commissioner of Internal I Revenue. I Mr. Brooks said that In the opinion of a large number Of manufacturers it was quite I impossible, under the principle of the law, ever to have honest mannfacturing of cl I Kara. The temptation was so great, the I duty so immense, and the punishment so severe as to render it almost impossible to prevent fraud by the measure now before them. There wss no doubt, from the brst | information, that the best way was to at tach a one cent stamp to eaoh cigar sold, and this would produoe a larger revenue than tbo principle in tbe bill. I Mr. 8teven? explained that all the com mittee bad done was to put a proper con Btrnotion on tbe law in coJtradiction to a very erroneous decision of tbe Oommis- | ?ioner of Internal Revenue. Mr. Diwes, (rep ) of Mass., eald that I gome of the manufacturers had stopped nearly entirely in ooneeqnence of this very I lingular construction of the law. The I cuiip?Mi]nn went evao beyond the law it-1 telf He thought soiotftorog ai?i? tt,ao .1 Simple joint resolution waB necessary to j remedy the defects. He hoped bis friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Slovens) would.be patient in clearing up the "smoke" whioh surrounds tbe subject. .... Mr Stephens then proceeded to show that nine tenths ot theolgars manufactured since Congress adjourned bad paid but I three dollars instead of eight dollars a thousand, owiog to the construction of ihe Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The 1 measure pending was, he repeated, to give the proper construction to the law. Mr. Brooks expressed tbe hope that the I committee would take time to oonsult with I honest manufacturers in order to remove 4 the existing difficulties, but as the Secre tary of the Treasury had reenmmended a I duty on leaf tobaoco, a doty on tobacoo should be considered in the same connec tion. He repoatei that experienced men had advised a stamp on cigars similar to the postage stamp, say one per cent. 1 and as yielding tbe largest revenue. Tbe temptation to smuggle Irom Caoad* and I elsewhere was now Irresistible. Old stamp-1 ed oigar boxes were osed in which to put 1 new olgars, add" so a stamp alone would stop this, besides realising the largest revenue. Mr. Leonard Myres (rep.) of Pa.,trusted that the' subjeet would be acted upon at once, as owing to the present oonsiruc lion the income of the government was mnch reduced from tbat soorce. Mr. Kasson, (rep.) or Iowa, advocated the passage of the pending proposition, showing that every day the government was loosing revenue by cigars paying but three instead of eight dollara a thousand. At tbe suggestion of Mr.8tevenB, further consideration of the subjeet was postpon ed ttJUMflnday. ?=. Letters l>y Vlaf ot Trues.

Barn well Bhstt introduced the following re?o lutiona ; which were ralerred to the com mittee on confederate relation*, and were ordered to be printed: Jtetolved, That South Carolina, after many conservative effort*, baviog seceded from the United Siale*, to avoid the degre datlon aod ruin of passing under the do minion of a governmsut hostile to tbe rgbts and interests of ber people, and having been forced, with ber confederates, into war, is determined, with the help of God, to BghJ it out to tbe accomplishment of a peace ot entire independence for these Confederate States. Retolvtd, That tbe sovereign states com posing tbe Confederate Slates are not amenable to the government ot the confed erate states for their existence; and that any laws paBsed by Congress conscripting their officers inte tbe army of tbe conlede rale states whereby tbe ordinary operations of tbe state governments m?j be aicjtuibei or arrested, are a .grant usurpations, to which the (states should not submit. Ruolved, Taai by tae terms of the 'oo stitutioo of tbe Confederate States, C in gress "oan make no law abridging the freedom of the press," and thereby all leg ,?l..lnn hy (1^9? the material of the press or ^ prodnciogit, by which ita freedom is abridged, is unconstitutional. Ruolved, That tbe constitution express ly prescribes that "no capital or other di rect tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census," and that "representation and direct taxes shall be apportioned among tbe states," any direct i?x*uon, therefore, which militates against these provisions. Is FUlnly unconstitutional. Revolted, That tbe insulation of African slavery is exclusively under the jartsdio tion and control ot the sovereign states, aod any law passed by Congress to eman cipate a slave in any state or to appropri ate money from the treasury of the Con federate States to boy and emancipate slaves, is unconstitutional and void.
