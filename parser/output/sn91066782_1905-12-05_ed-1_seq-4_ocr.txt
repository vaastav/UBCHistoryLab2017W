" ROOSEVELT'S REMEDY. , -A was surmised the President's an nual message deals very largely with industrial matters and quite extensively (nith that phase of it which treats of trail road rates and railroad rebates. The Agitation in this country, particularly throughout, the western states, lias turonght these matters so prominently to the surface that they cannot be ig nored. That certain shippers are suffer iifg while others are given preference is a matter of common belief now. To make this impossible should be one of tlie efforts of this session of Congress. The President has pointed out in his message the need for legislation which will make the discrimination impossible, and he has furthermore outlined his idea cf the remedy. Briefly fjtated, it is the idea of the President that Congress pass a enactment which shall create an ad ministrative body, whose province it hall be to decide, whenever cases are brought before it, whether given rates y railroad are reasonable and just, la case the rates be found unjust and unreasonable, this administrative body, after full consideration of the matter, shall prescribe the maximum limit, be , yond which the railroad shall not go in making charges, their decision to go into effect within a reasonable time. To guard against injustice tlie Presi dent's scheme provides that these de cis ions of the special administrative body tSiall be subject to review by the courts, to, whom the railroads may appeal. To Sheet another injustice, that of favoring some shipicr with a very low rate, the President would give the administrative body power to fix that rate which the railroad had given to some favored ship per as the maximum which could be eharged to all shippers. Without doubt, as the message says, only a few punish ments of this sort would be needed ip prevent the practice' of "favored ship pers." The President would not give the commission "powers to originate or initiate railroad rates but to regulate -am already establmhed. To make the decisions ot the administrative body ef fective he would have the proposed en actment of Congress contain a penalty clause, prescribing a heavy penalty for failure to live up to any rulings of the coumi.ssion.

The remedy Is to regulate the procedure by requiring the judge to give due notice to the adverse parties In-fore granting the writ, tbe hearing to be ex parte if the adverse party does not appear at the time and place ordered. What Is due notice must dcctid Umii the facts of the ease. It should not bo used us a pretext to per mit violation of law or the jeopardiz ing of life or property. Of course this would not authorize the issuing of a restraining order or Injunction In any case in wliic'j it Is not already author ized by existing law. I renew the recommendation I made in my hist annual message for an In vestigation by the department of com merce and labor of general labor condi tions, espec'jl attention to be pi; 11 to the conditions of child labor and child labor legislation In the several states. Such an In estimation should take Into account the various problems with which the question of child labor Is connected. In such a republic as ours the one thing that we cannot afford to neglect Is tbe problem of turning out decent cltizeus. The future of the na tion depend.1 npou the-citizenship of the generations to come. Tlie children of today are those who tomorrow will shape the destiny of our land, and we cannot afford to neglect them. The leg islature of Colorado has recommended that the national government provide some general measure for the protec tion from abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United States. I lay tbe matter before you for what I trust will be your favorable consider ation. A to Women Who Work. The department of commerce and la bor should also make a thorough inves tigation of the conditions of women in Industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo men are now engaged In gainful occu pations, yet there Is an almost complete dearth of data upon which to base any trustworthy conclusions a regards a subject as Important as It Is vast and complicated. Tins Introduction of wo men Into industry is working change and disturbance in the domestic and social life of the nation. The decrease In marriage, and especially in the birth rate, baa been coincident with It We must face accomplished facts, and the adjustment to factory conditions must be made, but surely it can lie made with less friction and less harmful cf- USE F, G.

It Is a social question of the first lmportane, of far greater importance than flDy merely po litical or economic question caa be. In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employee Inter ested, but also a third party the gen eral public. Every considerable labor difficulty In which interstate commerce Is involved should be Investigated by the government and the facts officially reported to the public. Iaaranee. The great insurance companies afford striking examples of corporations whose business Las extended so far beyond the Jurisdiction of the states which created them as to preclude strict enforcement of supervision and regulation by tbe parent states. In my last annual message I recommended "that the congress carefully consider whether the power of the bureau of corporations cannot constitutionally be extended to cover Interstate transac tions In Insurance." Recent events have emphasized the importance of an early and exhaustive consideration of this questIont to see whether it is not possible to furnish better safeguards than the several states have been able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind w hich has been exposed It has been only too clearly shown that certain of the men at the bead of these large corporations take but small note of the ethical distinction between honesty and dishonesty. Tbey draw tiie line only this side of what my be called law honesty, the kind of honesty necessary In order to avoid falling into the clutches of the law. Of course the only complete remedy for this condi tion must be found In an aroused pub lic conscience, a htglter sense of ethical conduct In the community at large and especially among business men and In the great profession of the hiw, and In the growtn of a spirit which condemns all dishonesty, whether la rich man or In poor man, whether It takes the shape of bribery or of blackmail. But much can be done by legislation which is not only drastic, but practical. There Is need of a far stricter and more uni form regulation of the vast insurance interests of this tommy. Tbe United Itates should in this respect follow tbe policy of other nations by providing adequate national supervision of com mercial interests which are clearly na tional lu character. I repeat my previous recommenda tion that the congress should consider whether the federal government has any power or owes any duty with re spect to domestic transactions in In surance of an interstate character. That state supervision has proved In adequate Is generally conceded. Th HfTfBBfl. There Ss more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an Ideal per fection In the methods of raising rev enue, and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend-' any serious change In these ' methods ren der such change inadvisable unless for grave reason. It Is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to de termine the moment when tbe reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such a change. No change can" be made on lines beneficial to or desired by one section or one state only. There must be something like a general agree ment among the citizens of the several states that the change Is needed and desired In the Interest of the people as a whole, and there should then be a sin cere, Intelligent and disinterested ef fort to make It In such shape as will combine, so far as possible, the maxi mum of good to the people at largo with the minimum of necessary disre gard for the special Interests of locali ties or classes, but la time of peace the revenue must, on tbe average, taking a series of years together, equal the expenditures or else the revenues must be Increased. Last year there was a deficit. Unless our expenditures can be kept within the revenues theu our revenue laws must be readjusted. It Is Impossible to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for It is as yet too early to. say whether there will be need for It It should be considered whether It Is not desirable that the tariff laws should provide for applying as against or In favor of any other nation maximum and minimum tariff rates established by the congress, so as to secure si certain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves. Economy to Expend Itarr. I earnestly recommend to the con gress the need of economy and, to thin end, of a rigid scrutiny of appropria tions. All unnecessary offices should be abolished. In the public printing also a largo saving of money can be made. There is a constantly growing tendency to publish masses of unim portant information otwhicU no human beii-.K ever looks. Vet. in spenklng of economy, I must j In nowise be understood as advocating the false economy which is In the end the worst extravagance. To cut down in the navy would be a crime against the nation. To fail to push forward all work on the Panama canal would be as great a folly. - Currency. Every consideration of prudence de mands the addition of the element of elasticity to our currency system. The evil does not consist In an inadequate volume of money, but In the rigidity of this volume, which does not respond aa it should to the varying needs of communities and of seasons. Inflation must be avoided, but some provision should be made that will Insure a larger volume of money during the fall and winter months than In the less ac tive seasons of the year, m that the currency will contract against specula tion and will expand for tbe needs of legitimate business. At present the treasury department Is at Irregularly recurring Intervals obliged In tbe Inter est of the business world that is. In the Interest of the American public j to try to avert financial crises by pro viding a remedy which should be pro- I vlded by congressional action. i Bu1mi Mrltiod In- Departments. At various times 1 have instituted in-, relitigations into the organization and conduct of tbe business of tbe execu tive departments. While none of these inquiries have yet progressed far enoogn to warrant final conclusions, they have already confirmed and era jihaftleed the general impression that the organization" of the departments la often faulty . la principle and wasteful in results, while many of their business methods are antiquated and inefficient I recommend that the congress consider this subject Federal Election. In my last annual message I said: "The power of the government to protect the Integrity of the elections of its own officials Is Inherent and has been recognized and affirmed by re peated declarations of the supreme court. There Is no enemy of free gov ernment more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption of tbe elect orate. No one defends or excuses cor ruption, and It would seem to follow that non would oppose vigorous meas ures to eradicate it I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and corruption in federal elec tions. Tbe details of such a law may be safely left to the wise discretion of the congress, but it should go as far as under tbe constitution It is possible to go and should Include severe penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe Intended to Influence his act or opinion aa an elector and provisions for the publication not only of the expend itures for nominations and elections of all candidates, but also of all contribu tions received and expenditures made by political committees." I desire to repeat this recommenda tion. All contribution .

The ittvi conference of nations held at 1 lie liu;f.te in liW. being unable to tlispose of all the business before it, recommended the consideration and settlement of a uuuiber of important questions by another conference to be called subsequently and at an early date. These questions were the follow ing: (1) The rights and duties of neu trals; (2) tbe limitation of the armed forces on land and sea and of military budgets; (.'5) the use of new types and calibers of military and naval guns; (-1) the Inviolability of private property at sea In times of war; (5) the bombard ment of ports, cities and villages by na val forces. In October, 1904, at the In stance of tbe Interparliamentary union, I Issued Invitations to all the powers signatory to The Hague convention to send - delega tes to such a conference and suggested that it be again held at Tbe Hague. From all the powers acceptance was received, coupled In some cases with the condition that we should wait until the end of the war then waging be tween Russia and Japan. The emperor of Itussia, immediately after the treaty of peace which so happily terminated this war, in a note presented to the president on 8ept 13 took the Initiative In recommending that the conference be now called. The United- States gov ernment in response expressed Its cor dial acquiescence and edited that it would as a matter of course take part In the uew conference and endeavor to further its aims. We assume that all civilized governments wlil support the movement and that the conference Is now an assured fact. This government will do everything In Its power to se cure the success of the conference to the end thnt substantial progress may be made in the cause of international peace, justice and good will. Monroe Doctrine. There are certain essential points which must never be forgotten as re gards the Monroe doctrine. In the first place, we must as a nation make it ev ident that we do not intend to treat it In any shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement ou our part at the ex pense of the republics to the south. But we must make it evident that we do not Intend to permit the Monro doe- trine to be used by any nation on this continent as a shield to protect it from the consequeuccs of Its own misdeeds against foreign nations. The Monroe doctrine does not force us to interfere to prevent tho punishment of a port save to see that the punishment does not assume the form of territorial occu pation in any shape. The case Is more difficult when It refers to a contractual obligation. This country would cer talnly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a Just debt On the other hand, it Is very inadvisable to permit any foreigu power to tako possession, even tempo rarlly, of the custom houses of an American republic in order to enforce the payment of Its obligations, for such temporary occupation might turn Into a permanent occupation. The only es cape from these alternatives may at any tlmo be that we must ourselves undertake to bring about some arrange ment by which so much as possible of a Just obligation shall be paid. To do so Insures the defaulting re public from having to pay debts of an improper character under duress, while It also Insures honest creditors of tbe republic from being passed by in the interest of dishonest or grasping cred itors. Moreover, for the United States to take such a position offers the only possible way of Insuring us against a clash with some foreign power. Tho position is therefore In tbe interest of peace as well as In the iuterest of Jus tice. , Santo Domingo. Santo Domingo has now made an ap peal to us, ami not only every principle of wisdom, but every generous lu.-thu-t within us, bids us respond to the ap peal. The coudH Sous in Santo Domingo Lave for a number of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago all society was on tbe verge of dissolution. Fortunately Just at this time a ruler sprang up in Santo Domingo who, with his colleagues, saw the dangers threat ening their country and appealed to the friendship of the only neighbor who possessed tbe power and. the will to help them. There was Imminent dan ger of foreign Intervention. . The pa tience of foreign creditors bad become exhausted, and at least two foreign na tions were on the point of intervention and were only prevented by the unoffi cial assurance of tills government that it would itself strive to help Santo Domingo in her hour of need. Accordingly, the executive depart ment of our government negotiated a treaty under which we are trying to help the Dominican people to straight en out their finances. This treaty is pending before the senate. In the meantime a temporary arrangement has been made under which the Domin ican government has appointed Amer icans to all the important positions In the customs service, and they are see ing to tbe honest collection of the rev enues, turning over 43 per cent to. the government for running expenses and putting the other 55 per cent into a safe depositary for equitable division la case tbe treaty shall be ratified among the various creditors, whether European or American. Under the course taken stability and order and all tbe benefits of peace are at last coming to Santo Domingo, dan ger of foreign Intervention has been suspended, and there Is at last a pros pect that all creditors will get Justice, no more and no less. If the arrange ment Is terminated by the failure ot ihe treaty chaos will follow, and sooner or later this government may be In volved in serious difficulties with for eign governments over tlie Island or else may be forced Itself to intervene In the Island In some unpleasant fash- Ion. - Army a4 .avy. I do not believe that any army In tbe world has a better average of enlisted man or a better type of junior officer, but the army should lie trained to act tffecttvely in a mass. Provision should be made by sufficient appropriations for maneuvers of a practical kind. Provision should be made for the pro motion of exceptionally meritorious men over the heads of their comrades and for the retirement of nil men who have reached a given age without get ting beyond a given rank. There should be an increase iu the coast artliiery force so that our coast fortifications can le lu some degree adequately manned. There is special need for an Increase and reorganization of the medical department of the army. In both the army and navy there roust lie the same thorough' training for duty In the staff corps as In the fighting line. The Importance of this vm shown con clusively In the Spanish-American and the Eusso-Jopanese wars. The work of the medical departments In the Jap anese army and navy Is especially worthy of study. Our navy must, relatively to the na vies of other nations, always l of greater size than our army. We have mo.Kt wisely continued for a number of years to build up our navy, and It has now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency. This standard must not only be maintained, but increased. It does not seem to me necessary, how ever, that the navy should, at least In the Immediate future, be increased be yond the present uunibor of units. What is now clearly necessary 'Is to substitute efficient for inefficient units as the latter Iiecome worn out or as it becomes apparent that they are use less. Probably the result would be attained by adding a single battleship to our navy each year, tlie superseded or outworn vessels being laid up or broken up as they are thus replaced. Katnrallzatloii. On this subject I recommend:' First A federal-bureau of naturali sation, to be established iu the depart ment of. commerce and labor, to su pervise the administration of the natu ralization laws and to receive returns of naturalizations pending and accom plished. Second. Uniformity of nuturalistation certificates, fees to be charged, and procedure. Third. More exacting qualifications for citizenship. Fourth. The preliminary declaration of. Intention to be abolished and no alien to be naturalized until at least ninety days after the filing of his peti tion. Fifth. -Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to bo confined to United States district courts and to such state courts as have Jurisdiction In civil actions in which the amount in controversy is un limited; in cities of over 100,000 inhab itants the United States district courts to have exclusive jurisdiction in the naturalisation of the alien residents of such cities. Criminal Lnvr. In my lasc message 1 asked tbe at tention of tho cougress to the urgent need of action to make our criminal law more effective, and I most ear nestly request that you pay heed to the report of the attorney general ou this subject There seems to be no statute of the United States which provides for the punishment of a United States attor ney or other officer of the government wbo corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrain from doing any act when the consideration for such corrupt agreement is other than one possessing money value. This ought to be remedied by appropriate legislation.
