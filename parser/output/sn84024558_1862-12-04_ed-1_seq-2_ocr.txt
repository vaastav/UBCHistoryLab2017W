UnWotft lieportir. E. O. GOODRICH, EDITOR. TOWAISTDA : Thursday Morning, December 4, 1862. A WORD TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS. The recent unprecedented rise in the price of printing paper, and other materials used in printing, has made it necessary for the pub lishers of papers to seek some means by which they can save themselves from loss and ruin. Without going into particulars, it is only nec essary to say to our subscribers that at the rate which we now pay for paper—always a cash article—the white sheet upon which the REPORTER is printed costs nearly the amount paid by the subscriber, to say nothing of the labor bestowed upon it. We observe that our neighbor of the Argjts has raised the price of bis paper to one dollar and fifty cents a year. We are loth to make auch a change, but it may become necessary. We must do this, or in some'other way save the hundreds of dollars which the increased price of paper will cost us per year. We shall first, however, try to retreuch by sendiug the REPORTER only to those who have paid for it. We have a great many subscribers, who have, through their inadvertance and our proverbial good nature, received the paper for years without paying anything. To gratify them longer is pecuniary ruin. Self preservation being the first law of nature, we shall strike from our subscription list on the first day of January, the name of every subscriber iu arrears. At the present high prica of paper, they have become too expensive a luxury for a printer to enjoy. We trust they will " see the point," aud save their own credit and ours, by paying arrears. We do not say that we shall increase the price of our paper on the Ist of January—but up to that time we will receive subscriptions at present rates. Those knowing themselves indebted are requested to settle—aud save us the mortifi cation of publishing a dim—a thing we have Dot done for years. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The Message of President LINCOLN, which we publish at length in this issue,is a concise, clear and perspicuous document. It w ill of course be read by every one able to read in this country, and by every per son in Europe and over the world, who takes an interest in the civil and military affairs of this Government and people. The view which it presents of the progress of the war for quelling the rebellion, if not as brilliant as could be wished for, is still sufficiently encouraging to stimulate hopes of speedy and decisive results. The document runs rapidly over the history of events during the year, noticing in turn, and briefly, our foreign relations —the Anglo-American Slave trade treaty —the convention with Ilanover for the abolition of the States duties—the ques tion of neutral rights—the case of the Norwegian bark Admiral P. Tordenskiola —negro colonization in Africa and else where—the new treaties with Turkey and Ilayti—our relations with various Powers iu Europe, Asia, and ou the Continent— telegraphic communication with Europe— the condition and prospects of our West ern Territories—the state of the public fi nances—the War ami Navy Department reports —the financial condition of the Post-Office Department—the affairs of the Department of the Interior—the Home stead Law—the condition of the Indians, and the Indian massacres in Minnesota— the Pacific Railroad and other internal im provements—the new Department of Agri culture and its labors ; after all of which the President recalls attention to, and dis cusses at some length, the question of what he terms " Compensated Emancipa tion," and closes the discussion and the Message by an earnest appeal on the sub ject to Congrc-ss and his fellow citizens, — adding that " The fiery trial through which we are now passing will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generations." On the 20th ult., Gen. 

BLUNT, after a forced march with his division, attacked and routed 8,000 rebels at Cane Ilill, Ark. The buttle lasted several hours, and our victory was complete. Sixty rebels were killed and a proportionate number wounded. Geo. BLUNT thinks the rebels will uot again venture north of the Boston Mountains this winter. We have advices from Newbero, N. C., to the 24th ult. From the Progress wc learn that the gunboat Ellis recently made a recou noissance iu New Topsail Inlet, within twelve miles of Wiltuingtoo, aud destroyed some very extt-usive „alt works, which were producing 500 bushels per day. t&" The Petersburg (Va.) Express says pork is held at S2O per hundred iu that city. At Lynchburg, last week, two shipping hogs-* betniii ot tobacco brought $29 per cwt. THE FSESIDEiT'S MESSiGE. FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE SENVTS AND HOUSE OF REPRSSENTATIVS : Since your last annual assembling, another year of health and boun tiful harvests has passed ; and while it has not pleased the Almighty \o bless us with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light He gives us, trusting that, ia Ifis own good time and wise way, all will be well. The correspondence touching foreign affairs which hes taken place during the last year is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request to that effect made by the House of Representatives near the close of the last session of Congress. If the condition of our relation with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly tuore satisfactory tlia 1 a nat on so unhappily distracted as re are might reason bly have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some grounds to expect that the maratime Powers, which, at the begin ning of domestic difficulties, so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think, recognize the in surgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from the position, which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own conn try. But the temporary reverses which after ward befe! the National arms/and which were exaggerated by our disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple jus tice. The civil war which has so radically chang ed for the moment the occupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily dis turbed the social conditions and aflVctcd very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing thomrhout a period of half a century It has at the same time excited political ambition and apprehensions, which have produced a profound agitation through oct the civilized world. In this unusual ng itaiion we have forebon.e taking part in any controversy between foreign States, and be tween parties or factions in such States. We have attempted no propagandism, and ac knowledged no revolution. But we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and man agement of its own affairs. Our struggle has been, of course, comtemplated by foreign na tions, with reference less to its own merits than to it 3 supposed and often exaggi rated effects, and the consequence resulting to tho.se nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this Government, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise. The treaty with Great Britain for the sup pression of tlie African Slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of spec ial pleasure to acknowledge that the exe cutor) of it on the part of Her Majesty's Gov ernment has been marked with a jealous re > spect for the authority of the United States and the right of their moral aud loyal citi zens. The Convention with Ilanover for the abo lition of the Stade dues has l)een carried into full effect under the act ot Congress for that purpose. A blockade of 3,000 miles of sea coast could not be established and vigorously enforced, in a season of great commercial ac tivity like the present, without committing oc easional mistakes, and unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their suE>jects. A civil war occurring in a country where foreign ers reside and carry on trade under treaty j stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights. Ail such colisions tend to excite misapprehensions and possibly to pioduce mutual reclamation between nations which have a common interest in pre se'ving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have,so far as possible, heard and redressed complaints which have beeu pre seated by fiiendly Powers There is, how ever, a large and augmenting number of doubt ful cases upon which the Government is una ble to agree with the Government whose pro tection is demanded by the claimants. Then are, moreover, masy cases in which the Uni ted States or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign na i tions, which the Government of those States are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign States thus interested, mutual Conventions, to examine | and adjust such complaints. Tois proposition has been made especially to Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prus-ia. In each case it has been kindly received, but lias not : yet. been formally adopted I deem it my du ty fo recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owner of the Norwegian baik Admiral P. Tordtnskiola, which vessel was,in May, 18G1, i prevented by the Commauder of lhe blockud ; irig force off Charleston ironi leaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privil ; ege had shortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have directed the Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to the proper committees. Ap plications have been made to me by many free Americans of African decent, to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as we contemplated,in recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home and abroad, some from interested motives, others upon patriotic con siderations, and sti.l others, influenced l>y philanthropic sentiments, have suggested simi lar measures ; while, on the others haud. Sev eral of the Spanish American Republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these circumstances, I have declined to move any such colony to any State, without first ob taining the consent of its Government, with an agreemeut on its part to receive and pro tect such emigrants in all their rights of free men, and I have at the same time offered to the several States situated in the tropics, of having colonies there, to negotiate with them | subject to the advice and consent of the Sen ate, to favor the voluntary emigration ol ner I sous of that class to their respective territo ries, upon conditions which shall be equal, just and humane. Liberia and Hayti are, as yet, the only countries to which colonists of Afri can descent from here could go ith certai-ity of being received and adopted as citizens, aud I regret to say that such persons contemplat ing colonization do not seem so willing to emi grate to those countries as to some others, nor as willing, as 1 think, their interest demands. I believe, however, the opinion among thsm in this respect is improving, and that ere long there will be an augmented and considerable emigration to both of these countries from the United States. The new commercial treaty Inn ween the United States and the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution, A commercial and Consular treaty has been ne gotiateb, subject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending with the Republic of Hayti. A 000- siderable improvement of the national com merce is expected to result from the measures. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Austria. The Netherlands, Italy, Rome and other European States remain un disturbed. Very favorable relations coutinue to be maintained with Turkey, Morrocco, Chi na and Japan. During the last year there has not only been no change of o: r previous rel itions with the independent States of our own continent, but more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed, are believed to be entertained by these neighbors, whose safe ty and progress are so intimately connected with our own. This statement especially ap plies to Mexico, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Hon duras, Perue and Chili. The Commission un der the Convention with the Republic of New- Granada closed its session without having au dited and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it A proposition is pend ing to receive the Convention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The Com mission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has completed its la bors, and submitted its report. I have favor ed the project for the United States with Eu rope by an Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from Sau Fran cisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the wire is being extended across the Russian Empire. The territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have remained undis turbed by the civil war, aud they are exhibit ing such evidence of prosperity as justifies our expectation that some of them w ill soou be in a condition to be organized as States, and be constitutionally admitted it.to the Federal Union The immense mineral resources of some of these territories ought to lie develop ed as rapidly as possible. Every step iu that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the Government and diminish the burdens of the people. It is worthy of your .serious consideration whether some ex traordinary measures to promote that end can not be adopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to be iff ctive is a scien tific exploration of the mineral regions in thes* territories, with a view to the publication ol results at home and iu foreign countries, re sults which cannot tail to lie auspicious. The condition of 'he finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion, have hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainly uau-iril in similar ciieumstauces, and the public credit has been fully maintain ed. The continuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made neces sary by the augmented forces now in the field, demand your best reflections, as to the best mode of providing Ihe necessary revenue with out injury to business, and with the least pos sible burdens upon labor. The suspension of specie payments by the bank-;, soon after the commencement ol your last session, made large issues ol United Slates notes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops and the satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or as well provided for. The judicious legislation of Congress securing the responsibility of these note> for loans and in ternal duties, and making them a "legal ten der for other debts, has made them universal currency, and has satbfied, partially at least, and for the time, the long-felt want of an uni- form circulating medium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and ex changes. A return to specie payments, how ! ever, at the earliest period compatible with I due regard to ail interests .should ever be kept, in view. Fluctuations in tiie value of curreu ey are always injurious, and to reduce the-e fluctuations to the lowest possible point will | always lie a leading purpose in wise legisla tion. Convertibility—prompt and certain con vertibility—into coin, is generally ackuowl edged to be the best and surest against them, and it is extremely doubtful whether a circu i l ut ion of United States Notes, payable in coin, i and sufficiently large for the wants oi the peo j pie mm be permanently, usefully and safely j maintained. Is there, then, any other mode |iu which the necessary provision for tlie pub [ li wan's can be made, and the great advan ! tages of a safe and uniform currency secured? i I know of none which promises so certain re j suits, and at the same time so unobjectiona- I lle, as the organization of Banking Assocui i tions under a general act of Congress, well I guarded in its provisions. To such associa j tions the Government might furnish circulat ing notes on the security of Tutted States ' Bonds deposited it. the Treasury. These uetes, prepared under tlie supervision of pro | per officers, being uniform iu appearance and i security, and convertible always into coin, would at once protect labor against the evils | of a vicious currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe ex< hauges. A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the ! preparation and distribution of the notes, and a general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities. The public ered it, moreover, would be greatly improved, uud the negotiations of new loans greatly facili taled by the steady market demand lor Gov eminent bonds, which the adoption of the pro posed system would create, it is an addition al recommendation ol the measure, of con siderable Weight in my judgment, that it would reconcile, as far as possible, all exist ing interests, by the opportunity offered to ex isting institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform Nation al circulation for the local and various circu lulion, secured and unsecured, now issued by them. The receipts into the Treasury from all sources, including loans and balance from the preceding year, for the fiseal year ending on June 30, 1802, were $583,885,241 00, ot which sum $40,050,391 6. were derived from Customs; $1,195,331 19 from the direct tax from public lands, $152 203 11 ; from mis cellaneons sources, $931,181 04 ; from loans in all forms, $529,092,40') 50. The remain der, $2,251,005 80, was the balance from last year. The disbursements during the same pe riod were, for Congressional, Executive and Judicial purposes, $5 939,009 29 ; for For eign intercourse, $1,339,110 35; for miscel laneous expenses, including the mints, loans, post office deficiencies, collection of revenue, and other like charges, $14,129,111 50 ; for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,- 102.985 52"} under the War Department, $393,308 401 30; under the Navy Depart inent, $42,014,569 09 ; for interest on the public debt, $13,190,324 45. and for the pay ment on tbe public debt, including reimburse inent of temporary ioan and redemptions, $96.- 090 922 09 ; making an aggregate of $510,- 841,100 25, and leaving a balance in the Treasury oq the list day of July, 1862, of I $13,043,546 81. It should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922 09, expended for re imbursements and redemption of the public debt, being included also in the loans made, may be properly deducted both from the re ceipts Bud expenditures, leaving the actual re ceipts for the year $487,788,324 97, and the expenditures $474,744,788 16. Other infor mation on the subject of the finances will be found in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statement and views I in vite your most candid and considerate atten tion. The reports of the Secretaries of the Navy and War are herewith transmitted.— These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations con ducted through these Departments. Nor could I give a summary of them here upon any prin ciple which would admit ot its being much shorter than the reports themselves. I there fore content myself with laying the reports before you, and asking your attention to them It gives me pleasure to report a decided im provement in the financial condition of the Post Office Department, as compared with several preceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year, 1861, amounted to $S 349,296 40. which embraced the revenue Iroui all the Slates of the Union for three quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessatiou of revenue from the so called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to pro duce a revenue during the same year ot SB, 298,820 90, being only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the Union dur ing the previous year. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount ex pended in 1861 was $13,606,759 11 For the last year the amount has been reduced to sll, 125,364 13, showing a decrease of about $2,- 481,000 in the expenditures, as compared with the preceding year ; about $3,750,000 as com pared with the fiscal year 1860. The deficien cy in the Department for the previous year was $4,551,966 98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814 57. These fa vorable results are in part owing to the cessa tion of tuail service in the insurrectionary States, and in part to a casual review of all expenditures in that Department, in the in terest of economy. The efficiency of the Pos tal service, it is be'ieved, has also been much improved. The Postmaster General also open ed a correspondence through tiie Department of Stale with foreign Governments, promising a Convention of Postal representatives, for ' the purpo.-c of simplifying the rates of foreign i postage, and to expedite the foreign mails I litis proposition, equally important to oar | adopted citizens and to the commercial inter | ests of this country, lias been favorably enter tained and agreed to by all the Governments from whom replies have been received. I ask | the attention of Congress to the suggestions j of the Postmaster General in his report ics | peeling the further legislation required, in his i opinion, for the benefit of the postal service | The Secretary of the Interior reports as 10l ; lows in regard to the public lands : "The pub lie lands have ceased to be a source of reve ; uue. From Ist July, 1861, to 3Uth Septem j ber, 1862, the entire cash receipts from the | sale ot lands were $137,476 26, a sum much ! less than the expense of our land system dur ing the same period. The Homestead Law, which will take effect on the Ist of Jauuary ; next, offers such inducements to settlers that | sales lor cash cannot be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the expenses of the general land office, and the cost of suAmying aud | bringing the land into market. The discrep j ancy between the sum here stated as arising j from the sales of the public lands, and the same derived from the same source as report ed from the Treasury Department, arises, as i ; understand, from the fact that the periods ol I time, though apparently, were not really coin I cidetit at the beginning point. The Treasury | Report including a considerable sum now, which had previously been reported from the Interior, sufficiently iarge to greatly overreach I the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by the Interior, and not by the | Treasury. The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, j during the pa>t year, manifested a spirit ol I insubordination, and at several points have en j gaged is open hostilities against the white set , tlenients in their vicinity. The tribes occupy i ing the Indian country south of Kansas, re i nounced their allegiance to the United State s. and entered into treaties with the insurgents! Those who remained loyal to the States were | driven troin the country. The Chief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the pur poie of restoring the former relations of the i tribe with the United States. He alleges that they were constrained by superior force to en ter into treaties with the insurgents, and that the United States neglected to f'uinish the protection which thtir treaty stipulations re quired. In the month of August last, the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked the set | tlements in their vicinity with extreme feroci i ty, killing indiscriminately men, woman and i cliildien. This attack was wholly unexpect \ ed, and therefore no means of defence bad | been provided. Jt is estimated that not less than eight hundred persons were killed by the Indians, and a large amount of property wa I destroyed. How this outbreak was induced . is not definitely known, ant' suspicions, which | may be unjust, need not to be stated. Infor ; matiou was received by the Indian Bureau from different sources about the time hostili ; ties were commenced, that a simultaneous at tack was to be made upon the white settle ments by all the tribes between the Mis-ussip pi River and the Rocky Mouutuins. The Stale of Minnesota has suffered great injury from this Indian war. A laige portion of her ter ritory has been depopulated and a seveie loss lias been sustained oy the destruction of pro perty. The people of that State manifest much anxiety for the removal ot the tribes beyond the limits of tbe State, as a guarantee against, future hostilities. The Commissioner ot Indian Affairs will furnish full details. 1 submit lor your especial consideration whether our ludiau system shall uot be remodeled.— Many wise and good men have been impressed with the belief that this cau be profitably 1 done. I submit a statement of the proceedings of the Commissioners, which shows the progress that has been made in the enterprise ot coo structiug the Pacific Railroad, una this sug gests the earliest completion of the roa and also the favorable action of Congress upon the projects uow pending before them tor en larging the capacities of the great canals in New-York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, and especially to the vast interior re giou hereinafter to be notictd at some greater length. I purpose having prepared and laid before you, at an early day, some interesting aud valuable statistical iulorwation upon the subject. The military and commercial impor tance of enlarging the Illinois arid IVlicliigan Canal, and improving the Illinois River, is presented in the report af Col. Webster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress I respectfully ask attention to it. To carry out the provisions of the Act of Congress of the 15ih of May last, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States to be organized. The Commis sioner informs me that within the period of a few months this Department has established |an extensive correspondence and exchanges, I both at heme and abroad, which promise to ' effect highly beneficial results in the develop j ment of a correct knowledge of recent iui provements in Agriculture, in the introduction j of new products, and in the collection of the agricultural statistics of the different States ; j also, that it will soon be prepared to (listrib ; ute largely, seeds, cereal, p ants and cuttings, | and has already published and liberally (1 ffns ied much valuable information, in anticipation ;of a more elaborate report, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable | test- in chemical science, now i i progress in the laboratory The creation of this Depart ment was for the more immediate benefit, of a large class of our most valuable citizens, and I tru.-t the liberal basis upon which it has been \ organized, will not only meet your approba (ion, but that it will realize at no distant day, all the fondest anticipations of its ruot san guine friends, and become the fruitful source of advantage to ali our people. On the 221 day of September last, a pro clamation was is-u <1 by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith submitted In accord ance with the purpose expre-sed in the second paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully ; recall your attention to what may lie called j " Compensated Emancipation." A nation may lie said to consist of its territory, its people, : and its laws The territory is the only part ' which is of certain durability. One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh, hut the Eirth abidcth forevi r ! It is of the tir>l import!nee to duty, to consider and esti mate this ever enduring part. That portion of the earth's surface which is owned and in habited by the people of the United States is ; well adapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not well adapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of cli mate and productions are of advantage in ttiis age for one people, whatevi r tli-y might have been in former ages. Steam and telegraph, in intelligence, have brought these to lie an ad vantageous combination for one united people. In the Inaugural Address f briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a rem edy for the difference between the people of the two sections. I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat : " One section of our country be lieves .slavery is right, and ought to lie extend ed, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended. This is the only sub stantial dispute. The Fugitive Slave e! .se of the Constitution and the law for the sup pression of the African Slave trade, are each i as well enfoiced, perhaps, as any law can ever : be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. I The great body of the people abide bv the dry legal obligation in both eases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be per fectly cured, and it would be worse in both leases, after the separation of the sections, than before. The foreign Slave trade, now imper fectly snpprcsftd, would be ultimately revived | without restriction in one section, while fugi tive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the otlu r. Physically speaking, we cannot separate ; we ; cannot remove our respective sections fr in | each other, nor build an impassable wail be tweeu them A husband and wife may be di voreed, ar.d go out of the presence, ami be yotid tlie reach of each other, but :he diff r>-ut par s if our country cannot do this They j cannot but. remain face to face, and inter course, either amicable or hos'ile, must con tinue between them. Is it possible, then, to | make that intercourse more advantageous or ; more satisfactouy after separation than hi fore? ; Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws ? Can treaties be more faith ! fully enforced between aliens than laws can among frietuE ? Suppose you go to war—you ; cannot fight always ; and when, after miieli loss cn both .-ides, f.nd no gain cri eider, you I cease fighting, the identical oM questions as to j terms of intercourse are again upon von " There is no lint', straight or crooked, sui'a j hie tor a national boundary upon which to di vide. Trace through from ea<t to west upon | the line between the free and slave country | and we shall (ind a little more than one furl ! ot its length are rivers easy to lie crossed, and : populated, or soon to be populated, fhirkly j upon both sid'S, while nearly all its remaining; length are mm ly surveyor's lues over which I people may walk buck at d forth without HUV j consciousness of their presence. No part of | this line can be made any mored til nit to pass i by wrting it down on paper or parchment as I a national boundary. The fact of separation, [ if it comes, give-; upon the part of the seced ; ing section, the Fugitive Slave clause, along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from, while I should ex pect no treaty stipulations would ever be made to take its place. But there is another difficulty. The great interior, bounded east by the Alleghanies north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the line along which the culture o, cor., and cotton meets, and which includes part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wiscon sin, Missouri, Kansas, lowa, Minnesota, and the territories of Dacotuh, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, has above ten millions of people, and will have fifty millions within fifty years, if not prevented by any political folly "or mis' take. It contains more than one third of the country owned by the United States, certain !y more than one million of square miles, once half us populous as Massachusetts already h, it w. uld huvi more than seventy five millions of people. A glance at the map shows, that territorially speaking, it is the great body of the Republic. The other parts are but mar ginal borders to it—the magnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Mountains to\he Pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources in the production of provisions, grains, grasses and all of which proceed from them, this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world. Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has not yet been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the pr spect presented ; and yet this region has no sea coast—touches no ocean auywbere. As part "of one nation its people now find, and mav forever fi !ir ] t way to Europe by New Vork. to South'A T'' ica and Africa by New Orleans, and to A'" by San Francisco. But separate our com & country into two nations, as designed | )y a present rebellion, and every man of this c '! interior region is thereby cut off from ' one more of these outlets, not perhaps i, physical barrier, but by embarrassing ai) ,j' 4 roueous trade regulations. And this i s wherever a dividing or boundary |in e qj!,/? 6 fixed. Place it between the now f, te ' slave country, or place it south of Kentur-l or north of Ohio, and still the truth that none sou h of it can trade to any nr,-t ' place north of it, and none north of j; trade to any port or place south of it upon terms dicated by a government'forei^ to them These outlets East, West and Sr. are indispensable to the well being of u people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast i ' rior region. Which of the three may be"* best is no proper question All are better than either, and all of right belot." to r people and their successors, forever* T u themselves, tiny will not a-k where a |i„ e 'l separation shall he, but will vow, rather the there shall be no such line. Nor are the* tDir gin 11 regions les interested in these communi catious to and through them to the great on'. >nle wort . They, too, and eaeh f t":,etn have ,c <-.-S to tills EgVot of the West, w j t l .mi paving roll at the crossing of any national boundary. Our national strife spriics n,/' from our permanent part, not Iron; the Un| we inhabit, not from our national horn. stead Tnere is no possible st v ring of ibis but WntO multiply, and not mitigate evils amongst u in all its adaptions and attributes it d-mands union, and abhors sepiratiou.
