Washington, Dec. 5. The democratic senate, caucus this afternoon authoriz ed ChairmanJSorman to appoint a com mittee of nine to assign the democratic members to the committeeships. The drift of the discussion, and especially thie remarks of Senators Vest and Blackburn, indicated a willingness to permit the republicans to assume the responsibility of the committee, andjj through that channel, of the legislation of the present congress. It is under stood that no protest will tie entered against the proposition of the republi cans to take full control of the com mittees, including chairmanships. The following six members of the old com mittee were continued by Mr. Gorman: Messrs. Coekrell, Harris, Blackburn, Brice, Jones and Gorman. The three additional men will hot be selected be fore Monday. , . The caucus also decided that when ever th.e. republicans should put for ward a candidate for president pro tem pore Senator Harris should be placed in nomination as the democratic candi date.

The Death of Jim Knle, Once the Super intendent of the CoinKtncfc. From the San Francisco Examiner. Jim Rule, known wherever there is a miner on the Pacific slope, is dead. Rule came to the; coast in the early days with a number pf Cornish miners. Like many others his- experience was with the pick and shovel. : He drifted into Brown valley .and began working the famous Pennsylvania 'and Keystone mines. There he began developing those talents for underground mining that afterward brought him fame and welth. ' Water on the lower levels forced the owner to abandon the Brown valley levels, and Rule went.across the mountains to the Comstock lode, of which he had 'heard so much, , At first he worked with pick and shovel till some astute "mine boss" per ceived Chat the man had talents for bet ter things. ; !He Rapidly passed from "shift boss" to foreman and then to superintendent. 'One of the first mines 'he directed was rtbe Lady Bryan, owned by his brother, John Rule, and William O'Neil. When the Lady Bryan was laid to rest in the graveyard of "wild cats" Rule found employment with Sen ator John P. Jones. Jones owned a lot of mills on the Corn-stock.-: The mines off ering them We were rapidly gding to wreck. Jones saw an end to his profit able milling unless he could stir up business. He conceived a way out of the trouble in leasing the mines and paying the directors 50 cents a ton for all theore he took out. In arranging for this work Jones employed Rule as unaergrouna superintendent. It was was while engaged in this work that Rule acquired "his extensive knowledge of the intricate lower levels of the Com stock lode. There, too, he gained pos session of information that he used afterward to his advantage.1"--. ' under tne contract he uncovered, a number of ore bodies. Jones made a barrel of money, and mining stock shares -recovered " and begu n " to jump about almost as lively as in the great days of the 70's. Jones and Rule parted in anger. Rule claimed that he had not been fairly treated. Just before he quit he got an Inkling that there w'as a body of valu able ore in the mine, and went away without saying anything about it. About a year later Jones gave up his contract, el'aiming that he had not made anything out of it. In the 80's the Comstock mines were again paralyzed for want of ore "finds, Consolidated Virginia was selling for 25 cents a share, with a twenty-cent as sessment paid. While the market was to this condition Rule made a proposi tion to develop a body of ore in the Gould & Curry mine for a share' in the proceeds. He was given the chance,: but it transpired that his body of ore was not in the Gould & Curry, but in the Savage mine, just over the bound ary line. The find was enough for the most disgruntled operators, however, and stocks began- to jump. After that Rule turned his attention to gold mining. He Was very successful with the Hurley mine, in Calaveras county, a claim that had long been worked unprofitably. He remained there off and on until the fall of 1893, when the lifelessness of Comstock min ing shares again attracted his atten tion. He began to talk of a body of ore that he knew of in the Consolidated Virginia mine; he went into the details of his row with Jones and the reasons why he had never mentioned the dis covery before. After several confer ences the directors agreed to pay him $4,000 a month for six months and ten per cent on the value of all the ore he discovered. The bonus, however, was not to exceed $10,000 no matter how large any one body of ore discovered should be. Jim Rule went to work with the eyes of thousands of stock "shippers" and speculators on him. The market took an upward heave on the report that Jim Rule had gone up .to A'irginia City under contract to Cud another bonanza. But somehow the "discovery" had disappeared. Th six months waned painfully by and Rule could not find ore averaging better than $20 a ton. Some people said that Roger Prender East, the superintendent who succeeded him with Jones, tod been over th ground and picked out all 'the payrock. Anyhow, the directors and everybody except Jim Rule gave up the job as hopeless. Jim begged for two months' mor time, but the managers refused to give him another chance. Rulo never got over the keen disap pointment of his failure. It always ran kled with him whenever 'th Comstock mines were mentlond. From that time on he Was not so cheery and hopeful, and his spells of not feeling quite well became more frequent. He returned to the Lone Star mine at West Point, and with his partner, Captain Hurley, do voted all his attention to trying to trying to find "pay dirt" on his own ground. TUE 

LATEST FliOX THE riXCAlttX. Contented and 1 airly Happy, but No Quite So Prosperous us Once. From the San Franolso t Bulletin. Fourteen thousand miles of southern seas has the missionary brjg Pltcairn, with a large party of Oaklanders on board, traveled since she dropped down the stream on the first of May last and spread canvas for Pltcairn Island, with supplies and good books for the survi vors of the'mutlneers of the Bounty. Captain J. E. Graham, who commands the Pltcairn, writes to this city an in teresting letter of the vessel's cruise, and mentioned that the pretty little craft is on her homeward trip. When the Pltcairn sailed from San Francisco in the interests of the Sev- enth-dav Adventlst society of this coast she cleared direct for the queer little settlement of historic fame. She took as passengers Dr. and Mrs. Brancht, Miss McCoy, a Mr. Owen and his son, and Missionaries Young, Gra ham, Eldon, and Mr. and Mrs. Elahas- man, all of Oakland. She proceeded direct to the Island, arriving on the 6th of June, and none too soon, for. provi sions were running low at the settle ment, and, although fruit was plentiful and there was little fear of actual star vatioit, the "touch or civilization" nas tempered the appetites of the Pltcairn- ers, and they often long lor canned goods and pie. ' i The island Is not so prosperous . col ony as it used to be is the information that came in the same mail with Cap tain Graham's letter. Too frequent in termarrlagei has somewhat weakened the constitutions of the inhabitants, and there is frequent complaint of sick ness. The colony has not increased to any extent in numbers, but the people are contented and happy for all this. A school has been established at the Island, and competent teachers are em ployed. The children of the colonists are by no means lacKing .in dook knowledge, for it is reported that In addition to their regular studies of reading, writing and arithmetic, the Pltcairn youngsters absorb much of Shakespeare, Ma-cauley and Carlyle. They study the world at large through the medium of good authors. The brig stopped one week at Pit cairn; she then left for the Society Is lands, for the Oakland missionaries were bent on spreading Gospel truths among the indolent worshippers of Anu. A pretty thorough canvass for stray souls was made and visits paid to the numerous Seventh-day Adventlst stations throughout the group. The brig called at Austral, Nine and Cook's islands, and at the latter .found the natives and missionaries alike suf fering from ennui, for, according to one energetic white man, no effort had been made by the Cookites to capture traders or fill their stomachs with any thing but the blessings of nature In the shape of fruits. The Piteairn drifted toward Tonga, was held by calms, and finally made that port. From there she sailed for Suva, and took in Copra. From Suva the brig will sail to the Gilberts, thence to Honolulu, thence to San Francisco, and then for a season she will rest her corralled bilge planks on the mud flats of modern Athens.- " The kind Boss makes his Biscuits with t CO BOSS 5 OH X - .: 1 ' " 1 1 u -'HW BOSS BAKING POWDER 4.

The Post in an article commenting on President Cleveland's message' to the American congress re marks that Germany has less to lose by an economic war than have the United States. In view of the fact that if the present threats made by America should be successful the Americans would be certain to use a similar screw unceasingly, Germany must resist Pres ident Cleveland's warning.

There were heavy liquidations in certain of the in dustrials, notably Leather preferred and Tobacco, and moderate selling in Louisville and Nashville, Chesapeake and Ohio, St. Paul and Denver and Rio Grande preferred for Losdon account. The sales for foreign account were es timated at from 12,000 to 15,000 shares, and were attributed to a belief that con gress will not take up the currency matters at once sb expected. An ad vance in sterling exchange here and the certainty of gold "exports by Sat urday's steamers add to the' bearish feeling. It is thought that at least one and perhaps three millions will be for warded on the day named. The usually active raiiway issues ran off to 1 per cent.j the decline be ing most, pronounced in Manhattan, Louisville and Nashville, Chesapeake and Ohio, Denver and Rio Grande pre ferred and Missouri Pacific. lThe grang ers lost about H per cent., but when the dividend of 2 per cent, was de clared on Northwest common, which practically places the Stock on a 5 per cent. toaEls, Northwest rose to 106, and the other western shares ral lied fractionally. On the industrials Sugar, as usual, was the special card, 64,000 shares changing hands at 103 105. The suit brought by Syracuse parties had not the slightest effect on the stock; in fact, short sellers of yes terday and the day before were badly punished and were forced to cover dur ing the first hour when the stock touch ed 105. When the usuaf dividends were an nounced the prices settled back to 103. One broker bought 15,000 shares sup posed to be for a prominent operator. Tobacco and Leather preferred were depressed under free offerings of stock for the long and short account. The former dropped 3 to76'4 and the latter 1' to 6294. Chicago Gas again ruled quiet and firm at 6465. Pacific Mall after an early decline to 316, returned to S2 and left iff at 32 bid. Up to the close of busiiiess mo announcement had been made of the signing of the agreement with the Panama. , In the last hour of business Read ing was more active, and on buying by brokers identified with interests op posed to the Earl-Olcott commltte, the stock rose about a point to 10. A ru- more wnicn lacked conflrmatiom was to the effect that the assessments on the junior securities will be cut down 20 per cent, on the stock. Philadelphia advices stated that the company had retired half a million car trusts from earnings. Speculation closed irregular. Net changes ehow declines of 41 per cent. Tobacco, however, dropped SVt per cent. $ Leather preferred, 1 per cent.; Chicago Gats Reading and "West ern Union gained 9s per cent. Bonds i were lower. iSales were $1,- 366,000.
