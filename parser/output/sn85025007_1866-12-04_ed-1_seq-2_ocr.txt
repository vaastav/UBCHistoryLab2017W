Alexandria! TUESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 4. We had the pleasure, yesterday alternoou, r> L 1 _..VL ,5.. T> 01 presenting our suDscnuers whu iuu iiesident's Message, and an abstract of all the Reports oh the different departments, in an extra sheet, prepared at the office of the National Intelligencer, together with a summary of all the latest news foreign and domestic. The additional expense incurred, by this, was more than compensated by the satisfaction afforded I to our readers, and by the coming back again, in some degree, to the "old times/' when the Gazette, with its expresses, and other arutngcments, always issued the "Message" soon 5 after it appeared in Washington. We have received some of the advanced sheets of a work shortly to be published by the National Publishing Company,Richmond, Ya., "Alexander H. Stephens, in Public and Private, with his letters and speeches;" and from these specimens are inclined to think favorably of the forthcoming book. Mr. Stephens is one of the ablest men that Georgia can boast of, in modern times, and his character is deserving of respect and admiration. Like Henry Clay, he was a poor boy, and by the aid of his own talents and the fostering carc of his friends in the South, made himself a name and fame recognized all over the country. The letters and speeches now to be collected anu published have all passed under the review of Mr. Stephens himself The biography is written by Henry Cleveland, esq., an intimate fiiend of Mr. S., and well qualified for the task he has under taken. The National Intelligencer says: "If Con gress does not resort to extreme measures it will not be for want oi urging from the socalled loyalists of the South. Naturally enough these gentlemen, finding themselves in a hope less minority, unless aided by negro votes, are intent on securing themselves by any means possible. By disfranchising''rebels''and enfranchising black men they hope to perpetuate their power and personal consequence, and rule a population which despises them, not for their Unionism, but for their meanness and bitterness.'' The name of Gen. Piobert E. Lee, is mentioned in connection with the office of Governor of Virginia. We would prefer him for that station to any man in Virginia, because he is honest and capable, and worthy of any honor that a grateful people can bestow upon him? and because he would recommend only measures that look to the peace and harmony of the country. But Gen. Lee could not be a candidate, if he would? and what is more "would not. if he could !" Thau. Stevens is to bring forward biiis curtailing the President's power, in removals from office, limiting his patronage, &e. Wait till the .Radicals get a President of their own stamp, and they'll give him more patronage and more power than he had had before. The design of Stevens is to prevent the President from having his own friends in office, or removing his political opponents, and to subject him, in all these matters, to the control of the dominant parry in the Senate. A Yicksburg paper publishes a statement of a contract recently made by Joseph E. Davis brother of Jefferson D-jvis, by which he leases to R. T. Montgomery, a negro, and an association of colored people, lor a term of years, his plantations, which have just been restored to him by the Government. What an answer this is to the Radical calumny that the landholders of the South are unwilling to afford to the colored race a chance of living. The President's Message is much approved of, and praised by the Conservative press of the country. While objection is justly made io some of the propositions of the President,? for instance, that" Congress has the right to exclude members on account of what it regards as heterodox political opinions, or because of nets done in obedience to the laws of their several States?the general tone and temper of the Message are worth}' of ail the commendation that has been bestowed. ? ?capp The Louisville Journal, the Boston Post, the Alexandria Gazette, and only one or two other papers in the whole country, have the same editors now that they had thirty years ago.-These, then, are "established institutions." The National Intelligencer says: "We are under no apprehensions about Congress territorializing the South." Nevertheless matters seem to tend that way very strongly. The Radical Judges of the recr-nt election in Baltimore have sent in to the House of Representatives, a paper denying that Pit dps and Archer were h.nallu elected to Congress. l7 * ''Beau Hickman is a native of North Carolina." This is published in tlie newspapers as the correction of a statement that he was bom in Virginia. The telegraphic reports ol the flour, grain, cattle, and grocery markets, in the Northern cities are, that no material change has occurred this week. The report of the Secretary of the Trearury is regarded as likely to have an extremely favorable effect on the public credit. The Supreme Court c*t the U. S. and the U. S. Court of Claims, have both commenced their sessions in' Vvrashington. 1 A captain of a canal boat, was killed on | Sunday last, in Richmond, by a negro man. Bishop "W hitting ham of Md., has returned from his late visit to Europe. 

ALEXAS 1EE KADICAL "WELCOME." The republican members of Congress were yesterday received at the'Capitol. A procession .was formed about noon and marched through Pennsylvania avenue aud several streets, arriving at the eastern portico of the CapitoT between two and three o'clock, where those composing the demonstration closed in a solid mass. The procession consisted of Loyal Leagues, Ifadical Associations, the colored sol uicrs and sailors league, two companies of colored troops, deputations from Baltimore and Alexandria, &c. There were about 3,000 persons in the procession. and nerhnns half that number in arldi tinn at the Capitol, making an auditory of some 5.000 persons. At least one-half of those in the procession were colored. There was music from both white and colored bands, and banners and emblems were displayed, and much enthusiasm was manifested. Judge Cartter, of the Supreme Court of Washington, delivered the address of welcome, in which he praised Congress next to the country's brave defenders for saving the country. Mr. Speaker Oullax responded in a long address tin behalf of the Bouse of Representatives. The tone of the speech was bitter against the South for rejecting the constitutional amendment. Senator Yates, of 111., responded oh behalf the Sena-c. He was very enthusiastic over the the late election, and referred to the 2d and 12th chapters of the Epistle to the Ephesians for the epitaph of the democratic party. Being requested to quote the chapters, he respectfully begged to be excused, much to the amusement of every one around. Being pressed still further, and offered a Bible, he said: Well, if you iusist upon it, I believe it is something in this style: "Ye are without Christ, being aliens to the Commonwealth of Israel. [Laughter. 1 Without the covenant I promise, having no hope and without God in the world." [Laughter and applause.] Mr. Yates was very emphatic in his opposi tion to Southern admission, declaring that those States should never come in until every American should have the privilege of going to any part of this country and enjoying its privileges. Hon. Win. I). Kelly, of Pennsylvania, was called for and spoke some time, and the crowd soon after dispersed. The welcoming banquet took place in the temporary Fair Building, corner Seventh street and Pennsylvania avenue. At the five tables were seated ladies and gentlemen to the number of 400. General Hiram Walbridge, of New York, did the lienors as president of the feast. Hesaid the appeal which a recreant President had made had been met with a stern rebuke ou the part of the people, and it would become the duty of Congress soon to put into the national legislation the moans of bringing the Southern States into obedience and subordination. If the Executive should resist, it would become the duty of Congress to remove him from office. [Cheers.J It the Southern States should continue to set themselves up against Congress, it would be its duty to appeal to the people oi hose Siates without regard to color. Thad. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, responded, lie attacked the President with vigor, declaring that having been elevated into power through an unexpected event visited upon the nation for its sins, he now wished to be king instead of President. [Hisses.] 31 r. Stevens said the war was not over. Its main ani final object was pursued by the enemy with relentless energy. The object had at first been to ru'c over at least halt' the country as a nation of slaves, to in-reduce free trade and to humiliate the North for its persistent advocacy of freedmen. The object now was to rule-1lie whole nation, by means of an oligarchy, making negroes and copperheads contribute to the increased power ot the South through the increase of the number of its votes ,t.o seize the reins of government, to introduce free trade, and to break down the tree people of the North. During the war Jeff Davis was commander-in-chief of the llebel army, with Lee as his chief adviser. Now, Andrew Johnson was their commander-in-chief, and poor old w nr.1 Troa friniv r.limP ninr^liol 'ifliiK'ni' onrl tnv I T V Ji If Ci^ til VII

[Laugh ter ] Tho people were to ch clde new whether they were to have Andrew Johnson as President or as King, for they were told they had no other choice left. [Laughter, j He wanted the encouragement of the soldiers. The enemy had the vantage ground, having possession of the White House, and was dispensing with a corrupt hand the vast patronage of the nation, and yet lie had no fears. The array consisted of citizens as well as soldiers. It had a few mercenary officers like the Stcedmans, the Pixes, and the Wools; but if 1 he government wore to order Grant, or Howard, or Farragut to do its tretclu rous work they wrathl break their swords rather than obey. With Sheridan for a leader, and 25 or 50,000 colored soldiers, they might defy Andrew J.-hnson and all who might lullow his had. But if the time should ever come when the conspirators would muster audacity equal to their ambition, and, as once happened i'i England, attempt to turn 1 the regular army against the people, Congress would not have to rely on the Southern freedtnen alone. The men of the loyal North would spring to their feet and unsheathe their weapons. as when they heard the first booming cannon of Sumter. Let Congress be bold, and the soldiers of tho last war would take care of the next, and the usurper who leads the hostile forces would have time and leisure to revise his boasted proclamation in one of the embrasures of Fortress Monroe. |Cheers.] The usurper's head wraid rest much more cjuietiy, to bo sure, on a lap-board and goose than when oppressed with a crown. [Laughter.] With less than impartial suffrage the South, with his consent, should never be reconstructed. He would not be content with such a peurile work as universal amnesty and universal suffrage. Senators Howe and Wilson and Mr. Forney also spoke, and the bamjuet did not end till nearly 12 o'clock. ? I wigjum Congress.?congress rcasscmbleu yesterday at noon, and in each house a quorum was present. Committees were appointed to wait on the President, and soon .niter his annual message was received and read. In the Senate an effort was made to take ap the bill to grant colored suffrage in the District of Columbia, but it failed on a point of order. Bills were introduced to punish the illegal appointmenfc of officers of the United States, to regulate the tenure of offices, and to provide for the election of a public printer by the concurrent vote of the two houses. The House passed a bill to repeal the 13ill section of the act of July 17, 1S62, to suppress insurrection, and to punish treason, designed to take from the President the granting of amnesty and pardon by a vote of 111 to 39 A number of bills and resolutions were introduced and referred, among them a bill to convene the next Congress at noon on the forth of March next; a bill requiring the concurrence of the Senate in all appointments to office; a bill creating the Department of Internal Revenue; a bill to regulate removals from office ; a bill authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to seli at public auction in the city of JSew York two millions of gold on Monday of each week, on certain conditions. ^ These bills, with others which were introduced, were severally referred. The committee of ways and means was instructed to inquire into the expediency of so changing the revenue laws as to dispense with inspectors of distilleries. gold. New York, December I,?Gold, 140$. 

DRJA GAZETTE AND Virginia?Message oi Governor Peirpoint. Richmond, December 3.?This was the day for the regular meeting of the Legislature. The members generally assembled, but no quorum appearing in the Senate, both Houses adjourned until to-morrow. The following is an abstract of the Message of Governor Peirpoint "After referring to causes for congratulation and thanksgiving, the Governor says that all the agencies provided for the enforcement of the laws are in successful operation, and no serious disturbance of the public peace had occurred. The financial operations for the last year are transmitted, as well as the report of the Treasurer. Taking in the income ol last yearns abasia of estimate, there would be received for the year ending September, 1SC7,the sum of SI,228,079 30, adding to which the amount on hand Ootoeer 1st, I860, there would be $1,563,280.80. He estimated the expenses to October 1st, 18G7, at $510,000, which would 1 r\ .. K.>Ui-nn 1 fVV-?

An assessment on real and personal property of about 46 cents on the 100 dollars, making altogether GO cents on the 100 dollars, would be reouired for necessary expenses. xhere has been some talk of repudiating or scaling the public debt. No step could be so prejudicial to all future interests as the serious discussion of that subject, destroying the outside credit of the State, and preventing the influx of capital. Should such a step be taken no gentleman would be anxious therealter to be recognized abroad as a Virginian.? They might hope for a better harvest this year than last, which would banish the idea of 1 repudiation. West Virginia was to pay by the terms of the division her fair share of the debt. To wait until the Commissioners should settle the matter would be good policy. The Governor recommended the .sale by the i State of the stock iu the James liiver Canal, turnpikes, and bridges, and in railroads not completed. Also that a reform should be effected in the oyster laws. Criminal expenses were largely increasing, lie pointed out in detail how to diminish them and how the administration of justice could be facilitated. It was to be regretted that the State could not contribute more liberally to education. To make the freedman a useful member of society he should fcc educated. lie was gratified to say iliac sums of money had been raised in the North for this purpose, and that schools were in successful operation. The * 11 i i . v 1 colored man laoorea unaer greacuisauvnncages. When he had as many inducements to work as the white man, doubtless he would work, arid he was pleased to find that man}' of the best men seemed disposed to give hirn a fair chance, it was very desirable however to induce foreign emigration. lie further recommended them to correct existing abuses in the management of railroad companies, so as to reduce the rates . to the lowest remunerative standard. The Secretary of State of the U. S. had for' warded to him a joint resolution of Congress proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which he submitted to them. The President had disapproved of it and insisted on the immediate admission of loyal Representatives duly elected. Some controversy had taken place as to what the i President meant by loyal, some claiming that it was those who could take the prescribed oath. The elections had however resulted in a dei cisive majority in favor of the Congressional i view. An effort was making to induce the Legislatures in some States to reject the Constitutional Amendment, hoping to be more successful in a future contest, but he thought it very unlikely that such would be the result. The people of the South should not be again beguiled by professed friends at the North.? The late elections showed that Congress was supported by a large majority of the people. He thought there were no hopes of better terms. No political status bad }et been given to those who had been in arms against the Government. Congress had denied the assumed right of the President to settle that status. IN o disgrace could be incurred by accepting the proposed terms; they were not nearly so hard as might be anticipated. Per son and property weie sacred, and the right of suffrage was lift to them?should they not accept the amendment the result was uncertain. fie left the whole subject with them, invoking the Divine blessing on their deliberations."

TEST FR OM EUR OFF. . BY THE ATLANTIC CABLE. Our advices by the cable from Europe are to yesterday. The news is not important.? Two regiments of troops were to embark at Liverpool yesterday for Ireland. Count Bismarck had returned to Berlin. A great reform meeting had been held at Edinburgh, at which about eighty thousand persons were present. At Paris the Mexican bond-holders were in great tribulation. Extensive preparations were being made in Spain to nut down any revolutionary movement that might occur. _______ The Washington Chronicle is delighted witli the "opening scenes" in the House of Representatives, especially with the instant pas-age of the hill, "taking away from the President the power to grant pardons and amnesty to rebels!!! We hope that as 11 had begins," we wii! not have it to say, that "worse remains behind."
