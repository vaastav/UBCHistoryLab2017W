The Detroit marine reporter, Captain Hi.i., rrpiirta the number of deaths of seamen during tho present year to be two hundred and seventy tiro. Of these f.Tenty-tliree died from naluial C.iuaas,?l4 were drowned, threa were murdered, is commuted suiciJe, and 20 vera accidentally killed.

The Boston AJeerliter la reviewing Th.ton's life of Mrs. Woodiitli. bits T. T., after the fol lowing- fashinnt " If Mr. Tilton has Inrentod tbe etory, his loiagiation surpasses that of Mun chauaen ; If be believes it. his credulity ei- eludes him from tbe list of credible witnesses. Mrs. Woedhull herself, if not the basest of hum bugs, Is to be profoundly pitied far her misfor. lines, her delusion, her ambitions, and barbing' rnpher." . Tha Philadelphia Pre- Is nt atallploased that Judge Ksm.fv, of Pennsylvania, was noj put on (lie Ways and Means Committee, and, in foct, seems hardly 'able to get fiver It. The country lias tolerated Judge Kkllkt'8 offensive llllibustering for extreme "protection," on this e immittce. Quito long enough. The name of KiLLKThns long been svnonvinmij with pig iron and high tariff; and few tears will alien"1 in his ratiremont in' this part of the country The agricultural m iss of the West now bare tho fltor. In regard' to the ''School ot Journalism, re cently established at Cornell L'nircrsity, tho Chicago llrpiihlicnn has this to say: " Tbe ad. vantages ortlus are apparent. After at young man bas gone through a sii years' course of philosophy, fliilology, phonography, photo gnipliy, phreuolry, political ecenrniT, jurispru dence, and the like, he will be able to go, with out any hesitation, to tbe office of any news paper, to receive a situation as managing edi' tor or fire reporter, and to be kicked out in a week for incompetency. The journalist, liko the poet, is bo rn, not made." m m The latest advices frjra Mcxi:nare to the ef fect that the rovolt agnin.it the government ia . wide-spread, and ft is already assumed formida ble proportions. Internacine war Las always been a bane te Mexican prosperity, and the un happy people of thtt' country will yet have to look to the United States for delireranee. The Columbus its-tee says if our country were to end an army across the Kio Orande, suppress the rival factions, and aanex the territory, i' would prove a blessing to that people and bene fit to tbe world. Dut it is nut Mexico alone we want. The West Indies aro as naturally a pai of our country as 'Mexico. General Grant could find no better opportunity to imtnorUliz0 himself and to add to the grandeur of tbe United States than to save Mexico from herself, and ' Cuba, the Queen of the Indies, from the Span iards. Col. Shannon and Eber Wilson tbe new Com missioner, entertained a few friends after the Lyceum Tuesday night with an nrster supper, after which all hands adjourned to the Lease House to enjoy a general good tirao. The Has kina boys led olT with music and songs. The Howling Green boys furnished lots of applause, and n-ha furnished the milk punch we cannot testify. IKoon! County Scnlintl. ErtRS well knew when he penned tbe above that if there was any punch drank on tbateven ing, neither Col. Shannom nor Commissioner Wilson furnished it. Ho did not dare make the charge direct but by his allusion to milk punch in the forccning connnection, ha intended it to bo Inferred that Col. SnNNONhad united jo furn ishing it and thereby proved recreant to his tem perance principles. Some nun are so unfortunately constituted' that they con never alludo to a subject, however harmless, having any relation to an object ot their dislike, without giving rent to their spleen and malice. The control of a public press by im of this olass, Is a public calamity. But iu bis instance "The riper it gnawing a file," The Message and Department Reports. Simultaneously with the Presidents Message we this week furnish our patrons with a pretty full synopsis of the several Department Reports, which will make the Journal this week a val uable paper to file away for future refera.ice. We hare alrealy commented upon some of the leading features of the message, and ask for it, which it will bsar, a careful reading. PonNlT'i Wukly Pre-, in speaking of the message, says : ' When in any Slate paper every sentence i a text, it is difficult to write upon it within the limits of a newspaper article. This is m st emphatically the case with the Pres ident's message. It is a model business p iper a compression of fac Is that reads like an invoice. Ivery word means something, and every sen tence tells or suggests something; It is a pa per clear, enmprebonsire, and concise, which ' every voter can read and ought to read ; and than this no higher praise can be awarded." Curse of the Liquor Traffic. While very much ha been said regarding the evils of Intemperance and of its mainspring, the trnffU in iutnxicating drinks, yet but a small por tion of its bad consequences are really known. In whatever aspect we view them, they stand forth before the civilization of the age as a hid eous moral and social deformity, affecting alike very class and condition of society with a curse snore potent than that Indicted by the fabled shirt of Xkssus, to remove which, tore the skin from the back of its victim. Tbe trafRo iu strong drink is in all its details and developments, a damning, unmitigated curse. It is the main cause of more than one-half of our criminal tri ads ; it burdens the people with taxes ; it occa sions strife between neighbors I it ruins many generous-hearted business men ; it brings dis grace, misery and want on numerous families i it debasea the intellect and destroys the useful ness of aiany bright and intelligeut youths, and lures individuals of both sexes into the paths of infamy and debauchery, tbe end of which is death. It Is tbe fruitful source of every kind o fraud and dishonor. There is not one redeem, ing quality manifest In the whole traffic. Those who are engaged in it are aware of its pernicious consequences, of the ruin and misery which it no" oasions. They know when they present the liq uor, teltieir infatuated victim, that there is death fii the cup, for they haye aided in mixing the Villainous compound of fusil oil and cayenne pepper. They know when the take the money ftvim their victims fur the poison, that they are hastening htintu the drunkard's grave and are thereby duprivlng his children of bread and In Hiding iuexprosaible niUery on the wife whom lie had sworn to protect and cherish. All this, I'or what? Simply that men may live iu la'eness and accumulate wealth at Ike cost of their eus- looter's honor, happiness and life. They are very williug to sea the drunkard sink iu death nd kit famllj become paupers, so that they may grow fat end lAr families wallow in afftuauce and luxury, Hueii are but a few of the details (if this cursed an debasing trafllo f With tbe knowledge of this state of facts In our Midst with the habitual drunkards wandering on nur streets and with their suffering families tailing for our sympathv, ought we nut, by ev ery motive of self respect, for the honor ot this community and the well-being of all alasses of itliens use every effort to suppress this did, on- treble aud debusing Ir.llir; Public Swindling. It is a fact generally known and well estab lished,. Hi at for the past six or eight years the owners of property In Wood county hare been made to pay large sums of money for pnbllo im provements in proximity to their property, out of all proportion to the real value of the work done; The peculiar process by which such re sults hare been atlalued,are forcibly illustrated by the following bill presented to the Commis sioners by Ihs County Surveyor, Mr. Wood i cost bill ON mraoyrn road no, 30 libshtt Township.

STAFFORD. It will be seen fmm tho above statement made by one of the parties, Mr. Stafford, that N. II. Wood, the County Surveyor, bas wilfully snd deliberately attempted by fraudulent representa tions, to obtain p ty from the county for double the amount of work that was actually deue. With such evidence of an attempt to delraud the tax-payers, thero can be but little confldenci placed hereafter in Mr. Wood's eatimatcs of work In be done, or bill of charges for its per formance. This seems to us to be a case in which the County CVnimiisludcrj should act promptly In behalf of the tax-payers, by enforc ing the law against Corrupt officials. Iiet him be removed from office. The people have had euoiigh of that class of officials. Mr. Stafford deserves thanks for exposing the fraudulent attempt. It la unnecessary add that tba Commissioners "cut it down." LETTER FROM MONTGOMERY TWP. SCHOOLS. Ed, Journal t The winter term of our Dis trict Schools which havo just Commenced, prom iscs to be belter than usual. I see by the Jovr Nal, thnt the scholarship of the teacher graded higher. Several of the certificates are marked tat class. The community at large owe a debt of gratitude to the Board of Examiners t whose untiring exertions this progress in the kuowleJgeuf those branches taught ia onr schools, is mainly due. While Teachers' Insti tutes and Union Schools come in for no small share of praise, the standard of scholarship set up by the Hoard of Examiners. They gauge and mark the scale. A schoolmaster is theoret ically an 1 oftentimes praotically a pronoun of the Jtrwt woi, ttieiifur number, but whether he shall be clothed with the p-iwer to be and to do or lo tnjfer, depends very much upon the wilof those janitors who stand at the door of the people's colleges. His office that is our own school master'sis a very high one and he a very dis tinguished personage, not the Chief Magistrate of the nation to be sure, but he is, and no mis take, one of the chiefs of the people at tbe other endnf society. Said a political philosopher, ' give me the national song-maker, and I wil1 mould the character of the nation." We say, give us the typo of the schoolmaster and we will fortel the tvpeof the nation. Therefore we say take euro of the ped igngue. Teach young America to take off his hat if heaver does-aud b w bifure the Chief Magistrate of the Sehoo) House. He is no longer boss by virtue of the 'beech' or 'birch ;' Uncle Sam docs not give him that sceptre now a days. His peculiar province it in the realm of mind in distinction fp'in mat ter. Nevertheless it is matter enough lo take Fare of a whole household of peers, such stuff as American jurors snd legislators are made of. AnJ, therefore, it is expectedthat our aforesaid schoolmaster will assert his dignity and make the people bear in mind that, if be is Dot President of the Uaitod States, some one of his pupils not may be, but will be at some future day. Such being the position of the schoolmaster in relation to the country be ought to be induc ted into office with due cerem my. Let him ap pear before the Board of Examiners and band in bis checks. Let that grand jury of tbe A B C'a of literature take him thoroughly in hand and before he gets quite thr iug!i give him to under stand clearly that it is no boys play to became tbe supreme ruler in a district school house. would here very modestly suggest don't be fiightened dear reader that two who!.- days be occupied in the examination of our schoolings ters and one hole t veiling added to that service by war of meditation. The time and money would be a good investment. The Dutch, the Irish, the English and the 'Chinee, if he ever comes te our schools, will feel tbe good effects of such a drill. And every person must admit that such a course could not trust the everlast ing Yankee. If there are farces and humbugs enacted all around us, let not our own national schoolmaster play at these games right before the face and eyes of Uncle Sam's children. Let His Excellency, the schoolmaster, be 'true blue.' We don't mean lo slight the ectioolmaruis. AN EX

LETTER FROM WEBSTER TOWNSHIP. SCOTCH RIDGE, Dec. 13, 1871. I Ed. Joubxai. : Tho Jolkmal 'a last visitation brings your tribulation entitled, "Proscription Saloon Keepers on the Rampsge," which is to say the least refreshing ; chiefly so, pcrplaps on account of being so unexpected. I say unexpected and because from Perrys burg we had reason to expect better things. 1 he whole matter is so full of meannesss as to rx it digust and we imagine the gentlemeBv(T) nhose names head your article, must envy the j ub- Iication of their names in such a connection. Your correspondent, Mr. Editor, feels keenly upon the subject which this act has Jiutroduccd, and as a citizen of a great State with righteous codes and just enactments, he demands of its laws protection iu his citizeusbip Cor big home and family. But the signs of the times are surely threatening to such interests. If he locate in a city of his State, ho is in fear of violence and disaster from contact with misery and wretch edness retailed at the street corners under the y.-ry eyes of tbe statutes that have go irantetd in a measure hie happiness aud prosperity. If ne is ins viotisn ct inordinite thirst and app tite -tlie very dtuion that haunts him and places iu bis hand the cup which be would" shun, yet c.innut be slakes his thirst in the bowl of ruin aud desolation. I am led to these bitter thoughts by the article to which I refer. Intem perance is the finger tt at lays on our land and State and commonwealth the deathless curse to blight our happiness, and almost tbe only agent that opposes our perfect prosperity. Aaa na tlon, we are enlightened ;onr people aro educated; eur land is at peace:: we have liberty : crime is decreasing and virtue would ullimitely prevail Indeed, have yeu thought aa a people and nation and land, how highly favored we are, and the benificent blessings we enjoy t There is scare a blight to m ir it all, saro Iutemperance. The means to destroy this, hare wisely been provi ded we have in our statutes sucb means, but weak officers of tbe law waitor the calls of the people to exeroise their jus tcnforceincnt, Tbe popular will is reflected through the press aud to the press they appeal for such reflection. And to-day, the truth is, every honest, honor able citize.i appoals to the press of Wood county, to the press uf Ohio and of this mighty nation to say to the world that our interests and happi ness demand that the demon of intemperance shall stalk our streets no more. We ask the Journal to stand boldly and manfully upon .this platform. The time has come when we should no longer bend and succumb to wrongs wrongs hire ruled us too loug and their traces yon can read to-lay on our country's altar lu words written inhuman blood. Talk abjut proscription of rumsellersl The day has b-ieu when the alareholder proscribed fie ab ilitionist. The murderer proscribes the officer of lha law that metes Justice to him. Onr I it le world is full uf proscription, yet who will burnt orm erve from principles that are noble and ri'ht, and just and full of golden promise T In couclusiou, Mr, biitor. Wood county's right m'udud citizins applaud that yon are found iu the interests of Temperance ,Jand your tribula tion will receive their sympathy and the sequel will s-iuw that Ihs eiticiif of Perrytburg, wheth er it is shown by petition or not, are in warm co operation with the act which ia asked of your Council, And another thing that the sequel will develop is, that there are iu jii engaged In a uefarinus bu siness in your midst who will live to curse them selves that they have blasted hopes and ruined hearts aa light and happy as those that daily prattle at their owu hearthstones.
