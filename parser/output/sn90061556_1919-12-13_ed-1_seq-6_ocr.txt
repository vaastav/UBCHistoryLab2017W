Oscar MIschauex's wonderful new picture, "Within Our Gates," which' will undoubtedly rival any preachment , picture ever produced. Is now before tho Chicago Board of Censors. Mr MIschauex is tho producer of "The Homesteader," an unusual picture which developed nation-wide popular- Ity. The new picture deals with the present tinrest of the races in Ameri ca, showing things as they exist, and suggests a remedy. A beautiful ro-' manco is carried throughout the pte-l ture.

That's the stuff. 

GOVERNOR GARDNER ACTS. t That tho delegation of Ministers who were sent to Jefferson City last week obtained results relative to the recent lynching at Moberly, Mo., is evi denced by the ifollowing letter re ceived by the Rev. Dr. W. E. Shaw of this city, secretary of the committee. It Is as follows: "My Dear Dr. Shaw: Tho Governor lias addressed a letter to the Prosecut ing Attorney of Randolph County urging n thorough investigation of the recent lynching and has also official ly ordered the attorney general of the state to assist the prosecutor of the county in making a complete and sweeping investigation and hring be foro tho bar of justice all those who violated the law. The Governor has always taken a stron? stand for law and order and you will find Doctor, from examination of the records that there have been very few Iynchings of oither white or Colored in this state. For the Governor, S. V. BAXTER, Private Sec'y."
