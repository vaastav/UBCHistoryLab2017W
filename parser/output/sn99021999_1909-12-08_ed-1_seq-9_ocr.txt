ANNUAL MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT TAFT TO THE CONGRESS Recommendations for Legislation on Matters Much Discussed and of Real Importance in Connection With the Prosperity of the People 

PRESIDENT TAFT'S annual mes sage to the congress was read In both houses at noon -today. It vm very short In comparison .with recent documents of a similar nature, containing fewer than 14,000 words. In It la found brief but pointed reference to all matter f publle Importance, wj.th direct recom mendation or Significant suggestion for legislative, action. The message, oondensed In part, la aa follows:-' To the Senate and the Hour of Repre-, aentatlves: The relatlona of the United States with all foreign governments have continued upon the normal basis of amity and good understanding and Are very generally sat isfactory, j" (The president riches briefly on the teference to the ffeherleg case between the United States and .Qrtut Britain to The Hague tribunal; 'to the work of the In ternationaj Fisheries commission; the ad justment' of International boundaries and ther disputes ,olween the United States and Canada; further orbteetlon for the eeal fisheries; 4he second peace conference t The Haguej tjie International conference on maritime law, and on uniform hills of xchange; the invitation of Belgium to participate In the exposition at Brussels, for which he urges acceptance and an ap propriation; the adjustment of affairs in tha Congo and the commission to Liberia, th report of the latter to be submitted later; the convention with Oermanv con cerning patents; the Invitation of Norway to participate In a conference to determine tha status of the Spitsbergen Islands, and tha result of tha revolution in Turkey). Relatione with Sooth America. ' Ona of, tha ha priest events In recnt Pan American diplomacy xVas the pacific Inde pendent settlement by the governments of Bolivia and Peru of a boundary difference between them, which for aome weeks threatened to cause war and even to en train embltterments affecting other re publics less directly concerned. From vari ous quarters, directly or indirectly con aerrwd, tha Intermediation of the United State was sought to assist In a solution f tha controversy. Desiring at all times t abstain from any undue mingling In the affairs of sister republlea and having faith In the ability , of tha governments of Peru and Bolivia themselves to settle their dif ference In a manner satisfactory to them selves, which, .viewed with magnanimity, would esstiape all embltterment, this gov ernment steadily abstained from being drawn Into the 'controversy and was much gratified to find Its confidence justified by event. On the th of July next ther will open at Buenos Ayrei the fourth Pan-American conference, This conference will have a special meaning to the hearts of all Amer icans, because around its date are clus tered the anniversaries of the Independence of so many of tha American republics, it la not necessary for tn to remind ' the congress of the political, social and oom- merclal Importance ol thee gatherings. You are asked - to make liberal appropria tion for our participation. If this be granted, it la my purpoa to appoint a dis tinguished and representative delegation, qualified fittingly to represent thia country and to deal with the problems of inter continental interest which will there be discussed. ' ' . 1 ' . Tha Argentine rpubllo will also hold from May to November, 1910, at Buenos Ay res, a great International agricultural exposition, In which the United States has been invited to participate! . Conaldertng the rapid growth of tha trade of the United States with tha Argentina republic and the cordial, relatlona existing between the two nations, together with tha fact that it pro vides an opportunity to show defereno to a alster rapubllo on tha occasion of the celebration of tta national independence, the proper department of this govern ment are taking steps to apprise the Inter ests concerned of the opportunity afforded by this exposition, , in which appropriate participation by thla country la so deslr able.

All the bends will be greatly strengthened as time goes on and Increased 'faculties, such as the greet bank soon to be established in' Latin Amer lea, supply the means for building up the coloeral Intercontinental commerce of the future. ' . " , My meeting with President Diaz and the greeting exchanged on both American and Mexican soil served, I hope, to signalize the close and cot dial relations which so well bind together this republic and th great' republic Immediately to the south, between which there Is so vast a network of material Interests. I am happy to say that all but on of the cases which for so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have been settled within the last few months and that, under the enlightened regime now directing the gov ernment of Venesuela, provision hat been mad for arbitration of the remaining caso before The Hague tribunal. Claims of American Cltlsena. On July SO. 1905, the government of ran am a agreed, after considerable nego tiation, to indemnify the relatives of the American officers and sailors who were brutally treated, one of them having, in deed, been killed by the Panaman police this year. This government was obliged to Intervene diplomatically to bring about arbitration or settlement of the claim of, tha Emery company against Nicaragua, which it had long before been agreed thould be arbi trated. A settlement of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a protocol on September 18, 1909. Many years ago diplomatic Intervention became necessary to the protection of the Interests In the American claim of Alsop & Co. against the , government of Chile. The government of Chile had fre quently admitted obligation In the case and had promised .this government to settle It' There had been two abortive at tempts to do so through arbitral com mission, which failed through lack' ef Jurisdiction.' Now,' happily, as th result of the recent diplomatic negotiations, th governments of th United States and of Chile, actuated by .the sincere desire to free from any strain ' thoso cordial and friendly relations upon ' which' both aet such store, have agreed by a protocol- ,t submit the controversy to definitive set tlement by His Brltannlo Majesty, Edward VII.- ' Case of Zelaya. Slnco the Washington convention of 1W1 wer communicated to the government of the United States as a consulting and advising party, thla government has been almost continuously called upon by on or another, and In turn by all of the five Central American republics, to exert Itself for the maintenance of tha conventions. Nearly every complaint has been against the Zelaya government of Nicaragua, which hat kept Central America In con stant ten-Ion or turmoil. The responses made to the representations of Central American republics, as due from the United States on kecount rjf its relation to the washing-! ton conventions, have been, at all ' times conservative and have avoided, so far as possible, any semblance of Interference, although It Is very apparent that the con-, alterations of geographic' proximity of the Canal Zone and of the very substantial American Interests in Central America give to th United States a apeolal position In the sone of . these republics and th Caribbean sea. - I need not rehearse here the patient ef forts of this government to promote peace and w el far among these republics, efforts which are; fully appreciated by the ma jority of them who are loyal to their true Interests. , It would be no less unneces sary to rehearse her the sad ta'.e of un speakable barbarities and oppression air leged ' to ' have been committed by the Zelaya government. ' Recently two Ameri cans were put to death by order of Presi dent Zelaya himself. They wer reported to have been regularly commissioned of ficers In the organized forces of a revolu tion which had continued many weeks and was proceeding In an orderly ' fashion in control, of about half of the republic, and as auch, according to the modem enlight ened practice of . civilized nations, they would be entitled to be dealt with as prisoners of war. At th data when thla message la printed thla government Is proceeding with de liberate' circumspection to determine th exact truth In relation te thee report and upon th eeuree In th premises moat consistent with Its dignity, Its duty to Amerlean Interests and Its moral obliga tions to Central America and to civiliza tion. Work of a Bureau. Th International bureau of American republics has carried on an Important and Increasing work during th lost' vear. In the exerels ef Its peculiar functions as sn Internationa: agency, maintained by all the American republics for the develop' ment of Pan-American commerce and friendship, It has accomplished a great practical good which could be done In the ma way by no Individual department cr bureau of one government, and is there fore deserving of your liberal support. The fact that It Is abcut to enter a new build ing, erected through the munificence of an American philanthropist and tb contrlbu lions ef all the American nstlcns. where both Its efficiency of administration and expense of malntenence will naturally b much augmented, further entltlea It to special consideration. In th far cast thla government preserve unchanged Its policy of supporting th principle ef equality, ' of opportunity, and scrupulous respect for the Intergrlty of the Chinese Empire, to which policy are pledged th latrsted powers of both east and west. - ' Relatlona with China. By the treaty of 1903 China boa under taken the abolition of llkln with a moderate and proportionate raising of th customs tariff along with currency reform. These reforms being of manifest advantage to J foreign commerce aa welj as to th Interests of China, thla government Is endeavoring to facilitate these measure and th need ful acqulscence of th treaty powers. When It appearead that Chinese llkln revenues were to be hypothecated to foreign bankers In connection with a great railway project. It was obvious that the government whose nationals held this loan would hav a certain direct Interest la the question of th Mrrylng ut by China of th rfrm la queetlon. Because this railreed lean rprnted a practical and real epplloa Ua of th open doer pellcy threusb o oparatlea with China by lntrtd pes' era, a well aa beoauda ( lu rlaUaa to to referm referred I obov. th. ad mini tro ll dnd American prtle1p4ia t he f great aaltoaeX later.

Amerioans should also tak part in th xp'osltlon. to b held at Pneros Ayres next summer. American citizens ar to be proteoted In person and property In any fore lrn country. Th Monro doctrin has not been abandoned th de velopment of Central and South American oonntrles has largely removed th necessity for Its assertion, and It will not b lnvkd to enable any government to cceap its obligation or payment of just debt.

Reorganisation of administrative department of th government la necoeasary, that greater tffloiency may ba secured at a leaa expenditure of time, effort and money. This will require a reclassification of th civil servioe. A civil ssrvlce pension list la recommended. Investigation of custom hens fraud and prosecution of th guilty 1 undr way and an Inquiry by oongrss la deprecated, because It might result la giving Immunity to cm of th guilty person. wo one is seeking a tariff war la which th spirit of Mtallatlcn will ha reused, and In th xrcls of th dls ' oretlonary pewr eted In hint by law th president hope to avoid any auch result. Three year will b required for th tariff hoard to tha this opportunity should not be lost, th lndlspensabl inatrumentallty presented itself when a group of American bankers, of international reputation and great re sources, agreed at once to ahar i the I nun unon nreclsely such terms as this government ahould approve. The chief of those terms was that American railway material should be upon an xaet equality with that of the other nationals Joining in the loan in the placing of orders for this whole railroad system. After months of negotiation the equal participation of American aeems at last assured. It is gratifying that Americans will thus take their ahar in thla extension of thtse great highways of trade, and to believ that auch activities will give a real Impetus to our commerce And . will , provts a. practical corollary to our nistorio poucy in me wr east. Thv'ImPer1!- Chinese ' governrtfent In pursuance' of lta decision to devote funds from the portion of th indemnity remitted by the United States to the sending of students to this country hss already com pleted' arrangements for carrying out this purpose, and a considerable body of students have arrived to take up their work in our schools and universities. No one can doubt the happy effect that the associations formed by these representa tive young men will have when they re turn to take up their work In the pro gressive development of their country. Control of Opium Traffic, . The results of the opium conference held at Shanghai .last spring at the ' Invitation of the United States have been laid be fore the government. The 'report shows that China Is making remarkable progress and admirable efforts toward the eradica tion of the opium evil and that the govern menta concerned have not allowed their commercial interest to Interfere with a he'pful co-operation In this reform. Col lateral Investigations of the opium ques tion is this country lead me to recommend that the manufacture, sale and use , of opium and Its derivatives In the United States should be so far possible more rigor ously controlled by legislation. Our traditional relatlona with th Jap anea mpir continue cordial aa usual. Aa the representative of Japan, HI Im perial Hlghn Princ Kunl visited the Hudson-Fulton celebration. The recent visit of a delegation of prominent buslneo men a guest of the chamber of.com merc ef the Pacific elope, who repre sentative had been so agrsoably received In Japan, will ioubtlees contribute to the growing trsde serene the Paclfln, as well ss to that triatrial understanding which leads to mutua! appreciation. The arrange ment" of 151 for a co-operative control of the coming of laborers to the United Statea has proved to work satisfactory. The matter of a revision of the existing treaty between the United Statea and .lapan which is terminable In 1912 is al vesdy receiving tha study of both coun tries. The Pepartment of State Is considering the revision In whole or in part, of the existing treaty with Slam, which was con cluded In lSf.4 and is now, In respect te many of Its provisions, out of data.

Th consular aervlc haa been greatly Improved under the law of April . l'.06, and the executive order of June 17, 190S, and I commend to your consideration the question of embodying In a statute the principles of the present executive order upon which the efficiency of our consular aervlco la wholly dependent.

Authority to appoint a com mission to report en the desirability of holding aa expo itloa to show tha porsress of th negro la requested. the agencies of the government which can contribute anything to Its efficient handling. As a consequence of section I of the tariff aet of August 6. 1903, it become the duty of the secretary of state to con duet as diplomatic business all the negotia tions neesary to place him in a posi tion to advise me as to whether or not a particular country unduly discriminates against the United States In the sense of the statute referred to. The great scops and complexity of this work, as well as the obligation to lend all proper aid to our expanding commerce, Is met by the expansion of the bureau of trade rela tions as set forth in the estimates for the Deportment of State. Expenditure and Revenue. -,"! Perhaps the most important question pre sented to this administration Is that of economy In expenditure and sufficiency at revenue, 'the deficit of the lost fiscal year, and the certain deficit of the cur sent year, prompted congress to throw a greater responsibility on the executive and the secretary of the treasury than had heretofore been declared by statute. This declaration impose upon the secretary of the treasury the duty of assembling an the estimates of the executive depart ment bureaus, and offices, of the expen ditures necessary In the ensuing fiscal year, and of making an estimate of the revenues of the government for the same period; and If a probable deficit is thus shown. It is made the duty of the presldeni to recommend the method by whlcn sJen dtficlt can be met. The report of the secretary shows that the oidinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30. 1910, will exceed the estimated receipts by J4.0T5,6aO. If to this deficit Is added the sum to be dis bursed for the Panama canal, amounting to M, 000,000, and )1,iOO,000 to be paid on the pubiio dept. th deficit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will be Increased to a total def.clt of 73,073,620. This deficit the secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds issued to pay the cost of con structing the Panama canal. I approve thia proposal. lhe policy of paying for the construction of the Panama canal, not out of current revenue, but by bond issues, was adopted la the Spooner aet of ltJ. and thr seem to b n god raaem for departing from th prina.pi by which a part, at laat, of th burden f th coot of th canal snail fall upun ur poMortty wao ar to njuy It; and thor I ail th mor reaeon for nus view boaus th actual cast to aVat f th canal, which 1 now half den and which will b completed January 1, ink, shews that the cost of engineering and con struction will b 7,TM,000, instead of il39, rct.zeo, aa originally estimated. In addition to engineering and construction, the other expenses, including sanitation and govern ment, and th amount paid for the proper ties, the franchis and the pilvilee of building th canal, increase the cost by ;5,3o,OuO, to a total of 37o,201,0O0. The in crease In the coat of engineering and con struction Is due to , a substantial en largement ' of the plan .of construc tion by widening the canal lOu feet la the Culebra cut and by Increasing the dlaansln of th locks, to ths under otlanat ef th quantity ef the work to b dene under the original plan, and te an uauereUnie of ths root ef labor and snateiiol, btti ef which have greatly n iuuit4 In price stnee the original estimate wo made. , Meadloc Off th Deficit. la order te aietd a deficit for the ensu ing fiscal year, I directed the heads of de partments tn the preparation of their esti mate to make them aa low aa poss.ble consistent with Imperative governmental necessity. The result haa been, as I am advised by the atcrelary of the treasury, that the estimates of the expenses of the government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911 that is, for the next fiscal year are less by $,613.000 than the total of ap propriations for the current fiscal year, and less by (94.000,000 than the estimates for that year. Eo far as the aecretary of the treasury is able to form a Judgment as to future Income, and compare it with the .expenditure for the next fiscal' year ending June SO, 1911. including the pay menta on account of the Panama canal and the public debt, ther will be no deficit In the year ending fun 80, 111, but a small surplus f flll.OM. , la the present estimate th need f th department and f tji government have been ut to th qulak, o to speak, and any aaaumpUaa oa the part of aongreea, a often made la time peal, that th ti mote hav been prepared with th ex pectation that they may bo reduced, will result tn seriously hampering proper ad ministration. Reform la Administration. j It has been Impossible In the preparation of estimates greatly to reduce the cost of permanent administration. This can not be done without a thorough reorganisa tion of bureaus, offices and departments. For the purpose of securing Information which may enable the executive and the legislative branches to unite In a plan for the permanent reduction of the cost of governmental administration, the Treasury department has instituted an Investigation by one of the most skilled ' expert ac countants In the United States. The result of his work In two or thre bureaus, which, If extendi-d ito the entire government, must occupy two' or more years, has been to show much room for improvement and op portunity for substantial reductions In the cost and increased efficiency of adminis tration. The object of the Investigation is to devise means to Increase the average efficiency of each employe. Tet there Is great room for Improvement toward this end, not only by the reorganization ot bureaus and departments and tn the avoid ance of duplication, but also in the treat ment of the Individual employe. Under the present system It constantly happens that two employee receive the same salary when the work of one Is far more difficult and important and exacting than that of the other. Superior ability Is not rewarded or encouraged. As lhe classification is now entirely by salary, an employe often rises to the highest class while doing the easiest work, for which alone he may be fitted. An Investigation ordered by my predecessor resulted In the recommendation that the civil service be reclassified according to the kind of work, so that the work requiring most application and knowledge and ability Bhsll receive most compensation. I believe such a change would be fairer to the whole force and would permanently Improve the personnel of the service. Civil Service Penalona, ' More than this, every reform directed toward the Improvement In the average efficiency of government employes must depsnd on the ability of th executive to eliminate frem the government service the who ar inefficient frem any cause, and as the degree ef efficiency ,1n all the departments Is much leeeened by the reten tion of oid employes who have- outlived their energy and usefulness It I indls panslbi to any proper system ef economy that provision be mad that their sepa ration from the servloe shall be easy snd Inevitable. It Is Impossible to make such provision unless ther is adopted a plan of civil pensions. Meet of the great Industrial organizations and many of the well conducted railways of this country are coming to the conclu sion that a system of pensions for old em ployes snd the substitution therefor of younger and more energetic servants pro motes both economy and efficiency of ad ministration. I am aware that there is a strong feeling In both houses of congress, and possibly In the country, against the establishment ef civil pensions, and that this has natu rally grewn out of the heavy burden cf military pensions, which It hss always been the pelley ef our government te as sume; but I am strongly convinced that ko other practical solution ef the difficulties presented by the superannuation ef c'vll aervar.ta son be found than that of a sys tem of civil pensions. Costosa Hoame Pre oris. I regret t rcr t th fact of th dla rovry of extensive frauds In the eollec tlen of the ruetoma revenue at New Tork rtty, In whleh a number ef the subordinate employee In the weighing and other de partment were directly concerned, and in which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar Refining company and others. The frauds consisted In the payment of duty on underweights of sugar. The government has recovered from the American Sugar Refining company' all that it is shown to have been defrauded of. The sum was re ceived In full of the amount due, which might have been recovered by civil suit against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there waa an express reservation In the contract of settlement by, which the set tlement should 'not Interfere with, or pre vent ths criminal prosecution of everyone who was found to be aubject to th same. Criminal proseoutlens are new proceeding against a number of th government offic ers. Th Treasury department and the De partment of Justice ar zrtlag avery effort to dlocovr all th wrvngdeor. In cluding th officer and aiploy f th oiDpaul who may hav bon privy t th defraud It wuld om t m that an Investigation of th fraud by oon gra at prooent, ponding th probing by tb Treasury department and th Depart ment of Justice, as proposed, might by giving Immunity and otherwise prove an etv.harraesment In securing conviction of the guilty parties. Mo Tariff War. Two features of the new tariff act call for special reference. V virtue of the clause known aa the ' maximum and mini mum" clause, it is the duty of the exe cutive to consider the laws and practices of other countries with reference to the Importation Into those countries of the products and merchandise of the United States, and If the executive finds such laws and practices not to be unduly dis criminatory against the United States, the minimum duties provided in the bill are to go into force. Unless the president makes such a finding, then the maximum duties provided in the bill, that is, an Increase of 25 per cent ad valorem over the minimum duties, are to be in force. Fear has been expressed that this power conferred and duty Imposeed on the execu tive 1b likely to lead to a tariff war. 1 1 beg to exrress the hope and belief that no such result nerd be anticipated. The discretion granted to the executive by the terms "unduly discriminatory" Is wide. In order that the maximum duty shall be charged against the Imports from a country. It Is necessary that he shall find on the part of that country not only discriminations In Its laws or the practice under them against the trade of the United States, but that the dlscrlmlna- i tlons found shall be undue; that Is, with out good and fair reason. I conceive that this power was reposed In the president with the hope, that the maximum duties might never be applied In any case, but that the power to apply them would en able the president and the State depart ment through friendly negotiation ,to se cure the elimination from the lawa and the practice under them of any foreign country of that which Is unduly discriminatory. No one Is seeking a tariff war or a con dition In which the spirit of retaliation shall be aroused. Work ef Tariff Commission. The new tariff law enables me to ap point a tariff board to assist me in con- I nectlon with the Department of State In the administration of the minimum and maximum clause of the act and also to assist officers of the government In the administration of the entire law. An ex amination of the law and an understanding of the nature of the facts which should be considered In discharging the functions im posed upon the executive show that I have the - power to direct the tariff board tn make a comprehensive glosKS-y and ency clopedia of the terms used and articles em braced In the tariff law, and to secure In formation as to the cost ot production ot such goods in this country and the cost of their production In foreign countries. I have therefore appointed a tariff board consisting of three members and have di rected them to perform all the duties above described. This work will perhaps take two or three yeara, and I ask from con gress a continuing annual appropriation equal to that already made for Its prosecu tion. I believe that the work of this board will be of prime utility and importance whenever congress shall deem It wise again to readjust the customs duties. Changea la the Army. The secretary of war calls attention to a number of needed changes in the army In all of which I concur, but the point upon which I place most em phaals Is the need for an elimination bill providing a method by which the merits ot officers shall have some effect upon their advancement and by which th advance ment of all may be accelerated by the ef fective elimination of a definite proportion of the least efficient. There are in every army, and certainly In ours, a number of officers who do not violate their duty in any such way as to give reason for a court-martial or dismissal, but who do not show such aptitude and skill and character for high command as to Justify their re maining in the active service to be pro moted. Provision should be made by which they may be retired on a certain proportion of their pay, increasing with their length of service at the time of retirement. There Is now a personnel law for the navy whleh Itself needs amendment and to which 1 shall make further reference. Such a law la needed quite aa much for the army. Coast Defea. Th eoaat defames ef the United States proper are generally all that could be de sired, and In aomo respects they are rather more elaborate than under praeent condi tions arc needed to stop an enemy's fleet from entering th harbors defended. There Is, however, one place where additional de fense Is badly needed, and that is at the mouth of Chesspeeke bay, where It Is pro posed to make an artificial island for a fort which shall prevent an enemy'a fleet from entering this most important strategi cal base of operations on the whole At lantic and gulf coasts. I hope that ap propriate legislation will be adopted to se cure the construction of this defense. The military and naval Joint board have unanimously agreed that It would be un wise to make the large expenditure which at one time were contemplated In the establishment ef a naval base and station In th Phillppln Islanda, and hav ex pressed their Judgment, In which I fully concur. In faver of making an oxtenalve t.aval basest Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not In the Phlllpplnea. Thl doe not dispense with the neeeeeity for th eem paratlvely small approprlatlona required to finish the proper eoaet dafensea in th Philippines now under eenetruetten on the Island cf Corregtder and elsewhere or to eernplete a suitable repair station and coal ing supply station at Olongapo, wher Is the floating dock "Dewey." I hope that this recommendation of the Joint board will nd the discussion as to the comparative merlta of Manila bay and Olongapo as naval stations, and will lead to prompt measures for the proper equipment and defense of Pearl harbor. Condition of the Navy. The return of the battleship fleet from ite voyage around 'he world. In more ef ficient condition than when It started, was a noteworthy event of Interest alike to our citizens and the naval authorities of the world. Besides the beneficial and far reaching effect on our personal and diplo matic relatione In the countries whleh th fleet visited, the marked success of the ships In steaming around the world In all weather en schedule time haa Increased respect for our navy and haa added to our national prestlg. Our onltated personnel rcrultd from all aectlen of the oountry la young and en ergetic and representative f th natlanal spirit. It la, moreover, owing to It In telligent, capabl of quick training into the modern man-of-warsmen. Our officers are earnest nnd zealous In their profession, but it Is a rerretable fart tlint the higher officers are eld for the responsibilities of tho modern navy, and the admirals do not arrive at flag rank young enough to ob tain ndeqnnto training In their duties as flag officers. This need for reform In the navy has been ably and earnestly presented to congress by my predecessor, and I alsJ urRPntly recommend the subject for con sideration. Uarly In the coming session a compre hensive plan f . r the reorganization ot ths officers of all corps of the navy w'll be presented to congress, and I hope It will meet with action suited to its urgency. Owing to the necessity for economy In expenditures. 1 have directed the curtail ment of recommendations for naval appro priations so that they are thirty-eight mil lions less than the corresponding estimates of Inst year, and the request for new naval construction Is limited to two first-class battleships and one repair vessel. Tho use of a navy Is for military pur poses, and there has been found need In ' the department of a military branch deal ing directly with the military use of tho fleet. The secretary of the navy has also felt the lack of responsible advisers to Bid him In reaching conclusions and deciding Important matters between oo-ordlnale branches of tho department. To aecur these results he has inaugurated a tenta tive plan involving certain changes In tho organization of the Navy department. In- eluding the nnvy yard's, all of which have been found by the attorney general to ba in accordance with law. I have approved the execution of the plan proposed because of the greater efficiency and economy It promises. Reform la Jadlrlal rroceuro. The deplorable delays In the administra tion of civil and criminal law have te celved tho attention of committees of the American Bar association and of many state bar associations, as well as the con sidered thought. of Judges and Jurists. In my Judgment a change In . Judicial proce dure, with a view to reducing Its expense to private litigants In civil cases and facil itating the dispatch of business and final decision In both civil and crmlnal cases, constitutes the greatest need In our Amer ican institutions. 1 do not doubt for una moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty exhibited In lynchlngs is di rectly due to the uncertainties and Injua tlce growing out of the delays in trials, Judgments and the executions thereof by our courts. Of course, these remarks apply quite as well to the administration of Jus tice In State court as to that in federal courts, and without making Invidious dis tinction It Is perhaps not too much to ay that, speaking generally, the defects arc less in the federal courts than In tho, state courts. Cut they are very great In the fed eral courta. The expedition with which bus iness is 'disposed of both on the civil and the criminal Side of English courts Under modern rules of procedure makes the de lay's in our courts seem archaic and bar barous. The . procedure in , the federal courts should furnish an example for the state courts. I presume It Is Impossible, without an amendment to the constitution, to unite under one form of action the pro ceedings at common law nnd proceedings In equity in tho federal courts, but It is certainly not impossible by a statute to simplify and make short and direct the procedure both at law and in equity In thOMA rniirtn It im nn lmnna.11.1. a down still more than It Is cut down the Jurisdiction of the supreme court so aa to confine it almoet wholly to statutory and constitutional questions. Under the present statutes . the equity and admiralty proce dure In the federal courts Is under the con trol of tho supreme court, but In tho pres sure of business to which that court Is subjected It is Impossible to hope that a radical and proper reform of tho federal equity prooedure can be brought about. I therefore recommend legislation provld-' Ing for the appointment 'by the president, of a' commission with authority to exam ine the law in equity procedure of the fed eral' courts of first Instance, the law of appeals from ; those court to the couri of appeals and to the supreme court, and the costs Imposed In such proce dure upon the private litigants nnd upon ths public treasury and make recommenda tion with a view to simplifying and expe diting the procedure ss ftr ss possible ard making It as Inexpensive as may bo 1 the litigant of llttl mean. ' Aha of IaJaaoUona. Th platform of th successful party In th last lctlon contained tho following: The republican perty will uphold at ail times the authority and integrity of th courta, state and federal, and will ever Insist that their powera to enforce hlr process and to protect life, liberty and property shsll he preserved Inviolate. Wo believe, however, that the rules of pro cedure In the fedrl courts with reirpot to the issuance of the writ of Injunet'ea should be more accurately defined by statute and that no Injunction or temporary rcstra'nlng order should be Issued w ithout notice, except wher Irrepar-. able injury would result from dlav. In r nr-n e-s a, sreeay hearing thereafter should be granted. . . j I recommend that in compliance with th promise thus made, appropriate legislation be adopted. The ends of Justice will bent be met and th chief cause of complaint egalnst Ill-considered Injunctions w'thout notlro will b removed by the, ensctment of a statute forhlddlng hereafter the Issu ing of any Injunction or restraining ardor. i""rir mponrj or permanent, By any federal court, wlihout prevloua notice and a reosonsble opportunity to be heard on behalf ef the partlea to be enjoined; un less it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that the delay necessary to glv such notlee and hearing would result In Irreparable Injury to the complainant and unless also the court from the evidence make a written finding, which shall bo spread upon the court minutes, - that immediate and irreparable Injury Is likely to ensue to the compla'nant, and shall de fine the Injury, etate why It Is irreparable, and shall also endorse on the order Issued the date and "the hour of the Issuance of the order. Moreover, every such Injunction or restraining order utsud without pre vious notice and opportunity by th de fendant to be heard should by fnrce of the statute expire and be of no effjet after seven daya from the Issuance thereof or within any Urn leas than that period which tho court may fix, unless within euch seven days or such less period, the In junction or order Is extended or renewed after prevloua netlc and opportunity t) be heard. My Judgment Is that the passage of such an act which really smbodle the beet pi so il c In equity and I very Ilk th rul near In fore In m court will prevent the (Continued on Eleventh Tag.)
