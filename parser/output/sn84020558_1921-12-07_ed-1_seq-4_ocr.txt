Confucius. The Stata of Business We have been following pretty closely for the past year the observations of the Credit Clearing. House cf New York in credit checking. These sum maries are issued weekly. For the making of these observations the country is divided into sections the Pacific Coast, the Mountain, North Agricultural, Middle Agricultural, South Agricultural and the East sections. Arizona belongs in the mountain section.." . The average condition for the whole country to Xecember 3 of this year is summarized as follows: Purchases are more active than a week ago and a year ago, but less than two years ago. Indebtedness is less than a week ago and a year ago, but more than two years ago. Faytnents are less active than in any of the three periods cf comparison. Thus in estimating conditions there are three factors, purchases, indebtedness and payments. The mountain section contributes more than any other section to the better total showing of last week and toe highest showing of the last two years as follows: Purchases are more active than a week ago and a year ago, but less than two years ago. Indebtedness is less than in any of the three periods of comparison. Payments are much more active than last week, slightly less than a year ago, and less than two years .....

Do Fish ThinkT "Do fish think?" asks a would-be scientist. We do not know.. We have seen some "poor fish" who seemed not to think, but perhaps they did after a fashion. But any one who spends his time wonder ing about the intellectual equipment and operations of the so-called lower orders is about as useful to so ciety as an unthinking fish. To know whether fish think or not would per haps be some satisfaction of the curiosity of certain minds but that would be all. If it were- proved that fish do think we do not think that that would hasten the intellectual development of fisli to an alarming extent. And we do not know why fish should not think after a fashion. We have always suspected that all animals and insects which move from place to place evidently on business of their own were doing some sort of thinking. ' Suspicion of the minus quality of the fish's intel lect we suppose springs mostly from the fact that he doesn't seem to 'know enough to come in out of the wet." But there are humans who cannot stand that test. Considering all the things, and many of them al most certainly of great importance, that we two legged fish do not know; considering our pitiful mis takes, our starting in so many directions without ar riving anywhere; that we do not know any more than the scaly fish do whence we came or whither, we are going; that there may be superior beings in the air who are unprofitably wondering whether humans are gifted with reasoning powers; considering all these things we show some "crust' in debating whether fish can think. ... Formerly there was a sharp line drawn between man and the lower animals. On one side was reason ing power and on the other instinct. This line has been moved over on the side of the lower animals un til now we agree that many of them are endowed with a considerabl degree of rasoning power. the eyes of the whole American public. Had The Nation been a real friend to the great Frenchman of letters. It would have held out his article, and posted to him an exact statement of the facts. An intel lectual and a winner of the Nobel prize can get away with almost anything at all subtle; but he cannot get away with an assertion that Mary Garden is the American secretary of state, or that Sampel Gompers made 59 home runs In the American league last season. It happens that there are some elementary facts about themselves with which the Americans are, unfortun ately for M. France, familiar. Not even a great lit erary man is exempt from the duty of acquainting himself with the facta before he talks. A Road Experiment Illinois has a big road roads project on hand It wishes to make as sure as possible by experiment that it does the right thing In material and make-up of its highways. For this purpose the state in con junction with the federal government has built a stretch of road two and a half miles long near Spring field. On this stretch the clinic is being conducted, and exact observations are being made for guidance in the main project. In this road there are seven general types of paving. Represented in these types are the chief materials used in road building. Engineers will sub ject the several types to traffic of varying degrees of volume and weight, the maximum wheel-load to be 12,000 pounds or half as much again as the legal load in the state. Federal and state engineers have been taking fre quent daily observations of the effect of heat, cold, moisture and other elements that enter properly into such a test of wearing ability. Traffic tests are made with trucks, the leads of which are gradually in creased. These will be continued long enough to prove to the satisfaction of the engineers - the com parative endurance of the several types.' Those stretches that give out in advance of others will be discarded as not worthy of a place in the general scheme. This experiment is made at considerable expense. but the engineers believe that through them they will be able to save the state many millions of dol lars. At any rate, they will be able better to Justify themselves in the choice of materials and types of construction. It is important in the spending ot scores of mil lions of dollars for good roads that there be the ut most scientific information on the subject before hand. The final report - on ' trie Illinois experiment will be interesting to road builders throughout the country, whatever account may be taken of basic conditions elsewhere that are different from those in that state.

A home run hitter has no chance against such a moundsman as the "Kenesaw Kid." Phoenix is the most profitable field Mr. Roy Gardner has ever struck from his point of view publicity. He has had a longer run here and more attention than anywhere else along his ciroult. In most places he has had, so to speak, only one night stands, "in again, out again, gone again," a rapid sequence once described by the laconic Mr.. Flannl-gan. , The Louisville Courier-Journal finds fault with the president because he does not go into details. It might have charged him in the same indictment with a neglect to start the fires ot mornings, in the White House, of failing to milk the White House cow and of his avoidance of many other domestlce 'details. B!ut if the president does not himself personally at tend to details other men are doing it, among them, conspicuously, General Charles G. Dawes, director 1 general of the budget. The Wisest Err Even so wise a man as Anatole France who we hope is more than a passing fad, though we are not quite sure of it, notwithstanding he recently won one of the highest intellectual honors, the Nobel prize for literature has pulled a "boner." About the time we received news of the distinguished honor conferred upon him the Nation, New Tork, published an ap peal over his name for the saving of Sacco and Vanzetti under sentence of death in Massachusetts for murder. "In one of your states," says M. France to Amer ica "vwo men, Sacco and Vanzetti, have been con demned for a crime of opinion." Aside from the trifling detail that this is a flat misstatement of fact, we have no quarrel with M. France's assertion. From his mythical premise, he proceeds to develop a case against killing men for exercising the sacred right of opinion. M- France might as well have begun his appeal ly saying: "In one of your states two men, Sacco and Van zetti have been condemned for chewing gum." He might then have developed a persuasive case, showing the unwisdom of killing men for the crime of chewirg gum. This would all have been entirely unexceptionable, if somewhat platitudinous, though the reader might impatiently inquire just what bear- irg the polemic had upon the cases of Sacco and Var.zetti. Sacco and Vanzetti were convicted of the crime f murder by a SUTy in Massachusetts. The trial was .-irefullv conducted.

He would be in a friend's house, and in the course of conversation would ask: "Hev ye got a fiddler He knew his ground, and the answer would be in the negative. "What a peety." he would add, T ' would ha' played ye a tune." At last the occasion arose, as It was bound to do, when his oft-repeated query, "Hev ye got a fiddle?" came the eager response, "Yes, we've got a fiddle!" But Sandy was equal to the occasion. "So ye've got a fiddle," said he, stroking his chin, "and a fid dle's a grand thing to hev" Edinburgh Scotsman. DEPARTED A young man who was recently married thought he would take his wife to a little Sussex lodging house, where he used to spend his holidays. He told her he particularly wanted to go there, as they served such lovely honey at;every meal. The couple arrived, just In time for tea, so he escorted his wife proudly to a table in the dining room, then glanced round the board. There was no honey on the table, end none in the room. Very much surprised, he called a waiter. "Here." said he, "Where's my honey?" The waiter, at a loss what to say, finally leaned over the table and said in a stage whisper: "She doesn't work here now." Edinburgh Scotsman. RETURNING THE FAVOR "Have you ever made a serious effort to reform your fellow, men?" "Often, replied Senator Sorghum. "But on one occasion I went too far.

POWER OF THE WORD: For the word of God is quick, arid powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword-, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and mar row, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Hebreivs 4: 12.. TEXT OF PRESIDENTS MESSAGE (Continued From Page 1) expressed purpose of the Jones act. Only one conclusion has been pos sible. Frankly, members of house and senate, eager as I am to join you in the making of an American mer chant marine commensurate with our commerce, the denouncement of our comercial treaties would involve us in & chaos of trade relationships and add indescribably to the confusion of the already disordered commercial world. Our power to d6 so Is not disputed, but power and ships, with out comity of relationship, will not give us the expanded trade which is inseparably linked with a great mer chant marine. Moreover, the applied reduction of duty, for yhich the treaty .denouncements were neces sary, encouraged only the carrying of dutiable imports to our shores, while the tonnage which unfurls the flag on the seas is both free and dutiable, and the cargoes which make a nation eminent In trade are outgoing, rather than incoming. "It is not my thought to lay the problem In detail before you today. It is desired nly to say to you that the executive branch of the gov ernment, uninfluenced by the pro test of any nation, for none has been made, is well convinced that your proposal highly intended and heartily supported here, is so fraught with difficulties and so marked by tend encies to discourage trade expansion that I invite your tolerance of non compliance for a very few weeks until a plan may be presented which contemplates no greater draft upon the particular treasury, and which, though yet too crude to offer It to rlu'. fives such promise of expand ing our merchant marine that It will argue its own approval. It is enougu to sav today thtt we are so pos sessed Of ships and the American In tention to establish a merchant ma rine is so unalterable that a plan of reimbursement, at no other cost than is contemplated in the existing act, will anneal to the pride and encour. age the hope of all the American people. 

TARIFF REVISION 'There is before you the comple tion of the enactment of what has been termed e "permanent' tariff law. the word 'permanent' being used to distinguish it from the emergency act which the congress expedited early In the extraordinary session and which is the law today. I cannot too strongly urge an early completion of this necessary legislation. It is needed to stabilize our industry at home; it is essential to make more definite our trade relations abroad. More, it is vital to the preservation of many of our own industries which contribute so notably to the very life blood of our nation. "There is now, and there always will be. a storm of conflicting opin ion about any tariff revision. We cannot go far wrong when we base our tariffs on the policy of preserv ing the productive activities, which enhance employment and add to our national prosperity. "Again comes the reminder that we must not be unmindful of the world conditions, that peoples are struggling for industrial rehabilita tion, and that we cannot dwell In In dustrial and commercial exclusion and at the same time do the just thing In aiding world recognition and readjustment. We do not seek a self ish aloofness and we could not prof It by it were it possible. We recog nize the necessity of buying wherever we sell, and the permanence of trade lies in Its acceptable exchanges. In our pursuit o. markets we must give as well as receive. We cannot sell to others who do not produce, nor can we buy unless we produce at home. Sensible of evei? obligation of hu manity, commerce and finance, link ed as they are in the present world condition, it is not to be argued that we need destroy ourselves to be help ful to others. With all my heart. I wish restoration to the peoples blighted by the awful world war, but the process of restoration does not He in our acceptance of like condi tions. It were better to remain on firm ground, strive for ample em ployment and high standards ot wages at home, and point the way to balanced budpets. rifrid economy and resolute efficient work as the neces sary remedies to cure disaster. 

TRADE EXPANSION "Everything relating to trade among ourselves and among nations has been expanded, excessive, inflat ed, abnorma and thpre is a madness in finance which no American policy . alone can cure. We are a creditor nation, not ty normal processes, but made so by war. It is not an un worthy selfishness to seek to save ourselves wnen the processes of that salvation are not only denied to oth ers, but commended to them. We seek to undermine for others no in dustry by which they subsist; we are obliged to permit the undermining of none of our own which make for employment and maintained activities. '"Every contemplation, it little mat tors in which direction one turns. magnifies the difficulty of tariff legis lation, but the necessity of the re vision is magnified with it. Doubt less we are justified in seeking a more flexible policy than we have provided heretofore. I hope a way will be found to make for flexibility and elasticity sd that ras may be adjusted to' meet unusual nd chang ing conditions, which cannot be ac curately anticipated, here are prob lems incident to unfair practices and to exchanges which madness in money nave made almost unsolvable. I know of no manner in which to effect this flexibility other than the extension of the powers of the tariff commis sion, so that It can adapt itself to a scientific and wholly just adminis tration of the la r. FLEXIBLE TARIFF "I am not unmindful of the con stitutional difficulties. These can be met by giving authority to the chief executive who could proclaim-additional duties to meet conditions which the congress may designate. v "At this point I must disavow any desire to enlarge the executive's pow ers or add to the responsibilities of the office. Tbey are already too large. If there were any other plan I would prefer it. "The grant of authority to proclaim would necessarily bring the tariff commission new and enlarged activi ties because no executive could dis charge such a duty except upon the Information acquired and recommen dations by this commission. But the plan is feasible and the proper functioning of the board would give us a better administration of a de fined policy than ever can be made possible by tariff duties prescribed without flexibility. American Valuation "There is a manifest difference Of opinion about the American valua tion. Many nations have adopted delivery valuation as the basis for collecting duties that is, they take the cost of the imports delivered at the port of entry as tho basis for levying duty. It is no radical de parture, in view of the varying con ditions and the disordered state of money values, to provide for Ameri can valuation, but there can not be Ignored the danger of such a valua tion brought to the level of our own production costs, making our tariffs prohibitive. It might do so In many instances where imports ought to be encouraged. I believe congress ought well to consider the desirabil ity of the only promising alternative, namely, a provision authorizing pro claimed American valuation, under prescribed conditions, on any given list of articles imported. "In this proposed flexibility, auth orizing increases to meet conditions o likely to change, there should also be provision for decreases. A rate may be just today, and entirely out of proportion six months from todRy. If our tariffs ' are to be made equitable, and not necessarily bur den our imports and hinder our trade abroad, frequent sdjustment will be necessary for years to come. Knowing the impossibility of modifi cation by act of congress for anyone or a score of lines without involv ing a long array of schedules. I think we shall go a long ways toward stab ilization, if there is recognition of the tariff commission's fitness to recommend urgent changes by proc lamation. Business Revival "I am sure about Public opinion favoring the early determination of our tariff policy. There have been reassuring slgDs of a business re vival from the deep slump which all the world has been experiencing. Our unemployment, which gave us deep concern, only a few weeks ago. has grown encouragingly less and new assurances and renewed confi dence will attend the congressional declaration that American Industry will be held secure. "Much has been said about the protective policy for ourselves mak ing it impossible for our debtors to (lischorge their obligations to us. Tliis is a contention not. now press ing for decision. If we must choose hetween a people in Idleness press ing fur the payment of indebtedness, or a people resuming the normal wys of employment and carrying the credit, let us choose the . latter. Sometimes we appraise largest the human ill most vivid in our minds We have been giving, and are gtv ing now, of our influence and ap peals to minimize the likelihood of war and throw off the crurng bur- deos of armaments. It is all very earnest, with a national soul impell ing. But a people unemployed and gaunt with hunger, face a situation quite as disheartening as war and our greater obligation today is to do the government's part toward resunv ing productivity and promoting for tunate and remunerative employ' merit.. Agricultural Relief "Something more than tariff pro tection is required by American agrl culture. To the farm has come the earlier and the heavier burdens of readjustment. There is actual de pression in our agricultural industry, while agricultural prosperity is ab solutely essential to the general pros- peruy ot ine country. "Congress has sought very earnest ly to provide relief. It has promptly given such temporary relief as has been rossible, but the call is insist ent for the permanent solution. It is inevitable that large crops lower the prices and short crops advance them. Xo legislation can cure that funda mental law. But there must be some economic solution for the excessive variation in returns for agricultural production . "It is rather shocking to be told and to have the statement strongly supported, that 9,000.0o0 bales of cot ton, raised on American plantations in a given year, actually will be worth more to the producers than 1 J. 000.000 bales would have been. Equally shocking is the statement that 700,000.000 bushels of wheat, raised by American fanners would bring them more money than a bil lion bushels. Yet these are not ex aggraled statements.; In a world where there are tens of millions who need food and clothing, which they cannot get, such a condition is sure to indict the social system which makes It possible. Co-operative Marketing "In the main the remedy lies in distribution and marketing. Every proper encouragement should be given to the co-operative marketing programs. These have proven very helpful to the co-operating communi ties in Europe. In Russia the co operative community has become a recognized bulwark of law and order, and saved individualism from engulf ment in social paralysis. Ultimately they will be accredited with the sal vation of the Russian state. "There is the appeal for this ex periment. Why not try it? None challenges the right of the farmer to a larger share of the consumers' pay for his product, no one can dis pute that we cannot live without the farmer. He is justified in rebelling against the transportation cost. Given a fair return for his labor, he will have less occasion to appeal for financial aid; and given assurance that .his labors shall not be in vain, we assure all the people of a produc tion sufficient to meet our national requirement and guard against dis aster. Back to Farm Movement "The base of the pyramid of civ ilization which rests upon the soli is shrinking through the drift of pop ulation from farm to city. For a generation we have been expressing more or less concern about this ten dency. Economists have warned and statesmen have deplored. We thought for a time that modern conveniences and the more intimate contact would halt the movement.- but it has gone steadily on. Perhaps only grim necessity will correct it but we ought to find a less drastic remedy. "The existing scheme of adjusting freight rates has been favoring the basing points, until industries are attracted to some centers and re pelled from others. A great volume of uneconomic and wasteful trans portation has attended and the costs increased accordingly. The grain milling and meat packing industries afford ample illustration, and the attending concentration is readily apparent. The menaces in concen tration are not limited to the re tarding influences on agriculture. Manifestly the conditions and terms of railway transportation ought not be permitted to increase the unde sirable tendency. Transportation Problem "We have a Just pride in our great cities, but we shall find a greater pride in the nation which has a larger distribution of its population into the country, whore comparative ly self-sufficient smaller communi ties may blend agricultural and man ufacturing interests in harmonious helpfulness and enhanced good for tune. Such a movement contem plates no tlestriirtion of tliiii.es WIUUKill, of lUii.aLLLli.UU uu.de, ul wealth Involved. It only looks to ai general policy of transportation, of distributed Industry, and of highway ! construction, to encourage the epread ot our population and restore the proper balance between city and ' country. The problem may well have your earnest attention. "It has been perhaps the proudest claim of our American civilization that in dealing with human rela tionships it has constantly .moved toward such justice in distributing the product of human energy that it has improved continuously the eco nomical status of the mass of peo ple. Ours has been a highly pro ductive social organization. On the way up from the elemental stages of society we have eliminated slavery and serfdom and are now far on the way to the elimination of poverty. Labor Problem "Through the eradication of il literacy, and the diffusion of educa tion, mankind has reached a stage where we may fairly say that in the United States equality of oppor tunity has been attained, though all are not prepared to embrace it. There Is, indeed, a too great diver gence between the economic condi tions of the most and the least fa vored classes in the community. But even that divergence has now come to the point where we bracket the very poor and the very rich to gether as the least fortunate classes. Our efforts may well be directed to Improving the status of both. "While this Wit of problems is commonly apprehended under the general phrase 'capital and labor. it is really justly broader. It is a ques tion of social economic organization. Labor has become a large contrib utor, through its savings, to the stock of capital; while the people who own the lareest individual aggregates of capital are themselves often hard and earnest laborers, very onen it Is extremely difficult to draw the line of demarcation between the two groups; to determine whether a par ticular individual is entitled to be set down as laborer or as capitalist. In a very, large proportion of cases he is both, and when he is botn, he i the most useful citizen. Industrial Tribunal "The right of labor to organize is just as fundamental and necessary as is the right of capital to organize. The riKht of labor to negotiate, to deal with and solve its particular problems, in an organized way, through its chosen agents, is Just as essential as is the right of capital to organize, to maintain corporations, to limit the liabilities of stockholders. Indeed, we have come to realize that the limited liability of the citizen as a member of a labor organization closely parallels the limitation of lia bility of the citizen as a stockholder in a corporation for profit. Along this line of reasoning we shall make the greatest progress toward solution ot our problem of capital and labor. "In the case of the corporation which enjoys the privilege of limited liability of stockholders, particularly when engaged In the public service, it la recoe nixed that the outside pub lic has a large concern which must be protected: and so we provide reg ulations, restrictions, and some cases detailed supervision. Likewise in the case of labor organization we might well a only similar and equally well defined principles of regulation and supervision in order to conserve the public's Interests as affected by their , operations. REGULATION OF UNIONS "Just as it is not desirable that a corporation shall be allowed to im pose undue exactions upon the pub lic so it is not desirable that a labor organization shall be permitted to exact unfair terms of employment or subject the public to actual dis tresses in order to enforce its terms. Finally Just as we are earnestly seeking for procedures whereby to adjust and settle political differences between nations without resort to war. so we may well look about for means to settle tne oiiterences oe tween organized capital and organ ized labor without resort to those forms of warfare which we recog nize under the names of strikes, lockouts, hoveott and the like. ENFORCED MEDIATION "As we have great bodies of law carefully Tegulating the organiza tion and operations of industrial and financial corporations, as we have treaties and compacts among na tions which look to the settlement of differences without the necessity of conflict in arms, so we might w-ell have plans of conference, of common counsel, of mediation, arbitration and judicial determination in controver sies between labor and capital. To accomplish this would involve the necessity to develop a thorough-going code of practice in dealing with such affairs.. It might well frankly to set forth the superior interest of the community as a whole to either the labor group or the capital group. With rights, privileges, immuniUes and modes of organizations thus carefully defined, it should be pos sible to Bet up judicial or quasi Ju dicial tribunals for the consideration and d. germination of all disputes which menace the public welfare. "In an industrial society such as ours, the strike, the lockout and the boycott are as much out of place and as disastrous in their results as is war or armed revolution In the do main of politics. The same disposi tion to reasonableness to concilia tion, to recognition of the other side's point of view, the same provision of fair and recognized tribunals and processes, ought to make it possible to solve the one set of questions as easy as the other. 1 believe solu tion is possible. "The consideration of such a policy would necessitate the exercise of care, of deliberation In the construc tion of a code and a charter of ele mental rights, dealing with the rela tions of employer and employe. This foundation in the law, dealing with the modern conditions of social and economic life would hasten the building of the temple of peace in Industry which a rejoicing nation would acclaim. REWARD EX-SERVICE MEN "After each war, until the last, the government has been enabled to give homes to its returned soldiers and a large part of our settlement and de velopment has attended this gener our provision of land for the nation's defenders. RECLAMATION PROJECTS "There is yet unreserved ap proximately 200,000,000 acres in the public domain, 20,000,000 acres of which are known to be susceptible of reclamation and made fit for homes by provision for irrigation. , "The government has been as sisting in the development of its remaining lands, until the esti mated increase in land values in the irrigated sections is fully $500,000,000 and the crops ef 1920 alone on these lands ar estimated to exceed $100,000,000. "Undar the law ajthonzmg these expenditures for develop ment, the advances are to be re turned and it would be good busi ness for the government to pro vide for the reclamation of the remaining 20,000,000 acres, in ad dition to expediting the comple tion of projects long under way. COAL AND GAS LEASES "Under what Is known as the coal and gas lease law, applicable also to deposits of phosphates and other - minerals on the public domain, leases are now being made on the royalty basis, and are producing large rev enues to the government. Under this legislation, 10 per centum of all roy alties is to be paid directly to the fed eral treasury and of the remainder 50 per centum is to be used for reclamation of arid lands by irrlga- . tion and 40 per centum is to be paid to the states in which the operations are located, to be used by them for school and road purposes. " inese resources are so vast and the development is affording so rer liable a basis of estimate that the interior department expresses the be lief that ultimately the present law will add in royalties and payments to the treasuries of the federal gov ernment and the states containing these public lands a total of 112, 000,000.000. This means, of course, an added wealth of many times that sum. 'these prospects seem to af ford every Justification of govern ment advances in reclamation and irrigation. t
