Entered at the Postottice at Cottonwood, Idaho, for ransportation through the mail as second class matter Subscription one year .............. fl.50 Six Months ........................ 1.00 FRIDAY, DEC. 8, 1905. Owing to unavoidable delay we are not able to make the change in the Chronicle we hoped to thiB week but will make it next week without fail. An Anti-Mustache and Whisker club has been organized at Weiser and Borne painful sights are to lie seen since some of the fellows have abbreviated their hirsute adorn ment. President Roosevelt has issued his message to congress hut it is such a lengthy article that lack of space prevents us from publishing it. The message, however, is char acteristic of the man and is one of the best issued in recent vears. If you toot your little tooter And then lay aside your horn, In ten short days there's not a soul Will know that you were horn; The man who gathers pumpkins is The man who plows all day, And the man who keeps a-humping is The man who makes it pay. While the announcement of the letting of the contract for the con struction of the Northern Pacific line across the prairie has not been made it is expected daily and will be the signal for the commence ment of great activity in all lines in this country. It is doubtful if the labor supply will equal the demand. If a couple more tracts of land in and around Cottonwood could be purchased by some enterprising people who would put them on the market at reasonable prices we could expect to see the town take a start next spring and develop a growth that would astonish the old settleis. Right prices and a little boosting is all that is needed. The way President Roosevelt is bringing to light the grafters and dishonest government servants re minds one of Rider Haggard,s African tale where the Zulu king. Chaka, had his doctors "smell out" the witches, except that Chaka had the heads cut off of those he disliked while the president severs the official heads from those who have not performed their duties properly. Late reports state that engineers of three or four different railroads are now fighting to secure the Lo Lo pass which certainly means one or more transcontinental lines be ing built through central Idaho within the next couple years. And every indication points to the Harriman people extending their line from the south to connect with the joint line on the prairie. Evidently Idaho is to be the scene of great railroad activity in the near future. Our readers are requested to read the different advertisments in this paper each week.
