It is hardly necessary to Hay that the President's Message was published yesterday evening from the Intjslliukncer office several hours ahead of all competition. In fact up to the latest advices it had not made its ap~ pearance froin any other quarter. The l*realdent'M MmuifCP. We surrender most of our available space this morning to the Message. li was issued yesterday evening irom our office iu the shape of an extra, and was eagerly aought after l?y the reading public. There was an intense anxiety to see what position the President had tttkeu in reference to Congress. "We thiuk wo can say that the gen eral expectation was agreeably disappointed in the tone of the document. While few expected Mr. Johson to bo conciliatory and compromising as regards his policy, yet inany persons feared that he would rashly attempt to arraign Congress and provoke retaliation on the part of that body. While the Presideut re-asserts his "policy/* and is more than ever confirmed as to its salutary and saving benefits, yet he takes evident care to avoid the coarse, vituperative and disgraceful language of his campaign speeches last September, and to place himself strictly on the defensive. Iu this respect his message contains nothing new,and noone will be edified by the arguments put forth. Mr. Johnson, while seemingly firm in bis former opinions, has been verv per-, ceptibly modified in his mail nor, and we doubt not realize* that liis position iu not of thut sort before Cougress and the country to warrant him in any assumptions ot Htyle. We need not attempt to point out his careful avoidance of tho real issue before the people in the late elections. That omission will Htrike the reader at once. lie ignores the elections altogether. He does not even refer to them in tho remotest degree. He simply leaves with Congress, as he affected to do this time lusL year, the responsibility of effecting a full settlement with the rebel States. This is a gratuity on the part of the President that is cheap enough in view of all that he has said iu the hearing of tho public within tho last few mouths, and will be taken at its proper discount. lie can rest assured that Congress will assume tho responsibility which he thus with so much would-be concession, turns over to their keeping. No one would gather from tho message that there was any unusual cause for the course pursued by Congress toward the South. Tho drift of all the President Hays is to make it appear that it is merely a wanton exercise of partisan power,?dangerous because needless, to refuse representation to the lato insurrectionary States, lie quotes the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and also extracts front the State papers of Washington, Jefferson and JackHon. The common sense of tlio country will ask what have all these citations to do with the anomalous and unprecedented facts of our situatiou. All that is quoted has no hearing whatever upon tlio great difficulty that confronts us. We are dealing with a rebellion, and with rebel* who have not only forfeited tbat representation " upon which Mr. Johnson lays so much stress,but, in addition, life aud projierty. The repre m-iiuiiitcn ui iiiu |>i-ii|iii< ill i uu^n-NN lutvt* foregone all desire, anil all their plainly established right, to enforce against the authors and principal participators In the rebellion the extreme peualties of the law, and have manifested ouly an anxiety to secure tin* nation, the whole people, the North as well as the South, against the possible revivification of the rebellion iu any aliape whatever. Mr. John It. Baldwin, himself n leading rebel, not long ago, in a published letter, vindicated the full, unquestioned and prescriptive right of the Government to exact all tlio {penalties of treason, while doubting and combatting the expediency of ho doing. And yet tlio President of the ITuited States, the man who was elected upon the strength of hi* frequent, persistent and, if we may so call them, ultra declarations in favor of the fullest exactions and enforcement of those peualties,stauds forth to-day iu flagrant disregard of all his ulLterauces, and arraigns Congress and the country as the uctual persecutor* of the people of the South. This is the President's position, stripped of all verbiage and all disguise. He means, if he means anything, that therebels lost none of their franchises by their rebelliou, but that, on the contrary, their position is equal iu the sight of the C-onstitution to that of those who defoated their rebelliou aud pre served tho Government from destruction. There is no escape from this construction of Ills whole argument. It needs simply to bo thus plainly stated to see how self-stultifying and selfdegrading is tho position of tho President. It will lie.noticed that Mr. Johnson puts in a claim for the accustomed representation of the South in both nouses of Congress. Three-iifths of the negroes are still the basis of his estimate as to what is due the rebels. He takes no account ot the fact that we have no ?laves lu this country any more. Neither does he take any account of the gross and manifest injustice of counting the former slave* of the South in tho basis of representation merely to give increased political power to their late owners. On the Fenian questiou Mr. Johnson'e position is one of evident embarrass^ went, the great problem being how not to say anything offensive to tho Fenians and yet not violate the obligations of the Government in the matter of the Neutrality laws. It Is a mere venal offense, it would seem, to tit out expeditions agalust a foreign power from our borders, and not a heinous international crime. Even the responsibility for what was done last summer to preveut the Canada lnvasiou is thrown upon the fact that Neutrality laws were upon the national statute books, and had tc be executed, however unwilling the Executive may have been to do so, I We submit that such an evasion of the high independence that ought to attach to the head of the Government is a pitiful come off. It is not for the Chiei Magistrate of a nation that has recently passed through the terrible ordeal of a rebellion, to frame hesitating excuses to the world on behalf of u movement against law and order abroad, and against the peace and dignity of our own Government. Bat we have not apace to discuss the message in extenso. It wDl be generally read by all who will read these remarks. Wfe have pointed out only the salient points with a view of drawing attention to the sophistical undertone that characterizes the document in one or two very essential particulars. The exhibit that is given of the affairs ol the Treasury, the War Department, and the Postoffice, is highly encouraging. We shall defer comment upon these items ot the message until anotliei time. Tkmpkranck and vinks.?The California Statu Temperance Convention recently met in San Francisco and denounced the rapidly increasing culture of viiH*s in that State. The Evening Bulletin criticises this action as follows: "It was a mistake in the Temperance Convention to aim a blow at one of the great industries of the State. Although it will he useless to petition Congress to break down the wine manufacture in California by onerous and partial taxes, the circulation and advocacy of such |H*titioiiM, as proposed, will excite angry critiiMMiii and substitute mere clamor and discussion for the efTeetivo reformatory labor in which hitherto the temperance apostles of California have been honorably engaged. Wine-making cannot be prevented from becoming a leading industry here. The wonderful adaptability of our soil und climate to the business, and the wide market which is anorueu at nome ami aoroau, will cause tin? value of this product to rank at least equal Willi that of the gold product. If prohibitory laws could totally stop wine-drinking in outown State, the foreign demand alone would even now prevent any cessation in production; and liercalter the foreign demand is to be the great dependence of our wine-growers. The prohibitionists would therefore be obliged to liud some means of preventing exportation, if they still desired to prevent winemakiug in California; and in the quest of such means they would come upon the immovable obstacle ot federal commercial law. Jience it was simply idle for the convention to talk of discouraging wine-growing in California." * Thk Paymaster General is in daily receipt of from 4,000 to 5,000 applicants for the new bounty under the act of July 28,180G, and it is not unlikely that payment in some cases will commence before a great while. Owing to the large number of claims already recoiv ed, it is probable that xnany of the samo company and regiment are on tile, which will facilitate the necessary searches; for, while examining the roll for one claim, it is desirable to complete the roll by adjusting all the claims which will likely arise from that roll. For these reasons soldiers are advised to forward their claims as rapidly as possible, lor the sooner they are in, the sooner payment will commence. Care should be taken, however, to see that the ciises are correct before forwarding. On the discharge of a regular soldier in the hands of the department, the names of 51 battles and skirmishes are noted as having been participated in by the owner. X A H II Y .

CONPBDRRIT X KOADS, ^ (wich is in tlieStait uv Kentucky,) > November liii, ISiMi. J The papers uv the country are very generally discussin the question: *\Shel the Democratic party live or die," wich when we take into considerashen the fact that the corpse is ufore us, seems to me holler mockery, and a heartless tritlin with the feelins uv the friends uv the deceast. Ther aint no yooseuv tnlkin uv its fucher, coz its in it* fucher now, ami a tomb stun mite ez well be put up, regard lis uv expense, comuiemmoratiu its virchoos. The Chicago Times aud various other papers are advocalin the ijee uv iloppin over to nigger suffrage, i liev let my Websterian intellek lite onto this subjek at various times, ami the more I hev considered it, the more 1 am satisfied that it wont do. A naber of mine wunst hed the stuuiick-ake, aud applied to me for a remedy. In a spirit uv jockelarity I told him that striknine wood euro that, ez well ez all other physicle ills. The poor fellow not seein it wuz a joke, took an ounce or two, and need 1 state the result? He sleeps in the valley. Nigger suffrage, wich is rank pizcu, wood end the troubles uv the lHtnocrisy, but woodeu't it end Dimocriwy also? We mite die gracefully ez Dimocrats, but wood our resurrection ez Abolitionists be certain 1 Woodeu't the people when wo an wunst entombed, forget to awaken usl iuy oujecuons are luese; 1. Wo can't gobbleAbllshen votes with niggur KUtl'raKt1, for the reason that el the people desire it they'd probably gc to tht* inventors thereof, that they might bo ashaoml uv get tin the genooine article. 2.

Atore that time I shel hov gono into that other world wher pollytix wonl trouble me, and ef the orthodox relijus beleofs uv the day is correct, in the department uv the totlier world iu wich 1 shell pull up, there will bo a strong Democratic majority. Kz. I lilt up my eyes from thence, it will do me no pertikelergood, ez 1 kuow uv, to be told that the Dimocrisy hev elected ther President by nigger votes?that intelligence woodn't supply the place uv the water I shood be eallln for.

How will it stand, theu? We hev teu States out, wich we kin depend upou. Kentucky, Delaware and Maryland make thirteen, aud Mexico kin be cut up into twenty more, or thirty for thai matter, givin us a clean majority in the Senit, House and Electoral College. 1 hev let my iutellek out onto this subjeck aud aiu't mistaken.

Thirty States ; turned over to us with a people wich coodn't compete with us for the offisi^. My solo expands with the thot. The field wood be u rich one for Androo Jazon Rogers to stump, for the peeple, not understandin a word uv wat he wuz asay in and hevin a high opinion uv the Amerikins, wood think he wuz talkin sence! And His eggslency, the President! wat a i chance it wood be for him! He cood ; hev Duglis dug up and re-buried at t Monterey, so ez ho cood hev a excoose for making a tour to his tomb, or, ef 1 the friends uy the statesman objected to ! that, he cood go to Chicago by way uv f the City uv Mexico, and cood make his , speech at the way stations through that 1 country without fear. The Mexikins . wood reseeve the constooshnns and stars i gladly, and ez they don't understand . the language they woodeut reseeve his speech with peels of lal'iure es they did on his late memorable toor thro Noo York, Ohio, Michigan, Illinoy, et settry, the remembrance of wich, even at this day, sends a thrill uv anguish thro the Presidenshel breast wich even the , triumph in Delaware and Maryland cannot and does not soothe. The people of the North wood receeve the proposishen gladly. I menshund , the matter to a Ieadin merchant uv Philadelphia, who had just declined to give six months credit for a small stock uv goods to a friend uv mine, on my endorsement, but who in the most ungentletnauly manner expressed a willingness tosell for cash, and he warmly approved uvit. "Go," sed he, "and ef it will work ez yoo say and take them incubuBses out uv this country, 1 think I kin not only promise yoo the co-operasheu uv the people uv the North, but also money enuir to pay yoor fares to the land uv yoor choice." And he bust into teers. "Wat are yoo weepin for?" sed I, astonished. "Those teers,"sed ho,"are for Mexico." "She hez endoored much, but her cup uv woe is not yet full." This is the only hope uv the Democrisy. The people hev bin brought face to face with slavery, and they smaslit it. They hev bin brought face to face with nigger equality, and they don't scare at it at all. They wuz brought up before Southern sooperiority, and they puuetoored that. They *u?uv-i CAinioitc HI" 13 III IU tbe South, and somehow they come home with sin^ler ideas, and wondered that they hed bin rooledHO long by sich emptiness. The Booth speculashen didn't day, for tho we shot Lin ken we cooilent shoot Linken's principles and they remain to torcher us. When he fell, others, somehow, steptforrard and took up tbe ark, and they hev bin oarryin it rite along. Johnson interposed the post oflis, but they kicked em aside contemptously. Only by addishun kin wo hope in the fuelier to rool. Tho sole uv John Brown is marchin 011, and ez far ez I kin see, our plan is let it march and git out uv its way. Petroleum V. Xasby, P.

I was suffering from a violent cough, for which I had been treated during six months previously without benefit, 1 had Night-Sweats which comf>letely prostrated me. In the evening. loarseuess would come on, which would prevent nie from speaking above a whisper. I had then had two attacks of bleeding from the lung*. My family Physician assured me that lie could do no more for me. I was growing rapidly worse, and had been compelled to leave business for nearly two months. All my symptoms indicated, unmistakably,the presence of CON SUM PTION; In the lK-ginnlng of February, Mr. Henry Fisher, Treasurer of the American Bible Society, presented me with a bottle of the PREPARED PRESCRIPTION. In a few days, my appetite, (which I had entirely lost.) returned; within a week, my cou^h had almost left me: and in les* th?n ?uv. Night Sweats wore broken up. Thenceforward I regained strength, and am now regularly attending to my duties an clerk to the AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY, in whose employment I have been nine years. I am now enjoying good health. Your PRESCRIPTION effected a CURE, when my friends despaired of my recovery. THOtt. J. CONGER. "I have had N ervous or Spasmodic Asthma for eleven yean;. During the last six years I have never had an uninterrupted night's rest. It often seemed to me that I would die before I could get air into my lungs. I suffered to greatly from 'Mliortuess ot breath,' that I was compiled to take frequent rests In walking from my residence to my place of buslnes . "The night before I obtained the 'PREPARED PRESCRIPTION,'was the worst I ever passed. On obtaining the remedy, I took a teaspoonful at noon and again at night, and slept all night without waking. I have not ha d a broken night's rest since * ? o o I have now completely recovered my strength and spirits, and am not at all afflicted with 'shortness of breath.'
