ANOTHER REMONSTRANCE. Hearing on El? Dagnias' License Ap plication Again Deferred. Another ' delay in the disposition of Eli Dangenlas' application for a license to do a liquor business in the Boflo building at No. 6 union street came about Mondav morttinnf r4i. a Vintt 'conference between the county com missioners and counsel In the case. Commissioners J. A. Dady, B. H. Corttis and Urgele Ixifrance eat for a hearing in the office of thn selectmen in the town hall building at 10.80 o'clock. Attorneys Harry E. Back and Arthur Q. Bill wore in attendance to represent interests opposed to Mr. Dagenias having a license. Attorney Charles L. Torrey, Putnam, appeared as counsel for the applicant. A first hitch in the proceedings de veloped when Mr. Back gave notice that he desired to file a new remon strance. This move was objected to by Mr. Torrey, on the ground that it wa stoo late for such action, as the present hearing was on a remonstrance previously filed. Mr. Back, who, with Michael Longo, had signed the new remonstrance, con tended that a citizen and a taxpaper have the right to flle a remonstrance in such cases at any time durincr tlhe proceedings. Commissioner Corttis hesitated, aa did the other members, of the commission, over deciding apolnt that had not previously come up at such a hearing, so after more discus sion it was decided to pontpone the hearing until nex Saturday morning at 8 o'clock when it will be he'd in Put nam, for the great convenience of the majority of the persons converned. In relation to the new remonstrance Mfr. Back stated that It was signed by Michael Iongo, son of Mrs. Annie Longo, wfhose signature by Itself, ap pears on the original remonstrance, and by Mr. Back himself. Mr. Lon go is a citizen and a voter !n KTIHng iy, Mr. Back being the same and a taxpayer an well. Monday's hearing was to have de veloped whether Mrs. Longo, who la not a citizen, had a right to remon strate. This point also will be threshed out at Saturday morning's hearing, but Mr. Back indicated there might be an appeal to the superior court on the point at issue, this, of course, depending on circumstances. License Transferred. While sitting here Monday, the com missioners transferred the license at the Daniel son inn from C. H. Michaels to A. D. Wentworth, who recently pur chased the business. Setting 8narea For Foxes. The miserable practice of setting snares for foxes, contrary to law, is again being practiced in the town of urooktyn, in what is known as the Bailey woods section. Gurdon E. Withey reported Monday that while out hunting foxes, a com panion, while traversing a narrow path through the woods, had his foot caught in a wire rox snare and was thrown headlong to the irround. The four- ply copper wire, fitted as a noose, that had caught around his ankle had so tightened that it was removed with difficulty: Fox hunters who follow the sport In what is considered the legitimate manner are bitterly opposed to the snaring practice, which Is apt to net a valuable hunting dog for a prize as it is a fox. Numbers of fine, well trained dogs have been strangled to death, dying in agony, as the result of being caught in snarea, the setting of which is in vio lation of the law and the call of the sportsmen is for the game protectors to get busy.

Bartlett and Mips Rosa mond Danielson will be in Hartford tomorrow for a meeting of the execu tive board of 'the Connecticut Wom an's Suffrage association: The first full meeting sines the state annual convention at Jew Ha ven in Nocember. The officers will be able to make a good showing in re fold to work already begun, and plans will be discussed for work to be un dertaken when the session of the leg islature begins. The suffragists . are strongly hoping that th? legislature will show Itself . more favorable to measures dcslredby the women than was the legislature elected in 1914. The bills to be pushed by the C. W. S. A. as an organization will all be meas ures enlarging the voting rights of women, but Individual suffragists are also deeply Interested in a number of other measures, especially the bill for the establishment of a reformatory for women, the' bill shortening- the working hours of woman and girls, the bill for mothors' pension a meas ure which has been massed by every one of the equal suffrag-e states and by nearly twenty of the mr.n-suffrage states, and a bill raising the age -of consent to eighteen years. The new leagues that ha-e been organised within the last few weeks are showing a surprising dojree of life and vigor. They are mostly small leagues because they aro in very small communities. One of them the Falls Village Bcjual Suffrage League on".y came into existence a few weeks be fore the state suffrago convention in New Haven last month. Nevtrehsless it Is planning to hold a food sale to raise money to pay Its pledge to the state and to conduct a membership campaign to add to the number of its onrolled members. Even in the small community in which it is established it has already enrolled 85 men and women as believers in equal suffrage, and it is expecting to add all the re maining members of the adult popu lation to Its enrollment before many weeks have passed. Tho Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association has no connection with the suffragists who unfurled a banner in the house of representatives at Washington when President Wilson was reading his annual message. The banner bore the legend "President Wilson, what do you . intend ' to do about woman suffrage?" The . women who were responsible were not mem bers of tho National Association to which the Connecticut Woman Suf frage Association belongs. The Na tional Association has always care fully avoided even the slightest ap pearance of militancy in its tactics, and is now busily engaged in making friends for the cause in both political parties, , here for burial in St. Mary's seme tery.
