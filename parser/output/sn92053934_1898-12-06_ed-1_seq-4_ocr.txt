As a condensed history of the war President McKinley's document is in teresting and creditable. Willis Hasklwwd retire! from the county clerkship of Adams county yesterday, after a service of a quarter of a century. Mr. Haselwood was banqueted in (Juincy last night. Congress is already face to with the duty of investigating conduct of the war as far as face the the proer department is concerned. What steps will be taken with reference to the matter referred yesterday remains to oe seen. Conjiiei;in; the apparent fixed policy of the government of the United Mates in favor of territorial ex pan sion leyoim the seas, there are two recommendations in the president's message to heartily commend the earlv completion of the Nicaragua canal and the appropriation of suOi cient funds for .0 new battleships. The Madrid papers take a gloom v view of the outcome of the Paris cod ference. A day or so ago they pub lished long articles sadlv reminding the country that "the day is one Ion to le remembered as marking the closing scene of a glorious colonial ' history.
