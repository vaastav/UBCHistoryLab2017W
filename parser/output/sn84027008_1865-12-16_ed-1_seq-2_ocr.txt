COLUMBIA. Saturday Morning, Dec. 16. 1865. More Signs. Wc published on Thursday some indica? tions from Congress, that the radicals, on ?)bcr second thought, were cooling off from their intemperate action on thu first two days of the session. Wv: have further favor? able indications in our Northern exchanges received Thursday. Mr. Forney, writing Trom Washington, to his piper, the Phila? delphia Press, says " there is a conscious ?nd visible improvement in the political prospect this fine winier morning," De? cember 0. "Many things will conspire to increase and extend this feeling. First tornes th? happy accord between tho -President and Congress, if not as to all .ibo remedies, at least in the absolute duty and necessity of a permanent adjustment of national equalities. But equal even to 'Mun essential clement of future peace and hartr.r.nw is the good temper among tho heretofore -complaining Southerners. Tho determination of Congress and tho ?ihoroughness of tho President havo evi? dently convinced them that their only truo vcourse is to agree to all the enumerated conditions." Again we lind the following in the open? ing paragraph of a long editorial article in ?the"Now York Tribune, reviewing tho Presi? dent's Message: ""No document discussing so many diverse questions of grave moment and seriously affecting so many vital in? terests as the first annual message of President Johnson, could reasonably be -expected to accord ia every respect with .ino convictions or prepossessions of a majority of its readers; yet we doubt .whether any former message has, on tho "whole, contained so much that wiil bo ?generally and justly approved, with so little that will or should provoke dissent, lt is a State naper of signal ability and of ??unusual frankness, dealing unreservedly -with every great question of internal or international policy, and calculated to in? crease the hold of its author on tho regard and confidence of the American people." -This from such a radical as Greeley, is ?oert???ly remarkable. Throughout his comments, he is highly commendatory of <the President's views, dissenting only to ?ais views on tho negro suffrage question' .?.?ndeven on that point, he is not disposed to ""chop logic." There are other significant items in tho Washington items, publish? ed elsewhere in yesterday's paper. Above -all, the despatch from thc President to Go werfior Perry, which we published on Wed? nesday, gives us groat encourageai ont to ?hope that Stevens, Sumner and their Ifangs of ultra radical followers will quail /ajid give way before thc statesman-like views of the President and the conserva? tives in Congress. So mote it he ! -e 4 ? > Tiie New York Herald's Washington cor? respondent states that the adjournment cf Ojugrcss until Monday has given the mein f.'ters an opportunity of visiting the depart ?merrte, which few appear to have omitted. 'Iii? Comptroller of Currency has been literally besieged. A majority of dose srho honor him with a cal! are interested in the establishment of National Banks, or th? naming of some as depositors. Judg? ing from the temper and inclination of ??hose who have called at the Comptroller's Office, Congress *.vi 11 unquestionably autho? rize thc issue ot' at least $100,000,000 addi? tional national currency. The Camptroll T :s not understood to oppose this measure ?.miler suitable restrictions, or provided a similar amount of legal ten.h rs wore re? tired, and all National Banks in existence ?jsom-pi lied to redeem their issues at the ?yroat commercial centres. -<-?-?-?

MESSES. EDITORS: NOV that politics aro belan: par. perhaps the system of "mecha? nics as a science" will have a showing. Politicians never yet pave real strength to any country-the mechanic always has and ever will do so. Nothing more than thc genius of mechanics, as developed at thc North, contributed to the overthrow of tho Southern Confederacy, (except,-indeed, thc corruption of sonic of our own officials;) but a new ora has commenced in the South . -cotton is no longer king, although a most useful servant, and tho whole resources of our wonderfully rich country can now be developed, which must bc dono principally by tita mechanic. Lot us of thc South take hold of the matter with enerby. Energy is, in fact, almost our only capital; but that we possess, or can, if wo will, und let all recollect that energy is superior to gold - and can make it. This is not tho foolish chimera followed so long by the alchemists of old, and in vain; but is a reality, which never fails its determined follower. Wc have even now in Columbia men whose profession is thc study and develop? ment of "scientific mechanics," and wc have operatives of ability second lo thoso of nc) other Southern city. Let thom or? ganize and form a "Mechanic's Institute," where each, man will impart instruction to his fellow upon some subject on which he may be peculiarly qualified, where thc standing of the mechanic as a citizen will be shown in its true light, proving to tho younger members that their first duty is obedience to order, and that, being useful human beings, they therefore hold a -moro honorable position in society than thoso drones of th?? community who rxist only for themselves, but yet protend to call themselves members of tho body politic. Heretofore, in our section, everything has boen subservient to agriculture; or rather, I should say, to tho very imperfect cultivation of cotton* To bi a planter, no matter on how small a scale, was > be a gentleman, and a mechanic was not looked upon a3 such. Without disparagement to tho cotton planter, a mechanic can also be a gentleman, and ho can also bo even a moro usfful member of society titan thc planter. Let the young men of the South think of this, and let them recollect that only by the proper encouragement of tho differe nt branches of the mechanical arts, can our couutry bo raised to that prosper? ous and eminent position to which it is entitled. In this good work, let Columbians take the lead. Barbarously sacked, devastated and im? poverished as our homo is now, our city was always worthy, and is still capable of, doing so-the materia! is here for tho foundation, and let us welcome, no -.natter from whence hi- comos, every true man who will aid in tho superstructure. Now is the time to commence. Let us have a "Mechanic's Institute," organized on tho principle <>f tho European gui!.ls, in which ! he eliler .-eld more experienced members will lill thc prominent positions, giving in? struction to the younger and less experi? enced, each in his own department; not pr. ve!.ling the noviciate, however, from presenting his views, if he is found com? petent t ) discuss the importance of the subject, and where thc interest of scientific industry will be properly and fairly cared Do n..t suppose, Messrs. Editors, that I wish lo disparage, in the least degree, agri cull ural or commercial pursuits, far from it ; they are necessary to the prosperity of every country. 1 merely wish to show, that, for the good of thc country, tho science-of mechanics is just as necessary, or more essential, perhaps, than tho mero products of the soil, which are in most in stanees virtually consumed* or exported to foreign paris.

Messrs. Stokes, Crayton, Duncan, Wil? liams and Dawkins submitted reports of committees. I The bill to raise supplies was discussed and amended. j Adjourned. Tile President'? Interpretation of thc Monroe Doctrine. There ia no question that the words of the President on foreign aggressions upon this continent in thc interests of monarchy, have great significance. There is no threat in them lo wound the most sensitive French honor, but there is I a very plain statement of the feeling and conviction of tito nation. We have con? sistently and carefully refrained from pro? pagating republicanism in Europe by any other Cuan moral means, and we expect a like moderation from European powers in regard to propagating monarchy in Ame? rica. But, sass thc President, with the tone becoming a discussion on so impoi - tant a question, "'We should regard it as a great calamity to ourselves, to thecauso of good government, and to the peace of the world, should any European power chal? lenge the American people, as it were, to thc defence of republicanism against for? eign interference. We cannot foresee, and arc unwilling t > consider, what opportu? nities might present thcmelves, what com? binations might offer, to protect ourselves against designs inimical to our form of government. The United States desire to act in the future aa they have ever acted here! fore; thej never will be driven from that course bnt by the aggression of Euro? pean {lower. ; c i I we rely on the wisdom and justice of tho^o powers to respect the system of non interference which has so l.mg been sanctioned by time, and whmh, by iis good result'', has approved itself to bo? h continents.' This language precisely reflects the feed? ing of thc natio i on this question. They would regard a war with Franco as a great calamity, both to this country and to tho world; they are disposed to proceed with the utmost mod?rai ion; still thev could never do otherwise than ci riskier tho French establishment by iorco of a nio narcy in Mexico as "... challenge to tho I defence of republicanism against foreign I interference." A martial nation like tho I French will understand our feelings by imagining what thc sentiments of the first French Republic would have been if Ger? many had forced a monarchy on Switzer? land; or still nearer, what the feelings of tho present Government would be if the Republicans of Europe, in combination with tho b nit. d States, had founded a Re? public on the Rhine, existing only.by Vine rican aid. A foreign monarchy forced on a sister republic, is a standing "challenge" ko the United States. As a mero matter of in? terest, there would be no great motive to object to Maximilian's kingdom. We should nndenbtedly carry on as much trade .vit li a Pre?en monarchical Mexico as with a native republican Mexico. No monarchy could ever weaken our repub? lican influence on this continent. Wo nave nothing to fear from a French Mexico. 100,000 French bayonets in that kingdom would bo as nothing to thc force we could hiing into the field. Moreover, tho barren plains between Texas and tho fertile parts of Mexico would be a sufficient protection against a foreign power in that country, while on the sea no European powcrwould have anything like the force and advan? tages we should necessarily possess. A French monarchy in Mexico is no real source of danger tous. Neither does tho United States desire the possession or absorption of Mexico. It would bea great misfortune to this country to incorporate her in the Union, even if her people wero willing. Those half-breeds and miserable mixtures of Indians and negroes and whites would never ho suited to our insti (tutionsor civilization. There is no hope or wish among our peoplu to annext Mexi? co. Still, notwithstanding all this, thc setting up of a monarchy on tho ruins of a republic, on this continent, and the time I and mode chosen" for thia act of aggres sion, cannot bat he always felt as an insult ? by tho masses of our people. They see and watch the grand struggle in Europe between democracy and imperialism or aristocracy. They know that the Emperor Napoleon is, by choice, both in literature and the more earnest world of fact, tho great de? fender of imperialism in Europe. They must consider titi? invasion cf the Ameri? can continent as a coming out of his way to throw down ii:- gauntlet to republi? canism in Amt rica. They consider it a ?)lain declaration of war -not of nations, mt of principles-made on this side of thc ocean, by the great representative of ar? bitrary power from the other. Moreover, th^y know nat where this is to end. An interference in Mexico to found a monarchy I may justify an interference somewhere else, to found a dependency of a European Stat? on the ruins of some republic. Our own Southern States might not be out of all danmor of a foreign ''establishment of 0.-i'?.\" This popular sentiment is ex? pressed by the President; but evidently with the hope, shared by al! the people, that the French Emperor, seeing the hopelessness of forcing a throne on tho j Mexicans, withdraw his forces and leave Maximilian to his fate. Still, tho earnest words succeeding show : that the President does not propose to j wait as long or as patiently aa Italy has j done for the withdrawal of the French troops from Home. No indefinite Algerian ' occupation will be permitted here. The ' President evidently hints at "combina- j tions" and "opportunities" which we should i employ in our defence, that would bc most perilous to imperialism in Europe. He I will not allow himself to "foresee" or j "consider" them, but we know well that j tho United States always lias an ally in Europe, ai d that democracy, though crushed there, is by no means dead. There arc invasions in the interest of liberty, as well as of imperialism, and thrones may bc overturned as well as erected. Tho President ?lees not permit himself to ''consider" this, lint tho people can. Perhaps the President ?loes uot allow him- : self to "foresee" what a rival to the | French throne might do tm the French | coast, with an American navy to back him. We, however, of the people, may be per- j mitted to consider all these possible com- ! binations in the last dreaded issue. Let us hope that the serious and respect? ful words of the President may be carefully j weighed by so intelligent a ruler as the ? French Emperor, and a struggle avoided, which, as Mr. Johnson says, would bc "a calamity to this country and tho world." [.Vcr York Times. Hero is what the Albany Argus thinks of Gen. butler: "lu his late speech before tho Massachusetts State Convention, Gen Butler took ground that 'the South has forfeited its political rights.' When ho was in New Orleans, he took the ground that the people of tho South had forfeited their silver spoons-and it was aftor ?vards found to bo true. There is ground for hopi-, kays tho New Haven Register, that the rights (not being 'con? vertible') are more likely to be returned than the silverware.
