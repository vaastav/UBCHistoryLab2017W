The first session of the 67th Congress opened Monday.

The federal supreme court handed down a decision Monday in the so-called "fourtetn-diamond-ring case," by which it is determined that duties collected by this government on goods brought from the Philippines, in the absence of legisla tion by Congress secially covering it, were wrongfully collected and must be remitted. The sovereignty of the islands passed from Sin to the I'nited States by treatv, and the Philippines became a jart of this country. Tariffs, unless Bsx-ially raised bv Congress subsequent to that time, cannot be enforced. This decision was iu line with the Porto Kican decision of last year. The so-call.-d Kooley case No. 2, involving the constitutionality of taxes paid in Porto Kico on goods shipped from New York was also decided, the tax being upheld. In each case the court was divided, 5 to 4. Great is the Game of Football.
