McClcllan was removed from Ins com mand brcausc it was pretended he had not moved with his army as lie had been ordered. The government champions of government action sought, and busily sought, to make the impression that he disobeyed orders, and that his reason1: for delay were not real. General Ilalleck in his super - serviceable letter said that three weeks had now elapsed. Four weeks have now elapsed, and where is Burnside? lie has had the benefit of all the very particulars quite ready, which the champions claim had been actually made for McClcllan, and yet he has not moved up. Have .they removed him, or talked of it? Not at all ; but they have actually found out that his army still lacked many things which McClcllan required, and which General Meigs said had been issued, but .which it turns out had never reached the army. They now talk of removing Gen eral Meigs for defects in the Quarter master's Department. But Gen. Me;g does not pppoint Lis own subordinates ; they are placed there by gentle fovorit-L-m, to feed needy dependent?!. 'General Burnside i an able man, and worthy to be trusted, but he moves in peril, snd if he fails he will be victimized by his meddling t-nperiors. The CincisMiati pa vans have at last pressed Colonel Lytic into the office of a Brigadier, and we shall probably hear no . more of the "bloody Tenth," who shot each other in the legs at Carnifex, where General Eosecrans waked up and found that Floyd was gone in the dead of night. . This thing of slipping away from that new " military necessity" General Rose Brans may b repeated within the present month. Ho has now advanced far enough for the enemy to return througo. Cumber land Gap into Kentucky, and cut off both communication and supplies. Congress met oa- Monday, with a mod erate attendance of members. Mr. Val landigham is the principal figure in the performance, and hastened to make hiiii- eelf eminently conspicuous. If he had not danc so, some one might have got ahead of him. Mr. Lincoln sent in his message, a-nd as usual, takes both sides of the constitu tional question on the subject of emanci pation. He had just Proclaimed that he had power to emancipate all slaves in the country as a military act ; now he propo ses to amend the Constitution t:o as to de clare that all slaves made free by the war shall be forever free, and then winds up by saying that he adheres to his Procla mation. . It is a satisfactory exposition of . his Proclamation that he regards it a nullity, and would like it made a valid act by amending the Constitution. We speaks of it from a synopsis only. We shall have the mesr age to-day, and will then treat of the document itself. "The Appeal of Missouri." An article under this designation, is published in the Missouri papers. It is addressed " To the Representatives, Press and People of the Northern States," and might be supposed to issue from some public body, or some authorized source, but no names are given with it. The Bubjeet of this paper will be a part of the next political action, and it is therefore proper for general consideration in the Wci'eni States, although they are not in cluded in the scheme of Missouri's ap peal. ... - It is announced that Missouri in her recent election of Senators and Repre sentatives has declared ia favor of abol ishing slavery ia that State. But that the Legislature whiuh is to meet ia a few weeks,- will find itself powerless to act, because the Coastitution of that 'ptate contains a clause providing that " the General Assembly shall have no power to pass law3 for the emancipation of slaves, without the consent of their owners, or without paying them, before sack emancipation, a full equivalent for euch slaves fo emancipated." As the attempt to- procuro consent of the owners .would make much delay, and as it would be expensive to Missouri to mako corn pensutioji herself, she wishes .Congress to do it for her, and she will do the like; for any other State in need. It is also held fi-tlt -indirectly, that there" will be much rii-h land for sale, and cf cour.:c a fine chance for investment. It should be borne in mind by the people of Ohio,, that . i. they got the "Union as it was," they will ,1m ve to pay at present one-twelfth of all debts created for the purchase- of slaves. But if they get the " Union as it is," they must pay' about one-eighth of it. This philanthropic enterprise therefore will cost something to somebody, and if en gaged in, must have the consent of pock ets, which in these latter days are likely to become both sentient and sensitive. This proposal of Missouri, as it is call ed, will of course meet with favor with the gentleman who is now filling the office of President ; we do not say favor with the President, for that would imply that he might lawfully have an official opinion on the subject. It would also find favor with that large body of men who always go with the President, what ever he may chance to think or do. A fair sample cf the consideration it will have, is given in the Ohio State Jour nal, of November 2u'th. The intelligent editor has been so long familiar with the platform literature and the convention reports peculiar to Republicanism, that he has unconsciously suffered his edito rial habits to give a side cast to his knowledge of facts. He speaks of the "organic law" of Missouri being formed at the dictation of the slave power, " and of the State being the first-born iu bon dage of the convulsive period" between 1819 and 1821. He snys that "no in telligent person can be ignorant of the fierce and fearful struggle through which Missouri became a State with a Constitu tion permitting and protecting slavery." How came there to bo a fearful struggle on the right of a State to determine for itself whether it would have slavery or not have it? Is it not now universally admitted that every State has the right, and the exclusive right to define what is called in modern' phrase "its domestic relations ?" How came it to be contest ed then? Who began it? Was slavery an unusual thing? that the South was bringing into Conirress in order to co erce the public? The fact is that sla very had existed in Saint Louis before the Revolution before any American Constitution was made and very long before the United States became the owner of Louisiana. The treaty with France by which we became the owner, guaranteed to the inhabitants of Louisi ana all their existing rights and privil eges, among which was the common right of holding slaves. By act of Con gress, passed in 1812, the remaining Territory of Lousiana became the Ter ritory of Missouri, with a regular Terri torial Government and a local Legisla ture, with power to make laws civil and criminal, in all cases not inconsistent with the laws of the United States, and these laws to be iu force in all cases, un less disapproved by Congress. Slavery was then the law of all the land, except where prohibited, and with a full knowl edge on the part of Congress that slavery existed iu Missouri, and without any attempt to disallow it. And when Con gress had given authority to make a Con stitution, and be admitted as a State, no re striction o.i slavery had then been impos ed. And yet when the State came to be admitted into the Union, the admission was resisted on the ground that slavery was permitted. Alabama had teen ad mitted but a few months before without objection. Tennessee and Kentucky had been admitted years before without restriction, but now it was to be made a question, for Northern politicians, and from that day forth the thing has grown until the contest has reached the present height, and these people are talking all the while of Southern dictation and Southern encroachment. There has been no stint of Southern dictation and South ern bullying, fur none of which have we any word of palliation, but justice re quires it to be said that they are not alona blameless. All our evils flow from one source a perverse meddling with the laws of the States a perverse inter meddling with other people's affairs a spirit of domination and seif-rightcous-ncss. Justice Swayne and Change Tickets. A 

PARAGRAPH is circulating in some Ohio papers that Justice Swayne had recently decided in the Circuit Court at Cleveland, that the laws of Ohio against unauthorized bank paper, and particu larly change tickets, were unconstitu tional. Of course this is a mistake, for no such question could get before a Cir cuit Court of the United States. The uristake is probably this: The present Congress passed a law, or attempted to do so, making postage stamps a currency for small change. To this act was an nexed a prohibition against the making of change tickets by person?, companies, and corporations, and the prohibition was to be enforced by fine and imprison ment. If any person was indicted in the Circuit Court for violating this pretend ded law, the question of its validity would be presented, and if presented would of course be pronounced void for want of power in Cong.css to euact such a law. We shall look with interest for an authentic statement of what was really done, for the case is an excellent omen, but only what was to be expected from a learned and upright Judge. . A v.'o.'.lan in love with you will easily forgive a great indiscretion, but never a cni-II luuvli-aey. Legislative Encouragement to Deprecators. The Legislature of Ohio should have due credit for the skill and care exerted in providing convenient escape for petty by providing a fine which they did not intend should be collected. Men of no property laugh at the judgments against them, and men with a good deal j of property a "homestead and furniture can tell the scamps they have nothing to spare. t ; w - The same care has Been exercised in j favor of depredators on property." Wc ( had a law that any one who injured the property of another, might be fined in j any sum not exceeding one hundred dol- j hirs or imprisoned, or be both filled and , imprisoned. A very sympathetic legis- J hiturc have now provided that there shall be no imprisonment unless the damage be of the value of fifty cent.-?. Under this a reckless blackguard may threw a stone through your window every day. and you may have him fined for it; he may carry a club and bent off your pail- ings, or break a limb from your shade tree, or steal your first specimens of fruit, on a tree you have been training, and you may have him fined. lie may be per fectly worthless, and you cannot imprison him because you cannot prove the value to be fifty cents. The law was specially amended to introduce this lenient protec tion to small depredations. Judge Brinkerhoff We have scon it stated in an Ohio paper, that Judge Brinkerhoff, pretend ing to act as Deputy Provost Marshal, and belted with pistols, had arrested two persons iu Stark county, and one in Sen eca, and had taken them to a prison in r Mansfield. It is not possible that such a thing can be true, as Judge Brinker hoff knows too well the nullity of the Provost Marshal power, aud even if it were lawful, it would be unseemly for a Supreme Court Judge to play the part of a catchpole, and parade the streets with pistols. Editors should be more careful of our State ditrnitv. and not cive cur - rpnfir in Qrfb t),in'. co ;,nr,na;l ,lf nr, their face, and so derogatory to thc Bench. Rule of Ruin. If the persons now charged with thc administration of the Government would consent to use the power of the nation for the suppression of insurrection, and the restoration of law, the whole nation, except the Insurgents, would unite iu one common purpose. Eat these men are perversely bent on the overthrow of slavery as the only condition on which they will agree to have success. T!y this pervcrseness they lose the hearty and willing snpport of more th;:n h.-.lf the loyal people of the country a part acquiesce, giving no help a part arc driven into sturdy opposition. Enlistment. Manv persons have been imprisoned, without regular commitment on that un defined offense of "discouraging enlist ment." Many such persons are in pris on yet, when thc power of enlistment is almost wholly gone. Volunteering is done for, aud any engagements nomin ally of that character, are mere eontrnets for monthly pay and bounty. The whole body of the people discourage and refuse. "What are you going to do about it?" as Cadwcll said. It will take a huge prison to hold them, and an army of keepers to guard them. A Safe Proviso. JIr. Chase has been spoken of sever al times as willing to be a Senator airain. lie would resign the Treasury if he was sure of election as Senator, said one of the Cincinnati Gazette's letter writers. Xow it is said that he has written a let ter to Mr. C F. Wade, saying that he will not be a candidate unless it is cer tain that Wade cannot be elected. Ex cellent! Xow just make his election im possible, and then come in. Mr. Chase must have some convenient escape from the Treasury, or ho will take to bad health. He is doing the s.'a?;?p business now, and when that is through he will stampede. Peace. Wnxx shall we have peace? is begin ning to be asked in some quarters. Som'e philanthropists have thought it a good plan to exterminate the Southern people to prevent future trouble. There is a couplet in Byron Bride of Abydos, which may be aptly cited: "Mark! T.herc his carnage and LU conquests cease ! 11c makes a solitude and calls it peace !" Certain enterprising journals are giv ing pretended summaries of what the President's Message will contain when submitted to Congress on the emancipa tion and confiscation questions. Now we do not as-u:ne to know what thc Presi dent will recommend touching these mat ters, but wc hum!;!' conceive what he ought to re?or.imcnd. lie should say in substance: " Gentlemen you made a mis take in passing the confiscation act; I made a greater one in issuing the procla mation. Let us submit to the will of the people as expressed by the recent elec tions. You repeal the act aud I will withhold the proclamation on the 1st of January. This will unite the North, and the war can then be pushed rapidly for ward in the name of thc Union, the Con stitution, and the euioiceiucnt of the law-?. Ar. Y. Vi'uld. Burnside on McClallan. Fed a meeting at the Cooper Institute, New York, ami ia the couvso of his re thefts, marks, said : I risk your forbearance for, ywir, par tienee with, yrmr confidence in, the young chief who has now assumed the command, (I have known -him. most intimately as students together, as soldiers in the field, and as private .citizens.'' For-year's" wc have lived iu the same family, and I know him "as welfas I know any human being on the face of the earth, and I know that no more honest, conscientious man exist" than General McClcllan. I know that no feeling of ambition beyond that -of the and the success of our cause" evef entered his breast. All that, he does, is with a single eye, a single view, to the success of this government and the put law, ; ting down of the rebellion. I know that i nothing under the sun will ever induce j that man to swerve from what he knows A year aio, General Burnside addres- to be his duty. He is an honest, Cbris- tian-likc and conscientious man ; and now let me add one thing, that he has the soundest head and the clearest military perception of any man in the United States. A Letter from the C6th Regiment, on our first page, copied from the Delaware Standard, no doubt cypresses the opinion of the whole army on the effects of the proclamation. The writer, like a great many other good men, is mistaken as to the ri-jlit to issue the Emancipation Edict there is no such right; but he speaks honestly its belief. The paper which publishes this letter supported the edict of Mr. Lincoln. The Tribune accounts for the heavy Wadsworth majority ii St. Lawrence county by the fact that " ita ample do main" is without a " rum-cursed city or village."

The Editor of the St. Croi.x HeraUl says : Pviding through Terry the other day in company with a friend, we met a young o man dressed iu bloomer costume, driving a yoke of oxen. Sho was engaged in lifting a stick of timber, which being rather too heavy lor her lo manage, we prcTered our seruice in assistance, which were gladly acceplc. She could beat our friend in lifting, and is a " whold team." She informed us that she a -tended regularly to outdoor work every dav, chopped wood, drove exen, and preformed all other labor incident to farming operations. Is answer to inquiiies from Cincinnati it is stated at the Treasury Department that little postal currency is now going to Ohio or the west, that a million and a half has to lie fur nisheU to the army, amf until that is done others must wait. When the collectors in Cincinnati and elsewhere draw funds, they get part in poslage currency, but receive none in any other way. One hundred thous and dollars in poslal currency have recently been furnished to the Western. railroads, thc Secretary being of the opinion that is about the best way toaOTect a thorough distribution, and as soon as possible another $100,000 will be sent to the same parties. " M'-Clei.i.as has not dah enongh" many complain. Perhaps he might as well have more of it ; though the kindling eye, and quick tone and reply of a young Jerscyman, badly wounded at Antietam, and barely able to sustain the journey " home"' to have his sore hurts healed come to one's memory when hearing such a complaint. " McClcllan has no dush" said a lady near the young sol dier in the cars. ' Oh, madam, Pupe. has the dash!" Boston Post. The exports from the loyal State during the last fiscal year sixty-two millions more than during the year before. The exports from Southern States are one hundred and ninety six millions less, thus making the deficit io the total amount of expoits, exclusive of gold, from all parts of the country of one hundred and thirty four millions. i New York City Election.

Brennan, Democrat, is elected over Haws, Republican, by about 10.000 majority, aud Devlin, Demo crat, is elected as Corporation Council, over Bradford, by nearly 15.000 majority.
