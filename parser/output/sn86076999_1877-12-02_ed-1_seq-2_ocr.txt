MORNING APPEAL. SINDAY DECEMBER 2. 187' SUNDAY READING. We are a long way from agreeing with all the conclusions and doctrinal arguments of the Reverend Joseph Cook ; but we are glad of an onriortunitv to reDroduce some of his very effective and entertaining sentences. We ouote aa follows from a sermon on Con science : Conscience guarantees only good inten tions. Are they enough ? If conscience when truly followed, does not give us sound ness of judgment, really it is not a very 1m Dortant facultv. vou say. But let us notice what can be proved beyond a doubt, namely that a man who follows conscience we are able to respect, and that we are not able to respect any other man. There is Stonewall Jack son, and here is John Jrown. iNow let us suppose that Stonewall Jackson believes that John Erown is utterly honest ; and let us suppose that John Brown believes the same of Jackson. Brown's action appears to Jack son to be very mischievous, and Jackson's action appears to Brown to be equally so. In fact, they are crossing bayonets in a civil war ; but they are both men of prayer, men of confirmed religious habits, and we. have reason to believe that they are endeavoring to be conscientious. I do not believe Stone wall Jackson followed all the light he had nor do I believe that John Brown did. But suppose that Jackson did follow all the light he had or could get, and suppose that J ohn Brown did. and that each is convinced of this fact as to the other ; then, although they are ready in the settlement of practical meas ures to cross bayonets, you cannot help their coming together when the measures are set tled and shakins hands with each other as respectable men. You know that to be the fact. External acts differ to the demee of crossing bayonets ; but as each does the best he knows how, each respects the other, and absolutely cannot help doing so. This is singular fact in the soul ; but this is the way we are made. We find that Governor Wise when he looked into the eyes of J ohn Brown and saw honesty there, and that others who ... .. . . . . noticed his mood in his last hours, were thrown into a kind of awe by that border warror. He meant rirlit : and respect for that man's soul is not confined to the circle of the mountains between which he lies iti my native county in northern New York. I have heard the summer wind sighing over the grave of John Brown, and have stood there and gazed upon Mount JIarcy and Whiteface and Lake Placid ; but because I believed that this man's conscience was a Lake Placid, and his resolution to follow it linn as Marcy, firm as Whiteface, firm as any of those gigantic peaks in my native Switzerland I felt sure that his soul was inarching on, and that when his spirit smote slavery, the tree after that was timber. It did not fall, but it was no longer alive. There was a persecutor of the early church who verily thought he ought to do many things against Christianity. He himself teaches us that he needed pardon, but that mercy was shown him because of his igno rance. Who will say that he did not sup press light ? Not I. He did immense mis chief while his judgment was not corrected and if he suppressed light, or tutored it, his motives were not good. This i3 most dan gerous ground. I know on what treacherous soil I tread, unless definitions are kept in view. Choice means love ; conscientious ness is glad self-surrender to a personal God in conscience, or to what ought to be in mo tives. Let us take the precaution of using pictures as well as metaphysical phrases. There is a point in the bounding, resonant Androscoggin at which is an island, and on it lives a hermit Twenty savages are sail ing down in the midnight to surprise him and put him to death. A Maine legend says that he puts a light below the deadly Lewis -ton waterfalls that lie just beyond his island. The Indians think the torch is in his hut ; row toward it ; and all of them make a sud den, dizzy, unexpected plunge to death. The Indians were in one sense right ; they wanted to land where the light was ; but the licrht was below the falls and not above. It in tolerably important to know where the " a. beacon is, whether below or above the cata ract." Conscience is your magnetic needle. Rea son is your chart. But I would rather have a crew willing to follow the indications of the needle and giving themselves no great trouble as to the chart, than a crew that had ever so good a chart and no needle at all. Which is more important in the high seas of passion, the needle conscience or the chart reason ? We know it was the discovery of the physical needle that made navigation possible on the physical seas ; and loyalty to the spiritual magnetic needle alone makes navigation safe on the spiritual seas. When we find a needle in man through which flow magnetic currents and courses of influence that roll around the whole globe and fill the universe, causing every orb to balance with upright pole, we know there is in the needle some thing that is in it but not of it ; and we may well stand in awe of it, and refuse to tutor it. Show me a crew without a chart, but willing to follow the needle, and I will show you safe navigator but show me a crew with a chart, who will not look at the needle, and I will show you navigators near wreck. Here is a beautiful little poem, not inappro priate to be coupled with some recent reflec tions: LIFE AND DEATH. "What is Life, father?" "A battle, my child, Where the strongest lance may fail, Where the wariest eye may be beguiled, And the stoutest heart may quail. Where foes are gathered on every hand. And rest not, day nor night, And the feeble little ones must stand In the tldckest of the fight." "What is Death, father?' "The rest, my child. When the strife and toil are o'er; The Angel of God, who, calm and mild, Says we need fight no more; Who driveth away the demon band, Bids the din of battle cease, Takes the banner and the sjiear from the falling hand, And proclaims an eternal peace." "Let me die, father! I tremble and fear To yield in that terrible strife." "The crown must be worn for heaven, dear, In the battle-field of Life. My child, tho' thy foes are strong and tried, He loveth the weak and small; The Angels of heaven are on thy side, And God is over all " A SUGGESTIVE WARNING. BACK AT THE OLD PLACE. We are informed by a notice under the ed itorial head of yesterday's Enterprise that Mr. R. M. Daggett is once more at the edito rial desk of that paper. The Morning Ap peal knows of no incident in Nevada Jour nalism which is more encouraging. We wel come our old comrade back to duty none the less heartily because of his long furlough. PATTERSON AT BAY. Patterson, driven to bay, pits his indict ment against the President's Wormley Treaty. He protests that his surrender to the Butler- ites is no worse than Hayes's abandonment of the Republicans of the South to the tender mercies of the Ku Klux Klans. He takes his stand, desperately, and asks that it be com pared with that assumed by Stanley Mat thews, by Hoar of Massachusetts and by other Republicans in and out of the Senate who support Hayes. Patterson is a bull in a china-shop ; an enfant terrible ; a merciless State witness ; a counter plotter of amazing vigor and forcefulness. He is a terrible re sistant to the President's Policy. The sting of his reproach is in its truth. We quote from the dispatches : Reverting to the South ern policy he said : "As I understand that policy in its final analysis and its sure conse quences, it means the abandonment of politi cal friends to conciliate political foes. It makes the further mistake of assuming that it is the Democratic South that must be concili- ted whereas it is the mighty Republican North that should be conciliated. This scheme or policy of conciliation involves, I am informed, the rehabilitation or revival of the old Whig party as a necessary agent to secure its per manent success. If the President can effect this if he can go down into the political val ley of dry bones and infuse life and motion once more into the scattered life of the Whig party he will stand confessed as the cham pion resurrectionist of the age. No, sir, it cannot be done. As well might some deluded architect attempt to erect the thousand pala ces of a great city out of the broken and mold- ering tombstones of an ancient village grave yard. But it is now an open secret that the President says that he intends to reinforce, or supplement, the resurrected Whig party with the merchant and religious element in the South, and then incorporate this trinity thus formed into the National Republican party. I am not aware that there are any live mer chants in the South with present party ties or political identity. If there are any such, then they are not properly represented by the New Orleans, Mobile, Charleston and Savannah Chambers of Commerce : and as for the relig ious element of the South, they worship God and the Democracy, and will not bow down to this graven image called ' Hayes' Southern policy.' But whatever this policy is in theory we know what it is not in practice. It cer tainly is not the protection of Republicans in the Southern States in the free exercise of all their rights as American citizens, and the just recognition of their great and timely political services. We know it i3 built on a brokeu political trust, and its corner stone is laid in black ingratitude and cemented by the blood of betrayed political friends. Sir, the Repub licans of the South are not dead, nor are they sleeping. The Athenians reared a monument to Time, and inscribed it : 'To him who aven ges Time.' Time, sir, will avenge this great wrong, and that in no far distant future. The now down-trodden Republicans of the South will remember both those who be friended them and those who betrayed them in the day of their need. Doubt less the Republicans of the South have been guilty of many errors and are responsible for much of the maladministration of Southern State governments during the past eight years; but whatever their previous faults, betraying their friends was not one of them. I have said that whatever protection Republicans enjoy in the South, so far as their persons and prop erty were guarded against violence, they owe to the clemency of the victor. This is em phatically true in South Carolina,so far as the influence of Governor Hampton extends. I believe he is a just and honorable man aud intends to inforce a just and impartial admin istration of the laws without regard to race or party. But, benign as are his purposes,there is a 'power behind the throne stronger than the throne itself,' and he sits silent and inac tive while the State is terrorized and Republi cans are crowded into the jail of Columbia through flagrant political conspiracy prosecu ted by Democratic officials against them un der the forms of laws." To meet the Southern man of this genera tion and get his respect, take off the glove of mail and hold it iu the left hand and say "shake," but don't lose the glove. And be ware, Mr. Hayes, of thinking the little issue to be the bigger. Civil service reform even when it is a reform by intention, is premature in this young country. In England it merely consists in throwing the crumbs under the table to the dogs and Lazarus. The square meal is eaten by patronage and influence still. To Republicans the fact that two Democrats will presently be sitting in the United States Senate from Ohio and Indiana states happy in the possession of so many young soldiers' graves, whence freedom rose imperial from among the yeomanry and raised her Grants, McPhersons and Mortons is humiliating enough. What compensation for that loss is Stanley Matthews, or even R. B. Hayes? Far better would it have been to let the ex ecutive go and hold the legislative depart ment than to be beaten out of the one and half considered in the other. The President of the United States does not behave like a bold man, satisfied of his title. It is on record that King John, of England, who stle his crown, made concessions to the Barons. But history never wasted any praise on John. The President will live to find, like General Grant, that, do what he will for "reformers," they will upbraid him at last. His civil service policy has made no impres sion on the Democsatic party, which is win ning by it; they will repudiate it and carry the country, and then we shall have no re form but reaction for years and will put a black mark under the name of the President who "gave us away." SNOW IN THE SIERRA. A Woman Commits Spicide. The Silver State of November 30 alludes to a. suicide as follows: The town of Unionville was thrown into a state of excitement last Wednesday by the death of Mrs. Peter Spors by her own hand. Deceased, who was about 42 years of age, was exceedingly jealous of her husband, but why, it was difficult for her neighbors to conjecture, as he was a man of over 60 years of age, and not exactly what might be con sidered a "ladv's man" in appearance or man ners. The idea that he thought more of other women than of his lawfully wedded wife so preyed upon the mind of Mrs. bpors that she became insane on the subject and took laudanum to end her existence.

Paradise is in Humboldt. That it is in the garden of Eatin' is plainly hinted by the Sil ver State as follows: "A correspondent of the Silver State at Paradise Valley writes that the Grangers of that valley are building a grain and flour depot at Tuscarora. Recon zoni's teams are now on the road from this place loaded with lumber for that purpose. I he Grangers also contemplate building a grist mill next season. The School Trustees have ordered new furniture for the school house, and a team loaded with desks is now -on the way to the valley. The school is now, as it has been for years, under the supervis ion of Prof. J. B. Case, who has no superior as a teacher in the State. SEW ADVERTISEMENT. THE EVENT OF THE SEASON! CARSON THEATER. The Reno Gazette of Friday evening in forms us as follows: The snow-fall -in the Sierra Nevadas has not been very heavy this season, and as a result the snow line along the crest and slopes of the range from Oregon to Arizona has not been established. This is not surprising, as it is yet early in the season for deep snows. The Central Pacific Railway Company's daily weather report show that there have been twelve snowy days since the 10th of October. The heaviest fall was 7 in ches occurred early in the present month, and the total fall is 37 inches. At Cisco 22 inches have been registered, between Winne mueca and Toana stations, the fall of snow has been exceedingly light. One of the the ories f weather sharps is that copious rains in the valleys and plains follow a heavy lodge ment of snow on the mountains; and to a certain extent observation has demonstrated the correctness of the theory. It is argued that when the warm currents of air from the ocean come into contact with the colder cur rent from the snow fields the vapor is con denced into showers which fall on the lands between the foot-hills and the coast. In the absence of the snow line the conditions are unfavorable to condensation and the rainfall is consequently light. TWO NIGHTS & WEDNESDAY MATINEE.

IHE LARGEST assortment of AND 01O9T COMPLETE The Dead Clown. The following account of a pretense of death which found a real corpse as its representative is told by the Sun: Whoever has habitually attended circuses in this country remembers the Conrad brothers, acrobatic clowns, and their comical perform ance, in which one pretended to be dead, while the other tumbled about. They recently went to Germany. The London Era contains the following: "One evening the elder Conrad fell to the ground after a pretended blow, and was turned and returned, as usual. His arms and legs were jerked, he was struck and kicked and dragged, but preserved a steady impassibility. Suddenly an expression of dis tress could be noticed through the grotesquely painted lineaments of his brother, who hastily dropped upon his knees and placed his hand upon the heart of the inanimate clown, ex claiming 'My poor brother is dead!" At this the audience only lahghed. 'Gentlemen,' said the disiressed man, with tears in his voice, 'I assure you that he is dead.' Then taking him ia his arms, he bore him from the arena. The crowd appeared struck with the natural manner in which the bereft clown expressed grief, and applauded him vigorously as he de parted. There were loud encores for both, but neither preenod himae'f. Death had been more thoroughly simulated than ever before. Dinner Bill of Fare, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 2. Chicken, Bouillon. SOUPS.

A World's Washing ton special says the first annual message of the President was not received at the Cabi net meeting to-day, because it had not been completed. A special meeting is to beheld to-morrow or on Monday, at which it will be read in full. According to the present un derstanding it will be mailed from here on Sunday and delivered to the press as soon as submitted to Congress on Monday. The President and Secretary of the Treasury will earnestly oppose the repeal or modification of the Act of 1875 for resumption of specie payments. The President will favor remon etization of silver on any basis which will not impair the public credit, and will therefore favor the restriction of its legal tender char acter. The message will take strong grounds in favor of the protection of citizens and their property on the Rio Grande border, and of the settlement of our difficulties with Mex ico. It will also recommeud great economy in every branch of the public service, owing to the diminished receipts of revenue. The correctness of these foreshado wings of the message will be confirmed on Monday by the message itself. $12.50 Teeth ! Teeth! $12.50
