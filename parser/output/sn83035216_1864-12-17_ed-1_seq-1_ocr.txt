President's Message. 

CONCLUDED. THE LESSON OF THE RECENT ELECTION. Tht most reliable indications of public purpose in this country, is derircd through Onr popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass and its result, tbe purpose of the people within the loyal Slutes to maintain tbe integrity of the Union was never more Btni nor mote cearly nnaiiimoos than now. The extraordinary calmness and good order with which millions'of voters met and min Kd at tbe polls gave strong assurance of this. Not only all those who supported the Union ticket, so called, but a great mil- joriiy of tbe opposing party al.o, may be fun ly claimed to emertain and to bo actu a ed by the samo purpose- It is an nnan sweialle argument lo this effect that no cnndidnte fur any office, whatever, hiijh or low, has ventured to seek on the avowal ibai he was for giving up the Union. There has been much impimging of mo tives and ruui'b heme I con trovorsv. as lo the proper means and the best mode of ad vancing the Union cauxr, but in the dis Unci istme of Union or no Union, the poli ticians have shoa n their inRiinc'ive knowl edge that there is no diversity nmonp: tht people. Io awarding the people tbe fair rpportanity of showing ooe to another and tbe world this firmness and unanimity of purpose the elect iou has been of vaxl value o the Natiooal cause. The election has exhibited another fact, not less valuable to. be kbowo, tbe fuel that we do uot ap proach exhaustion in the most important branch of the National resources, that of living men. While it is melancholy to re flect thai th war has filled so many g-ares and caused mourning to i-o many homes, it is some relief to know that, compared with il e Biiiviving, the fallen bare been so few. Whole corps, and divisions, ' and brigades. and regiments have formed, and fiiighr, and dwindled, and gone oat of existence. A great mij triiy of the men that com prised tbem are still living. The tame .is true of the Laval tervice. The election returns prove this so 80 cany voters could not else be found. ' The States regu larly holding elections, both now and four yearn ago, to wit 1 California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ken tucky, Maiue, Maryland, Masarhaseits, Michigan, Minnesota1, Missouri, . New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Yoik, Ohio, Oitg'n, Pennsylvania, llhoda Island, Ver mom, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, cast. 3.982,011 votes now, against 3.870.222 cast then, showing an aggregate now of 3,082,011, to which is to be udded 33,762. diet now in the new State of K uisai end Nevada, which States did not vote in 18G0.

To (bis again should be added the nnm- ber of all soldiers in the field from Mn-a- chu ctts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Dela ware, Itiaiana, Illinois, and California, who by ire laws of tho-e States could not vote away from their homes, and which nnmber cinnot be less than 90,000. Nor vet is this all. The number in organized Terri tories is a inQe more uow than what it was four years ego v. h ie thousands of white and block, join as at tbe national arms aud press buck ihe insurgent lines So much is shown hffirmatively and negatively, by i ho election. It is uot material to enquire how the increase has been produced or to show that it would have been greater but for the war, which is probably true. The important fact remains demonstra ted, that, we have more men now than we had when the war ucgan. luat we are not exhausted nor in process of exhaustion That we are gaining strength, and may, K need be, maiu'uin the contest Indcuiiiteiy. This as to men. Material and resources are now more completo and abundant than ever. J tie national resources men bi b uii exhoostid, and afl we believe, inexhausti ble. The public purpose to re-establish and' miiiiitain the notional au hority is un changed, and ri we believe, unchangeable. NEGOTIATION WITH REBEL LEADERS IMPOLITIC. hoy and th. (uel re cently Tbe manner of continuing the efforts re mains to choose. On careful considera tion of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with tbe insurgent leaders coutd result iu any good. lie would accept of nothing short of tbe severauce of the Uuion. llis dec larations to that effeot ere explicit and oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. lie affords ns no excuse lo deceive onrselves! We canuot voluntarily yield it. Between him and us tho issue is distinct, simple and inflexible. 'It is an issue which rnn ha tried onlv bv war and decided ouly i,w virMnrv. If we vield we are beaten. the Southern people fail him he is beaten either way it would be tbe victory and do feat folio ing war.

Tber can at any momeut have peace, simply by toying down1 their srmAnd sob mining to tbe uatiouat authority under Constitution, After so much, tbe Goveru meiit could not, If il would,- maintain war gainst them- , Tbe loyal people would sustain or allow it. If questions should a l e u . A L. aU remaiu, we wpuia eajtisi mem oy peaceful means of legislation, conference, courts and voters. Operating, only in eonaiitntroual and lawful channel, some lain and other possible questions, wonld be bejond tbe Execative power .J:.... r 1 . ':.. ..i0,a,,vu. iuo nuuiinniuii ui fttljtist. For instaneo, tbe admission of members Into Congress, or whatever might require the a ppropriolion of money. The Ex cutive power itself would be g-emly dinroUhed by tbe ecusation of actual war. Pardons a'nd remisious of forfeliures, bow ever, wonld still be i hin executive con trol. In what spirit and temper this con trol would be exercise! can bo f iirly judg ed by tho ptst. A year ego, general par don and iimuesiy npon designated teims were off red to all except certain designa ted classes, and it was at the same time mude known that the excepted classes were s ill wituia liio conteuitilation of SDecial clemency. During the year many availed tlirm selves of the general provision, end many msre would only that tbe signs of bud fniih iu tome, led to suub precautionary meas ures us rendered the practicul process less tufj and certain, during tbe same lime al so, soccial pardons have been granted to individuals of excepted classes, and oo vol untary application has been denied. Tbus. practically, tbe djor has beeu for a full yeor open to all except such as wore not in eourtition to make free choice : tbot is, such as were io custody of under constraint. Ie is still open to all. but the time may come, probably will come, when public du ty snail at-maud that it he closed, and that, iu lieu, raoie vigorous measures tuaa here ofore shall bo alopted. NO STEP BACKWARD ON THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY. VERY. In presenting the abandonment of arm ed resistance to the National authority on tbe part of the insurgents as tbe only io dispeosible condition to ending the war on the part of the Government. I retract nothing heretofore said at to slavery. I repeat (tie declaration made a year ago, and that while I remain io my preseut po attton I shall not attempt : to retract or modify tho Emancipation Pioclumaiion, nor shall I return to silvery any person who is free by the term) of that proclama tion or by any of ibo acts of Congress. If the people should, by whatever mode or meaus, make it au executive du'y to re-enslave such persons, another and not I must be their intiumcnt to perform it. In sta ting a single condition of peace, I mean simply to sty that the war will cease on the pure of tbe Government whenever it .hull have ceased on tbe part of tho-e-who began it. ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

Nevertheless, it is vaguo and supeitiuiul. It deals care- W.ly with those points that are of para mount tuterest to the publn, and evinces uo. statemanlike onaljsin of tbe political situation. It sheds no ruy of hope upon the future. Perusing it with a vaia ex pectation of Gliding some clue that my lend out of the dismal luhyrinths of inter sections! dissension, the patriot will put it aside will a sigh, r uiufully conscious thai it i.eiiber solves nor was intended to solve the terrible enigma. Ii is emphatic and phiiu spoken only when it tfa mi that. the. war shall be prosecuted to t tie bitter eud." The World which sometiiu:s conceals its par tisanship with Ibe Rebellion uuderau affectation of regard for the aid Uuioo, remarks with its usual bland courtesy : "A more tame, j june, commonplace state pupcr never emaualed from a man clothed with high responsiLili iei. It is, iu the main, a tepid recital of certain points aud statistics from tho reports of the heads of tbe executive departments, iu a style not better (ban is attained by every abridger of documeuts in a ncwr-paper. Ii does not reach even tbe subordinate merits of method and proportion. , 1'uults of arrangement, however, are trivial, when compared with poverty -of mutter. Ibe bievity of the uiet-suge would, under any circumstauces, be a mer it ; but iu this case the merit . would have been more conspicuous, hud it been still borler. Succinctness resultiug fom close ness and coiiacnsatiou is a very diQereol thing from tbe penury of a barreu intel lect. Tbe intellectual poverty of the mes- 6uge is iu no degree atoned for by patriotic fervor or elevation or senumcut. It is amazing that a man called lo be the chief actor iu tbe most momentous civil struggle ibe world ever saw is lifted to uo inspira tiou. It Mr. Lincoln understood bis ep och, one would naturally expect that its graudour would impress his .imagination. But the message is at cold as it is feeble. "Such a document -affords no scope for particular comracut. Ii is beneath it. It is idle lo confute what nobody will remem ber; and as for comtneudation. even the Republican organs will be at a loss lo be stow it. . Iu a curious financial recommendation be deviates for ouce into origiuality; but it is au originality which is painfully sug geslive of a low tone of moral feeling. We must indeed coueede to Mr. Lincoln the possession of a perfectly balanced charac ter: bis conscience is worthy of hU iotel lect, and bis sense of decorum worthy of . bolb. . lie gravely recommends that our government sbull . raise money from our citizens by corrupting their sense of pecuuiary honor I lie wants Congress to pass au aol to protect tbe purchasers Uovein ueut bouds trous paying iheir hon est debts I : lie gravel reeommeudi - tba this species of property shetU be placed be yond tbe reach not ouly of taxation but creditors. : It is a speoiacle as asionudiDg as it Is melancholy lo see the Chief Magi irate of a great nation asking Oougress suable cuizeus to cheat their creditors of their honest dues." Tit Journal of Commirci, which' has "re . . , i i i- urea IfOUl CO III Ci. ventares BS much ol in of ot to tired from politics,' opiuioo as this t , "On thee points relating to tho policy which iio will ptirsne, it indicates so un changed purpose tbe most niggesrlvtr pas sage in the document beirg perhaps that in which he iutimatcs that tbe ex sting of fers of pardon to Rebels may become no longer practicable, and that the 'itiie 'prob ably will come' when the door of pardon must be closed, and 'that in lieu more vig orons measures than heretofore' must be adopted, ; "There is very great plainness of speecb in tbe Message, which makes no pretence to ornate language, and deals only in the most easily understood phrases." The Herald, as its manner is, carries water on both shoulders, aud spills from bolb ! . "As usual with all his state papers, it Is a plain, unpretending docntnetr; and iu this respect, and in the matter ot brevity, Lincoln is an immense improvement npon Buchanan and poor. Pierce, with their heavy and dismal electioneer iug pamphlets It is an encouraging report ou tbe Slate of Ibo nation, and embodies varioa, timely and practical recommendations to the two bouses, although in some things of g'ei moment it falls short on tbe mark. "Tdus the Slaveholders of R-beldom are placed between two consuming Sies. . If they still adhere to Jeff Davis they must give np Slavery in giving up their negroes, aud a farm to boot of fifty acres to each uegro soldier; and if they abandon Davis they must subscribe to O d Abe's Emanci pation PiocUumions. This, we think, is one of the wenk points of the Message, and the other roost prominent is Gideon Welles. Aud so we turn ii over to the digestion of tbe two Houses of Cougres aud onr readers.", ., .. ,. .-. i,;.' The Times, which uiffurs from The Herald in seeking always to carry water on neitite'r shoulder, strains the clear stream of the Presi dent's good sense and good faith through Sew ard's eulauder, iu Ibis fashion : ' ' " ' "Tbe most salient feature in tbe Mes sage is the emphatic declaration of the 1'ieoidcur, that be reotgtiizfcs but one sin gle conditiou for peace and th'it, tho re turu of Rubels to ibeir allegiance, lie says: 'Ttiey can at any time have peuue .imply by iayiug down their arms, and sub mitting .to the national authority under ibe Coustiiu iou.' The Presideut neither insists upou tior looks for any stipulation iu advui.ee in tespeci to the abandonment of Slavery. His only claim is for au ubuu- doumeut of armed re.istauce. Ibis-makes good ' precisely w b it we have contended tens the true construction of tbe famous missive. 'To whom it may concern.'

Yet in this be is perfectly cou Bisteut. That proclamation was a war meusure, ou.hoiizi;d by the war power in volved iu the duty prescribed to the Exeo uiive by tbe Constitution to enforce tbe laws. lis operative force must rouliuue a bile tbe war lusts.

Il can buve no further , continuing effect, though tha eff-ct already couMiniHird, uhu'.cver the con ts may decide that to bp, cuuuot bo undone, uud must rtmaiu un changed. The President holds to the Pioclumaiion in just the right manner He treats it as au instrument for war, but iu no way interposes it against pence The Rebels can get peace at any lime without touching it. All that is required of them is lhat ibey " shall in gooU faith bow to tbe Cousiiiu ion." Turning to the evening popsrs we nxd Ihe Post: "As of en os the public have had reso:i to exclaim 'God bless Abraham Liucolo,' ihey will utter the benediction with a new zesi ou reading his late niessuge.
