Our remarks upon the above policy, as ap plicable to the present military situation, ap pear to hare mystified and offended some of our cotemporarles. The Star says t "It Is sincerely to be hoped .that the article leu no manner officially Inspired." The Journal of Comment publishes our entire article, and says t "Tmt Abut or. the Potomac bhocld sot Advakce. This Is the strange opinion ex pressed by the Xalkmal JirjnMlem, which claims to be an Administration organ. It ar gues that disaster In an advance movement would be the triumph of .the rebellion that therefore we cannot afford to lncnr a hazard so tremendous, and that as long as the army of tne f otomae ' compels , ine reoeis 10 Keep up their forces and protect Washington, it does all that It ought to do under preaent.circnm stances.' And, according to the same authori ty, the army can menace Richmond ' whenever the rebels reduce their forces sufficiently to enable us to do It.' Who can Interpct this oracle I" The New York Ezprtu publishes a portion of our article and Inquires, " Is this a wind-showing straw i" The Washington Herald correspondent saysi " One of the organs here contlnnes Us oppo sition 10 an aarance oi inearmy, ana questions me competency ot uenerai unrnsiue to com' maud." The appropriate commentary upon the above text Is supplied fay the Richmond Enyvirtri " The next battle between Lee and Bnrnslde may be a Tery decisive one. An overwhelming victory on the part of Lee, and the defence of Washington wonld be gone, and the city may be captured. Such a result should be before the eyes of our soldiers, and be the object of the contest. Upon the next battle, therefore, de- fiends whether the war shall end or drag along n undecided battles, or mere material victo ries." Yes, straws show which way the wind blows; but eves these signal In vain to those who do not heed them, or who do not possess the in telligence to decipher these mnte telegraphs. Let us consult the straws upon the question of the Immediate advance to Richmond, first. Is It not most remarkable that the Journals from which we hare quoted appear to favor an Immediate advance of the army of Gen. Burn side, from which our Richmond cotemporary ex pects such great results to the rebel cause 7 We appeal to the military men now In Washington to say whether It la not one of the first lessons which they are tanght at the schools, or whlf h they learn from their books, " never to do what the enemy wishes you to do, for this reason alone, that be desires it." Comment Is un necessary. Aa our military article of last Monday, which has so puzzled and alarmed our cotemporarles, has also attracted a large share of attention In military and political circles, w c shall republish It In our next Issue. It originally appeared uu au outalde page, and consequently escaped tlte notice of the cursory reader. We commend Its careful perusal by every member of ery branch of the Government. We hare already disclaimed official Inspira tion for the article on this subject, and need hardly repeat the disclaimer, as those who arc determined to force an orgaushlp ou us will not fall to do so In any event. COUHT.MAn.TIAI. OP UBN. POnTKH. The court met at 11 o'clock. The proceedings of i the prevlous,dayiere read and aDDrored. 1 ' I . , I Major Gen. Tope was then called and Slrom,' and examined as follows by the Judge advocate I Qiuiliim. General, will you atate to the court what position you occupy In the military ser vice of the United Slates I Atuietr. I hold a commission aa brigadier general In the regular army and major general of t olnnteers. 0. What was your position and command, ndwhat.th. position of. your operations, on the 27th of August lastf A. Do vou mean mr military position aa commander T o. Yes, sir. A. I commanded the Army of Virginia. which, as originally stated, consisted of the armr coma of McDowell. Banks and Fremont. This, by the S?tb of August, had been rein- torceu oy a portion oi uen. uurasiae-s com mand. Gen. Ilelntzelm'an's corns, and on the morning of the 87th, by half of Gen. Porter's corps. A portion of my command also con sisted of the troops tinder Gen. Sturgls, which had begun to come up to Warrenton Junction. I was myself, on the morning of the 37th, at tne warrenton Junction, tne neia oi tne opera tions of the army at that time covering tho re gion of country between the Warrenton turn- pixe ana ine urauge ana Aiexsuana raiiroau. Q. At what time, on the 27th. did you leave Warrenton Junction, and In which direction did you move ? A. I left a little before midday, I think, and moved east along the railroad, following the movements of Hooker's division toward Ma nassas Junction. O. At what time did Gen. Porter arrive with his command to which yourefer,ora portlonof It, at warrenton junction i .4. I think between the hours of 7 and 10 o'clock, on the morning of August 27th. 0. How many troops had he then with him I A. He reported to me that he had brought Sykes'a division of regulars, numbering 4,500 men, Gen. Pope but the abort actor of (he The court at 11 o'clocl 

THIRTY P. Did you see his troops 1 If so, what waa their condition! A. I onlv aaw them as thev Dossed at a dis tance, and was therefore unable to notice their condition. o. Did von. after leavlne Warrenton Jnnc. tlon" to proceed east, issue an order to Gen. Porter I and, If so, what was Its character! A. I Issued an order to Gen. P. late In the afternoon of the 27th, directing him to move forward with his command at 1 o'clock that night to the position I then occupied at Kettle Rung that If Gen. Morrell with his division was not at Warrenton Junction when he received the order, lo send back and hurry him up, but to come forward with the troops which he had. I gave him some farther directions concerning Gen. Banks, the substance of which only I recollect. An order, dated Brlstow Station, Virginia, August 29th, 1502, at 0.30 p. m., was here handed the witness, which he acknowledged to be the one referred to In his answer. ?. Will you explain to the court the reasons for the urgency of this order, as Indicated In the following words T "It la necessary that you should be here by daylight. I send an officer wltji thla dispatch who will conduct you to tnis puce." A. Yes. sir. General Hooker's division had had a severe fight along the railroad, commenc ing some four miles west of Brlstow Station, and had succeeded In driving the division of General Ewell hack along the road, but without putting It to rout, so that, at dark, Ewell's forces still confronted uooaer's airiaton along the banks of a small stream at Brlstow Station. Just at dark, General Hooker sent me word (which tact waa also reported tome oyuenerai Helntzclman) that he was almost entirely out of ammunition, having but five rounds to the man left, and that, If any action took place in the morning, be would, In consequence, be without the means of making any considerable advance. Aa It was known that Jackson,wlth hla on n and the division of A. P. Hill was at or In the vicinity of Manassas Junction, and near enough to advance to the support of Ew ill, )t was altogether probable that, if he should learu the weakness of our forces there, he would unite and make an attack In the tnom his corps be not turned over to General Porter, bnt that he be allowed to hava it hlniseir, T insat bmii a Inlnl order to Generals Porter .... . - ..(.A .., ,ti.M ..

King's division of McDowell's corps, which I had understood to be, during the greater part of the night of the 28th, on the Warrenton turnpike and "west of the troops under Jackson, had withdrawn to Manasaae, and had, therefore, I feared, left open Jackson's retreat In the direction of Thoroughfare Gap, to which point the main portion of the army of Lee was then tendlnir to reinforce him. I did not desire to pursue, Jackaon beyond the town of Gainesville, as we could not have done so on account ot supplies oi rations tor me men ana lOraKO lur tun uui.es. uj urucr, iucigiuic, .v Generals Porter and McDowell directs them to oursue the route to Gainesville until thev effect a Junction with the forces which were march ing upon uainesvuie irom centrevuie, uuaer Helntzelman.

That when that i auction was formed, as I expected It would lave been very near to Gainesville, the whole commana snouia nan, it Deing, as i saia oeiuro, not feasible for my command In the condition It then was to pursue Jackson's forces further. During the whole morning, tne lorces unuer eiirel and Helntzelman had kept up skirmishing with the rear of Jackson's forces, they retiring In the direction of Gainesville. They were brought to a stand at Groretown, Ithlnk, about eight miles from Centrevllle, perhaps five or six for Gainesville. when I lode on1 the battle-held, which was about noon, having been delayed at Centrevllle, 1 touna mat me troops naa oeen snarpiy en gaged, and were still confronting each other. Gen. Slgel reported to me that he needed rein forcements In the front) that his lines were weak, and that the condition of hla troops re quired their withdrawal from the action. I told him, as I told Gen. II.. who was present on the ground, that I only wished them to maintain thetr positions, as the corps of McDowell and Porter were then on the march from Manassas Junction towards the enemy's right flank, and ought In a very short time to be In such a posi tion as to fall upon that portion of his line. 1 desired them, therefore, only to maintain the nnalttnn that thev ocennied. and await the arri val of Gena. McDowell and Porter. About half past four In the afternoon, finding that neither McDowell nor Porter had made their appear ance upon tne neia, l sent an order to uenerai Porter Informing him of the condition of things on the field, and stated to him that I desired him to push forward and attack the enemy on the flank, and If possible, In the rear, without any delay. This was on the 2Slh. Aa to the ordcra that were sent on the 29th i finding that Gen. Porter did not comply with this order, and receiving a dispatch which he sent to Gens. McDowell and King, stating that be was about to fall back to Manassas Junc tion, becanse he saw clouds of dust, showing that, In his Judgment, the enemy waa advancing on the road that he was occupying, and stating that It appeared to him, from the fire that he baa been listening to on tue Dauie-neia, mat our rorces were retreating ana tne enemy aa vauclng, he had determined to fallback to Ma nassas Junction, and recommended Gens. Mc Dowell and King to send back their trains also. Shortly after receiving this note, purporting to be from Gen. Porter to Gens. McDowell and King, I eent an order to Gen. Porter, directing him. Immediately upon the receiptor the order. to march hla whole command to the field of battle, and to report to me In person for orders, I statea to mm mat i expectea mm to comply strictly with that order. I put It In such form, Ferhaps, as was not entirely courteous, because had understood Gen. Porter, upon two several occasions previous, to have disobeyed the orders that I sent him. The first of these orders was superseded by the one issued to Gen. McDowell subsequently. Q. At what hour was the second order ad dressed to Generals Porter and McDowell f A. I think It was between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning. Q. Waa there an engagement then pending! A. Yes. sir; sharp fighting was going on on the turnpike leading from Centrevllle to War renton. Q. Did the march of Gen. Porter's command, Indicated In that order, lead him towards that battle! A. It did. Porters entire command, at the thev will nteld to 0n. Pope the same support they have eva accorded to me. i am in cusareoi me uiuv w .imum.vu, all I can to reader, your retreat hat become necessary. (ICO. if.

EDITGAIAI SUMMARY. The reader is referred to a letter in another column from Mrs. Secretary Smith. Tho Government refuses to give Gen. titone a command, though U has been asked for by Gen. Booker. Gtn Grant is pressing the rebels Southward. Thty evacuate and move on as our army ap proaches their position. We m7 expect some decisive blows will be struck soon In the South- Vftlt. It will be recollected thst some person stole the will of General Washington sometime t lnce from Fairfax Conrt-Houie. It has the auto graph of the great man himself. It la now said that this Identical will has been no I a to the British Musuein. It should be recovered by oar Government, if possible. A. About nine mite. y. Within what time? A.

A The head of his column reached there at precisely twenty minutes past ten in the morn- Q. Did he at that time, or at any time prior to his arrival, explain to you the reason why he did not obey the order T A, lie wrote me a note, which I think I re ceived on the morning of the 28th, a little before daylight. Counsel Reverdy Johnson. We should like to see the note. Witness. It has been mislaid. I have searched for it. but have been unable to find It. Q, What was the nature of the night) clear or stormy T A. It wa a very clear night, if I recollect aright. Q. Were any obstacles likely lobe encoun tered on the march? A. I have several times made marches with a larger force than Gen. Porter had, during the night. There was some slight obstructions, caused by the wagon trains following In the rear of Gen. Hooker's division, on their way to Manassas, but not sumcient to nave aeiayea for any length of time the passage of artillery. But, even had the roads been entirely blockaded, the railroad track was clear, and along that road had passed the larger portion of Gen. Hooker's Infantry. Gen. Porters infantry could have marched along the same route without any difficulty. Q, Whatever the obstacles which might have existed in point or ract, was u not, (.ana i a en it as a military question,) the duty of Gen.

Porter and ms commana on me way f A, I so understood. Q. I will ask yon now as to whether General Porter obeyed tho last order Issued, which was about 8.60 p. m., on the 29th of Angust t A. Gen. Porter appeared himself on tho field the next morning, with a portion of his com mand; two brigades, however, Gens. Grffln'i and Plat's, were not present, but were reported as being at CentrevtUe. I will say of the latter brigade that, learning a battle was going on in the advance, they marched forward without orders from anybody, and made their appear ance on the ground, and took part in the action late in tne auernoon or the uvtn. 0. Did Gen. Porter obev this order? A, lit did not certainly obev it fullv. If he iiau uuoim it, aja nvuiu usi o ismj, viwugut up to the enemy before 4 o'clock In the evening; uui a. tnat lime no one on ine natue-neia Knew where Porter was. O. Did he obey the second order, issued at 4.30 p. m.,on the 29th of August, directing him io engage ine enemy in ine name, ana u pos sible, In the rear 7 A. He did not; nor did he make any attempt to do eo. as far as my knowledge extends. Q. Will you state the condition of the battle field at that hour, and the Importance of his obedience of this order for the success of your troops. A. Late in tliw afternoon of the 29th, perhaps towards half-past five or six o'clock, about the time that I honed that Gen. Porter would be In his position and be assaulting the enemy on tho flank, and when McDowell had himself arrived with his corps on the field of battle, I directed an attack to be made on tne ten ot tue enemy's line, which was handsomelv done by Helntzel- man's and Reno's corps. The enemy was driven back In all directions, and left a largo part or tue grounawun ms aeaa ana wounaea upon it, In our possession. Had Otn. Porter alien on thejtank of the enemy ut any time vp to figru O'clock inai mgnt, a u was nopea ne vtovut, U if my firm conviction that we thovld Imve d noon that surrender. Objection being made to Its preneut consid eration, the resolution was laid oyer. Mr. TEN EYCffamiouiiced the death of his late colleague, John R. Thompson, who dledou the 12th of September, 180.3. He waa born In PMif1sinMs. nn Ih Qtfi nf Rinf Amha lAfafl and was, therefore, nearly alxty-two years of age when ho died. He left the college. In New Jersey, before graduating, and, entering Into mercantile pursuits, went to China. He took a prominent part In forming the new con stitution of the State of New Jersey, and was active la procuring the abolishment of Imprisonment for debt. Mr. Tea Evck re ferred briefly to the high character of the de ceased Senator aa a man kind and genial among his friends, and always courteous to hla politi cal opponents.
