The Chkoxiclc. D. F. WUIGHT, M. 1)., Editor. Clarksville, Tenn., Dec. 18, 1SS0. rnKi s .oo iar advakce. t i it rtn.it o rut: last mr.s- What Hayes may think; on any public topic matters less at this time than the opinions of any prominent public uran; for Rutherford Hayes is on the verge of retirement into private life, and he retires (we write it with rcirreti covered with the contempt of all parties now efficient in the political transactions of the day. The democracy despises him for the hypocrisy of his early pro fessions, the stalwarts despise him as a man whom they-have kicked and cuffed into sustaining their pro gram, and the liberal republicans despise him for adopting their plat form in word and nullifying it in deed. We say that we make this statement with regret, and we say so with perfect sincerity, for it has a demoralizing influence when a nation despises the men it has ex alted to high position. But it is so, and it was for this reason that we last week reported his message rather in a vein of pleasantry than as a serious matter. But ou reperu- sal we find some matters which we think may be briefly examined with advantage, either because Ihey illus trate the history of the recent presi dency, or because they indicate the points in which President Hayes has surrendered to the less scrupu lous section of his party, who now seem likely to control the nation's policy. ABOUT THE SOUTH. On this head he says : Continued opposition to the fall and free enjoyment i r the nciiui oi ciuzeusn',:'. u' ferntl upon the colored people by the reeeni amendment to the constitution, still pre vails In several of the lute slave-holding states. It has. perhaps, not been manifested in the receut election to any lurge extent in acts of violence or Intimidation. It has, however, bv fraudulent practices in conmsc- tion with the ballots, with the regulations its to the places and manner of voting, na with counting, returning and canvassing t he voles cast, been successful In defeating the exercise of the right preservative of al rights, the right of suffrage, which the con stitutlon expressly confers upon our enfran chised citizens. These are the words of a man who knows that there is no exceptional condition in the south as regards the exercise of the franchise, but cannot bring himself to discard alto gether what his party still treasures up as trump cards to use in political emergencies. The absence of any possible pretext for it compels him to abandon the theory of intimida tion and violence, and he falls back on that of fraud, bribery and false counting. He pretends to no evi dence for this assumption but the loose assertions of a partisan press, and ignores the fact that there are just as heavy charges rife in the political atmosphere as regards the elections in the north. We think it likely that there has been more or less of fraud and bribery in the south, and we are sure lhat there have been oceans of it in Indiana New York and Pennsylvania, and plenty of intimidation in the facto ries of New England, but there Is absolute indecency in a president grounding upon loose reports of this sort, unsustained by evidence, recommendation to congress to pur sue a differential policy as regards one section of the country against which there is no more evidence than there is against the other. ABOUT CIVIL SERVICE REFORM In my former annual messages I have asked the attention of congresw to the urgent necessity ol a reformation of the cl vll service system or ine government. iiy views con ccrni ug the dangers of patronage, or appoi nt menu for personal or partisan cousldera' tions. have been strengthened by my olwervation and experience in the executive office, and I believe these daggers threaten the stability of the government. Abuses so serious in their nature cannot be perma nently tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of ad ministratlve service, us the growth of the country in population increases the number or otnecrs aim placemen employee. The reasons are imperative for the adop tion of fixed rules for the regulation of ap pointments, promotions, and removals, establishing a uniform method, having ex clusively in view. In every instance, the attainment of the best qualifications for the iKtsition in question, tsuch a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of nil citizens, and the most economical anil etli cieut administration of the public business. On this head the president evi dently feels himself to be ou the defensive. He is conscious that there is a cross contradiction be tween his professions at his acces sion to office and his practice when established in it. He commenced his public declarations with the most solemn protests against mak ing office the reward of partisan services, and he has filled the New Orleans custom-house with a gan of the most unscrupulous knaves who aided in constructing the dis gusting tissue of fraud and forgery by which his defeat in the election of 1S7G was converted into a shame loss rape of the highest office of our government. He tries to lay the fault of his inconsistency on con gress, which failed, as he says, to legislate as he advised. But there was no need of congressional inter vention to provide against this scan dal. As president he had absolute control over these appointments; congress had no power over them ; the senate could only refuse to con firm, and certainly could not dictate to him the appointment of any in dividual. The only compulsion which dictated such appointments was the president's own dread of exposure at the hands of the men whocounted him in, should they fail to reap their reward in the form of patronage. Hence the utter break down of every attempt at remedy for the master evil of our political system, the evil w hich has already transformed our government from a republic iuto a bureaucracy, from a government by the people into a government by office-holders. Mr. Hayes would have done bet ter for his reputation as president if he had retired without any further allusions to civil service reform.
