The Message. - We received the Annual Message o f the President but a few hours before our usual time of closing our inside forms, but noticing that it was not the liveliest document that had ever ema nated from the White House, concluded we had better give it to our readers this week, as a week's delay would proba bJynot impart any animation to the prosy production. A number of arti cles intended for this issue have been crowded out. ' We reserve comments upon the lies, sage for a more opportune time. Mr. Tilton's Lecture. The lecture of Mr. Tilton, Friday evening last, on the " Corner Scone of Reconstruction," was one of the best ever heard in this place. Those who missed it sustained an irreparable loea, while those who had the pleasure of hearing it enjoyed one of the highest intellectual treats. We have no doubt that Mr. Tilton is doing much good in the cause of equal rights, and trust he may leave as sound and lasting impres sions elsewhere as he did here. He is an earnest, ardent, eloquent speaker, animating his theme with " thought that breathe and words that burn." Eschewing the manuscript reading " style of ordinary lecturers, and, we may " add, never writing out a lecture, Mr. Tilton speaks with an ease, freedom, eloquence and fervor that captivates and draws his audience into full sym pathy with him. We regret that want of space pre cludes our noting some of the very fine and more important points 'of the lec- ture. JUT. lllton is an auvocam uj iiu. partial Suffrage ; j opposes civil and po- litical discrimination on account of col or ; is not in favor of re-construction on the basis of the Constitutional Amendment, but insists on the right of the blacks to the ballot. ; Universal Suffrage he regaids as Utopian; a thing impossible for the present. Impartial Suffrage was the corner-stone of dura ble reconstruction. Wa notice that the Pittsburgh Com mercial, commenting on the position Mr. Tilton occupies toward the Constitu- difficult person to nnaersiana mat when th8 Amendment was passed thro' -. . . . j,,, i Congress, he endorsed and lauded it. r The Commercial is mistaken. Mr. T1" ton never approved of the Amend ment, and bis present position is en tirely consistent with his past. A Strong Point. Mr. Tilton, in his lecture, denied the right of Congress to submit the Constitu tional Amendment to the late rebel States, as he also denied the'right of those States to ratify an Amendment to the Constitu tion; because if Congress concedes that they are entitled to a voice and vote .in so important a matter as amending the Con stitutor!, which is the supreme law of the land, ihtf consistently, be depri ved the lesser privilege of participation in the more ordinary business of Congress- ional legislation. ,. In conceding they have the higher and vastly more -important Tight, the inferior right is necessarily Im plied to exist He says with truth that the loyal States, who were the life of the Government during the rebellion, and who are as much so now as then, is tbe ' only party who has the right to say upon what terms the conquered rebel States shall be permitted to re-enter the Union. Mr. Tilton is on the right track. - Con- gress must and will face about. The Scientific American to be Greatly Enlarged.

Message of the President of the United Message of the President of the United States to the two Houses of Congress at the Commencement of the Second Session. Fcllmpcitken of the tScnaf and House of Jlrprescntatives : INTRODUCTION. After a brief interval the Congress of the United Stales resumes its legisla tive labors. An all-wise and merciful Providence has abated the pestilence which visited our shores,, leaving iti calamitous traces upon some portions of our country. Pt-ice, order, tran quility, and civil au Jiority have been formally declared to exist throughout the whole of the United States. In all of these States civil authority has superseded the co-er.-ion of arms, and the people, by their voluntary action, are maintaining their goyernments in full activity and complete operation. The enforcement of (he laws is no Ion ger "obstructed in any State by combi nations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial pro ceeding: and the animosities engen dered by the war are rapidly yielding to the benificent influences of our free institutions, and to taetindly effects of unrestricted social and commercial intercourse.' An enure restoration of fraternal feeling must be the earnest wish of every patriot ic heart ; and we will have accomplished our grandest national achievement when, forgetting the sad events of the past, and remem bering only . their instructive lessons, we resume our onwai I career as a free, prosperous people. 

CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY. , In my . message of the 4th of De cember, ISG5, Congiess was informed of the measure which had been insti tuted by the Executive with a view to the gradual restoration of the States in which the insurrection was to their rela tions with the General Government. Provisional Governors had been ap apointed, Contentions called, Govern ors elected, Legislatures assembled, and Senators and Representatives chosen to the Congress of the United States. Courts had been opened for the en forcement of laws long in abeyance. The blockade had -been removed-, custom-house re established, and the inter nal revenue laws put in force, in order that the people miht contribute to the national income. Postal operations had been renewed, aud efforts were be ing made to restore them to their for mer condition of efficiency. The States themselves had been asked to' take ! i .i 1 " I- f. . tin. rC amAnins Dart in me miiu iuli uwu u. Md of thu8 6anction- incp the extinction o! African slavery as one of the legitimate results of our internecine struggle. ADMISSION OF CONGRESSMEN FROM THE REBEL STATES. , Having progressed thus far, the Ex ecutive Department found that it had accomplished nearly all that was within the scope of its constitutional authori ty. One thing, however, yet remained to be done before the work of restora tion could be completed, and that was the admission to Cocgress of loyal Sena tors and Representatives from the States whose peot ie had rebelled B?smbb lilts ittmu i lawful uutboiity of the G neraJ Governmefl. This question devolved -upon the respective Houses, which, bv the Constitution, are made the iudces of the elecaons, returns and nualifieations ot the:r own members; and its consideration at once engaged the attention of Congress. ACTION OF THE EXECUTIVE. In the meantime, the Executive partmentno other plan having been proposed by Congrtss continued its efforts to perfect, as f. r as was practica ble, the restoration of the proper rela tions between the citizens of -the res pective States, the : States, and the Federal Government, extending, from time to time, as the public interest seemed to require, the judicial, revenue anA uncial svfctem of the country. With the advice and consent of the Senate, the necessary officers were ap imil. and aDcroDriations made by I Congress for the payment of their sala j ries. The proposition to amend the Federal Constitution, so as to prevent the existence of sh very within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction, wrs ratified by the requisite number of States; and on the 18th day of Dece mber, 1805, it was officially declared to have become valid as a part of the Constitution of the United States. All the States in which the insurrection had existed promptly amended their Constitution, so as to maxethem conform lo the great change thus effected in tbe rganic law of the land ;" declared null tud void all ordi nances and laws of secession; repudia ted all cretended deb s and obligations created for the revolutionary purposes of the insurrection ; aud proceeded, in good faith, to the er. .ctment of meas ures for the protection and ameliora tion of the condition of the colored race. Congress, however, yet hesita ted to admft any cl these blates to representation ; and it was not until towards the close oi uie eigum moum of the session that . h exception was made in favor of Tennessee, by the admission of her SeV tors and Repre sentatives.

REBEL STATES NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS CONQUERED TERRITORIES. al thonch age, af. hair hat ai ling 4" , . It is true, it has b-n assumed that the existence of the tetates was terrain-: ated by the - rebellious act of their and that the insurrection having been guppr.iised, they were thenceforward to be considered merely as conquered territoi ies. The Legisla tive. Executive and Judicial Depart ments of the Goverrment have, how ever, with great diet rnctness and uni form consistency, rr'used to 'sanction an assumption so incompatible with the nature of our r publican system, 'and with the profesd objects of war. Throughout the recent legisla tion of CoDgress, the undeniable makes itself apparent , that these political communiiu are nothing than States of this Union. At very commencement of the rebellion,' each House declared, with a unanimi ty as remarkable as it was significant, that the war was not "waged, upon part, in any spirit of oppression, for auy purpose of conquest or subju tion, nor purpose of oyerthrowing f tumble. interfering with the rights or eetab? lished institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof, and to pre serve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired ; and that as soon as these objects" were "accomplished, the war ought to cease." In sosie in stances, Senators were were permitted to continue their legislative functions, while in other instances, Representa tives, were elected and admitted to seats after their States had formally declared their right to withdraw from the Union, and were endeavoring to maintain that right by force of arms. All of the States whose people were in insurrection, as States, were included in the apportionment of the direct tax of twenty millions of dollars annually laid upon the United States by the act approved 5th August, 1861. Congress, by the act of March 4, 1862, and by the apportionment of representation thereunder, also recognized their pres ence as States in the Union ; and they have, for judicial purposes, been. divi. ded into districts, as States alone can be divided. Tbe same recognition ap pears in the recent legislation in refer ence to Tennessee, which evidently rests upon the fact that the functions of the State were not 'destroyed by the re bellion, but merely suspended ; and that principle is of course applicable to those States which, like Tennessee, at tempted to renounce their places in the Union. The action of the Executive Depart meat of the Government upon this subject has been equally definite and uniform, and the purpose of the war was specifically stated in the Procla mation issued by my predecessor on the 23d day of September, 18G2. It was then solemnly proclaimed and de clared, that "hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the ob ject of practically restoring the consti tutional relation between the United States and each of the States and peo ple thereof, in which States that rela tion is or may be suspended or disturb ed." The recognition of the States by the Judicial Department of the Govern ment has also been clear and conclu sive in all proceedings affecting them as Sutes, had in the Supreme, Circuit and District Courts. NO DISLOYAL MEMBERS WILL BE ADMITTED. : In the admission of Senators and Representatives from any or all of the States, there can be no just ground of apprehension that persons who are dis loyal will be clothed with the power of legislation ; for this could not happen when the Constitution and laws are en forced by a vigilant and faithful Con gress. Each House is made the 'judge of the elections, returns, and qualifica tions of its own members," and may, "with a concurrence of two-thirds, ex pel a member." When a Senator or Representative presents his certificate of election, he may at once be admit ed or rejected ; or, should there be any question to his eligibility, his credent ials may be referred to for investiga tion for the appropriate committe. If admitted to a seat, it must be upon ev idence satisfactory to the House of which he thus becomes a member, that j.he possesses the requisite constitution al and legal quaimcaiions. ii reruseu admission as a member for want of due allegiance to the Government, aod re- turned to his constituents, they are admonished that none but persons loy al to the United States will be allowed a voice in the Legislative Councils of the Nation, and the political power and moral influence of Congress, are thus effectively exerted in the interests of loyalty to the Government and fidelity to the Union. Upon this question so vitally affecting the restoration of the Union and the permanency of. our present form of government, my con victions heretofore expressed, have un dergoue no change ; but, on the. con trary, their correctness has been con firmed by reflection ana ame.. ii me admission of loyal members to seats in the respective Houses of Congress was wise and expedient a year ago, it is no less wise and expedient now. If this anomalous condition" is right now if, in the exact condition of these States at the present time, it is lawful to ex clude them from representation, I do not see that the question will bechang ed by the efflux of time. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, the right of representation will be no stronger the right of exclusion will be no weaker.

This would consum mate the work of restoration, and ex ert a most salutarv influence in the re- establishment of peace, harmony and fraternal feeling.

The war having terminated, and with it all occasion for the exercise of powers ot doubtful constitutionality, we should hast en to brine legislation within the bounda ries prescribed by the Constitution, and to return to tne ancieni lanamarics eciaousn- ed br our fathers for the guidance of sue- cecdinir irenerations . "The .Constitution which at any time exists, until changed bv an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all." "If. in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the con stitutional power be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amend ment in the way in which tne Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurption; for "it :s the customary weapon Kir shirh frae governments are destroyed." Washington spoke these words to his countrymen, when, followed by their love t.A voluntarily retired from the CATfR nf Tuihlie life "To keep all things within the nale of our constitution al powers, and cfceris!. the Federal Union as the only rock of safety," were prescrib ed bv Jefferson as rules of action to endear to his "countrvmen the true principles their -Constitution, and promote a union sentiment and action equally auspicious their happiness and safety.' Jackson held thas the action of the General Government should always be strictly confined to the sphere of its appropriate duties, and justly t-HW ' aetaeara MlMtupreMBte!rae pes vs xuca Artut. and forcibly urged that our Government is not to be maintained nor our Union preserved "by invasions of the rights and powers of the several States. : In t r. at tempting to make our Gmeral Go. '-n-ment strong, we make it weak. Its true strength consists in leaving individuals and States as much as possible to themselves; in milking itself felt, not in its power, but in its benefioence ; not in its control, but in its protection; cot in binding the States more closely to the centre, but leaving each to move unobstructed in its proper constitutional orbit" These are the teach ings of men whose deeds and services have made them illustrious, and who, long since withdrawn from the scenes of lifo, have left to their country the rich legacy of their example, .their wisdom and their patriotism. Drawing fresh inspiration from their lessons, let us emulate them in love of country and respect for the Con stituton and the laws. REPORT SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. TRY. The report of the Secretary of the Treas ury affords much information respecting the revenue and commerce of the country. His views upon the currency, and with reference to a proper adjustment of our revenue system, internal as well as im post, are commended to the careful con sideration of Congress. In my lost annual message I expressed my general views upon these subjocts. I need now only call attention te the necessity of carrying into every department of the government a system of rigid accountability, thorough retrenchment, and wise econemy. With no exceptional nor unusual, expenditures, the oppressive burdens of taxation can be lessened by such a modification of our rev enue laws as will be consistent with the public faith, and the legitimate and neces sary wants of the government. " The report presents a much moro satis factory condition of our finances than one year ago the most sanguine could have anticipated. During the fiscal year end ing the 30th of June, 1865, the last year of the war, the public debt was increased $941,902,537, and on the 31st of October, 1863, it amounted to $2,740,854,750. On the 81st day of October, 1866, it had been reduced to $2,551,310,006, the diminution, during a period of fourteen months, com mencing September 1, 1865, and ending October 31, 1866, having been $206,379, 565. In the last annual report on the stale of the finances, it was estimated that during the three quarters of the fiscal year ending the 30th of June last, the debt would be increased $112,194,947. During that period, hewever, it was reduced $31, 196,387, the receipts of the year having been $89,905,905 more, and the expendi tures $200,529,235 less than tbe estimates. Nothing could more clearly indicate than these statements the extent and availabili ty of the national resources, and the rapid ity and safety with which, under our form of government, great military and naval establishments can be disbanded, and ex penses reduced from a war to a peace foot ing. ' ' During the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1866, the receipts were $558,032, 620, and the expenditures $520,750,940, leaviDg an available surplus of $37,281, 680. It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1867, will be $475,001,386, and that the expenditures will reach the sum of $316, 428,078, leaving in the Treasury a surplus of $158,633,308. For the fiscal year end ing June 30. 1808, it is estimated that the receipts will amount to $436,000,000, and that the expenditures will be $350,247,64l showing an' excess of $85,752,359 in favor of the Government. These estima tor! rweinta mav be diminished by a re duction of excise and import duties ; but after, all necessary reductions shall have heen'made. the revenue of the present and of following years will doubtless be suffi cient to cover all legitimate charges upon the Treasurv. ' and leave a lanre annual surplus to be applied to the payment of tn principal oi tne ueou mere scum now to be no good reason why taxes may not be reduced as the country advances in nonnlation and wealth, and yet the debt be extinguished within the next quarter of a century.

Fortifications on. the coast and frontier have received, or are being prepared for more powerful ar. maments; lake surveys and harbor and river improvements are in course of ener getic prosecution. Preparations have been majje for the payment of the addiQonal bounties authorized during the recent ses sion of Congress, under such regulations as will protect the Government from fraud, and secure in the honorably discharged soldier the well earned reward of his faith fulness and gallantry. More than six thousand maimed soldiers have received artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus;, and forty-one national cemeteries, contain ing the remains of 104,526 Union soldiers, hv already been established. The total estimate of military appropriations is 205.669. ... ... - -! REPORT THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY. c It is stated in the report of the Secreta rv of the Naw that the naval force at this time consists of two hundred and sev enty-eight vessels, armed with two thous and three hundred and fifty-one guns. Of these, one hundred and fifteen vessels car rying one thousand and twenty-nine guns, are in commission) aisiriouieu. bikby among seven squadrons. The number of : : Vi . .nc a rwl bit men in sefviue is iaiiijcii - hundred. Great activity and vigilance have been displayed by all the squadrons, and their movements have been judicious ly and efficiently arranged in such a man ner as would best promote American com merce, and protect the rights and interests of our countrymen .abroad. The yefseU unemployed are unaergonii; rcjiono, hud up until their services are required. Most of the iron clad neei is at iK-aguo i land, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, place which, until decisive action snouia be taken by Congress, was selected by the Secretary of the Navy as the most eligible location for that cl ass of vessels. It is im portant that a suitable public station should be provided for the iron clad fleet. It is intended that tnese vessels wnu proper condition lor any emergency, and itisdesiraDie imuine Din accepiuig licoguc Island for naval- purposos, wUico passea the House of Representatives at its iai sesion, should receive final action at an early period, in order that mere may oe suitable public station for this class of ves sels, as well as a navy-yard of area suffici ent for the wants ot tne service on Delaware river. The jNaval rension lunu amount to $11,750,000, having been in creased $2,750,000 during 'the year. The expenditure of the Department for the fis cal year ending 80th of June last were 543,324,526, and the. estimates for the coming year amount to $23,568,436. At tention is invited to the conditon of our seamen, und the importance of legislative measures for their relief and improvement. The suggestions in behalf of tnis deserv ing class of our fellow-cltlzens are earnest ly0 recommended to the favorable atten tion of Congress. REPORT OF THE POSTMASTER GENERAL. of of w The renort of the Postmaster General presents a most satisfactory condition the postal service, and submits recommen dations which deserve the consideration Congress. The revenues of the Depart ment for the year ending June SO, 1866, were $14,886,986, and the expenditures $15,852,079, showing an excess-of the lat ter of $965,093. In anticipation of this deficiency, however, a special appropria tion was made by Congress in the act ap proved July 28, 1866. Including the standing appropriation of $700,000 for free mail matter, as a legitimate portion of the revenues yet remaining unexpended, the actual deficiency for the past year is only $265,093 a sum within $51,141 of the amount estimated in the annual report 1864. The decrease of revenue compared with the previous year was one and one fifth per cent, and the increase of expend itures, owing principally to the enlarge ment of the mail service in the South, was ,1 Oct S "TUCTANTSaRMON, No. 5, Market twelve per cent On the 30th of June last, there were in operation six thousand nine hundred and thirty mail routes with an aggregate length of one hundred and eighty thousand nine hundrod and twen ty-one miles, an asrfcregate annual trans portation of seventy one million eight hundred and thirty-seven thousand nine hundred and fourteen miles, and an aggre gate annual cost, including all expendi tures, of $8,410,181. The length of rail road routes, is thirty-two thousand and ninety-two miles, and the annual trans portation thirty million six hundred and nine thousand foun hundred and sixty seven miles. The .length of steamboat routes is fourteen thousand three hundred and forty-six miles, and th3 annual trans portation three million four hundred and eWen thousand nine hundred and sixty two miles. The mail service is rapidly increasing throughout the whole country, and its steady extension in the Southern States indicates their constantly improv ing condition. The growing importanco of the foreign service also merits attention. The Postoffiee Depa tment of Great Brit ain and our own have agreed upon a pre limary basis for a new Postal Convention, which it is believed will grove eminently beneficial to the commercial interests of the United Suites, inasmuch as it con templates a reduction of postage with all countries to and from which correspond ence is transmitted in the British mails or in closed mails through the United King dom : the establishment of uniform and reasonable chnrges for the sea and terri torial transit of correspondence in closed mails; and an allowance to each Postof fiee Department of the right to use all mail communications established under the authority of the other for the dispatch of correspondence, either in open or closed mails, on the same terms as those appli cable to the inhabitants of the country providing the means of transmission, REPORT THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. The renort of the Secretary of the Inte rior exhibits the condition of those bran ches of the publje service which are com mitted to his supervision. During the last fiscal year, four million six hundred and twentv-nina thousand three hundred and twelve acre public land were dispos ed of, one million eight hundred and ninety-two thousand five hundred and sixteen acres of which were entered, un der the homestead act The policy ong- inallv adorjted relative to the public lands has undergone essential modifications. Immediate revenue, and not their rapid settlement, was tho cardinal feature of our land system. Long experience and ear nest discussion have resulted in mo tuu virtinn that the earlv development of our agricultural resources, and the diffusion of an energetic population over our vast territory, are objects of far greater impor tance to the national growth and prosper ity than the proceeds of the sale of the land to the highest bidder in open mar ket. The preemption laws confer upon the pioneer who complies with' the terms they impose the privilege of purchasing a limited nortion of "unoffered lands" at tho minimum price. Thnhomestead en act- menu relieve the settler from the pay ment of purchase money, and secure him a permanent homo, upon the condition of residence tor a term ot years, auis uuer al tiolicv invites emigration from the old, and from the more crowded portions of the new world. Its propitious Jesuits are undoubted, and will be more signally manifested when time shall have given it a wider development. . INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS. Congress has made liberal grants of pub lic land to corporations, in aid of the con structions of railroads and other internal improvements. Should this policy here after prevail, more stringent provisions will be required to secure a faithful appli cation of the fund. The title of the lands should not pass, by patent or otherwise, but remain in the hands of the Govern ment and subject to its control until some portion of the road has actually been built. Portions of them might then, from time to time, be conveyed to the corporation, but never in a greater ratio to the whole quantity embraced by the grant, than the completed parts bear to the entire length nf tha nroiected improvement. This re striction would not operate to the preju dice of any undertaking conceived in good faith ana execuiea wua reasuuuun; ; gy, as it is the settled practice to withdraw from market the lands falling within the opperation of such grants, and thus to ex clude the inception ef a subsequent ad verse right. A breach of the conditions which Congress may deem proper to im pose should work a forfeiture of -:lam to tho lands so withdrawn but conveyed, and of title to tho landi conveyed which remain unsold. Operations on tho several lines of the Pacific Kailroad have been prosecuted with unexampled vigor, and success. Should no unforseen causes of delay occur, it is confidently anticipated that this great thoroughfare will be completed be fore the expiration of the period designa ted by Congress. ' " PENSIONS. During the last fiscal year the amount paid to pensioners , including the expen ses of disbursement, was thirteen million four hundred and fifty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninetv-six dollars; and fifty thousand one hundred and seventy seven nrftoes were added to the pension rolls. The entire number of pensioners June 30, 18C6, wasone hundred and twenty-six thousand seven hundred and twen ty two. ' This fact furnishes melancholy and striking proof of the sacrifice made to vindicate the constitutional authority of the Federal Government, and to main tain inviolate the integrity of the Union. They impose upon us corresponding obli gations. It is estimated that thirty-three million dollars will be required to meet the exigencies of this branch of the ser vice during the next fiscal year, TREATISE WITH INDIANS. Treaties have been concluded with the Indians who, enticed into armed opposi tien to our Government at the outbreak the rebellion, have unconditionally sub mitted to our authority, and manifested an earnest der ire for a renewal f - friendly relations. . : 1 ' m PATENTS. Buring the year ending September 30, eight thousand seven hundred and six teen patents foi useful inventions and de signs were issued, and that date the . bal ance, in the Treasury to the credit of the Patent fund was two hundred and twenty eight thousand two hundred and., ninety seyen dolliir.. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER LEVERS. As a subject upon which dependo an immense amount of - the production and commerce of the country, I recom mend to Congress such legislation as may be necessary for the preserva tion of the levees of the . Mississippi river. It is a matter of national im portance" that early steps should be ta ken not only to aau to me euicieocy of these barriers against destructive inundations, for the removal of all ob structions to the free and safe naviga tion of that great channel of trade und commerce. - 1 THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. of 6f of The District of Columbia, under existing laws, is not entitled to that representation in the- National Coun cils- which, from our earliest history. has been uniformly accorded to each Territory established from time to time within our limits, it maintains pecu liar relations to Congress, to whom Constitution has granted the' power exercisine exclusive legislation over the seat of government. Our fellow citizens residing in the District,- whose interests are .thus confided to the spe cial guardianship of Congress, exceed in number the population of several our Territories, and no. just reason perceived why a delegate ot tneir choice should not be admitted ' to seat in the House of Bepreeentatives. No-mode, seems so appropriate ': and effectual of enabling them to make known their peculiar condition .and wants, and of securing the local legis la tion adapted to them. I therefore recommend the passage of a law au thorising the electors of the District of Columbia to choose a delegate, to allowed the tame rights and privileges as a delegate representing . territory The increasing enterprise aod iapid progress of improvement in the Dis- i trict-are highly gratifying, and 1 trust that the efforts of the- municipal au thorities to promote the prosperity the national metropolis will receive the efficient and generous co-operation Congress.

The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture reviews the operations of his department during the. past year, and asks the aid of Congress in its efforts to encourage those States which, scourged by war, are now earnestly en gaged in the reorganization of domes tic industry. OUR FOREIGN COMBINATIONS. It is a subj?ct of congratulation th.it no foreign comKiuations against our domestic peace and uafety.or our legiti mate influence among Mie nations. have been formed oratiempird. While sentiments of reconciliation, loyalty, and patriotism have increased at home, a more just consideration ot our nation al character and right has been mani fested by foreign nations. INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH. The entire success of the Atlantic Telegraph between the coact of Ire land and tne frovince ot .Newfound land, is an achievement which has been justly celebrated in bpth hemispheres as tbe opening of an era in ine pro gress of civilization. J'here is reason to expect that equal success will at tend, and even greater results follow, the enterprise for connecting the two Continents through the Pacific Ocean by the projected line of telegraph be tweeu Kamchatka and the Russian possessions in America. FOREIGN CONVICTS. The resolution of Congress protest ing against pardons by foreign Govern ments of persons convicted of infamous offences, on condition of emigration to our country, has been communicated to the States with which we maintain intercourse,-and the practice, so justly the subject of complaint on our part, has not been renewed. CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CZAR. The congratulations of Congress to the Emperor of Russia, upon his escape from attempted assassination, have been presented to that humane and enlightened ruler, and received by him with expressions of grateful appreciation. IMMIGRATION OF FREEDMEN. The Executive, warned of an attempt by Spanish American adventurers to induce the emigration of freedmen of the United States to a foreign country, protested against the project aa one which, if onsumated, would reduce them to a bondage even more oppres sive than that from which they have just been releived. Assurance has been received Trom the Governor of the State in which the plan was matured, that the proceeding will meet neither its encouragement nor approval. It is a question worthy of your considera tion, whether our laws upon this sub ject are adequate to the prevention or punishment of the crime thus meditated. MEXICAN AFFAIRS. of In the month of April last, as Con gress is aware, a friendly arrangement was made between the Emperor of France and the President ol the United States for the withdrawal from Mexi co of the French expeditionary mili tary- forces. This withdrawal was to be'effected in three detachments, the first of which, it was understood, would leave Mexico in November, dot past, the second in March, next, mid the third and Ia9t, in November, 1SCG. Immediately upon tbe completion of the evacuation, the rrencu bovern- inent was to assure the same attitude of non-intervention in regard to Mexi co, as is held by the Government of the Unitey States. Kepeated assurances haye been given by the tmperor, since that agreement, that he would com plete the promised evacuation witnin the period mentioned, or sooner. ; It was reasonably expected tnai me proceedings thus contemplated would produce a crisis oi great political inter est in the Republic of Mexico, .lue newly appointed Minister of theUnlted States, Mr. Campbell, was therefore sent forward, on the 9th day of No vember last, to assume his - proper functions as Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States to that Republic. It was also thought expedient that he should be attended in tbe vicinity of Mexico by the Lieutenant General of the Army of the United Slates, with the view of- obtaining such information as might Le impcrtapt to determine the course to be pursued- by - the .United Slates in establishing and maintaining necessary and proper intercourse with the Republic ot Mexico. Leepiy in terested in the cause of liberty and humanity it seemed an obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever iduu ence we possessed for the restoration and permanent establishment in that country of 8domstic and republican form of governmetrt. Such was the condition 'of. affairs in regard to Mexico, when, ou the 23d of November last, otncnl information was received from Paris that the Emperor. of France bed some time - before decided not to withdraw a detachment of his forces in the "month of Novem- bei past, according to engagement, but that this dci-don wm made with tho purpose of withdrawing the whole- of those forces la thn ensuing spring Of this determination, however, the Uoi ted State had not received any notice or intim-'K:on ; .nd bo soon as tne in formation ras receive! by the Govern ment, care wan taken to make its dis sent to the Emperor of France.' I cannnol - foregoe the hope that France will rf consider the subject, and adopt soma resolution in regard to the evacuation of Mexico which will con form as nearly a practible with the ex isting engagement, and meet' the just expectations of the United "States. The paper relating lo tne suhject will be laid before you. It w believed that with the evacunHan of Mextco by the expeditionary forces, no subject for se riom difference between France and the United States would remain. The expressions of the Eemperor and peo ple of r ranee warrant a nope mai ine traditionary friendship between -- tbe two countries might in that cse be ie newed and permanently restored. 

INTERNATIOAL INDEMNITY. A claim of a citizen of the United States for indemnit "for spoliations committed on the high seas by - the French authorities; in the exercise of a belligerent power against. Mexico, has been met by the Government of France with a preposition to dofer' settlement until a mutual convention for the ad justment of all claims of citizens and su Meets of boin c)uitr.tw, arising out of the recent wars on this continent, shall be agreed upon by the two coun tries. - The suggestion h no1 deemed unreasonable, but it belongs to Con gress to direct tho manner in which claims for. indemnity by foreigners, as well as by ci'iJieris of the United States, arising out of the late oivil war, shall be adjudicated and determined. I haye no doubt that the subject of all such claims will engage your attention at a convenient and proper time. THE ANGLO REBEL PIRATES. of is a be . of of 1 ' It is a matter of regret that no con siderable advance has been towards an adjustment of th' differences between the United States and Great Britain, arising out oi the depredation upon our national commerce and other tress passes committed during our civil war by British subjects, in yiolation f in ternational law and treaty obligations. The delay, however, my be believed to have resulted in no small degree from, the domestic situation of Great Britain. An entire change of ministry occurred in that country during the last session of Parliament. The attention of the new ministry was called to the subject at an early day, and there Is some rea son to expect that it will now be con sidered in a becoming and friendly spir it. The importance of an early dispo sition of tbe question cannot be exag gerated. Whatever might be the wish es of tbe two Governments, it is mani fest that good will and friendship be tween the tiro countries cannot be es tablished until a reciprocity, in the practice of good faith and neutrality should be restored between tbe respect ive nation. vnio. occeaer. JldT-i,:'.; THE FENIANS. On the Cth of June last, in violation of our neutrality taws, a military expedition and enterprise against tbe British Jsorth American Colonies wa? projected and at tempted to bo carried on within tho terri tory and jurisdiction of the United States. In obedienco to the obligation imposed upon the Executive by tho Constitution, to see that the laws are faithfully execu ted, all citizens were warned, by procla mation, against taking pari in or aiding such unlawful proceedings, and the prop er civil, military and naval officers were directed to take all necessary measures for t'ae enforcement of the laws. The expe dition failed, but it has not been with out its oainful coneouoncesv Some of our citizens who, it was alleged, were engaged in the expedition,- were captured, ana have been brought to tritl, as for a cap ital offense in the Province of Canada. Judgement and sentence of death have been pronounced against some, while oth ers have been acquitted. Fully believing in tho maxim of government, that severity of civil punishment for miuided persons who have engaged in revolutionary at tempts which have disastrously failed, is unsound and unwise, Jch representations i have been made to the British tiovern ment, in behalf of the convicted persons, as, being sustained by an enlightened and humane iudgment, will, it ishsped, induce in their cases au exercise of clemency and a judicious amnesty to all who were en gaged iu the movement Counsel has been employed by the Government to de fend citizens of the United States on trial for capital offenses in Canada, and a dis continuance of the prosecutions which were instituted in the courts of the Uni ted ii Lutes against those who took part in the expedition, has been directed. I have regarded tho expedition as not only political in its nature, but as also in a great measure foreign from the United Slates in its causes, character, and objects. The attempt was understood to be made in sympathy with an insurgent party in Ire land, and, by striking at a British Prov ince on this Continent, was designed to ail in obtaining redress for political griev ances which, it was assumed, the people of Ireland had suffered at the hands of the British Government during a period of several centuries. ' The persons engag in it were chiefly natives ot that country, some of whom had, while others had not, become citizens of the United States un der our general'laws of naturalization. Complaints of misgovernment in Ireland continually engage the attention of the British nation, and so great an -agitation is now prevailing in Ireland that the British Government have deemed it nec essary to suspend the of" habeas corpus in that country. These circumstances must necessarily njpdify the opinion which we might otherwise have entertained in re gard to an expedition expressly prohibited by our neutrality laws. So long as those remain upen our statute books, tbey should be faithfully executed, and if they operate harshly, unjustly, or oppressively, Congress alone oan, apply the remedy, by their modification or repeal. THE EASTERN QUESTION. "Political and commercial interests of the United States -are not unlikely to be affected in some degree by events which are transpiring in the eastern regions of Europe, and the time seems to have come when our Government ought to have a proper diplomatic . representation in Greece. RIGHTS OF NATURALIZED CITIZENS. The"Gov'rnmcnt has claimed for all persons not eonvicta'd, or accuse J, or sus peeled of crime, an abvilute political right of self-expatriation,, and a choice of new national allegiance. 'Most of the Europe an States have dissented from' the princi ple, and have claimed a ri-'ht to hold such of their subjects as hava immigrated to and been naturalized in the United States, and afterward returned on transient vis its to their native countries,- to the per formance of military service iu like man ner as resident subjects. Complaints arising from the claim in this respect made by foreign Mates, have heretofore been ma&-1 ters of controversy between tho United States and some of the European Powers, and tho irritation consequent upon the failure to settle this question,-increased during tho wur in -which Pruia, Italy and Austria "werff r(jcantlyengaged. While Great Britain' has Dever acknowl edged tho right of expatriation,.. sho tiite not practically insisted upon it. p iIMtl,1 has bees equally forbearing ;'snJ cruesia has proposed a compromise, which, al though, evincing increased liberality, has not been accepted by tho -United States. Peace is now prevailing everywhere in Europe, and the present saeiui' tu. be a favorable' tiins for an assertion by- Con gress of the principle, so long maintained, .by the Executive Department, that natu ralization by one State fully exempts the native-born subject of any other Stato from the pcrformanceof .military, sorvice unSi r any foreign govern men t, i long as he does not voluntarily renounce its rights and benefits. ; - :
