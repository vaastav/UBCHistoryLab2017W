caxal treaty discussed. iS ARGUMENT FOR RATIFICATION MADE BY SENATOR CULLOM. ABSOLUTE CONTROL OP AN ISTHMIAN WATERWAY SECURED TO THIS COUN TRT—SENATOR BACON STATES HIS OBJECTIONS. Washlnfirton, Dec 11. — Two speeches were uja^c on the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty In the eiecutlve session of the Senate to-day, one by Senator Culiom. the prospective chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. In support of It. and tie other by Mr. Bacon, of Georgia, In opposition. Senator Cullom congratulated the Senate and the country on the fact that there are two things in connection with the new treaty on which, he said, practically ail are agreed. Ona of these is th« desirability of superseding the Clayton- Bulwer Treaty and the other the necessity for the construction of an Isthmian canal. He con terded that the new treaty . radically changes the conditions presented by the first Hay- Paancefots Treaty, clearly relieving It of the necessity of such an amendment as that made to the old treaty on the sugges tion of Senator Davis, because the treaty itself would permit the United States under international law to own, manage and defend the canal In any way that It may choose. In other words, he added. In a war with Great Britain or with any other power the treaty would be suspended, under the law which gov erns nations, until the war ended, when It would be revived and again enforced. He dwelt on the fact, which he said was the most Important circumstance to be considered, that the new treaty supersedes and abrogates the Clayton - Bulger Convention of ISSO, and for this reason would be of untold value to the country. . . MIGHT BE CLOSED IN TIME OF WAR. He admitted that the new treaty retains the general principle of neutralization, as did the original Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, but he urged that It does not re-enact or keep alive any of the provisions of the treaty of ISSO. While it retained the doctrine of neutralization, the pro vision making that retention applied to all na tions alike, but to none of them for any longer. time than they observe the regulations pre scribed by the United States. When they should fail In this observance we could close the canal under the terms of the treaty. All nations would be treated on terms of fairness and equality by allowing all. to use the canal In time of peace and shutting out all in time of ■war in case it should be found desirable to do 60. In short, Senator Cullom urged that there Is no provision In the pending convention which would interfere with the right of the United States to close the waterway to any belligerent power. He contended that the provision In regard to policing the canal applied only to its control in time of peace and not In time of war. Then, the United States being the owner of the prop erty, under the terms of the treaty, it could con trol It with either the police or a military power as it might choose for the protection of our gov ernment and its property. Referring to the fourth article of the treaty, which was not contained in the old treaty. Sena tor Culiom held that the provision regarding the change of sovereignty would make no real dif ference in the conditions, as the same rule would apply if the sovereignty of the country traversed by the canal should come to the United States". Under that Improbable condition the canal could be closed in case of war, just as It could be In case the sovereignty should remain where it r.ow is, as he predicted it would remain. He quoted from President Rooseveit'e Message, say ing that the United States is not seeking to extend its borders, and adding that the chances were ten to one that this country would not seek to secure new territory in that direction. As a matter of fact, he said, the people do not want more territorj', but are content to leave the boundaries as they exist at present. 

SENATOR BACON'S OBJECTIONS. Mr. Bacon replied to the speech made yester day by Senator Lodge, He summed up his ob jections in the statement that he could not freely accept any treaty which does not place the isth mian canal entirely under American auspices and American control. This, he said, the pend ing treaty does not do, nor does it do anything like it. It did net by long odds accomplish what had been accomplished by the Senate amend ments made to the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty at the !sst session of Congress. The Davis amend ment, he said, had abrogated all the objectiona ble provisions of that treaty as negotiated, and it did not matter what provisions there were In the agreement so long as the United States was authorized, as it was by the Davis amendment, to secure the safety and maintenance of the canal by its own forces. That amendment had given this country a free hand to do what was neces sary tor the protection and -defence of the canal, whereas the present treaty carries all the re strictions which were originally contained in the old treaty, leaving out the modifications of the Davis amendment. He Bteo said that the treaty reproduces the re- Btrictions o? the old Suez Canal treaty, which had b*<-ri Incorporated in the original conven tion H<=- charged that thetse restrictions had been copied almost verbally from the old treaty, the only material change being In the omission of the 'words 'in time of war as In time or peace" from Rule 1 of the Suez Canal agree ment. This omipsion did not, in his opinion, change the character of the agreement. The only reply " he said, "which the advocates of the treaty make to criticisms, is that the canal would be under full control of the United States in tiire of war but this is no more true now than und«»r the old treaty, and it is a strange thing that all the provisions refer to the control of the canal in war. notwithstanding It is con tended here that in that contingency the re moval of this phrase places the canal under our absolute control." 

CRITICISFS RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE. He said the war restrictions of the treaty *ere entirely inconsistent with the assertions of Senator Lodge that this country should say who ehould use the tanal and who should not in case of hostilities. He contended that the cniy power given to the United States which was not given to Great Britain waa found in the laEt sentence of regulation No. 2. providing that "the United States shall be at liberty to maintain such military police along the canal as may be necessary to protect it against law lessness and disorder." This, he said, was not sufficient to make the canal an American in stitution, and If the Davis amendment had t*en necessary to render the original treaty ac r<Lptab'.e it was equally necessary In this In stance. He considered the pending treaty every whit as objectionable as the treaty of last ses ■ PERMIT* NO SUBSTITUTION — — ASK FOR CARL H. SCHULTZ' PURE and CORRECT MINERAL WATERS TAKE NO OTHER. Carl H.

SCHULTZffI 430 to 444 First Avenue, N. Y. • üBIkJ Established 1*42 sion. He quoted the fourth article of the pend ing treaty, as follows: It is agreed that no change of territorial sov ereignty or of international relations of the country or countries traversed by the before mentioned canal shall affect the general prin ciple of neutralization or the obligation of the high contracting parties under the present treaty. The effect o* this provision he paid, was In evitably to surrender control of the canal belt in case the ownership of the soil embraced in it should pass to the United States. He pointfl out that this restriction had not been incorpo rated in the first treaty, and said it was en tirely out of place In the revised agreement. In deed, he thought there would be almost as much objection to guaranteeing neutrality on land owned by the United States on the Isthmus of Panama as on land held by a canal cropping the peninsula of Florida. In conclusion, Mr. Bacon announced that while he had no intention of voting for the treaty, hf would do nothinpr to obstruct Its ratification. A laree number of unopposed nominations were confirmed in the executive session. The open session lasted only twenty minutes, and was devoted to unimportant routine business. 

DEMOCRA TIC SENA TE CA UCUS ALL THE SILVER REPUBLICANS AND POPULISTS PRESENT. MR. M'LAURIN ABSENT— COMMITTEE ASSIGN' MENTS DISCUSSED— NEITHER SIDE WANTS MR. WELLINGTON. Washington, Dec. 11. — The Democratic Sena tors to-day held their first caucus of the present session. The purpose was to consider commit tee assignments, but the occasion was more than ordinarily significant because of the gen eral attendance. All the Senators elected as Democrats, with the exception of Mr. McLaurin, of South Carolina, were present, as were all the Senators who were elected as Silver Republi cans or Populists. All the independents except Senator Teller, of Colorado, entered the Demo cratic caucus held Just before adjournment last March, but Senator Teller then remained away. He was present, however, at to-day's conference and took part in the proceedings. The caucus was called at the instance of Senator Jones, of Arkansas, who said that he had thought it possible That the new Senators might want to make some change in the officers of the caucus. There was, however, a general expression of satisfaction with the present officials, and Sena tor Jones was unanimously re-elected chairman of the caucus. The old committee on order of business was also reappointed, and the one vacancy on that committee was filled by the selection of Senator Dubols, of Idaho, who was the choice of all the Western members of the caucus. Senator Tillman suggested that there should b"e frequent conferences and a continued effort to agree on the main features of all political controversies. Then was a general response to this suggestion, and the opinion was fairly unan \mous that the party should present a united front, permitting no more straggling than was absolutely necessary*. Senator Jones presented a statement from the Republican committee on committees, outlining its wishes as to the committee assignments, from which It appeared that the Republicans were anxious to increase the Republican membership of several committees and to decrease the Dem ocratic membership of a few. The most im portant change suggested by them was that the Republicans should be allowed to add one mem ber to their side of the Committee on Com merce, while the Democrats should agree to surrender one of the places en that committee held by them. The committee as now consti tuted includes ten Republicans and seven Dem ocrats. It was decided to resist this innova tion vigorously. The Republicans also expressed a desire to increase the membership of the committees on Aericulture and Census from nine to eleven each, the two r*\v members to be Republicans; to increase the Committee on Claims f.-om thirteen to fourteen, the Republi cans to have eight members and the Democrats clx as against seven and six respectively, as the committee Is now constituted. An increase is also proposed in the Committee on Foreign Relations. At present it has eleven members, four being Democrats. Th? proposal is to make it consist of thirteen members, eight Republi cans and five Democrats. A change was also suggested in the Committee on Irrigation, which is at present composed of six Republicans ana five Democrats. The change, if adopted, would give a membership of eleven, only four of them Democrats The Democrats decided to oppose the proposed change in the committees on Claims and Irrigation. The Republican committee, suggested no changes in the committees on Appropriations Finance and Judiciary, but indicated that it will continue Senator Jones, of Nevada, on the Finance Committee, thus practically adding one to the Republican representation and taking one from the opposition. The Republicans did not intend to take care of Senator Wellington m the matter of committees, nor was any sug gestion made in the caucus that the Democrats 6houM find places for him. FTTrnrE HAS

ROCKHILL REVIEWS . THIS GOV ERNMENTS PART IN THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. Washington. Dec. 11.— long expected report of Special Commissioner Rockhlll to the Secretary of State on the results of his work in connection with the Chinese negotiations in Peking has been submitted to Congress, together with the full text of the protocol, which hap been already published, and a mass of detailed statements. It was on this report that the President based his commendatory reference to Mr. Rockhill's work in his recent Mes sage to Congress. Beginning by detailing the conditions under which he came to be appointed in July. 1900. United States Commissioner to China, Mr. Rockhill tells of visits he mado to the Viceroys of Shanghai and Wu- Chang. which, he said, did not a little to further the interests of peace. Mr. Rockhill says that he fully concurred In all the measures that Minister Conger had been and was advocating. These negotiations extended over a period of fourteen months, and Mr. Rockhill thus summarizes the results: The circular note which you telegraphed on July 3. 1500, to our embassies In Europe and to our mis sions in Vienna. Brussels. Madrid. Tokio. The Hague and Lisbon defined the policy already then adopted by the United States in the settlement of affairs in China and from which they never de parted. Bearing these instructions always in mind, the task of the agents of our government in Peking was a comparatively easy one. Throughout the negotiations our object was to use the influence of our government in the interest of justice and mod eration and in a spirit of equal friendship to the powers negotiating jointly with us and the Chinese nation. The twelve demands made by the powers on China, the accomplishment of which was deemed necessary for the restoration of normal relations with that country, and which were embodied in the joint note of December 22. 1900. may be classified under four principal heads: First— Adequate punishment for the authors of and those guilty of actual participation in the anti foreign massacres and riots. Second— The adoption of measures necessary to prevent their recurrence. Third— The indemnification for losses sustained by States and foreigners through these riots. Fourth— The improvement of our relations, both official- and commercial, with the Chinese Gov ernment and with China generally. As regards the punishment of the responsible authors and actual perpetrators of the anti-foreign outrages, the government of the United States, while insisting that all such should be held to the utmost accountability, declined to determine in every case the nature of the punishment to be m flicted, and maintained that the Chinese Gov ernment itself should in all cases carry them out. As soon as the chief culprits had been punished, considering the terrible losses in life and property sustained by China, not only throush the Boxers and their adherents, but by the destruction of Tlen-Tsin, Peking and the military occupation of a large portion of the province of Chi-Ll, the United States threw the weight of its influence on the side of moderation and the prevention of further bloodshed. To this It was mainly due that the long lists of proscription which had been prepared by the representatives of the powers of Chinese In the provinces charged with participation in the massacres or riots were repeatedly revised before presentation to the Chinese Government. The demands for capital punishment were finally re duced from ten to four, and many names, er roneously or on insufficient evidence placed on the lists were removed or lighter forms of punish ment asked for numbers of those left on them. NO 

PROLONGED OCCUPATION. While seeking with the other cowers the best means. to prevent the recurrence of such troubles and to guard in the future American residents In Peking from such dangers as they had passed through, the United States did not lend Its , sup port to any- plan which contemplated eltht-r the prolonged occupation by foreign troops of any por tions or points in China or the erection of an in ternational fort in the city of Peking from whi :h to carry on friendly relations with the Chinese Government. Our policy has always been in favor of a strong. Independent and responsible Chinese Government which can and will be held account able for the maintenance of order and the protec tion of our citizens and their rights under the treaties. Throughout the negotiations we strictly adhered to this Just principle, with results which have proved beneficial to all. As regards the third point of the negotiations, the equitable indemnification of the various States for the losses and expenses incurred by them in U.una and in sending expeditionary forces to relieve the legations and foreign residents at Peking and re store order, and also the securing of Indemnities to societies, companies and Individuals for their pri vate losses through the anti-foreign riots, the gov ernment of the United States advocated that the sum total of these indemnities should not exceed a reasonable amount well within the powrr of China to pay. After careful inquiry you reached the con clusion that, with h*r present resources and liabili ties China could not pay as Indemnities to the powers more than $260,000,000, and that the exaction of any larger amount would not only entail perma nent financial eml-arrassm« i nt on the country, but -might possibly result In cither Int.-i national finan cial control or even loss of territory Th* repre sentative of the United States was instructed ac cordingly, and he was further told that In the opinion of our government, the amount should he asked of China by the powers jointly, without de tail or explanation, and afterward divided among them, according to their loses and disbursement?. You also stated that every facility of payment should be accorded China, and that the debt should be paid by bonds issued at par and bearing 3 per cent interest and running for thirty or forty years. THE 

INDEMNITY KEPT DOWN. Though It became necessary, after protracted dis cussion In the conference, to accept the proposition of the other powers to demand of China the Bum total of their losses and disbursements, reaching the enormous sum of $333,000,006, our Insistence in pressing for a. much lower Film and the weight of the arguments adduced in favor of such a policy resulted in closing the Indemnity nt th« above lump sum. when they bid fair to go on pwelling indefinitely. This and the acceptance of your sug gestion that th- Indemnities be paid In bonds is sued at par and bearing a low rate of interest (4 per cent was finally agreed upon), and running for forty years, resulted in saving a vast stun to China, hastened the evacuation of the country by the ex peditionary forces and the restoration of order and of normal relations with the Chinese Government. In connection with the question of th« indemnity I should particularly mention that, it having prove,! necessary to the powers In their search for reve nues applicable to the service of the indemnity debt that the existing nominal 5 per cent au valorem customs tariff on foreign imports should be made an effective 6 per cent ad valorem, thf united States, mindful of the furtherance of lawful com merce in China in the interests of the world, and believing that no opportunity should be lost to secure to foreign trade all th- facilities Its vast im portance entitles it to. and that any additional tax on trade should be met by commercial compensa tions on the part of China of equal value, declined to consent to the above increase of the customs tariff on Imports unless, first, all the treaty powers and China agreed to co-operate in the long de sired improvement of the water approaches to Shanghai and Tien-Tsin. and. second, that specific duties should be substituted for the present art valorem ones in the tariff on foreign Imports. Both or these conditions were ultimately agreed upon. No divergence of views existed] fortunately be tween -the representatives of the powers on the question of improving the channels of direct com munication between thorn and the Chinese Govern ment The long vexed question of the ceremonial to be observed in the public audiences granted by the Emperor of China to foreign representatives was finally settled by the plenipotentiaries on lines per fectly satisfactory to all parties to the negotia tions The Tsung-11-Yarru-n, or Bureau of Foreign Affairs, which the experience of forty years had shown Chinese and foreigners alike was unwieldy and incapable of discharging the duties devolv ing upon it, was altered in the way suggested by the conference, changed Into a responsible Min istry of Foreign Affairs, and organized on lines similar to those adopted in every other country of Such, in brief, has been the role played by the United States in the confeafnee of Peking. While we maintained complete independence we were able to act harmoniously in the concert of powers, the existence of which was so essential to a prompt and peaceful settlement of the v situation, we retained the friendship of all the negotiating powers, exerted a salutary influence in the cause of moderation, humanity and justice, secured ade quate reparation for wrongs done our citizens, guarantees for their future protection and labored successfully in the interests of the whole world in the cause of equal and impartial trade with an parts of the Chinese Empire.

Dec. 11.— At a meeting of the Ways and Means Committee to-day Chairman Payne was directed to report favorably to the House the Philippine tariff bill which the Re publican members of the committee agreed upon yesterday. The report will be made on Friday and the bill will be considered in the House next Tuesday, with a vote at 4 p. m. on Wednes day, instead of on Tuesday, as at first planned. Many conferences of Democratic members were held before the meeting of the committee tn-day. because of the question which had arisen ap to united opposition to the bill. It developed that the four Louisiana members now In the city. Representatives Robertson. Meyer. Davey and Ransdell. were favorable to the bill, and that the two Louisiana members out of the city. Messrs. Broussard and Brazeale, probably would favor it. The Louisiana members made no con cealment, of the fact that the sugar industry of their State required the measure of protection against Philippine sugar which the majority bili gave by applying the Dinerley rates. Under these circumstances the minority members reached no united decision, and although there will be a minority report opposing the measure on general grounds, the Louisiana members will hold themselves free to vote for it. Secretary Gage has written to Chairman Payne pointing out that the bill should provide for a rebate when articles exported from this country contain ingredients imported from th° Philippines on which duty already has been paid. The bill probably will he amended to con form to this suggestion. STATE OF WAR IW PHILIPPINES. SECRETARY ROOT SO DECIDES TN PASS ING ON THE CASE OF CAPTAIN JAMES C. READ. Washington. Dec. 11.— Secretary Root has re fused to interfere in the case of Captain James C. Read, formerly a volunteer subsistence offi cer, who was convicted by court-martial of com plicity In alleged commissary frauds in the Philippines and sentenced to dismissal and im prisonment for three years. Several important legal points are Involved in this case, the chief of which are whether a state of war existed in the Philippines at the time of the trial, and whether an officer of volunteers can be tried by a court composed of officers nf the regular ser vice, counsel for Read contending that war did not exist in the Philippines, and that the trial was i'legal. Secretary Root decided that a state of war existed in the Ph'Hppinep, but has not finally pass«"l on the other question, involving legality of the trial of a volunteer officer by a court composed- in part of regular officers, as that question is now pending before a Western court in the case of another volunteer officer.

[BY TELEGRAPH TO THE TKIBCNE.] Washington, Dec. 11.— A new phase has been reached in the execution of the Pnstoffiee De partment's policy In regard to publications de prived of the benefits of the law concerning newspapers and periodicals. It seems that Mr. Madden, the Third Assistant Postmaster Gen eral, who has been zealous in his interpretation of the. provisions of the act relating to second class mall matter, had recently ordered the post master at Chicago to exclud-i "The Inland Print er." The publisher «>f that monthly magazine. Henry T>. Shepard. of Chicago, came here last Monday and called on Mr. Madden at his office. They talked over - exclusion and differed widely In their interpretation of the law. The Inland Printer" belongs to that class of publi cations, so the department maintained, which uses what are known as colored inserts, that is. specimens printed In colored inks and inserted In the pages of the periodical, w ith a statement of the fact, as an attraction to buyers of ink. It appearf, that nc. such statement was made In the so-called inserts, and Mr. Shepard. who has been sometimes spoken ct as a candi date for Public Printer on the retirement of Mr. Palmer, desired the Third Assistant Postmaster General to take notice of this fact. The latter said that he could do nothing to Interfere with the policy of the department, and requested Mr. Shepard to carry the matter to th<* Postmaster General. Accordingly, on the same day. the publisher of "The inland Printer" sought out Senator Mason, and with him called on Postmaster Gen eral Smith at the department. Mr Smith, like Mr Madden, was disposed to uphold the ex clusion of the class of publications to which Mr Shepard's periodical was alleged to belong. It was not Senator Mason's purpose to yield the point easily. On the contrary, it is said he became earnest, not to say indignant in manner, telling the Postmaster General that Congress was Jealous of its legislative preroga tives and that when it enacted laws it wished them executed unless they were overruled by the courts having jurisdiction. These and other arguments had 'their effect. The Postmaster General directed, as a result of the interview with the Illinois Senator, that the Postmaster at Chicago should admit to the mails the copies of "The Inland Printer" on which second class rates had been prepaid. This decision has an important bearing on the question of what periodicals shall be excluded and what admitted as second class matter. It is a distinct reversal, so far as it goes, of the policy recently pursued, and which has aroused criticism in certain quarters. Senator Mason's contention that Congress made and the depart ment executed laws was recognized as valid by by the Postofflce Department. WORK OF UOCBE COMMITTEE*. CONSIDERING ANTI-ANARCHY. ANTI-TRUST AND CANAL LEGISLATION Washington. Dec. U.-Judge Ray. chairman 6f the House Jufliciary Committee, has called a meet ing of that committee for to-morrow, when the im portant questions of restricting anarchy and an archists and of formulating an anti-trust measure will be informally discussed. In view of the Presi dent's recommendations, both of these subjects are considered of the first importance. Many plans for dealing with anarchy are before the committee, and Mr. Ray is drafting a measure combining their best features. As to anti-trust legislation, conferences will be held with the President and Speaker Hen derson, with a view of determining along what lines it is desirable to proceed with this subject. Chairman Hepburn has called a meeting of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce for Friday, when some plans for isthmian canal legislation will he formulated. Mr. Hepburn said to-iav that he saw no reason why the Nicaragua Canal bill could not be reported to the Houm by next Tuesday. But he will not ask the House to act on'the bill until after the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty Is ratified by the Senate. The River and Harbor Commltttee will meet next week and shape a programme for considering a River and Harbor bill. WASHiyGTOy'S
