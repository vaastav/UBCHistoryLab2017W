Weekly MEMBER ASSOCIATED PRESS " PIONEER PAPER OF ARIZONA. ' PRESCOTT, ARIZONA, WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8. 1909. FORTY-SIXTH YEAR ECONOMY THE KEYNOTE OF PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Renews WASHINGTON, Dec 7. President Taft today sent his annual message to congress. The tariff, the Niear aguan question, sugar frauds and ""white slavery" are among the questions discussed. Perhaps the most important ques tion presented to this administration 5s that of economy- in expenditure and sufficiency of revenue, says the president, who discusses the methods taken to meet the deficit. The presi dent declares it unwise to attempt further revision of the tariff until the facts are at hand upon which such revision can properly be under taken. Speaking generally, he says the country is in a high state of pros perity. He notes the increase in the cost of living, but says the tariff Is not the cause. In those products of the factory and farm there has "been no increase in the tariff -and in many instances a very considerable reduction, the president declares. In beginning the president says: "The relations of the United "States with all foreign governments have continued on a basis of normal amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory." President Taft says the Zelaya government of Nicaragua has kept Central America in constant turmoil. It is unnecessary, he says, "to re hearse here the sad tale of unspeak-j able barbarity and oppression al-j leged to have been committed by the Zalnyan government. Recently two Americans were put, to death by order of President Zelaya himself." They "were reported to have been regularly -commissioned officers in the organiz-1 cd forces of a revolution, and as such, ' according to the modern enlightened j practices of civilized nations, they would be entitied to be dealt, with as prisoners of war." I lie continues: j "This government proceeded with deliberate circumspection to deter mine the exact truth in relation to these reports and upon the course in the premises most consistent with its dignity, its duty to American in terests and its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization." I Concerning the 'Far East, the presi-' dent says this government preserves unchanged its policy of supporting j the open door and adds : I ''Our traditional relations with the Japanese empire continue cordial as usual. The arrangement of 1908 for a co-operative control of the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily." TtnrmnnHx ? it. n I i of state upon modern lines in fur-j therance of our foreign trade and of! American interests abroad is recom-l mended. "Perhaps," continues the message, I "the most important question pre sented to this administration is that of economy in expenditures and suf ficiency of. revenue. "The report of' the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will exceed the receipts by $34,070,020. If to this deficit is ad ded the sum to be disbursed for the Panama canal, amounting to $38,000,' 000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on the public debt, the deficit of brdinaryl receipts and expenditures will be in,- creased to a total deficit of $73,075,-1 C29. This deficit the secretary pro-' poses to meet by the proceeds of bonds issued to pay the cost of con-j oirucuuj mc jruuuiun cauai. x ap prove this proposal. The policy of paying for the con struction of the Panama canal not out of current revenue but by bond issues was adopted in the Spooner Act of 1902 and there seems to be no good reason for departing from the principles by which a part at least of the burden of the cost of the canal shall fall upon our posterity, who are to enjoj it; and there is all the more reason for this view because the actual cost to date of the canal, which is now half done and which will be completed January 1, 1915, shows that the cost of engineering and constructing will be $297,766,000 instead of 139,705,200 a: originally estimated. In addition to engineering and con struction the other expenses, includ ing sanitation and government, and the amount paid for the properties, the franchise, and the privilege of building the canal, Increase the cost by $75,433,000 to a total of $375,201, 000. The increase in the cost of engin eering and construction is due to a substantial enlargement of the plan of construction by widening the can al 100 feet in the Culebra cut and by increasing the dimensions of the locks to the under-estimate of the His Recommendation for quantity of the work to be done under the original plan, and to an under-estimate of the cost of labor and. materials, both of which have greatly enhanced in price since the original estimate was made. In order to avoid a deficit for the ensuing fiscal year, I directed the heads of departments in preparation of their estimates to make them as low as possible consistent with im perative governmental necessity. The result has been, as I am advised by the secretary of. the treasury, that the estimates of the expenses of the government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911 that is, for the'' nevt fiscal year are less by $55,663,000 than the total of appro priations for the current fiscal year, and less by $94,000,000 than the es timates for that year. So far as the secretary of the treasury is able to form a judgment as to future income and compare it with the expenditure for the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1911, in cluding the payments on account or the Panama canal and the public debt, there will be no deficit in the year ending June 30, 1911, but a small surplus of $712,000. In the present estimates the needs for the departments and of the gov ernment have been cut to the quick, so to speak, and any assumption on the part of the congress, so often made in times past, that the esti mates have been prepared at the ex planation that they -may be reduced and will result in seriously hamper ing the proper administration. The secretary of the treasury points out what should- bo: .carefully noted in respect to this reduction in gov ernmental expenses for the next fiscal year, that the economies are of two kinds first, there is a saving in the' permanent administration of the de partments, bureaus and offices of the government; and second, there is a present reduction in expenses by a postponement of projects and im provements that have to be carried out but which are now delayed with the hope that additional revenue in the future will' permit their execu tion without producing a deficit. It has been impossible in the pre paration of estimates greatly to re duce the cost of permanent adminis tration. This cannot be done with out a thorough reorganization of bureaus, offices and departments. For the purpose of securing information which may enable the executive and the legislation branches to unite in a plan for the permanent reduction of the cost of governmental admin istration, the treasury department has instituted an investigation by one of the most skilled expert ac countants in the United States. The result of his work in two or three bureaus, which if extended to the entire government must occupy two or three years, has been to show much room for improvement and oj portunity for substantial reductions in the costs and increased efficiency of administration.. The object of tho investigation is to devise means to increase the average efficiency of each employe. There is great room for improvement toward these ends, not only by the reorganization of bureaus and in the avoidanco of duplication but also in the treat ment of the individual employe. Under the present system it con stantly happens that two employes receive the same salary when the work of one is. far more difficult and important and exacting that that of the other. Superior ability is not rewarded or encouraged.- As the classification is now entirely by salary, an employe often rises to the highest class while doing the easiest work for which alone he may be fitted. The investi gation ordered by my predecessor re sulted in the recommendation that the civil service be reclassified ac cording to the kind of work so that the work requiring most application and knowledge and ability shall re ceive most compensation. I believe such a change wonld bo fairor to the whole force and would perman ently improve the personnel of the service. More than this, every Teform di rected toward the improvement in the efficiency of government employes must depend on the ability of the executive to eliminate from tho gov ernment service- those who are in efficient from any cause and as the degree of efficiency in all the de partments is much lessened by the retention of old employes who have outlived their energy and usefulness it is indispensable to any proper system of economy, that provision be made so that their separation from the service shall be easy and inevit able. It is impossible to .make such Journal -Miner 

STATEHOOD The successful party in the last election in its national platform declared in favor of the admission as separate States of New Mexico and Arizona and I recommend that legislation appropriate to this end be adopted. I urge, however, that care be exercised in the preparation of the legislation affecting each Territory to secure deliberation in the selection of persons as members of the convention to draft a constitution for the incoming States and I earn estly advise that such legislation after adoption by the con vention shall be submitted to the people of the Territory for their approval at an election in which the sole issue shall be the merits of the proposed constitution and if the constitution is defeated by popular vote, means shall be provided in the enabling act for a new convention and the drafting of a new constitution. I 'think it vital that the issue as to the merits of the constitution should not be mixed up with the selection of state officers and that no election of state officers should be had until after the con stitution had been fully approved and finally settled upon. .i. .j. .j. provision unless there is adpoted a plan of civil pensions. Most o the great inaustriai cor porations and many of the well con ducted railways of the country are coming to the conclusion that a sys tem of pensions for old employes and tho substitution therefor of voungcr and more energetic fcrvants promotes both economy and efficiency of administration. I am aware that there is a strong feeling in both houses of congress and possibly in the country against the establishment of civil pensions and that this lias nearly grown out of the heavy burden of military pen sions which it has always been the policy of our government to assume j but 1 am strongly convinced that no other practical solution of the diffi culties presented by the superannua tion of civil servants can be found that that of a system of civil pen sions. The business and expenditures of the government have expanded en ormously since tho Spanish war but as the revenues have increased tri nearly the same proportion as tho expenditures until recently, the at tention of tho public and of those responsible for the government has not been fastened upon tho question of reducing the cost of administra tion. We cannot, in view of tho ad vancing prices of living, hope to save money by a reduction in the standard of salaries paid. Indeed, if any change is made in this regard an increase rather than a decrease will be necessary; and the only means of economy will be in reduc ing the .number pf employes and in. obtaining a greater average of effici ency from those retained in tho serv ice. Close investigation and study needed to make definite recommenda tions in this regard will consume at least two years. I note with much satisfaction the organization in the senate of a committee on public ex penditures, charged with the duty of conducting such an investigation, and I tender to that committee all tho assistance which the executive branch of tho government can possibly render. Fraud In Collection of Customs. I regret to refer, to tho fact of tho discovery of extensive frauds in tho collection of tho customs revenue at New York City, in which a number of the subordinate employes in the weighing and other departments were directly concerned and in which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar 'Refining company and others. The frauds consisted in the payment of duty on underweights of sugar. The government has recovered from the Ameri'in Sugar Itcfining com pany all that it is shown to have been defrauded of. The sum was received in full of tho amount due, which might have been recovered by civil suit against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there was an excess reservation in the contract of settle ment by which the settlement should not interfere with or prevent tho criminal prosecution of everyone who was found to be subject to the same. Criminal prosecutions are now pro ceeding against a number of the gov ernment officers. -Tho treasury de partment and tho department of justice are exerting every effort to discover all the wrongdoers, including RECOMMENDED. the officers and employes of the com panies who may have ' been privy to the fraud. It would seem to me that an investigation of the frauds by congress at present, jiending (the probing by the treasury department and the department of justice, as proposed, might by giving immunity and otherwise, prove an embarrass ment in securing conviction of the guilty parties. Maximum and Minimum Clause in Tariff Act. Two features of the new tariff act call for special reference. By virtue of the clause known as tho "max imum and minimum" clause it is the duty of the executive to consider the laws and practices of other countries with reference to the importation in to these countries of the products and merchandise of the United States, and if the executive finds such laws and practices not to be unduly dis criminatory against the United States the minimum duties provided in the bill arc to go into force. Unless the president makes such a finding the maximum provided for in the bill, that is, an increase of 23 per cent ac valorem over the minimum duties, are to be in force. Fear has been expressed that,, this power conferred and duly imposed on the executive is likely to lead to a tariff war. I beg to express the hope and belief that no such result need be antici pated. The discretion granted to the exe cutive by the terms "unduly dis criminator" is wide. In order that the maximum duty shall be charged against the imports from a country it is necessary that ho shall find on the part of that country not only dis criminations in its laws or its prac tices under them against the trade of the United States but that the dis criminations found shall be undue; that is, without good and fair reason. I conceive that this power was re posed in the president with tho hope that the maximum duties might nev er be applied in any caso but that tho power to apply them would en able the president and tho state de partment through friendly negotia tion to secure the elimination from the laws and the practice under them of any foreign country of that which is unduly discriminatory. No ono is seeking a tariff war or a con dition in which the spirit of retalia tion shall be aroused. Uses of the New Tariff Board. The new tariff law enables mo to appoint a tariff board to assist me in connection with tho department of state in tho administration of tho maximum and minimum clause of the act and 'also to assist officers or the government in the administration of the entire law. An examination of the law and an understanding or the nature of the facts which should be considered in discharging tho fun ctions imposed upon the executive show that I have tho power to direct the tariff board to make a compara tive glossary and encyclopedia of tho terms used and articles embraced in tho tariff law and to secure informa tion as to tho cost of production of such goods in this country and tho cost of their production in foreign countries. I havo therefore appoint ed a tariff board consisting of three members and have directed them to perform all the duties above de Early Statehood scribed. This' work, will perhaps take two or three years and I ask from congress a continuing annual appro priation eqnal to that already made for its prosecution. I believe that the work of this board will be of prime utility and importance when ever congress shall deem it wise again to readjust the customs duties. If the facts secured by the tariff board are of such a character as to show generally that their rates of duty imposed by the present tariff law are excessive under the Vrin- ciples of protection adopted in the platform o$ the successful party at the late election, I shall not hesitate to invite the attention of congress to this fact and to the necessity for action predicted thereon. Nothing, however, halts business and inter feres with the course of prosperity so much as the threatened revision of the tariff, and until the facts are at hand, after careful and deliberate investigation, upon which such revr sion can properly be undertaken, it seems to me unwise to attempt it. The amount of misinformation that creeps into arguments pro and con in respect to tariff rates is such as to require tho kind of investigation that I have directed the tariff board to make, an investigation undertaken by it wholly without respect to the effect which tho facts may havo in calling for a readjustment of the rates of duty. War Department. In the interest of immediate econ omy and because of the prospect of a deficit, I have required a reduction in the estimates of the war depart ment for the coming fiscal year, which brings ,thc .total Estimates down to an amount $45,000,000 less than the corresponding estimates for last year. This could only bo accom plished by cutting off new projects and suspending for the period of one year all progress in military matters. for the snmo reason 1 have directed that the army shall not be recruited up to its present authorized strength. These measures can hardly be more than temporary to last until our revenues are in better condition and until the whole question of the ex pediency of adopting a definite mili tary policy can be submitted to con gress, for I am sure that the inter ests of the military establishment are seriously in need of careful consider ation by congress. The laws regulat ing the organization of our armed forces in the event of war need to bo revised in order that the organi zation can be modified so as to pro duce a force which would be more consistently apportioned throughout its numerous branches. To explain the circumstances upon which this opinion is based would necessitate a lengthy discussion and I postpone It until the first convenient opportunity shall arise to send to congress a special message upon this subject. The secretary of war. calls atten tion to a number of needed changes in tho army, in all of which I concur but tho point upon which I place most emphasis is the need for an elimination bill providing a method by which the merits of officers shall have some effect upon their advance ment and by which the advancement of all may be accelerated by the ef fective elimination of a definite pro portion of the least efficient. There are in every army, and certainly in ours, a number of officers who do not violate their duty in any such way as to give reason for a court-martial or dismissal, but who do not show such aptitude and skill and character for high command as to justify their remaining in the active service to bo promoted. Provision should be made by which they may be retired on a certain proportion of their pay, increasing with their length of serv ice at the time of retirement. There is now a personnel law for the navy which itself needs amendment and to which I shall make further reference. Such a law is needed quite as much for the army. The coast defenses of the United States proper are generally all that could be desired and In some re spects they are rather more elaborate than under present conditions are needed to stop an enemy's fleet from entering the harbors defended. There is. however, ono place where addition al defenso is badly needed and that is at the mouth of Chesapeake bay, where it is proposed to make an arti ficial island for a fort which snail prevent an enemy's fleet from enter ing this most important strategical base of operations on the whole At lantic and gulf coasts. I hope that appropriate legislation will be adopt ed to secure this defense. The military and naval joint board havo unanimously agreed (that it would be unwise to make the large expenditures which at one time were contemplated in the establishment of. a naval base in the Philippines and have expressed their judgment, in which I fully concur, in favor of making an extensive naval base at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not in the Philippines. This does not dis pense with the necessity for the com paratively small appropriations re quired to finish the proper coast defenses in the Philippines now under construction on tho Island of Corrigi dor and elsewhere or to complete a suitable repair station and coaling supply station at Olongapo, where is the floating dock Dewey. I hope that mis recommendation of the joint board wilf end the discussion as to the comparative merits of Manila bay and Alongapo as naval stations and will lead to prompt measures for the proper equipment and defense of Pearl Harbor. The Navy. The president then discusses the navy, the need for reform, economy in expenditures, etc. Ho says : "A comprehensive plan for the reorganization of the officers of all corps of the navy will bo presented to congress and I" hope it will meet with action suited to its urgency." Appointment of an eminent astrono mer as head of the naval observatory is recommended. Expedition in Legal Proceed ore. The deplorable delays in the ad ministration of civil and criminal law have received the attention of committees of the American Bar asso ciation and of many state bar asso ciations, as well as tho thoncht of judges and. jurists. In my judgment . a change in judicial procedure, with a view to reducing its expense to private litigants in civil cases and facilitating the desnateh of business and final decision in both civil and criminal cases, constitntes the great est need in our American institutions. I do not doubt for ono moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty exhibited in lynchings is di rectly due to the uncertainties and injustice growing out of the delavs in trials, judgments and the execu tions thereof by our courts. Of course these remarks apply as well to the administration of justice in state courts as to that in federal courts, and without making insidious dis tinction it is perhaps not too much to say that, speaking generally the defects are less in the federal courts than in the state courts. But they arc very great in tho federal courts. The expedition with which business is disposed of both on the civil and the criminal side of English courts under modern rules of procedure makes the delays in our courts seem archaic and barbarous. TBe procedure in the federal courts should furnish an example for the state courts. I presume it is im possible, without an amendment to the constitution, to unite under one form of action the proceedings at common law and proceedings in equity in the federal courts but it is cer tainly not impossible by a statute to simplify and make short and direct tho procedure both at law and 5i equity in those courts. It is not im possible to cut down still more than it is cut down, the jurisdiction of the supreme court so as to confine it al most wholly to statutory and con stitutional questions. Under the pres ent statutes the equity and admiralty procedure in the federal courts is under the control of tho supreme court but in the pressure of busi ness to which that court is subjected it is impossible to hope that a radi cal and proper reform of tho federal equity procedure can bo brought about. I therefore recommend legis lation providing for tho appointment by the president of a commission with authority to examine the law and equity procedure of the federal courts of first instance, the law of appeals from those courts to the courts' of appeals and to the supreme court, and the costs imposed in such procedure upon the private litigants and upon the public treasury and make recommendation with a view to simplifying and expediting the procedure as far as possible and making it as inexpensive as may be to the litigant of little means. Injunction Without Notice. The platform of the successful party in the last election contained the following: 'The republican party will uphold at all times the authority and integ rity of the courts, state and federal, and will ever insist that their powers to enforce their process and to pro tect life, libertr and property shall be preserved inviolate. We believe, however, that the rules or procedure (Continued oa Page Four.)
