WEDNESDAY EVENING, DEC. 16, 1908, It is ia generally admitted by both the politic al friends, and enemies of Presi? dent Roosevelt that be made a bad break yesterday when he sent ii special message to Congress containing a vicious attack upon Jcseph Politz-r, editor of the New York World, who, it appears, is guilty of nothing more serious than aa publisher of a newspaper in a free country, called attention to a matter wbich concerns every taxrayer in the country. The World's reply, published else wherein tbe Gazette, is virtually unanswerable wben viewed from the stand-poi nt of America's free Institutions. Mr. Roosevelt is pawing the zenith ol hia career, a recession has set io and be la likely to go oat witb a bad smell. He bas for some time brought odium upon his high position by his ii judicious talk and actions, and most people have grown tired of bis domineering spirit; hence they will bri nth sher tbe fourth of next March wben his successor ahall have been inaugurate. Evkry male citizen of tbe Uoited States between the ages of 1* aod 4. is to become a part of the military force of the country and liable to perform mili? tary duty, under tbe terms of thebiil the pass-fe of whicb has been recommended by the president in one of his many ?pecial messages to Congress during the past ten days. Tbe bill provides an elastic organization and, as the president ?ays, under its provisioirs it would be just as easy to raise an army of two mil? lion men as one of 50,000. The army, in time of wer, is to consist of three branches ti be respectively designated the regular army, the National Guard and tbe volunteer army. Mr. Roose? velt would bave the Uoited States be? come a great military power, patterned after the European ta*.'ids and his pro? posed nie limit shows tba', if men do not volunteer tbey will be drafted to aerve time ia tbe army, as is done in Qf rmany and Russia. This is very re? pugnant to A ni r fans, however. A disi'Atch lo trie Biston Herald from Washington taja that William Nelson Cromwell received $220,000 for hia services in bringing about the sale of the Panama canal property to the United States. This, it is said, waa al? lowed by the French c outt. No Ameri? can name appears in the list of canal stockholder* but there are several ways of killing a dog besides shooting it. Mr. Cromwell may not have received a cent for the psit he mk ia the deal but, as a rule, he is nt in business for his health. If he got all the money for en? gineering the P-tjama secession and tbe sale of the canal property to the U. B, government tbat some people say be did, he could well alford to make the big con? tribution to the national republican cam? paign fund with wbich he was credited.
