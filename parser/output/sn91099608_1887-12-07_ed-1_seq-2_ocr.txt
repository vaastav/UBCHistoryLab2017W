PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To the Congress of the United States: Yon are confronted at the threshold of your legislative duties with a condition s! tbs sstivsal finauceswhich impertt '. tlvely-demand* Immediate and cafaful consideration. The amount of money an :v. anally received through the operation of present laws, from the- indue trie* and necessities of the people, largely exceeds the sum necessary to meet the expenses of the government When we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full endowment of the fruits of hie industry and enterprise, with only such deduction as may be his share towards the careful and economical maintenance of the government which protects him, it Is plain that'the exaction. of mow than this is "indefensible and a culpable betrayal of fairness and justice. bends of the government Durinii the 1taen' HP amonnilnj^' wfth principal and' Interest to the snmpf

Not* wlthctanding these operations of the S&jj. treasury d»partm|snt, repire»e»tations of distress iabusiness circles not only eou tlnued h?t increased, and absolute peril «emed-kt hand. ^irthese dilbumstances the contrlbntion to the sinking fund for current fleMl yea* was at ones. Si: pie ted by. the expenditure of $37,084, £88.55, in the purchase of government bonds not due, bearing 4 1-2 per cent Interest, premium being paid thereon of about 24 per oent, for the former and 8 per cent for -the latter. In addition to this, the Interest account accruing dur ing the current year upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the govornment was, to some extent, anticipated, and banks selected as depositories of public money were permitted to somewhat in crease their deposits. While the expedi ents thus employed to release to the peo ple this money lying in the treasury Served to Avert Immoilluto Danger. our surplus revenues have continued to accumulate, the excess for "the present year amounting on the first day of Decem ber to $55,258,871.19, and estimated to reach the sum of $118,000,000 on the 30th of June next, at which date it is expected that this sum, added to prior accumula tions, wiU swell the surplus in the treas ury to $140,000,000. There seems to be no assurance that, with such a with drawal from the people's circulating medium, the business community may not, in the near future, be subjected to the same distress which was- quite lately produced from the same cause. And while the functions of our national treas ury should be few and simple, and while its best oonditlon would be reached, I believe,- by its entire disconnection with the private business interests, yet when by a perversion of its purposes It.idly holds money uselessly subtracted from the channels of trade, there seems to be reason for the claim that legitimate means should be devised by the gov ernment to restore in au emergency, without waste or extravagance, such money to its place among the people. If auch an emergency arises, there now ex ists no clear and undoubted executive power of relief. Heretofore the re demption of 8 per cents, only, which were payable at the option of the govern ment, has afforded a means for the dis bursement of the excess of our revenues but these bonds have been retired and there are no bonds outstanding, the pay ment of. which we have the right to in sist upon. The contribution to the link ing fund, which furnishes the occasion for expenditures In the purchase of bonds, has been already made for tha current year, so there is no outlet in that direction. In the present state of legis lation the only pretense of any existing executive power to restore, at this time, any part of our surplus revenues to the people by its expenditures, consists in the supposition.that the secretary of the treasury mey enter the market and Purchase the Bonds of the government not yet due, at a rate of premium agreed upon. The only pro vision of law from which such a power could be derived is found in an appropria tion bill passed a number of years ago, and It Is subject to the supposition that it was Intended as temporary, and lim ited in its application. Instead of confer ring a continuing discretion and authority. No condition ought to exist which Would justify the grant of power to a single official upon his judgment of its neces sity^ to withhold from or release to busi ness of the people In an "un usual manner money held in the treasury, and thus af fect, at his will, the financial situation of the oonntry and if it Is deemed wise to lodge in the secretary of the treasury the authority In the present juncture to purchase bonds, It should be plainly vested, and provided as far as possible With such cheoks and limitations as will -define his official right and discretion, and at the same time relieve him from undue responsibility. In considering the question of purchasing bonds as a means of restoring to the circulation The Surplus Money Accumulating In the treasury, it should be borne in mind that premiums must of course, be paid upon such purchase, that there may be a large part of these held as In vestments which cannot be purchased at any price, and that combinations among holders who are willing to sell, may un reasonably enhance the cost of such bonds to the government It has been suggested that the present This wrong inflicted upon those who bear the burden of national faction, like «thtir wToags, njnUlplle8 a '.lwo of evil consequences. The public treasury, which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people's tribute to the legit imate objects of its expenditore, has be come a boarding plaee for money need lessly withdrawn from the trade and the people's use, thus crippling our national energies,' usurping otu- country's devel opment preventing investment In pro* ductive enterprises, threatening financial disturbance and Inviting schemes of pub lic plunder. Thii^ Condition of our treas ury is not altogether new it has more than once of late been submitted to the people's representatives in the congress, Who alone can apply the remedy, and yet the situation still continues with aggra vated incidents more than ever presaging financial convulsion and widespread dis aster. It will not dtf to neglect this sit nation. Because Its dangers are not now palpably imminent and apparent, they exist none the less certainly. On the 80th day of June, 1885, the excess of revenue over public expenditures, after complying ,7101 the annujJ re 9&ireTHeUt of the sinking fund act, was $11,859,785.84 during the year ended June 80, 1886, such exoess amounted to 140,405,545.20 and during the yew ended. June 80, 1887, it reached the sum of $55,567,810,531. The annual contributions to the sinking fund during the three years above speci fied amounted In the aggregate to $188, 058,890, and deducting from the surplus lolent purpose 6f our government, as stated weremade by calling in for'. I have deemed It my duty thus to that pun08e the outetandlng 8 per cent Bonded Debt Might Be Funded at a less rate of interest, and the differ ence between the old and new securities patd in cash, thus finding use for the Surplus in the treasury. The success of this plan, it Is apparent, must be founded upon the volition of the holders Of 'the present bonds and its entire certainty that the Inducement which must be offered them would result in more finan cial benefit to the government than the purchase of bonds, while the latter prop Mi tiOn would reduce the principal of the debt by actual payment, instead of ex tending it. The proposition to deposit the money held by the government in banks throughout the country for UBS by the people, is, it seems to me, an exceedingly objectionably principle, as reaching too close a relationship between the opera tion of the government to the business Of the country, and too extensive a com mingling of their money, thus fostering an unnatural reliance in private business upon public funds.* If this scheme should be adopted it should only be done as a temporary expedient, to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and exec utive effort should generally be in the opposite dieection, and should have a tendency-to divorce as muoh and as far as can safely be done, the treasury de partment from private enterprises. Of course it Is not expected that 

CUMIHSIJ and Extravagant Operations will be made for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation of an excess of revenue. Such expenditures being in demoralisation of all just con ceptions of public duty which it en tails, emulates A reckless Improvidence not in the least consistent with the mis sion of our people or the high and benef- brla* t0 six month* nrt«r«» tnn. an 10., rr" I "Preeentatives, to tha responsibility of sixmonthsprl^fjto June 80, 1887, the|i«guiatlve relief, the gravity of our fln Stttpius revenue had grows so large, by ancial situation. The failure of congress repeated accumulations, that" it was heretofore to provide against the dan feared the withdrawal of this great sum which It was quite evident the very of monfytieeded by the people, would so affect' the business of the oouutry, that the sum of $79,864,100 of such sur Jlua was applied to the payment of the principal and Interest of 8 per cent bonds still outstanding, and which were then payable at the option of the gov eminent. The precarious condition of financial affairs among the people still needing relief immediately after tho «0th day of Ju?M, 1887, the remainder of theBper Mct boj^s then outstanding, the knowledge of my country- we^ attention of their nature of the difficulty must, necessarily produce, caused a condition Of financial distress and apprehension since their last adjournment, which taxed to the ut most all the authority and expedients within executive control, and these ap pear now to be exhausted. If Disaster Basalts from the continued inaction of congress the responsibility must rest where it be longs, though the situation thus for con sidered is -fraught with danger which should be fully realised, and though Its present feature of wrong to the people as IjftU as to (the country, is but a result growing out of a perfectly palpable and apparent caus#, constantly reproducing iested national treasury and A depleted monetary condition in the business of the country. It need hardly be. stated that while the present situation demands a remedy we can-only, be saved from pre dicament by the removal of the .causa. Our 6c'aeun of Taxation.! levied upon importntlo -^•v- and Internal revenue taxes 'levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spintu OUB and malt liquors. It must be con sidered that none of these taxes relating to things subjected to Internal revenue taxation are, strictly speaking, necessary, and it so appears to be no just cause of complaint of the consumers of the arti cles, and there .seems to be nothing.so well able to bear the bnrden without hardship to any portion of the people. But our present tariff la-ws, the various, inequitable and illegal source of unneces sary taxation, ought to be at once re vised and amended. These laws, aa their primary and plain effect, raise the price to consumers of all articles imported and subjected to duty by precisely tho sum paid for such duties. Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by those who purchase for Use here import ed articles. Many of these things, how ever, are raised or manufactured in our own country. And the duties now lev ied upon foreign goods and. products are called protection to these home manu factures because they render it possible for those of our people who are manu facturers to make these taxed articles and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for the imported goods that have customs duty. So it happens that while comparatively a few use the Imported articles, millions of our people who never use and never saw any of the foreign products, purchase and use things of the-same kind made in this country, and pay therefor nearly or quite the same enhanced price which the duty adds to the Imported articles. Those Who Pay Imports pay the duty charged thereon into the public treasury. But the majority of our citizens who buy domestic articles of the same class pay a sum at least ap proximately equal to this duty to the home manufacturers. This reference to the operation of our laws is not made by way of instruction, but in order that we may be constantly reminded of the manner In which they impose a burden upon those who consume domestic products as well as those who consume Imported articles, and thus create a tax upOn all our people. It is now proposed to entirely relieve the country of this taxation. It must be ex tensively continued as the source of the government's Income an in a readjust ment of our tariff the interest of American Labor engaged in manufactures should be care fully considered, as well as the preserva tion of our manufactures. It may be called protection, or by any otherlname, but the relief from the hardships and dangers of our present tariff laws should be devised with especial pre caution against imperiling the existence of our manufacturing interest But this existence should not mean a condi tion which, without regard to the public welfare, or a natural exigency, must al ways insure the realization of the im mense profits instead of moderately profitable returns. As the volume and diversity of our national activities in crease, new recruits are added to those who desire a continuation of the advant ages which they conceive the present system of tariff taxation directly affords them.. So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the present condition been resisted by those of our fellow-cltizenB thus engaged, that there can hardly be complaint of the suspicion entertained to ascertain the extent that there exists an organized combination all along the: line to main tain their advantage. We are in the luidst of- centennial celebrations, and with becoming pride we rejoice in Amer ican skill and ingenuity, in American energy and enterprise, and the wonderful natural advantages and resources de veloped by the Century's National Growth, yet when an attempt is made to justify a scheme which permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers, quite be yond a reasonable demand for govern mental regard, it suits the purposes of manufacturers' infant industries, still needing the highest and greatest degree of care that cau be wrung from federal lecdslation. It is claimed that the in crease in the price of domestic manufac tures resulting from- the present tariff, 1b necessary in order that higher wages may be paid to our worklngmen em ployed in manufactures than are paid for so- called pauper labor. We acknowl­ edge the force of an argument which-in volves the welfare and liberal compen sation of our laboring people. Our JLabor is Honorable In the eyes of every American citizen, and has at the foundation open develop ment. and is entitled without affectation or hypocrasy, to the utmost regard. The standard of our laborers' life should not be marred by that of another country less favored, and they are entitled to their full share of our advantages. By the last census it is made appear- that over 17,383,099 of our population were engaged in all kinds of Industries 7,670, 493 are employed in agriculture 4,074, -238 in professional and personal service (2,499,876 of whom are domestic servants and laborers) while 1,810,256 are em ployed in trade and transportation and 8,837,112 are classed as employed at man-, ufacturing and mining. For present pur poses, however, the latter number should be considerably reduced^ Without at tempting to enumerate all, it will be con ceded that there should be de ducted from those which it In cludes 875,143 carpenters and joiners, 285,170 milliners and' dressmakers,, and seamstresses, 172,126 blacksmiths, 188,756 tailors and tailoresses, 17Q.000 masons, 76,241 butchers, 41,809] bakers, 22,182 plasterers, and 4,801 manufactur ing agricultural implements, leav ing 2,62a,089 persons employed in manu-' factoring Industries claimed to be bene fited In a high tariff. To Those tha Appeal Is Made to save their employment, and malntafn their wages by resisting a change. There should be no disposition to answer such suggestions by the allegations that they are in a minority among those who la bor, and therefoie. should forego an ad vantage in the interest of low prices for the majority. Their compensation, as It may be affected by the operations of tariff laws, should at all times be scru pulously kept in view, and yet with slight reflection they will not overlook the fact that they are consumers with the rest that they, too, have their own wants, and those of their families to-sup ply from their earnings, and that the prices of the necessaries of life, as well us the amount of those wants, will regu late the measures .of their welfare and comfort. But the reduction of taxation demanded should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify either the loss of employment by the workingman, nor the lessening of his wages, and the prof Its still remaining to the manufacturer, a necessary readjustment should furnish 110 excuse for the sacrifice of the in terests of his employers in either their opportunity to work, or the' Diminution ot Their Compnnaatlon. Nor can the worker la manufactories understand that while a high tariff claimed to be necessary to allow pay ment of remunerative. Wfl&es, it certainly resUlts in a very large increase {n the price of nearly all sorts of manufactures, whidb, In almost countless forms, he needs for the use of himself ai}d his fariilly.

Tlte 1 armer and the agriculturist, who manufacture nothing, but who pay the increased price which the tariff Imposes upon every ag ricultural implement, upon all he wears and upon alt he own.* except the increase Of his flocks' and herds and such things as his husbandry produces frotn the soil, is invited to aid in maintaining the pres ent situation. Mind, he is told that high duty on impo ted wool is necessary for the benefit of those who have sheep to shear In order that the price of their wool may be increased. They of course arc not reminded that the farmer who has no sheep is by this schcme obliged, In his purchase of clotliing and woolen goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow farmer, as well as to the manufacturer and merchant nor is any mention made of the fact that the sheen owners them selves, and their households, must wear clothing and use other articles manu factured from the wool they sell, at tariff prices, and thus, as consumers, must re turn their share of this Increased price to the tradesman. I think It May Ra Fairly Assumed that a large proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers throughout the country are found in small flocks number ing from twenty-five to fifty. The duty on the grade of imported wool which these sheep yield is 10 cents to each pound it of the value of 80 cents or less, and 12 cents if. of the value of more than 8U cents. If the liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece, th duty thereon would he sixty or seventv cents, and this may be taken as th utmost advancement of its price to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would thus represent the in creased price of the wool from twenty five sheep, and $86.00 that from.the wool of fifty sheep, and at present values this addition would amount to about one third of its price. If upon its sale the farmer receives this 01 a less tariff, profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum, which in all. its change will adhere to it until it reaches the consumer. When manufactured into cloth and other goods and material for use Its cost Is not only -increased to the extent of the farmer's tariff profit, but a further sum has been added for the benefit of the manufacturer under the operation of other tariff laws. In the meantime the day arrives when the farmer finds it nece'ssary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe him self and family for the winter. When he faces the tradesman for that purpose he discovers that he is obliged not only to return in the way of increased prices his tariff profit 011 the wool 8old, .and which then perhaps lies before him In manufactured form, but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase in the cost caused by a tariff duty on' the manufacture. Thus, in the end, he is aroused to the fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase as a result of the tariff scheme, which, when he sold his wool, seemed BO profitable an increase in price, more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he received upon the wool he pro duced and sold. When the number of farmers engaged in wool raising is com pared with all the farmers in the coun try, and the small proportion they bear to our population is considered when it is made apparent that, in the case of a large part of those who own sheep the lieueflt of the Preseut Tariff' on wool is illusory, and above all when It must be conceded that the increase of the-coat of living caused by such tariff, becomes a burden upon those with mod erate means, and the poor, the employed and unemployed, the sick and well, and the young and old, and that it consti tutes a tax which, with relentless grasp, is fastened upon the clothing of every man, woman and child in the land, rea sons are suggested why the removal or reduction of this duty slionld he included in a revision of our tariff laws. In speaking of the increased cost to the consumer of our homo manufactures re sulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of the same description, the fact is not overlooked that competition among our domestic producers sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of their products below the highest limit al lowed by such duty. But it is notorious that this Competition Is Too Often Strangled by combination quite prevalent at this time, and frequently called trusts, which have for their object the regulation of the supply and price of commodities made and sold by members of the combination, the people cap hardly hope for any consideration in the operation of these selfish schemers. If, however. In the absence of such combination a healthy and free competition reduces the price of any particular dutiable' article of some production below the limit which it might otherwise reach under our tariff laws, and if with such reduced price its manufacture continues to thrive, it Is en tirely evident that one thing has 1 -een (Un covered which should be carefully scrutin ized in our offert to reduce taxation. The necessity of combination to tualnl..in the price of any commodity, to the tariff point, furnishes proof- that some one is willing to accept lower prices for such commodity, and that such 1 r'ce* are re munerative, and lower prices produced by competition prove the same thing. Thus, where either of these conditions exists, a case would seem to be presented for an Easy Seduction of Taxation. The considerations which have been presented touching our tariff laws are intended only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus rev enues. ot the government be prevented by the reduction of our custom duties, and at the same time to emphasize a sugges tion that in accomplishing this purpose we may discharge a double duty to our people by granting to them a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarters Where it is most needed, and from sources where it can be most fairly and justly accorded. Nor can the presenta tion made of such consideration, be, ^vith any degree of fairness, regarded as evi dence of unfriendliness toward our man ufacturing interests, or of any lack of appreciation of their value and import ance. These interests constitute a lead ing and most substantial element of .Our Rational Greatness, and furnish the proud proof of our coun try's progress. But if, in the emergenoy that cresses upon us, onr manufactures are asked to surrendeVsomething for the public good, and to' avfert disaster, their patriotism aa well as a grateful recogni tion of advantages already afforded, should lead them to a-, willing co-opera tion. No demand is made that they shall forego all the benefits of govern mental regard 1 but they oan uot fall to be admonished of their duty, as well as their enlightened self-Interest'and safety, when they are reminded of the fact that financial panic and collapse to which the present condition tends, afford no greater shelter or protection to our manufactures than to Our Other Important Kqterprlsep, Opportunity for safe, careful i^nd. delib erate reform is now offered, and none or us should be unmindful of a time wlieu an abused and. irritated people, heedless of those wh- have resisted timely, find reasonable reli'c-f, rnuy insist upon a rad ical and weeping rectification of th«, wrongs. The difficulty attending \vlse: and fair revision of our tariff lu'vs la a'ol underestimated. It will require on the part of congress great labor 'uniti care, and espaslally abroad ^and national oon teffialatiqjj of the subjcct, .a patriotic disregard of Wjcfc local and selfish claims at* unreasonable and reckless of the miliars of the ftp Ore country, yndtr our prwefit laws, more than Four thousand articles are subject to duty. Many of these do not in any way compete with our^ manu facturers arid many are hardly worth at-, tout ion subjects of revenue. A con siderable reduction can be made in the awetrate by milling them to the free list Xhe taction of luxuribs^reSSttts no features ^I hiird'shlp, but The• NHCt'Msnries of Life useri atx-l consumed by all tbe people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of liv ing in every home, should be greatlj cheapened. The radical 'redaction. o£.tM. duties imposetl upon raw material used in mauuiiictures, or its free imffortatlbnj is of course ail luipoitant factor in any effort to reduto the price of these neces .'Uiies, it would not only relieve theai from tli'e increased cost caused by the tariff on such material, but the manu-l factured product, being thus cheapened, t.liat part of the tariff now laid upon-a.uoh froduct, us a compensation tu our tiianu lajiurers for tae present price of raw material, could be accordingly modified. Such reduction, or free importation, would serve beside to largely reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how such a change can have any in jurious effect upon our manufacturers. On the contrary, it would appear to give them a better chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of other coun tries who cheapen their wares by free material. Thus pur people might have the opportunity 8f. extending their sales beyond the limits of home consumption, saving them from the depression and In terruption in business and loss caused by a.glutted domestic market, ut\d affording their employes more certain and steady !ahor with its resulting quiet and con tentment. The question thus impera tively presented for solution should be A Spil-it Higher Than Partiality, and considered in the light of that re gard for patriotic duty which should characterize tbe actiou of those entrust ed with the weal o£ the people. But the obligation declared party policy and principle is not wanting to urge prompt aYid effective action.

Our prog ress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling upon the theories of protection and: free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets. It is a condition which con fronts us, not a theory. Smi Relief Prom Tills Condition may involve a slight reduction of the ad vantages which we award our home pro ductions, but the entire withdrawal of such advantages should not be contem plated The question of free trade is ab solutely irrelevant, and the persistent claim made In certain quarters that all efforts to relieve the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes of so-called free traders, is mischiev ous, and far removed, from any con sideration for the public good. The simp!e and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to tbe necessary sxpenses of an economical op eration of the government, and to restore to the business of tbe country the money which we hold in the treasury throuah the perversion of governmental powers* These things can, and should be done with safety to all oar industries, without danger to the opportunity for remuner ative labor which onr workingmen.rtieed', and with beneiit to them and ail State of the Union.
