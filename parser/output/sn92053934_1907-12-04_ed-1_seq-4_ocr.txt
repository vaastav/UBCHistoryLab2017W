Men and women wiser in the social world than Frank Williams bad fallen under the spell of Helen Morgan's rare sym pathy and charm and wondered how this girl of high Ideals and gentle man ners could be the daughter of Senator Morgan, ponderous with the arrogance of newly acquired wealth, and Mrs Morgan, who radiated commonplace attributes as her recently purchased diamonds scintillated light. At Frank's faltering thanks Helen Morgan began quietly, but deftly, to carry out bis instructions, placing a light gilt table here, a taboret there, and where it would be within reach of the conjurer's baud a candle or a If the Roosevelt republican dollar is to remain permanently "godless" the assumption of that fact in advance does not make it religious to keep it out or to take it out of the pockets of those who earn it. is now $33.2 Mr. Roosevelt might have added that at this time when the govern ment is issuing $50,000,000 in bonds geaming revolver.

The performance was a great suc cess. The children were duly mystified and more than delighted with the showers of trinkets and bonbons which apparently came from an inexhaustible source. Mrs. Morgan had condescend ed to express her appreciation, a foot man had served a supper of such rare delicacies that Frank had longed to pack them all up with his parapherna- foreground and Mrs. .Morgan, a' nys- terical one, in the background But in the eyes of the third he read pity, the same tender pity which lie had seen in her eyes when Helen Morgan had stooped to pick up his trick rabbit as the frightened animal, escaping from his pocket and trembling at the shouts of the children, had run to the girl for protection. "It's jail for you, young man, unless yon produce my wife's rings. She left them behind the rock crystal vase in the music room, and we don't propose to have them 'disappeared' as you do handkerchiefs and rabbits." The scene which followed was a hor rible nightmare to the young magician his own protestations of innocence drowned In Mrs. Morgan's hysterics. Senator Morgan's orders for an officer. Helen's pleading for time to search and finally the discovery of the rings by a maid In Mrs. Morgan's dressing room. And when it was all over Wil liams was thrust out in the night through a side entrance, reeling more like a thief than an acquitted man. Then suddenly a gentle hand fei: up on his arm, and a gentler voice mur mured in his ear: "Just a minute, please. I want to tell you how sorry I am. I hoped this would be the greatest night of your life" For one long minute the young man who had his own way to make and the girl whose future had been assured so far as wealth could accomplish this feat looked Into each other's eyes. Aud the soul of the man. suddenly boru. went out to the divine tenderness of Innate womanliness which is a great er power than mere physical beauty. He spoke quietly, but with new found coifidence. It has been a wonderful, wonderful night to me, and some day I am com ing back to tell you why." Under the chaperonago of a dow ager duchess who knew how to turn her title to financial account Helen Morgan was "doing" the London sea son. In a Mayfair drawing room sue sat, and "beside lier was a man with a monocle, an English accent above re proach and a patronizing air. Of course the Morgan millions would meau the remantliug of bis ancestral but crum bling castles, bul then the utter indif ference of this girl irritated him even while lt commanded his admiration "I suppose you saw Erskiue in Paris.

He never speaks duriug his erformance and has the most inscrutable eyes. Never could understand why women went in so heavily for eyes. Con jurers bore me, as a rule, but I'm curi ous to see this man." Helen Morgan hardly heard what the man with thenonoc-le was saying. "Erskiue:" In a secret drawer of her jewel case there lay a card.
