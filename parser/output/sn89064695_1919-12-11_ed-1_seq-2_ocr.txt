WILSON URGES BUDGETSYSTEM President Asks Tax and Tariff Revision in Annual Message To Congress. TREATY VIEWS LATER Railroad Situation Also to Be Dis cussed In Future MessageCurbs On Radical and Mounting Costs Are Asked. Following is the full text of Presi dent Wilson's message to the Sixty sixth congress: I sincerely regret that I cannot be present at the opening of this session of the Congress. I am thus prevented from presenting in as direct a way as could wish the many Questions that are pressing for solution at this time. Happily, i h*.ve had the advantage of the advice o* the heads of the several executive departments who have kept In close touch with affairs in their detail and whose thoughtful recom mendations 1 earnestly second. In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their aftairs grow ing out ol ieueral control, I shall take the liberty at a later day of addressing you. Budget System Urged. I hope that Congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation looking to. the establishment of a budget system. That there should be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made not independently of each other, but with reference to one single compre hensive plan of expenditure properly related to the nation's income, there can be no doubt. I believe the bur den of preparing the budget must, in nature oi the case, if the work is to be properly done and responsibility ooncentrated instead of dividend, rest upon the executive. The budget so prepared should be submitted to and approved or amended by a single com mittee of each House of Congress and no single appropriation should be made by the Congress, except such as may have been included in the budget prepared by the executive or added by the particular committee of Congress charged with the budget legislation. Another and not less important as pect of the problem is the ascertain ment of the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated are expended. Under existing law the only audit is for the purpose of as certaining whether expenditures have been lawfully made within the ap propriations. No one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely, econo mically and effectively. The auditors should be highly trained officials with permanent tenure in the Treasury de partment, free of obligations to, or mo tives of consideration for thiB or any subsequent, administration and au thorized and empowered to examine Into and make report upon the meth ods employed and the results obtained by the executive departments of the government. Their reports should be made to the Congress and to the Sec retary of the Treasury. I trust that the Congress will give immediate consideration to the prob lem of future taxation. Simplifica tion of the income and profit taxes has become an immediate necessity. These taxes performed indispensable service during the war. They must, however, be simplified, not only to save the tax payer inconvenience and expense, but in order* that his lia bility may be made certain and defi nite. Income Tax Revision Sought. With reference to the details of the revenue law, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of In ternal Revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amend ments necessary or desirable in con nection with the administration of the lawrecommendaMons which have my approval and support. It is of the ut most importance that in dealing with this matter the present law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes for the calendar year 1920, payable in the calendar year 1921. The Con gress might well consider whether the higher rates of income and profit taxes can in peace times be effectively pro ductive of revenue and whether they may not, on the contrary, be destruc tive of business activity and produc tive of waste and inefficiency. There is a point at which in peace times high rates of income and profit taxes discourage energy, remove the incentive to new enterprise, encourage extravagant expenditures and pro ,duce industrial stagnation with con sequent unemployment and other at tendant evils. America Creditor Now. Before the war America was heavily the debtor of the rest of the world and the interest payments she had to make to foreign countries on American se curities held abroad, the expenditures of American travelers abroad and the ocean freight charges she had to pay others, about balanced the valus of nsr pre-war favorable balance of trade- During the war America's ports have been greatly stimulated, and in creased prices have increased their ralue. On the other hand, she has purchased a large proportion of the American securities previously held broad, has loaned some $9,000,000,- 000 to foreign governments, and has built her own ships. Our favorable balance of trade has thus been great ly increased and Europe has been de prived of the means of meeting it here tofore existing. Europe can have only three ways of meeting the favor able balance of trade in peace times by imports into this country of gold or of goods, or by establishing new credits. Europe is in no position at the present time to ship gold to us nor could we contemplate large further imports of gold into this country with out concern. America "Greatest Capitalist." The time has nearly passed for in ternational governmental loans and it will take time to develop in this coun try a market for foreign securities. Anything therefore which would tend to prevent foreign countries from set tling for our exports by shipments of goods into this country could only have the effect of preventing them from paying for our exports and there fore of preventing the exports from being made. The productivity of the country greatly stimulated by the war must find an outlet by exports to foreign countries and any measures taken to prevent imports will inevit ably curtail exports, force curtailment of production, load the banking ma chinery of the country with credits to carry unsold products and produce industrial stagnation and unemploy ment. If we want to sell, we must be prepared to buy. Whatever therefore, may have been our views during the period of growth of American busi ness concerning tariff legislation we must now adjust our own economic life to a changed condition growing out of the fact that American business is full grown and that America is the greatest capitalist in the world. No policy of isolation will satisfy the growing needs and opportunities of America. The provincial standards and policies of the past, which have held American business as if in a straight-jacket, must yield and give way to the needs and exigencies of the new day in which we live, a day full of hope and promise for American business if we will but take advantage of the opportunities that are ours for the asking. The recent war has ended our isolation and throws upon us a great duty and responsibility. The United States must share the ex panding world market. The United States desires for itself only equal opportunity with the othe"r na tions of the world and that through the process of friendly co-operation and fair competition the legitimate in terests of the nations concerned may be successfully and equitably adjusted. Soldier Relief Advocated. "We must see to it that our return ing soldiers are assisted in every prac ticable way to find the places for which they are fitted in the daily work of the country. This can be done by developing and maintaining upon an adequate scale the admirable organiza tion created by the Department of Labor and placing men seeking work and it can also be done, in at least one very great field, by creating new opportunities for individual enterprise. Tho Secretary of the Interior has pointed out the way by which return ing soldiers may be helped to find and take up the land in the hitherto un developed regions of the country which the federal government has already prepared or can readily prepare for cultivation and also on many of the cut over and neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older states and I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently "that his plans shall receive the Immediate and substantial support, of the Congress." Dyestuff Protection Urged. In the matter of tariff legislation, I beg to call your attention to the state ments contained in my last message urging legislation with reference to the establishment of the chemical and dyestuffs industry in America. Among the industries to which spe cial consideration should be given is that of the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals. Our complete dependence upon German supplies be fore the war made the interruption of trade a cause of exceptional economic disturbance. The close relation be tween the manufacture of dyestuffs, on the one hand, and of explosives and poisonous gasses, on the other, more over, has given the industry an excep tional significance and value. Al though the United States will gladly and unhesitatingly join in the pro gram of international disarmament, it will .nevertheless be a policy of obvious prudence to make certain of the suc cessful maintenance of many strong and well-equipped chemical plants. The German chemical industry, with which we will be brought into compe tition, was and may well be again, a thoroughly knit monopoly capable of exercising a competition of a peculiar ly insidious and dangerous kind. Farmers' War Work Praised. "During the war the farmer per formed a vital and willing service to the nation. By materially increasing the production of his land he supplied America and the Allies with the in creased amounts of food necessary to keep their immense armies in the field. He indispensably helped to win the war. But there i3 now scarcely less need of increasing the produc tion in food and the necessaries of life. I ask the Congress to consider means of encouraging effort along these lines. The importance of doing everything possible to promote pro duction along economical lines, to im prove marketing, and to make rural life more'attractive and healthier, is obvious. I would urge approval of the? plans already proposed to the Congress by the Secretary of Agriculture, to se cure the essential facts required for the proper study of this question, through the pronosed enlarsomont programs for farm management stu dies and crop estimates. 'Attention Called To Unrest.. I would call your attention to the widespread condition of political rest lessness in our body politic. The causes of this unrest while various and complicated, are superficial rather than deep seated. Broadly, they arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our government to ar rive speedily at a just and permanent peace permitting return to normal conditions, from the transfusion of radical theories from seething Euro pean centers pending such delay, from heartless profiteering resulting in the increase of the cost of living, and last ly from the machinations of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal conditions this un rest will rapidly disappear. In the meantime it does much evil. It seems to me that in dealing with this situa tion Congress should not be impatient or drastic but should seek rather to remove the causes. It should endeavor to bring our country back speedily to a peace basis with ameliorated living conditions under the minimum of strictions upon personal liberty fiat is consistent with our reconstruction problems. And it should arm the fed eral government with power to deal in its criminal courts with those persons who by violent methods would abro gate our time-tested institutions. With the free expression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly po litical charge, however fundamental, there must be no interference, but to wards passion and malevolence tend ing to incite crime and insurrection under guise of political evolution there should be no leniency. Legislation to this end has been recommended by the attorney general and has been enacted. In this direct connection I would call your attention to my recommendations on August 8th, pointing out legislative measures which would be effective in controlling and bringing down the present cost of living which contrib utes so largely to this unrest. Only one of these recommendations has the Congress acted. If the government's campaign is to be effective.it is neces sary that the other steps suggested should be acted on at once. Continued Food Control Asked. I renew and strongly urge the neces sity of the extension of the present food control act as to the period of time in which it shall remain in opera tion. The Attorney General has sub mitted a bill providing for an exten sion of this act for a period of six months. As it now stands it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal proclamation of peace. It is imperative that it should be extended at once. The Department of Justice has built up extensive machinery for the purpose of enforcing its poVi sions all of which must be abandoned upon the conclusion of peace unless the provisions of this act are extended. During this period the Congress will have an opportunity to make similar, permanent. provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for interstate commerce and to exclude them from interstate^Ship ment, if the requirements of the law are not complied with. Some such regulation is imperatively necessary. The abuses that have grown up in the manipulation of prices by withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. There can be no doubt of either the necessity or the ligitlmacy of such measures. As I pointed out in my last message, publicity can accomplish a great deal in this campaign. The aiw of the government must be clearly brought to the attention of the consuming pub lic, civic organizations and state of ficials, who are in a position to lend their assistance to our efforts. You have made available funds with which to carry on this campaign, but there is no provision in the law author izing their expenditure for Ihe pur pose of making the public fully in formed about the efforts of the gov ernment. Specific recommendation has been made by the Attorney Gen eral in this regard. I would strongly urgeSipon you its immediate adoption, as it constitutes one of the preliminary steps to this campaign. Cold Storage Curbs Requested. I also renew my recommendation that the Congress pass a law regulat ing cold storage as it is regulated, for example, by the laws of the state of New Jersey, which limits the time dur ing which goods may be kept in stor age, prescribe the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period and require that goods re leased from storage shall in ail cases bear the date of their receipt, It would materially add to the service ability of the law, for the purpose we now have In view, if it were also pre scribed that all goods released from, storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each pack age the selling or market price at which they went into storage. By this means the purchaser would always be able to learn what profits stood be tween him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. We should formulate a law requir ing a federal license of all corpora tions engaged in interstate commerce and embodying in the license, or in the conditions under which it is to be issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive sailing and prevent unconscionable profits in the method of marketing. Such a law would af ford a welcome to effect other much needed reforms in the business of in terstate shipment and* in the methods of corrcrat:or..3 which are engaged in it, but ior the raomont I coadne my reon. ..rmiallci to t object imme diately .J ..i-.-i: to sower the THE
