There was a dis astrous wreck occurred about 8 o'clock this morning three-quarters of a mile west of Store's Station, on the Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railway, In which three per sona were killed and a number Injured. The dead are: JOHN PRICE, engineer special train, In stantly killed. HOMER DIXON, fireman special train, instantly killed. U ZEPRNICIt. of Delphi, clerk In the office of the engineer of maintenance of way, died from his Injuries. The Injured are: GEORGE F. RANDOLPH, general traf fic manager, shoulder dislocated. J. M.

Central Passenger -Agent Chesbrough had eleven stitches taken In the cuts about his face and is suffering from a slight concus sion of the brain. He was taken to the Grand Hotel. None of the other injured are supposed to be dangerously hurt. The train colliding were No. 22, "an ac commodation coming in from Cochran, Ind., and a special made up of a passen ger coach and two private cars. The spe cial was carrying all the general officers of the B. & O. Southwestern, except Capt. W. W. Peabody, vice presluent and gen eral manager, and President Bacon, the latter being In the East. The officials were starting out to make a thorough inspec tlon of the road. The engineer and conduc tor of the special had orders to follow fif teen minutes behind a preceding regular train and to keep out of the .way of Train 22, which had the right of way. The spe cial stopped at Storrs, where It should have waited for No. 22, but the engineer and conductor both forgot the order concerning that train and pulled out. When three quarters of a mile west of Storr's the trains came together. There was a fog which prevented seeing clearly, so neither engineer suspected a collision until the shock came. The engines were badly wrecked. The property loss Is estimated at from $10,000 to $13,000. Grade-Crossing Victims.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.-Presldent Cleve land's last annual message was transmitted to Congress to-day. Its Important features are those portions which treat of the Cuban and Turkish questions In tho foreign affairs section, and that part of the domestic sec tion relating to tariff, llnance and mo noplles. The message follows: To the Congress of the United States: As representatives of th people. In the legislative branch of their government, you have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence of our free, insti tutions, and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political content involving mo mentous consequences, fraught with fever ish apprehension, and creating aggressive ness so Intense as to approach bitterness and passion, has been waged throughout our land, and determined by the decree of free, and Independent suffrage without dis turbance of our tranquillity, or the least sign of weakness in our national structure. When we consider these Incidents, and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have succeeded' a heated clash of political opinions, we dis cover abundant evidence of a determina tion on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will, and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith In tho agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their government. Thus our people exhibit a patriotic disposi tion which entitles them to demand of thoso who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious appreciation of the trust and con fidence with which the acceptance of public duty invites. In obedtence to a constitutional require ment, 1 herein submit to the Congress cer tain information concerning national af fairs, with the suggestion of such legisla tion as, in my judgment, is necessary and expedient. To secure brevltv and nvnM tiresome narration. I shall omit many de- vvm-iiniiK iiifiiirr! wiinin ieueraj control, which, though by no means unim portant, are more profitably discussed In departmental reports. I shall also further curtail this communication by omitting a minute recital of many minor incidents connected with our foreign relations, which have heretofore found a place In executive messages, but are now contained in a re port of the secretary of state, which is herewith submitted. 'HIDEOUS AND IILOODY. Severe Condemnation of Outrages in Turkey Americana Protected. At the outset of a reference to the more Important matters affecting our relations with foreign powers It would afford me satisfaction If I could assure the Congress that the disturbed condition !n Asiatic Turkey had during the past year assumed a. less hideous and bloody aspect, ar.a that either as a consequence of the awuKening of the Turkish government to the demands of human civilization, or as the tesuii. of decisive action on the part of the great nations having the right by treaty to In terfere for the protection of those exposed to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fa naticism, the shocking features of the situ ation had been mitigated. Instead, how ever, of welcoming a softened disposition, or protective intervention, we have been afflicted by continued and not unfrequent reports of the wanton destruction of homes and the bloody butchery of men. women and children, made martyrs to their pro fession of Christian faith. While none of our citizens in Turkey has thus far been killed or wounded, though often in the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety in the future is by no mean assured. Our govemment at home and our minister at Constantinople have left nothing undone to protect our mission aries In' Ottoman territory, who constitute nearly all the Individuals residing there who have a right to claim our protection on the score of American citizenship. Our efforts in this direction will not be relaxed; but the deep feeling and sympathy that havo been aroused among our people ought not to so far blind their reason and judgment as to lead them to demand Im possible things. The outbreaks of blind fury which led to murder and pillage in Turkey occur suddenly and without notice, and an attempt on our part to force such a hostile presence there as might be effective for prevention or protection would not only be resisted by the Ottoman gov ernment, but would be regarded as an In terruption of their plans by the great na tions who assert their exclusive right to in tervene in their own time and method, for the security of life and property in Turkey. Several naval vessels are stationed In the Mediterranean as a measure of caution and to furnish all possible relief ana refuge In case ef emergency. We have made claims agaln.-t the Turk ish government for the pllla and de struction of missionary proper iy at Har poot and Marash during uprisj-.iga at those places. Thus far the validity of these de mands has not been admitted, though our minister, prior to such outrages and in an ticipation of danger, demanded protection for the persons and property of our mis sionary citizens in the localities mentioned and notwithstanding that strong evidence exists of actual complicity of Turkish sol diers In the work of destruction and rob bery. The facts as they now appear do not permit us to doubt the Justice of these claims, and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt settlement. A number of Armenian refugees having arrived at our poris, an order has lately been obtained from the Turkish govern ment permitting the wives and children of such refugees to join them here. It Is hoped that hereafter no obstacle will be Interposed to prevent the escape of all those who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them In Turkish dominions. Our recently appointed consul to Erxerum Is at hU pot and discharging the duties of hU oltice. though for some unaccountable rea son his formal exequatur from the Sultan has not hcvn Issued. I do not believe that the present somber prospect In Turkey will be long nermitted to offend the sight of Christendtvn. It so mars the human and enlightened civiliza tion that belongs to the close of the nineteenth century that It seems hardlv prWible that the earnest drmand of rood Ieoph? throughout the Christian world for its corrective treatment will remain un answered. 

WAR-RENT Ct nA. Uncle Snni'w Proposition Ignored hy Spain It eeout iii endatlouii. Tho insurrection in Cuba still continues, with all Its perplexities. It Is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made toward the pacification of tbo Island, or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my last annual message has In the least Improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all the con siderable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the In land country. If the determlnattcn of Spain to put down the Insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time, and Is evidenced by her unhesitating devotion of largely Increased military and naval forces to the task, there Is much reason to believe that the Insurgents have gained In point of numbers and character and resources, and are none the less inflexible In their re solve not to succumb without practically securing tho great objects for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority, neither have the Insurgents yet made good their title to bi regarded as an independent state. Indeed, as the contest has gone on, the pretense that civil gov ernment exists on the Island, except so far as Spain Is able to malnUJn it, has been practically abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a government, more or less Im perfectly, in the large towns and their Im mediate suburbs. But, that exception being made, the entire country is either Kiven over to anarchy or is subject to the military occupation of one or the other party. It is reported, indeed, on reliable authority that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief of the insurgent army, the putative Cuban government has now given up all attempt to exercise its functions, leaving that gov ernment confessedly (what there is the best reason for supposing It always to have been In fact) a government merely on paper. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists In the open or in pitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be looked for, and the immense superiority of the Spanish forces in numbers, dis cipline and equipment could hardly fall to tell greatly to their advantage. But they are called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements, that can choose, and dots choose, Its own ground: that from the nature of the country Is visible or invisi ble at pleasure, and that tights only from ambush, and when all the advantages of positions and numbers are on its side. In a country where all that Is indispensable to life In the way of food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtainable, especially by those born and bred on the soil. It la obvious that there Is hardly a limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be pro longed. A WAR OF DESOLATION. Meanwhile, as In all cases of protracted civil strife, the passions of the combat ants grow more and more inflamed and excesses on both fides become more fre quent and more deplorable. They also are participated In by bands of marauders who, now in the name of one party and now in the name of the other as may best suit the occasion, roam over the country at will and plunder its wretched Inhabitants for their own advantage. Such a condition of things would Inevita bly entail immense destruction of prop erty, even if it were the desire of the parties to prevent it as far as practicable. Hut while such seems to be the original policy of the Spanish government. It has now apparently abandoned It, and Is act ing upon the same theory as the insur gentsnamely, that the exigencies of the contest require the wholesale annihilation of property, that it may not prove of use, and advantage to the enemy. It is to the same end that In pursua-ice of general or ders Spanish .garrisons are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural population required to concentrate itself in the towns. The sure result would seem to be that the industrial value of the Island Is fast diminishing, and that unless there Is a speedy and radical change In existing conditions, it will soon dis appear altogether. That value consists very largely, of ccurse, in Its capacity to produce sugar a capacity already much reduced by the Interruptions to tillage which have taken place during the last two years. It Is reliably asserted that should these Interruptions continue during the current year, so much time and so much money will be required to restore the land to its normal productiveness that it Is extremely doubtful if capital can be in duced to even make tho attempt. The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the globe, would engage the serious attention of the government and people of the United States under any circumstances. In point of fact, .they -hPje a concern with it which is' by no' means of a wholly senti mental or philanthropic character. It lies so near to us as to be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in it is second only to that of the people and government of Spain. It Is reasonably estimated that at least from $30,0u0,000 to $50,000,000 of American capital is invested in plantations and in railroad, mining and other business enterprises on the island. The volume of trade between the United State3 and Cuba, which in ISSD amounted to about $64,000,000, rose In to about $103,000,000, and In the year before the present Insurrection broke out. amounted to nearly $30,000,000. AMERICAN SYMPATHIZERS. Eesldcs this large pecuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds Itself Inextricably involved In the present contest In other ways, both vexatious and costly. Many Cubans reside In this coun try, and indirectly promote the insurrec tion through the press, by public meet ings, by the purchase and shipment of arms, by the raising of funds and by other means, which the spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made the subject of criminal prose cutions. Some of them, though Cubans at heart and in all" their feelings and inter ests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the United States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible pro tection by this government, and not un naturally regarded with much indignation by tho country of their origin. The insurgents are undoubtedly encour aged and supported by the widespread sympathy the people of this country al ways and instinctively feel for every struggle for better and freer government, and which in the case of the more ad venturous and restless elements of our population, leads In only too many In stances to active and personal participa tion in the contest. The result is that this government is constantly called upon to protect American citizens, to claim dam ages and Injuries to persons and property, now estimated at many millions of dollars, and to ask explanations and apologies for the acts of Spanish officials, whose zeal for the repression of rebellion sometimes blinds them to the Immunities belonging to the unoffending citizens of a friendly power. It follows from the same causes that the United States Is compelled to actively po lice a long line of sea coast against unlaw ful expeditions, the escape of which the utmost vigilance will not always suffice to prevent. The.e Inevitable entanglements of the United States with the rebellion In Cuba, the large American property Interests af fected and considerations of philanthropy and humanity in general, have led to a vehement demand in. various quarters for some sort of positive Intervention on the part of the United States. It was at first proposed that belligerent rights should be accorded to the Insurgents, a proposition no longer urged because untimely, and, in practical operation, clearly perilous and injurious to our own interests. It has since been, and Is now sometimes, con tended that tho independence of the in surgents should be recognized. But im perfect and restricted as the Spanish gov ernment of the island may be, no other ex ists there, unless the will of the military officer In temporary command of a par ticular district can be dignified as a species of government. It is now also suggested that the United States should buy the island a suggestion possibly worthy of consideration if there were only evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a proposal. It is urged, finally, that all other methods failing, the existing Internecine strife In Cuba should be determined by our inter vention, even at the cost of a war be tween tho United Stales and Spain a war which its advocates confidently prophesy could be neither large in its proportions nor doubtful In Its Issue. The correctness of this forecast need be neither affirmed nor denied. The United States has, never theless, a character to maintain as a na tion, which plainly dictates that right and not mlerht should be the tule of its con duct. Further.- though the United States Is not a nation to which peace Is a neces sity. It Is In truth the most pacific of powers, and desires nothing so much4 as to live in amity with all the world. Its own ample and diversified domains satisfy all possible longings for territory, preclude all conquest, and prevent any casting of cove tous eyes uiton neighboring regions, how ever attractive. 

TRIBUTE TO SPANIARDS. That our conduct toward SpUn and her dominions has constituted an exception to this national disposition, is made manifest by the course of our government, not only thus far during the present Insurrection, but during the ten years that followed the rislnjj at Vara In 1S0S.

NEXT PRESIDENT PLEASED WIIX HE READ THE REFERENCE TO THE RECENT ELECTION. London Press Favorably Impressed with the XVny Mr. Cleveland Han dled the Cuban Mutter. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.-The President's message to-day was favorably received by conservative Democratic congressmen, but the jingoes were disappointed. The latter had nursed the hope that Mr. Cleveland would say something on the Cuban ques tion that would inflame the hot Castlllan blood and provoke fiery words calculated to breed trouble, whereas there Is only a covert threat between the lines in the sug gestion that there Is a limit to Yankee pa tience, which may mean a good deal or nothing, as subsequent developments may make desirable. The other portions of the message are what everybody expected. By some it Is thought the treatment of the Cuban situation foreshadows a later spe cial message. "Lon" Livingston, a jingo Georgia lire-eater, said this evening: "Mr. Cleveland made the best case I ever heard for intervention at any cost, and then, waving the American flag in his hand, he passes the complication up to his succes sor." Comments in the Senate on the message were generally favorable to the tenor of the message on the Cuban question, though there were some opposing views expressed. A large number of the senators, Including a majority of the members of the commit tee on foreign relations, excused them selves from expressing opinions, on the ground that they had not given It careful reading. Mr. Mitchell, of Oregon, said: "The mes sage seems to leave the Cuban question as he finds it, refraining from any recom mendation as to congressional action. The President's quasi Indorsement of the ex isting tariff act will scarcely be acceptable to Republicans who believe in the protect ive policy." Mr. Pettigrew: "It is the first time In our history that an executive who is the repre sentative of a defeated party ever glorified as Mr. Cleveland does in the first para graph of this message over the success at the polls of his party's opponents." Mr. Pritchard: "The only noteworthy part of the message was that devoted to Cuba, and on that question It reminded me o the old rhyme: " 'He wired In and wired out. And left the public still in doubt As to whether the hart that made the track Was coming in or going out.' " Mr. Pugh: "The message Is sound on Cuba, sound on tariff, and especially sound on trusts and monopolies." Mr. Brice: "The President has handled the questions In as diplomatic manner as possible." Mr. Nelson: "It is a fair statement so far as regards Cuba." 

VIEWS OF MR. CHANDLER. Mr. Chandler: "Its treatment of Cuba is elaborate and strong. While not going as far as I wished It would, it does by Im plication, for the last sentence very plainly says that if Spain does not suppress the rebellion very quickly the United States will be sure to Intervene to secure the ln dependence of the island. The most notable feature in the message is the omission to mention the free coinage of silver or the currency question, except to make the use less recommendation that the greenbacks be retired or not reissued when they come into the treasury. The brief allusions to tariff reiterate the Cleveland idea, that the amount of duty always increases the cost, but his feeble treatment of ttie tar iff question compared with the vehement assaults made upon the tariff In previous messages is noticeable. The tone and tem per of the whole message is excellent, and the fervid patriotism and intense personal virtue snown in it are doubtless sincere. Senator Tillman said: "It is common place. After promising not to go into de tails he gees In rather elaborately. The best thing about It Is that It is the last we will have from that source, at least the last annual message. Mr. Morgan: "In the President's recital of facts and his statement of the moral duties of the United States toward the Cuban belligerents there is a response to the sentiment or tne people, and. I believe. of the Senate. In asserting that no other nation must interfere in the affairs of Cuba there Is the most decisive and practical dec laration of the Monroe doctrine that has yet been made. But while the present gov ernment warns off all other nations the message calls the great civil war an In surrectlon. and on this false declaration It Justifies active aid to Spain In furnishing all kinds of military munitions while It re fuses our people the right to send anything, even bread or medicines, to the Insurgents. I regret that this national action is so illogical and unjust, and that It must still cost many lives and terrible suffering to a people who are admitted by the message to be at war for the sake of liberty, and not as a means of gaining fower for personal ends. Mr. Hitt. chairman of the House commit tee on foreign affairs, declined diplomatic ally to give any expression upon the mes sage. The matter might at any time be come a subject for the consideration, of his committee, and ho therefore did not think it proper to express an opinion. Mr. Heatwole. member of the foreign af fairs committer, said: "The President evi dently has been Impressed with tho senti ment which has been voiced by the people of the country in regard to Cuba during the congressional recess. He corns disposed to urge some action by the United States at the proper time, but fails to Indicate when that time snail arriv.c. Mn Turner, of Georgia, said the message was a strong, sturdv document, an appro priate farewell, adding: "From the lnfor matlon It gives to Congress it seems that the Insurrection in Cuba 13 retrograding rather than making progress. I agree with the President In the belief that the present tariff law would turnlsh sufficient revenue: If It had a fair trial, and that the surplus on hand could be well devoted to the pay ment of present expenditures until that time arrives." 

CHAIRMAN CANNON'S OPINION. Mr. Cannon, of Illinois, chairmaa of the committee on appropriations: "The deficit since the beginning of Mr. Cleveland's jres ent administration to Dec. 5, 1S06 Is $17S,- 646,000. This has been paid from proceed of the sale of bonds. This deficit was $23, 000.000 for the twelve months ending June 30, 18?G, but for a little over five months from June 30 to Dec. 5, 1S36 the deficit Is more than 110.000.000. which shows that the President's confidence that the present tariff law if allowed a fair opportunity wiU yield a sufficient revenue, is not well founded. In other words, the deficiency in revenues Is increasing and not diminishing. All of which demonstrates the absolute necessity for revenue legislation that will bring Increased receipts. It seems to me to be morally certain with such legislation properly framc-d would come a permanent return of confidence and that our financial system would In the futi It did prior to take care of ltsell "I do not believe it is pi able to tuna tho United States treasun .es. although a provision giving the .-etary of the treasury authority temporarily to noid these notes in the treasury as they are placed there In redemption or received from taxes would probably be wise. The Presi dent says we have a surplus of SlJS.OW.wiO which can be devote! to current expenses. The proceeds are borrowed money. The bare statement of that fact shows the necessity for increased revenue: and with revenue equal to expenditures, any surplus In the treasury can be used In payment of the Interest-bearing debt of the United States. "I do not know w.iat the facts are touch ing Cuba, except I gtthcr them from the message. It s-ems t':y have nothing but guerrilla warfare in the island on the part of Cubans and that there is no gov ernment In fact to recognlie. From a hasty reading of the message 1 cannot but see that it would be wisdom for Congress to await executive action and recommendation as to Cuba." Mr. Cousins, member of the foreign af fairs committee: "It is evident that the President occupies the same position that he has formerly. To be plain, he does not believe that the United States has any right to interfere, and, to be equally plain, he feels in a greater degree than he has formerly expressed, the sympathy of the American people for Cuba. He seem to think It might be possible for a condition of affairs to exist In Cuba at some time, no one knows when, that would Justify Interfering on higher grounds than' those Involved in the ordinary rights of nations. What can bo added to the situation already existing to make It sufficiently serious to justify the interference which the Presi dent has in mind?" Mr. Taft. member of the committee on foreign affairs: "The President's treat ment of the Cuban question as a whole may bo considered as a fcrmal notice to Spain that the present conditions cannot be pro longed Indefinitely. Indeed, it laya a basis fcr an intervention even before he goes out of office or it gives him an opportunity to throw tho question o:i to the shoulders of the succeeding administration. Probably he will pursue the latter course. In regard to the tariff the President Is no doubt cor rect In speaking of the deficit for the last fiscal year, but the most appalling deficit Is in the first five months of the current year nearly $40,000,000. The people want the deficit wiped out and I believe it Is the duty of the present Congress to pass the DIngley bill, or a modification of it. to In crease the revenue. It would certainly be bad policy for the Republicans as a party to oppose an effort to Increase the revenue along the lines of the Dingley bill. There Is nothing to prevent President-elect Mc Klnley from calling an extra session, even if the Dingley bill be passed, to frame u tariff on Republican lines." 

HARDLY SATISFACTORY. Mr. Dolllver, member of the ways and means committee: "The President's treat ment of the Cuban question Is hardly satis factory, either to those who desire to see Cuban independence recognized or the class who desire the United States to keep clear of foreign disputes. Mediation by the United States would bo in the direction of a bettlement honorable to all parties, but the President's hint of what is likely to happen In case mediation be refused Is a little too mysterious for practical purposes. The President's views on revenue and the tariff seem to be taken from an assortment of previous opinions onie current, at least in the White House and Treasury Depart ment." Mr. McMlllln, member of the ways and means committee, said: "I agree with the President In seeing no Immediate necessity or excuse for the Increase of tariff duties. Tho surplus on hand, outside the gold re serve, with strict economy, probably will meet all deficiencies in revenue for more than half of Mr. McKInley's administra tion, and possibly for the full four years. To Increase the tax on the necessaries of life in order either to squander or perma nently hoard this surplus U wholly Inex cusable. I have not beileved heretofore, nor do I now, that the President's recom mendations for retiring greenbacks and putting in their place either short or long term bonds, bewaring either a high or low rate of Interest. Is a remedy for our Ills. Th's would either permanently or tem porarily reduce the currency, and that is no remedy for hard times." Mr. Dalzell, member of the ways and means committee: "The message is a very fair one In Its treatment of routine matters In the departments. It gives us no addi tional light on Cuba. The President as sumes from his information which is no doubt reliable that the insurgents have no claim to possess a government or a capi tal. If this be true, they are not entitled to recognition as belligerents, and it follows that they certainly could not be recognized as possessing Independence. In his treat ment of the tariff the President is a little unfair In Judggllng with figures. He un dertakes to compare the operations of the Wilson bill one yeir with the same bill an other year. Instead of with another bill. He thinks the Wilson bill is now of a higher rharsipter than it was when he refused to sign it. He seems to fear that the country may have too mucn revenue ana Decome extravagant; a fear in which the people will not join him." Representative Walker, chairman of the rnmmittee on banking and currency: "The best mesage President Cleveland has ever written. What he says anoui tne weaKness and the viciousness of our financial meth ods is stating it mt dly. and ought to prompt the commercial organizers and bankers of thrt count rv to come to the assistance oi the banking and currency committee with a bill carefully prepared that would remedy the evils admitted to exist by every thoughtful financier." Representative Lacey: "President Cleve land is evidently anxious to pass the Cuban question over to Major McKinley. There Is no real solution of the question embraced in his message except that Spain had bet ter sell Cuba before the property is all de stroyed. AT 31'KIX 

LEY'S HOME. The rrenldent-Elect Ilead the Message with fJrent Interest. CANTON, O., Dec. 7. The reading of President Cleveland's message to Congress had scarcely been finished when President elect McKinley was presented with a copy of it. He Immediately dropped hla work In hand, and, sitting in a comfortable rocking chair, proceeded to read the Important state paper. It was a bright, sunshiny day outside. almost springlike in the balmlness of the air, and the major was evidently In his usual good spirits wnen he read aioud to friends about him the first two paragraphs uttered by Mr. Cleveland, referring to the recent election. Mr. McKinley made no effort to conceal his pleasure at the Presi dent a reference to the result of the contest. Perhaps the greatest Interest shown was In his reading of Mr. Cleveland's exposition of the Cuban situation, which he followed closely and read In full. However, neither his face nor his words gave any indication as to hla sentiments except the indication of the deepest interest in the subject under consideration. When the next President read Mr. Cleveland's words, considering the operation and effect of the present tariff law, although it was certain he did not con cur in the beliefs expressed, he made no sign bv expression of countenance or use of words that would indicate his differing Ideas on that subject, although those about him were inclined to comment. Mr. Cleve land's utterances on the statistics of the Treasury Department, retirement of green backs and national banks were all read with apparent concern, and his considera tion of trusts was read In full with the deepest interest.

LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. 7. A reporter called on W. J. Rryan this afternoon and showed him a copy of President Cleve land's message. Mr. Itryan was over whelmeel with press of work and a con stant stream of callers and. after repeated efforts, was compelled to abandon the at tempt to read the message. "Mr. Cleve land's message." Fald Mr. Ilrynn. "is too Important a document either to be com mented upon In piecemeal or briefly as a whole. I do not care to express myself upon the message until I hhall have had opiortunity to carefully read and digest it." Cin.VXS

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.-The last session of the Fifty-fourth Congress legan at noon to-day. Tho opening proceedings were very tame, the only approach to a sensation be lnff the prayer of the Senate's blind chap lain, Itev. Milburn. who stole a march on his reverend brother at the House end of the Capitol by injecting politics Into his Invocation. The House chaplain, having been ealleel down several times last session for trying to Interest thethrone of grace la current legislation, confined his prayer to orthodox channels, but Mr. Milburn cut loose with a review of the last campaign and thanks of Joy that the conservative forces of society had overwhelmed the ene mies of law and order. Incidentally ha prayed fervently for the recovery of Sena tor Allison, who Is nursing a lame ear In Dubuque, but he forgot to mention Senator Voorhees, who is In ne-ed of healing grace, an omission which led a. free gllverite col league of the Indiana Senator to call the effort a "gold-bug prayer." Senator Palmer, late hard-money Demo cratic candidate for President, was sub jected to no end of good-natured badinage. The minute he entered the Senate chamber he was surrounded by colleagues who in sisted on deluging him with extravagantly phrased compliments over his extraordi nary success as a White House rac?r. The free sllvcrites were especially profuse In their expressions of high regard for the Illinois Senator. He was good natured through It all. The usually august Sena tors and the crowds in the gallery enjoye-l the Scene Immensely. The Senate opened with crowded galleries and with that accompaniment of activity and of greeting that usually attends tho reassembling of Congress. Hut the upper branch of Congress never puts asido Us dignity, and the meeting developed no demonstrations of dramatic incidents. Tho reading of the President's message was the feature of the proceedings, and beyond this no attempt was made to enter upon the business of the session. To many of the foreign representatives occupying the diplo matic gallery the message had special In terest and significance, owing to the part they had taken In the conspicuous foreign events to which the President referred. Sir Julian Pauncefote, the Dritish embas sador, and the new Turkish minister, Moustf.pha Bey, were present. Senor De puy DeLome, the Spanish minister, was not in attendance during tho day. but two of the secretaries of the Spanish legation casually noted the reference to tho Cuban conflict. Minister Hatch, of Hawaii, and Mr. Coopar, the Hawaiian minister of for eign affairs, were listeners, although the message contained no reference to the Ha waiian islands. The diplomatic gallery waa vacated as soon aa tho foreign questions referred to in the mes sago had been read. On the floor of the Senate printed copies of the message were distributed, and thet gave the Senators opportunity to read tho salient features instead of listening to them. As a result there was scant atten tion after the reading had proceeded be yond the first half hour. The reading, of tho message covered one hour and fifty min utes, and at Its conclusion the Senate al Journed. While the scenes attending the opening of the House were both brilliant and Inter esting in the crowds that thronged tha galleries and . the conspicuous personages present, the proceedings themselves wr dull and spiritless, being distinctively rou tine. The House met, the chaplain invoked the divine blessing on the work of the ses sion, the roll was called, a committee con sisting of Mr. Cannon of Illinois, Mr. Payne of New York and Mr. Turner of Georgia was appointed to wait on the President and the latter's annual communication was read. The reading consumed about two hours. It was Mr. Cleveland's farewell message, and there was much curiosity us to his views on Cuba, especially, but there was no demonstration cither of approval or ellisent throughout its reading. The holi day nature of the day was sadde-ned by the announcement of the death of ex-Sjeak.or Crisp, which Mr. Turner, of Ge-orgU, for mally made to his associates. Out of re spect to the memory of th distinguished Georgian the House, after adopting ap propriate resolutions, immediately ad journed. 

OPENING OF THE SENATE. Scenes and Incident on the Floor In the Oallerle. WASHINGTON, Dec. The Senate chamber was a center of intercut Ions, be fore the hour for assembling had arrived and by 11 o'clock the public galleries were filled and crowds were at the entrances un able to gain admission. Sir Julian Paunce fote, accompanied by members of his etalt and several members of the Uiplomatlo corps, were in the gallery reserved for for eign representatives and with them wcr several ladles having cards from Secretary Olney. In the seat reserved for the Ylc President's family and friends nat Mr. Stevenson and several ladies.
