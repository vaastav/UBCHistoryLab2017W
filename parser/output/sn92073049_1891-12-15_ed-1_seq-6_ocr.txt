THE PROGRESSIVE FARMER: DECEMBER 15. 1891, 6 THE DURHAM F RTILIZER CASE. The case of theC-mmis-i nero Agri- culture vs. the Durham Fertilizer Com- pa y rilto.i in a non-.uit at Oxford st week As the case is now practi- 11 r . -11 - . last cally out 01 court, we mime it proper ake some comments and tfive some to m fact sioner failed to make out his case and all the costs were put on the State of North Carolina and the Durham Com- . pany are vindicated. Ttie Durham Fertilizer Company has been s 3' led "an Alliance concern." But as a nnttor of fact none of the Company are members of the organiz 1 tion. They make several brands of guan ; The "North Carolina Official Farmers' Alliance Guano"' is one of the " brands. his guano is made according . , j u i cj,t. to a formula prepared by the btate Business Agent, Bro. Worth, assisted! oy state jnemist iaiue. 10 mu,j j mentioned in this connection that the guano has given entire satisfaction for two years. This formula was sent to i nearly every reliable fertilizer factory in the country. Each and all of them declined1 to make the goods or name j prices and agree to terms. The Durham Fertilizer Company was j ihe te only one that did agree to terms I id make satisfactory prices. For so k., I and uuuifivucvuauj Uaov... j and persecuted no little. In the case just disposed of the Cora- nanv was nulled into court for shipping ! goods to Oxford untagged. !No doubt ; the Commissioner of xgriculture had a j right to seize the goods. -Nlr. (jreo. b. Terrell, guano inspector, testified be fore the court that other companies had shipped goods untagged, but they were put on before delivered Lie swore that he helped put tags on the portion of goods seized at Oxford him self, and that there was over SO tugs left over after tagging all the guano. So it is plain that the Board of Agri culture h d no more right to pro ccute the Durham Feitilizer Company than it had to prosecute others that shipped goods the same way. When Col. Robinson returned from Oxford he was interviewed by the State Chronicle, lie said that "the Durham Fertilizer Company had failed to make out its case." As the cost in the case was saddled on the State, it looks very much like Cel. Robinson "faihd to make out his case." Furthermore it is too much to expect the defendants to makeoutac.se anyhow. The prose cutor always should look after that part of a case. In this case nothing war? said about the analysis As the Company has been abused a good deal on this score and a great many crocodile tears have been shed for the "poor farmers who have been and are being swindled by the concern," we will give some facts about that. In the Agricultural But letin for May, 1891, we find that SUit Chemist Battle analyzed three samples of "N. C. Farmers' Alliance Ollicial Guano." The guaranteed value of the good3 as filed is $17.50 per ton. One sample was worth $17 GO, another $15 81, the other $17.80. As will be seen two samples went above the guarantee and one tell below. In the Bulletin for June we have four tests made by the State Chemist, as follows: $18 08, $15.or. $17 9 and $13.75. As before the sail pies varied considerably in value, and at first glace it would appear that there was too great a difference. But after comparing the test made by the State Chemist with other established brmds we are disposed to cling to the opinion that the Durham goods have held up as well, if not butter, than any other, many of the different brands falling far below the average made by the Durham goods. The records furnished by the State Chemist for f -ur years shows that some of tht m went considerably above the guarantee, while others fell far below. We suppose the reason more goods have not been seized is because the tests never average. It seems that the goods are not mixed with care and a good article may at times show a value lar below the guarantee. The following extract from the re port of State B isiness Agent Worth to the State Alliance at Morehead City in August will show these variations mid also show his contract with the Com pany : With regard to my contract made with th-i Durham fertilizer Company to nianufaci ure the N. C. Alliance Ofli cial Guano, I will say : In 18b9, I made a contract m good faith with that com pany, and it gave such general satis faction to the brethren who used the, guano that m 1890 1 renewed the con tract, believing the company was act ing in good faith with us, and making our goods fully up to their guaranteed anal sis. Tne Department of Agri-nl ture has found some guano of our offi cial brand at Aiebane which, upon be ing anal zed, was tound 12 43 p-r ton belo jv their guarantee; and another lot at Oxford $3 74 below the guarantee. As the matter has been taken to the court in Granvdle county, we hope the nc invests tion will be had, and if the Durham Fertilizer Company has 1" us irood- fully up to their rTatract we look to the North Carolina SStural Department to protect the farmers 01 ioi im v Bt.t we fail to understand why it is, that while out or 44 analyses reported in the June (1891) Bulletin, issued by. lhft Agricultural Department, we find KTO I SSX? I i59 and so on why is it that all of ; . t -m . 1 .11 tnese are passed ny and tne Alliance : brand seized? We think all should be quires 1 with ,-,..,,,1 thn fWtihpr t.nv ! tags, we understand it has teen the j custom of nearly all companies selling guano m North Carolina this season to ship their goods and order tags to be sent direct from the Department to the mil road agent at the point of destina tion.

CCIlli Ul Icl.Y. yG respectfully recommend that the Department of Agriculture require all tax on guano to be paid before it is shipped from the factories, and have tbw u, executed. HE IS TOO FULL. Last week we asked Bro. Herbert, of the Kinston Frty Press, to show up the bud spots in the Sub Treasury. Here is how it gets out of the job: Our columns are too crowded now to discuss the Sub Treasury scheme, but -we will ask Bro. Ramsey one question. and if he answers that satisfactorily (so "a to convince "-that seems to be his wy of estimating the merit of an argu- nieiitj we mai ask some more ques- tions. We wish him to tell us pro vided the Sub Treasury bill becomes the country will get along ! during the dull summer months when th , d monev Wor xh..n dllr. ig the f-ill and when they will have no produce to sell or deposit in th ware houses to get money with. v e sup pose Tiro. Ramsey will acknowledge that money is scarcer among the farm ers during the summer than during the fall months. We regret that the Free PresA has 11 t space to discuss a thing of so much importance. We notice that he ises up over three columns of space for edi torial matter in the last issue One column woidd suffice for the Sub-Treasury, and a large number of his readers are interested in the scheme and they would thank him for any light on the subject. Knock the stuffing out of it, Bro. Herbert. We will give our opinion of the cause of the scarcity of money during the summer months Naturally in a cotton country like Lenoir country, for in stance, most all of the cotton has to be sold during the fall mouths because the farmers have no Sub-Treasury ware house to store any of it. Again "the tricks of trade" are such, aided by the contracted currency of the country, that the speculators can control price Thev have it down fine. In the cotton belt business is stagnated now on ac count of the short crop and low price of cotton. But cotton goods are in de ma ml and are bringing prices qual to what, ought to be at lea-t 12 cents for otton that is bringing 7 cents. Now if Farmer Smith, of Lenoir county, could get 12 cents for his ten bales of cotton, how much difference would there be? Five thousai d pounds of lint cotton at 7 celfcs is $350, abso lutely a loss instead of any profit. Five thousand pounds at 12 cen's is $000. So Farmer Smith would have $250 in his pocket to day where he hasn't got a cent. He could pay two dollars for the Free Press, get Mrs Smith a nice new dress and still have over $200 in cash to carry him through next summer. . Where is this $250 profit. It is in the hands of the specu lator and the manufacturer. If there was a warehouse in Kinston. Farmer Smith would have u cnance to use some money during the summer months. The cotton mil!; would, more nutumily come to the S m h for the reason that the cotton is stored here instead of go ing to New York, Liverpool. Glasgow and Bremen. Our people suffer greatly owing to thefact that they sell the cot ton at ruinously low figures, and as cotton enters largely in; o the manufac ture of so many articles, our people, under existing rules, pay the freight and profits and other expenses nun dreds and thousands of miles and then in.v mo iir-iiiiio cllici U1UUH UIllU tne I goods get back to them again. What it would be to the cotton belt it would be to the grain and tob-icco belt a great boon. The above are some of the reasons for scarcity of money during the sum mer months and the remedy at the same time. Bro. Herbert should stick a pin here. The facts and figures given below are other reasons. Bro. Herbert can investigate them and see other causes for the scarcity of money, and as the Alliance demands $50 per capita to be put in circulation, he will not be dis posed to ask further questions on this point. If that i done there will be no visible reason why any farmer should not have a reasonable amount of mone all the time, if he tries. Now study the figures below, Bro. Herbert, and then acknowledge that you have been answered fully and are a converted man : In I860 we hid m ah J.0U0 we naa ,o ul rer ( amtA - average pr,ce of cotion in" N yT, 73 in X867 bad J37.51 per capita; average price of cotton in N.

In 1870 we had 18.0 per capitr; average price 01 coitou m . j.., -cmo. In 1871 we had $16 89 per capita; average price of cotton m N. Y., 20 cents. In 1S72 we had $10.14 per capita; average price of cotton in N. Y., 19 cents. In 1873 we had $15.45 per capita; average price of cotton in N. Y., 17 cents. In 1874 we had $14 51 per capita; average price of cotton in N. Y., 10 cents. In 1875 we had $14.04 per capita; average price of cotton in N. Y., 15 cents In 1870 we had $13.40 per capita; average price of cotton in N. Y. 12 cents In 1877 we had $12 28 per capita; average price of cotton in N. Y., 12 cents. In 18GS we had $11.23 per capita; average price of cotton in N. Y., 11 cents. In 1879 (date of resumption,) we had $10 05 per capita; average price of cot ton inN. Y., 11 cents. The volume of money has been gradually decreasing ever since, until to-day we have less than five dollars per capita with cotton selling at 7 cents per pound. Now mark the contrast! When this policy of contraction set in, we had 52 dollars for every man, woman and child in the United stales, with cotton selling at 72 cents; to day we have five dollars with cotton selling at seven cents. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. In this day ana time "remarkable literature," emenating from political sources, is no rarity. It comes as natural as anything else that is well established. President Harrison is out with what some of the pape s call "anablemes sage." We do not deny that it is "aole." It requires a good deal of ability to write a document that has absolutely nothing in it. The only changes the President recommends are ones that will rivet the chains of slavery on the people harder than they now are it is simply a political doeuuun that is expected to benefit the Rpunli can party. The people are not thought of, it seems. Mr. Harrison evidently thinks like all political wire pullers that the people are not in need of any thing, for he goes on to tell how pros perous they ate. If the President had to raise 7-cenr. cotton. 30-cent corn. De cent wheat for a living, he wou'd n t say it, but $50 (Hit) a year has cut oil his eye siht so he can see nothing 'but pu sperity. Mr HaTi-on's grand father will et be ashamed of his grand son.
