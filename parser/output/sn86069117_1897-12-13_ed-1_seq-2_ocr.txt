WE'RE FOR AMERICAAMERIGANS ! "The best way te get rid of a bad law ia te enferce it. Qentral Grant. President McKinley speaks iu hope ful terms, la hl message, of the pros pects regarding reciprocity treaties with Eurepean and American countries. lie expresses the belief that "by a carefal exerclse of the powers conferred by the recent Tariff act some grievances of our own and ether countries, In ear matnal trade relations, may be either removed or largely eliminated and the volume of enr commercial exchanges enlarged with advantage te both contracting parties." The Ledger some days age advised Its readers te stay away from Klendike, urging that the same energy at home would yield equal If net better results than In that frigid country. This was net "expert opinion," It is trne, but it is common sense. Se Tee Ledger feels somewhat proud te have its vlews second ed by such testimony as that of The En gineering and Mining Journal, which is unquestioned authority en such matters. It says: "When the ten millions or se of dol lars come down from there next year, don't get excited, but remember they are the sole product of a year's labor of from 0,000 te 8,000 men, who cannot afford te work gravel that yields less than one ounce of geld per man per day. If these who think of going te the Yuken country te get rich will work as hard and undergo as many privations here at home In the pursuit of money they .will, we have no doubt, be richer at the end of five years here than will be the average of these who go te Klendike. The Klendike is net nearly as rich as California was in 1830, nor as many districts In California and some ether states are today." A geed deal of distress has been felt In the minds of Democratic editors for the past few days ever the fact tbut the estimates of the Treasury Department sent te Congress at the opening of the session indicate an apparent deficit e( $21,647,885 during the fiscal year which ends June 30th, 1899. It Is proper te say, with reference te this estimate, that a recently enacted law requires the War Department te put Inte its estimate for the expenditures of the coming year all estimates made by subordinate officers of needed expendi tures upon the river and harbor works where they are employed. The result of this Is that the estimates for river and harbor Improvements nlone amounted te $65,400,409. which, of 1 course, Is from forty te fifty million dollars mere than will be appropriated for,that purpose. Notwithstanding the fact that these figures were excessive, the Treasury Department was compelled under the law te include them in Its so se called estimates, knowing full well they were absolutely excessive, and that - the appropriation for this work would fall probably 150,000,000 below the figures named. These circumstances account for the fact that the official 1 . jflgareu estimate an apparent deficit of 21,000,000, when, in fact, It la expected tMt there will be a surplus of at least ' that amount In the year In question.

SOME PASSPORT RULES. Jurcccilttta Strictness Observed bu the Police Authorities of Russia. Ytutli's Comjtanien. There are few countries in which trav elers new require passports in order te promote their convenience and security In Brazil and Venezuela a passport must be shown te the officials before one is al lowed te leave the country for a foreign pert. This Is a vexatious measure, en forced apparently for the sake of en abling a few officials te collect small fees. In Cuba passports are produced when ever travelers arrive or depart. The pre caution is considered necessary In view of the political condition of unrest pre vailing in the island. In Russia passport regulations arc en forced with great stringency. Ne trav eler is allowed te enter the empire until he has obtained a passport and convinced the Russian consular officers at the pert from which he sails that he Is neither a Reman Catholic Priest nor a Hebrew The question ordinarily asked is, "What is your religion?" but it is designed te provide against the entry of either of these two classes. When the traveler ar rives at a Russian pert, with a passport which has been properly viseed and countersigned at a consular office, it is critically examined by a police officer and duly registered. At the entrance of the hotel another police officer takes poses- sien of the document, and, in the ceurse of twenty-four hours, returns It with a permit for a limited residence in the country. When the traveler departs for another city in the empire he must have the pass port countersigned by the police. This process continues until he reaches the frontier, which he cannot cress unless the passport has been viseed and stamped by the police. Net in frequently tourists are stepped at the frontier and subjected te serious inconvenience because they have neglected te comply with the pelice regulations respecting passports. All this red tape causes anneyance at.d irritation among tourists, who are apt te overlook the fact that Russians as well as foreigners are compelled te observe these police regulations. It is the business of the police te knew where everybody ledges. A permit Is re quired If a native removes from one quarter of a town te another. Every body is registered by the police when he arrives or departs, and foreigners when they are in Russia are dealt with en equal terms with permanent residents. State or Onte, Citv or Teledo.

Congress Will Adjourn for the Holi days Saturday Afternoon. War Against Clvlt Service WW Be Made In the Heuse Iintnlgratlen Bill Will lie Considered In the Senate unit May Ue l'assed After Hrlef Oebate. Washington, Dec, 13. If the present pregramme is carried out congress will adjourn for the holiday recess next Saturday. The week in the house premises te be' made memorable by the formal inauguration of the war against the civil service law. The legislative, executive and judicial and appropriation bill, Which will be taken up en Tuesday, contains the regular appropriations for the civil service cemmissldn, and whether or net all the members who favor the repeal or modification of the law, unite te strike down the pro pre vision for its maintenance as the quickest and most direct method of crippling its operation. Undoubtedly some will advocate this ceurse and the whole civil service question will be dragged into the arena of debute. Hew long the debate will lat it is Impossible te predict, but as this is the only item in the bill which will attract much of a contest, ClmlrmHh Cannen hopes and believes the bill can be pass ed before Saturday. This latter day, under tin order made en Thursday has been set aside for paying tribute te the memory of the late represen tative Coeke, of Illinois. Mon day Chairman Hltt of the for eign affairs committee, will again seek te secure the passage of the bill te pro hibit pelagie scaling by citizens of the United States. There is some very strong opposition te the passage of this measure in its present form and the whole question of the Bchring sea negotiations may be precipitated when It is called up. Mr. Hepkins, of Illinois, and ether members favor a limitation en the period of the operation of the act, If it is te be passed, se that in case Uieat Britain refuses te restrict similarly her citizens, our citizens may net be placed at a disadvantage. Others like Mr. Jehnsen, of North Dakota, think the extinguishment of the soul heids in the near future, is curtain, and are net disposed te favor any legislation look ing te their preservation. The work of the senate se far as it has been mapped eui for the week in cludes the consideration of thj uniu irratien bill, which stands en the cal endar as the unfinished business, the probable debate of the census bill, and the pronouncing of eulogies upon the late Representative Helm an, of In diana. The general opinion among friends of the measure is that there will be no very strenuous opposition te the immigration bill, and that it may be passed after a brief debate. When a similar bill was before the sen ate last session it had its principal op ponent In Senater Gibsen, Of Mary land, and as he has retired from the senate the friends of the bill are hope ful that no one will be found who will (del called upon te champion the oppo sition. They remember however, when it was necessary in order te have the bill become a law te pass it pver the presi dent's veto, the two-thirds vote requi site for that purpose could net be se cured. Hence, while they are hopeful of the speedy and favorable considera tion of the bill, they realize the pessl' bility of delay en account of opposing speeches. There appears te be no rea son te doubt that when the vote shall be reached the bill will pass. By special arrangements between Senators Carter and Ledge, in charge respectively of the two bills, the immi gration bill will be temporarily dis placed en Tuesday in order te give Mr. Carter an opportunity te call up the bill providing for the next census. When this agreemen' & it made en last Thursday Senater Ck expressed the opinion that very In f debate would be necessary te get v..e bill through, but there are new home indications that the civil service question will be raised in this connection, and if It should, a prolonged debate may be in augurated. The friends of annexation en the committee en foreign relations are new expecting te ask the senate te take op the treaty during the week, though quite well aware of the Impos sibility of securing final action before the holidays. They are decided also upon taking the treaty up as such in stead of attempting te secure legisla tion en a joint resolution. They may postpone their 'request for considera tion until January. The senate leaders express them selves us agreeable te the house pro pre gramme for adjournment for the hol idays en Saturday. The senate eulogies en the late Representative Helman will delivered en Friday. German-Chinese Trouble Practically bet tied. Pekin, Dec. 13. The German-Chinese difficulty is practically Bottled.
