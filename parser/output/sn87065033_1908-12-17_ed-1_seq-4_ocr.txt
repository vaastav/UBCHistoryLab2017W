Roose velt has been president seven years, and it is natural for his egotism to lead him to believe that everything he has done has been satisfactory, but let us review the facts: The appropriations for the current fiscal year aggregate the enormous sum of $1,008,804,894.57. Never but once before in our history did the expenses of the government reach the thousand million dollar mark. This was in 1865, when the country was in the throes of a bitter and ex pensive war, and the expenditures amounted to $1,394,655,448. Of tunities to one in the North.

CHRISTMAS NUMBER. t IHere's our Christmas number, no aas targe or as good as we would like It; it never is. When it reaches that point where our achievement in any thing equals our ambition, then we will be with the down and outs. " But here it is, a pretty good edi tion for the times and the conditions ?'hich prevail now. Our merchants iEirii business men have responded, mobly and well, nearly all taking .space and attesting their belief in the old saying that it pays to adver itise. The advertisements will solve tthe .question of what and where and 13 ow to buy, and we commend them to the reader this morning, assuring him or her that the merchant who has enterprise to announce that he has Christmas things certainly has them. The advertisements are all home eet that is, displayed in this office- and although in every office like this there is a rush in such an undertak lng as this, we believe that they will show up as well as any of the larger city editions. The advertisements are attractively displayed, in the late and popular faces of type, and thi3 in itself shows the facilities of this ofice for getting out first-class work ia the ad line. These ads will run to Christmas, and If you are in doubt what to buy Just sketch this paper and your trouble .will be orer. We wish to extend our thanks to the business men of this city for their patronage and favors in the past year. The Dispatch has grown, steadily and gradually. Within the past several months we hare added a large num ber of new subscriptions to our list, through the medium of our voting contest, and sections, which hare never before been our patrons, are now in line. For all of which we are grateful. It's a trifle early to pass the com pliment of the season, but here's hopin', etc. , , THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Boiled down and relieved of its rhetorical embroidery, the president's message, which was delivered to con gress last Tuesday, Is a self-congratulatory document devoted to" praise of the writer and a boost of his ad ministration. The president opens his message by declaring that "the financial , standing of the nation at the present time Is excellent, and the Scandal management of the nation's interests by the government during the last seven years has shown the Churches, schools, R. F. D., and good been any unusual calls upon the treasury, still, after having expended more than a billion dollars, he would have us believe that his administra tion has been a most economical one. In speaking of the trusts, Roose velt shows that he leans toward the moneyed interests. He declares it to. be worse than folly to prohibit all corporations, as is done by the Sherman anti-trust law, and claims that trusts should be permitted to operate under control of the govern ment. This would practically leave the chief executive of the nation In control of the trusts, and any future president would be in a position to sanction obnoxious combinations, as was permitted by Roosevelt in the recent absorption of the Tennessee Coal & Iron Company by the Ameri can Steel Corporation. Roosevelt discusses labor, forests, inland waterways, the courts ami everything connected with govern ment affairs except the tariff. This was one of the principal issues of the recent presidential campaign and will be by far the most important matter with which congress will be called upon to deal. The fact that the tariff finds no place in the mes sage is somewhat singular and has occasioned surprise among both Re publicans and Democrats. Roose velt's worst enemy could not truth fully call him a dodger of issues. On the other hand, he always speaks his mind freely, and it seems more than passing strange that the tariff was not taken up and discussed in his message. J'iiiurraj;t liul Changed, j The railroad commission has made ? a change regarding demurrage rtj-i lations which will interest both shfp-j pers and consignees of freight. In j reporting a recent meeting of the j commission the Jackson correspond-) ent of the Memphis News Scimitar j gives the following information ioa-j cerning the change: I "The principal matter disposed of was the passage of an order so cluing- i ing the demurrage rule that a con signee, upon being notified that a shipment has arrived at his station, ; and where the charges seem to be I excessive, may so notify the aguu : of the railroad carrying it, within j forty-eight hours thereafter, and no demurrage may then be charged j against the shipment pending aa in-! vestigation. If, in the meantime, it develops that there was no o 1 1 -charge, storage charges must be pad by the consignee. This is the change; proposea by commissioner tcott, ana about which so much has been said", bringing to this city several promi nent officials, including Mr. Seely Dunn, of New Orleans, manager of the Louisiana Car Service Car Asso ciation." 1 r 

SOUTHERN IMMIGRATION. The progress of the South during the past few years has been most gratifying, and Northern capitalists, as well as the leading Journalists of that section, who keep in close touch with local as well as general condi tions throughout the country, assert that the era of prosperity In the South is just beginning to dawn. and her development during the next ten years will be even more rapid and more substantial than in the past decade. under the caption, 'Southern Immigration," the Pitts burg Post prints the following timely editorial: "When account is taken of the in dustrial and commercial awakening that has come to the South in 'the ast few years, coupled with the vast resources that still remain there to be touched Into life by the magic hand of progress, the thought sug gests Itself that there lies a great future. The former adjuration 'Go West' may well be superceded by 'Go South.' "The immense area comprised In the Southern States is, for the most- part, scantily populated. An idea of what the future may hold here Is Indicated by the statement that, when the density of the population of the whole South shall be equal GONE FOREVER. Ten years ago an Allen county, Kansas, farmer put his initials on a dollar bill. The next day he went to the nearest town and spent it with a merchant. Before the year was out he got the dollar back. Four times in six years the dollar came back to him for produce and tliree times he heard of it in the pockets of some of his neighbors. The last time he got " it back was four years ago.
