THE "WXLMINGTON MESSENGER, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1907. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE (Continued from Page 6) had been reached, and resolutions were adopted marking the progress made in. matters upon which agree ment T.vas not yet sufficiently com plete to make conventions practi cable. The delegates of the United States were instructed to favor an agree ment for obligatory arbitration, the establishment of a permanent court of arbitration to proceed judicially in the hearing and decision of in ternational causes, the prohibition of force for the collection of contract debts alleged to be due from gov ernment to citizens of other coun tries until after arbitration as to the justice and amount of the debt and the time and manner of payment, the immunity of private property at sea, the better definition of the rights of neutrals, and, in case any measure to that end should be in troduced, the limitation of arma ments. In the field of peaceful disposal of international differences several Important advances were made. First, as to the obligatory arbitra tion. Although the conference fail ed to secure a unanimous agreement upon the details of a convention for obligatory arbitration, it did resolve as follows': "It is unanimous: (1) In accept ing the principle for obligatory ar bitration; (2) In declaring that cer tain differences, and notably those relating to the interpretation and ap plication of international conven tional stipulations are susceptible of being submitted to obligatory arbi tration without any restriction." In view of the fact that as a re sult of the discussion the vote upon the definite treaty of obligatory ar bitration, which was proposed, stood 32 in favor to 9 against the adop tion of the treaty, there can be lit tle doubt that the great majority of the countries of the world have reached a point where they are now ready to apply practically the prin ciples thus unanimously agree upon by the conference. The second advance, and a very great one, is the agreement which relates to the use of force for the collection of contract debts. Your attention is invited to the para graphs upon this subject In my mes sage of December, 1906, and to the resolution of the Third American Conference at Rio in . the summer of 1906. The convention upon this subject adopted by the conference substantially as proposed by the American delegates is as follows: "In order to avoid between na tions armed conflicts of a purely pe-; cuniary origin arising from contract ual debts claimed of the government j of one country by the government of another country to be due to its nationals, the signatory powers agree not to have recourse to armed force for the collection of such contractual i debts. "However, this stipulation shall not be applicable when the debtor state refuses or leaves unanswered an offer to arbitrate, or, in case of acceptance, makes it impossible to formulate the terms of submission, or, after arbitration, fails to com ply with the award rendered. "It is further agreed that arbitra tion here contemplated shall be in conformity, as to procedure, with Chapter III of the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of Internation al Disputes adopted at The Hague, and that it shall determine, in so far as there shall be no agreement between the parties, the justice and the amount of the debt, the time and mode of payment thereof." Such a provision would have pre vented much injustice and extortion in the past, and I cannot doubt that its effect in the future will be most salutary. A third advance has been made in amending and perfecting the conven tion of 1899 for the voluntary set tlement of international disputes, and particularly the extension of those parts of that convention which relate to commissions of inquiry. The existence of those provisions en abled the governments of Great Brit ain and Russia to avoid war, not withstanding great public excite ment, at the time of the Dogger Bank incident, and the new conven tion agreed upon by the conference gives practical effect to the experi ence gained in that inquiry. Substantial progress was also made towards the creation of a per manent judicial tribunal for the de termination of international causes. There was very full discussion of the proposal for such a court and a general agreement was finally reach ed in favor of its creation. The con ference recommended to the signa tory powers the adoption of a draft upon which it agreed for the organi sation of the court, leaving to be determined only the method by which the judges should be selected. This remaining unsettled question is plainly one which time and good temper will solve. A further agreement of the first importance was that for the crea tion of an international prize court. The constitution, organization and procedure of such a tribunal were provided for in detail. Anyone who Tecalls the injustices under which this country suffered as a neutral power during the early part of the last century can not fail to see in this provision for an international prize court the great advance which the world is making towards the substitution of the rule of reason and justice in place of simple force. Not only will the international prize court be the means of protecting the interests of neutrals, but it is in itself a step towards the creation of the more general court for the hear ing of international controversies to which reference has just been made. The organization and action of such a prize court can not fail to accus tom the different countries to the submission of international ques tions to the decision of an interna tional tribunal, and we may confi dently expect the results of such sub mission to bring about a general agreement upon the enlargement of the practice. Numerous provisions were adopt ed for reducing the evil effects of irar and for defining the rights and duties of neutrals. The conference also proTlded for the holding of a third conference within a period similar to that which elapsed between the first and second conferences. The delegates of the United States worthily represented the spirit of the American people and maintain ed with fidelity and ability the pol icy of our government upon all the great questions discussed In the con ference. The report of the delegation, to gether with authenticated copies of the conventions signed, when re ceived, will be laid before the sen ate for its consideration. When we remember how difficult it is for one of our own legislative bodies, composed of citizens of the same country, speaking the same lan guage, living under the same laws, and having the same customs, to reach an agreement, or even to se cure a majority upon any difficult J and important subject which is pro posed for legislation, u Decomes plain that the representatives of forty-five different countries, speak ing many different languages, ac customed to different methods of procedure, with widely diverse in terests, who discussed so many dif ferent subjects and reachel agree ments upon so many, are entitled to grateful appreciation for the wisdom, patience and moderation with which they have discharged their duty. The example of this temperate dis cussion, and the agreements and ef forts to agree, among representa tives of all the nations of the earth, acting with universal recognition of the supreme obligation to promote peace, can not fail to be a power ful influence for good in future in ternational relations. 

CUBA. A year ago in consequence of a revolutionary movement in Cuba which threatened the immediate re turn to chaos of the island, the United States intervened, sending down an army and establishing a provisional government under Gov ernor Magoon. Absolute quiet and prosperity have returned to the is land because of this action. We are now taking steps to provide for elections in the island and our ex pectation is within" the coming year to be able to turn the island over again to a government chosen by the people thereof. Cuba is at our doors. It is not possible that this nation should permit Cuba again to sink into the condition from which we rescued it. All that we ask of the Cuban people is that they be prosperous, that they govern them selves so as to bring content, order and progress to their island, the Queen of the Antilles; and our only interference has been and will be to help them achieve these results. TIIK JAPANESE EXPOSITION. An invitation has been extended by Japan to the government and people of the United States to par ticipate in a great national expo sition to be held at Tokyo from April 1 to October 31, 1912, and in which the principal countries of the world are to be invited to take part. This is an occasion of special interest to all the nations of the world, and peculiarly so to us; for it is the first instance in which such a great national exposition has been held by a great power dwelling on the Pacific; and all the nations of Europe and America will, I trust, join in helping to success this first great exposition ever held by a great nation of Asia. The geographical relations of Japan and the United States as the possessors of such large portions of the coasts of the Pacific, the intimate trade relations already existing between the two countries, the warm friendship which has been maintained between them without break since the opening of Japan to intercourse with the western na tions, and her increasing wealth and production, which we regard with hearty goodwill and wish to make the occasion of mutually beneficial commerce, all unite in making it eminently desirable that this invita tion should be accepted. V heartilly recommend such legislation as will provide in generous fashion for the representation of this government and its people in the proposed ex position. Action should be taken now. We are apt to underestimate the time necessary for preparation in such cases. The invitation to the French exposition of 1900 was brought to the attention of the con gress by President Cleveland in De cember, 1895; and so many are the delays necessary to such proceedings that the period of four years and a half which then intervened before the exposition proved none too long for the proper preparation of the exhibits. 

GERMAN TARIFF AGREEMENT. The adoption of a new tariff by Germany, accompanied by conven tions for reciprocal tariff concessions between that country and most of the other countries of continental Europe, led the German government to give the notice necessary to ter minate . the reciprocal commercial agreement with this country pro claimed July 13, 1900. The notice was to take effect on the 1st of March, 1906, and in default of some other arrangements this would have left the exports from the United States to Germany subject to the general German tariff duties, from 25 to 50 per cent, higher than the conventional duties imposed upon the goods of most of our competi tors for German trade. Under a special agreement made between the two governments in February, 1906, the German govern ment postponed the operation of their notice until the 30th of June, 1907. In the meantime, deeming it to be my duty to make every pos sible effort to prevent a tariff war between the United States and Ger many arising from misunderstand ing by either country of the condi tions existing in the other, and act ing upon the invitation of the Ger man government, I sent to Berlin a commission composed of compe tent experts in the operation and administration of the customs tariff, from the departments of the Treas ury and Commerce and Labor. This commission was engaged for several months in conference with a similar commission appointed by the Ger man government, under instructions, so far as practicable, to reach, a com- mon understanding as to all the facts regarding the tariffs of the United States and Germany mate rial and relevant to the trad rela tions between the two countries. The commission reported, and upoa the basis of the report, a further tem porary commercial agreement was entered into by the two countries, pur suant to which, in the exercise of the authority conferred upon the presi dent by the third section of the tariff act of July 24, 1897, I extended the reduced tariff rates provided for in that section to champagne and aK other sparkling wines, and pursuant to which the German conventional or minimum tariff rates were ex tended to about 961 per cent, of all the exports from the United States to Germany. This agreement is to remain in force until the 30th of June, 1908, and until six months after notice by either party to ter minate it. The agreement and the report of the commission on which it is based will be laid before the congress for its information. This careful examination into the tariff relations between the United States and Germany involved an in quiry into certain of our methods of administration which had been the cause of much complaint on the part of German exporters. In this inquiry I became satisfied that cer tain vicious and unjustifiable prac tices had grown up in our customs administration, notably the practice of determining values of imports upon detective reports never dis closed to the persons whose inter ests were affected. The use of de tectives, though often necessary, tends towards abuse, and should be carefully guarded. Under our prac tice as I found it to exist in this case, the abuse had become gross and discreditable. Under it, instead of seeking information as to the market value of merchandise from the well-known and respected mem bers of the commercial community in the country of its production, se cret statements were obtained from informers and discharged employees and business rivals, and upon this kind of secret evidence the values of imported goods were frequently rais ed and heavy penalties were fre quently imposed upon importers who were never permitted to know what the evidence was and who never had an opportunity to meet it. It is quite probable that this sys tem tended towards an increase of j the duties collected upon imported goods, but I conceive it to be a vio- J Istion of law to exact more duties than the law provides, just as it is a violation to admit goods upon the payment of less than the legal rate of "duty. This practice was re pugnant to the spirit of American law and to American sense of jus tice. In the judgment of the most competent experts of the Treasury Department and the Department of Commerce and Labor it was wholly unnecessary for the due collection of the customs revenues, and the attempt to defend it merely illus trates the demoralization which nat urally follows from a long continued ! course of reliance upon such meth- J ods. I accordingly caused the reg ulations governing this branch of the customs service to be modified so that values are determined upon a hearing in which all the parties interested have an opportunity to be heard and to know the evidence against them. Moreover, our treas ury agents are accredited to the gov ernment of the country in which they seek information, and in Ger many receive the assistance of the quasi-official chambers of commerce in determining the actual market value of goods, in accordance with what I am advised to be the true construction of the law. These changes of regulations were adapted to the removal of such man ifest abuses that I have not felt that they ought to be confined to our re lations with Germany; and I have extended their operation to all other countries which have expressed a desire to enter into similar admin istrative relations. -.

I ask for authority to re-form the j agreement with China under which ; the indemnity of 1900 was ffxed, by ; remitting and cancelling the obliga- ! tioi of China for tse payment of all j that part of the stipulated r&demn- ! ity which is in excess of the sum j of eleven million, six' hundred1 and ' flfty-ffve thousand, four hundred and ( ninety-two dollars and sixty-nine ' cents, and interest at four per cent, j After the rescue of the foreign Ie- . gations in Peking during the Bczier . troubles in 1900 the powers requir ed from China the payment of equi- , table indemnities to thr several na- ! tions, and the final protocol under i which the troops were withdrawn, . signed at Peking, September 7, 1901r; fixed the amount of this indemnity i allotted to the United States at over $20,000,000, and China paid, up to and including the 1st day of June, last, a little Over $6,000,000. It "vas the first intention of this govern ment at the proper time, when all claims had been presented and all expenses ascertained as fully as pos sible, to-revise the estimates and ac count, and -as -a proof of sincere friendship - for- China voluntarily to release- that "country from its legal liability for all payments in excess of the sum ' which ' should prove, to be necessary for actual indemnity to the United States and its citizens. CHINESE STUDENTS. This nation should help in every practicable way in the education of the Chinese people, so that the vast and populous empire of China may gradually adapt itself to modern conditions. One way of doing this is by promoting the coming of Chi nese students to this country and making it attractive to them to take courses at our universities and high ed educational institutions. Our ed ucators should, so far as possible, take concerted action toward this end. MEXICO AND CENTKALi AMERICA. On the courteous invitation of the president of Mexico, the secre tary of state visited that country in. September and October and was re ceived everywhere with the greatest kindness and hospitality. He carried from the government of the United States to our south ern neighbor a message of respect and f:ocI-will and of desire for bet ter acquaintance and increasing friendship. The response from the government and the people of Mex ico was hearty and sincere. No pains were spared to manifest the most I friendly attitude and feeling toward I the United States. In view df the close neighborhood of the two countries the relations which exist between Mexico and the United States are just cause for gratification. We have a common boundary of over 1,500 miles from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific. Much of it is marked only by the shifting waters of the Rio Grande. Many thousands of Mexicans are re siding upon our side of the line and It is estimated that over 40,000 Americans are resident in Mexican territory and that American invest ments in Mexico amount to over sev en hundred million dollars. The ex traordinary industrial and commer cial prosperity of Mexico has been greatly promoted by American en terprise, and Americans are sharing largely in its results. The foreign tra,de of the republic already ex ceeds $240,000,000 per annum, and of this two-thirds both of exports and imports are exchanged with the United States. Under these circum stances numerous questions neces sarily arise between the two coun tries. These questions are always approached and disposed of in a spirit of mutual courtesy and fair dealing. Americans carrying on business in Mexico testify uniformly to the kindness and consideration with which they are treated and their sense of the security of their property and enterprises under the wise administration of the great statesman who has so long held the office of chief magistrate of that re public. . T4 The two govern men Li have been uniting their efforts for a consider able time past to aid Ceatral Amer ica in attaining the degre of peace and order which have niatie possible the prosperity of the northern parts of the continent. After the peace betwreen Guatemala, Honduras and Salvador, celebrated under the cir cumstances described in my last message, a new war broke out be tween the republics of Nicaragua, Honduras and Salvador. The efi'brt to compose this new difficulty has resulted in the acceptance of the joint suggestion of the presidents of Mexico and of the- United State for a general peace conference between all the countries of Central America. On the 17th day of September last a protocol was signed between the representatives of the five Central American countries accredited to this government agreeing upon a conference to be herd in the city ni Washington "in ordr to devise the means of preserving the good rela tions among said republics and bringing about permanent peace in those countries." The protocol in cludes the expression of a wish that the presidents of the United States and Mexico should appoint "repre sentatives to lend their good and im partial offices in a purely friendly way toward the realisation of the objects of the conference." The con ference is now in . session and will have our best wishes and, where it is practicable, our friendly assist ance.
