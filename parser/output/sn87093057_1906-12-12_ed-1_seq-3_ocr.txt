FOR YOUNG OFFENDERS Reformatory and Parol System Rec ommended to State. The first decisive action in connec tion with the movement, now more than four years old, for a Washington state reformatory under the parole system, was taken Saturday at the first meet ing of the committee appointed by Gov. Mead, when a resolution in favor of the scheme was passed and a subcom mittee named to gather statistics. H. T. Jones, one of the state board of control, in a brief speech outlined the necessity for immediate action for the improvement of the state penal in stitutions. They had arrived, he said, at the psychological moment for the in troduction of the reformatory system as it is found at the Elmira Reforma tory, New York, the Old Reformatory, New York, the Ohio Reformatory at Mansfield, the Kansas Reformatory at Hutchinson, and the first offenders' in stitutions in other states. The penitentia.y at Walla Walla is overcrowded, and it would only be a short time, said Jones, before, in the ordinary course of events, an enlarge ment will have to be made or a new building erected. This was the time when they should agitate for a reform atory where first ofenders might be sent on indeterminate sentences and given a chance to become good citizens. The experience of other states had shown that in the case of crimes of less magnitude than murder, manslaughter, highway robbery, etc., a large percent age of first offenders could be re claimed by the indeterminate sentence system. It tended to separate them from the professional class of crim inals, and the fact that good behavior and right living would shorten his term of servitude meant the redemption of many a man. The result of the discussion was a unanimous recommendation to the leg islature that such a reformatory be es tablished for men between the ages of 16 and 30 years. A subcommittee was appointed to be presided over by Corwin S. Shank and comprising Henry McLean, Mount Ver non; Judge W. W. Black of the supe rior court, Everett; Prof. Dewey, dep uty state superintendent of public in struction, Olympia; H. T. Jones, Father Hylebos, Tacoma; and John F. Miller. They are to gather statis tics regarding the economy of the pro posed reformatory and report at the next meeting of the committee on De cember 22. j Training Veterinarians at State College Since the establishment of a depart ment of Veterinary Science at the state college, there has been a steady growth in the number of students in attendance as well as a large increase in the number and variety of cases brought to the attention of the students. Early in the history of the department it was recognized as essential to have a large clinic for the instruction of students in the practical application of principles taught in books. Accord ingly, the afternoons are devoted to jtht* holding of surgical clinics, when all cases presented are given the know ledge of the faculty of veterinarians, free of charge to the owner. The method employed has been ex tremely satisfactory to the faculty and the student body, and from the con stant increase in the number of cases brought in for treatment, must be meeting with the approval of the stock men in general. After a close examin ation of the afflicted animal, the case is thoroughly analyzed by the professor and the class, after which a diagnosis ' is given and the probabilities of relief explained to the owner. If of a surgical nature, the operation is usually performed by a student under the im mediate supervision of the professor. In this way the operator and the rest of the class get the most possible bene fit from the work performed. The operating room in which the clinics are held is a large, well lighted room, equipped with an operating table, ster ilizing apparatus, and a collection of instruments of the most improved type. One feature of the operating room is the maintenance of absolutely antisep tic conditions. Bacteria that wander into this operating room rarely get out alive. The most absolute cleanliness is also insisted upon. A large commodious hospital is main tained in connection with the depart ment, containing a number of single and box stalls for horses, besides wash rooms, etc., and a set of dog kennels and cages for the smaller animals. Horses and carriages are kept in readiness at all times, to take students to cases which cannot be brought to the hospital, thus presenting to the students that phase of a busy prac titioner's life—emergency work—which he would otherwise miss. That the free clinic is appreciated mostly by those who know it best is demonstrated by the increasing at tendance, from year to year, and the fact that there is hardly a town or village in this whole section of the country which has not at some time had occasion to forward diseased animals here for treatment. The splendid opportunities thus presented to students may be illustrated by the ' fact that approximately 1000 horses < and scores of dogs are brought here i annually for practically every disease 1 known to the veterinary profession. 1 Another important phase of the work i is the training of feed for men who wish to go into the government service. Since the passage of the new meat ( inspection law, the demand for men in the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industries , has much increased. The trainingi ( offered by the veterinary department is particularly adapted to fit men for this branch of the Civil Service. 1 I i Former Senator Shot. h 

WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 10-For- : mer United States Senator Arthur ] Brown, from Utah, was found in his i room on the second floor of the Hotel j ] Raleigh this afternoon shot twice ] through the abdomen and perhaps fatally wounded. The woman who was with him at the time and who gave the name of Annie M. Bradley, was arrest ed. She refused to discuss the cause ' leading to the shooting. • —-——— I SALT LAKE, Dec. 10—Arthur Brown, a prominent lawyer of this city and who | was shot by a woman in the Raleigh hotel, Washington, left a week ago to argue an important case before the < United States supreme court. Mrs. Bradley, the woman who was found in the room with him, left here two days later. About three years ago charges were filed against Brown by his wife charg ing him and the Bradley woman with immoral conduct. Mrs. Brown with- 1 drew the charges before the case went to trial and he was acquitted. Mrs. Bradley pleaded guilty, but was per- , mitted to withdraw the plea and was : dismissed. Brown's wife died two , years ago. Third Crop of Strawberries. Second growth strawberries are com mon in the Yakima Valley and at var ious other points in the state of Washington, but the third crop is almost unprecedented anywhere, yet Prosser can claim that distinction. There is on exhibition at the Bulletin office a little bunch of ripe strawberries picked by T. M. Hoshuw, of this city, from his garden November 30. Along with the strawberries he brought another curiosity in the shape of second-growth apples, which had ripened at about one-fourth their natural size, having picked about twenty-five from one tree. With winter prevailing in the East and mid dle west, the Yakima Valley is basking in sunshine, the climate is so mild that the second crop and even third crops of fruit are developing in a soil that is equal to that of the valley of the Nile —Prosser Bulletin. 0. R. & N. to Spend Money. New bridges and betterments on O. R. & N $ 850,00(1 Line changes, O. R. & N 750,000 Improvements on main line and branches of Southern Pacific 600,000 Total $2,200,000 That is a portion of the budget of the Harriman system in the Northwest for 1907, states a Portland report. In the O. R. and N. there are a number of bridges to be renewed in addition to general betterments planned. On the main line between The Dalles and Uma tilla the road is to be changed in places, to conform to the same standards as have been established between The Dalles and Cascade Locks, and are be- 1 ing installed between Bonneville and Troutdale. The work abo-eThe Dalles will cost $750,000, according to esti mates. Citizenship for Japanese. If favorable action by congress is j taken upon the recommendations in President Roosevelt's message that , naturalization be extended to the Jap anese, it will go far toward securing the traditional friendly relations be tween the two countries is the opinion expressed by Viscount Aoki, the Jap- 1 anese ambassador at Washington. The viscount is also of the opinion ' that very few Orientals would avail ' themselves of the opportunity which ' would permit them to embrace Ameri- 1 can citizenship.

A proposition looking toward the building of a flouring mill at this place is being agitated among the farmers and business men, and is meeting with favor every where. We understand the proposition has the backing of the Farmer's Grain & Supply Co., of Spo kane, and a meeting has been called for January sth at which time it is hoped definite action will be taken. Paha Points. Kay Schuler visited Ritzville Satur day and Sunday. Mr. Sharp of Paha is down with typhoid at Ritzville. Mr. Tiede has on hand a fine lot of Christmas presents.

The citizens have met, appoint ed committees and otherwise provided for a good time -on Tuesday night the 25th of December. Prosser Pickups. Mr. Lay port is here from Aberdeen with his family looking over the locality with a view of locating. German Lutheran services were con ducted in the Jensen building last Sunday by Rev. H. Wittrock. A Mr. Rainey, of Seattle, who owns some property under the proposed government irrigation ditch, was here last week. Hon. G. W. Hamilton, representative elected of Benton county, spent a couple of days of last week over in Franklin county on legal business. H. J. Spencer is looking over some homestead claims on the Columbia river for some friends of his. Mr. Spencer is now located at Irrigon, .Ore. Attorney Bert Linn has been on legal business up in Yakima county the past week. Bert is quite a rustler and is always there with the goods. About two inches of snow fell here the past week and was a welcome visitor to the wheat farmers. Its vißit was only a transient one, however, nearly all being gone at this time. A representative of the Syphers Machinery Co., of Spokane, was in town last week inspecting the machinery they installed in the flour mill at this place. He reports everything running smoothly. Dr. Adams, who last spring pur chased a fruit ranch at Euclid, has moved back to town and will engage in the practice of his profession. He says he marketed over 3000 boxes of fine apples grown on his ranch the past year. Prosser is to have another attorney. A Mr. Wilson, formerly prosecuting attorney of Kootenai county, Idaho, has located in the city and has opened offices in the Mercer block. Glad to have you with us Mr. Wilson. Messrs. Hull & Co. have received from Honolulu, Hawaii, quite an order for hay, both alfalfa and wheat, which they will ship just as soon as cars can be had. From present indications the car shortage will not soon be relieved and it is barely possible that they will be unable to fill the order on this ac count. The trouble between Yakima and Benton counties that has been in exis tance ever since Benton became a county, has been finally settled and Benton will pay to Yakima the sum of $22,000, instead of the $33,000 she demanded. For this happy culmin ation of the tangle much credit is due Auditor Glovd of Benton countv. Hon. E. W. Ross, Commissioner of Public Lands, of Olympia, was here last week and, with a party of friends from Seattle, accompanied by E. F. Benson, of Prosser, drove over to the White Bluffs country and looked over the progress being made by the Han ford Irrigation Co. Mr. Ross' visit was an official one, the State having some 3000 acres of land that will be under the irrigation project. We are in position to meet every reasonable call within the line of bank ing. —German American State Bank. Wheeler Doings. Mrs. C. T. Sanders has moved to Wilson Creek for the winter. We are informed that Mrs. Ropp is thinking seriously of moving away from this community and locating in Califor nia. We hope this report will prove to be unfounded. A new post-office has been establish ed at Moses Lake and it is now being served by G. W. Brockmueller who has the contract for carrying the mail be tween Wheeler and Wilson Creek. E. E. Benson lost a very valuable young horse on the 29th of last month. Mr. Benson says he was not in a posi tion to be particularly thankful on that day, notwithstanding the presi dent's proclamation. The Wheeler country is in sore need of a railroad. A farmer that raises a good crop of wheat is usually all winter getting it to market. Many of our farmers are now hauling and many of them are only well started. The Washington Land Co. are mak ing extensive improvements on their farm lands in their neighborhood. They are having wells drilled and are erecting houses and barns and breaking up their lands, and it makes a wide difference in the appearance of the country. Harrington. C. E.

Siegrist and wife have gone back to Nebraska on quite an extended visit with relatives and friends at Stromberg. Tom Newland, and a party of friends left for the wilds of Stevens county on a hunting trip after bear. Judging by the number and the size of the guns the boys took with them Stevens county will not need a game warden after the boys finish their hunt. The bean guessing contest at Mar ley Fischers' resulted in Joe Newland winning the gold watch, his guess be ing .1710 while there was just 3709 beans in the pitcher. When it comes to guessing on beans a man don't stand much show were a Missourian has a guess. News has been received here of the death Of Rev. J. B.
