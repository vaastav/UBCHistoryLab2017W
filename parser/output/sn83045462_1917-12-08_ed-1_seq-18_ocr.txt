NATION FEARS FUTURE BY HERBERT COREY. BERN, Switzerland, October 26.?, Much has been said of the manner In which the German empire has been converted Into a great war machine. That this is literally true can only be comprehended in its entirety by those j who are now living in Germany. i*ven across the border, however, it is possi ble to discern this much: Not one wheel is turning in Germany today unless that wheel is directly or indirectly engaged in the furtherance of the war. It is not every .German who is so favorably situated that when he needs something for office or house he can drop into a factory and buy it over the counter. Very well, then. tP?re were any considerable manufacturing in Germany, outside of war manufac ture, the fact would show in the freights. No Freights Except War Freights. j There are no Treights except war I freights in Germany. _ I The managements of the various I railroads have become mere bureaus of the general staff. The roads are gov ernment owned and wholly militarized, , as is well known. For a time a pre tense of continuing the general busi- , ness of the first two years of the war was kept up. The freights were listed | under three heads: War freight. Contributory war freight. Freight of the usual civilian charac ter. War freight was given preference, of course. Next to it came the "con tributory" freight, such as raw ma terials for munitions and food for the people. In this connection civilians are considered as "war material." Un less they are kept in condition to work the army must eventually fail to func tion. Last of all came the freights of a purely civilian character, such as baby carriages and brooms and table 1 china and mahogany bedsteads. If there were room and freight cars left, this class of freight was hauled. It is still on the classified list, but the Germans have given up the effort to ship It. 1 There are not men enough in Ger manv, outside of those engaged in war, to handle this freight. Nor are the German railroads in condition to han- I die it. The demands of war are ex hausting them. Germany's supply of valid men has been completely taken j over for the army. Boys of Eighteen at the Front. Boys of sixteen and one-half years of I age are now taken from their homes and schools and sent to barracks for I the year's drill and disciplining they must have before they are sept into the lone of active operations. If is doubt- I ful if boys less than eighteen years of age ever reach the real front lines. I They are not stiff enough morally and mentally at that age to stand the I frightful grueling of war under mod-1 em conditions. Men are taken for the 1 army up to fifty years of age. They I are taken between fifty and fifty-five I years of age for soma forms of civilian service. Over fifty-five they are still [free to die comfortably in their beds of dysentery induced by underfeeding or pneumonia induced by weakness plus chill. i It is practically impossible for a valid German man to escape service. Every German in U. S. Dae in Army Every German in the United States I today is due in the German army. The time will come when he must ex- I plain to his imperial master why he I did not wear the green gray of the German army. Germans in the United fitates will be forgiven?or many of them will? because of the impossibility of getting to Germany across a well guarded I sea. But here in Switzerland no such protection avails them. I have been told of cases in which men have been | mulcted of all they possessed, of well to-do men who have been reduced to I penury because thev refused to go | back to Germany to do their military 1 service. The empire can only reach I property actually located in Germany, of course. But these men can never return to Germany except upon a I proper and well paid for permission. I It Is quite clearly understood that one of the sources of revenue Ger-1 many hopes to tap after the war Is I the fat pocketbook of the Germans I resident In the United States and who , have been paid good wages or made | rich profits during the period of the war. They must pay If ever they hope | to go back. Woman Problem Will Be Serious. Women are worklnr at almost every sort of Job In Germany today from cleaning streeta to running lathes In shell factories. The "woman problem" is one of the Innumerable problems of after the war which even now are growing permanent wrinkles In the foreheads of thoughtful Germans. Four years ago the typical German woman was the hausfrau. The kaiser's three Ca?cooking, church and children? bounded her activity and her culture. Germans say the German woman will never go back to the three Cs. "Women working on the Berlin trams fainted from sheer weakness," one man told me. They struck for more food and got It. No Civilian Employes. "To show the complete manner in which the voluntary qjvil service has taken up the supply of males outside the mobilized lines," a friend told me. "I can cite my own experience. I se lected a one-legged office boy because he promised permanency. But after a time he was called to sit at a factory door to check the women in and out morning and evening. A Pole used to give me a German lesson every morn ing. He was a little, weazened chap, obviously unfit for work, but before I left Germany he was carrying ? letters four hours a day. I tried to find a clerk to fill a temporary need, but I was un able to find one who had not some "voluntary civil service' interest. I fancy It would have been quite un comfortable for any one to try to evade this so-called voluntary but really drafted service." A similar economy In the use of the human material may be observed In the manner in which the fragments of men that come back from the war are being utilized. I am not referring here to the very remarkable relief work. In which crippled men are being taught to make themselves self-supporting. This is really a part of the machinery which is being gradually created In Germany to meet the after-the-war conditions. The present-day need la such that men who have been k> seriously injured that they would be permanently discharged from duty in any of the allied armies are still doing a man's part. The German theory l> a simple one. The soldier needs two arms and two legs, aa well as other physical equip ments. A man can keep books without legs, however, and at a pinch with only one arm. A one-legged man not only can be, but very often Is, a most com petent aerial observer. Men are used about the various affiliated services who have been deprived of the us* of on* or more limbs and sometimes ar* suf fering from very serious wounds. Nor Is great consideration shown the** man because of their physical condition. The German theory is that if the wounded man is petted and favor*d h* Is tker* by softssM. and that he promptly oesaes to 4* ?tm what h* can da watt. German prisoner* of war building; roads at Haute-Snr-Marae, France. There's no slacking here; every one must do his hit, willing: or nnwlllinf. If France most keep and support these captives she at leant makes them earn their salt. c?? him than he can possibly do, he will do more than he would possibly do under a more lenient system. The governmental policy is designed not merely to check extravagance and ' waste, but so to lessen demand that the smallest number of workers possi ble must be subtracted from the total available to the national need. The consequence is that just what food is absolutely needed is manufactured and just what cloth may not be done with out. The coal supply promised for this winter is less than one-half that need ed against normal demands, and that after all electric sign and show win dow lighting has been prohibited. Germany has plenty of coal, but she lacks men to work it. Every Ounce of Energy for War. In summing up, it may be said with out exaggeration that every ounce of energy possessed by Germany today is directed toward the one purpose?that of fighting out the war. All the external things which make life pleasant have been cast aside. The whole n&tion is fighting in a sense which is not equally true of any allied nation, and which it is to be hoped need never become true of any one of them. These things must be realized by America, together with the fact that Germany's advantageous position and her thorough initial preparation enable her to get a greater value from each foot-pound expended than can any of the allied nations. Germany is despondent and overtax ed and undernourished and overworked to an extent that cannot be compre hended except by some measure of per sonal contact. She fears the future In a fashion that cannot be exaggerated. But as yet Germany Is not ready to quit. biportaat Ckuse In Schedule. Soothers Railway System.

RAILWAY ADOPTS PLAN TO ELIMINATE WASTE , t Lackawanna Company Provides "War-Timeii Menus for Its Dining Cars,' Which. Prove Popular. "Eliminating waste by' making the Quantity of food lit the appetite of the individual." This is one of the policies adopted by the Lackawanna Railroad Company in co-operating with the government in the food conservation movement. This railroad has adopted a "war-time" menu for its dining trains, which has proven so popular that 83 per cent of all the meals served contain "war por tions," It is said. The "war-time" order contains from one-half to two-thirds the quantity of the regular portions, and costs less than the regu lar portion. This company decided to make in ducements to the patrons of Its dining cars to save on meat, wheat and sugar, to Increase their eating of vegetables, and at the same time to be satisfied that the road was not taking advan tage of the situation to make extra profits. _ The policy Is to offer at the same time two different portions of. each order?the old portion at the old . price and a new two-thirds portion at a two-thirds price. The varieties' of vegetable orders has been increased and the meat dishes decreased.' it is claimed. . NAVAL "RTLT. AFTER BECESS. Bat House Committee Meets Next Week to Act on Other Measures.

MAY FORCE ACTION By JOHN F. BASS. Cablegram to The Evening- Star ?nd Chicago Daily News. Copyright, 1917. PARIS, France, December 8.?The American commission led by Sol. T. M. House is showing: great activity in getting: hold of the general situation, the gravity of which the members recognize. The Joint conference will consider among other things unity of command and the Russian situation. It is acknowledged here that the Rus sian case is seemingly hopeles because of the systematic work done by Ger man propagandists, who now virtually control the Lenine government- The adhesion of the Ukrainian roda to the Lenine organization is a further blow to the allies. It' is recognized now that the en tente powers have neglected the Rus sian field where they ought, like Ger many, to have had several thousands of Poles and Bohemians and Russians, those in America, France and England, working to explain the allies' position to the people. Secret Treaties Affect Situation. The revelations in regard to secret treaties between the entente nations have, moreover, had a most disastrous effect on the attitudes of the smaller nationalities, especially the Poles, whose committee here calls attention to the fact that on January 22, 1917, President Wilson made his famous declaration that all the statesmen of the entente were in favor of giving Poland her independence, whereas on March 9, following an agreement be tween a representative of France with the czar, France was to have Alsace Lorraine. and under certain conditions the west bank of the Rhine was to be turned into a buffer state. This agree ment was followed later by one giving the czar the exclusive right to settle the Polish question. From the Polish point of view this action was bartering their freedom for concessions on the western front. It I will take rapid action and a radical declaration on the part of the entente to prevent the Poles from being swung into line for the central powers. It is pointed out that a Polish army is be ing formed in Russian Poland, which, under present circumstances, might swell the Austro-German forces. Elements Might Be Combined. In Rum la there still exist certain ?lements -which might be combined by the entente into a military force If a. proper declaration of war aims were made public. There is a national Polish army corps in Russia. Around this some of the thousands of soldiers and officers. Including generals, of Polish nationality, might be grouped. In ad dition there are numerous Polish and Bohemian war prisoners practically free in Russia. There are also the Cossacks and Rumanians. The elements, if the entente Is prepared to declare in favor of the right of the small na tions of eastern Europe to decide their own destinies for self-government, might be formed into a lighting group. If something is not done Russia and the Slav countries will inevitably drift Into the Austro-German camp, where they will furnish active help, instead of passive resistance as heretofore. See Time to Cite Purposes. Those onlookers who are not influ enced by national policies feel that it Is high time that the entente powers abandoned their Imperialistic alms and came out with a declaration of war -jfurpofces' which. would recognize the right to self-government of the smaller nations which have national unity and are unwillingly subjected to external rule, as Bohemia, for example. These nations have real importance In the ?war. Their combined population is 40, 000.000. 1 The gravity of this question is that the present drift of the Slav block of nations toward Austria and Germany brings the, latter one step nearer prac tical victory and virtual domination of Europe. Even now it may be too late to remedy the entente mistake in falling to take all measures to pre vent Russia and the Slav countries from drifting away from the entente powera with whom their real interest lies. Slav Snpport Important. It cannot be denied that Slav sup port is of the first importance if the allies are to attain their war aims. Everybody in France sees the neces-! sity of a unified command of the al lied "armies. Individual national offen sives are seen to have little effect on I the1 final outcome of the war because they do not strain the Austro-German resources as a united offensive would do. The present method will merely enable Austria and Germany to deal with the allies one by one by concen trating their resources for that pur pose. , Moreovei\ynIty of command is neces sary for the effective distribution of the American resources among the sil lies to suit an accepted strategical war plan. If there is no unity of command to decide, the nations will each strug gle to vet as much as they can out of America. :_The resources would be wasted without securing the desired re sults. Weed of Concerted Action. In th* same way permanent machln Te?w .juli ed. Occasional meetings of prime min isters do not in any way answer the demand of the situation. The neglect of the Russian developments is trace able to this lack of permanent au thority sufficient to give unity to en tente policy and action. Today no one is responsible for the common inter ests and action. Each nation follows its own policy. Each nation has its own war-aims. Even today the situation in Switzer land is very seripus. German agents with ample funds' have done their wortc among the extremists and socialists to produce disorganization in the state and dissatisfaction in the army. Ger man military engineers are also at work over the country. The feeling exists here that the next German drive may come through Switzerland against France. Speculation is rife concerning Swiss action if Germany attacks. Conditions in Germany, and especially in Austria, are worse than with the entente so far, and drive the armies to a renewed effort to end the war. There fore we may expect the Austro-Ger mans to deliver renewed blows on the western front, especially since many Austro-German troops are now re-' leased from the Russian war zone. Hope is expressed that the confer ence will be the forerunner of ail au thoritative body and of less accidental meetings than in the past. The mat ters that have to be considered are continually changing and cannot be handled by, spasmodic deliberations of the chief statesmen of the entente who are conducting the war. Many should be spared from the routine of govern ment and politics at home to confer adequately concerning questions of united action, on which the success of the allies depend. Newspapers here complain that the allies have jdone little in Switzerland to counteract the work done by Ger man agents. It is conceded that America in the present situation holds the master hand and has the power to bring about closer unity and force a single united command.

In his recent message to Congress President Wilson stated that in order to push our great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion we must clear away with a thorough hand all impediments to success, and added "the very embarrassing obstacle that stands in our way is that we are at war with Germany, but not with her allies." He recommended that we de clare war on Austria, and added, "the same logic would lead also to a decla ration of war against Turkey and Bul garia." But inferentially and for rea sons not apparent he advised against i such action. The President is entirely right in stating that our failure hither to to declare war oh the allies of Ger many has been a very embarrassing obstacle to our success, and he is en tirely right in advising & declaration I of war against Austria. Advocated Policy Six Months Ago. Incidentally, I wish to point out that this is precisely what I insisted upon in these columns two months ago and what I had elsewhere advocated six months ago, and it is worth while re membering that the administration papers then assailed me for urging the course which, although there has not been the slightest change in the situa tion, the President now urges. There was no justification whatever for fail ure to declare war on Austria when we declared war on Germany, and there is now no justification for failure to de clare war . on Bulgaria and Turkey when we declare war on Austria. No Use in Pour Bites at Cherry. There In no use in making four bites of a cherry. There is no use in going to war a little, but not. much. The President has sent a message pledging support to Rumania, but it is worse than an empty form to send such a message unless we forthwith declare war on Bulgaria. The President has appointed a Sunday for the epeclal ex pression of sympathy with Armenia, but such expression of sympathy is utterly meaningless unless we. go to war with Turkey. The Austro-Hun garian and Turkish empires must be broken up if we intend to make the world even moderately safe for democ racy. There must be a revived Poland, taking in all the Poles of Austria, Prus sia and Russia; a gVeater Bohemia, taking in Moravia and the Slovaks; a great Jugoslav commonwealth, includ ing Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herze govina, while the Rumanians in Hun gary should become part of Rumania and the Italians in Austria part of Italy. Nightmare for All Civilizations. The Turk must be driven from Europe and Christian and Arab freed. Only in this manner can we do justice to the subject peoples tyrannized over by the Germans, Magyars and Turks. Only in this way can we remove the menace of German aggression which has be come a haunting nightmare for all civilizations, especially in the case of small, well behaved liberty-loving peo ples. By declaring war on Germany's allies we do not commit ourselves to asking anything that is not just for our own allies, but by failing to declare war on Germany's allies we ourselves are guilty of injustice to our own allies.
