It I Said That Hie List Was Obtained at the Request of n Shrewd Asent and bold to Pat- , ent Medicine Men for Die Sum. LRft on s The most serious charge evpr made against the head of the public school sjs tcm of Kansas City and as serious a charge. In some respects, as could posslblj he made became common property at last ' night's meeting of the Jackson County Judical Society In the Ridge building. The rumors hae been current for -weeks and the scandal has grown to such pro portions that the medical society, in the interests not only of Its members, but the whole community, proposes a searclng in vestigation. Tho charges are, plainly, that the public schools hae been prostituted through the superintendent at their head, .In tho in terest of tho proprietors of a proprietary Temedy, usually known as a "patent med icine." That upon Professor Greenwood's direct order teachers, through the princl rals in each school, were forced to givo a list of names not only of pupils, but of their brothers and sisters not in school, who were dull of comprehension, deficient in Intellect and -with stunted or deformed bodies, and the names and addresses of their parents. It is said some of the prin cipals protested, but tho superintendent was firm; it Is said some of the teachers realized tho enormity of the offense of compiling such a list and rebelled, but the principals pointed to the order of the su perintendent. ' Tho questions -were palmed oft under tho ' guise of "Pedagogics." In reality, the charge is, they -were suggested and written by a book agent on intimate terms -with the superintendent, and In the interests of a patent medicine. Tho list, -which con tained 1,000 names, -was sold, presumably at a high price, to one patent mediclno firm by this agent. The further charge Is made that ono firm, at. least, has already sent circulars and printed matter to hundreds of tho parents of these children. Commer cially this llstof deflcient Kansas City children is of immense -value to a certain class of business. That such a list could be obtained in such a -way and In any man ner become rroperty to be used for such a purpose ctms almost incredible. A committee, consisting of Drs. W. F. Kuhn. Ais Smith and K. W. Schauffler. was appointed by the medical society last night to thoroughly investigate the charges and report to tho llrst meeting of the society in January. Some of the most prominent phsslcims in tho city attended tho meeting last night and denounced In unsparing terms thejap parently successful effort to make tlio public schools an Intelligence office for the distribution of pajent medicines. Tlie Resolutions. The following resolutions, offered by Dr. W. F. Kuhn, were adopted, with one dis senting vote, after a long discussion: "Whereas, A report has been freely cir culated throughout tho city, and especially among the medical profession, that tho publio schools of Kansas City have been made the channel for the introduction of certain medicines among the people; that a list of question", under the guise of pedagogics, has been sent to the principals of the schools, requiring the teachers of these schools to furnish the names and ad dresses of the pircnts of children suffering from certain maladies; that this list of questions was Instigated bv the agent of this remedy and that the answers thereto, irlvlnir such names and addresses, have been furnlnhed to this agent, who has in turn mailed his circulars and literature to the families whose addresses he has thus obtained; and, "Whereas, Such list of questions his compelled the teachers of our public schools to Inquire into the private matters of the families of the patrons, and to give names and addresses, both of children who are and are not attending school. In reference to such special maladies, and, "Whereas, Such reports are placing our Fchools on the level of an advertising agency nnd prostituting them from their lawful position to a mere intelligence of tlce: and, "Whereas. Wo are loath to believe thit such methods are in practice. The stand ing of the public schools and those who hao them In elnrge are above such nefar rlous methods; therefore. Im it "Itesolvcil. Tint a committee, consisting of three members of the Jackson County Medical Society, be appointed to Investi gate such charges and reports, and report the truth or falsltv of the samo at the llrst stated meeting in January." Greenwood's Blank to Principals. Dr. Kuhn, In speaking to his motion to adopt tho resolutions, read the following questions sent to school principals, bearing tho signature of Superintendent Green wood: CIRCULAR OF INFORMATION. To the Principals. 1. Number of pupils who have failed to be promoted from mental causes. 2. Number from phssical causes. 3. Have ou pupils who are behind oth ers of tho samo age? 4.

Please FUbmlt a written statement on or before October 23. IS7. Itepectfullv. J. M, GREENWOOD. October 12, 1SS7. Dr. Kuhn Talks PInlnI. These reports are abroad." said Dr. Kuhn, "but I do not want to give them credence or even publlcits' until their truth jhas been established. Tho report is that 4.600 names have been secured through the teachers, and it goes, without Easing that these pirents will be flooded with all tho quack literature in the country, for these names have been sold, and thes will be sold to more than one quack. If this method has been sanctioned by the gentleman who Is charged with having ordered this Infor mation to be collected. It is a contemptible proceeding, and we should investigate it to tho bottom. I mention no names. The questions mas be forgeries, but one report is that the man who got them and sold them boasted that thev had been copied verbatim et literatim as he wrote them.1' Dr. Fulton opposed a report to the so clets and advocated the pre-cntation of whatever evidence was secured to the board of education. Dr. Kuhn opposed this suggestion, and went more Into detail regarding the charges. "I do not criticise the remeds'. but the method," he said. "This is advertising the names of parents who have children unfor tunately afflicted. The teachers made up these reports, and they went into the hinds of this agent. I have In my pocket copies of the circulars which have been mailed to rr.ms' of these parents. I am told that the agent called at one or more of the school buildings to get tho list for that school, and declared openlv that thej- belonged to him. tbough ordered by this gentleman high In authority" . . Dr. II. Von Quast declared the questions were plainly asked, not to collect statistics, but to advertise a patent medicine remedy. In There a ItnUeoflr Dr. Leros Dibble minced no words in ex pressing his opinion. "We are taxpasers," he declared, "and we pay our teachers to teach the children in the schools, not to introduce quack rem edies. This man's name is signed to theso questions, and It is not the first time ho has done the same thing. Some time ago a man wroto a book which this mm rec ommended to tho teachers, and practically ordered tho teachers to buy it. Let's call a spado a spade. Is there a rake off? This pur. has not only a clt- and state, but a national reputation, and sct he Is apparent 1 using methods that would shame tho lowest quack on earth. These names are worth $50 per thousand and thes- cm bo old many times over. The parents will be pestered with advertisements from every quack remeds- in tho countrs. and the children will have this thins follow them through life. This advertising of these things to quacks is simply absurd, but it has been going on for sear- If these charges are true, the'person respon sible for this outrage should be discharged and we should get somebods who will not turn our schools into a patent medicine ad vertising ngencs." Dr. Fulton was afraid of hiving it known that tho doctors were fighting quacks, in timating that the newspapers would crit icise the recuiar phvsiciins "because tho quarks are advertisers " "We aro not fighting quacks," declared Dr. Dibble. "This m in who got the names Is not a phv iclan. He Is simply a drummer out of a job." Dr. Kuhn advised the societv to go Iow and mae no charges until the truth of the reports had been investigated t,hor oughis. Tho remedv which. It Is claimed, has been advertised through the public schools is one made from the thsroid and other gl inds and nerve centers of sheep, and the most charitable construction plaeed upon tho matter is that the superintendent merely had the wool pulled over his eves, as in his jeliovv kid journalism enterprise. NATIONAL GUARD NEEDS. Colonel Groin Telia How Missouri Is Behind the Times in Supporting- Her Militia. Colonel George P. Gross, of tb Trj'd regiment, returned yesterdas' morning from St. Louis, where he attended the interstate conference of national guird officers. Tues das and Wednesdas. "The meeting was called l5' Adjutant General Bell, of tills state. Seventeen states wero represented by their national guard ofticers, and many others bs letter. An association of national guardsmen was organized and will meet next sear In Chicago. The meeting wa3 a vers enthusiastic one, and it is expected that much favorable legislation can be se cured for the citizen soldiers" of the country through the new organization. Congress will be asked to appropriate $2 000,000 a s'ear towards the suport of tho national guard, in place of $400,000, as now. "A Missouri officer of tho national guard Is almost ashamed to admit that he is what ho is when he meets ofllcers from other states." said Colonel Gross. "Hero wo are, the fifth state in the Union, and pet prnctlcalls' no support from the state for our national guard. We get $10,000 a sear to bo divided between four regiments and tho batteries. The Iowa national guard gets $-j0,M0: California, with only hilf tha number of enlisted men that we have, gives $100 000; Illinois gives $150,000; Wiscon sin. $110000: the little state of New Jersey; $171,000, and so thes run. In place of being encouraged to build up our national guard, we In Missouri have to carrs" around sub scription lists and beg money from the business men in order to pay even our armors rent." Colonel Gross said he confldentls expect ed congress to make tho appropriation asked for. Yesterday morning Colonel Gros Issued an order for an offlcers' meeting to be held at headquarters next Tuedasr night. Next Thursdav night the Second battalion under command of Mijor Fleming, will drill at the armors, and on the following Tuesdav night the First bittilion under command of Major Kelses. will drill.

COTTON CLOSE AT HAND, ALSO, AN.D TAXATION LIGHT. Bis Reduction In New Enclnud WaKes Necessary to Put 31111s There on an Equal I'ootliiB With Those of South ern States. Boston, Mass., Dec. 9. Although Bos ton Is the center of the cotton mill busi ness of New England, the men prominent ly connected with tho trade would have little to sas" concerning the action of tho Fall River manufacturers in voting to re duce wages, beginning Janu.irs 1. The treasurer of ono of the Fall River mills, who was willing to discuss the matter, said ho regarded tills cut as a beginning of a serious time, not only for the Fall River print mills, but for all the cotton mills In New England. The kes to the whole situation, ho said, is the relitive cheapness of Southern labor, which could not be better shown than bs the fact that it costs a mill in Georgia or North Caio llna J'-c to produce a pound of mateiial, and in New England Cc. With this fact in mind, it is evident that the cut of 10 per cent is not going to help matters much, and tho only thing that will do any good at present will bo a radleal cut of sas 20 to 25 per cent. This would in evitabls bring on a strike, but with a cut of 10 or 11 per cent, he siss, there would be little likelihood of a strike, as the op eratives are well acquainted with the con ditions, and know that a reduction of some kind is necessars. Even this would still leave a difference of about 23 per cent in the cos tof labor in favor of the Southern mills, too great a difference to struggle against successfully In tho llrst place, the Southern mills have every natural advantage thes have cheaper cotton and less burdensome taxa tion. Some of the big mills in Fill River for instance, have a seirls pasment of $10,000, $13,000 and even $20,000 in taxes to make, whereas, in Georgia and North Car olina the mills are, in mmy inst.mces, ex empted from taxes for ten or twelve sears. It is in I ibor, however, that the great dif ference lies. The labor in tho South is as good as it is here, and, taken as a whole, is about 32 per cent cheaper. The laborers have had about ten scars' training in milis started bs experienced cotton m inufactur ers and run under their supervision, and the operatives there attend as mans ma chines and turn out just as good work as would operatives in the best New England mills. Arothcr great advantage the Southern mVls li,J.ve ls,".ntJji br,i'rri'impcrcd bs- leg islation. In Massachusetts the hours of labor aro limited to lifts -eight a week, while in tho South thes aro unlimited. The onls hope for the New Englind mills, ac cording to the speaker. Is either in the im provement in tho print cloth market or In a general evening up of conditions between the North and South.

This was bs far tho best representation of stock ever known at an annu il meeting of the Santa Fc. Then a few prelimin irv- motions were put and President Riples declared the elec tion open. He gave the stockholders ono hour and a half to vote. A recess was de clared for that purpose. It did not take live minutes, however, for the stockiold ers to cast their ballots. As soon as this was done, all of the v's iting railroad magnates went to the To peka Club, as the guests of ex-Goiernor Osborn. for luncheon. The polls were left open until the parts returned. Then the committee appointed to count the votes proceeded with its work. It took only a short time and President Rlples- deel ired the directors receiving the votes elected. No votes were cast for ans- outsiders. Tho old board was re-elected, but placed in groups as given above. There was no contest of ans Kind No bods appeared with a grievance. Evers thing went off as smoothls as possible Secretars Coburn. or the Kmsas state board of agriculture, did not miss an op portunity to advertise Kansas at the meet ing. While it was in progress, each of those present received one of the secre tars 's souvenirs. The souvenir consists of a statement printed on a fine cardboird showing the value of the products raised in Kansas in 1S97. "Look at this: 'Grand total value of all products and live stock. $230 410.143,'" ejic ulated Mr. Nickerson. of Boston. "And $30,000,000 in indebtedness paid oft during the sear." remarked R. Somers Hases, the New York capitalist. "Yes. and more set to be paid when it falls due." responded Charlie Gleed, who can alwass to be found standing up for Kansas "The East has no kick coming on Kan sas," said Mr. Rotch. the Boston capitalist. "Boston never did have. Sh hsi stnnrf by Kansas and Kansas Cits, and sho is

"When Kansas is prosperous, the Santa re is prosperous," put in President Riples. " hat helps one helps the other. It should be the aim of our compans to do evers thing in its power to assist in the upbuilding of this magnificent state." All present said "Amen." The souvenirs were tucked awav bs each in his inside pocket and will be taken back East and framed. The 1 ist act of the directors before leav ing the cits this afternoon was to elect ofllcers for the ensuing sear. No changes were made and the ofllcers re-elected are the following: President. Edward P. Rip les : chairman of the board. Aid ice F. W alker; third v ice president. Paul Morton: secretars and treasurer, Edward Wilder; assistant secretars", L. C Demlng: assist ant treasurer. H.W. Gardner: general coun sel, Victor Morawetz: general solicitor. E. D. Kenna; general auditor If. C. White head, comptroller, J. I'. Whitehead. Ten minutes after the election of the Santa Fo officers, the Topeka Railroad Y. M. C. A. was exactls $30 better off. Under ordin ars circumstances, there- would be no con nection between the Y. M. C. A. and the an nual meeting of the Santa Fe railwas. but this Is how- it happened: Immediattlj after tho last elective .officer v.as voted for. Treasurer" W flder walked around to the eleven members of the board of dlrtctors present and presented eaeli witli $M in gold, the prescribed fee for attendance at the an nuil meeting of the road. As the l.'st director to reeeive the money pocketed the gold, two twenties and a ten. President Riples rapped on the table and Slid: 'Gentlemen. I wish to mike a rather unusual motion before adjournment io taken. I move that each of the members of the board of directors donite to the Topeka Railroad Y. M C. A. an amount equal to their fee for attendince at this meeting. Here is the first donation." and with tho last remark he laid the money presented him on the table in front of Treasurer Wilder. In three minutes more, a pile of gold amounting to $'jT0 was lsing in front of Tre usurer Wilder, while tlie room was ringing with 1 lughter at the unexpected "holdup ' of the chief exec-utl- e of tho road. "Mr. Gleed isn't hero and I hive l.is mones In ms hand," slid Treasurer Wilder, when he could make himself heard abovo tho laughter. "What shall I do w ith it?" "Put it with the rest: Gleed doesn't need it," said President Riplev. and then fresh laughter ensued. Mr. W ilder did so. President Riples stated to-dis that tho directors were greatly pleased with the manner in which the road was being man aged and the outlook of the company in the future. "The properts is in excellent shape." said he. "and evers thing indicates that the Santa Fe will be prosperous. Wo spent about $3(W,000 this last sear in im- firovtng the lines, and. while the boird las not decided dehnitels set how- much to spend next sc r. it will be i bi amount. That question will be settled in January In New York." The partv left this afternoon in a special train for Newton. There it will divide. Some of the directors will go to Califor nia, others to Galveston, whil the rest will accompans President Ripley back East. 

POLICY OF THE COMPANY. Permanent Improvement "So Experi mental Roads Fairness 'No Favoritism. The general policy of the companv, as it Is at present conducted, appears to be ono of extreme conservatism and great fair ness. It seems to be spending money without stint on improvements of a permanent character and in directions where a prop er return is an absolute ccrtaints ; but It Is probabls less willing to build a mil6 of experimental road or spend a dollar on an urcertain venture than almost any com pins in the countrs. The compans aNo shows unmistakabls a full apnreciitlon of its duties ind obll gitions to its cmploses and to the public gcncralls. Everv emplovc and evers" citi zen with ans' compi lint to make can get a lull and fair hearing, a conscientious at tempt to decide justls. and no unhappy contact with brusque and stilted oluiial ism. Evrrv officiil in the sjsteni from the president down, holt's his position on ids merits alone, and not bs anv form of favoritism. This means a thoroughly practical tone. In all the compinv's affilr. A eontinu iiree of the present methods can not fall to preserve for the Santa Ie its old time popularitv, and still further ad vance it in the respect of all who are in ans was related to it.

GENERAL CONDITIONS. President Ripley's Report Yeas Largely Devoted to Preparations for the Future. President Ripley, under the head of "General Conditions." sass: The scar under review has been largely devoted to preparation for tho future. Its cirls months were during a period of con tinued business depression from which no 'positive evidences of recovers wero dis cernible until towards the close of the vear. At the present time the volume of , business is increising. and the earnings of the ssstem for the current fiscal sear bid fair to considerably exceed the earnings for the sear covered bs this report. The relations of the compans to its pat rons and tho communities along Its lines are in the main satlsfictors and harmon ious, with the exception of some unreason- , able demands for the reduction of rates. i The relations of the compins to its com P titors and the general r ite conditions are- as good as cm bo expected under the laws which foster the evils of unrestricted competition and forbid the formation of treasonable agreements. I Acknowledgment is due to officers nnd , empioses for faithful and efficient serv ice. j
