"VOLUME XIV. NO. 291. PRESIDENT WILSON DELIVERS MESSAGE TO JOINT SESSION OF 64TH CONGRESS utlines Legislation He Hopes to En acted by That Body This Session. SUFFRAGETTES HECKLE WILSON DURING TALK Large Yellow Flag With Inscription is Dropped From Balcony by the Women. By ROBERT J. BENDER United Press Staff Correspondent) Washington, Dec. 5.Declaring the country cannot and should not consent to remain further exposed to profound industrial disturbance, President Wilson today appeared be fore a joint session of congress and V, appealed for actionofupon +he settlementimmediate and regulation dif ficulties between railways and em ployes. Following the precedent he estab lished when he first assumed his ex ecutive duties in the White House, President Wilson today appeared be fore congress and personally outlined legislation he hopes to have enacted by that body It was the third time he has addressed the sixty-fourth eongress Because the makeup of the next housle may result in hard sledding for Democratic measures, the presi dent hoped, by his appeal today, to convince this congress of the import ance of immediate action on legisla tion he particularly desires. ^*The executive box in the house gal lery was reserved for Mrs. Wilson and other members of the president's} family. Members of the cabinet also were there. While congress is working on his recommendations the president will Tbe away from Washington but little Should it be necessary he may recom mend that the customary Christmas recesd be dispensed with. This sug gestion has been made already by Speaker Clark and Chairman Fitzger ald? of the house appropriations com ittee There is much to do before March 3, the date of adjournment, if the president's wishes are to be carried out in full at this time and not en trusted to the sixty-fifth congress. The first demonstration by the E*uf fragists, such as heckled the British house of commons, occurred in con gress while the president was read ing his annual message. Soon after he started to read his) address a big yellow banner was dropped by the suffragists from the gallery with the inscription, "President, what will you do for woman suffrage?" President Wilson's address is as follows: Gentlemen of the Congresis: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the Constitution of communicating to you from time to time information of the state of the Union and recommending to your consideration such legislative meas ures as may be judged necessary and expedient I shall continue the prac tice, which I hope has been accept able to you, of leaving to the reports "A*%? several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public stervice and confine myself to those matters of more general public policy with which it seems necessary and feas ible to deal at the present session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time under which you will necessarily act at thtei session and shall make my suggestions as few as possible but there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public to do at once, In the firsit place, it seems to me ^ratively necessary that the earli possible consideration and action */ould be accorded to the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had oc casion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the public dangers disclosed by the unaccommodated difficulties which then existed, and which still unhap pily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers, conductors and trainmen. n*\then recommended: vSt, immediate provision for the Jgement and administrative re anization of the Interstate Com erce commission along the lines embodied in the bill recently passed by the houete of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate 'in order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great fanji various duties now devolving up fon it with a promptness and thor tougnneste which are, with its present constitution and means of action, ractically impossible. I ll Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basKs alike of work and of wages in the employment of all railway employes who are actually engaged in the work of operating trains in inter state transportation. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe the actual re sults in experience of the adoption of the eight-hour day in railway transportation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the congress of the consideration by the Interstate Commerce commission of an increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the railroads as may have been rendered necessary by the adoption of the eight-hour day and which have not been offset by administrative read justments and economies, should the facts disclosed justify the increase. Fifth, an amendment of the ex isting federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provi sion that, in case the methods of ac commodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed be fore a strike or lockout may law fully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgement in the hands of the executive of the power, in case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such rolling stock of the railways of the country as may be required for mili tary use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the United States such train crews* and administrative officials as the cir cumstances require for their safe and efficient use. The second and third of these recommendations the congress imme diately acted on it established the eight-hour day as the legal basis* of work and wages in train service and it authorized the appointment of a commission to observe and report up on the practical results, deeming ^hese the measures most immediately needed but it postponed action up on the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate consideration of them. The fourth recommendation I do not deem it necessary to renew. The power of the Interstate Com merce commission to grant an in crease of raters on the ground re ferred to is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the commission's authority or its* inclination to do justice when there 'S no reason to doubt either. The other suggestionsthe in crease in the interstate Commerce commission's membership and in its facilities for performing it* mani fold duties', the provision fcr f'il public investi^a+irn of industrial disrates, and the grant to the executive of the power to con trol and operate the railways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew The necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing Those who have entrusted us with the re sponsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them in such matters would find it hard, I believe, to ex cuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only does the Interstate Com merce commission now find it prac tically impossible, with its present membership and organization, to per form its great functions promptly and thoroughly but it is not un likely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and-exact ing. It must first be perfected as an administrative instrument. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial dis turbances for lack of additional means of arbitration and concilia tion which the congress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the executive to make immediate and uninterrupted use of the railroads for the concen tration of the military forces of the (Continued on Page Twelve)
