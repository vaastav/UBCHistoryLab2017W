Speaking of Republican rule In Missouri between IKS and 1871, the Globe-Democrat says: -JKTftBoorl. In that comparatlrdj- titter period, wis blewes -rtth by Bar tb best ITnsnrlit manaetment tt has ever known. TUs broad assertion Is followed by a general de rsatM of the amies of the railroads on which the State titU alien. 'Does the Globe think that Missonrians have for gatkea tbe circumstances surrounding the sale of the State' property for one-third of Its face value? The tftobe knows, as does every citizen of Missouri, that tlst.rallroad which received aid from the State were sold onder their value by methods which savored of rtaTnptloa.

These are things that Missonrians do not forget. Tim debt that taxpayers are now reducing Is a heritage of Republican finance which permitted the saerimce of tbe State' property at runious prices. If the Globe cites such examples of Republican "good apsac" It M well that Missonrians have memories. THEY ARE IN PARTNERSHIP. Am the material result of the conference between capital ana labor now being held In New York City, the-plan of a working Executive Committee for the ijlhiwl of disputes contains promise of great bene fit to Both. .i-Eock a committee, composed of capable representa tives of the latereal of employer and employe, should asstmdty prove potent In doing away with strikes by pin-Uc the Impositions on the worklngman which arise from the rapacity of corporations and by avert ing the Injury to established businesses Inflicted tlirbagh tbe reckless resentment of labor leaders In times of excited controversy. jz)Wise and well-balanced men, the sort who alone slisold constitute such a committee, know well that labor aad capital cannot afford to antagonize each pother. An Injury to capital la an Injury to labor. A wfoag tafllcted apon labor must In the end be paid fi'c, for by capital. Sustained friendly relations between- ,th two, based upon the Just recognition and malnte- of the rights of both, can be established and laatlnr. to the vast profit of all concerned.

The problem is,. after all, the of business propositions. Labor and capital partners la the world of trade and Industry. One get along without tbe other. Each Is entitled Us rights.

REDEEM MISSOURI. Republican organs will make little party capital out of the meager results of the Cutlwell depositions. Judge Priest preferred In 189S that the Democratic party should continue In control of Missouri, though he had not been a supporter of Mr. Bryan In 1&M. His action merely shows that he agreed with nine out of ten Democrats who had held similar opinions on the chief national issue. He contributed and collected money for the State campaign as he had done before. The fact prove nothing to his discredit, to that of the State Committee or to that of Mr. Seibert. That the Democratic brewers gave half what the Republican brewers had given to the Republican campaign cer tainly proves nothing which organs like the Globe will care to use strenuously. That Colonel Phelps helped out a poverty-stricken campaign fund with $2,000 only proves that he gave about one-tenth of what he might have given out of pure gratitude for undeserved political honors past and to come. There Is no party gain in a beating of tin pans over the Cardwell depositions. There is party loss in a transparent silence over the well-known Jefferson City truth that Republican legislators are Invariably closer than Democratic legislators in alliance with the lobby. Missouri voters will never turn to the Re publican organization for Improvement as long as the mouthpieces of the party practically announce that the lobby-ridden crowd ore to be defended and per petuated In Republican legislative nominations. Party capital can be made only by honest and ag gressive efforts to purge Jefferson City of the lobby and the sandbagger. The Republic does not argue from the standpoint of party advantage when it says that honest and ag gressive measures among Democrats in 1000 led to an Immense Improvement in the House of Representa tives at the last session. The Democratic party or ganization realized that public opinion would not be satisfied without a genuine strengthening of character and ability on the majority side. Efforts were put forth in all the counties to meet the public demand, and the efforts succeeded. Republicans should profit by the example. If they cannot at least equal the Democrats In demonstrated and practical reform, material of more weight than the Cardwell depositions will be of no advantage. Missouri Is a Democratic State and will never saddle Republican power upon Itself as long as the faults of the Democratic State management are paralleled, in tensified, multiplied, upheld and rewarded on the other Bide. Next year the Democratic party of Missouri will set itself to the task of doing hi the Senate what It has done in the House. There are Democrats in the Senate who should not be there. There are a few Democratic Senators whose connection with lobby and sandbagger plots is something more than sus pected. That much the Democratic party acknowl edges with regret but without concealment or pallia tion. These men the Democracy proposes to replace with better men if It can. The Republic sincerely be lieves that it is now describing the earnest Intention of the strongest and most influential party leaders. But almost the whole body of Republican Senators are tainted with lobby and sandbag influence. That is not a bare assertion. The Republic challenges the Globe to select any measure passed in the last two sessions and call It a test lobby or sandbag measure. On any measure so selected by the Globe we will compare party votes in the Senate. If the comparison does not show a deplorable situation on the Republic an side of the Senate, The Republic will admit pub licly its mistake. In a campaign against the lobbyists and sandbag gers all the' better elements of both parties should be united. And The Republic takes occasion here to say that there Is going to be a campaign against these gentry not a campaign of gentle sermonizing after all the harm Is done, but one which begins right now, which goes Into every county and which will teach the voters what they are doing before as well as after legislative nominations are made. Republicans have the advantage of being the party of opposition and criticism in the State government situation. They have the disadvantage of not having shown the slightest desire or capacity to strengthen the moral character and ability of their legislative nominees. Democrats have shown within two years both desire and capacity. Before the people Republic anism Is In a hopeless position of self-confessed un worthlnesa. In that position they will remain until they turn over a new leaf. Why not cultivate popular confidence by beginning now a genuine reformation? An opposition party would Jump at the chance if the organization which directed its action were actuated by a semblance of decent political Impulse. There Is nothing but Jabber in exaggerating Cardwell depositions when every voter in Missouri knows, through recorded proof, that tbe Republican minority In the Senate Is rotted with long continued lobby association. Unless the Re publican organization con Inspire confidence In its promises it cannot hope to capture the State offices. If it will do something It may get something. properly providing for the construction of an all American canal, was heartily Indorsed by the people. The Indorsement was based upon a clear understand ing of the situation. The Senate is to be congratulated on the wisdom of Monday's action, and those Individual Senators who opposed the treaty but voted nevertheless in obedience to the popular will have properly performed their duty to the country. They have bowed to au authori ty higher than Individual conviction and to an intelli gence safer than Individual opinion. The spirit which led to such a course is peculiarly the Amcricau spirit. 1 which instinctively regards the voice of the people as supreme. The bill providing for the construction of the NIcaraguan Canal, the route recommended by the Isthmian Canal Commission, should now be promptly Introduced and, if satisfactory in all details, as promptly passed. There is reason for sincere popular gratiflcatlon that this stage of the movement for an American canal has been reached. Public !eutinient will approve tho vigorous prosecution of tlio enter prise to a successful finish. THIS WOMAN MARRIED ACATH0LIC PRIEST MAKE HER FEEL AT HOME. When Miss Helen Gould visits St Louis during the early days of the new year now about to hein ulie should by all means be brought to a pleasant realiza tion of the high esteem in which she is held by tho people of the World's Tair City. The proposed reception In her honor will be au ex cellent way of accomplishing this desirable end. So suitable is the suggestion that arrangements for the function should be carried forward with the greatest vigor ""rt nothing left undone to make St. Louib's en tertainment of Miss Gould all that It should bo as a testimonial of distinguished regard. The good woman thus to be honored eminently de serves the honor. As a type of the patriotic American gentlewoman she Is singularly satisfactory. Unlike many other New York women who have allowed their Anglomania to make them more English than Ameri can, Miss Gould was more eager to minister to the needs of American soldiers In our war with Spain than to those of British soldiers in England's war against the two Republics of South Africa. Sho spared neither money nor time nor personal effort in her mission of helpfulness to the men who fought un der Old Glory for the freeing of Cuba. Miss Gould's special friendliness to St Louis also calls for a response In kind. She has taken pains to emphasize the fact of her interest in the affairs of this city. She was glad and proud to accept a position on the Board of Lady Managers of tho World's Fair. Her fellow-members on that board, and all tbe people of St Louis, should see to It that Miss Gould feels eminently at home and with friends when she finds herself in tho World's Fair City. As a common-sense business proposition the man agement of the St Louis Transit Company should recognize the necessity for a better and safer service In street railway transportation than Is now being furnished to the people of St. Louis. From the stand point of dollars and cents, leaving considerations of humanity out of the question, they cannot afford an Increased casualty record for tbe sake of being en abled to run fewer cars at a higher rate of speed than would be necessary if the proper number were brought Into use. Neither can they afford to antagonize pub lic sentiment. The Transit Company has much to lose by a continued disregard of the rights of the community. An Improvement of service based on a wise recognition of this truth is emphatically in order. Young Cornelius Vanderbllt, who has served an arduous apprenticeship to become a practical loco motive engineer and builder, and who Is now willing to enter the public service in New York as a Civil Service Commissioner, represents the highest type of the wealthy young citizen. The pity Is that he con stitutes an exception to the rule, even In this demo cratic country, and that bis case Is so rare as to ex cite wondering comment coincident with admiration.

Philadelphia is to have a new Postmaster and The Bepubllc congratulates its people upon the admirable nomination President Roosevelt has sent to the Sen ate. Colonel Clayton McMIchael will make a good Postmaster, because he has been eminently success ful in every position of responsibility he has occupied, and he has been called to many in a life of excep tional activity. Political appointments are seldom received with such uniform approval's has been evoked in Phila delphia by the nomination of Colonel McMIchael, but public men are not often so invariably fair in their partisanship as he has always been. His career gives gratifying evidence that it is possible to be absolutely true to party and yet retain the respect and confidence of political opponents. Philadelphia's new Postmaster will be an unmis takable Republican in office, just as he would be out of office, but if intelligence, industry and impartiality can avail to further the Interests of the community neither Democrats nor Republicans will be able to de termine by the administration of the great business machine of which he has charge what his political predilections are. NOW FOR THE 

CANAL BILL. By the almost unanimous ratification of the Hay Panncefote treaty authorizing the construction of an isthmian canal wader conditions which insure Ameri can control the Senate again testified to the potency of American public sentiment as influencing the action of that representative body. The new treaty deserved ratification In the exact proportion In which the original Bay-Paancefote con vention on the canal question merited defeat. The latter was woaapUj recognised by the American peo ple as as unwarranted grander of American rights aitf for thurassen the Sens rafneed to ratify. The th OsrtBn-BatwBr tasty, and Like one of those contemned rabbit dogs which "holler" every minute but never find game, the Globe Democrat Is vocal but unprogressive on the trail of Cardwell's "Brown." It has been shown that the Globe is closer than any other newspaper to the Card well hand. The Republic particularly would be grati fied if the Globe would kindly oblige with Informa tion as to "Brown's" Identity. Who of the Globe's gang of renegades sent "Brown" to Kansas City? RECENT COMMENT. Lobhylata aad Sandbasaerm. Xuuh Cltr WsrU (IndtEendcnU. The Cardwell suit suggests something for the publto to consider and the public service corporations to act upon. The corporations complain that they are compelled to use money to prevent them?eKes from beta? "held up" by the Legislatures of the different States. Their ofllcials tell us that dishonest men secure themselves to bo elected to the Legislature for the sole purpose of levying blackmail on the corporations. In this there la no doubt a certain degree of truth. It Is also true that many of the men that are employed as lobbyists and who help to elect such officers, and the officers themselves being n holly without character to start with, do use the'r positions for the sole purpose of making money. It Is further true that the lobbyists and members of the Legislatures who are In the pay of one corporation will try by vexatious and unjust legislation to make money out of other corporations that do not own them. They are at best a disreputable, despica ble and degraded lot. Uniform statements of assets and liabili ties will be required of all corporations It the suggestion of the St. Louis Society of Accountants and Bookkeepers Is carried out. At Its meeting last night In the Odd Fellows' building the society considered what form It would recommend, but final action was deferred until last meeting. "Under present conditions, a corporation's statement of its condition may or may not recal the whole truth." sold President C A. Sweetland In explaining the movement. "The society feels that great benefit, bota to creditors and stockholders of corpora tions would follow the adaption by law of a certain form for making the statements. This Is so obvious that President Roosevelt In his message to Congress said that the only way of curbing the trusts Is to requlra publicity concerning their aiTalrs. "When the form Is approved by the so ciety, copies will be sent to the Congress men and all other societies included in the National Assaclatlon of Accountants and Bookeepers. We will urge each of these societies to call the attention of their rep resentatives In Conrress to the importance of such legislation. We wlU try. too, to Influence such legislation In tho various States, so that the practice will be uniform the country over." Officers for tho year were elected last night C. A. Sweetland wj re-elected president for his fifth term. The other of ficers are: Vice president, F. J. Splndler; secretary. W. C. ,Hanser; treasurer. J. K. Stone: bookkeeper, D. L Zuker; librarian. Thomas B. Fallenlus. In the course of the evening Mr. Sweet land made ail address on tho workings of the indemnity and savings section of tho X. A. A. B.

With the personal differences of Mr. Walsh and Mr. Seibert the Democracy hate no concern. Tho country Democracy, which has always stood as the Glbralter of Democracy In this State, Is concerned when treason is to be enthroned within the party, and whon traitors are to be detected. The Democrat now eounds the note of warn ing that traitors with'n the party must be summarily dealt with: that the occupation of Mr. Phelps Is and must be a reminiscence. His chief service to the party in recent years has been to Incite the pubLcation In the Globe-Democrat of this State of articles which challenge the honesty and Integrity of the party, and when o engaged, has been to peddle to the Globe-Democrat information which he had secured In a confidential way of the campaign of the Democratic part-. lie has no right to rail himself a Demo crat nor to affiliate with the party. He no longer has any political or other standing with the Democratic leaders of this State. '11 Publicity. Jethrson Cltr Tt'dum. The State Tribune favors the greatest publicity of all the doings of the State Committee. It believes that a law should be passed. If possible, requiring the proceedings of all political committees and all receipts and expenditures of money to be printed. Let nothing be done in a corner, and the electric Ught be substituted for the dark-lantern. This would compel the Republicans to do likewise, and as they spend two dollars wherein the Democrats spend one, and bleed corporations four times as heavily, they would have their sinews of war taken from them, and the Democrats would profit In the end. Urn Relief That TVy. Kansas City Star (Independent. The only cause In the world which the Democratic party of Missouri has for feeling undisturbed over the dis closures of the Cardwell suit Is the knowledge that the Re publican party Is not In a position to take advantage of th valuable capital which this proceeding has placed at its disposal. The most conclusive commentary on the weakness and the Insincerity of the Republican organiza tion In Missouri Is the supremacy of the Democrats. It Is hard lock for a great Stats Ilk Missouri to be under the role of one unworthy party and to be able to entertain ao aopo of relief at the bands of tbe ctber. Elects Officers and Discusses State's World's Fair Exhibit. Sons of Old Kentucky talked lovingly over the recollections of their native State at the Mercantile Club last night, where tho Kentucky Society of St- Louis met for Its annual business session. Between stories, tho mutual Interests of the land of the blue grass and tho World's Fair City were d'jeussed. and Harry B. Hawes proposed that the Kentucky Legis lature should be Invited to a banquet In St. Louis some time In January. A com mittee, of the society has been appointed by World's Talr officials to ask tho Ken tucky Legislature for an appropriation for an adequate exhibit, and It wa9 suggested that tho society might be able to materially aid the project by coming In close personal contact with tho lawmakers. Several of the gentlemen talked, and all were in favor of undertaking some such enterprise. It was urged, however, that the Legislature may be pressed for time and may not be able to come to St. Louis on that account. For this reason it was suggested that It might bo better for the entire society to go. to frankfort ami glvo a dinner there. The question was finally referred to the Board of Directors, at the suggestion 0f General George EL Shields. These officers were elected: Doctor W. G. Moore, president; Harry B. Hawes, W. S.
