WASHINGTON, Dec. parcels post will be one of the most raiport act aabjects that the present con gress will have to deal with,' and the champions of this movement feel con fident that gome definite steps will be taku toward the establishment cf this sjrstera before congress adjourca next March.. The fact, that both President Taft, in his annual message, and. Postmas ttr Genera Hitchcock in his annual report, have recommended the ru ral parcels post, has greatly strength ened .their hopes, - and they believe that II encs a system is established fcr the rural districts, it will only be a' short time- before it is made gen eral. James I. Cowles, founder and sec ictary of tlie Postal Progress League, says that a vigorous campaign will be made thU year in Washingtan to j bring stout the enactment of some perceU post. legislation. "Should we fail he continued, 4iw3 shall urga the president to call a special session 'of tta2nd congress to take up this matter. "Every effort is being made by the members oZ our league throughout the country to bring about the elec tion ct senatcis pledged to a parcels post system. We feel confident that a majority of the house members are in favor of such legislation, and now is our time to make sure of the sen ace. - "A mass meeting is to be held in Cooper Union, New York, Dec. 2J, which will be. addressed by a number of prournent business men, and this will b3 followed by our annual cou Tentiou in February. "At present there are two bills be fore Congress providing for the par cels post system the Bennett bill and the Salzer bill. Our league fa vors the Sulzer bill because-it spec ifies the limit on packages. If this bi'l 13 made a law it will save the people of the country $30,000,000 a year that they are now pajiug to the express companies in excessive rates. Land coEvtrt the annual deficit of the post office department i-nto a hand some profit." Although the sentiment in the house seems generally favorable to the parceU post, there is a strong ractor opposed to it. This is the house committee on post offices and I. oat roadr. 22. 19 In Lr.:nn IZzlzrf. lOl-EdTrta McMasters Ctzrtr. - eacretrry under Llnccia tcr; Eayard Taylor, trmrdcr c3 ca- tor.
