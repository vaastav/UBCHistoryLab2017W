THE INDIANAPOLIS JOURNAL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1892. 0 OBJECTS TO TIIE CORPSES Why the Landlady of a Lodginir-IIouse Euea an Undertaking Firm. HcGInniVs Creditors Strongly Objct-Vn cerou Damage Suits" for Injuries Court Miscellany. Oa May 9 Alice Crawford, proprietress of the Crawford House, oa Wcat Maryland street, tiled salt against Thomas 'Powers, John J. Blaekwell and Martin J. Murphy to enforce the specific performance of a con tract for the execution of a lease fcr the premises occupied by her, and asking 300 damages for an alleged failure upon the part of the defendants to comply with theprovis ions of the contract The complaint al leges that the premises were leased by the plaintiff to bo nsed as a lodging-house and that the defendants agreed to erect an obstruction in tbo building to hide from the view of the roomers the cadavers which were frequently kept in the room nsed by the defendants as a morgue, and which srere plainlv" visible to the roomers. Mrs. Crawford cfaimed that the defendants had cot done this, and endeavored to recover for the failure. Rochford Reardon yesterday filed an answer, attacking the character of the house, and giving that as a cause for their refusal to continue the lease. Other Creditors Object. As soon as the fact that W. II. McGinnis, lumber-dealer, had assigned was known there was a rush among the creditors to get in their claims, and some got left. It seems that McGinnis, who was indebted to Rath born & Co., of Chicago, in the snm of JS.OOO, and, to secure himself against tho debt, had filed a lien with the county re corder, early Monday morning, against the Relt railroad and Union btockyards Com pany npon buildings constructed by them and leased to the Moore Packing Com pany. Levi S. Pierson held the contract for construeting these buildings, and Mc Ginnis furmsbed him lumber and other material used in their erection, the full payment for which. McGinnis states, has sot been received from contractor Pierson, the balance due being JS.0CO. McGinnis, it seems, intended assigning thisto Kathborn & Co., and the paper assigning the lien was also tiled. The creditors, learning that Kathborn & Co. were to be made a pre ferred creditor, held an indignation meet ing at the Denison. and the matter will probably be contested. Bcrglar's Tools on His rerson. In the Police Court, yesterday morning. Thomas M. Holmes was fined 8500 and costs for carrying ooncealed weapons. He was arrested early yesterday morning, on West Washington street, by patrolmen Wilson and Leppert, whose suspicions were aroused by the actions of the man. When searched he was found to have a razor and some burglar's tools upon him, and he is suspected of being the man who baa committed several burglaries in the West End recently. The detectives claim to know him as an old-time "crook." Asks 810,000 Damages. On the 23d day of October, 1891, Horace F. Howell, a driver for the Consolidated Tank-line Company, was injured about the legs and spine in a runaway accident near the Atlas works. In consequence of the in juries he was compelled to have one foot amputated. He alleges he conld have held the horse if the bridle had not broken and he . therefore asks judgment for $10,000 against the Standard Oil Company as suc cessors to the Consolidated Tank-line Com pany. - Wording; of an Insaranee Policy. . "Lidia Newman is suing the Railway vuiciaia anu ciopiarer aociucus Associa-i tion to colleet 2,000 which she claims to be due her npon a policy npon the life of her husband, Frederick Newman. The defense is that Newman met his death while en gaged m work not Jn his regular employ ment. He was a round-house man, em ployed by the Union Railway Company, and met his death while engaged in switch ing. To Attach His Goods. Leopold Mayer has filed enit against Al fred Smith for $3)0 for money alleged to be due on a note and for goods sold. He filed an aflidavit in attachment, alleging that Smith conceals himself so that summons can not be served npon him, and that he is about to remove property subject to execu tion from the State. Bernard Kaufman files under the same salt and asks judg ment on a note for $60. Whs Run Down on the Street. A jury in Judge Bartholomew's court is listening to a recital of the facts npon wthch Mrs. Mary C. Winters bases a claim for damages against Mary C. Lloyd.

Martin against Joseph Schmidt, for medical serv ices to Schmidt's daughter, and the cross complaint of the latter for damages, yester day rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for 124. and found against the defendant on the cross-complaint. Aj-gulng tha Marsh Case. The evidence in the Marsh case is all in, and Prosecutor Holtzman opened the argu ment for the State. He read a number of decisions from the Supreme Court to show that the position of the defense that Mrs. Marsh did not intend to shoot McCoy was ,no justification. 1 Verdict Against Locklear.

HcAuliflee Going to New York to Arranire & Finish Fizht with Barge. The MoAuIiffe combination has no date for next week, and Jack MoAuIiffe, its bright particular star, will seize npon the interim to make a Hying trip to New York for the purpose of closing negotiations with Dick Barge, the English lighter, who is after his scalp. Barge ar rived in New Y.ork Wednesday, and says that he has come to fight and find ohampion Jack only. He appears to be in earnest, is ready to post his forfeit for a finish fight, and the Crescent Clab, of New Orleans, has ottered a 20.000 parse for the go. McAnliffeat first refused to meet Barge, or talk to him, saying that he was doing too well to think of fighting at pres ent, but has subsequently changed his mind. He goes East Saturday night m response to a telegram re ceived personally from Burge, and said yesterday that he thought it probable that the match would be ar ranged, though not for the immediate future, as his theatrical engagements will keep him busy far into the season. McAalifle never took well to training and is too much averse to it to keep in con dition when there is no prospect of a mill in sight. Ho has taken on considerable tiesb, and his "bellows" are not m the best of trim as is shown by even his tame half-minute rounds at the theater. Meyer, his old opponent, got the best of him in their six-round go at Chicago, last Saturday night, and it was said by all present that it was due to Jock's ill condition. He does not desert beer, even when at his training table,' and is drinking more or less at present. Dick Burge is the light-weight champion of England, and is said to be the best in his class from across the water. Compromise of 1850. -w .

It is not quite creditable that the "opposi tion" press discounts so loosely the Presi dent's message. We shall not disgrace a few papers by citing their lan guage. President Harrison sent to Congress one of the best messages placed npon record. It is our national re proach that partisan self-interest should treat with such rancorous nnfair play a message from onr chief magistrate. If it appears that some former, President has been treated In like manner by the party not in power all the more disgrace to "politics' Mr. Harri sion will go on all fair men's reoord as one of the ablest, most impartial, clean and respectable Presidents the Republic has ever bad. Shame on the newspaper hirelings, of whatever party, that put pens in ink bottles of whatever partisan color to discredit publio officials of whatever party regardless of the real issue in a publio event. Shame on the Herald of this city, which appears to be under con tract to misrepresent one of tho sincerest Presidents we ever had. A ballot taken in the office of that paper among editors and printers would promote our present President; but, alas, the "manager'' tones and tinctures opinion from basement to garret of that paper, whioh fact is too trne of almost all papers. Shame on that parti sanism which misleads publio opinion for party purposes! - A Gold Uasls. Philadelphia Worth-American. It is certain that we shall get nothing from them (foreign countries) so long as we put ourselves in the attitude of petitioners and invite them inferentially to come to our relief. They are going to study their own interests, not oars, and until their in terests require them to take hold seriously of the silver question and settle it once for all, they may pat as on the back aud do a little something to keep ns in the humor bf holding silver np, but they will do nothing more. Let as determine that we, too. will aocnmulate and maintain a sufficient gold fund to serve as the basis for our currency, and then if there is not enough gold to go round we shall see who will have to go short of it. It won't be the United States. Suggestion to Singerly. ffew York Advertiser. If Col. William M.

With this sort of backing he cannot fail to get the coveted opportunity to purge the pension rolls. Tiot Measured by Inches. New Tor k Recorder.

A Company May Charge for One Mixer Only, No Matter What the Stove Is Used For. Gpeclal to the Indianapolis Journal. Kokomo, Ind., Dee, 15c The first of a series of suits of the city of Kokomo against the Kokomo Natural Gas and Oil Company for charging in excess of ordinance rates was tried before Mayor Thorne Wednes day, resulting in a victory for the city. The BDeciflo "and only charge against the com pany was that it refused to contract for one stove at the ordinance rate, taking the ground that where a consumer used but one stove the company was entitled to col lect for two, for the reason that the one, was nsed for both cooking and heating purposes. The magistrate, in deciding the case, held that the company could not dictate the number of stoves consumers should use nor collect more than toe ordi nance rate for one mixer, if only one was nsed. As this point is being raised in Indian apolis and many other gas cities, the decis ion in the case will .be ot general interest.

Roth men were eewer contractors, and the trouble arose over Maguire being underbid on sev eral contracts by MeGuire. He has sought every opportunity, to revile and belittle bis ifojinuate rival, and this morning hunted np MeGuire, who was mixing cement, and1 called him a vile name. MeGuire, without a word, struck his tormentor with the blade of a hoe. fracturing the skull and making a. horrible wound, from which eight pieces of bone were removed. He never regained consciousness. MeGuire was arrested. He came here from Logans port four years ago, and is a quiet, peace able man, attending to his own business.

Both plants were owned by the Lafayette company until re cently, when West Middleton people pur chased theirs, with the privilege of atill drawing gas from the pine line. For a week or more the supply has been short At Rus siaville, and the peoole there acoused West Middleton folks (who have the first pull at it) of "hogging" it all and leaving them in tbo cold. The indignation grew to such a pitch that tho superintendent of the plant went to West Middleton and cut oil the short spur line that fed tbat town, extinguishing the fires in all the stoves and stopping the tires in the O. L. Evans flouring-mills. Then it was West Middleton's turn to get mad. A storm of fury raged until the connection was again made, and. should anotber attempt be made, the man nndertaking the job would be mobbed.
