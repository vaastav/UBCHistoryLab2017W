TONOPAH BONANZA SATURDAY. DECEMBER 1. 1906. 7 PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL MESSAGE (Continued from page 6) colliers, torpedo-boat destroyers or torpedo boats, will have to be built also. All this, be It remembered, would not increase our navy, but wouid merely keep it at its present strength. Equally of course, the ships will be absolutely useless if the men aboard them are not so trained that they can get' the best possible service out of the formidable but delicate and complicated mechan isms intrusted to their care. The marksmanship of our men lias so im proved during the last five years that I deem it within bounds to say that the navy is more than twice as effi cient, sliip for ship, as half a decade ago. The navy can only attain prop er efficiency if enough officers and men are provided, and if these offi cers and men are given the chance (and required to take advantage of it) to stay continually at sea and to exercise the fleets singly and above all in squadron, the exercise to be of every kind and to include unceas ing practice at the guns, conducted under conditions that will test marksmanship In time of war. In both the army and the navy there Is urgent need that everything possible should be done to maintain the highest standard for the person nel, alike as regards the officers and the enlisted men. I do not believe that 'in any service there is a finer body of enlisted men and junior offi cers than we have in both the army and the navy. Including the murine corps. All possible encouragement to the enlisted men should be given, in pay and otherwise, and everything practicable done to render the ser vice attractive to men of the right type. They should bo held to the strictest discharge of their duty, if it conduc es to the honor 4md the in terest of the American nation; and in return the amplest consideration should be theirs. West Point, and Annapolis already turn out excellent officers. We do not need to have these schools made more scholasic. On the contrary we should never lose sight of the fact thai the aim of each school Is to turn out a man who shall be above everything else a fighting man. li the army in particular it is not nec essary that either the cavalry or In fantry officer should have special mathematical ability. Probably in licit h schools the best part of the education is the high standard of professional morale which it eonrf fern. Hut in both services there is ur genr need for the establishment of a principle of selection which will eliminate men after a certain age t.' they can not be promoted from the subordinate ranks, and which will bring Into the higher ranks fewer men, and these at an earlier age. This principle of selection will be objected to by good men of medi ocre capacity who are fitted to do well while young in the lower posi tions, but who are not fitted to do well when at an advanced age they come into positions of command and of great responsibility. But the desire of these men to be promoted to positions which they are not com petent to fill should not weigh against the interests of the navy and the country. At present our men, especially In the navy, are kept far too long in the junior grades, and then, at much too advanced an age. are put quickly through the senior grades, often not attaining to these senior grades until they are too old to be of real use In them; and if they are of real use, being put through them so quickly that little benefit to the navy comes from their having been In them at all. The navy has one great advantage over the army In the fact that the officers of high rank are actually trained in the contiual performance of their duties; that Is, in the man agement of the battle ships and ar mored cruisers gathered into fleets. This is not true of the army officers, who rarely have corresponding chances to exercise command over troops under service conditions. The conduct of the Spanish war showed the lamentable loss of life, the use less extrnvgance, and the inefficiency certain to result, if during peace the high officials of the war and navy de part ni"nts are praised and rewarded only if they save money at no matter what cost to the efficiency of the . service, and if the higher officers are given no chance whatever to ex ercise and practice command. For years prior to the Spanish war the secretaries of war were praised chiefly If they pactlced economy; which economy, especially in connec tion with the quartermaster, com missary, and medical departments, was directly responsible for most of the mismanagement that occurred in the war Itself and parenthetically be It observed that the very people who clamored for the misdirected economy In the first place were fore most to denounce the mismanage ment, loss, and'.mfferlng which were primarily due to this stune misdi rected economy and to the lack of preparation it involved. There should soon be an Increase in the number of men for our coast defenses; these men should be of the right type and properly trained; and there should therefore be an Increase of pay for certain skilled grades, especially in the coast artillery. Money should be appropriated to permit troops to be massed in body and exercised in ma neuvers, particularly In marching. Such exercise during the summer just past has been of Incalculable benefit to the army and should un dcr no circumstances be discontin ued. If on these practice marches nnd In these maneuvers elderly offi cers prove unable to bear the strain, ""v Riiuiiiu oe retired at once, ror he fact Is conclusive as to their un fitness for war; that is, for the only purpose because of which they should be allowed to stay in the service. It Is a real misfortune to have scoreB of small company or regimental posts scattered throughout "the coun try; the army should be gathered in a few brigade or division posts; and the generals should be practiced In handling the men in masses. Neg lect to preside for all of this means to incur the risk of future disaster and disgrace. The readiness and efficiency of both the army and navy in dealing with the recent sudden crisis ,ln Cu ba illustrate afresh their value to the nation. This readiness and ef ficiency would have been very much less had it not been for the exist ence of the general staff In the army and the general board In the navy; both are essential to the proper de velopment and use of our military forces afloat and ashore. The troops that were sent to Cuba were handled flawlessly. It was the swiftest mo bilization and dispatch of troops over sea ever accomplished by our gov ernment. The expedition landed completely equipped and ready for Immediate service, several of Its or ganizations hardly remaining in Ha vana over nght before spitting up into dciacments and going to their several posts. It was a fine demon stration of the value and efficiency of the general staff. Similarly, it was owing in large part to the gen eral board that the navy was able at the outset to meet the Cuban cri sis with such instant efficiency; ship after ship appearing on the shortest notice at any threatened point, while the marine corps in particular per formed indispensable service. The army and navy war colleges are of incalcuable value to the two services, and they cooperate with constantly increasing efficiency and importance. The congress has most wisely pro vided for a national board for the promotion of ritle practise. Excel lent results have already come from this law, but It does not go far enough. Our .regular army is so small that in any great war we should have to trust mainly to vol unteers; and in such event these vol unteers should already know how to shoot; for if a soldier has the fight ing edge, and ability to take care of himself in .the open, his efficiency on the line of battle is almost directly proportionate to excellence in mark manship. We should establish shoot ing galleries In all the large public and military schools, should main tain national target ranges in dif erent parts of the country, nnd should in every way encourage the formation of rifle clubs throughout all parts of the land. The little re public of Switzerland offers us an ex ample In all matters connected with building up an efficent citizen snidery.

SAX KKAXCISCO TKAIN DELAYED Through the derailment of the front part of the engine attached to the through San Francisco train it did not arrive until about 1:30 on Tuesday morning. The accident oc curred near Tonopah Junction and was caused apparently by the heavy snow clogging the frog plates. The engine .after leaving the rails, plowed its nose into a ditch before it wai brought to a halt. After hard work matters were finally ad justed and the train proceeded.
