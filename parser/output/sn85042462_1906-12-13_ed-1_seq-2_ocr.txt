2 RAYNER TALKS ON JAPANESE CRITICISES ROOSEVELT AND HIS MESSAGE •ays Treaty with Japan, If It Applies to Case, le Unconstitutional. Asks If President Is to Become a Dictator By As«ocl*.t*d Press. | WASHINGTON, Dm, 12 Much Inter* •■« it«n tnnnirrntrrt In thr senate In the position defended l>r Senator llninrr !■ his dlecuaaloa today of the Japnneae aneatloa. lie contended that the Inherent right* of ■ state coald not be violated hi treaty any more than they could be violated by concreas. To support thU he , cited many adjudicated cam by the Supreme court and arrayed lonic linen of eminent antborltlea. I Rayner alao save the caaen and an thorltlea of the other aide to the propo sition. He wan Interrupted many time* la his conatltntlonal argument by xena )ora who wlahed to bring out apeclflc points. Senator Rayner apoke for more than am hour. 

WASHINGTON. Dec. 12. — Caustic criticisms of President Roosevelt's po sition on the Jnpanese question pref aced Senator Rayner's discussion In th« senate of the constitutional ques tions Involved. If the military and civil forces of the federal government were to be used by the president, Mr. Rayner said. It became very important to know the «xact power of the president in the matter. ' Because," he added, "It is quite a serious matter, In view of the great calamity that has lately befallen the city of San Francisco, for the president to contemplate the bombard &i«; of the city at this time, and to de- Qlare war against the board of county school trustees of San Francisco if there Is no justification or pretext upon which such ferocious proceedings can be undertaken. Roasts Roosevelt . "The president is exercising a great many functions — legislative, executive and Judicial, lawful and unlawful, con stitutional and unconstitutional. ■ "If he Is possessed of the Idea that he is supervisor of all the public schools Of the various states of the nation— and he seems to be impressed with this idea, because in the very last para graph of his message he recommends the establishment of shooting galleries in all of the large public schools of the country— we must either disabuse his mind of this fancy or we must let him know that we agree as to the omnipo tence of his jurisdiction. Could Admit Negroes "If he can take possession of the pub lic schools of California and compel the state to admit to them Japanese students contrary to the laws of Cali fornia, he could with equal propriety send us an amendment to the Santo Domingo treaty and demand the ad mission of the nefro children of Santo Domingo into the white schools of South Carolina or any other state of the Union. • "Of course, if the people have come I to the conclusion that everything that the president recommends is right, then there is hardly any use In contesting any of his propositions, and instead of conferring upon him the power to give congress information of the state of the union we might confer upon him the function of furnishing his own ' peculiar views upon the entire state of | the universe and recommending any improvements or changes in the general plan of creation that he may deem ex pedient, from the crade to the grave. Anticipates Cradle "In fact, the president, upon page 29 of his message, anticipates the cradle and makes a recommendation upon the state of the Union that tends to place in his hands the establishment of the birth rate of the country. Now, if we can only supplement this function by giving him complete jurisdiction over the death rate, we will have a rule on which his übiquity is uncircumscribed and whose unlimited possibilities are beyond the reach of human contempla tion." Mr. Rayner coincided with what the president had said in his message in praise of the Japanese. His sympathies had, he said, been with them during the war with Russia, and he thought It a great shame that Japan should have been overpowered In the conference room when she had been victorious on the battlefield. He proposed, he said, to discuss the present question entirely outside of oMpUTHERN^IIFORNIA W Jtosic(p ;^^ 332-334 So. Broadway, LOS

Mr. Rnyner snld: , "The power of ■ state to regulate lts public school system is clearly among Its reserved powers. Have we, therefore, a right to provide In I treaty that the citizens of foreign lands shall possess privileges In the public schools of the state thai are prohibited either by the constitution or the laws of the state In which they are claimed? If we can, in defiance of the laws and consti tution of a state, Incorporate any such provision In a treaty such an to bind the state, then we can undoubtedly de prive the state of every reserved right that it possesses and rescind and annul lts laws and its constitution when It comes In conflict with the treaty mak ing power.

CHICAGO, Dec. 12.— The story of a man who has traveled half around the world and most of the distance on foot to escape the wiles of a woman who, he asserts, has matrimonial as pirations in which he figures as the prospective husband, was unfolded to a reporter yesterday. The tale in which a flight first to Germany and back to this country again was Included was related by John Novatne, half owner of a gold mine near Prescott, Ariz. Met Her in Paris "I was in a cafe In Paris one night," he said yesterday, "\ijhen I made the acquaintance of a young woman— a widow — who at once fell desperately in I love with me. I returned the affec [ tion at tho time, but soon I grew sus picious when she asked so many per sonal questions. "She wanted to know the value of my mine and she wanted to know how much money I was worth. Then she suddenly proposed marriage. I was surprised at the offer, but she Insisted. 'I will marry you whether you like it or not.' she said, but I decided right there there would be no marriage, so I left."
