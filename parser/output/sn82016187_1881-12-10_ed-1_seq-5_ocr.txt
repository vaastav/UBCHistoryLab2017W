THE NATIONAL TRIBUNE: WAiSfflNGTON, D. C, DECEMBER 10, 1881. THE PRESIDENT MESSAGE. To the Senate and House of BeprcsenMives ojthe United States : An appalling calamity has befallen the Ameri can people since their chosen representatives last jaet in the halls where you are now assembled. We might else recall with unalloyed content the rare prosperity with which throughout the year the Nation has been blessed. Its harvests have been plenteous ; its varied industries have thriven; the health of its people has been preserved ; it has maintained with foreign governments the undis turbed relations of amity and peace. For these manifestations of His favor, we owe to Him who -holds our destiny in His hands the tribute of our grateful devotion. To that mysterious exercise of His will, which has taken from us the loved and illustrious citi zen who was but lately the head of the Nation, we bow in sorrow and submission. The memory of his exalted character, of his noble achievements, and of his patriotic life will be treasured forever as a sacred possession of the whole people. The announcement of his death drew from for eign governments and peoples tributes of sympa thy and sorrow "which history will record as sig t. nal tokens of the kinship of nations and the fed eration of mankind. 

MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS. Reference is next made to the good feeling exist ing between the United States and Great Britain, settlement of the Fortune Bay fisheries claims, sur render of Sitting Bull, the Yorktown celebration, Bi-Metallic Monetary Conference, and Electrical Exhibition and Congress held in Paris ; also to the pending negotiations for an International Copy right convention. The relations existingbetween the United States , and Spain, Germany, Russia, Italy, Holland, and Turkey are next touched upon briefly, the mes sage stating that a correspondence is being con ducted with the latter country with a view to securing better protection to American citizens resident therein. Switzerland has been requested to take steps to prevent the emigration of criminals under the laws of that country to our shores, and the mes sage further states that treaties of commerce and navigation have been entered into between Rou mania and Servia. Mexico and the Central America States are re ferred to briefly and a recommendation is made . that our Government take proper steps to prevent lawlessness on the frontier of the former. THE 

ISTHMUS CANAX. The President in his message, referring to the Isthmus canal, says : The questions growing out of the proposed inter-oceanic water-way across the Isthmus of Pan ama are of grave national importance. This Gov ernment has not been unmindful of the solemn obligations imposed upon it by its compact of 1840 with Colombia, as the independent and sov ereign mistress of the territory crossed bv the ca- nal, and has sought to render them effective by fresh engagements with the Colombian Republic looking to their practical execution. The nego tiations to this end, after they had reached what appeared to be a mutually satisfactory solution here, were met in Colombia by a disavowal of the powers which its envoy had assumed, and by a proposal for renewed negotiation on a modified basis. Meanwhile this Government learned that Co lombia had proposed to the European powers to join in a guaiantee of the neutrality of the pro posed Panama canal a guarantee which would be in direct contravention of our obligation as the sole guarantor of the integrity of Colombian ter ritory and of the neutrality of the canal itself. Ify lamented predecessor felt it his duty to place before the European powers the reasons which make the prior guarantee of the United States indispensable, and for which the interjection of any foreign guarantee might be regarded as a superfluous and unfriendly act. Foreseeing the probable reliance of the British government on the provisions of the Clayton Bulwer Treaty of 1850, as affording room for a share in the guarantees which the United States s covenanted with Colombia four years before, I have not hesitated to supj lement the action of my predecessor by proposing to Her Majesty's gov ernment the modification of that instrument and the abrogation of such clauses thereof as do not comport with the obligations of the United States toward Colombia, or with the vital needs of the two friendly parties to the compact. 

CHILI AND PERU. This Government sees with great concern the continuence of the hostile relations between Chili, Bolivia, and Peru. An early peace between these republics is much to be desired, not only that they may themselves be spared further , misery and bloodshed, hut because their continued antagonism threatens consequences which are, in my judgment, dangerous to the interests of re publican government on this continent, and cal culated to destroy the best elements of our free and peaceful civilization. As in the present excited condition of popular feeling in these countries here has been serious misapprehension of the position of the United States, and as separate diplomatic intercourse with each through independent ministers is some times subject, owing to the want of prompt re ciprocal communication, to temporary misunder standing, I have deemed it judicious, at the pres ent time, to send a special envoy, accredited to all and each of them, and furnished with general instructions, which will, I trust, enable, him to bring these powers into friendly relations. 

OTHER FOREIGN STATES. Continuing, the message refers to the friendly relations existingbetween our own and the Vene zuelan Government and its prompt payment of the monthly quotas of the diplomatic debt, and deplores the withdrawal of the American lines of communication between our own ports and those of Brazil. In speaking of China and Japan, the President recommends that the balance of the indemnity fund paid by those governments now remaining in the State Department be repaid to them. Some suggestions of minor importance arealss made regarding the consular service, especially in Japan. The relations existing between the United States and Hawaii, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, Hayti, Paraguay, and Uruguay, Por tugal, Sweeden and Norway, Greece and Ecqua- dor are declare friendly, and a recommendation is made to restore the missions to the two coun tries last named. 

VARIOUS SUBJECTS. The message refers favorably to the Geneva Convention for the relief of the wounded in war, invites attention to the propriety of adopting the new Code of International Rules for the preven tion of collisions on the high seas, and to the State Department reports of trade and manufac tures abroad. Also to the operations of the In ternational Sanitary Conference, and the National Board of Health, to provide against the spread of contagious diseases. THE FINANCES. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury presents in detail a highly satisfactory exhibit of the state of the finances and the condition of the various brandies of the public service adminis tered by that Department. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 00, 1881, were: 198,159,676 02 135,264,385 51 2,201,863 17 8,116,115 72 810,833 80 805,180 54 1,225,514 86 2,244,983 98 262,174 00 3,468,485 61 2,016,199 23 6,206v880 13 I From sinking fund for Pacific' Railway vyvuiiyiuueS - "from cubtoms fees, fines, penalties, &c... i'Him fees consular, letters-patent, and Itds Fronv proceeds of sales of government property From profits on coinage From revenues of Vhj District of Colum bia From miscellaneous sources Total ordinary receipts 360,782,292 57 The ordinary expenses for the same period were : Forcivil expenses 17,941,177 19 For foreign intercourse.

The sum of $74,480,201.05 was applied to this fund, which left a deficit of $16,305,873.47. The increase of the revenues for 1881 over those of the previous year was 29,352,901.10. It is estimated that the receipts during the present fiscal year will reach $400,000,000, and the expenditures 270,000,000, leaving a surplus of $130,000,000 applicable to the sinking fund and the redemption of the public debt. I approve the recommendation of the Secre tary of the Treasury, that provision be made for the early retirement of silver certificates, and that the act requiring their issue be repealed. The President, next, after referring to the coinage, and advising the passage of a law pro hibiting national banks retiring their circula tion except upon seasonable notice, goes on to say: J The revenue from customs for the past fiscal year was $198,159,076.02, an increase of $11,637, 611.42 over that of the year preceding. $133, 098,562.39 of this amount was collected at the port of New York, leaving $50,251,113.63 as the amount collected at all the other ports of the country. Of this sum, S47,977.137.63 was collected on sugar, melado and molasses; $27,285,624.78 on wool and its manufactures ; $21,462,234.34 on iron and steel, and manufactures thereof; $19,038,665. 81 on manufactures of silk; $10,825,115.21 on manufactures of cotton : and $6,469,643.04 on wines and spirits; making a total revenue from .these sources of $133,058,720.81. The expenses of collection for the past year were $6,419,345.20, an increase over the preceding year of $387,410.04. Notwithstanding the increase in the revenue from customs over the preceding year, the gross value of imports, including free goods, decreased over twenty-five millions of dollars. The most marked decrease was in the value of unmanufactured wool. $14,023,682, and in that of scrap and pig iron. $12,810,671. The value of imported sugar, on the other hand, showed an increase of $7,457,474 ; of steel rails, $4,345,521; of barley, $2,154,204; and of steel in bars, ingots, &c., $1,620,046. Contrasted with the imports during the last fiscal year, the exports were as follows : Domestic merchandise SSS3,925,947 Foreign merchandise 18,151,399 Total 902,377,316 Imports of merchandise 642,601,628 Excess of exports over imports of merchan dise 259,712,718 Aggregate of exports and imports 1,545,041,974 Compared with the previous years there was an increase of $66,738,638 in the value of exports of merchandise, and a decrease of $25,290,118 in the value of imports. The annual average of the excess of imports of merchandise over ex ports thereof for ten years previous to June 30, 1873, was $104,706,922 : but for the last six years there has been an excess of exports over imports of meichandise amounting to $1,180,6G8,105, an annual average of $196,778,017. The specie value of the exports of domestic merchandise was $376,616,473 in 1870 and $883,925,947 in 1881, an increase of $507,309,474, or 135 per cent. The value of imports was $435,953,408 in 1870 and $642,664,623 in 1831, an increase of $200, 706,220, or 47 per cent. During each year from 1862 to 1879, inclusive, the exports of specie exceeded the imports. The largest excess of such exports over imports was reached during the year 1864, when it amounted to $92,280,929 : but during the year ended June 30, 1880, the imports of coin and bullion ex ceeded the exports by $75,891,391, and during the last fiscal year the excess of imports over exports was $91,168,650. In the last annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury the attention of Congress was called to the fact that $469,651,050 in five per centum bonds and $203,573,750 in six per centum bonds would become redeemable during the year, and Congress was asked to authorize the refunding of these bonds at a lower rate of interest. The bill for such refunding having failed to become a law, the Secretary of the Treasury, in April last, notified the holders of the $195,690,400 six per centum bonds then outstanding, that the bonds would be paid at par on the first day of July following, or that they might be "con tinued '' at the pleasure of the Government, to bear interest at the rate of three and one-half per centum per annum. Under this notice $178,055,150 of the six per centum bonds were continued at the lower rate, and $17,635,250 were redeemed. In the month of May, a like notice was given respecting the redemption or continuance of the $439,841,350 of five per centum bonds then out standing, and of these, $401,504,900 were con tinued at three and one-half per centum per an num, and $39,336,450 redeemed. The six per centum bonds of the loan of Feb ruary 8, 1861, and of the Oregon war debt, amount ing together to $U,125,S00, having matured dur ing the year, the Secretary of the Treasury gave notice of his intention to redeem the same, and such as have been presented have been paid from the surplus revemus. There have also been re deemed at par $16.1 79,1 00 of the three and one half per centum ''continued" bonds, making a total of bonds redeemed, or which have ceased to bear interest during the year, of $123,909,650.

Unless these bonds can be fended at a much lower rate of interest than they now bear, I agree with the Secretary of the Treasury that no legis lation respecting them is desinble. 

TAXATION. Regarding this question, the President says: It is a matter for congratulation that the busi ness of the country has been s prosperous during the past year as to yield, ty taxation, a large surplus of income to the Gvernment. If the revenue laws remain unchaiged this surplus must, year by year, increase, on account of the reduction of the public debt and its burden of interest, and because of the rigid increase of our population. In 1860, just prir "to the institution of our internal revenue system, our population but slightly exceeded 30,000,100; by the census of 1880 it is now found to exceed 50,000,000. It is estimated that even if the.mnual receipts and expenditures should continue as at present, the entire debt could be paid in fen years. In view, however, of the heivy load of taxation which our people have alrerdy borne, we may well consider whether it is no:-the part of wisdom to reduce the revenues, even if we delay a little the payment of the debt. It seems to me that the tine has arrived when the people may justly demand some relief from their present onerous burden, and that by due economy in the vaiious braiches of the public service, this may readily be dforded. I therefore concur with the Secretary in recom mending the abolition of a'l Internal Revenue taxes, except those upon tobacco in its various forms, and upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors ; and except, also, tie special tax upon the manufacturers of, and dedcrs in such articles. The retention of the latter tax is desirable as affording the officers of the Government a proper supervision of these articles for the prevention of fraud. I agree with the Secretary of the Treasury, that the law imposing a stamp tax upon matches, proprietary articles, playing cards, checks, and drafts, may, with propriety, be repealed, and the law, also, by which banks and bankers are assessed upon their capital and deposits. There seems to be a general sentiment in favor of this course. In the present condition of our revenues the tax upon deposits is especially unjust. It was never imposed in this country until it was demanded by the necessities of war, and was never exacted, I believe, in any other country, even in its great est exigencies. " The retention of this tax has been suggested as a means of reimbursing the Government for the expense of printing and furnishing the circu lating notes. If the tax sliould be repealed it would certainly seem proper to require the national banks to pay the amount of such ex pense to the Comptroller of the Currency. It is perhaps doubtful whether the immediate reduction of the rate of taxation upon liquors and tobacco is advisable, especially in view of the drain upon the Treasury which must attend the payment of arrears of pensions. A com parison, however, of the amount of taxes col lected under the varying rates of taxation which have at different times prevailed suggests the intimation that some reduction may soon be made without material diminution of the revenue. The tariff laws also need revision ; but, that a due regard may be "paid to the conflicting in terests of our citizens, important changes should be made with caution. If a careful revision cannot be made at this session, a commission such as was lately approved by the Senate and is now recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury would doubtless lighten the labors of Congress whenever this subject shall be brought to its consideration. 

ARMY AND NAVY. The President concurs in the recommendation of the Secretary of War for increasing the army to 30,000 enlisted men, suggests the need of legis lation to prevent intrusion upon lands set apart for the Indians, and advises more adequate ap propriations for casual support of Indians whose appropriations have become exhausted, in order to relieve the War Department from contributing thereto. An increase of the strength of the engineer battalion of the army is also recommended. Speaking of the report of the Secretary of the Navy, the President says : I cannot too strongly urge upon you my con viction that every consideration of national safety, economy, and honor imperatively demands a thorough rehabilitation of our Navy. N ltn a lull appreciation of the fact that com pliance with the suggestions of the head of that Department and of the Advisory Board must involve a large expenditure of the public moneys, I earnestly recommend such appropriations as will accomplish an end which seems to me so desirable. Nothing can be more inconsistent with true public economy than withholding the means necessary to accomplish the objects intrusted by the Constitution to the national legislature. One of those objects, and one which is of paramount importance, is declared by our fundumental law to be the provision for the "common defense." Surely nothing is more essential to the defense of the United States and of all our people than the efficiency of our Navy. We have for many year3 maintained with foreign governments the relations of honorable peace, and that such relations may be permanent is desired by every patriotic citizen of the Re public. But if we heed the teachings of history, we shall not forget that in the life of every nation emergencies may arise when a resort to arms can alone save it from dishonor. No danger from abroad now threatens this people, nor have we any cause to distrust the friendly professions of other governments. But for avoiding as well as for repelling dangers that may threaten us in the future, we must be prepared to enforce any policy which we think wise to adopt. We must be ready to defend our harbors against aggression, to protect, by the distribution of our ships of war over the highways of commerce, the varied interests of our foreign trade, and the pei-sons and property of our citizens abroad, to maintain everywhere the honor of our flag, and the distinguished position which Ave may right fully claim among the nations of the world. 

POSTAL MATTERS. After reference to the growth of the postal service of the United States, and recommending a modification of fees for money orders, making the limit $100 instead of $50, and reducing the fees from ten to five cents for sums not over $5 ; also recommending a system of posta.1 savings depositories, and suggesting legislation to provide for the disposition of unclaimed money orders now amounting to over $1,000,000, the President says : Great reductions have recently been made in the expense of the star-route service. The in vestigations of the Department of Justice and the Post-Office Department have resulted in the presentation of indictments against persons formerly connected with that service, accusing them of offenses against the United States. I have enjoined upon the officials who are charged with the conduct of the cases on the part of the Government and upon the eminent counsel who, before my accession to the Presidency, were called to their assistance, the duty of prosecuting with the utmost vigor of the law all persons who may be found chargeable with frauds upon the postal service. THE 

JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Referring to the report of the Acting Attorney General, the President calls attention to the need of further legislation to secure a better and more expeditious execution of the Federal laws, and suggests the importance of the speedy adop tion of such measures as will grant relief to the overburdened courts, including the Supreme Court. The disorders in Arizona and on the Mexican border are also referred to, with the suggestion that proper legislation be had to sup press them. THE 

INDIANS. Touching this matter the President says : First. I recommend the passage of an act making the laws of the various States and Ter ritories applicable to the Indian reservations within their borders, and extending the laws of the State of Arkansas to the portion of the In dian Territory not occupied by the five civilized tribes. The Indian should receive the protection of the law. He should be allowed to maintain in court his rights of person and property. He has repeatedly begged for this privilege. Its exercise would be very valuable to him in his progress toward civilization. Second. Of even greater importance is a measure which has been frequently recommended by my predecessors in office, and in furtherance of which several bills have been from time to time introduced in both houses of Congress. The enactment of a general law permitting the allotment in severalty, to such Indians, at least, as desire it, of a reasonable quantity of land secured to them by patent, and for their own protection made inalienable for twenty or twenty five years, is demanded for their present welfare and their permanent advancement. In return for such considerate action on the part of the Government, there is reason to believe that the Indians in large numbers would be persuaded to sever their tribal relations and to engage at once in agricultural pursuits. Many of them realize the fact that their hunting days are over, and that it is now for their best interests to conform their manner of life to the new order of things. By no greater in ducement than the assurance of permanent title to the soil can they be led to engage in the occupation of tilling it. The well-attested reports of their increasing in terest in husbandry justify the hope and belief that the enactment of such a statute as I recommend would be at once attended with gratifying results. A resort to the allotment system would have a di rect and powerful influence in dissolving the tribal bond, which is so prominent a feature of savage life, and which tends so strongly to perpetuate it. Third. I advise a liberal appropriation for the support of Indian .schools, because of my confident belief that such a course is consistent with the wis est economy. Even among the most uncultivated Indian tribes there is reported to be a general and urgent desire on the part of the chiefs and older members for the education of their children. It is unfortunate, in view of this fact, that during the past year the means which have been at the command of the Interior Department for the purpose of Indian instruction have proved to be utterly inadequate. The success of the schools which are in operation at Hamilton, Carlisle, and Forest Grove should not only encour age a more generous provision for the support of those institutions, but should prompt the establish ment of others of a similar character. They are doubtless much more potent for good than the day schools upon the reservation, as the pupils are altogether separated from the surround ings of savage life, and brought into constant con tact with civilization. THE 

MORMONS. Regarding the'question of polygamy in the Terri tories the President expresses himself as follows: For many years the Executive, in his annual mes sage to Congress, has urged the necessity of string ent legislation for the suppression of polygamy in the Territories, and especially in the Territory of Utah. The existing statute for the punishment of this odious crime, so revolting to the moral and re ligious sense of Christendom, has been persistently and contemptuously violated eversince its enactment. Indeed, in spite of commendable efforts on the part of the authorities who represent the United States in that Territory, the law has in very rare instances been enforced, and, for a cause to which reference will presently be made, is practically a dead letter. The fact that adherents of the Mormon Church, which rests upon polygamy as its corner-stone, have recently been peopling in large numbers Idaho. Ari zona, and other of our Western Territories, is well cal culated to excite the liveliest interest and apprehen sion. It imposes upon Congress and the Executive the duty of arraying against this barbarous system all the power which, under the Constitution and the law, they can wield for its destruction. Reference has been already made to the obstacles which the United States ollicers have encountered in their efforts to punish violations of law. Promi nent among these obstacles is the difficulty of pro curing legal evidence sufficient to warrant a convic tion even in the case of the most notorious offender. Your attention is called to a recent opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, explaining its judgment of reversal in the case of Miles, who had been convicted of bigamy in Utah. The court re fers to the fact that the secrecy attending the cele bration of marriages in that Territory makes the proof of polygamy very difficult; and the propriety is suggested of modifying the law of evidence which J makes a wife incompetent to testify against her husband. This suggestion is approved, the passage of an act providing I recommend also that in the Territo- ries of the United States the fact that a woman has been married to a person charged with bigamy shall not disqualify her as a witness upon his trial for that offense. I further recommend legistation by which any person solemnizing a marriage in any of the Territories shall be required, under stringent penalties for neglect or refusal, to file a certificate of such marriage in the Supreme Court of the Ter ritory. Doubtless Congress may devise other practicable measures for obviating the difficulties which have hitherto attended the efforts to suppress this ini quity. I assure you of my determined purpose to co operate with you in any lawful and discreet meas ures which may be proposed to that end. 

AGRICULTURE AND PURLIC LANDS. The message commends to the careful attention of Congress the suggestions of the Commissioner of Agriculture touching the enlargement of his De partment, and suggests the propriety of donating portions of the public domain for educational pur poses, the allotment to be made upon the basis of illiteracy, to the several States. PENSIONS. Upon this subject the President says: It appears from the report of the Commissioner of Pensions that, since lo60, 760,063 original pension claims have been filed ; 450,919 of these have been al lowed and inscribed on the pension-roll: 72,539 have been rejected and abandoned, being 13 X per cent, of the whole number of claims settled. There are now pending for settlement -205,010 oiioiual pensions cluiiuM, 2r,040 of which were filed prior to July 1. lSO. These, when allowed, will involvo the payment of arrears from the date of discharge in case of an invalid, and from date of death or termination of a prior right in all other cases. From all the data obtainable it is estimated that 15 per cent, of the number of claims now pending will be rejected or abandoned. This would show the probable rejection of I 1,0 10 eases, and the prolv able admission of about 193,000 claims,' all of which involve the payment of arrears of pension. With the present force employed, the number of adjudications remaining the same and no new busi ness intervening, this number of claims (193,000) could be acted upon in a period of six years ; and taking January 1, 1884,RsanearperiodfromtThichto estimate in each case an average amount of arrears, it is found that every case allowed would require,, for the first payment upon it, the sum of $1,350. Multiplying this amount by the whole number or probable admissions givo $250,000,000 as the sum re quired for first payments. This represents the sum which must be paid upon claims which were filed before July J, 1880, and are now pending, and en titled to the benefits of the arrears act. From this amount ($250,000,000) may be deducted from ten to fifteen millions, for cases where, the claimant dying-, there is no person who, under the law, would be en titled to succeed to the pension, leaving $235,000,000 as the probable amount to be paid. In these estimates, no account has been taken of the 38,500 cases filed since June 30, 18S0, and now pending, which must receive attention as current business, but which do not involve the payment of any arrears beyond the date of filing the claim. Of this number it is estimated that SO per cent, will be allowed. As has been stated, with the present force of th Pension Bureau, 675 clerks, it is estimated that it will take six years to dispose of the claims now pending. It is stated by the Commissioner of Pensions that by an addition of 250 clerks (increasing the adjudi cating force rather than the mechanical) double the amount of work could be accomplished, so that these cases could be acted upon within three years. Aside from the considerations of justice which may be urged for a speedy settlement of the claims now on the files of the Pension Office, it is no less important on the score of economy, inasmuch as fully one-third of the clerical force of the office is now wholly occupied in giving attention to corres pondence with the thousands of claimants whose cases have been on the files for the past eighteen years. The fact that a sum so enormous must bo expended by the Government to meet demands for arrears of pensions, is an admonition to Congress and the Executive to give cautious consideration to any similar project in the future. The great tempta tion to the presentation of fictitious claims afford ed by the fact that the average sum obtained upon; each application is $1,300, leai me to suggest th propriety of making some speeral appropriation for the prevention of fraud. THE 

CIVIL SERVICE. Speaking of the Civil Service of the Government the President remarks : In my letter accepting the nomination for the Vice-Presidency, I stated that in my judgment "no man should be the incumbent of an office the duties of which he is for any cause unfit to per form who is lacking in ability, fidelity or integ rity which a proper administration of such office demands.-' This sentiment would doubtless meet with general acquiescence, but opinion has been, widely divided upon the wisdom and practicability of the various reformatory schemes which have beerr suggested, and of certain proposed regulations gov erning appointments to public office. "The efficiency of such regulations has been dis trusted, mainly because they have seemed to exalt mere educational and abstract tests above general business capacity, and even special fitness for th particular work in hand. It seemes to me that the rules which should be applied to the management of the public service, may properly conform in th& main to such as regulate the conduct of successful private business : "Original appointments should bo based upon as certained fitness. "The tenure of office should be stable. " Positions of responsibility should, so far as prac ticable, be filled by the promotion of worthy and efficient officers. "The investigation of all complaints, and the punishment of all official misconduct should b prompt and thorough." The views expressed in the foregoing letter are those which will govern my administration of the Executive Office. They are doubtless shared by all intelligent and patriotic citizens, however divergent in their opinions as to the best methods of putting; them into practical operation. OUR 

2IERCHANT MARINE. The continuing decline of the merchant marine -of the United States is greatly to be deplored. In view of the fact that we furnish so large a propor tion of the freights of the commercial world, and1 that our shipments are steadily and rapidly increas ing, it is cause of surprise that not only is our navi gation interests diminishing, but it is less than when our exports and imports were not half so large as now. either in bulk or value. There must be somt peculiar hinderunce to the development of this in terest, or the enterprise and energy of American mechanics and capitalists would have kept this' country at least abreast of our rivals in the friendly contest for ocean supremacy. The substitution or iron for wood, and of steam for sail have wrough t great revolutions in the carrying trade of the world ; but these changes could not have been adverse to Amer ica if we had given to our navigation interests a portion of the aid and protection which have been so widely bestowed upon our manufactures. I com mend the whole subject to the wisdom of Congress. CONCLUDING RECOMMENDATIONS. In concluding his message the President com mends to the consideration of Congress the question: of additional legislation in regard to emigrant tax, and concerning a library building for Congress, the improvement of the Potomac river at the capital, a, government for Alaska, removal of the steam rail ways from the streets of Washington, and various other matters of local interest. THE 

PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE. The importance of timely legislation with respect to the ascertainment and declaration of the vote for Presidential electors was sharply called to the at tention of the people more than four years ago. It is to be hoped that some well-defined measure may be devised before another national election,, which will render unnecessary a resort to any ex pedient of a temporary character, for the detemii-m'-tion of questions upon contested returns. Questions which concern the very existence of the Governmcnta nd the liberties of the people were suggested by the prolonged illness of the late Pres ident, and his consequent incapacity to perform the functions of his office. It is provided by the second article of the Consti tution, in the fifth clause of its first section, that "in case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge- the powers and duties of said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice-President." What is the intendment of the Constitution in itSs -specification of ''inability to discharge the powers - and duties of said office," is one of the contingen-.-cies which calls the Vice-President to the exercise of Presidential functions? Is the inability limited in its nature to-long-continued intellectual incapacity, or has it a broader. -import? What must be its extenf and duration? How must its existence be established? Has the President, whose inability is the subject of inquiry, any voice in determining whether ornot it exists, or is the decision of that momentous and delicate question confided to the Vice-President, or is it contemplated by the Constitution that Congress should provide bylaw precisely what sliould consti tute inability, and how and by what tribunal or aitr thority it should be ascertained. If the inability proves to be temporary in its nat ure, and during its continuance the Vice-President lawfully exercises the functions of the Executive, by what tenure does he hold bis office? Does lie continue as President for the remainder of the four years' term ? Or would the elected President, if his inability should cease in the interval, be enijiowered to re- -same his office? And if having such lawful authority he sliould exercise it, would the Vice-President be thereupon empowered to resume his powers and duties as such ? 1 cannot doubt that these important questions will receive your early and though tail consideration. Deeply impressed with the gravity of the respon sibilities which have so unexpectedly devolved upoa me, it will be my constant purpose to co-operate with you in such measures as will promote the glory -of the counrtv and tho prosperitv of its people.
