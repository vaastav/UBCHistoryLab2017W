The president's message was laid be fore congress about 2 o'clock. It reads as follows: . THE 

MESSAGE. To the Congress of the United States: The constitutional duties which require the president from time to time to give to the bongress information of the state of the Union and recommend to its con sideration such measures as he shall find necessary and expedient, is fittingly en tered upon by transmitting to congress a careful examination of the detailed state ments and well supported recommenda tions contained in the reports of the heads of departments, who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the government. Onr Foreign Relation). While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been en tirely free from perplexities, no embar rassing situation remains that will not give the spirit of fairness and form of justice which joined with consistent firm ness characterize a truly American for eign policy. Domestio hostilities in the republic of Brazil found the U. S. alert to watch the interests of our citizens in that country with which we oarry on important .com meroe. I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim recogni tion as belligerents in passing our fixed policy of impartial neutrality in soon a condition of affairs as now exist. I deem it neoessary to disavow iu a manner not to be misunderstood the unauthorized action of our late naval commander in those waters in saluting the revolutionary Brazilian admiral. The convention between our govern ment and Chili, having for its object the settlement and adjustment of the de mands of the two countries against each uther,",hns been made effective by the organization of the claims commission. Tbe good offices of the presidont of the Swiss republic were invoked as pro vided in the treaty and this consent of the Swiss representative to complete its or ganization was gratifying alike to the United States and Chili. Vexatious questions have grown out of the un authorized aotion ef the late United States minister in reoeiving in his official resi dence two persons who had just failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges were pending out of a former disturbance. Under no circumstances can the repre sentatives of this government be permit ted under the ill defined notion of extra territorial jurisdiction to interrupt the administration of criminal justice in the country to which they are accredited. Referring to the Chinese question, the president says that he believes that the recent extension of time in whioh the Chi nese may register will obviate in a great degree the neoessity of enf oroing deporta tion. The president reoommends reciprocal criminal extradition treaties with Costa Bioa, Columbia and other oountries not now sustaining these relations. Our rela tions with France and Gemany are entire ly satisfactory and the president hopes that the extradition treaty with the former oountry as amended by the senate will soon be in operation. OThe questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations are in progress between the two govern ments with a view to such concurrent ao tion as will make the award arid regula tions agreed upon by the Behiihg sea tribunal of arbitration praotioally effec tive, and it is not doubted that Great Britain will oo-operate freely with this country for the accomplishment of that purpose. Oar " Relations with Mexico. ' eontinue to be of that close and friendly nature which should always characterize the interecourse of two neighboring re

The work of relocating the monuments marking the boundary be tween these countries from Paso del Norte to the Pacific is nearly completed. The commission recently organized un der the conventions of 1884 and 1889, it is expected, will speedily settle the disputes growing out of the shifting currents of the Rio Grande river south of El Paso. The extradition treaty with Norway has recently been exchanged and proclaimed. The extradition treaty with Russia, signed in March, 1887, and amended and con firmed by the senate in February last, was dnly proclaimed last June. Speaking of the Samoan troubles, the president says that they serve to signally illustrate the impolicy of entangling alliances with foreign powers. Important matters have demanded at tention in our relations with the Ottoman Porte. The firing and partial destruction by an unrestrained mob of one of the school buildings of Anatolia college es tablished by the citizens of the United Slates at Marsovan and the apparent in difference of the Turkish government to the outrage, notwithstanding the com plicity of Borne of its officers, called for earnest action whioh was followed by promises of reparation v'.nd punishment of the offenders. Indemnity, for the injury to the building has already been paid and promises to rebuild have been given. Information received of maltreatment suffered by inoffensive American women engaged in missionary work on Turkish territory was followed by such represen tations to the Forte as resulted in the issuance of orders for the punishment of their assailants, the removal of a derelict official and the adoption of measures for the protection of our citizens engaged in missionary and other lawful work in that quarter. ., Hawaiian A flairs. It is hardly necessary for me to speak of the questions arising from our rela tions with Hawaii, and which caused serious embarrassments just prior to the installation of the present administration. The existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated between the provisional government of tho islands and submitted to the senate for ratifica tion. This treaty I withdrew for exami nation and dispatched Hon. James A. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commissioner to make an im partial investigation of the circumstances attending the change in the govern ment and of all the conditions bearing npon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination Mr. Blount submitted to me his report showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been . subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government and through intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States which was landed for that purpose at the in stance of our minister. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable oourse for onr government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representatives of the United States and to restore ns far as practicable the status existing at the time of our intervention. With a view of accomplishing this re sult within the constitutional limits of power, and recognizing all obligations And responsibility growing out of any change of condition brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has reoeived appropriate instruc tions. ' Thus far no information of the accomplishment of any definite results have been received from him. Additional advices are soon expected. When re ceived they will promptly be sent to con gross together with all other information at hand accompanied by a special execu tive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to a complete understanding of the case and presenting all the mate rial events leading up to the present situation. International Arbitration. Referring to the concurrent resolution passed by congress in 1890, looking to the arbitration of any differences or disputes between the Republics of Amer ica and European powers, the president says that he is gratified at the progress being made in this direction, Great Britain having already signified her sym pathy with the movement. Government Finances. . The secretary of the treasury reports that the amount of gold exported was larger than any previous year in the his tory of the government, amounting to $108,680,811 and exceeding the amount exported during the preceediug year by $58,485,517. '" It is estimated upon tho basis of tho present revenue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June 30, 1894, will be $430,121,805.38 and its expenditures $458,121,365.88, rosulting in a deficiency of $28,000,000. On the 1st day of November, 1893, the amount of moneys of all kinds in circulation ir not included in the treasury holdings was $1,718,544,682, an increase for the year of $112,404,947. Estimating our population at 67,426,000 at the time mentioned the per capita circulation was $25.49. " On the same date there was in the treasury gold bullion amounting to $96,657,273 and sil ver bullion whioh was purchased at a cost of $126,261,553. The purchase of silver under . the law of July 14, 1890, during the,) last fiscal year, aggregated 64,900,162.59 -fine ounces which cost $45,631,374.53. The total 1 amount of silver purchased from the time that the repeal of its purchasing clause on the first day of November, 1893, was 168,694,590.46 fine ources, its total cost being $155,930,940.84. Between the first day of March, 18 73,. and the first day of November, 1898, the government purchased nnder all laws 503,003,717 fine ounces of silver at a cost of $516,622, 948. The silver dollars, that have been 'ffh Choice Irrigated Lands (Improved and 

SANTA FE, N. coined under the aot of July 14, 1890, number 86,087,285. The seienornge arising from such coin acre was $6,917,008.39, leaving on hand in the mints 140,699,760 ounces of silver, whioh cost $126,758,288. Our total coinage of all metal during the last fisoal year consists of 997,80,875 pieces valned at $43,685,178.80, of which there waf $30,038,140 in gold coin, $5,- 843,715 in silver dollars, $7,217,220.90 in subsidiary silver coin and $1,086,003.90 in minor coin. During the calendar year 1892, the production of precious metal in the United States was estimated to be 1,956,- 875 fine ounces of gold of the coinage value of $30,000,000, and 58,000,000 fine ounces of silver of the bullion or market value of $50,650,000, and of the coinage value of $74,989,900. It is estimated that on the 1st day of July, 1893, the metallio stook of money in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted to $1,218,559,169, of which $597,647,865 was in gold and $615,861,484 was in silver. 'I lie Siational Banks. One hnndred and nineteen national banks were organized during the vear ending October 18, 1893, with a capital of $11,230,000. Forty-six national banks went into voluntary liquidation arid 158 suspended; sixty five of the suspended banks were insolvent, eighty resumed busi ness and seven remain in the hands of bank examiners with prospects of speedy resumption. Of tbe new banks organized forty-lour were located in the eastern states; forty one west of the Mississippi river and thirty-four in the central and southern states. The total number of national banks in existence on the first day of October 1893 was 3,796, having an aggre gate capital of $642,558,120. The net in crease in the circulation of these banks during the year was $36,886,972. Silver Kepeal. The recent repeal of that provision of law requiring tbe purchase of silver bul lion by tbe government asa feature of our monetary scheme has made a change in the complexion of our currency affairs. I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at this time precisely what conditions will be brought about by the change or what if any supplemen tary legislation may in the light of such conditions appear to be essential or ex pedient. Of course, after the recent finan cial perturbation, time is necessary for the re-establishment of business con fidence. When, however, through this restoration of confidence the money which has been frightened into hoarding places is returned to trade and commerce, a survey of the situation will probably dis close a safe path leading to a permanent ly sound currency abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our in creasing population and business. In the pursuit of this object we should resolutely refrain from attempting any temporary expedients, determined to be contented with nothing less than a last ing and comprehensive financial plan, and under these circumstances I am con fident that a reasonable delay in dealing with the subject instead of being in jurious will increase the probability of wise action. The monetary conference ' which asH sembled at Brussels upon our invitation was adjourned to the 80th day of Novem ber in the present year. The considerations just stated and the fact that a definite proposition from the United States seemed to be expeoted upon the reassembling of tbe conference leads me to express a feeling to have the meeting still further postponed, it seems to me that it would be wise to give general authority to the president to invito other nations to such a conference at any time when there should be again prospect of accomplishing an interna tional agreement on the subject of coin age. Government Bonds. I desire also to earnestly suggest the wisdom of amending the existing statutes in regard to the issuance of government bonds. The authority now vested in the secretary of the treasury to issue bonds is not ns clear as it should be and the bonds authorized are disadvantageous to the government both as to the time of their maturity and the rate of interest. The War Department. The secretary of war reports that neither Indian outbreaks or domestio violence have called the army into serv ice during the year and the only active military duty required of it, has been in the department of Texas where viola tion of the neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were promptly and efficiently dealt with by the troops, elioit ing tho warm approval of tho civil and military authorities of both coun tries. Tho influence of civilization and other causes lead to the suggestion that the time is fast approaching when there should be a re-organization of our army on the lines of the present necessities of the country. Coast defenses and forti fications are in a gratifying condition. The Fee Sj stteni. I can not too heartily indorse the pro position of the attorney general that the fee system as applicable to the. compen sation of U. S. attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal courts and U. 8. com missioners should be abolished with as little delay as possible. If in addition to this reform a system were inaugurated which would give the U. S. commissioners the final disposition of petty offences within the grade of misdemeanor, es pecially those coming nnder the Internal revenue laws, a great advance would be made toward a more decent administra tion of the criminal laws.

ACRES ENOUGH unimproved) attractiT.ly platted, for tale M., MONDAY. DECEMBER 4. 1893. $8,000,000 in postal finances for the fiscal year ending June 80, 1894. It was antic ipated that there would be a surplus in oome of at least $8,500,000, but the busi ness depression has had an opposite effect. The president says, that he is of the opinion that the free delivery system should not be further extended than per mitted under the present law. The Navy. The report of the secretary of the navy contains a history of the operations of this department during the past year and exhibits a most gratifying condition of the personnel of our navy. The progress in the construction of vessels has not been as rapid as was anti cipated. There have been delayB in the completion of nnarmored vessels, but for tbe most part they havebeensnchas were constantly occurring even in countries having the largest experience in naval ship building. The difficulties seem now, however, to have been all overcome and armor is being delivered with satisfactory promptness. Pension Matters. The secretary of the interior has- the supervision of so many important sub jects that his report is of especial value and interest. On the 30th day of June, 1893, there were on the pension rolls 966,076 names, an increase of 89,944 over the number on the rolls June 80, 1892. The number of persons remaining on tho rolls under the act of June 29, 1890, whioh allows persons on nccount of death and disability not chargeable to army service, was 459,953. , The number added to tho rolls during the year was 123,634 and the number dropped was 83,690. The first payments on pension allowed during the year amounted to $33,756,549. This includes arrears or the accumulation between the time from which the allowance of pen sions dates and the time of actually granting the certificates. Although the law of 1890 permits pensions for dis ability not related to military service, yet as a requisite to its benefits a disability must exist incapacitating applicants from the performance of manual labor to suoh a degree 03 to render them nnable to earn a support. Execution of this law in its early stages does not seem to have been in accord with its true intention, but to ward the close of the last administration an authorized construction was given to the statute and since that time this con struction has been followed. This had the effect of limiting the operations of the law to its intended purposes. The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds the commissioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized, pending a complete examination, giving notice to the pensioners in order that they might have an opportunity to establish, if pos sible, the justice of their claims, notwith standing apparent invalidities. This, 1 understand, is the practice whioh has for a long time prevailed in the ponsion bureau,' but after entering upon these recent investigations the commissioner modified this rule so as not to allow, until after a complete examination, interfer ence with the payment of a pension, Bp porently not altogether ""void but w nich merely had been fixtd at a rate higher than that authorized by the law. I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposod and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon tho kindly sentiment in which pensions have their origin. Every fraudulent pensioner has become a bad citizen; every false oath in support of a pension has become perjury most common, and serves to rob the people not only of their money, but of tho patriotic sentiment whioh the survivors of a war fought for the preservation of the Union who ought tojhave and which should inspire thousands of neighborheods to have well known fraudulent pensioners dropped from the list. Recent developments by tho bureau establish' appalling conspiracies toward pension frauds, By no means the least wrong done is to worthy and deserving pensioners who utterly ought not to be condemned to such aspersions, nor Bhoutd those who attempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs bo accused of enmity or indifference to tlia claims of honest men. The sum expended on account of pen sions for the year ending June 80, 1893, was $156,740,467.14. The commissioner estimates that $1(15,000,000 will be re quired to pay pensions during the year ending June SO, 1894 The Indians. The condition of the Indians and their ultimate fate are subjects which are re lated to a sacred duty of the government and which strongly appeal to the sense of justice and the sympathy of onr peo ple. Our Indians number about 248,000. Most of them are located on 161 reserva tions containing 86,116,531 acres of land. About 110,000 of these Indians have in a largo degree developed civilized customs. Lands in severalties have been alloted to many of them; such allotments have been made to 10,000 individuals, during the last fiscal year embracing . about 1,000,000 acres. f I am sure that secular education and moral and religious teaching must be im portant factors in any effort to .save the Indians and lead them to civilization. I believe, too, that the relinquishment of tribal relations and the holding of land in severalty may result in favorable con ditions and toward this consumation. It seems to me, however, that all allotments of land in severalty ought to be made with great care ahd circumspection. There is danger of great abuses Creep ing into the prosecution of claims for In on long time with low Interest

Cattle Diseases. The secretary of agriculture in his re port says the regulation of 1892 concern ing Texas fever has been enforced during the last year, and the large stock yards of the country have been free from infec tion. Occasional local outbreaks have largely been Bnch as conld have been effectually guarded against by the owners of the afflicted cattle Tuberculosis is a disease wide spread and more dangerous to human life than pleuro-pneumonia. Investigations have been made during the past year as to the means of its commu nication and the method of its correct diagnosis. Much progress has been made in this direction by the students of the division of animal pathology, but the work ought to be extended in co-operation with local authorities until the dan ger to human life arising from this cause is reduced to a minimum. Civil Service Law. The continued intelligent-execution of the civil service law, in the increasing approval by the people of its operation is most gratifying. I am, if possible, more than ever convinced of the incal culable benefits conferred, by the civil service law. Gcononiy. Economy in public expenditures is a duty that can not be neglected by those entrusted with the control of money drawn from the people for publia uses. It must be confessed that our apparently endless resources, the familiarity of our people with immense accumulations of wealth, the growing sentiment among them that the expenditures of public money should in sorao manner inure to their immediato and personal advantage, the indirect and almost Btealthy manner in which a larger part of our taxes are exacted and a degenerated sense of official accountability have led to growing extravagance in governmental appropriations. At this time when a deploted public treasury confronts us, when many of our people are engaged in a hard struggle for tho necossaries of life and whon forced economy is pressing upon the great masses of our countrymen, I de sire to urge with all the earnestness at my command that congressional legisla tion be so limited by strict economy, as to indicate an appreciation of the condi tion of the treasury and a sympathy with tho straightened circumstances of our fellow citizens. The duty of publio economy is also of immense importance in its estimate and necessary relation to the task now in band of raising revenue to meet government expenditures and yet reducing the people's burden of federal taxation. The Tariff. After a hard struggle tariff reform is aotually bofore uh. Nothing so import ant claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents itself as both an oppor tunity and a duty. An opportnnity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow citi zens and a duty imposed upon us by our oft repeated professions and by the em phatic mandate of the people. After full discussion, our countrymen have spoken in favor of this reform and they have con fided the work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged. If thero is anything in the theory of A representation in publio places of the people and their desires, if publio officers are really servants of the people, and if political promises and pro fessions have any binding force, onr fail ure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancv. Nothing should in terfere to distract our attention or dis turb our effort until this reform is accom plished by wise and careful legislation. While we should staunchly adhere to the principles that only the necessity of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation and that they should be limited by strict economy, we can not close our eyes to the fact that conditions have grown up nmong us which in justice and fairness call for dis criminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emer gencies of our government actually de mand. Manifestly if we are to aid the people directly thorugh tariff reform one of its most obvious features should be a reduc tion in the tariff charges upon the neces saries of life. The benefits of such a re duction would be palpable and substan tially felt by thousands who would be better fed, better clothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the will ing benefactions of a government whose highest function is the promotion of the welfare of the people. Not less closely related to our peoples' prosperity and well-being is the removal of restrictions upon importations of rawmaterials neces sary to our own manufacturers. The world should be open to our national in genuity and enterprise. In view of these facts the enormous ex penditures without legitimate returns of benefits ought to be abolished. A meas ure has been proposed by the appropri ate congressional committee embodying tariff reform on the lines herein sug gested which will be promptly submitted i - i i i i : T. -- il. 1 1 c ' ior legislative aciiuu. ic is tne result ox much patriotic and unselfish work and I believe it deals with its subject con sistently and ns thoroughly as. existing conditions permit. I am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided, for in the proposed legislation added to existing internal revenue taxation will in the near future, thongh perhaps not immediately, provide sufficient revenue to meet tho needs of the government. An Income Tax. The committee, after full consideration and to provide against a temporary defi ciency which may exist before the busi ness of the oountry adjusts itself to the new tariff schedules, have wisely embraced RIO GRANDE LAND COMPANY, Las Cruces, N El. Awarded Highest The only pre Cream of Tartar Powder. No Ammonia; No Alum. Used in Millions of Homes 40 Years the Standard in their plan a few additional internal revenuo taxes, including a small tax upon incomes derived from certain corporation investments. These new assessments art not only absolutely just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such as can be remitted without unfavor able business disturbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists. In my great desir e for the success of this measure 1 can not refrain from the suggestion that its success can only be obtained by means of an unselfish course on the part of the friends of tariff reform and a result of their willingness to subor dinate personal deaires and ambitions to the general good. The local interests affected by the proposed reform are so numerous and so various that if all are insisted upon tho legislation embodying the reform must inevitably fail. In conclusion, my intense feoling of responsibility compels me to invoke for the manifold interests of a generous and confiding people the most unscrupulous core, and to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the ad vancement of the greatness and pros perity of our beloved country.
