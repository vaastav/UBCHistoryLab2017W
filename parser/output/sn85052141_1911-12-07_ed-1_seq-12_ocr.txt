&KiftM Picking a Present k& Platt In-DOUGLASMAUOCH HEN Harry Platt and tbat girl friend of tbo Greens (I forget her name) were married. It was one of those my-gcodness gracious just-thlnk-of-that nf- fain, with no one in on the secret except tho suburban minister who tied the knot, the cab man who drive thorn out thero and the Ctrl from the minister's kitchen who was a witness, and left a thumb-print of grease on the certificate (she was frying doughnuts at the time) and the minister's wife (at least the name was the same). Let's see, wbero was IT .Oh. yes, when the Piatts were mar ried, It being that kind of a wedding, there was no chance to send them a wedding gift as I would hare liked to do, or to hare done, (whichever is proper, or grammatical, though I'm aura I can never tell which) .But Mr. Platt la ono of the nicest men In the offloe, that Is, he was before this happened. So I felt we ought to do something for him, Just to show our good will and, anyhow, we're dug down for others we thought much less of. so why shouldn't we for him? , But the wedding was over, without In-, YlUtloM, or even a reception, and' they were housekeeping before we knew it So what could we do? Well, Just then Christmas came long not Just then that two months iter the wedding. iThey were mar ked October 29, wo It waant Quite (two months, but that's close enough. When Christmas came .long, that Is. just before It came along, I sug gested that we make up a purse and giro them a sort of delayed wedding present. Just to show our good will. Every body thought It waa a splendid Mea, that is, of course, except Mr. Platt, whom, of course, I didn't con cult. So I got up a subscription paper went to everybody In the office i(cept Mr. Platt, of course). I got' MH.tO, Including ten cents from the jjaaltor, who wasn't expected to give anything but wanted to give some thing, which shows Just bow popular Mr. Platt was with everyone In the Gliding, when a Janitor even would kip la. Christmas shopping Is hard enough, joodness knows, when you do It for ymraelf; but when you do It for a lock company capitalized at $26.60, wna x stockholders, with 28 different kinds of Ideas and tastes, then Christ hopping rises above a mero an oyance to the dignity of a real trou le. And that's what I was ud against I thought It would be nice to get an expression of opinion. So I went around one morning and asked for Mean. But I couldn't get a word. No- Body could think of anything. I couant myself. At noon I went teat and looked. I walked miles. I priced, then I went back to the office. Tou should have seen ay desk. Honest, you would have thought some one had turned In a gon ral alarm. They couldn't wait for me to get back. There they were 28 of them, (that la, 27, or 28 with me). They all had suggestions, and they i all different. The head book keeper thought an arm chair would bo nice. (He stands up all day). The collec tor thought a rain coat would be best, while Miss J.ones suggested a dress pattern. They all said, of courso, that they left it entirely to me; and then each went away sadly, aa much as to Bay that he hoped I wouldn't be so foolish aa to bay any of thoso other things that the others had proposed. i This Handsome
