THE OUTLOOK FOR VOSBERYATIOS r« a.l who have observed with admiration President Itoosevelt's efforts for the conserva tion "f national rcsoun-es it lmi^t be a source of satisfaction to nuie Low completely In ac- : curd \vhh that policy is iho ["resideut-e.ect. Mr. I Taft placed bucself distinctly on record lust ■ Tue.sda\ on bereral essential points. He ad- : vises i:.*kiuz die plan for internal Improve- ; inent comprehensive enough lo include all parts ; of the country. If the vast expenditure re- I quired for most <jf these works cannot be met by »riTin»i appropriations, he favors the issue J of bouds proposed by Mr. Roosevelt. Finally, ! since no one state is financially able to carry ; on such enterprises single handed, he realizes that co-operation between the states and the j natJun is demauil«*d. Though Bucb an indorse- I ment was probably unnecessary, an affirmation of the lepitiinafy of the measures now under ; consideration by n constitutional lawyer of Judge Taft's experience Is at least worthy of note. As President Roosevelt pointed out nt the ; joint m*- • _■ of the consultation committee of i the Conservation Commission and Hilled or- i ;mnlznt:'i::"v it 1s lire possible to make a ; Ix'^hinlnj In the development of .-in Inland I vratarwr^v.

Within the next two or three months an excel lent opportunity will be afforded for the major ity of the state governments to show their prac tical sympathy with the movement begun last May. Since the conference of governors, held at the White Boose at that time, several new executives have been chosen. But whether the re-sitonsibilUies of state administration have been shifted to different shoulders o: not. It is Inconceivable that in any commonwealth be tween the Atlantic .-in.l Pacific coasts there can be ■ lack of familiarity with the subject itself. At least forty legislatures Convene in January, and they will all receive messages from the Governors of their respective states. If those communications do not jrlve cordial approval to a proposition of such importance as co-operation with the national 'mrlties In the work of conservation it w *%► c a stransre oversight. Even If legislative action Is not immediately In vited, the temptation will assuredly be strong to show a spirit of reciprocity. 1/7?. 

CORTELYOU'S REPORT. The need of economy this year gives special pertinency to Secretary Cortelyou's recommenda tions regarding the regulation of the national budget. The Secretary .-nils attention to the fact that, excluding the interest on the public debt, the ordinary expenditures of the govern ment have risen from $135,000400 In 1878 to ?635.000.000 in 1908, nearly 400 per cent in a generation, and he says that if the tine comes •when a session of Congress Is given over largely "to the consideration of ways nad means to re "duce the operating expenses of the government •'and patriotic and discriminating judgment Is "brought to bear on the problem, we shall see a "saving of many millions of dollars, with no sac rifice of efficiency of administration." A great cause of extravagance, in the Secre tary's opinion. is the lack of system In the prep aration of the budget, which Is subject to no businesslike control. The Executive has no In fluence over it except to veto it as a whole or sign it as a whole. The Treasury Department which is charged with the responsibility of meet ing its demands, has nothing to say regarding its preparation. It is made up by Congress without particular regard for prospective revenues, being the result largely of logrolling among members who combine to further their own local appro priations. In a word, being prepared by the Legislature, !t has the weakness of the legislative system about it that is to say. too much regard for local considerations and too little for na tional considerations enter into Its determina tion. Bach Congressman has everything to gain by "spending money" in his district and nothing to gain by saving money for the country at large. Mr. Cortelyou suggests that Congress vest In a. Joint committee the power to revise the budget with reference to the prospective revenue of the year and with regard to the relative Importance of the objects fcr which appropriations are sought. Perhaps this would Insure for tbe bud get such a consideration as the finance minister under a ministerial government bestows, but It would be hard to lift such a Joint committee as Mr. Cortelyou proposes above the local point of view so powerful in Congress. Budgets are pre pared as they are because economy has never In this country become a pressing necessity nnd a political Issue, so as to cause parties to be held responsible for tbe amount of expenditure. When that condition comes, if it ever does come, party discipline will subordinate the local to the gen eral interest. Then su'-h regulation of the budget as Mr Cortelyou urges will be accomplished, perhaps, in a way somewhat similar to that which he proposes. On the subject of currency reform Mr. Cortel ymi has made a stride forward in the last year. It will be remembered Thnt In last year's report h* 1 declared himself convinced of the need of an elastic currency, snd described succinctly and clearly the obj<v-?s whico such a currency should seek to accomplish: but be wrote ihat he had "no pride of opinion" as. to how the need>ii quality should be imparted. This ye.ir he s.-iys thnt conditions "call for the ultimate :s: s ; '- ""nient. if It can I ■ - . irdi Isoae to keep it ■■<>ut of the domain of politics on the one hand "and the control of pre;it moneyed inter* - '•the other, of a central institution of Issue and reserve." Mr. Cortelyou thus r.inges himself among tbe advocates of a < entr.il narional bauk, in favor of which there is undoubtedly ,/! grow inir sentiment among public men in Washington Another suggestion in this Interesting and thoughtful report, that regarding the possibility of reducing international gold m vements, obvi ously sprinz? from the panic of last year, ui'h the extraordinary shipments it entailed. Mr. Cortelyou suggests that nn "international gold certificate" would be a desirable and economical substitute for the metr;] itself In many "f these movements. But preliminary to anything <>f that - - • is country must pet Its own currency sys tem In order. hvA when we have a proper cur ■ d of such a substitute for Its int -ravels will be greatly reduced, for the I'siitM states has been the worst offender among the nations :u importing gold whenever its rigid currencj was unequal to the demands of business. If this country had such a central bank « if issue and reserve as Mr. Gortelyea advocates the gold movement would fali off of Itself, and such a bank could co-op erate with the great banks of Europe in effecting such further economies In international ex change as mife'ht be found practicable. HAYTI IN THE DEPTHS. The installation of the victorious insurgent General Simon ns provisional President of Hnyti, with comparatively little violence, Is to be regarded with some measure of relief. sin<'i* tii<-- thing was i" be done, it ifl well to ha- i it dci with as little savagery as possible Those optimistically inclined may in addition hope t-hnt the result will lie pood. It is not im possible th::t • .' era I Simon will be chosen constitutional President by the free suffrnpos of the people, that be will make a capable and up right chief of state, and that under his benefi cent administration Hayti will enter upon a new era of peace and prosperity. There are those who contend that the age of miracles Is not past, and we would not quench the smoking flax of their faith. Hut from the point of view of unsentimental worldly wisdom there seems to be little to ex pect save a fresh spoliation of the state for selfish gain, fresh Intrigues and plots by dissat isfied spoils seekers and then a fresh revolution which will replace Dictator Simon with Dic tator Somebody Else, the whole civic, social and Industrial organism of the Black Republic meantime suffering increased demoralization and depredation. Except to those who can pee a pot of goto 1 nt the foot of the rainbow there Is only an infinitesimal promise of cnythlnp but evil in this triumphant Insurrection. There inevitably n risen the qoeston of the ri " bta the responsibilities nn-l tli* datlr 8 of oth.-r nation*, and particularly of the United States, In relation to such n state of affairs. We have pointoi out the melancholy rat t that !ia\ ti's great and powerful neighbors have been in a .-erasure accountable for her demoraliza tion, partly because of their neglect of her welfare and partly. it is to be feared, because of the more or less malicious meddling which has been permitted, if not encouraged. That fact may not Indicate occasion or Justification for any attempt at making amends by benefi cent intervention.

GOOD YffTTS FOR 

MOTORISTS. The mtefests of atttomobUtng, for pleasure or in business, arc decideVily looking ap In the State of New Jersey, where there BBS been probably as much need of their improvement as anywhere In nil the world. A ir.an lone notorious for his 6V*flanC« Of law nnd decency nnd for his> persistent imp>rlll!ng of lives has been expelled from the New Jersey Auto and Motor Vehicle Club, the Influence of his wealth and the specious plea of his own self caused infirmity no longer availing to protect him from the penalty which he deserves. Another. af f er killing a man with his myhine and then running away to avoid recofcnr.ioii. has been detected, arrested and coiaedtted without ball on a charge of manslaughter Some fault has been found with New Jersey because of the alleged llliberadry of her highway laws, and it Is said that many automoblllsts have formed a prejudice against the state on that account. We should think that Mew Jer sey's record this week would be sufficient to place her in high favor. No action could easily be conceived which would be of truer benefit to the vast majority of automoblllsts thau this wbli h her authorities, official and Bjsjofflcial, have taken in these two cusps. POLICE STATISTICS. It is perhaps hard to judge of the efficiency of the Police Department from statistics aione, and it is impossible to compare Us efficiency under t b-- present Commissioner with its efficiency ur der his predecessors on tuar basis whoa those predecessors lefr no statistics worthy of the name: but so far as statistics go the department under General Binghnm has made steady prog ress. The total arrests of the police for the third quarter of this year number C>4 29<i nnd the total convictions 38,538. In the same quar ter of last year they v^'re 53,508 and 30345, re spectively, and in the same quarter of lOOrt - 358 and 2."i.L'7s. Thus it will bo observed that not only have the arrests Increased in number, but that the proportion of <-onvictions to arrests has steadily ctfvance<l. being •"•'-' per cent for the third quarter of 19Ofi. ."<; per cent for the same period of ]!>>7 and 59 per cent for tbe same period in 1908. If statistics for the first three quarte-s of the last three years are compared the result is the same. Arrests for the ilrst thm* quarters In 1906 were U£33B, In I!niT 147,204 and in 190S 186,968. Convictions for the first three quarters of 10O« were 7--V-MC.. of T^<7 82,096 and of 1908 110,655. Both arrests and convictions show a marked advance in 190S, and assuming that the statistics aw Just as complete for tho two years before, there has been a distinct increase In police activity this yenr. No comparison with the results under earlier commissioners Is possible, for no comr lete sta tistics were kept by them. Bat this \ cry con trast Is something In General Blngham's favor. He is Introducing system into the department where none existed before, and In m< re ways than in the mere keeping of statistics. With system inevitably goes better discipline. 

ELECTRICITY OS THE CESTRAL. From the decision which the New Yjrk Cen tral is said tn have reached, to extend its electric service from Mount Yernon to White Plains on the Harlem division, it may be inferred, that the company is well satisfied with the working of the new system for the last two years. Only one serious accident has happened since Its use of electricity began, and that was by no means clearly attributable to a change In traction methods.' Derailment from the spreading of the track on a curve micht have occurred with a steam locomotive, especially if, through limited experience or excessive zeal, the engineer slightly exceeded the proper speed. With this possible exception, the record since the Initiation of the new system is one of which the company may well be proud. Avoidance of the old nuisances in the Park avenue tunnel — stfam. cin ders and the pases of combustion — together with a quicker acceleration of movement after a stop, has strongly commended the company to Its patrons, and has caused such commuters as If beyond the present limits of the electric zone to pray for an enlargement of their privi leges. But for the financial stringency which for the last year has discouraged many Indus trial ventures, perhaps tbe Central -would have undertaken to gratify this -wish before. The Trial of a direct current and a third rail, characteristic features of the Central* method of employing the new motive power, has evi dently satisfied the company that it made no mistake in its choice. In addition to whatever economy may result from a substitution of elec tricity for steam, the plan adopted on the Harlem and Hudson River divisions has obvious rec ommendations. The third rail Is no menace to employes or even to intruders on the company's right of way. It carries a current of sccfa a low voltage that it cannot kill. In the last two yean no one has been hurt by it and the third rail has other advantages. It can more easily be shifted with the track than some of the more elaborate overhead constructions now In vogue. Derailment, by knocking down a frame supporting four wires, might paralyze the ser vice on other tracks than the one on which the accident occurred. No such consequence nee 3 be expected where the third rail system is em ployed. - f !^ 7 (??Tfl3 The alternating current system has undeni able merits where long lines are to be operated by electricity, but these are partly offset by t)\o drawbacks to a suspended conductor. To get the full benefit of the alternating current an unusually high voit.icre must be employe nnd lionre the wire which conducts it must he ptit ip <-ut of harm* way. Whit will he the final preference of the rallrondn for trunk line nervire In probably not yet determined, but for slmrt distances the Central's experience with the third rail and direct current mam be con sidered highly encouraging Now thru thf-rf has actually been flshlns; In Union Square, who will blame Ingenuous allona for Imagining that there may still b« buffalo hunting In Broadway?
