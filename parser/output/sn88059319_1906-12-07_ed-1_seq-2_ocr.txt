In 1896, Bryan received In Iowa 223,741 votes, and Palmer, gold demo crat received 4,516, and these latter adherents of the Cleveland democracy, aided by a few of their sympathizers who remained with Bryan to main tain their "regularity" asd not be cause -they admired or believe in either tha man or his principles, are now engaged in a desperate contest to secure the appointment of one of their number as a member of the Democratic National Committee from Iowa, to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of 0. A. Walsh. Through shrewd political maneuv ering and a lulliig to sleep of the real democracy of the state by the eBtab lishmentof a "harmony headquar ters" In Des Moines in charge of the temporary state ohalrman C. W. Mil ler and Walt Butler, the latter pre sumably under pay of Miller and his backers to be used to decoy the Bryan democrats of the state, with whom Butler claims companionship, into the camp of the corporation demo crats. With this cry of harmony it was easy to take advantage of the earnest desire of the Bryan democrats for success in the state oampalgn and ere the latter realized it the party machinery of the state was in control of the Palmer and Buckner element and their friends and W. W. Marsh, one of their number, a Bryan bolter in 1896, and a member of the Chicago rump rate convention was put forth by the state committee as their can didate for national committeeman. To oppose him the Bryan men brought out Cato Sells, but at Sells' sugges tion,-to promote the chances of suc cess of the democrats of Iowa in the recent election, the fight was post poned until afier the campaign. Sells claims the majority of the national committee and the endorse ment of Bryan and the true-blue, progressive democrats who have kept the faith and policies of the party alive from 1896 to the present time. Mr. Marsh realized that he was bea ten, and in fact was advised by Mr. Bryan to withdraw, and he did so, but the committee persisted In their determlmation to secure the appoint ment of one of their kind and en dorsed Judge Wade for the position man of "eminent respeotabllity," It is true, but a democrat who never was In sympathy with Bryan or his Everything to make it up Fine. onr guarantee policies and who during his term in congress maintained a consistent 'conservative" democratic reoord for doing nothing for the public and did not secure the oonfldenoe of bis con stituents to such an extent ati to pre vent his defeat for re-election by a young man, comparatively unknown and wholly untried for the position. Judge Wade has never been known to ally himself with, or in any way aid the progressive element of the demo cratic party. To prevent the factional fight en* gendered by the action of the state committee, Sells offered to ttitttSraw, if Judge Wade would do likewise-,-in' favor of Claude Porter, who agreed to accept the office In the interest'of the party in Iowa. Wade, however, will not agree to do this, and as a result the democracy of the state Is in a turmoil over the attempt of the bolt ers and their sympathizers to control the democracy of the state who pol led the largest democratic vote In the history of the state in 1896. Walt Butler has shown himself to be a tool of the Miller-Marsh Cleveland democrats, for while pro fessing to be a Bryan man, he is writ ing to the county ohalrmen. of the Btate asking for tbelr endorsement of Judge Wade. How Butler or aby true friend of Bryan can ask this 1b beyond our comprehension. If the democracy of Iowa or the nation Is to succeed, It must free itself from all corporation or money-power control, and men of known affiliation with the trusts,'Cor porations and financial plunderers must take their place in the rankB instead of posing as the leaders of the PBrty—the great common people will not follow such leadership. In the interests of the democratic party and the great mass of people whom it should truly represent, the state committee and its allies should desist from injuring tbe party and its Influence with the people by forcing tbe election of a representative of the minority of the party against the wishes of an overwhelming majority. However, should the comnlitte^ "ac complish their purpose It will devolve upon the progressive democrats of the state to cast them out In an unmis takable manner ftt tbiS next stat&ttm vention, and then se6 to it that if they continue in the paty they do so as bumble workers in the ranks as best befits the returning prodigal* Bryan, in his last Commoner says "Be on guard lest the party be crip pled by an organization out of harmd ny with the party's purposes," audjal so says: "Let every aspirant for a position In the party organization be scruti nized. If his present position or his past record is open to objection, let him stand aside.

The democracy of Howard county is strongly in favor of Bryan and his principles, but representatives—and active ones, too—of the "compromis ing," *8bhservatlve" and ple-above princlple element are always at work In tbe county also, and tbe proKres slve, militant Bryan democrats of the county-must jealously safeguard their interests and principles, for no stream can rise above its level, and no party oan or will be stronger or better than its source of strength—its voters among the plain people. Watoh your primaries and caucuses closely, attend them and actively participate therein, seeing that you are not misrepresent ed in any convention, and if you do so the democracy will have no need io the fbture to purge itself of the Rog er Sulllvans, the Wall Street demo Qritts the Tom Taggarts and the rest of-the crew who are sapping the very life of the democratic party.

WHAT TO GIVE "HIM." P. A. Clemmer Has a Confidential Talk with Cresco Women, "Oh Atari what shall we give him?" has betitt'tihe sigh of many a woman inQresco the past two weeks, think ing ortather, husband, big brother, or possibly some one else's brother. P. A. Clemmer wants us to confi dentially tell every women reader of the PLAIN DBALER that "the proper nunp-Co glvB 'him,' the gift that will be sure to please if he is a smoker,is a box of Wads worth Brothers' Chico cigars." "The best judges of oigars in Cresco,'' Mid P. 'A'. Clemmer, "have given their endorsement of the Chico by smoking nothing else. They formerly smoked ten and fifteen cent cigars, but now nothing will do them but the Chioo, even though it is not an expensive smoke.

BILL TO OUST ALL NEGROES FROM ARMY Representative Slayden, of Texae, Would Purge Nation's Fighting Force of What He Declares la a "Dangerous Element." Washington, Dec. 5. President Roosevelt's annual message to con gress occupied the attention of the senate as soon as the opening pre liminaries were concluded Tuesday. These included the receipt of mes sages from the house reciting deaths of several of its members. The committee appointed to notify the president that congress was ID session made its report through Sen ator Hale of Maine. The reading of the message began at 12:11 o'clock. Many senators were in their seats and the message loeeived careful at tention. Baron Rosen, the Russian ambassador, accompanied by two members of his embassy staff, occu pied the diplomatic gallery during tbe reading of the message. House Hears Message. Following the reading of the Jour nal in the house the committee ap pointed by the speaker Monday to Join a like committee from the sen ate to wait upon the president re ported that they had performed that service and that he would communi cate in writing to the congress. The house after waiting for a few min utes on motion of Mr. Payne of New York, took a recess for 15 minutes. Close and careful attention wa accorded the reading of the presi dent's message by the members of the house. The galleries also showed great interest in the document. The president's views on the inherit ance and income taxes pleased the Democrats, Representative Champ Clark of Missouri, expressing the: sentiment that the "president had stolen, taken away and converted to his own use another plank of the Democrats." Serious consideration was given to that portion of the mes sage relating to the Japanese ques tion. The reading of th.fe message was concluded at 2:50 p. m., and five min utes later the house adjourned until 12 o'clock Wednesday. Ready to Tell Senate. President Roosevelt made It appar ent to his senatorial callers during the day that he is anxious for speedy action on a congressional reaolutlon calling for Information regarding the discharge of negro soldiers of the Twenty-fifth infantry far participate ing in the riot at Brownsville. As soon as a resolution if, passed he told them, he will send the information to the senate. The president further stated that either tie Penrose or the Poraker resolution will be acceptable to him. Would Oust Negroes from Army. Representative Slayden, of Texas, Introduced a bill which provides that "on or before ttie 30th day of June, 1907, all enlisted men of the army who are negr0@g or of negro descent shall be discharged from the service of the United States and thereafter no negro or person of negro descent shall be en listed or appointed hi the army of the United States." In explaining his bill Mr. Slayden said: "The bill speaks for itself. It was not introduced for buncombe. My pur pose is to give the congress of the United States an opportunity to purge the army of an admittedly dangerous element. To say that the negroes are, brave is not an argument against this measure. Many men have been brave, in fact most men are ia the matter ofi fighting. The Comanche and Sioux' Indians were as brave as men can be. But no one would seriously suggest that we ultimately recruit regiments from them, put guns in their hands and station them near companies of white troops, toward whom they entertain Inherent race hostility. The Twenty fifth infantry is manifestly imbued with the same raoe hostility and events have shown it to be Quite as dangerous as the Slour or Comanche would be." Cousins Given MItt'a Position. Speaker Cannon Announced the pro motion of Reprerjentatlve Robert G.' Cousins to the chairmanship of the house committee, on foreign affairs, made vacant by the death of Repre sentative Robew R.

The o:iistence in Sioux City of what resembles a Black Hand society came to light In connection with the police court cases against Arthur Premo, who Avas arrested for threatening to shoot Police Matron Thurston. Claim ing that Premo was not capable of caring for Ills three children, the po lice matron was instrumental in hav ing them given to the Boys' and Girls' home, a charitable institution, by Judge Mould. In Premo's trial a let ter was Introduced which was sent to one of the officers of the Boys' and Girls' home, signed the "Cowboy Gang," containing the threat that the recipient and her son would be killed and two other officers of the home put out of the way unless the Premo children were restored to their pa rents. "We are a big bunch of cow boys," says the letter, "and we do not go to law. We fight and we kill. Un less you produce those children we will get you and your crowd. Don't delay, for we are not making a bluff." For eight pages the letter runs on, con taining threats in almost every line. The officers of the home, who are among Sioux City's leading women, have been terrorized by the threats, and hardly dare leave their homes. The police have been appealed to for protection.

Their cries for help drowned by tho noise made by the dredge, Jack Whit ney, twenty-one years old, employed on a dredge which is digging the Purgatory slough canal at Manson, was drowned and the fireman of the dredge had a narrow escape from sharing his fate and only reached shore after a terrible struggle In the icy waters.

Whitney could not swim, but both managed to cling to the overturned boat while they cried lustily for help. The noise made by the engine of the dredge prevented their cries from be ing heard, and at last exhausted by his struggles, Whitney loosened his hold on the boat and drowned. His companion drifted into shallow water, when he waded ashore. Hurled About Shaft. Roy Campbell, engineer at the candy factory at Waterloo, received serious injuries and had a most mi raculous escape from death while at work. In some manner his arm caught in a belt and he was carried around a rapidly whirling shaft, each revolution of which banged him heav ily against the beams of the celling, only eighteen inches above. Camp bell made no outcry, and one of the girls who witnessed his predicament was so frightened that she could not give the alarm for some minutes. When finally the engine was stopped, it was necessary to cut away the belt and much of Campbell's clothing be fore he could be released. Game Warden Indloted. As the outcome of a curious case in which a justice of the peace arraigned and fined himself for violation of the game law, Henry Yody, a deputy game warden, has been indicted for extor tion at Vinton. Frank Lowe, justice, fined himself and his brother, George, $20 each, and both being without the money, gave notes, the paper being accepted by the justice.

THE "RAINY DAY" In everybody's life the pro verbial "rainy day" is pretty sure to come, sooner or later. Fortunate indeed is the person who, when it arrives, is prepared for it. The way for persons of moderate means to ^uard ag-ainst the needs of the "rainy day," is to inaugurate now a systematic plan of saving. Most persons who are improvident do not mean to be so. They either do not understand the importance of small economies or they have neglected to save because they have never tried apractical system.
