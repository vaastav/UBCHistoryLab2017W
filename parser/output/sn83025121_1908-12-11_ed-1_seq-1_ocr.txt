A meeting of Japancso morchanta and others has been called for tonight lor the purpose of considering plans for "bringing about a general Increase of 2ay for the Japanese laborers on tho plantations. The meeting was arranged "by Fred Maklno, proprietor of the drug storo and a leader in many of tho recent movements among tho Japanese laborers, and Q.

A circular letter calling tho meeting and stating the' object was sent around among the Japaneso yesterday. Tho meeting will be held this even ing at the Japanese night school on street and it is stated that a ; Tier of inflammatory speeches are to be made. opinion among mo iionoimu It merchants and professional men is Tory much dvmaea over tne japancso laborers' pay question, tho majority of them being not in favor of precipitating any movement that might result in labor disturbances in Hawaii. These reason that tho matter ot pay-is a matter that will be adjustod without industrial disturbances if proceeded in in a quiet way, tho question of tho worth of labor being ono of supply and demand. On tho other hand there are some Japaneso leaders who are in favor of demanding an immediate increase in the pay of tho laborers, arguing that tho demand now is -.greater than the supply but no corresponding increase in pay has followed. These leaders do not regard the suggestion that their actions may incito the laborers to striko as anything disturbing. The influences of the conservatives are being used to make tonight's meeting of as littlo consequenco as possible.

Competitive plans. Cablo ad dresses of Dickoy, Traphagen, Dole and Nowcomb. PBEAE. Tho men mentioned in the latter part of tho messngo are all architects who have practised thoir profession hero nnd are familiar with climate and conditions. They are C. H. Dickoy, now of Oakland; O. G. Traphagen, now of Ban Francisco; S. A. P. Nowcomb, of Mass, and Herbert Dolo of Now York. Tho lattor Is a nophow of Jiidgo Sanford B. Dolo. "I take this to mean," said Acting Governor Mott Smith, "that Governor Prear has disregarded the statement. so frequently mado that tho Treasury Department never puts up any pnblio buildings except those designed by its own architects, and has gone to work to get and has succeeded in getting our building thrown open to competitive design, and is anxious to got architects fwho havo lived hero and know tho con ditions as well as those who now livo here, to enter tho competition, which will insuro designs adapted to tho climate and conditions. "It means also, that wo aro to got our building vory soon. Tho fact that tho Governor wanted tho addresses of these men cabled, would indicate that the competition for designs is to bo thrown opon at once. ' ' Tab site question is settled now apparently for good." Tho news that the Mahuka sito had been fully determined on quickly spread, throughout tho community and was generally received with great satisfaction. Jt .indicated that Governor Prcar as soqn as ho found out what tho of tho community was, got in nnd did strong work for it. There has not yet -been time for anything but the riblcd reports of tho feeling hero to lmio reached Washington. Tho data which has been compiled in regard both to the Bito and tho history of its selection' went forward by tho Korea and lias only today reached San Francisco. Noithor H. E. Coopor nor any other representatio of tho Irwin interests cared to express any opinions on tho question of tho sito selection. THE ITALIAN L v SUPPLY IS LARGE In Udw of tho fact that an attempt is to be made to send Italian laborers to Hawaii to help out tho labor situation in thp Islands, the following figures given out last month by tho Italian liureau of Emigration aro of interest: Tho total number -of persons who emigrated frpm Italy during tho first three quarters of this year was 08,128, nnd 48,096 went to the United States. Tho total number of repatriations was 222,31)2, and 173,007 roturned from America. During the corresponding period in 1907 tho number of emigrants to Amoricn was 201,000 and of repatriations only 02,020. Emigration is decreasing to Argentina and Brazil also, wlulo repatriations from these countries aro increasing. A great number of roturned emigrants have onough monoy saved to keep them, but the majority aro destitute. -H THE NAVAL POSITION IN PACIFIC OCEAN "With regard to tho suggestion, which is once more put forward, that the British admiralty should station permanently a large sqnadron in tho North Pacific, it need hardly be said, remarks tho Naval and Military that at present there is no indication that tho naval authorities intend in any way to depart from their present policy. There is no reason to think that a British fleet of armored ships is any more necessary now than in the immediate past. No other power has today, or intends to have in tho near future, a large fleet permanently in ho Pacific, except Japan. By Christmas next there will not be a single battleship in the Pacific, apart from tho vessels of our ally. Tho American Bhips by that timo will bo on their way bqmo to the Atlantic, and the balance of naval power in the Pacific will then be the same as it was before the Atlantic fleet set out J from San Francisco carlv in tbo present year, Germany will continue, according to present plans, to be represented in the Far East by a naval force eon. sidernbly less than IiaU as powerful as that under the British flag; tbo French squadron will still be of modest proportions, and the allied fleets of Great Britain and Japan will bo supreme.

It is a model organization that wnB held up by Commissioner Nowell for tho Hawaiian growers to pattern from. It -works for its members for cost, tho selling charges being only sufficient to koop tho affairs of tho exchange run- The interest taken by Mr. "Wiggins in tho suggested combination is because tho headquarters of tho Exchange are in Los Angeles and it is his idea that through the shipment of Hawaii's pine and banana crpp to San Pedro for distribution tho question of return froight cargoes for San Pedro Honolulu Ueamers would bo sottled. So enthusiastic is Mr. Wiggins in tho matter and so thoroughly has he convinced Mr. Storoy of tho possibilities in it, that Mr. Storey has written that if the Hawaiian pincapplo men want to for,m a local oxchango as a branch of tho Southern California Exchange, he will come to Hawaii and assist ,thcra in organizing.
