ASKS AUTHORITY TO DISMISS President Suggests Changes in Laws Re lating to Official Tenure. Washington, Dec. B.—The president has sent a special message to congress urging giving the executive authority of his own initiative and own respon sibility to dismiss any officer whom he thicks unworthy to remain in the service. The law at present provides that in time of peace no officer shall be dis missed except in pursuance of a court martial. This provision the president desires repealed. Illustrating the necessity for the legislation desired, the president cites the case of a naval officer, whose name is not given, but who was accused of "indecent and disgusting behavior." He was convicted, but the court, to his surprise, the president states, did not sentence him to dismissal. The president also urges the repeal of arti cle 37 for the government of the navy, which in time of war practically sub jects his right of dismissal to review by a court martial, to be assembled within six months, if the accused offi cer demands this court

START A FUND FOR INDUSTRIAL PEACE Washington, Dec. II. —President Roosevelt yesterday received official notification that he had been awarded the Nobel peace prize of nearly $40, --000. The president is unwilling to profit personally by his efforts and has decided to devote the money to the promotion of industrial peace in the United States. He has appointed trustees to receive the money and ad minister the fund. The following statement governing the proposed disposition of the prize money, which is said to be tentative and subject to change as regards de tails, was made at the White House. "The amount of the Nobel prize will be conveyed by the president to the trustees, to be by them used as the foundation of a fund, the income of which shall be expended for bringing together in conference at Washington, especially during the sessions of con gress, representatives of labor and cap ital for the purpose of discussing in dustrial problems, with the view of arriving at a better understanding be tween employer and employe and thus promoting industrial peace. "The president, with their consent, will appoint as trustees of the fund the chief justice of the United States supreme court, the secretary of argi culture, the secretary of commerce and labor, a representative of labor and a representative of capital. The fund will be conveyed to the trustees to be used for the following purposes: "To invest and reinvest the princi pal of the fund, to receive any addi tions which may come to it by contri bution, and invest and reinvest them; to pay over the income from the fund and its additions to a comimttee of six, to be selected by the trustees, two to serve for one year, two for two years and two for three years; three of its members to be representatives of labor and three of capital, chosen for distinguished service in the in dustrial world for promoting righteous industrial peace, and to fill any vacan cies which may occur in this commit tee by selection and appointment in the same manner in which the com mittee is originally selected and ap pointed. "The committee of six, to be called the industrial peace committee, shall have charge of the annual and other conferences provided for under the terms of the foundation; shall re ceive suggestions for the subjects to be discussed; shall lead the discussion and publish the results of thee onfer ences. There shall be an annual con ference, and the committee of six shall be given authority to call special conferences in cases of great indus trial crises. The income paid to the committee by trustees shall be used for the expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties. It shall be provided in the terms of the trust that the president of the United States sbair- fill the vacancies which shall occur in the number of the trus tees." 

MESSAGE TO BE SHORT SAYS GOVERNOR HEAD Tacoma, Dec. 10.—Got. Mead ar rived in Tacoma late yesterday after noon with Chester Thome and S. A.

"We would like to have been able to spend more time," said the governor, but I must hasten back and get to work on my message to the legislature. While I have it blocked out in my mind, none of it is written yet, but it will be short. If I make it too long they will not read it. Departmental reports will give nearly all the infor mation wanted about state institu tions and I shall not repeat what they Bay." - | Citizenship for Porto RicaiM Washington, Dec 18.—President Roosevelt has sent to congress a mes sage on the subject of Porto Rioo. The principal recommendation is that Porto Rioans be given citizenship in the United States. I UNIFORM PURCHASING METHODS Keep CommiMion in Favor of Depart ment Supply Board. Washington, Dec. 13.—The commit tee on department methods, popularly known as the Keep commission, has submitted to the president its report on the standardization and method of purchase of department supplies. The report reviews at some length the pres ent unbusinesslike and needlessly ex pensive method of purchasing supplies by which each of the several depart ments in Washington uses its own standards of quality and makes its own purchases entirely independent of others. Briefly, the plan proposed by the committee is as follows: Provision is made by which the preparation of schedules, advertising for proposals and making equal the contracts for the purchase of depart ment supplies are places in the hands of a board to be known as the general supply committee, such board to be under the supervision and control of the secretary of commerce and labor, the head of each department or inde pendent btfrea'u to serve as a member of such board. The board thus con stituted is to purchase the department supplies heretofore acted upon by the board of award. The committee, however, nrakes ex ceptions in the casse of military and scientific departments of the govern ment. The military departments, it said, must obviously have their own methods of purchase under military organiaztion developed in time of peace so as to be capable of great ex pansion in time of war, and the scien tific departments, the committee thinks, should be allowed to purchase to a considerable extent their own sci entific apparatus and technical sup plies. ' 

SAYS STATE COMMISSION EXCEEDED ITS POWERS Walla Walla, Dec. B.—Judge Thom as H. Brents of the superior court, holds that the state railroad commis sion has exceeded its powers in order ing rates changed throughout the state where a complaint has not been made as required by the law governing the commission. If this decision is upheld it will have the effect of knocking out the rates ordered by the commission. The decision was made in overruling the demurrer made by the state to the complaint filed by the railroad compa nies in which they asked for a writ of review of the proceedings held in Wal la Walla June 20 last. The complaint was filed by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, the Great North; era, the Northern Pacific and the Washington and Columbia railways. The railway commission has ten days in which to file an answer in the case. Every effort will be made to have it adjudicated by the supreme court before the legislature meets, in order that if it is finaly decided that the law does not give the commission the power to fix new rates, this power may be added. BIG FINE ASSESSED Sugar Trust Sentenced to Pay $150,000 on Account of Rebates. New York, Deo. 12.—Fines aggre gating $150,000 were imposed yester day by Judge Holt in the United States circuit court upon the Ameri can Sugar Refining Company and the Brooklyn Cooperage company, after defendants through counsel had plead ed guilty to indictments charging the acceptance of rebates on sugar ship ments in violation of the Elkins anti rebat ng act. The sugar company was fined $80,000 and the cooperage com pany $70,000. After the fines were imposed United States Distriot Attorney Stimson, who conducted the prosecution, told the court that he thought the amount of the fine assessed was sufficiently large to act as a deterrent to rebaters in the future, and that the government would consent to the remainder of the indictments against the American Su gar Refining Company and the Brook lyn Cooperage Company being dis missed. Judge Holt granted a motion dis missing the other indictments. Against Government Aid Washington, Deo. 13.—President Roosevelt told Senator Penrose and a delegation of Pennsylvania^, who are interested in the Valdez-Yukon rail road project, that he did not favor government aid for railroads in Alaska, inasmuch as Gov. Hoggatt had report ed to him that such aid was unneces sary. Mr. Hoggatt's report was made at the instance of the president, who directed the governor last summer to make a special investigation of the railroad situation. The report says that private capital is already proceed ing to construct railways in Alaska and will be able to complete the work unassisted. Chinese Take Newchaag Newchwang, Dec B.—The Chinese authorities have taken charge of this city and the local residents are cele brating the event.

Car Shortage Invmtlf atkm Washington, Dec. B—The ear short age throughout the United States will be investigated by the interstate com zneroe commission.

GIVES OUT ROUTE OFFICIAL ANNOONGEHENT UK BT miWiBHE ROAD. New line to Be Approximately Two Thousand Miles in Length and Will Be Completed to Se attle January 1, 1909— Cross State Line Near Tekoa. Chicago, Dec 10.—The following official announcement was made Sat urday concerning the new route to be taken by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul railroad. The new line, it is estimated, will be 2,000 miles in length and it is expected that t will be completed as far as Butte, Mont., by January I, 1908, and that trains will be in operation over the entire line one year later, s Contracts have been let for the con struction work and track has been laid from Glenham, South Dakota, to a point about 20 miles west of the Mis souri river. The road will cross the Missouri river 12 miles west of Glen ham and then for about 40 miles fol lows the line of Oak Creek and its tributaries, and then parallesl the line between North and South Dakota for 50 miles. The state line between North Dakota and Montana will be crossed about eight miles west of the Little Missouri river. Four miles east of Terrey, Mont., the new road will cross the Northern Pacicfl by passing overhead. It is probable that division headquarters will be established at Miles City. Route From Butte West From Butte Westward the line fol lows the Deer Lodge, Hell Gate, Mis soula and St. Regis rivers to a point some four miles west of Saltese, Mont, where the ascent to the summit of the Bitter Root mountains will commence. The line follows the St. Joe river to within a few miles of its mouth [and crosses the Idaho-Washington line near Tekoa, Wash. The Columbia river will be crossed by a bridge of fifteen spans, having a total length of 2,750 feet. About 20 miles west of the Columbia river, a tunnel 3,400 feet in length will be constructed and another two miles in length will be built at Snoqualmie pass. At Maple Valley, Wash., con nection will be made with the Colum bia & Puget Sound railroad, over the tracks of which access will be obtained to Seattle. A new line will be con structed from Black River Junction to Tacoma ROUTE FROM THE ROCKIES Arrangements for Line to Portland are Kept Secret. Seattle, Deo. 10! —Chicago, Milwau kee & St. Paul officials here have giv en out an authoritative statement of their completed plans for building from Glenham, S. D., to Seattle. It is shown im this authorized statement that the Montana Railroad has been taken over by the Milwaukee line and will be radically revised, muoh curva ture and many grades being elimi nated. Like the former announcement of the line surveyed from Olenham to Butte, the official statement does not go beyond the route absolutely deter mined. Nothing is said of the projec tion to Portland, which has been in ferentially confirmed in previous an nouncements of high officials of the road. Nor is there anything in the report that confirms the report of an alliance with the Harriman system and a joint occupancy of tracks lead-i ing into Portland. President Earling on his last visit to Seattle absolutely refused to discuss the Portland exten sion, but he stated broadly that his line would tap all important places in the Northwest 

OFFICIAL CANVASS OF NOVEMBER ELECTION Olympia, Deo. B.— Official canvass of the retains of the laat general elec tion, announced from the office of Secretary of State Nioholf, shows a total of 114,747 votes were counted throughout the state of Washington. The Republican plurality, as compat- J ed from the congressional vote, was 40,686. In the general election of 1904, with the eoxitement of a nation al and state election the total vote was 14,5151, and the highest Republican plurality 73,442.

In 1904 the Socialists polled 10.0 M votes for president in this state. Howerer, they claim that that is not a fair comparison, as Debs received a large percentage of the votes of labor ing men who were not Socialists. The Socialist candidate for governor two yeartvigp received 7,420 votes, and in addition 1,070 votes were cast for the Socialist-Labor candidate for governor, by which comparison a marked in oreaae in the Socialist vote of the state is shown.

BRYAN'S COMMENT ON PRESIDENT'S MESSWE Lincoln, Neb Dec. 8.-Co mmen t. ing on President Roosevelt's messaee William Jennings Bryan says there is much that is good and much that is bad in it, but it may be regarded as the president's most important state paper. Mr. Bryan says: "The message contains much that is Democratic and for which the general public may well thank him. it con tains some things that ought to arouse severe criticism. "The president boldly appropriates some doctrines which the Democrats ha?e been advocating, but on the other hand, he announces doctrines which are so absurd as to create amusement if the suggestions came from a less prominent source. "In some oases he takes advanced ground; in some oases he retreats from ground already taken." Mr. Bryan complains that what the president says on the subject of gov ernment injunction will not be satis factory to the laboring man or to those who respect the right of trial by jury. The president's stand on child labor is commended, as is also the position he takes on the eight hoar law and the right of the people to criticize a judge. Deplores Warlike Attitude Finally Mr. Bryan deplores what he calls the president's warlike atti tude, fie says in conclusion: "There will be general disappoint-' ment at the warlike tone of his mes sage, where he discusses the army and navy. He speaks of the na?y as the surest guaranty of peace which the country possesses. Shame upon the chief executive, that he should place an instrument of brute force above the nation's sense of justice as a guar antor of peace. "The best guarantor of peace is onr nation's purpose to deal jnstly with other nations. War ought to be a last resort, not a first consideration. It is bad enough to have a few profes sional soldiers. It is not necessary that the whole nation shall be keyed up all the time to the fighting point"
