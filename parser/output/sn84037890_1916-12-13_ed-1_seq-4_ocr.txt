The results obtained by the Exec utive Committees of the American Society of Equity nnd the Farmers Co-operative Tobacco Association In effecting the recent sales of tobacco in the Green Ulver country should be, and doubtless are, very encourag ing to the growers of the weed la this section. For many years the price paid for tobacco has been so far below the real cost of production that it has been a real burden and no one would have grown It except for the rrnson that it was certain ready money at a season of the year when most needed, at some price. We Join the producers In rejoicing that they have been relieved of this burden by means of co-operation. Then, better prices means greater effort as well as an Improved prod uct, nnd this assures larger returns. It necessarily follows that more money will be put into circulation throughout the tobacco belt, helping the farmer to meet his obligations, which in turn benefits every other lino of business. Truly the farmer, the backbone of commerce. Is fast coming Into h!3 own. We are glad that it Is thus. The Federal Land Banks being es tablished and ready to loan money under the Rural Credit Act. now is tlio time for the farmers who wish to borrow to form their local asso ciations. Ten farmers can organize sin association in any neighborhood. Full particulars regarding the act may bo had by writing to the Feder al Farm Loan Board, Washington, II. C. The farmers should avail themselves t this opportunity and equip their farm with the proper machinery, erect the necessary bul!ding3 for housing his products, and put their farms on a round bus iness basis. The State a'ld Oovc-rn-liienl agents for the farmer's aid. Pie prepared to furnish all kinds of Information relative to both the farm and tho markets. Thn farm is n factory and when Ms products ate produced and sold according to care fully planned business methods its returns will compar" favorably with other successful business enterpris es. There is a new .ra dawning for the farmer and tho progressive man will surely forge ahead. Mr. Farm er lets keep abreast of the times In Ohio county. The annual report of Secretary of the Interior Lane, which has just boon made public, shows that twenty million acres of land were claimed by private owners during the fiscal year ending with Juno 30th, as against seventeen millions for each of the preceding two years and a still smaller average for previous j ears. The greater portion of tho 2."0,000,000 acres of public lands still left in Uncle Sam's domain io in the arid region. However tho Re c'?.",nt,on Service carried on con struction work on twenty-four Irri gation projects, completing ten and adding .",000 farms to territory for which irrigation water Is available. Irrigation water Is actually going now to nearly 20,000 farms. Where properly Irrigated It Is said this land ig very productive. The mid-winter meeting of the Kentucky Press Association will bo held In Louisville, December 28-23, with headquarters at the Seelbach Hotel. Business and pleasure will bo the order of tho day wit.h the craft. I'lease excuse us from riding on t'ncle Sam's Alaskan train espec ially the one where tho wheels freeze to tho rails during the ten minutes icicles, as large as a barrel, are be ing cut from a tunnel. Tho National nlr, "Star Spangled Uannor" may soon be changed to "How Dry I Am." Let It go at that. Tho Teutons are fast coming Into what they did not own. Till: TEST OF CARRAN.A. The Now Vork World very wisely says: In the protocol signed by tho Mexican-American Joint Commission tho United States Imposes no huisli con ditions upon Mexico. In no way dim it threaten to trespass upon tlio rights of Mexico or reflect upon tho honor nnd dignity of tho iritlon. Its purpose is solely. In u holpful spirit, to effect a working arrangemiit that shall bring speidlly to an end a sit uation satisfactory nelthor to Mexico nor the lnJt"d States. To further that result It offers to make confes sions that should convince tho most scns'tlvo Latin-American of the sir cerity or Its policy. At the same time Mexico must meet its responsi bilities and discharge its duties In good faith toward Its own people and foreigners. Tho agreement reached by tho Joint commissioners will servo as a test of Carranza's Intelligence' and fitness to direct the affairs of his country, Ho personally has been tho one great stumbling block to nn earlier adjustment of the relations of tho two nations. His attitude in the past has been to crcato difficul ties, on points of punctllllo, where a cicar-signicd, pracucni-iuinucu statesman would have driven straight at a definite settlement nd- vantngeous to the nation's cause, which he lg charged with upholding. The prompt approval of the proto col by Carranzn will not only clear tho nlr. but it will strengthen gen oral confidence in his capacity to rehabilitate Mexico. Investigate Chicago and Elgin. The Elgin Board of Trade Is tho only exchange In the world that does not at least go through the motions of buying and selling on a largo scale. Enormous transactions arc necessary to establish prices for stocks and bonds in New Vork and for grain and provisions in Chicago. In Elgin, however, three men meet once a week and, following a sale of twenty-five tubs of butter, effect ed at a figure between bid nnd ask ed prices on the part usually of not more than two traders, a "market" is made which becomes basic for dairy products throughout the world. Several jears ago, when the Elgin clique was even less ceremonious in its price-fixing, a United States court issued an injunction forbid ding practices of every kind not based upon bona'-llde transfers of ac tual commodities. It is held that the grotesque little performance now staged every seven .days meets all tho requirements of the law. As suming tint this view is correct, the fact remains that what consumers everywhere pay for butter is deter mined to a large t'-ctent by a Board of Trade which Is not a board of trade, which arbitrarily puts its prices upon high-grade butter and thus assists in the sale at extortion ate rates of millions of pounds in ferior it quality. Judicial proceedings having fail ed to reach the root of the evil at Elgin, as at Chlcairn, It is to Con gress that the people must look for a remedy. Publicity i3 not relished by either of these manipulated mar kets. Investigation properly direct ed will exercise a powerful restraint upon wrong-doing and open a way to suitable legislation. New York World. St like Decided Upon. New York, Dec. 10. Officials of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America announced tonight that a strike of CO, 000 makers of men's and children's clothing in this city, Newark and RIdgewood, N. J., will bo called Tuesday or Wednesday. The committee of eight In charge of the strike lias decided on the hour and the day It was said, but these details have been kept secret. It also is planned to carry tho strike to Philadelphia If manufac turers there attempt to make cloth ing for New York shops affected by the strike. At a meeting late today It was stated about 8,000 men and women In Newark had promised to join the New York strikers. Union leaders asserted tonight that tho strike would last not more than two days.. Ohioau Killed By Train. Elizabethtown, Ky., Dec. 8. Howard McMahon, of Ironton, Ohio, was run over and killed by an Illi nois Central train near Ceclllan to day. Tho body was cut in two. Three men are being held on sus picion that they throw McMahon from tho train. A flood Revival. The writer assisted pastor Rev. J. A.

SAYS SPOTLIGHT PISTOL WILL DECREASE CRIME A pistol which throws a spotlight and sends a bullet into the spit is tlie invention of P. F. Krusc, of Lou isville. Mr. Krusc only after ten jeers' effoit has perfected t'10 inven tion, which he claims will eliminate duels between officers and law breakers and greatly lessen the an nual number of homicides in the country. The invention in reality is not a pistol, but a searchlight which can bo clamped on to tho barrel of any pistol. It consists of a small bat toy, but powerful; a tube, in which is an electric bulb, resting at right angles to the revolver barrel .and connected with another tube run ning alongside tho revolver barrel Through the later tubo the light is deflected by a mirror. Clamps make the lighting attachment ad justable to any pistol. Tho lover by which the light Is operated Is near tho revolver trigger. With the same finger one throws on tlio light and pulls tho trigger. With the search light tho attacking party presum ably a burglar Is located, and If he does not immediately surrender a bullet can bo sent into his heart with deadly aim. Mr. Kruso has applied for a pat ent on his Invention and Intends to begin tho manufacture of thcin In Louisville. Fig; Leaves Not hi Evidence. Two girls in a street car wero in animated conversation.

Declares That Their Opera tion Should Not Be Stopped or Interrupted by the Con certed Action of Organized Bodies of Men Until a Pub lic Investigation Shall Have Been Instituted. I N one of the shortest messages ever sent to congress President Wilson urges that early nctlon be taken to complete his pro gram of "settlement nnd regulation" recommended nt the Inst session. The message In full Is ns follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time tho dnty laid upon ma by the constitution of communicating to you from time to time Information of the stnte of the Union, and recommending to your con sideration such legislative measures as may be Judged necessary apd expedi ent I shall continue the practice, which I hope has been acceptable to yon, of leaving to tho reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine my self to those matters of more general public policy with which It seems nec essary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act nt this session and shall make my sug gestions ns few as possible. But there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time (o complete and which It seems necessary In the Interest of the public to do at once. The Railroad Problem. . In the llrst place, It seems to me Im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration nnd action should be accorded the remaining mc.'isutes of the program of settlement and regulation which I had occasion to ro'-oinmond to yon nt the close of your last session In view' of the public dan gers disclosed by the unaccommodated dllllcultlos which then existed and which still unhappily continue to ex ist between the railroads of the coun try nnd their locomotive engineers, conductors nnd trainmen. I then recommended: First, immediate provision for tho enlargement and administrative reor ganization of tho interstate commerce commission slung the lines embodied In the bill recently passed by the house of representatives and now awaiting, action by the senate In order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various du ties now devolving upon it with a promptness and thoroughness which are, with its present constitution nnd means of action, practically impossible Second, the establishment of an eight hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wnges In the employment of all railway employees who are ac tually engaged In tho work of operat ing trains In interstate transportation. Third, tho authorization of tho ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe tho nctual re sults In experience of tho adoption of tho eight hour day In railway transpor tation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by tho con gress of the consideration by tho In terstate commerce commission of nil Increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures hy tlio rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by the adoption of tho eight hour day and which have not been off set by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed Justify the Increase. Fifth, nn amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation nnd arbitration of such controversies us the present by adding to It a provision that, In case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fall, a full public Investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted nnd completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. Control by the Executive. And, sixth, tho lodgment lu the hands of the executive of the power, In case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railways of tho coun try as may bo required for mllltnry uso and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft Into tho military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative olllchils as tho circumstances requite for their safe and clllclent use. Tho second and third of these rec ommendations tho congress Immediate ly acted on: It established tho eight hour day as the legal basis of work and wages In trulu service ami It au thorized tlio appointment of a commis sion to observe and report upon tho practical result, deeming thesu the measures most Immediately needed, but it Mtpoucd action upon the other aug gestlons until au opportunity should bo offered for u mora deliberate consider- anon ui num. The fourth recommendation I do not deem it no-jessary to rwiew. The pow-, t: q 

OPERATION OF RAILWAYS SHALL" NOT BE 8TOPPED To pass a law which forbade or prevented tho Individual work man to leave his work beforo re ceiving tho approval of society in doing so would be to adopt a new principle into our jurispru dence which I take it for grant ed we are not prepared to intro duce. But tho proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by the concerted ac tion of organized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make tho whole question at Is sue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation Is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the concerted ac tion of powerful bodies of men shall not bo permitted to stop the industrial processes of the na tion. I cr of tlio Interstate commerce commis sion to grant an increase of rates on the ground referred to Is indisputably clear, and a recommendation by tho congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw lu question the scope of the commission's authority or Its Inclination to do justice when there is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions the Increase In the interstate commerce commis sion's membership nnd In Its facilities tor performing Its manifold duties, the provision for full public Investigation and assessment of Industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive" of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly icnew. New Legislation Necessary. Iho necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing. Those who Imve Intrusted us with the respoiislbllltv and duty of servlnir ami s..irr..Mi.n.,iii,.. I them in such matters would lind If hard, I believe, to excuse n failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of nctlon. Not only does tho Interstate com merce commission now find It practical ly impossible, with Its present member ship .and organization, to perform Its greatVfiinetions promptly and thorough ly, but It Is not unlikely that It may presently be found advisable to add to Its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first bo perfected as nn administrative Instrument. The country cannot nnd should not consent to remain any longer 'exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbi tration and conciliation which the con gress can easily nnd promptly supply. And all will agree that thero must bo no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make Immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they nre needed and whenever they are needed. Tills Is a program of regulation, pre vention nnd ndmlnlstratlvo efficiency which nrgues its own ense In the mere statement of It. With regard to one of Its Items tho increase in tho etllclency of the Interstate commerce commission, the house of representatives has al ready acted. Its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. To Safeguard Industrial Processes. I would hesitate to recommend, nnd I daro say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should 1 make It, that any mini In any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue in nn employment which ho de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or pre vented tho Individual workman to leave his work before receiving tho approval of society In doing so would bo to adopt a new principle Into our Juris prudence which I tnko It for grauted we are not prepared to Introduce. But the proposal that tho operation of the railways of tho country shall not bo stopped or Interrupted by tho concert,-, ed action of organized bodies of men until a public Investigation shall have been Instituted which shall make the whole question at Issue plain for tho Judgment of the opinion of the nation Is not to proiio.se nuy such principle. It Is based upon the very different principle that tho concerted action of powerful In Miles of uieu shall not be permitted to stop tho industrial pro cesses of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportu nity to acquaint Itself with the merits of the caso as between employee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to consider ull practi cable means of conciliation or arbitra tion. I can see nothing In that proposition but tho Justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of tho ih-ccssnry processes of its very life. Thero is nothing arbitrary or unjust lu It unless It bo arbitrarily und unjustly done. It can and should be douo with a full and scrupulous ro Kurd for the Interests and liberties of all concerned as well as for tho per manent Interests of society Itself. Threo matters of capital importance await tho nation of the senate which have already been acted upon by the bouse of representatives tho bill which ecks to eitcnd greater freedom of combination to those engaged lu pro Urges the Passage of the Corrupt Practices Act Reg ulating the Expenditure of Money In Elections and Fa vors More Freedom of Com bination to Those Engaged In Foreign Commerce. motlng tho foreign commerce- of the country than Is now thought by soma to be legal under the terms of tho laws against monopoly the-bill amend ing tho present organic law of Porto Rico nnd the bill proposing n more thorough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money In elections, commonly called the corrupt practice act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted' Into law. Their urgency lies In the manifest cir cumstances which render their adop tion nt this time not only opportune but neeessnry. Even delay would se riously Jeopard the Interests of the country and of the government. Immediate pnssage of the bill to reg ulate the expenditure of money ln elections may seem to be less neces sary thnn the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer, because at least two years will elapse before another election In which fed eral olllces are to bo tilled, but It would greatly relievo tho public mind If thM important matter wero dealt with while the circumstances nnd tho dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and speeding campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied In the light of present expeilence. And a delav would imve the further serHtm disadvantage of postponing action un til another election was at hand mid some special object connected with It "ll"'lt ,,p thought to be In the mh:d of ""'se "o urged it. Action ran lie taken now with facts for guidance und without suspleion or partisan purpose. Enlarging Our Export Trade. I shall not argue nt length the de slrabillty of giving a freer hand In the, matter of combined nnd concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake tho essential enterpilso of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume. k : a. 

REGULATE EXPENDITURE OF ELECTION MONEY Immediate passage of the bill to regulate tho expenditure of money in elections may seem to Jt be less necessary than the imme diate enactment of the other measures to whloh I refer, be cause at least two years will elapse beforo another election in' which federal offices are to be' filled, but it would greatly relieve the public mind If this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dangers to the publio morals of the present method of obtaining and spend ing campaign funds stand cloar under recent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience. 0- -Ct- has Indeed already assumed, a magnl tudo unprecedented In our experience. We have not tho necessary Instrumen talities for Its prosecution. It Is deem ed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequato scale un der our present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted Inw for It which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The tiling must be done now. becnuso the opportunity Is hero nnd may escape us if we hesi tate or delay. The argument for tho proposed nmendments of the organic law of Porto Rico Is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the Island anil regulating tho rights and privileges of Its peoplo are not Just. Wo havo cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which wo havo not satisfied. There Is uneasiness among tho people? of the Island nnd even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which tho adoption of tho pending measure would happily remove. Wo do not doubt what wo wish to do In any essential particular.-. Wo ought to do It at once. Legislative Annalt Enriched. There are other matters already ad vanced to tho stngo of conference be tween tho two houses of which It Is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreemtju concerning them will no jdtful---" round aim action taseu upon tueu Inasmuch as this Is, at-ntlemciij ably the last occasion I shall b1 address the Sixty-fourth eongres hope that you will permit me to say with what gciiulno plensuro and satis faction 1 have co-operated with you in the many measures of constructive policy with which you havo enriched the legislative annals of tho country. It has been a prlvllego to labor In such company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare lervlccablensM and tlstluctlon.
