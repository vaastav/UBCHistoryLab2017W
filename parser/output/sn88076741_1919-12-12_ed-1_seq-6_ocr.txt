Washington, Dec. 3.—President Wil son's annual message to congress for the opening of the new session which began this week was transmitted by messenger to each of the two houses, wtyere It was read yesterday afternoon. The test of the message follows: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives I sincerely regret that I cannot be present at the opening of this session of the congress. I am thus prevented from presenting In as direct a way as I could wish the many questions that are pressing for solution at this time. Happily, I have had the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments who have kept in close touch with affairs in their de tail and whose thoughtful recommend ations I earnestly second. In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs grow ing out of federal control, I shall take the liberty at a later day of addressing 70U. Recommends Budget System. I hope that congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation looking to the establishment of a bud jet system. That there should be one •ingle authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made, not in dependently of each other, but with one single comprehensive plan of ex penditure properly related to the nation's income, there can be no doubt. I believe the burden of preparing the budget must, in the nature of the case, If#the work is to be properly done and responsibility concentrated instead of divided, rest upon the executive. The budget so prepared should be submit ted to and approved or amended by a single committee of each house of congress and no single appropriation should be made by the congress, ex cept such as may have been included In the budget prepared by the execu tive o. vlded by the particular com mittee of congress charged with the budget legislation. Check on Expenditures. Another and not less important aspect of the problem is the ascertain ment of the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated are expended. Under existing laws the .only audit is for the purpose of ascertaining whether expenditures have been lawfully made within the appro priations. No one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely, economi cally and effectively. The auditors should be highly trained officials with permanent tenure In the treasury de partment, free of obligations to, or motive of consideration for this or any subsequent administration and author ized and empowered to examine into and :make report upon the methods em ployed and the results obtained by the executive departments of the govern ment. Their reports should be made to die congress and to the secretary of the treasury. Simplifying Taxation Methods. I trust that congress will give imme diate consideration to the problem of futqre taxation. Simplification of the income and profit taxes has become an Immediate necessity. These taxes per formed Indispensable service during •he war. They must, however, be simplified, not only to save the tax payer Inconvenience and expense, but order that his liability may be made and definite. reference to the details of the revenue law, the secretary of the: treasury and the commissioner of in tempi revenue will lay before you for you* consideration certain amendments necessary or. desirable in connection wltlf the administration of the Jaw recommendations which have my ap preijal and support ... No Change Befora 1$21 It wis of the utmost importance that I* dealing with this matter the present law should not be disturbed so far as "efafijla^taxes for thecaleadar year 2820, payable in the calendar year IftHL The congress-mightwellcon sider whetberthe higher xates of in come profit 'taxes. can in peace times be effertively product!ve of reve .Whefhfe they may ridt, on the h' be5/destructive of badness and ^productive of waste and point .at jfaicb times'high rates of' Income, •fitiwes. discourage energy, re jjggepttvft'to new enterprise, n. extravagant expenditures, nee tadnstrial*tagnatlon with aitf-«tber a KB','!? leal'' Mai-. believers In tariff fdr-revenue ool# must be subordinated to the atafHt**? ic in tercet in the light of utterly ~ch*ilfr*t condition* BeforethewarAmeri^ the debtor, of the rest the world and the interest payments' site bad,, to ia tp foreign countries oaAmerlcanse? cttrities held abroad* tiio expenditures of.

On the other hand, she has purchased a large' proportion of the American securities previously held abroad, has loaned somi ten billion to foreign governments anj has built her own ships. Our favorable balance, of trade has thus been greatly Increased and Europe has been deprived of the means of meeting it heretofore exist ing. Europe can have'only three ways of meeting the favorable balance of trade in peace times: by imports.into this country of gold or of goods, or by establishing new crefflts. 'Europe is in no position at the present time to ship gold to us nor could 'we con template further importation of gold into the country without concern. Tariff Legislation. The time has nearly passed for in ternational governmental loans and it will take time to develop in this coun try a market for foreign securities. Anything, therefore, which would tend to prevent foreign countries from settling for our exports by shipments of goods into this country could only have the effect of preventing them from paying for our exports and there fore of preventing the exports being made. The productivity of the country greatly stimulated by the war must find an outlet by exports to foreign countries and any measures taken to prevent Imports will inevitably curtail exports, force curtailment of produc tion, load the banking machinery of the country with credits to carry un sold products and produce industrial stagnation and unemployment. If we want to sell we must be prepared to buy. Whatever, therefore, may have been our views during the period of growth of American business concern ing tariff .legislation, we must now adjust our own economic life to a changed condition growing out of the fact that American business is full grown and that America is the great est capitalist In the world. New Policies Required. No policy of isolation will satisfy the growing needs and opportunities of America. The provincial standards and policies of the past, which have held American business as if in a straightjacket, must yield and give way to the needs and exigencies of the new day in which we live—a day full of hope and promise for American business, if we will but take advantage of the opportunities that ere ours for the asking. The recent war has ended our isolation and throws upon us a great duty and responsibility. The United States must share the expand ing world market. To Assist Returned Soldiers. There is one immediate and very practical question resulting from the war which we should meet in the most liberal spirit. It is a matter of recog nition and relief to our soldiers. I can do no better than quote from my last message urging this very action: "We must see to it that our return ing soldiers are assisted in .every prac ticable way to lind the places for which they are fitted in the daily work of the country. Th{s can be done by developing and maintaining upon an adequate scale the admirable organiza tion created by the department of labor for placing men seeking work and it can also be done, in at least one very great field, by creating new opportuni ties for individual enterprise. The secretary of the interior has pointed out the way by which returning sol diers may be helped to find and take up the land in the hitherto undeveloped regions of the country which the fed eral government has already prepared or can readily prepare for cultivation and also on many of the cut over or neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older states and I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently tljf t'hls plans shall re vive the immediate and substantial support ,ofcthe congress." Developing Chemical Industries. In the matter,,# tariff legislation, beg tocall your attention to the state ments contained in my lqgt message urging legislation with reference t6 the establishment of the chemical and dye stuffs Industry in America: "Our complete dependence upon Ger man ftipplies before the war .made ttib interruption of trade a caii&Cf £&e$ tionaj. disturbance.

Ictf passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal cOnditigjii*, this unrest will rapidly disappear Tw the meantime, It does much evit "jit seems to me that In dealing with situation congress^ should not be patient pr drastic but should see) rather to remove the causes. It should endeavor to bring our country bifek speedily to a peace basis, with amelior ated living conditions under the mini-* mum of restrictions upon personid liberty that Is consistent with our re construction problem. And it should arm the federal government With power to deal In Its criminal courts with those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time tested Institutions. No Lenience to Insurrectionists. With the free expression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly political change, however fundamental, there must be no interference, but to ward passion and malevolence tending to Incite crime and Insurrection under guise of political evolution there should be no leniency In this direct connection I would call your attention to my recommendations on August 8, pointing out legislative measures which would be effective In controlling and bringing down the* present cost of liv ing, which contributes so largely to this unrest. On only one of these recommendations has the congress acted. If the government's campaign is to be effective it is necessary that the other steps suggested be acted on at once. Would Extend Food Control. I renew and strongly urge the neces sity of the extension of the present food control act as to the period of time in which It shall, remain in opera tion. During this period the congress will have an opportunity to make similar permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for interstate commerce and to exclude them from Intertsate shipment If the requirements of the law are not com plied with. v. Regulating Cold Storage. I also renew my recommendation that the congress pass a law regulat ing cold storage as It Is regulated, for example, by the laws of the state of New Jersey, which limits the time dur ing which goods may be kept in stor age, prescribes the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period and requires that goods re leased from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt. It would materially add to the service ability of the law If it were also pre scribed that all goods released from storage for Interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each pack age th& selling or market price at which they went Into storage. I would also renew my recommenda tion that all goods destined for Inter state commerce should in every case, where their form or package makes It possible, be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of ti»e producer. «. We should formulate a law requiring a federal license of all corporations engaged in interstate commerce 'and embodying in the license specific regu lations designed to secure competitive, selling and prevent unconscionable' profits In the methods of marketing. No one who has observed the mprch of events in the last year can .fail to note the absolute need of a definite program to bring about an lmprbvre went in the conditions of .labor.

The establishment of the principles regarding labor laid down in the cov enant of the league of nations offers us the way to Industrial peace and conciliation. No other road lies open to us.

Europe Itself, whence has comef the unrest which now hold the world at bay, Is an example of standpattsnr In these vital human matters which America might well accept as an ex« ample not to be followed but studi ously to be avoided. Labor not only is entitled to an ade quate wage, but capital should receive a reasonable return upon Its invest* ment and is entitled to protection, at the hands of the government in every emergency. No government worthy of the name can "play" these element* against each other. The right of individuals to strike If inviolate and ought not to be inter fered with by any process of govern ment, but there Is a predominant rlghi and that Is the right of the government to protect all of Its people and to assert Its power and, majesty against the challenge of any class. Arbitration Tribunal Advised. I In the matter of International dis putes which have led to war, states* men have sought to set up as a remedy, arbitration for war. Does this not point the way fOr the settlement of industrljal disputes? Certainly human intelligence can dOvIse some acceptable tribunal for adjusting tie differences between capital and labor. This Is the hour of test and trial for America. Let not her influence as a mediator between capital and labor be weakened and her own failure to settle matters of purely domestic concern be .pro claimed to: the. world. Minorities Muit Nof Rule. There are. those In this country Who threaten, direct action to torce their will upon a majority.
