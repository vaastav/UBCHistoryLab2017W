Republican National Platform. fTou) Vote t(W Bends Whatever may have been the merits or demerit of the proposition sub mitted to the city by the American Light and Power company for building a aawer system, all discussion Is temporarily out of order, since the council at special session last evening, rescinded its previous action, setting aside Its Agreement to give the contract to the above company. This now leaves the matter open to all bidders and should vanish every opposition to the building of a sewer system In this dty and the voting of bonds for that purpose. Much opposition, it must be admitted, was aroused when It became known that the council expected to exclude other bidders and it is doubtful If a bond Issue would have been voted, under the circumstances, despite the applanations made by Mayor Lester and others, eminently above suspicion of elf-Interest In such matters. Now, however, the bone of contention is removed and it Is up to the people. The question of issuing sewer bonds to the extent of $290,000 will come before the citizens of Albuquerque for approval or rejection on January 19th, 1909, and it is unquestionably the duty of every one who has the best inter ests of the city and of public health at heart to vote for the bonds. The council, by resolution last night, declared that if the bonds were voted, it would call for bids in lump sum and also on a percentage basis and let the contract to the lowest bidder. This is eminently fair and does away -with criticism. It is needless to dilate upon the necessity for properly equipping this city rlth a sewer system. Every resident of Albuquerque knows the need of such avn Improvement with the least possible delay, fcvery property owner knows Ilia increased value that would come to real estate with the completion of an adequate sewer system. While there are many who have plans to suggest as to tho building of a sewer, there is no one who can advance a reason for not building a eewer. The first step toward securing the sewerage system is to vote the bonds. "We know what the sewer will cost at a maximum because the city is In pus Maaion of the plans and specifications of its engineers, fixing the amount. Therefor, a bond issue of $290,000 will cover this estimated expense and if there is a surplus by r-ason of a lower bid, the balance will remain In pos session of the city. The people should devote their attention now, towards securing the bond tasue and then the question of letting the contract can be taken up in due time and a sewerage system constructed without delay. Vote for. the bonds and help make greater Albuqurque. The following from the Indianapolis News might well be applied to New Mexico: The killing of an eagle Is in reported. Iaglea are bcomlng rare in this part of the country. The eagle is our national bird. Why any one should wish to destroy a living emblem is past finding out and yet whenever a man with a gun can get a shot at an eagle he never falls to fire. His next step particularly if his aim has been good, is to tell the newspapers of his wonderful feat. The dimensions of the bird "from tip to tip" of wings are re ported and the hunter is much puffed up with pride. If there is anything In aantiment it would seem that it ought to extend to the American eagle; but instead of protecting It the American people seem to be determlnd to exterml ate It. A few more years and it will be classed with the great auk and tmiAn only in the books. A is usually the case, the people of Venezuela who pay the taxes are the nes who will now suffer. Castro escaped from the country with the funds f the treasury and Holland has besieged the coast. Some day the people will learn enough to go out and hang rascals like any other criminals, but until taey do, courts of justice as demonstrated in South America will be merely tools for conspiring villlans.
