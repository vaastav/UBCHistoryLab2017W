The JEsris and Intelligencer. FREDERICK W. BAKER, Editor. M gib has a more extended circulation mong the intelligent farmers and business men of Harford than any other paper in the county. Tho attention of advertisers is directed to this fact. B B It AIK, Md. Friday Morning, Dec. 8, 1882 The President's Message. The message of President Arthur, which was transmitted to Congress on Monday, gives abundant evidence that the verdiet of the people at-the November elections, in favor of a reduction of taxation, has lieen wisely heeded. It remains to he seen wheth er Congress, which is still under tlie control of tho Republicans, will grant the relief the people so urgently demand. Tho President, in the first place, refers to the friendly character of our intercourse with foreign nations, and to the prospect of an early adjustment of our difficulties with England growing out of the arrest of citizens of the United States in Ireland. Tho main features of the message relate to our domestic concerns and the interesting and important subjects of a revision of the tariff and the reduction of internal revenue taxation are treated at length. Tho President heartily approves of the recommendation of tlie Secretary of tho Treasury for immediate ami extensive reduc tions of tho revenues of the govern ment, which amount annually to $155,000,000 more Ilian is needed for the current expenses of tlie government and tlie interest on the national debt. Although this surplus lias been largely applied to the payment of the national debt, the President renews tho conviction that such rapid extinguishment of tlie national indebtedness as is now taking place is cause for serious apprehension, rather than for congratulation. If tlie swollen revenues of the government lie idle in tlie treasury they will become the temptation to corrupt and extravagant expenditure. Tlie President, therefore, suggests that unless it shall be found that tlie probable expenditures of the government for the coming year have been under-estimated, all internal taxes except those which relate to distilled spirits, can be prudently abrogated. This would diminish the cost of collection $2,500,000, and retire from office from 1,500 to 2,000 persons. He does not think, however, that the time has arrived for the total abolition of internal revenue taxes, for the reason that it is doubtful whether the duties on imports would alone lie sufficient for the needs of government, and because, moreover, a total abolition of excise taxes would prove a serious obstacle to a thorough revision of Hie tariff. The present tariff system is, the President frankly admits, in many respects unjust, and if the tax on domestic spirits is to ho retained, he is clearly of the opinion, judging from the revenues derived from customs during tlie last few years, that large reductions in the customs revenue arc entirely feasible; and this may be accomplished, lie believes, with out abandoning the protection of domestic labor by equalizing the public burdens among all classes and occupations. Referring to his veto of the River and Har bor bill, tho President recommends the ad visability of the passage of an amendment to tlie Federal Constitution which would permit the executive to disapprove of any item or items in an appropriation hill without Doing under the necessity of condemning the entire measure. Congress is invited to make more adequate provision for arming and equipping the mi litia. The condition of the navy is comment ed upon, and the attention of Congress is called to the intimate connection and inter dependence of the navy and tho commercial marine, and to the decadence of our com merce, which has been transferred to foreign vessels. The surplus in the Postofllcc department leads tho President to favor n reduction of letter postage to two cents per half ounce, and ho believes that in three or four years tlie increase of revenues consequent upon a reduction of rates would equal the expendi tures. President Arthur expresses the determina tion of the administration to push the star route cases, and says that “if any guilty per sons shall finally escape punishment it will not he for lack of earnest and diligent efforts on the part of the prosecution.” Commenting in connection with the report of the Secretary of the Interior upon the il literacy disclosed in certain portions of the country by the census returns, the President thinks it a momentous question whether Congress should net extend immediate ami substantial aid to supplement individual effort and State legislation in behalf of edu cation. Upon the subject of civil service reform the President recalls the sentiments express ed in his last communication to Congress, and adds that since these suggestions were submitted “the people of the country, appa rently without distinction of party, have in various ways given expressions of their earnest wish for prompt and definite action. In my judgment such action should no longer he postponed.” The President takes occasion to set himself right upon the question of official removals, and claims that in the fourteen months of his administration only eighty-nine removals have been made, exactly the same number made in the four months of President Gar field’s administration. In connection with tliis subject he also expresses his disapproval of forced contributions from office-holders, and favors their prohibition by law. —ln the Criminal Court of Baltimore city, last Friday, Judge Phelps sentenced Charles Foote, colored, to ho whipped witli seven lashes and to be confined sixty days in jail for brutally assaulting and beating bis wife. The lashes were promptly administered.— The prisoner’s counsel, Mr. T. Kell Bradford, intends to sue out a writ of error to the Court of Appeals. It is difficult lo sec what relief the Court of Appeals can give. The fellow lias received his lashing and before the case can be reviewed lie will have served out his sentence of imprisonment. This is tlie first instance, wo believe, in which a wife beatcr lias been sent to tlie whipping post under tho law of 1882. —Commissioner of Internal Revenue Raum informs Collector Ditty that the practice of slapping spirits concealed in other packages to local option counties is not permissible under the revenue laws, which require that packages must not be encased, hut must be open, so as to show marks, brands and stamps. —The total amount allowed for the ex penses of President Garfield’s illness ami funeral, is $•‘18,800.0.1. Of this the physicians will receive $27,500, ns follows: Dr. Bliss, $0,500; Dr. Agncw, $5,000; Dr. Hamilton, $5,000; Dr. Reyburn, $4,000; Dr. Boynton, *4,000; Dr. Susan A. Edson, 

SI,OOO. I’lans of the Democrats. Tlie Republicans in Congress, it appears, depend upon two things to turn the tide of Democratic success and restore to them the confidence of the jieople, namely, a reduction of taxation iiy I lie Congress now in session and blunders by the Democratic leaders. We believe they will lie disappointed in Hie re sult of the first and not lie gratified on tbe second point. Tbe Democrats in Congress will heartily co operate with the lit publicans in all just and equitable measures looking to wards reducing the burdens of taxation, and will lie equally entitled with them to any credit that may attach thereto. In the second place tbe Democrats do not intend to blunder, although pitfalls will doubtless be spread in their path by their opponents. The plans of tbe Democrats are outlined in the Wash ington correspondence of tbe Baltimore Sun< as follows: Senator (ionnan, of Maryland, and ex Speaker Randall were in consultation to day regarding the line of action to be followed by the Demo cratic party in Congress during the present ses sion. Senator (ionnan says it is proposed to hold a joint caucus of Democratic Senators ami Representatives at an early day, when a definite programme will be laid out. Ho thinks the Democratic party will proceed with delibera tion and caution in all matters of general legis lation. He says they will advocate a reduction of the internal revenue taxes, probably abolish the tax on everything but whisky ami tobacco, and advocate a reduction of the force now em ployed under the direction of (lie Internal reve nue bureau. Senator Groomc said that lie was in favor of taking off taxes as soon as possible, and would assist in any proper measures to that effect which were brought forward at this session.— He thought it would lie wise to get all the re duction practicable at this session, and then if the treasury would stand it, when the next Con gress came together the taxes could be still fur ther reduced. Representative Talbott concurs in tlie views of Senator Gorman and adds that the Democratic party in Congress will endeavor to lay a firm foundation for future success by advocating such measures as will serve the best interests of the people and relieve them as far as possible from burdensome taxation. ——#•< Reassembling of Congress. —Tlie second session of tbe 47th Congress was opened at Washington on Monday. In the Senate business was immediately commenced, the President’s message was read and tlie death of Senator Hill, of Georgia, feelingly announc ed by bis colleague, Senator Brown. In the House several new members were sworn in and leave granted to introduce a number of new bills. Tbe titles of these show that some of tbe Republican members, at least, arc dis posed to yield to tbe demand of tbe people for lower taxation, by reducing the expenses of the government and abolishing useless offices. Some of the bills were ns lollows: Further to protect executive officers and employes of the United States government from political assessments. [lt prohibits any Senator or Representative in Congress or officer appoint ed by tlie President from requesting or demand ing from any of the officers or employes of the government money or other thing of value for political purposes!] To reduce internal revenue taxation. To take the tax off fermented liquor and tobacco. To reduce postage to 2 cents. To repeal the internal revenue laws. To adjust taxation in the District of Colum bia, To abolish the offices of Assistant Secretaries of War and navy. To preserve the purity of the elective franchise and to punish bribery and other offenses against a free ballot. For the better regulation of tlie civil service. [lts object is to prevent removal of government officials except for cause, to provide a fixed tenure for subordinate officers, audio abolish the custom of political assesssments.) Trip. Transit op Venus, or tbo passage of tlie planet between tbe earth and the snn, on Wednesday, was one of tbe most import ant astronomical events of the century. Its value to science consisted in furnishing astron omers more accurate data than they bad for measuring the distance from tbe earth to tlie snn, which distance furnishes a unit for measurement of lire distance of oilier heaven ly bodies from each other. Tlie observations in lids country were fairly successful, but in England a snow-storm interfered. Tlie next transit of Venus wili not occur for 122 years —in June, 2004. Venus in passing across the disk of tlie sun looked like a very small black spot on the sun’s brightness, likened, by one lady observer, to tbe bead of a black bonnet-pin. Locai, Option tn Anne Arundel and Howard. —Local Option elections were held in Anne Arundel and Howard counties, on Tuesday. In Howard Hie vote was taken by districts, every district giving a majority against the sale of liquor. Tbe same result occurred in Anne Arundel, where the vole was taken in tbe aggregate. In Annapolis the unusual sight was seen of bands of wo men at Hie different polling places, singing, praying and admonishing voters to vote for prohibition. It was a frequent occurrence to sec a voter marched to Hie polls between two ladies and triumphantly voted in the interest of local option. —A horrible accident occurred in a Cin cinnati theatre, last Thursday alternoon. In the course of the play one of Hie actors, Frank Frayne, with a rifle shoots an apple from the bead of an actress, Miss Annie Von Belircn, standing with his back to her, look ing at her reflection in a mirror. Frayne had performed the feat successfully many times, but on the occasion referred to the ball struck tbe young lady squarely in Hie forehead, killing her instantly. As soon as Frayne fired be turned, as the young Indy fell, and rushing to her fell in a faint beside her. The curtain was immediately lowered, Hie spec tators thinking it all part of Hie play.— Frayne was almost wild with grief, having, it is said, been engaged to be married to Miss Von Bchren. It is time that the authorities should put a stop to sucli dangerous and de moralizing spectacles. —The Baltimore Day has been reduced in price to one cent a copy, or $3 a year. The Day is an able and fearless champion of Democratic principles, besides being an ex cellent newspaper. It deserves to be liber ally supported, and at the low price at which it is now published wc sec no reason why its subscription list should not bo more than doubled. Wc offer our good wishes for that result. —Another Canadian weather prophet, Professor E. Stone Wiggins, had arisen.— He lias written a letter to President Arthur, conveying the information, alarming If true, that a tremendous storm, next March, will submerge all the lowlands of the American coast and spread universal destruction.

No Small-Pox in Bel Air.— The report which appears to have been circulated In various parts of the county that there is a case of small pox in Bel Air, is not true.

Donat ion to a Castor, The donation party to Rev. E. D. Finney and wife, at the Presbyterian parsonage, in Bel Air, on Thanksgiving evening, was quite a surprise and a great pleasure to those who were so mate rially benefltted by It. As the clock struck seven the door bell was gently rung, and upon opening the door the porch appeared to he full of what is difficult to describe on paper. H urnan faces were seen and human voices were heard, hut there were huge brown and white sacks and bundles protruding along side of the faces, and packages of nil sizes and shapes in the hands and extended arms, and with their different colored bead cov erings of bonnets, nubias and hats, it was difficult in the dim evening light to tell Just what was coming in. But as the good host never runs from his own door, he bravely stood his ground, threw open widely his door and bade them come In and welcome. Then there began a great separation and division. The huge sacks were, with the help of others, let down to the Moor and put In a safe place, and the big bundles and little bundles with many good wishes, were laid down out of the way, and bonnets, hats, coats and shawls removed, and nil seemed to recognize each other, and the good host found he was In the midst of his friends, who had come In this manner to pay their respects to him and to replenish his larder. A most delightful and pleasant evening was spent, and after faring sumptuously on elegant cake and excellent coffee, brought prepared and served by the fair guests, all took their departure with light hearts and sweet recollections of the occasion and with the thanks and blessing of their pastor and his wife, wended their way homeward, and at ten o'clock the parsonage seemed to be all empty, except the larder, which in three hours’ time had increased its contents amazingly. May It have many happy returns of such a satisfactory increase. —•Unless It had groat merit Barker’s Ginger Tonic could not Ik* so popular.

No other newspaper published mi | (his side of the earth has been bought and read in ! any year by so many meu.aiid women. We am credibly informed that people buy, road, ami like* T/n Sim for I he following reasons, among others: Because its news columns preset it in attractive form aud with the greatest possible accuracy whatever has interest for humankind ; the events, the deeds and misdeeds, the wisdom. Hu? philoso phy, the notable folly, the solid sense, the im proving nonsense all the nows of the busiest world at present revolving in space. Because people have learned that iu its remarks ■ concerning persons and affairs Tit* Sim makes a practice of telling them the exact truth to the best of its ability three hundred ami sixty-five ' days iu Hu? year, before election as well as after, • about the whales as well as about the small llsh, 1 iu the face of dissent as plainly and fearlessly as when supported by general approval. The Sim ■ has absolutely no purposes to serve, save the in -1 formation of its readers and Hu? furtherance of the commoii good. Because it is everybody's newspaper. No man 1 is so humble that The Sun is inditl'ercnt to bis r welfare and bis rights. No man is so rich that it • can allow Injustice to be done him. No man, no • association of men, is powerful enough to be ex . empt from Hie strict application of Its principles I of right and wrong. ' Because in polities it has fought for a dozen years, without intermission and sometimes almost 1 alone among newspapers, the fight that has re , suited in the recent overwhelming impular ver ' diet against Dohesonism and for honest govern - inont. No matter what party is in power. The 1 Sim stands and will continue to stand like a rock ■ for the interest of the people against theambi i Hon of bosses, the encroachment of monopolists, ' and the dishonest schemes of public rob tiers. I All this is what we are told almost daily by our friends. One man holds that The. Sim is Hie best ’ religious newspaper ever published, because its Christianity is undiluted with cant. Another holds that it Is the best Republican newspaper printed, because it has already whipped half of the ras cals out of that parly, ami is proceeding against Hu* other half with umliminshed vigor. A third believes it to lx- the best magazine of general lit eriture iu existence, because its readers miss nothing worthy of notice that is current in the • world of thought. So every friend of The Sun • discovers one "f its many aides that appeals with , particular force (obis Individual liking. I f you already know The Sun. you will observe i that in 1883 it is a little better than ever before. If you do not already know Tin sun. you will And it lobe a mirror of all human activity, a store house of the choicest products of common sense | and imagination, a mainstay for the cause of hon est government, a sentinel for genuine Jelfrrson -1 ian Democracy, a scourge for wickedness of evety *! species, ami an imeommonSygood Investment for the coming year. i ' Terms (o Hull Subscribers.
