Your pro ceeding In that matter la approved. You will now Inform Lord Wharncllffe that permloslon for an agent of the committee described by him to visit the Insurgents detained in military prlsona of the United dtates. and to distribute among them 17,000 In British gold, Is disal lowed.

Finally, in view of this last officious lnte ventlon In onr domestic affairs, the American people can hardly fall to recall the warning of the father of our country, directed against so great and ultimately connected public dangers, namely, sectional faction and foreign Intrigue. I do not think tho Inaurrenta hT hnm debated, although they bavo sadly wandered from the waa of loyalty and patriotism. I think that, In common with all our country men, they will rejoice In being saved by their considerate aod loyal Government from the grave Insult which Lord Wharncllffe and his associates.
