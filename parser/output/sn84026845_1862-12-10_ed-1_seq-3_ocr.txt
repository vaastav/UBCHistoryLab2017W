The chair laid before the House a com munication from the Seci etary of War, in answer to a resolution calling for informa tion in relation to the sale of colored free men captured by the rebels. The reply of Secretary Stauton states that no information on the subject ie in possession of the War Department. Mr. Sherman presented a petition in fa vor of a general bankrupt act. Mr. Davis presented two petitions pro testing against the action of the advisory board of the nary. Mr. Sumner, from committee of foreign relational reported a bill for the relief of the owners of the French vessel Jutes et Marie. Mr. Anthony, from the committee on printing reported a bill to increase the bonds of the superintendent of printing. Mr. Hale Introduced a bill to abolish the grade of medical officers in the service of the United States. The resolution offered by Saulsbary re lative to arbitrary arrest of citizens of Del aware was taken up. Mr. Hale said the Senator from Delaware (Bayard) yesterday referred to a proper di vision of power as being the hope of a free government and he (Hale) was not willing to see the Senate interfere with other de partmenta. Mr. 8aulsbury did not donbt there were arrests made which were justifiable, but the?e men were citizens of Delaware, whose loyality had never been questioned. The motion to lay on the table was disa greed to by a vote of 3 yeas aod 40 nays. Mr. Field said be should vote against the resolution. Ue was of the opinion that the President had the right to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. The framers of the con stitution evidently provided that the ha. beas corpus might be suspended in time of insurrection and invasion. He thought it was creating an executive aot. He was of the opinion that if any complaint was to be made it was that the government had been too lenient to traitors. Bayard continued at some length, saying the power to sus pend the writ of habeas corpus WSS DOt an executive act. It this was admitted and the legislative power had no right to in quire, then the President might imprison men or torture them, or do as he pleased with them. Mr. 8hermen favored the adoption of all the resolutions of inquiry .which were of fered In good faith. He believed the right to suspend the writ of habeas corpus was purely a legislative power aod it could onlv be done by Congress, bat since the legisla tioo of the last Congress the President has had the power given to him he thought many of these arrests were great mistakes and every arrest ought to be reputed to Congress and the reasons tor it. 

HOC8B. Mr. Conway said he did not regard the proposition, as now presented, as having received the assent required by the Constitution, Western Virginia was not1 a lawful State. He believed it was the in tention of the President to encoumge State organisations in all the seceded States; but placing the assumption of the State in the baods of a few individuals appointed by the President, was flagrant and unconsti tutional. The scheme was revolutionary and ought to be exposed to the reprobation of every loyal citizen. It would be an ut ter perversion of oar system. It would io effect concentrate all the power of the Gov ernment in the hands of the executive. Mr. Brown, of Va., replied, arguing that the erection of Western Virginia was per fectly lawful and constitutional. The pro vision of the Constitution in regard to the admission or erection of new States bad been complied with and in thie connection be quoted as similar the preambte and act admitting Kentucky which was framed from part of Virginia. Precedents he in sisted, supported the new State organisa tion. Mr. Mallory said, I understand that more than half the counties of Virginia were not represented in the Weeeliog Leg. islature. Mr. Blair, of Va., asked: were not all tbe counties invited? Mr. Brown: all were expressly envited. Mr. Mallory?Although they were invi ted wece not some of them so completely within the control of a foreign government that they could not send representatives to the legislature 7 Mr. Brown?I can't say whether the peo ple were under intimidation or not. It Is sufficient to say that they were invited to come. If they staid away it was their fault not onrs. If tber were disloyal they could have no voice in the legislature of Virginia. Before Mr. Brown concluded tbe mora iog hour expired, when tbe House took op tbe special order authorising Assessors and Collectors and their assistants under tbe tax law to administer oaths, 4c. Tbe bill passed. *3Ir. Brown resomed bis remarks in ad vocacy of the bill for tbe admission of the State of West Virginia. He stated vari ous consideratloas why the State should be admitted as a matter of expediency. The people of that section had been struggling for forty years for a separate existence.? Tbey now "bad 16 regiments in the field, obtained by volunteering, not by draft. Mr. Colfax remarked that at the last session he had great doubts as to tbe pro priety of passing tfcls bill, but on examina tion his mind wasesade np last it ought to pass. Mr. Crittenden appreciated the patriot ism and valor of the people of Western Virginia and tbe desire which they, ex pressed to become a free people, bat on this matter be was not governed by feeliag but by thp principlt of Constitutional law. Congress could not admit a new State out of the ancient territory without the assent of the old Common weaKb, aod $1* had not been given. If States should be nt*4e in fbetoetfced propoied, new ones couUUml made a* pleasure,irrespective of the Compu tation of the United States. Mr. Kdwaids said he would sustain the loyal people.
