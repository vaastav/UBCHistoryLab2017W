CARRY YOUR OWN LUGGAGE. Pullman Car Company Adopts New Rules That Are Radical. Chicago, Dec. 7.—"Sorry, boss, but! yo'll have to carry yo' bag out yo'self, sah. That's the new rule, pah." This may be the new greeting of the Pullman porter from now on. It was! reported Sunday at one of the com- S :10.8010.75 pany's local offices that some new rules .|11.40il .47J11.32]1.1.3-7 111.42 would be instituted soon, and that an .tl0.75|10.80jl0.rr-'11.80|10.7o ol(l one—considerably obsolete—would Officially the report of the new rules was denied. Two division superintend ents, A. W. Giltzow and J. C. Patter son, said they had heard nothing of new orders. In substance the reported changes in the conduct and care of the Pull mans are as follows: No grip that will not go under a seat, or is in anywise in the way, will be allowed on Pullmans. Such luggage must be checked in the baggage car. Porters can not carry grips or bags to the vestibule of a car for passengers who are about to get off. The old rule, reported in line for re juvenation, is the one which forbids porters from brushing passengers oft anywhere in the car except at the end3. The Better Part.

The "insurgents" do not see any vulnerable points of attack just now, nor are there likely to be any until the. next congress votes again on the rules. However, they give out that they will watch every opportunity to remind him that they are camping on his trail. The senate insurgents ad mit the futility of reviving the tariff discussion, now that the Payne-Akl rich law is an accomplished fact, and they will probably be as incapable of successful action as the insurgents o£ the house. 17 19 20 15 17 16 IS steers steers steers steers steers steers steers Average.
