Tho Impudence of this nonresident In (insert ing that the opposition to his high-handed anil underhanded methods Rrows out of hln own HcrupulouM rcKanl for tho public welfare, Is no Brotffttuely abnurd and no palpably false that It falls of ltn own weight.

It Is estimated that It will require 110, 000,00ft to onmplet this proeet If bonds wero floated for tho purpose the government must needs pay Inleretn on tmm. "There Is no Uhj letting anybody g'sft on ih government like that," says tho Mule builder. Not at all. Orsftln off the government by ol looting a low rale of Intsrest for the im of money Is entirely wrong, but grafting off the government In building Impossible tin boats nr operating n. piece of government property fdr private profit that Is high-minded bllslneea according to Henry! I'ord ayn the government nhould lsue United Htatew eurrency for the amount noeen sary to complete tho Muse Hhoals plant. Therefore It would not be compelled l pay any body any profit for the thing. Aside from tho fact that here Is a piece of government prop erly whleh tho Musle builder wants to get hold of, It Is neeenwiry to Inquire Into this plan of financing. If It In wound finance for the, government to merely Iwttie Its promlso to pay In sufficient aunntlly to finance I'ord and his Muscle Hhoals pUnn, why should not the government go the wholo way and print enough paper'to retire It present bonded Indebtedness thus relieving Itself of all "graft" In the form of Interest Let Mr. Pord answer that tieetlon. Then ho might also answer this: Does ho Intend to recommend that this gov ernment embark upon the nam treacherous sea of Inflation which has all but wrocked hs bark of every llurnpeuu government? And about the "graft" Involved In charging the government for the tiej of private money doesn't thst rule apply more or less to tho manufacturer', rather Inslitent demind for a fair profit on his turnover? And finally, who miggcntcd to Henry Ford that ho Is an authority on finance? VATlOVAIi i:iUOATIONAIi 

WHHK. Aa on opportunity to gather the patronrt ot the public schools Into a single congregation and thus permit tho school authorities to dem onstrate precisely what It Is tho schools are doing, National educational Week constitute a worthy vehlolo for accomplishing a gonulno public rervlcc. It Hhould be scrupulously maintained for demonstration purposes only for Inspiring faith and ronfldenae In tho eohools of our land; for bringing closer together, perhaps, the teach ing body with tho patron body. Tulsa has every reason for feollng great prldo In Its public rchool system. Ciltlelnmu there are, of courts, but they must he crit icisms of detail rather than principle or pur pose. Tulsa possesses n. high school capable of affording the student every essential inrann for conquering the practical difficulties of life. We have no doubt that thero are boy and girl graduates of Tulsa High who will go as far and climb as high In life a any who seek greater academic learning elsewhere. It Is the primary or baso knnwledgo which counts In the long run. There nre many attractions In the city dur ing tho week, but none of these nhould prevent the parent and child from attending 'it least one of tho demonstrations of National Kduca. tlonal Week.
