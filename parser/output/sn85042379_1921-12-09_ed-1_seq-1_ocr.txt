GARDNER REFUSES TO TELL WHERE HE HID STOLEN MAIL Phoenix, Ariz., Dec.7.—Roy Gard ner, twice convicted of attempts to rob the United States mail and now on trial for a third alleged mail rob bery, was on the witness stand dur ing the entire morning in the United States district court here today. Gardner's continued refusal to tell where he had disposed of the mail sacks stolen from a mail car at Mari copa, Ariz., on November 3 brought a statement from Judge William H. Dawes' Budget Calls For Saving of $462,000,000 Washington, Dec. 5.—The federal budget for the fiscal year 1923—the first to be compiled—shows esti mated expenditures of $3,505,754,727, a decrease of $462,167,639 as com pared to the estimated outgo for the fiscal year 1922, anding next June 30, and a reduction of $2,032,285,962 from the actual outlay in the fiscal year 1821. Estimated receipts for 1923 are placed at $3,338,182,750, leaving an apparent dificit of $167,571,977. In transmitting the budget to congress today, President Harding says "ways are provided for the relatively easy adjustment of the discrepancy be tween income and outgo "without added taxation." As one means' he recommends legislation directing the reduction of the naval supply ac count by $100,000,000. Actual appropriations asked of congress for the varions federal de partments and agencies for 1923 to tal $3,224,875,592, exclusive of post office department. This represents a reduction of $122,806,310 from the original estimated as presented to the budget bureau, it is stated, but is approximately $27,000,000 more than the appropriation for the fiscal year. Explaining the $280,879,134 excess of estimated expenditures in 1923 over the appropriations asked for, Budget Bureau officials explain that some of the funds actually to be put ^ Jury t * iat suc ^ act i° n would Sawtelle, presiding at the trial, that if Gardner were not already under a long sentence he would punish him for contempt of court. The judge » "eless so far as Gardner was con ce^k " "cause he already was under sentence f alling 50 years. Gardnei direct examination occu pied about two hours. During that time he admitted having committed the theft at Maricopa. A large part of his testimony was intended to sub stantiate the defense's plea of in sanity. Under cross-examination, Gardner s aid that he would not tell Thomas A. Flynn, United States district attorney, nor E. B.

NOVEL CHRISTMAS PROGRAM A program of unusual interest and beauty will be presented by the high school students on Thursday evening before Christmas. The first part of the program will be several musical selections given under the direction of Miss Thornburg. The second part will be a dramatic performance en titled "Why the Chimes Rang", un der the direction of Miss Scanlan. The play is an adaptation from the story of the same name by R. N. Alden. It is one of the Samuel French copy right plays and is something enntire ly new and novel as a Christmas pro gram. The play has been presented successfully in Boston and in Cali fornia by groups of amateurs. The Christmas spirit pervales the entire drama. The drama lends itself to beautiful costume, stage and lighted effects, so the play will be one of the most beautiful performances of the school year. The cast of char acters will be presented next week. ONLY 20 ELK SEASON'S TOLL IN YELLOWSTONE REGION Elk slaughter for 1921 in the re gions adjoining the Yellowstone na tional park in Montana showed a tre mendous drop from the records of for mer years, it was announced Wednes day by Frank Marshall, a state game warden in that region. He says a care ful check of the elk killings in ,the Gallatin forest neighborhood revealed a total of only twenty. More than 250 hunters coming from one or two foreign countries and from many of the states of the union, tried their luck and failed. Mr. Marshall talked to 217 of these hunters. The elk remained in the park until the close of the hunting season, Novem ber 15. By an unusual coincidence, they were driven out on the last day of (♦îe season by the year's biggest snow there. The elk hunting at Gardiner also was a "frost", records having been obtained of only six killed. But the region lying along the south fork of the Flathead, in the western part of the state, came to the front as an ideal hunting ground, State Game Warden C. A. Jakways reports. Rangers in that country have reported on the killing of 115 elk. Washington, Dec. 7.—Nominations transmitted to the senate today by President Harding included: Charles A. Rasmussen, internal collector for Montana; Arthur T. Moon, receiver of public moneys, Salt Lake City. out will be carried over in continu ing appropriations and by other means. They say that appropriations for a given year do not accurately re flect actual expenses for that year, pointing out that while the appro priations for this fiscal year were $3,197,807,962, the estimated actual outgo will exceed this sum by ap proximately $770,000,000. * Of the total expenditures for ]923, approximately $2,900,000,000 is to pay for past wars and to keep up the fighting arms of the government, elaving only about $600,000,000 for the peace-time pursuits of the federal establishment. The estimate for the army and the navy is $801,636,107, a reduction of $66;305,299 as com pared with this fiscal year and $956, 352,741 as compared with the fiscal year 1921. The navy estimate of $431,754, 000, it is explained, does not take into account any possible reduction that might be brought about as a re sult of the arms conference, the total including funds for continuing work on the ships of the 1916 program, most of which would be scrappad under the proposal made to the con ference by the American government. Accompanying the budget as sent to congress is a detailed report from Director General Dawes as to the op eration of the .budget bureau since its establishment five months ago and some pointed comments as to means of continuing its efficient operation. Christmas Seals and Their Purposes Glasgow is very fortunate in having for local director of the Red Cross Seal drive, Mrs. Olivia Forster-Pat ton, county superintendent of schools for Valley county. She has worked out a very admirable scheme for the promotion of the Seal Sales. It is her idea that the hearts of the parents and friends can best be reached by the younger school children. Proper and suitable literature has been dis tributed to the various grade schools in the county explaining the purpose of the drive. This literature is given to the children to take to their par ents and friends, also a number of seals. Talks are also given at the schools which explain the humanitar ian purpose to which the money is to be put that will be raised by the sale. In ordpr that those who are not reach ed by the children may know the de tails of the drive, Mrs. Patton explains its purpose herewith: How a few pennies may be trans formed into a million dollars, sounds like a visionary scheme of some sort, but 'how to do it" has been shown in the shinging example given by the Tuberculosis Christmas Seal Sale, which started in 1908 with a little over $100,000 and attained a magni tude of $3,650,000 in 1920! This money has, for the most part, been invested in education and organ ization—something that one cannot be translated into dollars and cents. Tu berculosis work today is one of the greatest voluntary social movements in the world, and is a monument to the development of the Christmas Seal just as the Woolworth building stands in New York as a monument to the power of small sales. The Christmas seal has given the millions of contributors a sufficient return on their money. By community organization and education it has stimulated the development of hospi tals, sanitoria, open air schools, clinics and other agencies for the prevention and cure of tuberculosis, until today there is invested in machinery of this character over $150,000,000, most of 

DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION GIVES OUT A FEW FACTS Local Dairymen to Sell Milk That Will Comply in Every Way With State Laws. For two days, once a month, dur ing the year, Miss Mary Anna Gra ter, state dietition, works with the children and mothers of Glasgow, weighing and scouring the children and advising mothers the proper food to bring the child up or down keep a normal weight. In these health clinic classes Miss Graber ad vises as to food for the children and in all cases she has recommended good clean filtered milk. There is no other food that requires more care ful handling "than milk. The mothers of the city buy milk to feed their chcildren and they have a right to know what good clean milk consists of and what is required produce good clean milk. They have a right to know what the law requires of their milk man and whether their milk man is living up to the require ments of the law or not. There is an association in the city having for its motto, the production of good clean milk according to the state law and to help every milk pro ducer put out a better product and product that will come up to what the law requires to have it called— "inspected milk". This association the "Glasgow Dearymen's Associa tion." There is at large in the city some folks ideas about the association and it is the purpose of this article right these false ideas and to give the public the true object of the association and why it was organized. Object To give to the milk users of Glas gow a better and cleaner milk. To help every milk producer Glasgow to comply with the state law and score high enough to sell "inspected milk". To hold monthly meetings at which educational subjects on dairying will be discussed. Why Organized The association was not organized to control prices. The association was organized in order to bring the dairymen of Glasgow together for the purpose of meeting Dr. Richard son, deputy state veterinary, so that he could explain and interpret the state dairy law for them. To tell them how they could impprove their places, their herds and their product. These meetings with Dr. Richardson have been very valuable and helpful. The association has ordered for all recommended by Dr. Richardson, the Gurler sanitay milk pail and filter which means that all the milk pails are closed while milking and that all this being from public funds—federal, state and city. "Pie Christmas Seal has made this development, and one may rightly say, ltherefore, that the $16,000,000 that tlje public has invest ed in Christmas seals in the past thir teen years, has been multiplied, not twice nor three times, but ten times, and the multiplication is going on every day. In Montana not quite $7,000 was raised in 1916—the year of the first sales by the tuberculosis association in the state, and in 1920 penny seals amounting to $19,775 were sold. Mrs. Morse, secretary of the Montana Tu berculosis association, has sent $30, 000 worth of seals to various chair men throughout the state, for the 1921 campaign, which extends from Thanksgiving until Christmas. These seals can, and will be sold, for Mon tana people realize more and more each day the immense benefits derived from the seal campaign. A dollar invested in Christmas seals is not a static dollar. 95% of it is spent in the state wherein it is raised, where it keeps moving, growing into many dollars and into renewed strength and health for hundreds and of persons. Movies, occasional street parades and circuses, and all the other attrac tions of the large towns in Montana mean much to the children in these towns, but for children in remote sec tions of the state there is nothing of that sort. Those youngsters like to be entertained too —like the fascina tion of the things which amuse the city youngsters whom they sometimes envy just a lttle. Forty three children in a scattered communnity in the eastern part of the state think they are going to have a delightful time this winter, for the young teacher who has brought so many stories, new Ideas and interest ing ways of doing things into their lives, has introduced the Modern Health Crusade into the school and has discarded the old, dry way of teaching physiology. The days of chivalry—health chivalry—now pre the milk passes through two layers of sterilized gauze and one layer of absorbent cotton, thus no milk man can be dipping hfs fingers in the pail while milking. Explanation of Terms Inspected cows. All dairy cows must be free from disease and spec ial stress is put on tuberculosis. Cows that have been inspected and a certificate of inspectcion issued does not mean that inspected milk comes from that herd, it just means that the cows are free from disease but the milk may be filthy and unfit for use due to the way it is handled. Having inspected cows is a long way from being able to sell inspected milk. Inspected milk. It is milk pro duced by cows free from infectious, contageous disease as determined by the tuberculosis test. All dairies producing inspected milk must score at least seventy per cent on an offi cial score approved by the Montana Livestock Sanitary board. Inspect ed milk or cream shall be deliverel in bottles only. The caps of such bottles shall note the classification of the milk or "ream the bottle con tains. The milk user can depend on it that every milk producer is going to put on his bottle caps the word, "in spected milk" if the state law will permit. The association has ordered caps and within two or three weeks its members will be using the caps as required by law. Watch for the caps on your milk bottles. Dairies scoring below seventy per cent on the official score^ard must use caps marked "market milk". Milk of this classification may be delivered in bottles or cans, but all containers must be marked "market milk" so that the consumer may de termine the grade of the milk or cream for sale. Milk or cream of this designation must be pasteur ized or sterilized before being sold or used for human consumption or used in the manufacturing of any dairy food products. It is roped that this article will clear the situation and explain the place and existence of the Dairy men's association. Outsiders are wel come to all meetings. It is the ef forts of the association to bring ev ery dairy up to the inspected stand ard by the beginning of the new year. SPECIAL FARE GRANTED Farmers, bankers, farm bureau representatives and others will gather in Bozeman at the state college Jan uary 9 to I ! for the annual Farmers Week and Short Course for Bankers. A number of other interesting meet ings are to be held in Bozeman at the same time, including the annual Boys' Vocactional Congress and the annual show of the State Rabbit Breeders association. Special railroad rates have been allowed. vail in that school, and pages, squires, knights and knight bannerets there take as great an interest in health and sanitation as ever a knight of old took in a tournament. Elements of play and romance have been introduced in to the teaching of hygiene and phys iology, and it is all very fascinating, and instructive too, for the young sters. To brush ones teeth, to keep ones ears clean, to wash ones hands before eating are all a part of health chcivalry, and a page, a squire or knight would never go to school with a dirty neck, or "swap" his chewing gum with another knight—no, never! Then there are health plays which are given, when the value of good health and the necessity of public health work are shown to the parents of the young crusaders. It is all fun, but underneath all of the fun are deep lessons in health and community and personal cleanliness. The Crusade which is now being adopted in the schools all over the United States, and which has over 30,000 children enrolled in Montana, has proven to be the most successful system of health education yet de vised. It is supported in this state through the sale of seals by the Montana Tuberculosis association as a part of its work for the children of the state. The association knows that tuberculosis can never be eradicated until a firm foundation is laid in the health of the children. It believes that through the development of good health habits, in the Crusade, that the children's resistance to disease is built up, their interest in home and community sanitation developed and eventually the number of cases of tu berculosis and other infectious dis eases decreased. The association also furnishes free milk for undernourished children at nutrition clinics, supports clinic for the removal of adenoids and tonsils, maintains dental clinics, and co-oper ates with the health programs of the Boys and Girls clubs, the Farm Bu reau and the Camp Fire Girls.

GEORGE HEMBRY MARRIES From a news item taken from the Spokane Daily Chronicle we find the following in a list of marriage li censes. George Hembry (50) Deer Park and Mary E. Shaw (16) Deer Park. It is taken for granted by the pub lisher of The Tribune that George has decided that going it single is about to be discontinued by him for the time being at least. Mr. Hembry is well known to most of the readers of this paper as well as to the citizens of Valley county.-— Hinsdale Tribune. WATCH FOR TUBERCULOSIS Dr. Howard Welch of the state col lege veterinary department warns poultry keepers to keep a strict watch for tuberculosis, which is growing rapidly among flocks over the coun try. It is easily the 'foremost of poultry diseases. County agents are doing good work in helping rid the state of this disease, but they need more co-operation from growers.

Because of all diseases com mon to man, tuberculosis is the most wide spread and the most deadly 2. Because thousands of our children are exposed to the dis ease and may die before they reach middle life unless protected. 3. Because tuberculosis killed 476 of our citizens in Montana last year. 90 per cent of the money raised goes to the National Association. Have you a heart big enough to stays in Montana.

Chief Recommendations In Message From Harding President Harding informed con gress Tuesday, in his first annual message, that "a most gratifying world accomplishment" by the arms conference "is not improbable." The message was delivered by the presi dent in person in the chamber of the house and in the presence of the dele gates to the conference and most of ; the diplomats regularly stationed in Washington. At the outset, the president discuss ed world conditions, saying "that a world restoration program" would have to be worked out "by the nations more directly concerned."

Hall, assisted by Under-sheriff Hanson, on a charge of making moon shine-whiskey. A considerable quan tity of mash and equipment was brought in to the county jail to be used as evidence when the case comes to trial at the January term of court.

AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK In the observance of American ed ucation week the attention of the country is called to the report of Dr. Claxton, commissioner of educa tion. As a result of the financial stringency he directed his attention to the study of the comparative ex penditure of the American people for Claxton used the reports of the Amer luxuries and for education. Dr ican government for statistics. He concluded that the American people could still afford to maintain public education. The evidence he found showed that during the year 1920 the American people expended the fol lowing amounts fqr luxuries and for education: For cigarettes $ 800,000,00 For tobacco and snuff 8 00,000,000 For cigars 510,000,000 Ice cream 250,000,000 Face powder, cosmetics, Soft drinks 350,000,000 perfume 750,000,000 Luxurious service 3,000,000,000 Joy rides, pleasure resorts, raees 3,000,000,000 Contrast the above amounts with the amounts spent for education as compiled from the last available statistics, 1918: Elementary and high schools for one year $762,259,154 Normal shools 20414,689 University and colleges .... 137,005,415 Total for education in one year 919,729,258 It is obvious that the amount spent on education of all character is but i little more than what is spent on either item of cigarettes or tobacco in one year.

With regard to the merchant ma rine, Mr. Harding said it was the pur pose to present a plan which "contem plates no greater draft on the public treasury, and which, though yet too crude to offer it today, gives such promise of expanding our merchant marine that it will argue its own ap proval." "Proper encouragement" for the co operative marketing programs as a means of assisting in the relief of present conditions in agriculture was suggested by the executive.
