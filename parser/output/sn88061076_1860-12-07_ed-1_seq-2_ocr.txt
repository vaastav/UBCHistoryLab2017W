RKSV ILLI Friday, December 7, I860. t&- Tim pica which many, In th North, rgc in defence of their Toto tor Lincoln Is, thai tlicy were Inflaenccd by no anti-slavery feeling, but by a determination to defeat the Democratic party. The question then It wlftthcr it were batter to tulm(t,a while longer, to corrupt rale, or to endanger the Unioa by a lectional trtumph of the North over the South. It is a dangeroui doctrine that It l right to do wrong because, perchiince, good may come of it, and it rarely happens that the expected good doet aot turn out to be a serious mischief ai la th'n case. Ilnd those Northern men who rccVless 1 hazarded all in order to bent the Democratic par ty, nailed heartily upoa, and worked energetically far the Union ticket, Lincoln could not hare been elected; and bud they pursued this course in the State election! which just preceded the rote for President, Dell wonld bare carried many of the Southern States as to hare ensured hi election, ei ther by the people or the House. But by not adopt ing tliU policy, they gave to the ttruggle, In the North, so decidedly a sectional character that thous n ll of Bell men in the South, alarmed by the tignt of the timet, and disgusted with, what teemed to tbem, the all pervading anti-tlarery fanaticism of the North, resolved, unwisely, we think, to meet sectionalism with sectionalism, and, without count ing the probable cost, went over to the disunion party. Tuns the wrong step taken hy Northern conservatives was followed by disastrous results tn both sections, whereas, had they pursued the right for the sake of the right, Lincoln wonld have been politically burled, and evils threatened, and those already upon us, would have been averted. The madness and blindness which actuated the apposi tion U Lincoln and actually made him President, are astounding, and now thai they have worked oat their legitimate results, all sorts or pleas are advan ced, by the guilty parties, te paliate the damning wrongs they have inflicted upon their common . country. And now that the mischief Is done, we, of the South, are asked to discriminate, la our com mercial intercoms, between the real anti-slavery fanatics and those who acted with them from hostil ity to Democracy, 'or devotion to certain State and local Interests. Such a discrimination Is lmpractl cable, because the South cannot know the the indi viduals comprising the one class or the other. fca? The Presidcut'a Message hi'j uot yd been received, but the telegraph gives a toop?l of his iewi upon the present absorbing topic of secession. lie deiiet the right of a Stub to secede the idea being Incompatible with the natmeof the Federal Constitution but declares his inability to enforce the laws in South Carolina, because there are no Federal officer, In Hint State, to execute them, and avers that the Constitution confers no power upon the Executive U coerce a seceding State. The im pression left upon our mind by his reasoning is, th.nl he denies the right of secession, as as abstract pro position, but affirms it as a practical one, by declar ing thnt neither the Constitution nor the laws pro vide for its prevention. If this last position be correct, the right of secession follows, of coursc,njid his argument it a qnibhle. As a remedy for Impending evils, he advises an amendment of the Constitution to be confined to a settlement of Its conduction on the three following points: First An express recognition of the rights ot property in slaves in the Suites which now exist or may hereafter exist. Skcoxd The duty of protectine this rltrht In all common territories throughout their territorial exis tence, and mitil they shall be admitted as States into the Union, with or without slavery, as their consti- lunon may present. Third A like recognition of the riirht of the master to have his slave, who has escaped from sue State to another, restored and delivered up to him, and of the validity of the fugitive slave law, enact ed for this purpose, together with a declaration that all State lawt impairing or defeating this rirf t are fivinuuHsui luo vuusiuuuun, ana urc conscqucnuy null and void. If the telegrnphic abstract be correct, the Message contains nothing, on this subject, that Is new in point of theory, and suggests nothing in. the shape of a remedy, that has not been repeatedly laid be fore the people ; and unless his high position may give force to views so often expressod before he re peated them, this part of bis Message might as well not have been written. RiX. All the argument about the right to secede, is laljor lost. Tho. who do not desire to secede, are satisfied tin t t, State lint no such right, and those who are bent upon secession will not bo con vinced by the most conclusive evidence." tST The IiiUiannpolis Journal says he is willing that southerners shall travel through the North, ac companied by slaves, but will not concede the right of such slaves to demand their freedom whenever so carried into a free State. That is kind even mag nanimous; bnt it it likely thnt no southerner will svail himself of such intense liberality and coo rh-cyi and ll is more than probable that very few from the South, will hereafter be seen traveling through the North, with or without slave attendants. P3S Chesnut, Hammond and Bonham who re signed their teats in .the United States Congress, could not resist the temptation to make one more grab at the.fcderul purse, and have, accordingly re sumed their vacated tents.

It Is the cerqmon remark of those B reck in ridge inea who really deplore, the election of Lin cola, and the evilt that have already followed it, that it couldn't be helped, and thut the result would have been the same even if they had voted fur Bel; And Evorctt. We believe tli result weuld bave been the same after a full Breckinridge ticket had been nominated : but we do not believe it would bave been the tame bad the bolters, at Baltimore nominated the Unioa ticket, or made no nomina tion at all. Either evidence of an earnest desire to defeat the Black Republicans, with such a prospect of uniting the South as would thereby have been held out, could not have fulled to array, the entire Northern opposition against Lincoln. But, in the absence of any tuck evidence, and with tho fulj knowledge acquired by expericuce that theDcin ocrats hold their party tucccst paramount to evcry other consideration, and believing that all sorts of tricl.s would be tried to maintain its ascendency, the conservative! of the North blindly threw their weight into the Republican scale, and behold the result I We publish, to-day, the proceedings of the Union Meeting held in the Court House, on Monday last. We knew nothing of it until it was over, and, of course, were not present, and can say nothing of it beyoad what is set forth la the proceedings. The only authoritutivo mode of arriving at the senti ment of Tennessee, in relation to tbe issues before the country, is through a convention ordered by the Legislature. Local meetings carry but little weight, and are, at best, an imperfect index to public opin ion. On the subject of union, or disunion, Tennes see spoke out, at the ballot-box, on the sixth of No- vemlier lost, and her voice was emphatic for the nion ; and unless new questions are raised, there is nothing to decide. A Convention of the State, by authority, may do great good if its deliberations he directed to the question of the best means for the redress ot wrongs to the South, in the Union, and to the prevention of secession by bringing about united action of all the slave States for the same end ; and even to give the decisions of such con vention the force they ought to bave, the Legisla ture, inorduring It, should provide that overy county shall havo two dclegntes, one to lie chosen from each party. If this be done, the charge of tmrty- ism cannot be preferred against the convention, and its proceedings will commit both parties to its poli cy, and thus secure unanimity of action and, har mony of opinion. ttS" The exodus from "swate" Ireland still con tlnuet without any apparent dimnnitiou of num Iters, and the United States is the blessed country upon which is conferred the blessing of the pres ence of the countless hordes of "Paddys'' wnodai ly swell the anti-slavery ranks. Con. Jackson once taid it was time we were becoming a little more Americanized ; but the prosjiect is that our nation ality is to be swallowed up by foreign immigration and our governmcut overthrown, through the bnl lot-box, by a foreign element every way unfitted for the exercise of tho elective franchise, yet unwisely allowed Die privilege This it another crying ev for the continuance of which Democracy it respon- tible, and the effects of which are now to deeply fell throughout the length and breadth of the Re public All the Injurious measures and demoralis ing practiies which have thwarted the ends of ad ministralive wisdom, and sapped the fouudation of public virtue, are of Democratic origin, and the cor rupt means employed to maintain its ascendency are now telling with fatal effect upon tho whole country threatening to Involve the innocent with the guilty in one common ruin. It affords us no pleasure to arraign this party, at this juncture, bo fore the tribunal of public opinion, but the charges are true, hud ought not to be withheld from tbe people who have been led into dangerous errors be cause the troth bos not been told them hy thoir worst enemies under the garb of friends. BSEf Wo loam from tho. Richmond Whig, thnt Gov. Letcher hat issued his proclamation, declaring the Electoral voto of Virginia to be nine for Bell and six for Breckinridge. As this state of things it decidedly anomalous, some explanation Is needed. n the first place, it Is not duntud by (he Governor that Bell carried tho State by a majority of about three hundred; in the second, the basis of his de cision Is informality, in tome of the counties, by Commissioners appointed by himself; and in the last placo, his party bet heavily upon the result, and those bets will be saved by this division af the Electoral vote. What, then, is. the character of that informality ? Nothing more or lest than tbe wrong spelling of the names of some of the Electors. This being the pitiful pica upon which the Cover aor bases his decision, there is reason to believe that the Electoral College will reverse it. If the Breck inridge Electois are honorable men, they will sanc tion no such injustice claim no division of the Electoral vote with a clear majority against them. The informalities which give the pretext for this swindle, are not the fault of the voters, who, for want of printed tickets enough not being supplied wrote them and miaspolled names ; and neither law nor equity nothing but corrupt party spirit can sauction tucb a decision as that arrived at by the Governor and hit legal adviser. Sonic of the Northern papors are very in. dinnnt because Northern men who come South, on legitimate business, are insulted and ordered off but they rcraemlicr to forget, that when southern men go North to reclaim their property a legiti mate business they are insulted and mobbed. Not only has this treatment of southern men been tolerated by northern sentiment, and a violution of the law shamelessly overlooked, but it dates back to a period long anterior to any occurrence of the sort in the South. There it tlihi marked difference, to, in tho cases cited the northern people, stealing nud harboring slaves, are guilty of wilful aggression upon southern rights, whilst tho expul sion of iiliolitionisUs, from the South, it an act of sclf-defcuce. Public Meeting. At a meeting of the eitizens of Montgomery Couaty, held at the Court House in Clarksville, Ten nessee, on Monday, December 3d, 1860, on motion of II. S. Kimble, the Hon. Care Johnson was de clared President, and N. B. Dudley and B. A. Rog ers were appointed secretaries. The Hon. Cave Johnson, on taking the Chair, spoke cloqucn'.ly and earnestly in advocacy of the Union, and denounced, in strong language, the doc trine of secession. On motion of Jas. X. Bailey; the Chair appointed the following gentlemen at a Committee on resoluj tlons. The resolutions explain fully the object of the meeting : Dr. n m. Drane, T. W . Vt isdom, bsq Tho. L. Yancey and It. F. Ferguson. , While tie committee were absent preparing the resolutions, the meeting was addressed in able and patriotic siieeches bv Jas. K. Bailey, A. Robb, N. B. Dudley, Joha F. IIoujc, and others. Dr. Drane, the Chairman of the Committee, re- portcdthe following resolutions, which were adop ted: Rttulvtd, 1st, Thnt the union of the States crca ted by tbe Federal Constitution, was the work of the wisest aid best men that ever lived In this or any other country, and comes to us recommended by them as tbe "Palladium of onr Liberties," and mora than seventy years experience proves that it has conferred more prosperity and happiness on our citizens than was ever enjoyed by any other people n the language of an illustrious statesman : ''It must be prHcrved.'" Krtolved. id. 1 bat the Constitution imposes do ties niion each of tlio States toward the others, Uint should be faithfully and promptly performed, and cannot be pretermitted, without endangering the peace ef the country, and the permanency of the Union, and among them is the restoration of fugi tive slaves to the owner's, a duty of so much im portance to tho Southern States that it caunot be dispensed with. llemlvnl, 3d. That seme of tho Mates, disregard ins the obligations imposed on them by I lie Const! tution, and thoir oaths to support it, have in effect nullihed the acts of Congress, and created obstacles to its execution by State legislation thnt greatly im pairs its usefulness; 'and by encouragement of mobs in thoir resistance to tho ollicers of tbo law, produ cing great loss to the citizens of the South, and ma terially atlRCting tbo value ot that kind ot property in certain portions of tho Southern -States, it he? comes proper and necessary to bave further action on tbe part of Congress, and such additional penal' ties as will suppress such violationsof the law here after, as well as all other unlawful assemblies in tlie free States, that give assistance to fugitives, or ex cite Insurrection among the slaves, and at tho game time to use the power and innuenee of the Federal tlovernmeut to cause a repeal of tbe obnoxious State laws, and thus restore harmony between the differ ent sections of the country. Retolvrd, 4f A. Thnt the election of Abrabnrn Lin- twin to tho Presidency, upon tho principles pro claimed by tbe Republican party, is a just cause cf alarm to the citizens of the south, for the safety and protection of its property, and renders it pra dent for each Slate to prepare for its defence against anv and every contingency. Kttotved, bih. That sbould tlie Mouth fail after using all proper efforts to secure the protection its property, and that equality is the Union to which it is entitled under the Constitution, the time will then have arrived to consider whether we will br.V up the Government, or by force drive out of the Ua ion tbe ottending M talcs, wnicn so lur forget tlie ob ligations assumed by tbem oncoming into the Con federacy, regardless of the solemn oaths tal.on by them to supiiort it, and reckless of their duty to their country and their God. Ketohtd, Clh. Iu view of the alarming condition of public affairs, we deom it expedient that the Leg islature of the State of Tennessee shall be convened to enact such laws as may be necessary, to consider tlie policy to be adopted by the Slate of Teunessee, and to take such action in reference to a Convention of the Southern States, or of the wbelo Union, as the exigencies of the country may require. Jifolved, 7 (A. That His Excellency the Governor be requested by proclamation to call the Legislature to meet at such time as lie niuy ducm best. On motion of J. E. Bailey, It was Remhtd, That tlo proceedings of the meeting be published in the Clarksville and Nashville papers, and a copy of the same transmitted to ins bicel' leucy Gov. Harris. Hon. l'AVB
