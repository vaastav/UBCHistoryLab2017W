'.Wdrer, one month ago we vacated •the editorial chair for the purpose of visiting our friends and taking a little rest, the election was over, and all over i the country the lightning nerves of wire .were thrilling the people with the jgy-i r fnl intelligence of a bloodless ewlCest ended and a bloodless vicUwy won. To our city the glorious news had not yet come how the great states had so nobly stood by the government and j emphatically denounced a movement whose origin was deep down in the, hearts of misled and infatuated men. We went otlr way and in a lew days we "received a copy of th. I’,( porter— our paper and read —“ The election it over carried fur (Irani by //icon* the mutt corrupt, ditgrare/al, damnable that ever ilithonored our nation, etc., etr." —We threw down our paper in disgust, we re-read the “damning lie” and thought, are we again slaughtered in the house of our friends V Andj then we thought how grandly the old Keystone slate had placed the seal of righteousness upon the common verdict rendered by the grandest jury ever empanelled, and we were satisfied, lay ing nothing ]) against him who so in discreetly had wounded us in body and mind, knowing that many things are penned in the heat of excitement that thetOWol soher second thought cd‘ im fifeisial judgment, would never give to thr ilight Readers of Che Reporter : Our prin ciples are to-day tin- szmo as a month ago,—we have never surrendered them, and so long as we hold the helm of the ship we sail, we propose to keep it in Republican waters, and aloof the rocks and quicksands of the treacherous sea of Democratic—Liberalism. Horace Greeley Dead. The painful rumor reaches us, au thenticated, that Horace Greeley is dead. Humors have been rife for scv-i oral woAs that Mr. Greeley hud been] suffering from severe nervous proslru-j tion ; that he was insane, and liable to I be taken off at any’ time. Those havei been repeatedly contradicted, but the! telegraph brings us the unmistakable fact that Horace Greeley is dead. Mr j Greeley * death waa undoubtedly has tened by th(> anguish experienced hv the loss of his wife, though wo verily j believe the intense excitement and eon-1 slant wear upon n system such as his, ' by the continued and unremitting ex-! citements of a campaign, such as hasj just terminated, has had very much to i do with his decease. The whole nation will mourn the loss j of Mr. Greeley, even those who j were his bitterest political enemies, will feel pangs of sorrow as they think of the great light that has gone out from the earth forever. We shall hear more in connection with his death and burial soon, which wu will give our readers in our next issue, fa?’" That roost eloquent and most active of all the war Governors, Rich ard Yales, of Illinois, is a total wreck —driven to the lowest depths of a drunkard’s lot. lie was on a two or three day’s spree in Chicago a short time since, ending it by falling in a fit jn company with lewd women.

It is amusing to an outsider, who has not a cent to gain or lose in the fluctuations oi stocks, to watch the grappling* of the Hulls with the Bears, and vice vena. In the recent contest, where millions were staked and lost or won, by the manipulations of wily gamblers, whose money makes their iniquity honorable, three noted personages figured to an extent hitherto unknown in the history of H. R. Stock gambling, viz.: Vander bilt, Gould and Drew. Drew, it seems, was worsted but will recover with a slight loss of only -.700,000 dollars. Vanderbilt has been endeavoring to got possession of the Chicago and Northwestern I! K, and without doubt will be successful. Undoubtedly such j change in the conduct of this great [ thoroughfare would he advantageous to j Wisconsin interests, Tiik (OUN'Ett in Northwestkhn Common.— ThJ corner in New Vork on Northwestern common on Saturday afternoon approached i's climax, the stock being sold at HOO, or -00 per cent, premium above par.

It is not yet known whether Vanderbilt will get possession of thu Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Cos., and eject President Tra cy. Vanderbilt got out his tomahawk and scalping knife with the intention I of butchering Tracy, but it is uncertain i whether ho has succeeded in getting j Tracy’s whole scalp. In sumo respects wc sympathize with Tracy; because if the Tracy regime continues in power, it is quite sure the Lodi I! H. extension will be built next season. But it is not certain what would he the Vanderbilt policy if one of his instruments should be placed at ; the head of the Northwestern R. K. | Some think he would immediately or | der the Northwestern to pro rule in Wisconsin, that is, to carry freight i cheaper to Milwaukee than Chicago, i Of course such a change would be im mensely to our advantage, as it would I give us what we are now deprived of through an unjust discrimination, namely, the natural advantages of our position. The market price of wheat and corn is always in our favor, but our superiority in this regard has been neutralized by the low rates at which freight has been taken to Chicago by the Northwestern R. R. The amount of common stock of j Chicago arid Northwestern R. R. Cos. i is $14,720,950; ami of preferred, j $20,415,049. It is supposed that I the Vanderbilt ring bought $20,000,- 000 of common stock ; and therefore ! the shorts have sold $5,000,000 in j excess of the supply.
