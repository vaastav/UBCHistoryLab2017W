Abraham Hendricks, grandfather of the late Vice President, was a "Justice of the Peace at Lancaster, Pa in 1804. A stone house which he built near West Fairchild is still standing. ; The Sandwich islands are offered , for sale for $14,500,000. The Phila delphia Press remarks that "the property consists of two sugar houses, one extinct volcano and seven hurfdted cases of leprosy, all Mnjcoiddling repair." It is rumored that Mr. Geo. H. Pendleton is dissatisfied with the Berlin Ministership. Well,' let him resign and come home. He can, and ought to live without it. There are plenty of good Democrats who will accept it and be satisfied. : . The Ohio State Journal followed by other Republican papers, have threatened any Republican mem ber of the Assembly with assassina tion if he joined the Democrats to elect a Democratic or a conservative Republican U. S. Senator. This is a fact. Hon. John W. Daniels has been chosen United Statu3 Senator by the Virginia Legislature to succeed Mahone. He is one of the brighest men of the present day and famous . for his eloquence. It is the grand est swap ever made in the American Senate. . In 1876, Iowa gave Hayes 59,000 plurality ; in 1880, she gavcTJarfield 45,000, in 1884, Blaine 20,000 ; and in 1885, the republican candidate for governor 6,000. This shows that the republican majority in Iowa has been subsiding at the rate of 6, 000 a year, on an average, since 1876, and indicates that things may come to a very interesting pass at the next State election. We gave the President's message I w o last week in an extra and we hope all our readers read it. It was Ion?:, but considering that it was twenty- four years since a Democrat had the privilege of addressing the" people from the White House, don't think there was any too'much of it. The Pittsbnrg Dispatch, the lead ing Republican paper of that city, is. much disturbed over the condi tion of the Republican part v. It demands that the Taetion fighting be brought to an end, and that the only way to make an end of it is to send Blaine and Conkling to the rear. .' ' - ' .. The State Supreme Court has re versed the decision of the Circuit Court and ordered in effect that the certificates of re-election be given to four Democratic Senators. This is claimed as a "partizan" decision So- was the Circuit Court, but the Supremo Court had the last "whack" and is on top. The seventh day of April, 18S8, will be the centennial of- the first settlement in Ohio at Marietta. The Ohio State Board of Agriculture, the Ohio Archaeological and Histor ical Society are desirous of appro priately celebrating the occasion, and are already making some prep arations to honor the day. The commissioner of the general land office says that his annual re port will show, that between 75 and 95 per cent.- of the land entries made arc fraudulent. He will re commend a revision of the system of making entries, and the utmost care in appointing land agents and registers who, he says, are honest good men." Butte City, Montana, has a popu lation of 18000 ; 4,000 to 5,000 of whom are employed in the mines at $4.50 per day, and fully, as many men are idle. The town supports five daily newspapers, five brass and stiing bands and fifteen gam bling establishments, four " variety theatres and one opera house, which are doing a rushing business every night.. ; The liquor question is rapidly taking the form of license orno li cense everywhere. Massachusetts is to vote upon it at the approach ing municipal elections. It would take that shape in Ohio but for the Republican opposition. It is too good a thing for Republican politi cians to juggle with as it is, . and they never will consent to its settle ment so long as it can be used for political purposes. There are, according to the report of the Governor of Washington Ter., says the Chicago Inter Ocean, within its limits 23,000,000 acres of public lands unsurveyed, and of this at bast 16,000,000 acres is excellent agricultural land well timbered. The Territory at present has a pop ulation of 138, 438 souls, being an increase of 36,939 in two years. The assessed value of property in the territory is $50,494,437. Gen. S. B. Buckner, of Kentucky, is prominently mentioned for the Governorship of that State. His friendship for Gen. Grant at a time when friends were most needed, has in turn, won him many admirers who would be glad to see him thus honored. Kentucky cannot do much, better than to select as its next Governor, the man who-fought so well in war and in peace so. nob ly sprang to the help of his former opponent. ' The people of Georgia have taken a step toward prohibition which is probably the most complete of that of any State in the country. It is prohibition that prohibits. Of the 136 counties in Georgia more than 100 already have taken advantage of the local option law, and have declared in favor of -prohibition. The new law is so strict that it pro hibits the prescription-of liquors by physicians, who must now admin ister alcohol pure, if at all. The phy sician prescription business has done much to keep prohibition from prohibiting in Maine, Iowa and Kansas. A large number of third and fourth class postmasters met at Chicago for the purpose of holding a national convention. The object of the meeting was to adopt means to influence Congressional action in behalf of the classes of postmas ters named, and for their relief from certain grievances under which they claim to suffer. There e 40,000 or 50,000 postmasters of these classes in the United States. They claim among other things that their pay is insufficient and that certain ex penses are unjustly put upon them. The convention appointed commit tees of arrangements to prepare pa pers for another national gathering, and decided that they would meet again in Chicago, on the loth of February. It was decided that the expenses necessary for the conven tion should be raised by a levy, of one dollar each on all third-class, and fifty cents on fourth-class post masters. 1 Ward B. Surface, who for a num- jber of years was city editor of the Dayton Journal yat at the time pf his death assistant telegraph editor of the Commercial Gazette of, Cin cinnati, died in Dayton on Satur day last from the result of injuries received in a quarrel at the saloon- kept by Charles Gilliland on Mark-1 et street, on Thursday. Surface and Gilliland, who struck the blow have in times past been fast friends, but two years ago the former be came infatuated with a waitress in the employ of the latter and . the two fell out. Since then, Surface has been most bitter in his enmity against Gilliland, and on Thursday, it is , said, went from Cincinnati with the express purpose of attack ing him. He entered the latter's saloon and at once began his tirade on both Gilliland and his family, whom he called all sorts of ugly names. - Gilliland, unwilling to take the abuse any longer) picked Hp a beer glass and threw it at Surface, strik ing him in the face. Surface stag gered and in falling his head struck the footrest of the bar, which caus ed the fatal injury. He was re moved to his brother's residence in the city, where he died Saturday. Surface went 'to Dayton -. from West Soiiora) Preble county, six years ago, and during his career oh the Journal developed into a brilli ant journalist. Whiskey and bad women finally took hold of him. and since, ne nas been running a sure race to ruin. For a time he tried to do better and succeeded, but he again reverted to his old habits, and it was during a state of intoxi cation that this difficulty occurr ed on Thursday. The cattle kings who have sought to occupy the public lands to the exclusion of other, people hav heard it announced from the court of last resort that they must go. Justice Miller, of the Supreme Court has just rendered adeeision on this matter which is of great importance It is on the celebrated Brighton ranch case, and involves the right of cattle kings to fence in Govern ment land. The Brighton Com pany has fenced in 25,000 acres of Government land in Custer County Neb., with fifty-seven miles of wire fence. Proceedings was begun some time ago to compel the company to remove the fence, and they have fought it desperately, carrying the case to the Supreme Court, in which they have been defeated Justice Miller's decision settles all doubt ful points on the question of fenc ing public domain, and this case will be used as a precedent in simi lar suits whenever they are brought The Brighton Company will have to immediately remove the fences and others will be compelled to do the same. On the land and Indian question, the administration is striking out in a new line in the in terest oi settlers against corpora tions in the one case and of the In dians against the jobbers other. in an- The committee appointed to wind up the affairs of the collapsed Freedman's bank report that they have paid in dividends all the mon ey available- except about $8,000. They have paid 62 cents on the dol lar. The commissioner renews his recommendation for the .relief by congress of the unfortunate-creditors of the institution, and adds The great majority of them are of the poorest and most illiterate of our people. Many of them have grown old and decrepit. It seems impossible for these people to real ize that they are to be deprived or have lost a portion of their earn ings, which years ago they labored so hard to acquire and save. Thousands of them to this day believe that the dividends paid them by the commissioner are but the interest on or earnings of their deposit, and that sooner or later their original deposits will be returned to them. No explanation seems to convince them to the contrary, and calls are made dail-, both orally and in writ ing, for their money. Nor ought it to be considered strange or unrea sonable in view of all the circum stances for these people to look to the government for reimbursement of their losses. General W. S. Rosecrans thinks that the military career of General Grant is subject to question and criticism. With that view, Rose crans lias Contributed an article to the North American Jiericw (De cember number), on "The Mistakes of Grant," in which he gives many new facts relating to the Army of the Cumberland while it was under his command. "Old Rosy" is rather severe in his little peroration, lie says : The principles and habits of a long life with me have against the obtrusion of personal views upon public attention ; but truth and jus tice require that upon historical events especially within my cogni zance, I should not in silence per mit insatiable and conscienceless egotism under the shadow of a great name to masquerade as the muse of history. ALL 

DEMOCRATS INVITED. The following general invitation has been issued by the Jackson club of Columbus to all Democrats desiring to attend the 8th of Janu ary celebration in that city : Deak Sir : Those having at heart the welfare of the Democratic party of Ohio and the perpetuation of its principles desire to have an annual gathering of her sons in the state on January 8, 1886, at the city hall in this city, that they may consult to gether, exchange views on public questions, and by toasts upon ap propriate topics by our leading jMid most eloquent men prepare for the duties of the coming- year. .You as a man of influence in your- partv arc cordially invited to attend and by your presence aid in the happy accomplishment ot the purposes oi the gathering.

Hoar, and which passed the Senate, will, it is generally con ceded, be taken up early in the pres ent session, and passed. . it pro vides that in case of death or disa bility of President and Vice Presi dent, then the Cabinet officers, . 'be ginning with Secretary of ' State hall assume and have lull power vested in the Executive. This is the only succession to the highest office in the government, that would insure peace and harmony, and it should be passed. The continuance of the New Or leans Exposition ot last year as an exposition of the trade of North and South America i3 a matter of congratulation. The exposition was opened on November 10th, and the rooms are in better condition now than at the opening of the prior exhibition. New Orleans- is the nearest largest port of entry to Central and South America, and its natural advantages and progressive spirit are giving it proniinenmas a competing commercial port'' The Government now sends the Central American mails by way of New Or leans instead oi byJNew York, as formerly.

The Sixty-seventh General Assembly convenes on Tuesday January 5, 1886. The will of Vice President Hen dricks is a model of brevity and good sense. There will be no wrang ling over it by attorneys. Here it is : "J, Thomas A. Hendricks of Marion county, Ind., do make this my last will and testament, hereby revoking an' and all wills by me at any time heretofore made. I give, bequeath and devise to my be loved wife, Eliza C. Hendrix, all my personal and real property of every description whatever, and wherever located, also my rights, claims, choses in action in fee simple to have the same to her and her heirs forever. In witness whereof, and, if agreeable to her, I desire that she shall be the executrix thereof.

[Salt Lake Tribune.] Many people are in the habit of studying the 'lasjt words ofyihg men, to see if,they indicate in what hannel the nund was running. Others, who' have deep religous Jae- iers, . Btuay aying words to, see , it irom tnem some glimpse into5 the profound beyond this life cannot be obtained. Without following either path, it seems to us that the last words of Vice President Hendricks were exactly the words which any old politician and statesman, or of any other over worked man of bb would, could he send a message back irom the other shore, return to tnis world. No more struggles : no more cares : no more defeats : no more hollow honors ; no more de lajTed hopes.. "I am free at last; send for Ji,liza. In eight brief words the tired . man, tired , unto death, : gave to the world notice that all its honors were as nothing ; that the only thing on earth worth the final cherishing of a man was home and the affections which make the real home a shrine. He must have felt that his supreme moment was at hand ; that he was free; but he wanted one more glance at the face of the woman who has been all and all to him through so many years ; the woman who has held up his hands when he was ready to faint ; who cheered him on, who, with abiding faith in her hus band and in herself, has always be lieved that "the greatest jwa s be hind;", no wonder when the calm of the grave began to steal over him and he felt that he was "free at last," he wanted the brave wife near him. No thought of the hon ors that were his came to mm then : no thoughts of the hard fights that he had lost and won ; no thoughts of what might be, could life be spared to him for a few years more Only over him stole the ineffable peace of the eternal rest into which he was sinking, and the only wish was: that she who for forty years had been his better half might be near. In such a death the American home receives its fullest vindication and the sacred name of wife takes on new dignity and new honor. Ambition may be satiated or out lived ; the highest triumphs may lose their enchantment ; the strug gle tor tame or sold may at last be come a burden. "Then there is noth ing left except the sacred circle of home and the affections which give to home their charm. It is only there that the tired man may turn and leel that he is free at last ; the great world for him contracts to that little circle and there the mira cle ef babyhood is repeated for him as loving voices make a lullaby, in listening to which unconsciously he sinks into his final sleep. Dissatisfaction of Labor. [Cincinnati Telegram.] Almost daily the accounts of la bor troubles arising from a strike are to be met with in the public press, and there is a constant un rest on the part of thoughtful men, as they survey the field with great solicitude. Wages go down, while wealth increases, and thisis a fact that puzzles staticians. What will the future bring forth, if now with a population of 58,000,000 there is such a despondent feeling, and measures are not adopted to re move the existing troubles. Labor creates wealth, and it not only multiplies the sources of wealth, but furnishes happiness to all classes of men. To labor we owe all we possess ; it has built vessels which navigate the waters of the globe, it has stretched the thou sands of mile's of wire which ex tend throughout the length and breadth of our land, and which are buried beneath - the waves of the ocean ; it has built the iron high ways upon which the locomotive speeds the car which transfers our products and return our necessities, and in fact all we have, and all we enjoy is due to the labor of our people. Now what does labor de mand? What doos it need? What does it deserve? The questions are easily answered, and but two words are necessary, and the an swer is, fair wages. In the United States the laborer is a citizen, he has the ballot, and in course of time he will use his right and speak through the ballot box his views and demand his rights. He is willing to labor, even toil for those things which are necessary to his comfort and happiness, and he will have them sooner or later. The American laborer wishes a house, not a hut. He wants to pro vide for his family, clothe, feed and educate them, at least, and as they acquire an education their desires, and rational ones they be, increase. The men of labor in the United States have a majority, and if they will but unite in securing the de sired ends the question will be speedily settled. We have said that what he wants is, "fair wages," and as to what these are we will venture to reply : Such an amount as will enable' him to live in com fort, and as are necessary to ob tain the necessaries of life without stint, and the same time without extravagance. Lesson of History. New York Sun. Of the two men elected President and Vice President in 1 j76, one still lives, conspicuously honored and warmly beloved, theirst citizen of the land, after having twice refused a nomination that meant the sure righting, in a measure, of the wrong which the Democracy suffered in his person nine years ago. The oth er dies in the office from which he was shut out by the conspirators of the Fraud. Honored and sincerely mourned by the nation, he is . car ried to-day to his last resting place. Of the two men who profited chieily by the monstrous iniquity, one is already forgotten who knows where Wheeler is, or whether he lives or sleeps in oblivion? The oth er crawls out of obscurity to touch the hem of Hendricks' shroud, hap py thus to attract lor an hour even the attention of universal contempt. No Need of a Quarrel. [New York Sun.] seems to be some appre hension among' some Democrats, as "there is a vivid hope among Republicans,- that a conflict vnl be precipitated" somehow or j other between the President and his par ty in the present Congress. The prophets of evil think, or pretend to think, that the irritation against the President, of which there are sporadic local symptoms, . will break out virulently when the flood gates of talk are opened at Wash mgton this month. -Now, of course nobody can tell what the President mav do or what Congress mav do ; but it should be borne in mind that love for compe tent examinations, unsatisfactory distribution of offices and delay in distributing them are the only causes of onence yet manitest m Mr. Cleveland. None of these things is matter for the Democrats in Congress to make row about. The competitive examinations are pre scribed by a statute which cannot now be repealed, and the delay may be a little disappointing, but sooner or later, and on the whole pretty soon, the oflices will be in Demo cratic hands ; and as to the appoint ments already made, it is absurb to suppose that anybody but the Re publicans want to be disagreeable about them. Take out a few Mug wump appointments, given for sup posed value received, and Mr. Cleve land's appointments have been Democratic. In a few notable in stances the party would have pre ferred other Democrats than those he selected, but as long as the Presi dent appoints Democrats, and not Republicans, his party is not going to quarrel about him. lhat he has stepped on the toes of a number of Congressmen is very probable, but Congressmen with sore toes will keep to themselves if they have any sense of propriety. This matter of the offices, impor tant as it is, is, alter all, a minor one. The Democratic part' has no inten tiori and the Democrats in the 49th Congress can have no intention of quarreling with the President about offices. The Republicans have the patent for doing that sort ot thing, 1 hat the Democrats in Congres will disagree with some of the Pres ident's recommendations is as like iy as that he will object to some de tails of their legislative work. Disa greements of this kind are ineviti: ble.- They have frequently occurred between Republican Csngi esses and Republican Presidents. Ihcy arc not fatal or even dangerous. They are differences of opinion, not quar rels. There will be grave differences of opinion among the Democrats in the next Congress, but we hope they will be able to get along without quarreling e-ther among themselves or with the President. With the Re publican Senate they may have to quarrel. . In an interview lately held with Roscoe Conkling he said,, among other things : - "The Republican party has been dragged down to its present low stage by the manipulations of one man, whose overwhelming ambition for the Presidential seat led him to go to all lengths to accomplish his life-long dream and ambition. He wrecked a President by his manip ulation in forcing him to make ap pointments that lead to a disruption of the party he performed acts to attain his end for his own advance ment that even high Heaven would protest against ; he practiced venal ity to that extent that it became a proverb, and still remains a hissing among the good men 01 the party and of the whole land ; but he has his reward. He has been relegated to that privacy that should have been his lot eight years ago. His adherents have admitted since the last election that they were . hood winked, and many men who are of high political standing have stated to me that they rued the day that thev aided him in what they now call his unholv sc-homes. Poor com fort have they obtained from. him. These parties arc now enraged at finding their hopes blasted, and in veigh as heavilv against their one ime hilarious Plumed Knight as they were heartily and conspicu ously shouting his praise a year aso.
