WILL FARMERS LEARN? iS The willingness of employes in the western shoe factories to take lower wages is reported, with a result of business activity ir this trade being shifted from New England to the west. This appears to be an Instance where certain classes of wage earners have been able to comprehend the reasons for their unemployment, and have taken a direc step for the re covery of the business which would help their jobs. If this vision of the actual situation could impress Itself upon all labor, the conditions in this cnuntry, and In fact thruout the world, Y-ould change promptly for the better. Just as soon as labor everywhere roaches this common ground of un derstanding and agrees to greater ef ficiency at reduced wages, which means larger production at lower costs, the whole industrial machine will spring into normal activity. The farmer's present condition of price-deflation but not of debt-deflation also has its direct bearing on the prosperity of the entire country. After all, the farmer represents the greatest single buying class In the United States; virtually half the con suming power of the country rests on him. The farmer is postponing pur chases now, not because of anyftvil ful refusal to buy, but because of his limited financial ability, due partly to his wilful refusal to sell at high prices when he had the opportunity. The story is told of a Missouri farmer who said a few days ago: "I priced a hat for myself and it was $7.50. That meant 37 bushels of corn, a full wagon load. The hat I have on cost me four bushels.- It will have to last thru the. winter." , The farmer, rebelling against con ditions, has allowed himself to be mis led by the politicians, and instead of getting his representatives to under take some reform which will benefit him, has been led in exactly the op posite direction. Freight rates add to the cost of manufacture, and so also do taxes. Freight costs will be re duced by drastic reduction in the cost of railway labor. Wages and rates should,, of course, be considered to gether. Tho tax costs of the country are most heavily borne by business, nc-t tlons in the tilts which it absorbs. but In the restriction in the use of capital which heavy surtaxes impose. Capital will not take business chances of loss which It has to bear alone, when a huge percentage of profit is forfeited to the government. The cost of doing business, includ ing heavy taxes, is added to the cost of things which the farmer buys, and provisions for a low percentage tax, widely distributed, would materially reduce the prices of such things. And yet the farmers' representatives stand for keeping taxes high, and by con trolling the vote the agricultural bloc has been instrumental in defeating real tax reform, with the result that the present law is as bad for the farmers as for every other individual in the country, whether he pays taxes or not. Howat and his followers now are between two fires. On one side are the courts and on the other is the na tional organization of miners. Tho national executive board dealt the outlaws the most severe blow they yet have received when it ordered the Il linois officers to stop collecting dues to pay benefits to the strikers. When their pay stops most of the fight will be taken out of the strike leaders. Deprived of leadership the miners probably will return to work. 

HENRY FORD'S RAILROAD. Walker I. Hines, former director general of railroads, and at one time chairman of the board of the Santa Fe railroad, says that it is contrary to the public Interest for a large ship per like Henry Ford to own and oper ate a railroad by means of' which he has a powerful leverage for obtaining special consideration from the corn men carriers of the country. "But as long as this is permitted by law," he says in the December Na tion's Business, "we can at least con gratulate ourselves that the D. T. & I. railroad is in the hands of a genius, who is willing to turn his railroad into a laboratory for the making of experiments which his resourcefulness suggests. I shall be surprised if some of the experiments do not turn out to be valuable from the standpoint of railroad companies in general." After Ford took over the ownership and management of the Detroit, To ledo & Ironton railroad and switched the traffic of his large Industry to that lne, much was made of his abil ity to reduce expenses and increase traffic Income. The inference was drawn that any other road. If man aged by Ford or in the manner in which he managed his road, could do as well. Development of facts, it seems, shows that Ford's management of the road was not such as could be adopted by all roads. In the first place, owners of other roads did not own large manufacturing plants whose purchases of raw material! and sales of manufactured goods coufd be diverted to their own lines. More over, Ford used the leverage of his own shippin; business to Induce other roads to favor his In routing ship ments. This, obviously, could not be done generally. But ther is an equally important disclosure in connection with the working rules which other roads were compelled to observe but from which Ford's road was free. Under the na tional agreements adopted under the McAdoo regime, each class of work must be dona by an employe who be longed to a union of that class. However capable a man might be of doing the work, h i would not be per mitted to do it if it belonged to some other class of employes. Further more, thnre was an understanding as to the number of men who must be assigned to certain work, with the re sult that often men were standing idle for no useful purpose. The roads were required to pay the men for checking in and out as they went to and from their work. These rules. It appears, did not ap ply on Ford's road. If anything went wrong with an engine, the engineer or fireman fixed it if he could. The fireman would get down and turn a switch if no switchman were handy, and would fix the switch if it got out of order. While the men are on duty on the Ford road, they put in their time doing anything that needs to be done and which they are capable of doing. The station agent is permitted to do odd jobs of carpentering around the building, or paint it. The railroad labor board has abro gated many of the senseless and wasteful rules adopted by the Mc Adoo period of management, and, presumably, the roads and the public are to bo relieved of burdens which did nobody good. Mr. Ford's road will still have the advantage of pri a'ely controlled traffic, but It will not have so large an advantage in , working conditions. The action of the railroads In re ducing passenger rates for the holi days is not entitled to be construed Into a Christmas gift to the public. It is In fact a recognition of the prin ciple that a big business at a small profit is better than a small business at a big profit. Railroad passenger business has suffered greatly from ex cessive rates. The lower tariffs of fered doubtless will bring some of the Idle rolling stock into use. The advance In the price of liberty bonds is attributed by the Wall Street Journal to heavy purchases made by the banks. It appears that the bank ers foresaw a reduction in interest rates and hastened to put their money into securities the interest rate on which promised to be-permanent. If anybody have a better explanation let him bring it forward. International Sunday School Lesson BI WTLIilAM T. EXIJS. For December 11 Is, "Paul Writes to a Friend" Philemon 1:1-25. Bedrock on the Social Iroblcm. Like a long arm reached out to all the world, thrusting vast problems under tho eyes of every nation, the Washington conference on limitation of armament and problems of the Pacific has aroused peoples every where to the gravity and the acuteness of certain great issues. The vast con cerns of peace and right and fraternity have had first-page position in the press of the whole earth. The educa tional value of this wide-spread pre sentation, and consequent discussion of vkal themes is one of the ways in which democracy works out its will. Now into the thick of this interest, with that timeliness which seems nothing less than providential, Is pro jected this Sunday school lesson which many millions will study. The text is one of the shortest books of the BJble, the letter to Philemon, a wealthy Christian of Colossae, written by Paul, from his prison in Rome, and sent by the hand of Onesimus, a runaway slave belonging to Philemon, who had be come a Christian under the apostle's teaching. In this brief persona.1 epist'e of six hfindred words, so tender and inti mate, that it has often been called Paul's love letter, we find combined an industrial problem, a social problem, a criminal problem, an ethical problem and a religious problem and a solu tion for them all. The Runaway's Romance. No cold blooded, impersonal, theo logian was this veteran preacher, traveler, statesman, the apostle Paul, whom we here find a prisoner In Rome. As an oriental wine-skin drips good wine wherever it is pricked, so the life of Paul, wherever touched, bleeds rich, red, human interest. How full of personal greetings are even his most philosophical writings. We know that nothing could ever keep him from his life work of presenting Jesus Christ to people. So we are scarcely surprised to lerirn, that along with the soldiers and other persons who found their way to the prisoner's presence to talk over the new faith, there was a runaway slave from Colossae named Onesimus a word that means "help ful" or "profitable," and one upon which a pun is made in the letter be fore us. Rome, with its unspeakable slums, was the haven of the runaway slaves of an empire. The larger part of the city's population was made up of these miserable creatures. Young and ad venturous Onesimus got to Rome, and probably encountered hard times.' In some way he learned of the famous Christian preacher, Paul, as a prisoner in the city. He recalled him as a be loved and honored guest in the home of his master, Philemon, the Christian, of Colossae. Any face associated with home would be dear to the suffering exile, and so the runaway sought for Paul, and found him a friend and a father, and under bis gentle guidance became himself a Christian, a member of the same household of faith as hi master. That big fact settled several prob lems indeed, conversion to Christianity is the great settler of all problems. Now that he had become a Christian, Onesimus was obliged to do what was right. By the laws of the time, and by the prevailing ethics, he belonged to Philemon, and must return. Right eousness is always retroactive, and calls for restitution. True the slave was useful to Paul and he belonged to the new brotherhood; but still, right was right, and he" could never have peace or joy in his religion until he had returned to his legal master. Back to 'Bondage. Like a faded letter found In an attic trunk, that gleams and glows with all the fire of a living passion so this little epistle of Paul to Philemon seems still to throb with the pulsation of warm blood from a beating heart. He loved Onesimus. for the young man, in gratitude and affection, lav ished service and loyalty upon the lonely old prisoner. He also loved Philemon, the spendid Christian gen tleman, memory of whose hospitality brightened the darkness of the Roman imprisonment:. He also loved Christ supremely, and he wanted to heed the claims of all three loves. So, in phrases that stiil repeat them selves, in the letters of friends to friends, Paul sent Onesimus back to Philemon "No longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a brother beloved." He did not deny the master's right to own the slave; but like his Master, who put himself in the sinner's place, 1 Paul could write, "If then thou count est me a partner, receive him as my self. But if he hath wronged thee at all, or owest thee aught, put that to mine account." j It would be less fair to forget that, even in the days of American slavery, masters and slaves were often both . Christians, dwelling together In mu tual affection. Onesimus was going! back to bondage tho the system of; slavery received its death knell with the coming of the gospel of liberty but Paul's reasoning was that this re lationship between owner and slave was to be transformed by the higher relationship of both to their mutual Master, Christ. A bad system op erated in a Christian spirit, may pro duce better results than an ideal sys tem operated by un-Christlan motives. "The will to peace" means more than the enactments of an international ; conference. i Down to Bed Rock. j In the heart-beats of this brief let ter from an aged prisoner to a die-! tant friend concerning a runaway i slave whom a Roman gentleman would ordinarily scarcely have deigned to notice we may hear the music of the new era when our social and in dustrial and political problems will have been solved. For Paul's thesis is that loyalty to a common Christ supersedes all lesser relationships and obligations. When two persons, both sincerely want to do the will of Jesus there will be no clash between them on' account of class or social distinc tions. The world is going to find stability at bed rock only by accept ing as supreme the will of the Lord. The longer I observe life the more deeply am I impressed with the com prehensive practicability of the Chris tian Endeavor pledge, "Trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ for strength, I promise Him that I will strive to do whatever He would like to have me do." We may be sure that the relations between Philemon and Onesimus were solved by the consistent application of this higher law, the will of God. That is the only law that will settle our present world problems. The diplomats seem not to know It tho millions of common folk do but the clear and simple way out of the tangled jungle of our times Is that of loyalty to a Master who loves all ana would have all live together in com mon welfare and oeace.

At a recent luncheon given to a bride-to-be each of the women present was invited to tell why she married the man she did, or why she wished to get married, or why Bhe married the second time, according to whether she had tie husband, or had had two husbands, or was looking for a hus band. If the ladies told the truth, and really got down to brass tacks about their individual cases, it must have been a most interesting: experience meeting, particularly as regarded the matrimonial repeater. The question: "Why did I marry the man I did?" is one that every wo man asks herself with varying inflec tions, and to which she gives a dif ferent answer according to the state of the matrimonial barometer. When the weather is fair and sunny, and hubby is wafting hot air in her direc tion she is sure she married him be cause he was the Only Alan in the world for her. But when the domestic skies' are lowering, when husband growls over ths bills, and is disgruntled, and un reasonable, she opines tthat the only explanation for her having married that particular man was because the fool killer was loafing on the job, and not attending to business the day she two-stepped with him to the altar. Why anybody marries anybody else is a conundrum that keeps everybody guessing, as you may learn by attend ing any wedding. The strains of the bridal march are never quite loud enough to drown out the chorus that swells from every throat of: "For pity's sake! Is that the bridegroom? What in the name of heaven do you suppose she ever saw In him to make her want to marry him? Looks like a scared rabbit trying to swallow his Adam's apple, while he steps on his own feet. I know men are scarce, but it does seem as if she could have shut her eyes, and run her hand in the grab-bag and pulled out something else than that!" - , "And what do you suppose made him pick out Mabel for a wife? My dea,r, she is three years older than he is, and she is that made up I bet she wouldn't recognize her own face if she saw it in a mirror after it was washed clean. Worse still she is one of the vivacious kind that would give me nervous prostration in two days, imagine having to listen to her eiesle. and exclaim, and have hysterics, and wonder, and joy, and delight for the balance of your life! Funny how people mary, isn't it? Wonder what makes them choose each other out of a whole world full of people that look as if they would have suited them so much better." And the answer is:- "Search me." The question, Why do women marrv a second time? was cynically answered a long time ago by Ioctor Johnson who said that a second marriage was the ultimate triumph of hope over experience.

SECOND THOUGHT BY JAY E. HOUSE (From Philadelphia Public Ledger.) In Which the People Rush to the lies cue. Sir So some guy says you're a hick. That is the compliment su preme- Ain't it funny bow the wise guys are always worKing- for hicks: What a hick Abraham Lincoln would have seemed to one of these bell-bot tomed pants wise boys! He had his neck shaved! Does Edison toddle ' The poor chump! Didn't this genera tion discover sex? You thought Eve did. You're wrong. No one ever heard of it until the present genera tion appeared on the seems. Beh Jonson was always off pitch on the soup. Wonder how a clover kicker such as he got his name in the books? Ho, hum! i. JJ. Sirs Again, if on my return from a Canadian hunting trip 1 should read that some eastern contributor had called you a hick, then, oh, then would I know that, during my absence you had crowned him with an other wise unanswerable remark. A. R. W. We had despaired of getting a rise out of the "Hahvahd "old grads," but Beekman Morris finally has obliged. Writing in the Harvard Alumni Bui letin in reference to certain observa tions that have appeared herein, he says: "I believe this oreamic manl Testation too largely typical of anti- Harvard sentiment latent in many lo calities. Anti-Harvard is the only way to refer to this sort of thing, which is hardly predicated on sportsmanship, breeding or fair-mindedness, or worth the attention which honest criticism commands, whether made by gentle men or others." Further along Mr. Morris observes that he doesn't care what "any of the self-enlisted Harvard haters say, think or do. A time ago, when we were "kid ding" Harvard and Yale about their respective football schedules, we had occasion to discuss the matter with a Harvard man. "You may be able, he saidV "to sting the Yale 'old grads' to acerbetic retort, but no Harvard man will fall for it. They're too smart." We shall now proceed to col lect the small wager made at the mo ment the matter was in controversy. To us, the curious tiling about a Harvard man :s his belief that there are "Harvard haters" and "anti-Har vard sentiment latent in many locali' ties." Why, we pause to inquire; why the self-consciousness? We came out of the corn lands, where a Harvard man is a good deal of a curiosity, but we never knew a 'Harvard hater" or one who entertained latent sentiment antipathetic to that university. In 1894 we assisted, up to our capacity to do so in the etection of a Harvard man as district attorney of Marianna county. Later, we occupied, for eight een years, a stall adjacent to the one in which a Harvard man did his browsing. We rubbed elbows with him every day and found him entirely human. As becomes one whose "prep" school was a potato patch and whose alma mater was a cornfield, we have no prejudice against any university. But it is rather pleasant to De in position where one Is not compelled, or ex pected, to kiss any of them. He's Doing It," Too. Sir Your latest defi relative to your apparent susceptibility on the proposi tion offered by the Macksville Enter prise intrigues me. Some time ago I suggested an easy way out by laying claim to Edward Bok's offer of a cash gratuity to the person doing the greatest service to Philadelphia. I offered the subtle sug gestion that you quit your job, an 1 thus automatically become the re cipient of Mr. Bok's generosity. I do not know if this Macksville Enterprise thing is a creature of your imagination, but if I were you I would not spurn the offer. If you gain a vote of confidence after your defi. then Barnum sure did under-estimate the crop. Are you under any obligation to Cul len Cain that you grant him free ad vertising space, or is it just a "brother act" to "kid" the boss? And, by the way. did you mean it when you proclaimed "1 f Winter Comes" the best book of tbe year, or was that another one of your "jokes"? You'll remember me. J. R. I. Of course, we remember J. R. I. He is the chappie who wanted Hon. Dempsey to stop his training lon enough to 'come up from Atlantic City and slap the column's face off. When we suggested that J. R. I. substitute for Hon. Dempsey, he declined the commission. Of course, we remember him. As for the balance of it. we hope we shall always be found boost ing for gentlemen who are as sane, clean, straightforward, kindly and courteous as Cullen Cain. However. J. R. I. would miss the column more than he thinks. One who peruses it so closely and per sistently that he recalls paragraphs which appeared herein months ago is in no position to give the column up. We have no opinion as to the Hon. Ruth's place in the firmament of vaudeville. It is all right with us if he knocks em dead. But if he 13 knocking 'em dead, why the herculean effort to make it appear that he is doing so? As we have indicated, 'we haven't seen the Hon. Ruth's act. That is one ordeal wa Intend to spare ourself. But his publicity is as fictitious as its hero. George Matthew Adams Daily Talk
