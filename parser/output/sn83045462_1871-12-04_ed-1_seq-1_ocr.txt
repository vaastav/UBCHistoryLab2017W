I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty nljuded to which has been concluded, since the adjournment of Congress, w.th her Britanic Haje rty, and a eopv ot the prutoeals of the ?on ferences of the <>nsi?,*sioiur? by whom it was aepotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending between th? iwo nations. \ ?ncn? ?inestton* are to be adjnsted by arbitra tion, 1 recommend Congress at an early day to make the necessary prevision for the Tribunal at Uen?v?. at>d for the several commissions on the part of the United State* called tor by the Treaty. Hi* Majesty the King ot Italy, President of the Swis- Confederation, and His Majesty the K m| eror of rirnzil, hare each consented, on the joint reuuest of the powers, to name an arbitra tor for the tribunal of Geneva. 1 have caused my flank* to t-e suitably expressed for the rea diness with which the joint request has been complied with by the appolatm-nt of gentlemen -ef i miuence and learning to these important po sit <OD*. His Majesty the Emperor of Germ-?nv has been pleased to comply wtth the joint re?i lest or the two gCT? rnineut?, and has consented to act a? the arbitrator of the disputed water bo indiry bet w. en the United States and Ureat Britain. The contracting parties in the Treaty have undertaken to regard as between themselves, certain principle* of public law, for which tbe 1'sited States have contended from the com mencement ot their history. They have also agreed to bring those principles to the knowledge of the otTier Maritime Powers, and to inv e them to accede to them. Negotiations are go in* on as to the form ot tbe note by which the invi tabou is to be extended to the other Pearers. I recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United State* to bring iute operation the Articles ot the Treaty relating to the Fish eries, and to the other matters touching the re lations of the United States towards the Britisli Xorth American possessions, to become operat ive *> soon as the proper legislation shall be had the part ?f Great Britain and its possessions It is much to be desired that this legislation may become operative before the fishermen ot the t mted States begin to make their arrange ments for the coining season. 1 ha ve uddrt ssed a communication, of which a coiiy is trar emitted herewith, to the Goverturn of New York. Pennsylvania, ?)hio, Indiana, Mulligan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, urging upon the governments of those States respectively the wfs>*rj action on their part tocarrv intoett'eet the object of the article of the treaty which contemplates the use of the canals. on either side, connected with the navigation ol fhe I akes and river* forming the boundary, ?>* terms of euuality by the inn abitants of "both < ounfrits.

It hae twen made the agreeable duty of the raited States, to preside over a conference at Washington, betwen the plenipotentiaries of Spain, and the allied South American Hepub '*?' which has resulted in an armistice with the reasonable assurance of a tiermanenl peace. The intimate friendly relations which have so lo?g existed l>etweea the L'nited States and Hussia continue undistarbed. The visit of the third mob o* the toperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his govern ment to diminish tfce cordiality M those relations.

The * abinet of the Ml kado has of thelart session of Congress, selected ?iti/em of the United SUtes to serve in >ilk ces of importance in several departments of government. I have reason to thiah that this ?eleKCion is doe to an appreciation of the di?in ferestedness of the policy which the United Strtes have pursued towards Japan.

WASHINGTON. D. C.. MONDAY. this government to ?werve from Its establish* 1 sourse. Prompted by a [de?ire to put an end to t??c baiborous treatment of oar shipwrecked Sailors on the Coreu Const, I instructed oar Minister *t Peking to endeavor to conclude a couven -io? wrtii Core* for securing the safety ami liu i- ane treatment of such mariner". Admiral t.vxljrrr* m- instructed to accompany him with ? sum cent force to protert him in caee of need, a -mall survey ng party ami out, on reach ing the coast. was treacherously attacked at a disadvantage. Ample opportunity was given for explaua*. M and apology for the insult. Ne'ther came. A force was then landed. After an arduous m irch nveT a rugged and tlifllcilt country the l'orts from which the outrage bad been committed were ri dnced by n gallant assault, and were de stroyed. H.c. ii.g thus minified the criminals. :<nd having vindicated the honor of the flag, the exp?ditnni returned, tinding it impracticable, undertlie circumstances, to conclude the de i sired convention. I respectfully refer to the I corresjiojidence relating thereto herewith sub mitted. aud leave the subject ior such action as I Congress may see tit to talce. The Kepnbllc of Mexico has not yet rfp??l(Ml the very objectionable law? establishing what is known ?- the '? Free Zone" on the frontier of the I'nited States. It i? hoped that this may yet Is done, and also that more -tringent m anures tnir be taken by that ItepuMlc for restraining law Us* persons on its frontiers. I hope that >lexico. %y its own act.ou. will soon relieve this Government of tfte difficulties experienced trom these caiises. <>nr relations with the various republics of Central and South America continue, wlta the one exception, to be cordial aud friendly. I recommend some action by Congress regard log t^e overdue installments under the award of tae Venezuelan claim* commission of 14G6. l bs Internal distention* of this government presents no just meat ion for the absence of effort to aeet their toiemn treaty obligations. The ratification or an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has been exchanged. It is a subject for congratulation that th? great empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory step tow arils the abolition of slavery. Our relations w ith that empire, aiw avs cordial, will naturally b< made more ?o by this aet. It i- not too mucii to hope that the government of Brazil may here after hud it te its interest, as well as intrinsi cally right, to advance toward entire emancip^ tion more rapidly than the present act contem plates. The trne prosperity an1 greatness of a nation '? to be found in the elevation and education of its laborers. It is a subject tor regret that the reform- in this direction, which were volunta rily promised by the statesmen of Sp?in, have i not been carried out in its West India Colonies The laws and regulations for the apparent ab olition of slavery in Cuba and Porto Kioo leave most or the laborers in bondage, with no hope of release until their lives become ? burden to their employers. 1 desire to direct your attention to the fact that., citizens of the I'nited States, or persons claiming to be citizens of the United Stat< % are large holders in foreign lau<ls of this species of property, forbidden by the fundamental law of their alleged country. I recommend to Con gress to provide by stringent legislation, a suit i able remedy against the holding, owning, or dealing In slaves, or being interested in slave property in foreign land*, either as owners, hirers, or mortgagers, by citizen* of the United States. It is to be regfttted that the disturbed condi tion of the Island of Cuba continues to be a s nrce of annoyance and of anxiety. The ex i tenceof a protracted struggle in such close proxhnity to our own territory, without apparent i prospect of an early termination, cannot be i other than an object of concern to a j?eople who, ; while abstaining from interference in the affairs of ether powers, naturally desire to see everv country in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty, and the blessing* of free Institutions. Our naval onmmanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it should Income necessary, to spare no effort to i protect the lives and property of bona tide Am-r ican citizens, aud to maintain the dignity of the I flag. It to ho|ied that all pending questions with Spain growing out of the affairs in Cuba, may I be adjusted in the spirit of peace and concilia r tion which has hitherto guided the two Powers in their treatment of sucn questions. To give importance and to add to the effici ency of our diplomatic relations with Japsn 1 and China, and to further aid in retaining the good opinion of those peoples, and to secure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between those nations aud the t balance of the commercial world, 1 earnestly i recommend that an appropriation be made to support at least foar American youths in each f nf those countries, to ser\e as a part of the ot i filial family of our ministers there. Oar i repres* ntatives would not even then be f plae -d upon an equality with the representatives i of Great Britain and of some other powers. As t row situated, our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and trans lators upon natives of those countries wlio know our language imperfectly, or procure, for the > occasion, the services of employees in foreign business houses or the interpreters to other for eign ministers. I would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of supporting the American lines of steamers now plying between San Francisco and .lapan and China, and the Australian line? n'mcst our only reniaimug lines of ocean steam ers? and of increasing their services. The national debt has been reduced to tho > extent of eighty-six millions, tirty-seven thou ' sand one hundred and twenty-six dollars and ' eighty cents duriug the year, and by the nego tiation of national bonds, at a lower rate ot ia~ 1 t-rt??: the ir t-reet on the public debt has been so far llmlnl?bed, that now the snm to be raised ' tor the intere-t account 1? nearly seventy mil 1 on* ot dollars less than on the 1st of karcb. 1*?. It was highly desirable that this rapid dimu I nitkin should t*ke place, both to strengthen the > red.tot the oountry and to convince its citizens ot their entire ability to meet every dollar of lia ' bility without bankrupting them. Bat In view i ef the accomplishment of thsse desirable ends i of the rapid development of the resources of the ' country, its increasing ability to meet large de i mat >is. and the smount already paid, it is not ' desirable that the present resources of the l country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid payment. I, therefore, re ? comiu? nd a mod.tica?lon of both the tariff and ' internal tax laws. 1 recommend that all taxes from internal sources be abol ished except those collected from spirituous, ? vinous and malt liquors, tobacco in its vario us 1 losms, and from stamps. I n rea Ijustng the tiriff, I sugge-t that a carc tul estimate l?e made of the amount of surplus revenue collected under the present laws, after providing for the current expense* of the tl ov en: mtnt.the interest account and a sinking fun 1, and that thi? surnlus be redneed in such a m in ner ?s to afford tke greatest relief to the greatest number. 1 Ther. are nianv articles not produced at home, ! but which enter largely info general consump tion through articles which are manufactured at home, such as medicines com|>nnmled, Arc., Ac., fit m which very little revenue is derived, * bnt which enter into geuernl n?e. A'.l such ar tieUsI recommend to be placed on the "free list." Should a further reduction prove advisa ble, 1 would then recommend that it be m ide upon th<we articles which can best bear it, with out disturbing home production or reducing the wages of American labor. 1 have not entered into figures, because to do so, would be to repeat what will be laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treaii ury. * ^ The present laws for collecting revenue pay Collectors of Customs small salariea,-but pro vide for moitiea. (shares in all seixures) which, at principal porta of entry particularly, raise the compensation of those officials to a larce turn. *????? if this svstem mast, at times, work pernietotuily. It holds oat an induoemant to dishonest men. Should such get poesemson of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered to enable them finally to make large soisares. Year attention is re spectfully Invited to this subiaot. Continued fluctuations In the value of gold ae compared with the national currency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and de vetoometit of the country In keeping us prices of all articles necessary in every-day Uft. It festers a spirit of gambling prejudicial alike to national morals and the national finances. It the question can be met as to haw te give a Axed value to onr oa. ? ney.that valneconstantly aad unifornily approaching par with specie, a very desirable object wfll be gained.

It is the index t.f the growth of education and of the prosp^rryot the people, two el-wnents highly conducive to the vigor andStability of repnblica. With a vast territory, like oui s, much of it spars- ly populated, but all re.tun ing the S'.rvtc< a of the mail, it ia not at present to be expected that this department can be made sell ru'taintng. But a gradual approach to this end, from veer to tear, is confidently reliei on, and tb> day ia not far distant when the Post Oflice Depart inent of tlie government will prove a much greater blessing to tne whole peojvl* Irian it ia now. The snggeMums of the Postmaster General for improvements in the department presided over by him are earnestly recommended to ynur special attention. gspecia'ly do I recommend fa vorable consideration of the plan for uni ting the telegraphic system of the United States with the postal sysUm. It is believed that, by ? nch a cor rse. the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced, and the service as well, it n ?t bat ter reudercd. It would secure the fui*lv>r advan tage of tending the telegraph through portions ot the country where private enterprise will not con struct it. Commerce, trade, and above all. the ef forts to bring a people widely separatt d into a o>ia iiiunity ot inierest. are always benefitted by a rapid intercommunication. . , .... Education. the ground work of republican inst tu tit ns. is encouraged by increasing the facilities to gather speedv news from all *arts of the country. The desire to reap the benefit of snch Improve meets will stimulate education.

A fu.l report of what baa been done under this law will be submitted to Congress bv the Attorney General, In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbari-m repugnant to civilization to de. ency and to the taws of the United Btates.

Tbisisa suggestion onl) and not a reconiaiendation. The policy jinrsued ton afd the Indiana has resulted favorably, so far as c*u bs judged fiotn the limited t.uie during which It has b er in operation. Through the exertioiis of the v:t rious societies of Ghris'iatis, to whoui has been entrusted the execution of the policy, ami the Hoard of Commissioners, authorized by the law of Aptil 10. 1MO, many tribes or Indians ha*e been induced to settle upon reservations. t> cultivate the soil, to periorui productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They are being cared for in snch a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habits or life to embrace the only opportu ult v which is left them to avoid extermination I'recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy, not onlv because It is humane. Christian-like, and economical, but because it is right. 1 recommen d to your favorable consideration also the policy of granting a territorial govern ment to th* Indians in the Indian territory west or Arkansas and Miseoari and south of Kansas. In doing so every right guarantied to the India* by treaty should be secured. Such a course might, in tim*, b* th* mean* of collecting most or th* Indiana now between th* Missouri and the Pacific and south of th* British possessions into on* Territory or one Stat*. Th* S*cr*tary of th* Interior has tr**t*d up*n thi* subject at length, and I commend to yon his ansgntll.

U PORr OF I III HWRCTABT Of 1I(E 1UUKIBY. The country has been prosperous durinx the year now closing; fciul the public lirmwt'.* have {?bared in the general pro?;>erity. During the fiscal year ending June 30,157!, the reduction o! the public det-t w.ic tzHJoX. 7C4.S4. The total decrease in the pub ic debi frt m Maieh 1, IHS, to ltfwmlxr 1,1811, was $277,211.??fl'i.HS: and daring the same period the annual int? rest charge has been reda ed #16, 741.4.;G<>4. The Secretary says : ?*Ttse revenues for the year 1 *71, and the re ct ip?s since the f.?st of .luly last, show that the time has arrived when a considerable further re duction in taxes can bo made, and yet leave the government in a position to pay at least filly mil lions of dollars annually of the principal of the public debt, including the amount pledged through ti e sinking fund. In my aunual rej>ort to Congress, tor 1870,1 expressed the opinion that the st tt It d policy of the country should contemplati a revenue sufficient to meet the ordtnary ex penses of the government, pay the interest on the public debt, and from twenty-live to fifty millions of dollars of the principally annually To that opinion I adhere, with even a stronger conviction that the payment annually u|?on the principal of the public debt should not be less than tit ty millions of dollars. Large as the revenues ol the country have been during the last three years, our system of tax ation has not been oppressive to individuals, nor has it in any sensible degree embarrassed the business of the country: and while relief from taxation is desirable it is y et more desirable t>> maintain the public credit in its pr?.-ent eleva ted position, not only as an example to other nations, but for its historical value in enabling the government to make loans for large p.mount*upon favorable terms if. uiihapi>ily,Ti> the future an exigency should require such loan to be made. The power to nege *iate a large loan at live per eent. interest, and t<. enter upon negotiations tbi the sale of bonds bearing five, four-and-a-half, and four .per cent, interest, is derived eatireU from the exhibition of an honest pur|>ose on tlie 1 ait of the |<eople to maintain the public faith, and the consequent ability on the part of th< Government to answer that expectation bv large and frequent pa3 ments m>on the public debt. Tins levcnue from customs for the fiscal Tear 1671 wss greatly in excess of the estimate, amounting to #20C.iTft.40s 05. agsinst #1{M.5.W, 371 14, tor the preceding year. The cost of col lecting ibis revenue was #6,5<)0,67 2 61, for 1871. being three and eleven hundredths per cent., while the cost for the year 1870 was #6,237,137 25, or three and twenty hundredths per cent. The appropriation for the collection of the customs, with the additions derived from tines, penalties, and torfeitnres, exceeded the expend itures by the sum of more than eight hundred thousand dollars, and there is n^doubt that tli" 1 eriuancnt appropriation will Wainple for the present year, and for the next tncal year. The reduction of the rates of duty on the 1st of .lanuaiv. 1871. under the act of .July t4, 1*70. diminished the ini{>ortation of many articles o'nring the last six months of the year 1870. but there whs consequently a large addition to the revenues for the first si* monthsof the year 1*71. A comparison of the first six mouths of the calendar vcar 1871 with the first six months of the calendar vtar 1*70, shows an increase of fifty-five per cent, iu the uuantity of tea iiu j i?rtcd, twenty i-er cent, in tue quantity ol cot lee, fifty-three i>er cent, in tne quautity of bro* n sugar, one hundred and twenty i?er eent. in the quautity of pig iron, one hundred ami eighty-six per cent, m the quantity of mela<ko, one liundied and thirty-nine percent, in the quantity of spicis, and a large increase in many other articles. The probability is that the customs revenue for the current vear will exceed that tor the veai 1870-Tl. The receipts from internal revenue wen !M4C.?f.\lC3.tr.. being ?4.<M8,;?M.2!> less than the estimates presented to Congress in Decern!* r last tor the fiscal year entJlug June 30,1871.

In the estimates for the nex' tiscal year I hav< not inctudtd in the receipts the premium on gold mhich may Ik* sold, nor in the expenditures the premium which may lie paid on bonds to b< purchased in currency. In the suggestions I have the honor to mak< in reference to the reduction or taxes. I keep in view two important facts: first, that the ability of the nation to pay at least flttv millions annu ally of the principal of the public debt shall not be "impaired; and, secondly, that in the change of the revenue system no violence shall be dona te the business interests of the country. While I do not undertake to state precisely the causes which have contributed to the public prosperity, there is no substantial reason for questioning the truth of the statement that Uie last few year have been the most pros]>erous In the history o. the country; years without example in our-own affairs, ana w ithout parallel in the affairs of an> other government. It is practicable to dispense with all revenu from internal sources except that derived fran stamps, spirits, tobacco, and malt liquors. Thes es urces should famish for the rear itfi**73 a rev - enue of about one hundred and ten million* o dollars, making a reduction of taxes of sixteen millions of dollars. The revenue from custom under existing laws, and from lsndsand miscel laneous sources, would amount to about two hundred and thirty-three millions more, making a total revenue for that year of three hundreo. and forty-three millions of dollars. The eapenass of tfcs government, not inclndii^. the amount payable on account of the slnkliu fund, are estimated at #273.MB.773.99. If to this sum be added fifty millions of dollar for payments on aceount of tne public debt. In eluding the amount doe on the sinking fand there remains a balsne* ot about twenty mil lions, within which redactions may be matle in the revenue from customs. This amount, adde< to the reductions frspaaud under the ir terns revenue laws, gives a total reduction of thirty six minions. In this view, I respectfully recommend to th* consideration of Congress tne reduction of tb "duties on salt to the extent et htiv per cent.; tb. duty on bituminous coal to fift'v cents per toe the reduction of the daty on raw hides and skim and the removal of all duties from a large class of articles produced in other countries, which enter into the arts and manufactures of thi country, and which are not produced in the United States, and the revenue from which i inconsiderable. Such a list, with the revenue ikiiTcil from csch ?rtiolf, is In pnni* or prtpi ration, unit will be Mbaittrt to Oonfira The rrci<>\ al of duUss trvm a Urn rises of vlin<* aNd in manalactirM. tud UmiMw tion of the dutie* ii|*?n f?l. furnish ?n oppor tunity for * niiKkrate dfi'rr?* in the r?u? of tin ties upon those pradaafo * Lose cost will l?e diminished by these loupes.

The value of the paper cur rency of tlie count; v during the year* IM and WO ??? apparently appreciated by the in ert aM <1 u-.- ot paper ni mey in the feouth. bu' chiefly by the establishment ot the credit of th. United States upon a dm basis. On the first ot Januarv, Kl, the last-named tact wa* fully ac complished, and si Dot that time the apprecnittou of the pai>er currency has been due wholly W> the increased demand for It in the business affair* of the pountry. The difference between the value of t>apcr money at the present moment and Its value on the first ol Itocember, ime, may be attributed to the latter cause, and furnishes the best means which the eouutry has yet had for ascertaining the quantity of paper cur rency which cau be used aud its value kept at par with gold. The result of this test concurs with what serins to me to be the test opinion up >n the subject, that the ajnaan' of (taper m>uc\ ia cir culation Is still so groat that It cannot be main taincd in value at par with coin. There are two mode* of relief: One is to reduce the ruining of currency, as was recommenced by m ? in u\ annual rejsirt submitted to Congress in Decern Iter. Imji; the other made in to await the growth of the country, and the increasing demuols o> business, which in time will produoe the desired result. The chief means of securing the en?l sought, without a reduction in the volume of curreucy. won Id Ik- the use of pai>er mmev upon the Pacific coast. With this oblect in view, steps have alreadv been taken hv tra Departm- nt for the ptfrjiot*' of aaeertamiii* whether it is i tract i ? able to sul?titute paper for coin, aud I have n ?son to anticipate that a chtngo may be tuvle in the laws relating to National Banks tending to that result, which will not affect unfavorably thegeneral character of the system." "The report of the Controller of the Currency shows that one hundred an 1 ferty-ttve banks have been organized under the act approved ?!ul\ 12, ltffl, providing for the is?u-ot hOv-toor jiillionsot doliarsofadditional bank circulation, and that the sum of f?!,33J,Huo has been issued. By virtue of the Mine act. the Treasury ha redeemed *22,230.000 of the three |>ei eent." cer tificates tlu n in circulation, leaving the sum ot *23 4SW,f*?0 now outstanding. 1 take the libertv ot suggesting, that it apimars to me to be wise to leave the distribution ot the circulation Author ized by said act as it now stands. Should the States that have alrea ly reeeived their proportion of circulation be autlioriKed to take what may remain, only a brief period will elapse 1* lore a demand will be ma<le from States w ith limited circulation for an increase. It seems pi udent, therefore, to retain the balance of the tiit\-four millions for distribution id thorn States now having a claim to It, on the basis of equality of apportionment. The details ot of the snttscription to the loan show that the national banks have, upon the whole, acted liberally?more than a hundred millions of dollars having been subscribed for by the in on their own account. It is not unreasonable to tender to these institutions the opj>ort tnity to subscribe for bonds under the act <i' -Inly 14, IKili, to an amount equal to the deposits required of them as security for circulation, and to couple that offer with" a provision that, after ninety days, to the cktcnt that the offer may I* declined,'other banking associations ui^y be formed in the sev eral states where the existing banks shall have failed to make the required subscription, and the circulation tranferred from such hanks to the t.ew associations. The banks now organized cannot Justly com plain, if, having an opportunity to pursue the husir.esss upon t> e new bonds, and declining it, other association shall succeed to their fran chise* arid rights. The business of the Bureau of Kngraving and Printing has been carried ou with diligence during the year, and with satisfactory results. Although' some efforts have been ma le at counterfeiting the special papers used by the Department. they have not been successful, and the specimens captured are so crude as not to excite serious apprehensions as to ultimate success. Since the first of July, 1?68, seventy million sheet*of pa|>ei lave been manufactured, all of which have been accounted for ou the books of the Department. I respectfully recommend that an appropria tion l>e made for a new issue of national bank notes. Those now iu aae are much worn and very successful counterfeit!-: ot several denomi nations have appeared. The Secretary advises the erection of a gov ernment building at Chicago, in place of that destroyed by tire, of a character suited to the wants of a lirst-cUss city. Also, recommend appropriation* tor ptvilion hospitals at various point*. Also, recommends the pru*agc of a bill lor the organization of a Mint Bureau. lie again calls the attention of Congress to the importance of increasing the salaries of the bu reau officers and heads of division in the Treas ury Department. At present there is great in equality aud injustice existing. He urges the restoiation of the Solicitor ol the Treasury and Solicitor of Internal lievenue from the I>ei?art mcnt of .Justice to the Treasury I>epartment. The Secretary gives the history ot the suc cessful negotiation of the National Loan au thorised by act of -Tuly 14, 1*70, and says that on the 1st of September public notice was given that certain (iv -twenty bonds,to the amount of one hundred millions of dollars, o< the issue of 1??2. sj?ecitied by numlwr as nearly a.- was prac ticable, according to the pro\ isions of the act ot ?lul\ 14. 1s7?\ would be paid on the l?t of l>e ct mber. and that the interest would cease on that date.
