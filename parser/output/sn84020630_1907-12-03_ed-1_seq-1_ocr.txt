It was a matter of public comment during the progress of the statehood meeting in this city on Saturday last that no word had been received from Delegate W. H. Andrews In the na tional capital.

SXXXXX XXX X From Information contained In dis patches last night and this morning from Velarde It was learned that Miss Templeton was either Btabbed to death with a knife or clubbed into in sensibility with a bludgeon and then kicked in the head until death ensued. Instead of being a Baptist missionary teacher as was at first reported it developes that she and a married sis ter conducted a small store In the set tlement where the brutal murder was committed. She Is said to have been a woman about fifty or fifty-five years of age and had lived for over twenty years at Velarde. . How Crime Was Committed. As far as can be learned the murd er of.

Washington, Dec. 3. The annual message of President Roosevelt was received In the senate at 12:43 o'clock and within a minute afterwards its reading was begun. The message was presented to the Senate by "Assistant Secretary to the President Latta, who followed Senators Allison and Teller of the committee which made the customary call upon the President. Senator Allison announced in impress ive tones that the President informed them that he would "comraunicato with the senate in writing immediate ly" and Secretary Latta at once delivered the message. The reading was listened to very closely by the senators who held printed copies of the message. The House of Representatives assem bled today with but one object In view, namely to listen to the Presi dent's message and then adjourned. The galleries showed the Interest of the public as they were crowded al most as much a3 they were on the ODcnins day. JuRt preceding the read ing of the President's message rSpea?v er Cannon read the following telegram rrom Oklahoma: "Oklahoma's first 6tate legislature just organized, inspired- by the fond reality of local self-government, sends its heartiest greeaings to the Sixtieth Congress of the greatest na tion on earth and conveys to its sis ter states a message of progress and prosperity and loyal ' devotion to tho union and the common good."

On reconvening the President's secretary appeared with the President's mess age. It was laid before the House and its reading was begun by the clerk. Meantime printed copies of the message were laid on the tables of each member. Following Is a synopsis of the message: The President's Message. To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives. No nation has greater resources than ours, and- I think it can be truthfully said that the citizens of no nation possess greater energy and in dustrial ability. . In no nation are the fundamental business conditions sounder than in ours at this very mo ment; and it is foolish, when such Is the case, for people to hoard money Instead of keeping it in sound banks; for it is such hoarding that is the im mediate occasion of money stringency. Moreover, as a rule, the business or our neonle is conducted with honesty and probity,, and this applies alike to farms and factories, to railroads ana banks, to all our legitimate commer cial enterprises. In any large body of men, however, there are certain to be some who are dishonest, and if the conditions are such that these men prosper or com mit their misdeeds with impunity, their example is a very evil thing for the community. Where these men are business men of great sagacity and of temperament both unscrupu lous and reckless, and where the con ditions are such that they act without, supervision or control and at first without effective check from public opinion, they , delude many innocent neoDle Into making investments or embarking in kinds of business thatj are really unsound. When the mis deeds of these successfully dishonest men are discovered, suffering comes not only upon them, but upon the in nocent men whom they have misled. It is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs; and, naturally, when it does occur those who suffer are apt to for get that the longer It was deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty it is both wise and Droner to endeavor so far as possible to minimize the distress of those, who have been misled by the guilty. Yet it, is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ultimate causes of the suffering, and. as a means to this end. where possible to punish those respon- sible for them. Tnere may bo honest differences of opinion as to many governmental policies; but surely there can be no such differences as to the need of unflinching persever ance In tho war against successful dis ( honesty. I Currency. j "I especially call your attention to the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ablv served a great purpose in aiding the enormous business development of the country, and within ten years there has been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $33.08. For several years evidence has been accu mulating that additional legislation is needed. The recurrence of each cr opseason emphasizes the deefcts of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, because to leave them as they are means to incur lia bility of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has been a (hictuation in the Interest on call money from 2 per cent tot' 30 per cent anu tho fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The Secretary of the Treasury had to step in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse than such fluctuation is tho advance in commercial rates and me uncertainty felt In the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All com mercial interests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for call money in New York attract money from the Interior banks into the spec ulative Held. This depletes the fund that would otherwise bo available for commercial uses, and commercial bor rowers are forced to pay abnormal rates, so that each fall a tax. in the shape of Increased interest charges, is placed on the whole commerce of the country. "The mere statement of thesn facts shows that our present system is seri ously defective. There Is need of a change. Unfortunately. however. many of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because they are complicated, are not easv of comprehension, and tend to disturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any nlan which would materially impair the value ot the United States 2 per cent bonds now pledged to secure circulation, tho issue of which was made under con ditions peculiarly creditable to the treasury. I do not Dress anv esneclal plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expert committees of Banners. Among the plana which are possibly feasible and which certalniv should receive your consideration is that repeatedly brought to your atten tion by the present Secretary of the Treasury, the essential features of wnich have been approved by many prominent bankers and buslnasa According to this plan national banks snouia ne permitted to issue a speci- nea proportion of their canital in notes of a given kind, the Issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in legi timate trade. This Dlan would not permit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet the emergency presented bv Oman of stringency. "I do not say that thla Is thn rlirht system. I only advance It to size my belief that there is need for the adoption of some system which snail be automatic and open to all sound banks, so as to avoid all possi bility of discrimination and favorit ism. Such a plan would now obtain In the New York market: for at nrAH- ent there is too much currency at cer tain seasons or the year, and its ac cumulation purposes: whereas at oth- er times when the crops are being moved there is urgent need for a large but temporary increase in the currency supply. It must never be forgotten that this question concerns business men generally quite as much as bankers; especially Is this true of stockmen, farmers, and business men in the West; for at present at certain seasons of the year the difference' in interest rates between the East and West Is from 6 to 10 per cent, where- asIn Canada tho corresponding dif-fereflsuj-ier cent. Any plan must, of course; guard the interests of western and soutnern bankers as carefully as It gimrds the interests of New York or Chicago bankers, and must be drawn from the standpoints of the farmer and the merchant no less than from the standpoints of the city banker and tae country banker." I again urge on the Congress the need of Immediate attention to this matter. We need a greater elasticity in our currency; provided, of course, that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and securo currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by the National authori ties. Provision should bo made for an emergency currency. The emer gency issue should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully prescribed by the government. Such emergency Issue must be based on adequate securi ties approved by the government, and must be issued "under a heavy tax This would permit currency being is used when the demand for it was ur gent, while securing Its retirement as the demand fell off. It is worth in vestigatlng to determine whether ofll

Topeka, Kans., Dec. 3. Judse Dana In the Supreme court, today decided in the case in which the state Is try ing to prove that tho International Harvester Company is a trust, that the "Texas confession" of the companj is not admlssable as evidence in the present case. In the Texas case, which Is similar to this one, the Harvester Company confessed judgment and paid a fine of $35,000 for violating the laws of that state. The court held that the payment of the fine imposed by the Texas court was in the nature of a compromise and not a confession of guilt. 

BURNS VICTORY WAS UNPOPULAR Easily Put the "Flxlns" to "Gunner" Molr, Champion Heavyweight of England. New York, Dec. 3 Although giving Burns all the credit for defeating "Gunner" Molr in the heavyweight bat tle In London last night, the English press Is not pleased with the victory, according to extras of English papers cabled here this morning.

TORPEDO FLEETJO PACIFIC Action of Mikado's Govern ment Causes Washing, ton to Take Notice Washington, Dec. 3. Viscount Slu Zo Aoki, Japanese ambassador to the United States, has been recalled. He called at the White House and the state department today, notifying President Roosevelt nnd Secretary Root of this fact. Technically he has been sent for by his government to make personal report as to the feel ing in this country on the exclusion question. Ambassador Aoki gave no tice of his recall practically at the same time word was received of the sailing of the torpedo section of the Japanese fleet destined for the Pa cific. Aoki Popular in Washington. Aoki has been an unswerving friend of the United States througuout all tho recent difficulties. He has been here a little over a year aud his re call so soon can be taken as nothing but an expression of a disapproval of his course. It Is believed the purpose of the Japanese government is to secure from Viscount Aoki Information which Commissioner Ishli could not have possibly acquired during his short stay in America regarding the attitude of the administration here with particular refernce to measures recently applied by the Japanese gov ernment to restrict the departure from Japan for America of large num bers of the coolie element. Also that the Japanese government desires a prudent forecast of the likllhood of congressional action in the direction of exclusion legislation. There is no official intimation that Ambassador Aoki is not to return. "

BIG STEAMSHIP STRIKES LEDGE 600 Passengers Barely Escape Watery Grave Vessel a Total Loss. ' Halifax, N. S., Dec. 3. The admir alty office will at once begin an in vestigation to place the blame, if any, for the wreck of the Canadian Pacific steamer Mount Temple which struck the Lahave ledges during a snow storm yesterday. Present Indications are that the Mount Temple will be a total loss. The work of transferring the pas sengers and crew to the mainland took place this morning. The saving of all of the passengers, more than 600 in number, under the most dan gerous conditions, is regarded as a feat unexcelled in the annals of ma rine disasters In the North Atlantic. When the ship struck the rocks hundreds of immigrants among whom were more than 200 women and children were thrown into a panic. Heavy seas swept over the ship and for hours the passengers stood waist deep In water. All suffered terribly from the cold. As soon as order was restored a line was taken ashore and by means of baskets the women and children were transferred to the island. Several fish ing schooners assisted and within three hours all had been landed safely on the island without an accident,
