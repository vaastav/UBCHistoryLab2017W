This la an exceedingly satisfactory showing, es pecially In riow of the fact that during this period the nation has never hesitated to un dertake any expenditure that It regarded as necessary. There have been no new taxes and ne Increases of taxes; on the contrary, some taxea have been taken off; there has been a reduction of taxation. 

CORPORATIONS : As regards the great corporations engaged in Interstate business, and especially the rail roads, I can only repeat what I have already again and again said In my messages to the congress. I believe that under the Interstate clause of the Constitution the United Stales has complete and paramount right to control all agencies of interstate commerce, and I be lieve that the national government alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effective ness so as both to secure Justice from and to do Justice to the great corporations which are the most Important factors in modem busi ness. I believe that It Is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all combinations as Is done by the Sherman anti-trust law, because such a law can be enforced only Imperfectly and unequally, and Its enforcement works al most as much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that Instead of an unwise effort to prohibit all combinations there shall be sub stituted a law which shall expressly permit combinations which are In the Interest of the public bnt shall at the same time give to some agency of th._ national government full power of oontrol and supervision over them. One of the chief features of this control should be securing entire publicity In all mat ters which the public has a right te know, and furthermore the power, not by Judicial, but by executive action, to prevent or put a stop to every form of Improper favoritism or other wrongdoing. The railways of the country should be put completely under the Interstate commerce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. The power of the com mission should be made thoroughgoing, so that 18 could exercise complete supervision and control over the Issue of securities as well as! over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should In summary. The power to Investigate the financial operations and accounts of the rail ways has been one of the most valuable fea tures In recent legislation. Power to make combinations , and traffic agreements should be explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of the commission being first gained and the combination or agreement be ing published in all Its details. In the In terest of tha public the representatives of tho public should have complete power to see that the railroads do their duty by the public, and as a matter of course this power should also be exercised so as to see that no Injustice Is done to the railroads. The shareholders, the employes and the shippers all have In terests that must be guarded. It Is to the Interest of all of them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed and that there should be no Improper Issuance of se curities. The guiding Intelligences necessary for the successful building and sucessful man agement of railroads should receive ample re muneration, but no man should be allowed to make money In connection with railroads out of fraudulent overcapitalization and kindred stock grambllng performances; there must be no defrauding of Investors, oppression of the farmers and business men who ship freight or callous disregard of tne rights and needs of the employes. In addition to this the In terests of the shareholders, of the em ployes and of the shippers should all be guarded as against one another. To give any ono of them undue and improper considera tion v is. to do Injustice to the others. Rates must be made as low as Is compatible with giving proper returns to all the employes of the railroad, from the highest to the low est and proper returns to the shareholders, but they must not, for Instance, be reduced In such fashion as to necessitate a cut ln the wages of the employes or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits of honest share holders. . '- Telegraph and telephone companies en gaged In Interstate business should be put un der the Jurisdiction of the Interstate commerce commission. . PUBLIC SUPERVISION .It Is very earnestly to be wished that our people, through their representatives, should act In this matter. It la bard to say whether most damage to the country at large would come from entire failure on the part of the publio to supervise and control the actions of the great corporations or from the exer cise of the necessary governmental power ln a way which would do injustice and wrong to the corporations. Both the preachers of an . unrestricted . Individualism and the preach . era of an oppression which would deny to able men of business —~ just reward of their Initiative and business sagfaclty, are advocating policies that would be fraught with the gravest harm to the whole country. To permit every lawless capitalist, every law defying corporation, to take any action, no matter how Iniquitous, ln the effort to se cure an Improper proflt and to build up priv ilege would be ruinous to tbe republic and would mark the abandonment of the effort to secure In the Industrial world the spirit of demoeratio fair dealing. On the other hand, to attach thee* wrongs In that spirit of demagogy whleh can see wrong only when committed by the man of wealth and la dumb and blind In the presence of wrong com mitted against men of property or by men of no property 1* exactly as evil as currupt ly to defend the ■ wrongdoing of men of wealth. The war we wage must be waged against l misconduct, against wrongdoing wherever It la found, and we must stand heartily for th* rights of every decent man, whether he be a man of great wealth or a man who earns bis livelihood as a-, wage worker or a tiller of the soil. '• ■; It la to the Interest of all of us that there should be a premium put upon individual . initiative and individual capacity, and an ample reward for th* gnat directing Intel ligences alone oompetent to manage the great _-__w___-_M___ri_«Mi-t______-_H___________atl__li_--_____BM business operations of today. It la well to keep in mind that exactly as the anarchist Is the worst enemy of liberty and tho reaction ary the worst enemy of order, so the men who defend the rights of property have most to fear from the wrongdoers of great wealth, and thn men who are championing popular rights have most to fear from the dema gogues who In the name of popular rights would do wrong to and oppress h'^nest men, honest men of wealth, for the success of cither type of wrongdoer necessarily Invites a violent reaction against the cause the wrong doer nominally upholds. In point ot danger to the nation there is nothing to choose be tween on the one hand the corruption!.!, the bnbe-giver, the bribe-taker, the man who employs his great talent to swindle his fellow citizens on a large scale, and. on the other , hand, the preacher of class hatred, the man ; who, whether from Ignorance or from willing- ■ ness to sacrlflce his country to his ambition, ! persuades well meaning but wrong-headed j men to try to destroy the Instruments upon which our prosperity mainly rests. Let each group of men beware of and guard against the shortcomings to which that group is it self most liable. Too often we see the business community in a spirit of un healthy class consciousness deplore the ef fort to hold to account under the law the wealthy men who In their management of great corporations, whether railroads, street railways or other Industrial enterprises, have behaved in a way that revolts the conscience of the plain, decent people. Such an atti tude cannot be condemned too severely, for men of property should recognize that they Jeopardise the rights of property when they fall heartily to Join in the effort to do ; away with the abuses of wealth. On the j other hand, those who advocate proper con trol on behalf of the public, through the state, of these great corporations and of the j wealth engaged on a giant scale in business j operations, must ever keep in mind that un- { less they do scrupulous Justice to the corpo- J rations, unless they permit ample profit and cordially encourage capable men of business so long as they act with honesty, they are striking at the root of our national well being; for in the long run, under the mere pressure of material distress, the people as a whole would probably go back to the reign of an unrestricted Individualism rather than submit to a control by the state so drastic and so foolish, conceived in a spirit of such unreasonable and narrow hostility to wealth as to prevent business operations from being profitable, and therefore to bring ruin upon the entire business community and ultimately upon the entire body of citizens. STATES RIGHTS The opposition to government control of these great corporations makes its most ef fective effort in the shape of an appeal to the old doctrine of states rights. Of course, there are many sincere men who now believe In unrestricted Individualism in business, Just as there were formerly many sincere men who believed in slavery—that is, in the unre stricted right of an Individual to own an other Individual. These men do not by them selves have great weight, however. The ef fective fight against adequate government con trol and supervision of Individual, and es pecially of corporate, wealth engaged In In terstate business Is chiefly done under cover, and especially under cover of an appeal to states rights. It Is not at all Infrequent to read In the same speech a denunciation of predatory wealth fostered by special privilege and defiant of both the public welfare and law of the land, and a denunciation of cen tralization in the central government of the power to deal with this centralized and or ganized wealth. Of course, the policy set forth in such twin denunciations amounts to ab solutely nothing, for the first half Is nullified by the second half. The chief reason among the many sound and compelling reasons that led to the formation of the national gov ernment was the absolute need that the Union, and not the several states, should deal w(th Interstate and foreign commerce, and the power to deal with Interstate commerce^ was granted absolutely and plenarily to the central government and was exercised com pletely as regards the only Instruments of In terstate commerce known ln those days—the waterways, the high roads, as well as the partnerships of individuals who then con ducted all of what business there was. In terstate commerce Is now chiefly conducted by . railroads, and the great corporation has sup , planted the mass of small partnerships or In ■ dividuals. ' The proposal to make the na tional government supreme over, and there fore to give It complete control over, the railroads and other instruments of Interstate commerce Is merely a proposal to carry out to the letter one of the prime purposes. If not the prime purpose, for which the Constitu tion was founded. It does not represent clvlll zaticn. It represents merely the acknowledg ment of the patent fact that centralization has already come ln business. If this Irre sponsible outside business power Is to be controlled In the Interest of the gen eral publio it can only be controlled In one way; by giving adequate power of control to the one sovereignty ca pable of exercising such power—the national government. Forty or fifty separate state governments cannot exercise that power over corporations doing business In most .or all of them; first, because they absolutely lack the authority to deal with Interstate business in any form: and, second, because of the Inev itable conflict of authority sure to arise in the effort to enforce different kinds of state regu lation, often Inconsistent with one another and sometimes oppressive In themselves. Such dlvlaed authority cannot regulate commerce with wisdom and effect. The central gov ernment is the only power which, with out oppression, can nevertheless thoroughly and adequately control and supervise the large corporations. To abandon the effort for na tional control means to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to render likely continual bursts of action by state legisla tures, which cannot achieve tho purpose sought for, but which can do a great deal of damage to the corporation without conferring and real benefit on the public. INTERSTATE CONTROL I believe that the more far-sighted corpora tions are themselves coming to recognize the unwisdom of the violent hostility they have displayed during the last few years to reg ulation and control by the national govern ment of combinations engaged tn Interstate business. The truth Is that we who believe ln this movement of asserting and exercising a genuine control, In the public Interest, over these great corporations have to contend against two sets of ' enemies, who, though nominally opposed to one another, are really allies in preventing a proper solution of the problem. There are, first, the big corpora tion men, and the extreme Individualists among business men, who genuinely believe in utterly unregulated business— that Ib, In the reign of plutocracy; and, second, the men who, being blind to the economic movements of the day, believe in a movement of re pression rather than of regulation of cor porations, and who denounce both the power of the railroads and the exercise of the fed eral power which alone can really control the railroads. Those who believe ln efficient national control, on the other hand, do not in the least object to combinations; do not In the least object to concentration ln busi ness administration. On the contrary, they favor both, with the all Important proviso that there shall be such publicity about their workings, and such thoroughgoing control over them, as to Insure their being in the Interest and not against the Interest of the general public. We do not object to the concentra tion of wealth and administration; but we do believe in the distribution of the wealth in proflts to the real owners, and in securing to the public the full benefit of the concen- j trated administration. We believe that with concentration in administration there can come both the advantage of a larger ownership j and of a more equitable distribution of proflts, and at the same time a better service to the commonwealth. We believe that the admin istration should bi for the benefit of the many; and i that greed and rascality, prac ticed on a large scale, should be punished as relentlessly as if practiced on 4. small j scale. We do not for a moment believe that the problem will be solved by any short and easy method. The solution will come only by press ing various concurrent remedies. Some of these remedies must He outside the domain of all government. Some must lie outside the domain of the federal government. But there la legislation which the federal govern ment alone can enact and which Is absolutely vital In order to secure the attainment of our purpose. Many laws are needed. There should be regulation. by the national gov ernment of the great Interstate corporations, Including a simple method of account keep ing, publicity, supervision of the Issue of se curities, abolition of rebates and of special privileges. There should be short t. time franchises for all corporations engaged In public business; Including the corporations which get .power from water rights. There should be national as well as state guardian ship of mines and forests. The labor legls- LOS ANGELES HERALD: WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 9, 1908. latlon hereinafter referred to should concur rently be enacted Into law. To accomplish this, means of course a cer tain Increase ln the use of—not the creation of—power, by the central government. The power already exists; It does not have to De created, the only Question Is whether it shall be used or left Idle—and meanwhile the cor porations over which the power ought to bo exercised will not remain Idle. Let those who object to this Increase In the use of the only power available, the national power, be frank, and admit openly that they propose | to abandon any effort to control the great j business corporations and to exercise super ; vision over the accumulation and distribu ! tion of wealth; for such supervision and con- I trol can only come through this particular 1 kind of Increase of power. We no more be ! lieve in that empiricism which demands ab : solutely unrestrained Individualism than we i do in that empiricism which • clamors for a J deadening socialism which would destroy nil Individual initiative and would ruin the coun try with a completeness that not even an unrestrained Individualism Itself could achieve. The danger to American democracy lies not in the least in the concentration of adminis trative power in responsible and accountable hands. It lies in having the power Insuf ficiently concentrated, so that no one can be held responsible to the people for Its use. Concentrated power is palpable, visible, re sponsible, easily reached, Quickly held to ac count. Power scattered through many administra tors, many legislators, many men who work behind .and through legislators and adminis trators. Is Impalpable, is unseen, is irrespon sible, cannot ■be reached, cannot be held to account. Democracy Is in peril wherever the j administration of political power is scattered among a variety of men who work In secret, , whose very names are unknown to the com -1 mon people. It is not in peril from any man i who derives authority from the people, who ! exercises It in sight of the people, and who | la from time to time compelled to give an ■ account of its exercise to the people. LABOR There are many matters affecting labor and the status of the wageworker to which I should like to draw your attention, but na exhaustive discussion of the problem in an Its aspects is not now necessary. This ad ministration la nearlng Its end; and, more over, under our form of government the so lution of the problem depends upon the action of the states as much as upon the action of the nation. Nevertheless, there are certain considerations which I wish to set before you, because I hope that our people will more and more keep them ln mind. A blind and Ig norant resistance to every effort for the re form of abuses and for the readjustment if society to modern Industrial conditions rep resents not true conservatism, but an incite ment to the wildest radicalism, for wise radi calism and wise conservatism go hand in hand, one bent on progress, the other bent on seeing that no change Is made unless in the right direction. I believe ln a steady ef fort, or perhaps lt would be more accurate to say ln steady efforts In many directions, to bring about a condition of affairs under which the men who work with hand or brain, the laborers, the superintendents, the men who product for the market and the men who find a market for the articles produced, shall own a far greater share than at present of the wealth they produce, and be enabled to in vest It In the tools and Instruments by which all work Is carried on. As far as possible I hope to see a frank recognition of the ad vantages conferred by machinery, organiza tion, and division of labor, accompanied oy an effort to bring about a larger share ln the ownership by wageworker of railway, mill and factory. In farming, this simply means that we wish to see the farmer own his"own land; we do not wish to see the farms so large that they become the property of absentee landlords who farm them by tenants, nor yet so small that the farmer becomes like a European peasant Again, the depositors ln our savings banks now number over one-tenth of our entire population. These are all capi talists, who through the savings banks loan their money to the workers—that Is, in many 1 eases to themselvesto carry on their various Industries. The more we Increase their num ber, the more we introduce the principles of co-operation .into our industry. Every increase In the number of small stockholders in cor porations Ib a good thing, for the same rea sons; and where the employes are the stock holders the result Is particularly good. Very much of this movement must be outside of anything that can be accomplished by legls ltalon; but legislation can do a good deal. Postal savings banks will make it easy for the poorest to keep their savings In absolute safety. The regulation of the national high ways must be such that they shall serve all people with equal Justice. Corporate finances must be supervised so as to make It far safer than at present for the man of small means to Invest his money in stocks. There must be prohibition of child labor, diminution of woman labor, shortening of hours of all me chanical labor; stock waterlae should be prohibited, and stock gambling so far as pos sible discouraged. There should be a pro gressive Inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial education should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium upon thrift, hard work,. and business energy; but these qualities cease to be the main factors in accumulating a fortune long before that fortune reaches a point where it would be seriously affected by any Inherit ance tax such as I propose. It is eminently right that the nation should fix the term-* upon which the great fortunes are Inherited. They rarely do good and they often de harm to those who Inherit them in their entirety. 

PROTECTION OF LABOR The above Is the merest sketch, hardly even a sketch In outline, of the reforms for which we should, work. But there la one matter with which congress should deal at this ses sion. There should no longer be any paltering with the question of taking care of the wags workers who. under our present Industrial system, become killed, crippled, or worn out as part of the regular Incidents of a given business. The majority of wageworkers must have their rights secured for them by state action; but the national government should legislate ln thoroughgoing and far-reaching fashion not only for all employes of the national government, but for all persons en gaged in interstate commerce. The object sought for could be achieved to a measurable degree, as far as those killed or crippled are concerned, by proper employers' liability laws. As far as concerns those who have been worn out, I call your attention to the fact that definite steps toward providing old-age pen sions have been taken in many of our private Industries. These may be Indefinitely extend ed through voluntary association and con tributory schemes, or through the agency of savings banks, jas under the recent Massa chusetts plan. To strengthen these practical measures should be our immediate duty, It la not at presont necessary to consider the larger and more general governmental schemes that most European governments have found them selves obliged to adopt. Our present system, or rather no system, works dreadful wrong, and is of benefit to only one class of people—the lawyer. When a workman Is injured what he neds Ib not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but th* certainty of relief through Immediate admin istrative action. The number of accidents which result ln the death or crippling of wageworkers. In the Union at large, is sim ply appalling: In a very few years it runs up a total far in excess of the aggregate of the dead and wounded in any modern war. No academic theory about "freedom of con tract" or "constitutional liberty to contract" should be permitted to interfere with this and similar movements. Progress In civiliza tion has everywhere meant a 'limitation and regulation of contract. I call your especial attention to the bulletin of the bureau of la bor which gives a statement of the methods of treating the unemployed In European coun tries, as this Is a subject which la Germany, for instance, is treated In connection with making provisions for wornout and crippled workmen. a thoroughgoing investigation and Pending a thoroughgoing Investigation and action there is certain legislation which should be enacted at once. The law. passed at the i tost session of the congress, granting com pensation to certain classes of employes of the government, should be made more liberal in Its terms. There Is no good ground for the distinction made in the law between those en gaged in hazardous occupations and those not so engaged. If a roan Is injured or Mill any line of work. It was hazardous In his case. Whether 1 per cent or 10 per cent of those following a given occupation actually suffer injury or death ought not to have «ny bearing on the question of their receiving com pensation. It Is a grim logic which says to an Injured employe or to the dependents or one killed that he or they are entitled to no compensation because very few people other than he have been Injured or killed in that occupation. Perhaps one of the most striking omissions, in the law Is that it does not em brace peace officers and others whose lives may be .sacrificed in enforcing the laws of the United tSates. The terms of the act providing compensation Is not adequate for a wage-earner- family in the : event of nia death 'by accident ln the course of hi* em ployment. And ln the event of death occur ring, say, ten or eleven months after the ac cident, the family Would only receive as com pensation the equivalent of one or two months' earnings. In this respect the generosity of the United States towards Is employes com pares most unfavorably with that of every country In Europe—even the poorest. 

FATAL NEGLIGENCE The terms of the act are also a hardship ln prohibiting payment In cases where the accident is In any way due to the negligence of tho employe. It Is Inevitable that dally familiarity with danger will lead men to take chances that can be construed into negligence. So well is this recognized that In practically all countries In the civilized world, except the United States, only a great degree of negligence acts as a bar to securing compen sation. Probably in no other respect' la our legislation, both state and national, so far behind practically the entire civilized world as ln.the matter of liability and compensa tion for accidents in Industry. It Is humiliat ing that at European International congresses on accidents the United States should be singled out as the most belated among the nations in respect to employers' liability legis lation. This government Is Itself a large em ployer of labor, and In Its dealings with its employes It should set a standard ln this country which would place It on a par with the most progressive countries In Europe. The laws of the United States ln this respect and the laws of Europcnn countries have been summarized ln a recent bulletin of the bureau of labor, and no American who reads this sum mary can fall to be struck by the great con trast between our practices and theirs— con trast not In any sense to our credit. The congress should without further delay pass a model employers' liability law for the District of Columbia. The employers' liability act recently declared unconstitutional, on ac count of apparently Including In Its provisions employes engaged In Intrastate commerce as well as those engaged ln Interstate commerce, has been held by the local courts to be still In effect so far as Its provisions apply to tlio District of Columbia. There should be no ambiguity on this point. If .there la any doubt on the subject, the law should be re enacted with special reference to the District of Columbia. This act. however, applies only to employes of common carriers. In all other occupations the liability law of the district Is the old common law. Tho severity and In justice of the common law in this matter has been ln some degree or another modified In the majority of our states, and the only Juris diction under the exclusive control of the con gress should he ahead and not behind the states of the Union In this respect. A com prehensive employers' liability law should be passed for the District of Columbia. I renew my recommendation made tn a previous message that half-holidays be granted, during summer to all wage workers In govern ment employ. I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour day should as rapidly and as far as practicable be extended to the entire work being carried on by the government. Tho present law should be amend ed to embrace contracts on those public works which the present wording of the act seems to exclude. .. THE 

COURTS I most earnestly urge upon the congress the duty .of Increasing the totally Inadequate salaries now given to our Judges. On the whole there la no body of public servants who do as valuable work, nor whose moneyed re ward is so Inadequate compared to their work. Beginning with the supreme court thee Judges should have their salaries doubled, It Is not befitting the dignity of the nation that Its most honored public servants should be paid sums so small compared to what they would earn in private life that the performance a. public servico by them Implies an exceed ingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice. It is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for doing away with the long delays which now obtain ln the ad ministration of Justice, and which operate with peculiar severity against persons of small means, .and favor only the very criminals whom It Is most desirable to punish. These long delays In the final decisions of cases make in the aggregate a crying evil; and a remedy should be devised. Much of thlß Intolerable delay Is due to Improper regard to technicalities which are a mere hindrance to Justice. In some noted recent cases this over-regard for technicalities has resulted In a striking denial of Justice, and flagrant wrong to the body politic. .  . . At the last election certain leaders of or ganized labor made a violent and sweeping attack upon the entire Judiciary of the coun try, an attack couched in such terms as to Include the most upright, honest and broad minded Judges, no less than those of narrower mind and more restricted outlook. It was the kind of attack admirably fitted to prevent any successful attempt to reform abuses of the Judiciary, because It gave the champions of the unjust Judge their eagerly desired oppor tunlty to shift their ground Into a champion ship of Just Judges who were unjustly assailed. Last year, before the house committee on the. Judiciary, theso same labor leaders formu lated their demands, specifying the bill that contained them, refusing all compromise, stat ing they wished the principle of that bill nr nothing. They Insisted on a provision that in a labor dispute no Injunction should Issue ex cept to protect a property right, and specifi cally provided that the right to carry on busi ness should not be construed ns a property right; and In a second provision their bill made legal in a labor dispute any act or agree ment by or between two or more persons that would not havo been unlawful If done by a single person. In other words, this bill legal ized blacklisting and boycotting In every form, legalizing, for instance, those forms of the secondary boycott which tho anthracite coal strike commission so unreservedly condemned; while the right to carry on a business was expllclty taken out from under that protec tion which the law throws over property. The demand was made that there should be trial by Jury In contempt cases, thereby most seri ously Impairing the authority of the courts. All this represented a coutae of policy which. If carried out. would mean the enthronement of class privilege In Its crudest and most brutal form, and the destruction of one of the most essential functions of the Judiciary In all Civilized lands. ;, v CLASS HATRED The violence of the crusade for this legisla tion, and Its complete failure. Illustrate two truths which It is essential our people should learn. In the first place, they ought to teacn the worklngman, the laborer, the wageworker, that by demanding what Is improper and Im possible he plays into tho hands of his foes. Such a crude and vicious attack upon tlio courts, even If it were temporarily successful, would Inevitably in the end cause a violent reaction and would hand the great mass of citizens together, forcing them to stand by all the Judges, competent and incompetent alike, rather than to see the wheels of Justice stopped. A movement of this kind can ulti mately result ln nothing but damage to those In whose behalf It la nominally undertaken. This Is a most healthy truth, which lt Is wise for all our people to learn. Any movement baaed on that class hatred which at times assumes the name of "class consciousness" la certain ultimately to fall, nnd If it tem porarily succeeds, to do far-reaching damage. "Class consciousness," where It la merely an other name for the odious vice of class selfish ness, Is equally noxious whether In an em ployer's association or in a worklngman's asso ciation. The movement In question was one In which the appeal was made to all working men to vote primarily, not as American citi zens, but as Individuals of a certain class In' aoclety. Such an appeal ln the first place re volts the more high-minded, and far-sighted among persons to whom lt Is addressed, and ln the second place tends to arouse a strong antagonism among all other classes of citizens, whom it therefore tends to unite against the very organization on whose behalf it Is issued. The result Is therefore unfortunate from every I standpoint. This healthy truth, by the way, will be learned by the Socialists If they ever succeed in establishing In this country an Im portant national party based on such class consciousness and selfish class Interest. The rapid changes in ojfr social and indus trial life which have attended this rapid growth have made lt neceseary that, ln apply ing to concrete eases the great rule of right laid down In our constitution, there should be a full understanding and appreciation of the new conditions to which the rules are to be ap plied. What would have been an Infringe ment upon liberty half a century ago may be the necessary safeguard of liberty today. JUDICIAL CHANGES What would have been an Injury to property then may be necessary to the - enjoyment of property now. Every Judicial decision involves two terms—one, an Interpretation of the law; the other, the understanding of the facts to which It Is to be applied. The great mass of our Judicial officers are I believe alive to theso changes of conditions which so materially affect the performance of their Judicial duties. Our judicial system Is sound and effective at i core, and It remains, and must ever be main tained, as the safeguard of those principles of liberie and Justice which stnnd at the founda tion of American Institutions; fur. as Burke finely said, when liberty and Justice are separated, neither Is safe. There are. how ever, some ib<ers of the Judicial body who have lagged behind tn their understanding of these great and vital changes In the body politic, whose minds have never been opened to tho new applications .of tho old principles made necessary by the new conditions. Judges of this stamp do lasting harm by their de cisions, because they convince poor men ln need of protection that the courts of the land are profoundly ignorant of and out of sym pathy with their needs, and profoundly In different or hostile to any proposed remedy. To such men It seems a cruel mockery to have any court decide against them on the ground that lt desires lei preserve "liberty" In .1 purely technical form, by withholding liberty In any real and constructive sense. It Is de sirable that the legislative body should possess, and wherever necessary exercise, the power to determine whether in a given ease employers and employes are not on an equal footing, so that the- necessities of the latter compel them to submit to such exactions as to hours ond conditions of labor asf unduly to tax their strength; and only mischief can result when such determination is upset on the ground thnt there must be no "Interference with the liberty to contract"— a merely academic "liberty," the exercise of which is the nega tion of real liberty. There are certain decisions by various courts which have been exceedingly detrimental to the rights of wageworkers. This is true of all the decisions that decide that men and women are. by the constitution, "guaranteed their liberty" to contract to enter a dangerous oc cupation, or to work an undesirable or im proper number of hours, or to work In un healthy surroundings; and therefore cannot recover damages when maimed in that occu pation, and cannot be forbidden to work what the legislature decides is an excessive number of hours, or to carry on the work under con ditions which the. legislature decides to be unhealthy. The most dangerous occupations are often the poorest paid and those whore the hours of work aro longest; and in many cases those who go Into them are driven hy neces sity so great that they have practically no alternative. Decisions such as those alluded to above nullify the legislative effort to pro tect the wageworkers who moat need protec tion from those employers who take advantage of their grinding Mad, They halt or hamper the movement for securing better and more equitable conditions of labor. The talk about preserving to the misery-hunted beings wno make contracts for such service their "liberty" to make them, Is either to steak In a spirit of heartless irony or else to show an utter lack of knowledge of the conditions of life among the great masses of our fellow coun trymen, a lack which unfits a Judge to do good service Just as lt would unfit any executive or legislative officer. There Is also. 1 think, ground for the belief that substantial injustice Is often suffered by employes In consequence of the custom of courts Issuing temporary Injunctions without notice to them, and punishing them for con tempt of court in instances where, as a mat ter of fact, they have no knowledge of any proceedings. Outside of organized labor there Is a widespread feeling that this system often works great Injustice to wageworkers when their efforts to better their working condition result In Industrial disputes. A temporary In junction procured ex parte may as a matter of fact have all the effect of a permanent Injunction In causing disaster to the wage workers' side in such a dispute. Organized labor is chafing under the unjust restraint which comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Its discontent, has been un wisely expressed, and often improperly ex pressed, but there la a sound basis for It, and the orderly and law-abiding people of a community would be In a far stronger position for upholding the courts If the undoubtedly existing abuses could be provided against CLASS LEGISLATION Such proposals as those mentioned above as advocated by the .extreme labor leaders, contain the vital error of being class legis lation of the most offensive kind, and even if enacted Into law I believe that the law would rightly be held unconstitutional. More over, the labor people are themselves now be ginning to Invoke the use of the power of injunction. During the last ten years, and within my own knowledge, at least fifty In junctions have been obtained by labor unions In New Tork city alone, most of them be 11... to protect the union label (a "property right") but some being obtained for other reasons against employers. The power of Injunction is a great equitable remedy, which should on no account be destroyed. But safeguards should be erected against Its abuse. I believe that some such provisions as those I advocated a year ago for checking the abuse of the Issu ance of temporary Injunctions should be adopt ed. In substance, provision should be made that no Injunction or temporary restraining order Issue otherwise than on notice, except where Irreparable injury would otherwise re sult; and in such a case a hearing on the merits of the order should be had within a short fixed period, and, if not then continued after hearing, it should forthwith lapse. De cisions should be rendered Immediately, and the chance of delay minimized In every way. Moreover, I believe that the procedure.should be sharply defined, and the Judge required minutely to state the particulars both of his action and of his reasons therefor, so that the congress can If it desires examine and In vestigate the same. The chief lawmakers/ ln our country may be, and often are, the Judges, because thoy are the final seat of authority. Every time they interpret contract, property, vested rights, due process of law, liberty, they necessarily enact into law parts of a system of social philosophy; and as such Interpretation la fun damental, they give direction to all law making. The decisions of the courts on eco nomic and social questions depend upon their economic and social philosophy; and for the peaceful progress of our people during the twentieth century we shall owe most to those Judges who hold to a twentieth century eco nomic and social philosophy and not to a long outgrown philosophy, which was Itself the product of primitive economic conditions. Of course a Judge's views on progressive social philosophy are entirely second in importance to his possession of a high and fine character; which means the possession of such elementary virtues as honesty, courage and fairminde.l -ness. The Judge who owes his election to pandering to demagogue sentiments or clasH hatreds and prejudices, and the Judge who owes either his election or his appointment to the money or the favor of a great corpora tion, are alike unworthy to Bit on the bench, are alke traitors to the people; and no pro fundity of legal learning, or correctness of abstract conviction on questions of public policy, can serve as an offset to such short, comings. But It Is also true that Judges, Mho executives and legislators, should hold sound views on the questions of public policy which are of vital Interest to the people. The legislators and executives are chosen 'o represent the people in enacting and admin istering the laws. The judges are not chossn to represent the people in this sense. FUNCTION OF JUDGES Their function IB to interpret the laws. The legislators are responsible for the laws; the Judges for the spirit In which they Interpret and enforce the laws. We stand aloof from the reekles.* agitators, who would make the judges mere pliant tools of popular prejudice and passion; and we stand aloof from those equally unwise partisans of reaction and priv ilege who deny the proposition that, Inasmuch as Judges are chosen to serve the Interests of the whole people, they should strive to find out what those Interests are. and. so far ' as they conscientiously can, should strive to give effect to popular conviction when delib erately and duly expressed by the lawmaking body. ■ The courts are to be highly commended and staunchly upheld when they set their faces against wrongdoing or tyranny by, a majority; hut they are to be blamed when ' they fall to recognize under a government | like ours the deliberate judgment of the ma jority as to a matter of legitimate policy, when duly expressed by the legislature. Such law- I fully expressed and deliberate Judgment should be given effect by the courts, save In the extreme and exceptional cases where there has been a clear violation of a constitutional provision. Anything like frivolity or wanton ness In upsetting such clearly taken govern mental action Is a grave offense against the republic. Ta protest against tyranny, to pro tect minorities from oppression, to nullify an act committed In a spasm of popular fury. Is to render a service to the republic. But for the courts to arrogate to themselves func tions which properly belong to the legislative bodies Is all wrong, and In the end works mischief. The people should not be permitted t.i pardon evil and slipshod legislation on the theory that the court will set lt right; they should be taught that the right way to get rid of a bad law Is to have the legislature repeal It, and not to have the courts by In genious hairsplitting nullify It. A law may be unwise and Improper; but tt should not for these reasons be declared unconstitutional by a strained Interpretation, for the result of such action Is to take away from the people at large their sense of responsibility and ulti mately to destroy their capacity for orderly self-restraint and self-government.
