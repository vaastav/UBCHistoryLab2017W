PRESIDENT FAVORS SINGLE-HEAD RULE Governor to Administer Over District, He Proposes. MESSAGE TO CONGRESS Approves Recommendations of Special Commissioner Reynolds. ? ?? LABOR AND HOUSING BUREAU Mr. Boosevelt Elaborates on Ideas of Adviser Hegarding This Branch of Government. Supporting recommendations for change in the form of administration for the District of Columbia, made in the report of James Bronson Reynolds of New York, selected as special commissioner or adviser to the President for the purpose of devising a new form of government, Mr. Roosevelt today sent a message to Congress. Mr. Reynolds' recommendations, as summarized by himself, are as follows: 1. The extension of the civil service to cover all minor offices in the District of Columbia. 2. The creation of the office of governor at a salary of perhaps $10,000 per annum. J. The creation of departments of health, police, fire, building and public works, street engineering, charities, corrections and housing and labor. These departments should be conducted by a commissioner at a salary or" perhaps $3,000 per annum. 4. A municipal council composed of the above named commissioners should constitute a public assembly for the passage of ordinances regulating the affairs of the District. 3. A citizens' committee of 100 to represent all general civic interests. The President's Message. The President's message reads: ' To the Senate and House of Representati\ es: The rapid Increase of population in the National capital within recent years has gw^MOim social conditions, necessitating changes in the machinery of its administration. Greater efficiency and a better provision for the protection of both the industrial and dependent classes arc required. "Recognizing these needs, I have had a special report made to me on the affairs of the District of Columbia which I transmit ^lerewith. I cordially approve the recommendations in the report for: "The substitution of a single head or governor in place of three Commissioners. "The establishment of District or municipal departments in place of the existing bureaus: and "The creation of a new department to be known as that of housing and labor. "I ask your careful consideration of the entire report; Mr. Reynolds has rendered a great and disinterested service for which our heartiest thanks are due him. "A single executive head would increase efficiency, determine responsibility and eliminate delays and uncertainties in% citable under the present system. ".Municipal* departments headed by commissioners to be appointed by the governor would yield the same advantage.

VUUV.UIIVII C1IUUIU be o-ordinated with otla-r city departments. Emphasis on Recommendations. "I especially urge that the proposed department of housing and labor be established. Poverty, disease and crime are largely duo to defects of social conditions and surroundings. The need of improved -unitary inspection of dwellings, rear alleys and small shacks (such as unhappily still exist in Washington) and of stores, workshops and factories should not be left to subordinate bureau chiefs, but should be brought under the direct control of a competent head of the above named department. "An equally important public responsibility is the protection of the independent industrial class. which neither desires nor accepts charity, but whose members have often been led to misfortune and ven crime through agencies licensed by the state, but defectively and inadequately supervised. Notable among these are pawnshops, loan and industrial insurance companies and employment agencies. "The supervision of these agencies is at p:. sent limited to the police. They should 1>?- under the direction of officials qualified to advance their efficient y and economic s? rv ice to t he public. "The above named changes would vastly improve the efficiency of The District government. and would afford protection to industrial and dependent < hisses which is imperatively needed.

V?.^*/W *??* V 44awares and He Flees. ? After more than a week of threat and | talk the House of Representatives today took action on a resolution, professedly of | censure to the President, brought in by the Perkins special committee appointed for the purpose. The resolution, as will be seen by a rare- j ful perusal, is as mild as buttermilk, and. j in the opinion of people around the Capitol \ who ought to know, fully as innocuous. The only effect of the resolution is to j call upon President Roosevelt for any in- I formation he may have in support of his i statement in his annual message of 

PJUS j with respect to any unworthy motive j which actuated members of Congress In ; voting last year to adopt the legislative i limitation contained in the sundry civil bill upon the activities of the secret serv- j ice. J Here is the resolution as adopted by ! the House practically unanimously. Only ; one member. Representative Paul Howland of Ohio, voted in the negative. Later Mr. Howland said he was in entire sympathy with -the President and believed he should have all the secret service money he wanted. The Besolution. Following is the full text of the resolution, together with the accompanying preamble: "Whereas there was contained in the sundry civil appropriation bill, which passed Congress at its last session and became a law, a provision in reference to the employment of the secret service in the Treasury Depart- ? ment. and "Whereas in the last annual message w of the President of the United States to to the tw^ houses of Congress it was se stated in reference to that provision: 'It is not too much to say that this rc' nm^nflmont hou honti r\f Knnofit ?nlv ***? "'Vi ? Wl 1'V.IIVill ? and could be of benefit only, to the ni criminal classes,' and It was further tli stated, 'the chief argument in favor of the provision was that the congressmen did not themselves wish to 5 be investigated by secret service men,' = and it was further stated, 'but if this is not considered desirable a special p exception could be made, in the law, prohibiting the use of Uig^jyjgret serv- . ice force in investigating members of Congress. It would be far better to do this than to do what actually was , done, and strive to prevent or at least to hamper effective action against criminals by the executive branch of the government"; and * of "Whereas the plain meaning of the ^ aboye words is that the majority of * the congressmen were in fear of being J,( investigated by secret service men and that Congress as a whole was actuated by that motive in enacting the )e! provision in question; and "Whereas your committee appointed Ja to consider these statements of the ju President and report to the House cannot find in the hearings before com- t)| mlttecs nor in the records of the j. House or Senate any justification of tills impeachment of the honor and rc integrity of the Congress; and p, "Whereas your committee would pre- jjj for, in order to make an intelligent j, and comprehensive report, just to the President as well as to the Congress, to have all the information which the ai President may have to communicate: jn Therefore, be it er "Resolved, That the President be re- , >j quested to transmit to the House any ' le evidence upon which he based his j statement that the 'brief argument >. in favor of the provision was that the K congressmen did .not themselves wish to be investigated by secret service men." and also to transmit to the House any evidence connecting any gi member of the House of Represent- 1 atives of the Sixtieth Congress with j corrupt action in his official capacity and to inform the House whether lie has instituted proceedings for the punishment of any such individual l>y the T courts or has reported any such alleged delinquencies to the House of Representatives." Senate Example Not Followed. It had been expected that, following the lead of the Senate yesterday, the h] House would bring in a resolution with j, some ginger to it. either of language or rj of suggested action. Hut the resolution adopted todayy does not even lay on the table that portion of the President's rues- 01 sage relating to the secret service, andjjr which was so distasteful to members. js There does not seem to be anything in u| the message which can even simply be * ~ ? ? 1 l->o *> > tn .. f V??? m t w It _ ?"i ?nr*i i ijv(j ?i.*> in t in- miLuir vi nn m<i' u ? talked-of. luii non-materialized rebuke. tl After ISoprfsenliitlve Perking of N'fiv | York, chairman of the special rebuking eomniittee had offered the resolution and w preamble published above, the only dis- '' mission of interest that ensued was with 1,1 uspuet to that particular "whereas" reating to the meaning of the President. l> Representative .Bennett of New York w thought the language of the preatnl.de should make it plain that this was the 11 conclusion arrived at by the committee n and not the House. He demanded a sep- Vl urate vo <* on that paragraph. When Speaker Cannon called for those s' in favor of the adoption of this portion of the preamble practically everbocty rose. Mr. Bennett jumped up and tried to withdraw his demand for a division, but Rep- i " ; resentative Macon of Arkansas. John i J Sharp Williams of Mississippi and other, ' democrats protested. The standing vole | n was continued. w ! o Longworth Runs Away. Representative Longworth of Oldo, tliei1' President's son-in-law, wiio had been sit- Jj ting in ids regular seat, not expecting ^ any call fur a division, was visibly cin- f\ barrassed at this point.

Tt is probable a meeting will be held toorrow or Saturday |pr a discussion of ie matter. The impression prevails today that a eliminary subcommittee, probably of re senators, will be appointed and will t during the Christmas holidays. A recommendation for action on the resident's message will doubtless be ade shortly after Congress reconvenes muary 4. It is not so certain when instigation of the secret service will be included. Senator Hale of Maine, acting chairman the appropriations committee w.ll lubtless he chairman of the subcommite if one is appointed. Senators Warren Wyoming and Gallinger of New Humpilre have been suggested as other relblican members, and Senators Teller of dorado and Tillman ol" South Carolina, i the democrats. Senator Galliiiger. however, expects to ave about the first of the year for Now j ampshlre to be present when the legisture elects his successor. Mr. Galllnger is no fear that he will not be chosen succeed himself, but he wants to be on e ground. This circumstance might >ep him from serving. The other members of the appropriations immitteo are Senators Cullom of Illinois, erkins of California. Klkhis of West Vlrlila Hemenwav of Indiana, republicans; aniel of Virginia, Clay of Georgia and osier of Louisiana, democrats.

EBUKED BY THE PRESIBENT ? ? EMINARY GIRLS RODE AHEAD I OF HIM IN PARK. P hauksgiving Day Incident as Told by Instructress at Forest Glen. llow President Roosevelt severely rejked a party of girls from the National ark Seminary at Forest Glen, Aid., for ding past liim Thanksgiving day in Roek reek Park, and how lie caused the iiorse le of the girls was riding to rear and imp by striking it with his riding whip told in a story which lias just leaked it and been eonlirmed today by Atiss E. Sisson, teacher in the school, who was ie chaperon for the party. Miss Sisson and three of the girls of the istit utioii. whose names are withheld, ent for a horseback ride through Roek reek Park in the crisp air of Thanksgivig morning. As they were Jogging along ie of tiie tree-lined roads of the national serve they saw a party ahead of them hich included two ladies and two men. s they closed up the gap between the vo parlies APss Sisson says she rocogized one of the men as President Rooseilt " For some time the seminary parly rode owly behind the chief executive and his arty. Rut the spirited animals wanted ? go faster, declares Miss Sisson. and nall> the girls galloped past the preslcnlial party. When they slowed their horses down Sain a few minutes later they heard ipid Uonfbeats behind them. The rider ;as pressing his horse hard and lie soon vertook them. "As we were riding f?>nr abreast at the fine, the President's horse crowded 11s <> iiitie as lie dashed past," said Miss isson. continuing Hie narrative. "As e brushed past his horse struck the jo* of,one of the young ladies, knocking from the stirrup, and a. blow from the 'resident's crop fell on the horse's llank. 'he young woman's horse .reared, and ut for her coolness and admirable horselanship she might have been thrown eneath the feet of the'horses. I do not now whether the blow was intentional. " 'Vou know that you should not go head of our party," said the President s he rode past us and turned in the addle to look us squarely in the face. I" then joined his companions. "Naturally, we felt very much mortified, lone of us intended an affront to the 'resident, and 1 cannot understand his etion. "The President appeared to be in a age, but, of course, I do not know about hat. I only know how we felt about it. "I prefer not to give the names of the oung ladies In the party. They are auchters of wealthy parents, highly ooneeied, and I am sure their parents would bjcot to the notoriety attending such an ITair." The story was told about the seminary *ter and has been heard by many solety people in Washington. 

SLEUTHING THE SLEUTH. QUESTIONS PRESIDENT'S ACT QCKTATni} UlVWrU'C PTCATTT. WMMMAVJ.V XWXA JkAliJ XV kJ TION ON MARINE ORDER. Asks by What Authority Men Were Detached From Battleships?Referred to Naval Committee. 1 ' Tt Senator Rayner of Maryland lias his way the Senate will find out by what authority the President issued an order a short while ago detaching the Marine Corps from service on the battleships and the order yesterday declaring that the officers of the corps submit to tests similar to those prescribed by him for army officers. If the Senate shall decide that Congress has the power to promulgate rules governing the Marine Corps that shall lie binding upon the President lie wants such a set of rules adopted. His intention to push the matter was evidfnt today by his introduction of a resolution 011 the subject calling upon the military affairs committee to investigate it. At first lie asked that the resolution be referred to the committee on military affairs, but on the suggestion of Senator llale. chairman of the naval I committee, and with the consent of Sent ator Warren, chairman of the military I committee, the resolution was referred to [ the naval committee. Mr. Rayner"s resolution is as follows: "Whereas the President of the United i States has lately promulgated a series of | orders in connection with the Marine ' Corps, detaching them from the battleI ships, and requiring them to perform eer1 lain tests, as fully set forth in such I order: "Now be ii resolved. That the committee i on military affairs is hereby instructed to ! inquire and report," first, whether the 1 President under existing statutes has the authority to issue these orders; second, ; whether If he has such an authority the : execution of these orders would not impair the efficiency of the marine service, instead of advancing it. and whether the service would not thereby be diverted from the purpose for which it was intended bv law: third, whether Congress lias not the rieht to prescribe a set of rules and I regulations for the, government of the Marine Corps which will bind the President as commander-in-chief of the army an<l navy of the l.'nited States, and if so. to report a set of rules for the government of the Marine Corps to effect the purpose for which said corps was organized and to promote its usefulness." It was very evident that the resolution interested Senator lla'.c greatly, lie took special pains to call Mr. Warren's attention to it and suggest that it go to the naval committee. Mr. Rayncr said Ik- did not have any objection to referring it to the naval committee, but be failed to change the resolution so as to instruct toe naval committee to conduct the inquiry. "The President has taken the marines off the battleships," declared Mr. Rayner, "and turned them into policemen, Janitors, or what not. and I inferred that he intended to disconnect them with thes navy. That is the reason that 1 suggested that the military affairs committee take up the matter." MRS.
