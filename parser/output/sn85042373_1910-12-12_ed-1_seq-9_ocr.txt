MONDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1910. Decision of U. S. Circuit Court Is Important Event in the Week's Stock Market New York, Dec. 12—Quite the most Important event of the past week in the stock market was the decision of the United States circuit court In the 'Pennsylvania district declaring the Temple Iron company an illegal cor poration but otherwise sustaining the main contentions of the several coal ..carrying railroad companies which .control It. The decision freed the -transportation companies from the charges of general conspiracy and violation of the interstate commerce laws and was hailed with satisfaction. Its influence was felt In the recovery of the market from Its irregular and narrow tones of the days immediately preceding. The week otherwise was dull and uninteresting. Such buying power or disposition as was manifested at odd moments came almost entirely from the short Interest, with a sprinkling of odd lot buying, much of which re ported to be for foreign account. President Taft's message was well received and gave heart to the lead ing financial interests, but was oth erwise an Inconsiderable market fac tor. Unusual Interest was manifest ed in the annual report of the secre tary of the treasury, more particular ly the recommendations urging re form in our banking and currency systems. Fgures embraced in the yearly statement of the secretary of agriculture called) |or renewed at tention to the record breaking corn crop, while the sum total of all farm products is BO vast as to almost stag ger the imagination. Money stiffened here during the week and the cash outflow to western and southern points continued. For eign exchange fell to the lowest point in four months, and negotiations for Imports of gold from London were under way. Complete officials from Washington show slight reduction of the loan account by national banks ln the west, mfddle west .and south, but the cash resources of the com bined national banks are well above legal requirements. In the commodity markets the Important event was the advance of cotton options, which made new high records following the. pub lication of the government's estimate of the seasons output In that staple.
