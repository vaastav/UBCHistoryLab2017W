M&) He who shops early and runs away may live to shop some other day. It is reported that Germany is es tablishing a submarine base on an island off the coast of Venezuela. It the report is true, another one of the few fragile threads binding Ger many and the United States in friendly relations probably will be severed. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a large amount to pay for capturing a bug. But if the bill of fered to locate and confine the germ of infantile paralysis, sponsored by Representative Gallivan, accomplishes ts purpose, the whole country will ;ay it was well worth the price. Increased pay for government em ployes, the Saturday half-holiday -all the year around, votes for women, peace in Europe, reduction of the cost of living, and a settlement of he Mexican problem are only a few )f the many things that Santa Claus may stuff in the stockings on the nantel if he intends to be a "regular fellow" this year. Now that the use of steel helmets in the European trenches has become common practice, the neutral nations again are awakened to the fact that fighting is returning to the methods of the middle ages by the announce ment that British soldiers are to be provided with suits of armor. It seems a pity that the result cannot be Jetermined by an old-fashioned joust. "We denounce the profligate waste of money wrung from the people by oppressive taxation through the lav ish appropriations of recent Repub lican Congresses which have kept taxes high and have reduced the pur chasing power of the people's toil. We demand a return to that simplic ity and economy which befits a dem ocratic government and a reduction in the number of useless offices, the salaries of which drain the substance of the people." The above pledge made in the Democratic platform of 1912 is in teresting when considered in ronnec tion with the recent unprecedented expenditures of Congress and the estimates of the higher cost of run ning the government during the fis cal year ending June 3o, 1918, sub mitted to Congress Monday by Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo. Apparently the' Democrats are not any more capiable of fulfilling pledges than the Republicans and the failure of both parties to keep their prom ises rapidly is convincing the voter to place no faith in political pledges.

Wie's Messge President Wilson's address. to Con gress was brief in words vad in the legislative program which it outlined. Those who expected the President to treat the high cost of living as the vital question of the day and make some recommendation looking to re lief from the situation with which the whole country is grappling were disappointed. Representative Fitz gerald, of Brooklyn, sponsor for food embargo legislation and other draltic measures designed to furnish a rem edy for high prices, showed his dis appointment in a statement which he made after the President's address. Others who expected the President to make definite recommendations for the standardization of salaries of gov eminent employes, with perhaps a word on 'retirement legislation, lie tened in vain for such passages. Their hopes now center in a special mes sage based on the facts procured by Federal investigators probing the ' --h cost of living. rhe body of the message is a se ,uel to the railroad legislation of the last session. First, the President re iterates his belief in the necessity of enlarging the personnel of the Inter state Commerce Commission by the addition of two new mcmbers. This increase to nine members will make it possible to effect changes in the administrative methods that long have been deemed desirable. The preliminaries to such enabling legis lation alr'eady have Jeen completed and there is no prospect that the rec ommendation will meet any concerted opposition in Congress. President Wilson declines to lend his support to compulsory arbitra tion and contends that the Interstate Commerce Commission has full au thority to raise railroad rates if the revenues of carriers are found to be inadequate. In his attitude both the brother hoods and the railroad may find cause for thanksgiving. It is a very concise message and does not present features that pre sage a bitter fight in Congress. The discussion of the Adamson law has furnished members with much infor mation on the subjects on which they now mut legislate and the entire program probably will be passed in accordance with the President's wishes. The Sufragist Banner. "Mr. President, what will you do for woman's suffrage?" These were the words inscribed on a banner that was dropped on a gal lery railing in the House of Repre sentatives yesterday while President Wilson was delivering his message to Congress. The banner was unfurl ed by a party of six well-known suf fragists, members of the Congression al Union for Woman Suffrage. The President smiled, a page took posses sion of the banner, policemen took stations near the suffragists to see that they indulged in no further dem onstrations and the incident was end ed. The act may be described as ap proaching closer to the militant methods of the English suffragettes than any demonstration made by the suffragists of this country in many months. The suffragists must have awakened some admiration for their courage in trespassing upon the for mality attendant upon the delivery of a Presidential message. They also may win plaudits for their devotion to the cause of votes for women. But when the question of the real material value of their action is given consideration, the suffragists may be given more censure than praise. It is very doubtful if the unfurling of the banner, interrupting the Chief Execu tive's address, will result in any bene fit to the cause of the suffragists. Perhaps the chief result of such a demonstration, novel and yet harmless in the final analysis, will be a lash of rather undesirable publicity which will smack of what is known as notoriety. The Commissioners have asked Congress to add forty more men to the police force. The wisdom of the request easily may be found in the daily reports of robberies, hold-ups, attacks on women and other. crimes. The lKational Guard, also, Is not get ting the recruits necessary to bring It up to the strength provided for in the army bill and without which the money appropriated for its support can not be given it. Even with the added induce mnent of actual service. enough recruits could not be had by the regiments that went to the. border to fll their ranks. Many regiments were only half strength. The Missouri regiments which have comne hohne were of that- class. Other regiments still en the border are equally denicient. What are we going to do about it? P~aaps It Is this situation that led to the unofficial statement in the "Washington News,' that Imeident Wil 5on has-been converted to a belief In the. necssty of universal trainingeand liabil Ity for service.-st.

WIgg be urged opnCmas at its alent se-. ase, dea Which the s.jeet et LdUW I-' my own"Q BETT;mw A shoittle ago there appeared in the A~leMonthly an article en ledf enty Min o Ralty. The article sets forth an experience of the author while he was co ing in a hospital after a surgical operation. It w a gray March day with a cloudy sky.. - ere was nothing un usually exciting or exhilarating in the convalescent's immediate atmos phere or environment, when suddenly e felt as if he had been translated to a new world of light, happiness, and Joy. "I cannot say what the mysterious change was" he said. "I saw no new thing, but I saw all the usual things in a miraculous new light-in what I believe is their true light. I saw for the first time how wildly beautiful and joyous, beyond any words of mine 'tO describe, is the whole of life. Every human being moving across that porch, every spar row that flew, every branch tossing in the wind, was caught in and was a part of the whole ecstasy of loveli ness, of joy, of importance, of intoxi cation, of life. ... For those glorified moments I was in love with every living thing before me-the trees in the wind, the little birds flying, the nurses, the internes the people who came and went. There was not'sing that was alive that was not a miracle. Just to be alive was in itself a mir acle. My very soul flowed out of me in a great joy." If it is possible to live in a world of happiness and beauty for twenty minutes, is it not possible to prolong the time-to live always in such a world? Lincoln said that "folks are usu ally about as happy as they make up their minds to be.' The experience of the writer in the Atlantic Monthly -as well as thousands of others that might be cited-shows that the possi bilties of happiness are inside, not outside, of us. The great mass of people do not extract 1o per cent of the happiness possible n their everyday life, largely because they were never trained to think of the normal sources of enjoy ment. Their minds are blank, except for the little grooves which their daily routine has stamped in their brain tissue. They are as ignorant of their possible mental resources as the.early Indians were of the natural resources of this continent, when the Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock. They raised just enough barley to exist upon. The did not know how to feed, to e, or to enjoy themselves. Their minds were blank. and they lived in wretchedness, while the vast resources of the richest continent in the world were all unknown to them Ruskin said he was not so much surprised at what we suffer as at what we lose, which might furnish infinite pleasure and satisfaction. We hear a great deal about the enormous loss of our natural resources, the coal, the waterpower, and the forests, but they are nothing compared to the tremendous loss in the possible re sources of happiness all around us. The things which really make life worth living are very common, very ordinary and within the reach of all. How often we hear the poor berat ing the rich whom they envy, bemoan ing the cruel fate that has kept about everything worth while away from them, but when we stop to take stock of life in the things that are really worth while, that count for most, we are pretty nearly all on an equal foot The great Chemist himself has mixed the atmosphere so that it is just adapted to create health, vigor, robustness of body and thought and exultant feeling for all alike. The sunlight with its marvelous chemistry performs millions of miracles every moment in root and rootlet, in plant and flower, in tree, in animal life, in human life, while painting pictures of marvelous colorings, in flower, in plant, in landscape. The poorest, the humblest person on earth has the same amount of time as the proudest monarch or the greatest money king. Andrew Car negie said he would give $bo.oooooo to have his life prolonged ten years; but all his wealth cannot purchase, one instant of time. Nor has money power to purchase the best things in life-love, friendship, sympathy. The sweetest, the most desirable things we know are purchasable only with effort, with conduct, right thought, ri ht effort. If, like Pollyanna in the play of the same name which all New York is flocking to see, we make a habit of looking for something to be glad about, we shall very soon master the secret of happiness. We shall master the art of real living. When railroad managers' and stockhold ers assume a friendly attitude toward the proposition of goverpment ownership of railroads it is time for the general public to become suspicious. For the managers would not think of government owner ship except as a wild-eyed scheme to de nouinee and oppose if they were not be ginning to think that the game isn't worth the candle. The financial powers which have stood behind the throne of railroad managers wouldn't permit a rep resentative of their. to hint at govern mnent ownership unless other line, of in dustry were more attractive, more profit able and less of a strain upon financial resources. In short, the joy of running a railroad Is running out, railroads as an investment are taking seats in the rear.-Toledo Blade. The Germans aren't beaten yet.

Ru mania, which wasn to have turned the tide definitely toward the entente, seems due for the fate of Belgium, Serbia and Mon tenegro.

"The, department is not unmindful of the urgent necessity that prompts many of these applications for discharge. anG under ordinary conditions the reasons 00 which they are based would readily be deemed sufcient to justify favorable action. But unfortunately, the applica tions are so numerous and are increasing so rapidly that favorable consideratior.! of all of them would disrupt many militia units and greatly impair the effciency of the service. No just or equitable basis for discrimination has been found upon a careful consideration of the numerous applications thus ' received, and the Secretary of War has ben constrained, in simple fairness to all concerned. and in order to avoid the discrimination that would be involved ir. granting any individual application, to adopt a strict rule that all of the ap plicants must be treated alike, and that no application of this nature shall be favorably entertained."
