For the ma ,,,,.1 it consists of good citizens, al 'though among it are a few men who do the territory no credit. New York yellow journals have found out that sixty-two pounds of turkey were consumed at the White house last Thanksgiving day. Great is New York and greater are Its yellow sheets. The New Mexican is of the opinion that the new governor of Oklahoma, Thompson B. Fergusson, will make a success of it. He is a good newspaper man and that is greatly in his favor. Under the new constitution the state of Alabama will not have very fre quent elections, but when it does have n,,o it will go Just exactly as the men in official position and power want it to go. An agricultural bureau has been es tablished in the Philippine Islands and Professor Scribner has been appointed its head. At present, however, rifles are more in demand in the Philippine isl ands than are plows. The senators and representatives in the 57th congress from the great state of Texas are opposed to the passage of hill providing for an enabling act for New Mexico. This was to be expected. But New Mexico will nevertheless make its fight for statehood and the chances for success in this line are very gooa Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania, has introduced a bill for the regulation of immigration into the United states.

Delegate Dennis Flynn of Oklahoma, Is to have considerable to say m Okla homa appointments. It may be pre sumed that the same policy will be ex tended to New Mexico and that Dele gate B. S. Rodey will be asked for his recommendation for applicants to of flce. In this case it Is reasonable to suppose that nearly all the present fed eral officials -will succeed themselves in New Mexico. Three Filipinos who had talten the oath of allegiance to the United States and who had been appointed to official positions in their town, but who turned traitors and murdered three peaceful Filipinos because they refused to pay toll to insurgents, were hanged In Ma nila a few days ago. A few more les sons of that kind will doubtless have a salutary effect In the Philippine Isl ands. An Indian school superintendent has ordered that all pupils of the grammar and high schools should read President T?nBPvplt's message. That is a good man and will give the pupils an Idea of civics and political economy which they cannot acquire too early. As a lesson in clear, forceful English, free from man nerisms and stilted effort, the message is also a gem that can be studied with profit in every school room. a Pittsburg physician has discovered a .serum for the cure of lockjaw, which is an event that may be called the greatest thus far of the new century. The number of cases of lockjaw with fatal termination seems to have been Increasing from year to year and a cure for that terrible disease is a great bles sing to humanity Indeed, In fact, al most as great a blessing as the discov ery of vaccination as a preventative of smallpox. - The Industrial commission that has been In session for a couple of years desires Its existence prolonged. Cer tainly, If not, why not? Its members are drawing their pay per diem and traveling allowances with commenda ble regularity and precision and have a soft time of It. Uncle Sam is a ben evolent old fellow and should prolong their soft snap. Not that the members of the commission desert it or are do ing anything for their pay, but be oause they ask it Grover Cleveland has succeeded in accumulating $250,000, or just about as much as President McKinley left at the time of his death. It seems that being president does not pay near as well as being a successful stock broker. i The Democratic managers and the Democratic legislators of Missouri are very hostile and very much opposed to all sorts of trusts and money octopi. j They fight these powerful combinations of capital by getting all the money pos sible out of them and then by passing such legislation for them as they want. The state of Missouri Is a great state ; and its Democratic campaign managers and Its legislators are great at making money. Colonel Bryan, in his paper the Com moner, complains that many, many hundreds of people were hungry on last Thni.kfirivlne dav. Now why didn't the colonel turn himself loose and give some of the blooded stock he has on I is farm for a Thanksgiving dinner to tone of the poor and needy in Ne braska. A farmer like Colonel Bryan who can afford to pay $3.0CO for blooded heifers, can surely afford to give somc .hins to these poor and needy people f..i whom he claims to have greac m licitude. New Mexico acquitted itself very well at the meeting of the National Live stock association In Chicago last week. It was ably represented and Its dele gales there did good work. A resolu tion concerning statehood for New Mexico was unanimously auopicu thfl national lease law project received a black eye, its advocates not having strength enough in the meeting to bring it up for action. Hon. soiomui. T.una was re-elected a member of the executive committee for New Mexico, and one of the delegates who did es pecially good work for New Mexico was L. O. Fullen of Carlsbad. The reappointment of Albert W. Thompson as receiver, and Edward J. Fox as register of the federal land oi flce at Clayton, Union county, is a source of gratification to the Republi cans, in fact, to all good citizens ot New Mexico. Messrs. Thompson and Fox are men of integrity, who have served the government and the public well .and faithfully in their respective offices. They were endorsed for reap pointment by Delegate B. S. Rodey ana the Republican organization of New Mexico and naturally were reappointed although there were other applicants for the two places. Congressman Crumpacker of Indiana, will introduce a bill in the house of rep resentatives, having for its object the reduction of the representation in con gress from the several southern states that lw tVmir mischievous and unfair legislation are depriving many of their citizens of the right of suffrage on ac count of the race question. Such a bill, if enacted, would be but fair and prove of benefit. Take for instance, the state of Mississippi, In the last few years it has cast less votes for its several con gressmen than the territory of New Mexico has cast for its one delegate. This state of affairs, of course, should be remedied. A census bulletin just issued reviews the status of the salt industry in the United States. Fifteen states and one territory are enumerated as producing salt, one state, Massachusetts, produc ing but 9S0 barrels of salt in the year 1900, but one vainly looks for the name of New Mexico as a producer of salt or having such a thing as a salt deposit or a salt lake. Of course, everyone conversant with the resources of the territory, knows that New Mexico's salt lands and salt lakes are very ex tensive and that they are considerable producers of a domestic supply of salt, but in this as In so many other instanc es, the census does New Mexico as fla grant injustice. Bourke Cockran thinks that Presi dent Roosevelt can and ought to stop the warfare in South Africa. Perhaps he also thinks that King Edward can and should stop the guerilla fighting in the Philippines. If President Roose velt and King Edward would make such attempts it would be mighty pleasing to the thrashed Boers and the vanquished Aguinaldoites, but as to stopping the warfare it would only start a new war and kindle the flame of in surrection in South Africa as well as in the Philippine islands to greater fury. Statesmen of the Bourke Cockran type will do to thrill an audience with their eloquence, but as to practical states manship, their ideas are very crude and visionary. The intimation of Attorney General Knox to federal ottlcenoiaers umi mc, had better retire from active political leadership while holding office has had the effect in Colorado and elsewhere of bringing a great deal of new blood to the top and the old guard holding fed eral office is retiring from party posi tions if not from party management. This is probably as it should be for a man In public service should devote all of his working time to his duty as a non-partisan official who must serve Republicans and Democrats alike. He need not therefore give up his In fluence nor should his counsel In party matters be despised or put aside, hut the active party management should be left to those not making a living by public office holding. An Industry That Pays. The Utah Beet Sugar company, will declare an extra dividend of 20 per cent or J3O0,00O this year. This will be In addition to the regular 12 per cent dividend paid this year, making a to tal of J480.0OO received by the stockhol ders from one year's operations. Dur ing the past three years the company has also spent out of the earnings, $500,000 for improvements at its plant, and $300,000 in purchasing lands and ir rigation works. Its gross earnings this year are $1,000,000 on a capital stock of $1,500,000. The company has a plant at Lehi and auxiliary plants at Spring- field. Provo and West Jordan. That shows how the culture of sugar beets and the manufacture of beet sugar can be made to pay in favorable localities, such as Lehi In Utah, and such as the Santa Fe. Rio Grande. Animas andi other localities in northern New Mexi co would be if beet sugar plants were erected in this section. IP- K V ( 

ALBERT W. Receiver of Public Money at the United County, New Albert W. Thompson, yesterday re appointed by President Roosevelt - as receiver of the federal land oitice at Clayton, Union county, was born at Belfast, Maine, May 17, 1864. He atten ded the public schools of his native state and when quite young, on ac count of ill health, he was sent to Col orado, where he entered Colorado Col lege at Colorado Springs in 1884. After a year's study, ill health compelled him to abandon his proposed college educa tion and to take up active outdoor life. In 18S9 he entered the sheep and real estate business at Clayton ' in Union county. He served as secretary of the THE 

BRIDGE OVER THE CANADIAN. It Has Been Completed and Trains Are Passing'Over It. Railway Age. In connection with the new line of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific now being built from Liberal, Kas., to Car rizozo, New Mexico, a bridge of impor tance has been built over the Canadian river In New Mexico. In its erection methods were-employ-ed of considerable interest and some what different from the plan generally used in work of this kind. The bridge is 769 feet in length and spans the river at a height of 135 feet at its highest point. It is a single track structure supported on six steel piers, and consists of seven spans 80 feet in length and six spans of 35 feet, the shorter spans having the same length as the tops of the towers in the direc tion of the length of the bridge. The structural work on the bridge includes 1,710,000 pounds of soft steel, and was built by the American-Chicago branch of the American Bridge company. The bridge throughout is of the deck girder type, the girders used measuring 9 feet in height from back to back of angles and placed 8 feet apart. The bridge rests on six steel towers, each of which is built on a foundation of four pedestals of concrete, varying in height at different points along the bridge. The towers are all 8 feet wide and 35 feet in length at the top; the same length of the towers being main tained from top to bottom, while the sides from the top slope with a batter of one in six, thus determining the spacing of the piers at the base. On the top of each leg of the towers a plate 2 feet 6 Inches square is riveted, which serves as a cap, and on which the girders rest. The girders at the fixed ends are riveted to the towers, while the expansion ends are fastened by means of anchor bolts in slotted holes. In the locality in which the bridge is built, timber is very scarce, and to have employed false work in the erec tion of the superstructure would have necessitated considerable expense and time in bringing the required materials to the site. In view of these conditions it was decided to dispense, if possible, with the extensive false work which would have been required in a bridge of this height. Accordingly a new method was employed In the raising of the superstructure, which, it Is said, has never before been used on a bridge of this size. Two cables were stretched ten feet apart from one side of the gorge to the other, and on these trolley systems were fitted up for conveying the materials to be used in the towers from the cars to their proper positions in the bridge. The cables used were ' 1,000 feet in length, 1 1-2 Inches in dia meter, and were stretched by means of hoisting engines. They were anchored on one side in solid rock and on the other by means of four 12x12 inch tim bers, placed back of six piles driven in to the ground. The pull on the anchor ages was estimated at 85,000 pounds. To these cables a platform was at tached having a backward and for ward motion along the cables, and which at the time could be made sta tionary in any position. In the build ing of a tower, this platform was fixed In position a short distance be yond the site, and served as a means for holding the pulleys through which the cables of the trolley systems used were run. A separate trolley was ar ranged for each cable and was so de signed that the structural material could be run out from the embankment or completed portion of the bridge to the tower under construction, and there raised or lowered as desired. When a tower had been completed, two men were sent out to the platform i where the device grasping the cables -was loosened and the platform pulled along to the position desired for work on the next tower and there fastened. Bg the use of this method, no false THOMPSON States Land umce at ayxon, Um Mexico. Republican county central committee of Union county, and since his advent into the territory has done efficient and successful work for the Republican party. In 1897 he was appointed by President McKinley receiver of public money at the United States land office at Clayton, an office which he filled for the past four years to the entire sat isfaction of all concerned and with efficiency and honesty. He was married in 1899 to Miss Win ston of Albuquerque, and he and Mrs. Thompson are among the prominent residents of Clayton where they are both well liked. work whatever was necessary, and there was provided a rapid and very satisfactory means for conducting the work. After the towers were comple ted, the girders were placed in position in the usual way by the use of a trav eler. The traveler used was run on rails spaced 10 feet center to center and laid on either side of the rails in the track. It was equipped with a 25 horse power hoisting engine and two booms 60 feet in length. The platform on which the hoisting engine rested was 13 feet above the rails, leaving an open space 10x13 feet through the traveler, through which the girders and other structural material were brought for ward to tie carried by the booms or trolleys to their positions in the bridge. In the construction of the sub-structure, unusual conditions were encoun tered, as mentioned in the recent arti cle referred to, in that everything used in the work, including cement, pile, pile-drivers, boilers, engines, material for coffer-dams, etc., was hauled for a distance, of 80 miles across the sandy country characteristic of that locality. The substructure included in all two
