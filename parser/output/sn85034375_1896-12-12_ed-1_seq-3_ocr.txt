While they are stand ing still in a material way, possibly from lack of energy or something else, their State is forging her way to tbe front ahead of most of her eister States The State Is For gleg Ah§d4: of tbe Union, and unless something oc curs to retard her onward march she will soon become one of tbe leading States In the grand Southern galaxy, In wblob she has not heretofore—at least •lace the war—been a very bright mem ber in the matter ol enterprise and progress. Inh summing up of the recent report of tbe postmaster general it is found that tbe whole southern section of tbe Union is advancing in a much greater ratio than is either tbe North, East or West. It is to be observed that there has been no great net increase in the number of postofHces established in 1896, tbe additional offices created being 896, but of these more than 35 per cent, were in tbe five Southern States, Missis sippi, Arkansas, Texas, Georgia and Kentucky. It is significant that in tbe States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Penn sylvania and New York all taken to gether only a little more than a third as many now postoffices were estab lished—enough to satisfy all but those who want to be postmasters. It is sur prising to find that more new offices were established in the one State of Mississippi than in the four Northwest ern States of Montana, Washington and the two Dakotas.. Those facts point unmistakably to tbe direction in which capital and population are traveling.

Aberdeen and Tennessee Railroad. "Of all tbe railroads, present and pros pective, that our city has or hopes to have, the Aberdeen & Tennessee River railroad will be the most valuable to ber local trade and do most to advance her commercial and manufacturing in terests. Its completion will give Aber deen at once an immense transfer busi ness in tbe line of lumber and timber supplies, and open up to its trade a re gion of country in evory respect desira ble and upon which It now has but a slender hold and where it finds numer ous rivals. "The building of this road will accen tuate tbe demand that we think is now appreciated at headquarters for the ear ly completion of tbe Aberdeen division of the Illinois Central to its eastern con nection, and we believe it will also re sult in the Mobile & Ohio being com pelled to push its branch to the Ala bama coal fields, and if both of these prophesies come true the Kansas City, Memphis & Birmingham railroad may find it necessary to substitute a loop line, giving direct Aberdeen connection for the Arnory branch. The building of the Aberdeen & Tennessee railroad means wealth, importance, large popu lation and general and substantial pros perity for our city.—Aberdeen Examiner A Swindler Caught. Some time in September a man named W. R. Flannigan, swindled several peo ple in this city in a slick manner and made bis escape. Through the untir ing efforts of Dotective John Horne he was finally located in Nashville, Tenn., where he was tinder arrest for stealing, an account ot which appeared in these columns at the time, and for which offense he was "sent-up."

Mrs. M. D. V. Leonard is, as Senator Walthall's letter indicates, a Mississip pian, having at one time been a resident of Vicksburg. She is a niece of the Confederate general, Earl Van Dorn. The portrait is a magnificent one by F. J. Fisher, a celebrated artist of Wash ington, and is pronounced by those who knew Justice Lamar best to be tbe finest likeness of him yet transferred to can vas. It portrays the great Mississip pi in bis robes as one of the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, and gives a faithful reproduc tion of him as he appeared at the zenith of his greatness. Every feature is ex act, and in gazing upon it one feels that it is not an inanimate picture, but Jus tice Lainar himself. It is in a very heavy gilt frame, which sets off its fine points to great advantage. It has not been hung yet, but will be in a day or bo. Following is Senator Walthall's letter to tbe governor: "To the Governor of Mississippi: "Dear Sir—Mrs. M. D. V. Leonard and Mr. Wra. D.

"To testify their appreciation of his services to his country and his people and his kindness to themselves, they have had this portrait pre pared by a skilled artist and it is their desire, if allowable and agreeable, that it may be bung in our State library. "In asking accepted I venture, on my the hope that it may be considered appropriate by the board of trustees of the library, over which you preside, to comply with their wishes, (which they do not impose as a condition), touching the disposition of the portrait. "Yours very truly, E. C. Walthall." The governor's reply is as follows: "Jackson, Miss., Dec. 3,1896. "Hon. E. C.

PRESS AND PEOPLE Comment TJ*p^ n Text of the President's ».5 e S8 a ff*, Wtih Widely Varying Opinions, Din qA the Whole Both the Matter and the Mrfn m*r off the Document is Satisfactory ssd Sell Received Everywhere. Spirit of the Chicago Press. Cfil&ao, Die. 8.—'The editors of Chi cago morning papers will comment on the pre»i&ent'» message as fellows: Time^-Herald (independent): pnly the uw>st urgent friends of Cuba can complain off the tone ot that part of the presi dents message devoted lo the relations of tbs United States with Spain, it lacks neither boldness nor clearness, bat it' is appreciative of the duty of this governmeotyto preserve its pledges and maintain the peace' and prosper ity of its people. No one will dissent from the president's views with reference to the need of remedying certain admitted delects iu - monetary system. Those who are fami lar with the obstinate and inflexible eharacter of the president's temperament did not expect that his message would disclose any evidences of a change of sentiment on the revenue question. Record (independent): That part of the president's message which treats of the Cuban rebellion outlines a policy which the subsequent administration may have to recognize aud adopt as providing the only just and dignified way out of the diffi culty. The passage is logical In thought and singularly clear In style. His threat to Spain —for the conditions on which it Is based do not make it any the less a threat—will present to the European powers a very clear view of this nation's attitude. The whole passage outlines a policy in which a tine deference to diplo matic expediency is not allowed to bar the way for definite and vigorous action when it shall be necessary. Inter-Ocean (republican): It is far from being a sensational document. There is a deal of indefinable discussion about Cuba. Grover Cleveland Illustrates the law of heredity by a strong penchant for preach ing. only his homilies are baaed on current events for texts The most remarkable fea ture of the message is the defense of the Wii son-Gorman bill. All this means, practically, this congress need not pass the Dingloy bill, for the president does not propose to be a party to any change in the revenue legislation of the country. The president is joined to free trade, and should be let alone. The only im portant subject the president shows a disposi tion to take up is the Pacific railroad ques tion. . The Tribune (republican); Regarding the Cuban question the message is in the nature of a timeserver and make shift. It tries to throw off all responsibility from the shoulders of the present administra tion and load it upon the back of the incoming administration. The president has not the nerve to do Its duty, and he leaves it for his successor to perform. The Tribune indorses the president's deliverance on retiring the green backs, aud on "revenue aud tariff'' says: The tariff act of 1894. which President Cleve land refused to sign because of its "incon sistencies and crudities," seems to 9uit him perfectly now. He thinks it has benefited the people and he is not disturbed by its short coming*. ■i and liepreseuta Expressions by Seoul fives. Washington, Dec. 8.— Neither sen ate nor house had a {food opportunity of judging of the president's message by the public reading of it. Members and senators were very chary in their comments afterwards, pressed themselves as follows: Congressman Grosvenor (rep., 0.): The treatment of the Cuban and other for A few ex eitfri matters will not be satisfactory to those who have earnestly hoped for the early action of our country in the Interest of an early ces sation of the wholesale murder In the unhappy island of Cuba. The discussion of the Cuban apology for delay taking of a question is rather and non-action than the stand and decisive position. The reference to the tariff if far from satisfactory, aud that portion of the message which treats of the spoils system would be better understood aud more fully appreciated if the president had frankly stated that he and his department offi cers had within the past four years swept out 30,000 faithful und efficient employes of the gov ernment for no reason save that they publicans, and had tilled their places with inexperienced and non-competent applicants, unfit for all democrats, and all of whom w the places they got, and all of whom w warded for partisanship either or their friends; and then that the shield of the civil service law has been used to perpetu ate their tenure. themselves Francis G. Xewlands (sil., Nev.) said that no substautial relief, he thought, could be secured by multiplying prom ises to pay gold iu the shape of bunk notes. The only thing to do was to recognize the fact that there was not enough gold to do the world's business and to restore bimetallism. Speaker Reed said: "It seems hardly necessary to comment upon tone, and the the message. It is calm Cuban question will be much more satisfactory to the community than it would have beeu a year ago. 1 wish there had been as frank au acknowledgment of the deficit a year ago as there 1 b now. The idea that the revenue Is sufficient, being made so by borrowing, seems to be hardly tenable. Mr. McMilliu (deni., Tenn.) thinks we can safely urge home rule or local self-government for Cuba. He is will ing to go even further. He does not approve the president's recointuenda tiou for the retirement of greenbacks by au issue of bonds. Mr. Canuon (rep., 111.) said: Everything demonstrates the absolute ne cessity for revenue legislation that will briug increased receipts. Upon the Cuban question he thought from his hasty reading of the message that congress should await executive action and reoommendations us to Cuba. Gen. "Joe" Wheeler (dera., Ala.) said he believed a decided, firm stand with regard to Cuba would receive the approval of the civilised world. Mr. McCreary (dcm.) said: I ain pleased with the president's reference to the Cuban and Venezuelan questions and the tariff. While I sympathize with the Cu ban patriots, and hope some day to see Cuba a free and independent republic. Ido not ex pect the president, term. might seriously Interrupt the friendly rela tions exist! ig between us and Spain, or whloh might loud to war. Mr. Taft (rep., O.) said: The president has stated the position of the United States forcibly. He shows that we have responded to all the duties demanded by International law. What he says may be con sidered as a notice to Spain that the present condition cannot continue indefinitely. The president leaves It an open question whether or uot he will interfere.

The inhabitants of the lower Missis4 sippi valley may boon have an oppor* tunity of beholding several of the big war-ships of the Atlantic squadron Without going far from home. The present intention of the secretarj^ of the navy is to send several of the big ships and several of the gun boats, also, to New Orleans for the carnival. The people of Orleans have been peti tioning the navy department for years to have some of the modem battleships sent to their city as » feature of the annua! Mardi Gras fes tivities, but heretofore their petitions* have been in vain. Now, however,. Secretary Herbert is more inclined to* accede to their request, Should the* stage of the water in the Mississippi be favorable it is likely that one or two of the gunboats will be ord-ered aa> far as Vicksburg or Memphis. country's only prospect ot trouble is with Spain over r Cuba, and as, in the event of war,, the fighting would all be done off Cuba, tike war ships would be within easy sail of the scenv ol the conflict. When there is a prospect of w ar it is advisable that the patriotism of the people should be fed on the food most calculated to keep it strong. There is nothing move ducive to an ebullition of national en thusiasm than the sight of the Stars and Stripes floating from the mast of such a thing of beauty and of terror as one of the great white ships which are the chief protection of the United States from the attack of a foreign foe. Masonic Honor* for On. Lee. There has only been one ease in Vir ginia where a nou-Freemason, or a "profane,* 1 has been made a mason "on sight.'* This honor can only be con ferred by the grand master, and is never done except in the rarest instances and for phenoinenally important reasons. Recently there has been strong >talk in Richmond of Gen. Fitzhugh Lee being made a mem ber of the order^'on sight" The only instance in Virginia where a person was made a mason "on sight" was in the case of Gen. Washington. Another of the few' in this country was the of the grand master of Mississippi. These and another were the only th cases in America where a "profaue - ' was "made a mason" w ithout submit ting to the customary ballots, proba tions and ancient rites of initiation. Sharp Demand for Alaba The rush of foreign orders for Ala bama pig iron has never before been equaled. The Sloss Iron and Steel Co., Birmingham, sold 8,000 tons to a firm in Calcutta, India.

Genoa aud other European points, aggre gating 30,000 tons. The ability of Ala bama furnaces to undersell European competitors, aud at the same time fur nish a high-grade article of iron, ac counts for the growing demand. Ala bama iron masters say their only trouble is inability to secure boat room for shipments because of the heavy grain and cotton move: Were it not for this they say their for eign trade would be much larger.
