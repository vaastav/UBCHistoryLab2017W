PART TWO VOLUME GIX— NO. 9. SPIRIT THAT REMADE LEVELED CITY BORN ANEW AT BUSINESSMEN'S BANQUET Merchants Association Declare for One and a Greater Municipality on Shores Golden Gate ADVANTAGES OF A CONSOLIDATED CITY NOTED Banquet Board Rings With Cheers as Speakers Point Out Good to Accrue Reduction in Tax Rates and Other Gains Are Told in Convincing Speeches The future San Francisco — the greater city that is to be — was toasted last night by the Merchants' associa tion, g-athered 650 strong at the annual banquet of the organization in the Xorman grill of the Fairmont hotel. The memory of many of those agth ered last night at the banquet board runs to another banquet of four years and a half ago. On that night the Merchants' association had its annual dinner of the year 1906. On that night the toast that was drunk and the toasts that were spoken from the hearts that were full were directed to a topic almost identical with the theme of last nighu The subject then was. "The New San Francisco — the City That Is to Be." That banquet of four and a half years ago was one that will Ive in the city's history. The tables were- laid in the blackened, barren, smoke stained ruins of what had ben the white and gold room of the St. Francis hotel. The men I at that banquet appeared in ordinary day attire, for evening dress was not to be had; many of the diners walked for a score or more of blocks through the ruins of a stricken city; that dinner was held in the midst of desolation — -^Jri the very heart of a metropolis laid waste. AGAIX THE TOAST IS REPEATED Almost 300 men gathered that night for the banquet held in the district that three months before had been wiped out by flames, and the toast of the 300 was to "The Xew San Francisco — the city that is to be." Last night those same <SOO, and more than as , many again, gathered in the banquet hall of the Fairmont, in the very center of the city that has been restored, and drank again the .health of San Francisco. There was this difference last night: The toast that prevailed was not 5 a toast to "the city that is to be," but a toast to "the city that is and to a greater San Francisco to come." Four years and a half ago 'the spirit that stirred the members of the Merchants' association was embodied in a vision ~^*"- a new city to arise from the ashes Jot the one that had.gone. Last night / the vision was broaJer. It was di | rected to a city that shall spread in every direction about . the shores of San Francisco bay; a city bustling with a new commerce brought to its gates by way of the Panama canal; a city of a million inhabitants bound together by a single tie of civic pride; a city standing in tTTo front rank of the cities «>f the world. WAST OXE AVI) A GREATER CITY Consolidation of the various munici palities about the shores of San Fran cisco bay was the subject to which all the speakers of last night directed their remarks. The old phrase, "the bay cities," was not spoken once last night, except as a phrase of identifica tion. In its place was a new phrase of more magnificent suggestion — "the boroughs of greater San Francisco." In every aspect, the proposed, consoli dation of San Francisco and its penin- Eular and transbay neighbors into a single great municipality was dwelt upon, and the enthusiasm that was sriven the proposed project was tre mendous. VOICE A XEW DREAM The men who four years and a half ago dared voice the dream of a re stored San Francisco, and largely through whose effdrts that dream has become a wonderful reality, voiced an other and greater dream last night. They spoke of it with the same indom itable spirit of accomplishment, the .same serene certainty of attainment. They went at it, too, in a businesslike manner. Even the envelopes in which the clgara were served at the banquet l n-ere covered with a printed collction \u25a0r f facts and figures taken from the < ecent census returns. They showed the population of San Francisco today, \u25a0with its 416,912 persons, and a table of the metropolitan population of the 1 cities and towns that would be included - in the proposed scheme of consolida tion — a combined population of 677,- E48 — the potential nucleus of a city of a million people. CAXAL PICTURES SHOWS In the enthusiasm over the projet of consolidation itself the causes of San Francisco's growth were not forgotten, nor were the contributing factors of future greatness overlooked. The com mercial aspect of the situation was gone into in detail and the various ele ments that must be reckoned with in the years to come were discussed at An object lesson of a forceful nature was given in the presentation of a fine *et of moving pictures showing the work upon the Panama canal. .The ranal itself and the benefits which it will bring to San Francisco were made the subject of an interesting address \>y Seth Mann, counsel for the traffic bureau of the merchants' exchange. The Panama-Pacific international ex position was referred to by every I speaker. At the close of the address by Seth Mann on "The Benefits to Our City Following the Opening:, of the Panama Canal,'" Charles W. Hornick called at tention to the loyal work for San Fran cisco being done by the exposition dele- Ration in Washington, and upon his motion, carried by a unanimous rising vote. President M. H. Robins Jr. of the Merchants' association was instructed to forward a • telegram to the Wash ington party -expressing the confidence and encouragement of those at the ban quet. \u25a0 - . .

By looking forward to the accomplishment, he said, the ac complishment could be hastened, and by a study of the tangible. things con nected -with such upbuilding the up building: could be made sure and last- Ing. Seth Mm mi reviewed the prodigious \u25a0work that has been accomplished by the federal government In the digging of the Panama canal and . pointed" to the benefits that . will accrue to ; Sari Francisco and its contiguous territory from the culmination of the project. He laid the chief stress upon the effect the opening of the canal will have on the. establishment of fair traffic rates, upon the influx of European white labor ."that» will result and upon the restoration of the American mer chant marine. 

PROFESSOR STEVEXS VOICES PLAX Prof. Henry Morse Stephens of the University of California won a; spon taneous ovation of the most sincere character by his address upon "The Consolidation. of Cities on the Borough System, With Special Reference to San Francis co and the Cities of the Bay Region." His summing up of the sit uation evidenced a long and thorough study of the problems presented, and was a sound, logical presentation of the facts, and at the same time an eloquent appeal. He decried the sentimental op position that has developed as the only serious protest against the proposed consolidation, and pointed out that a joining of the bay cities under the borough system would' be, in fact, a consolidation and not an annexation. A. H. ELLIOT SOLXDS APPROVAL Edward F. Treadwell, counsel for the greater San Francisco committee, discussed the phase of consolidation re lating.to the "Legislation Necessary at the 1911 Session of the Legislature to Enable Consolidation by 1915." His talk was addressed chiefly to the legal aspect of the matter and to the material and mechanical changes of civic gov ernment tha would be required. A. H. Elliott of the Oakland city council concluded the regular program of toasts with-an address upon ."The Advantages to Cities and Towns in Alameda County of Consolidation of All the Cities Around San Francisco Bay." He summed up in eloquent manner ;the chief arguments in favor of the pro posed consolidation, and showed the fallacy of the objections that have been raised by the opponents of the propo sition. SETH MANN DWELLS UPON GREAT BENEFITS Seth Mann's view of the general ad vantages to be- derived by San Fran cisco from the opening of the Panama canal covered thoroughly the trans portation problems that have been puz zling the west for years. He explained in detail and with . the conviction of long study how .the opening, of the canal would operate to -develop San Francisco and the Inland valleys" of California. . To benefit properly from these changed conditions he asserted that a greater San Francisco, was neces sary on the principle that 1,000 men with a single t purpose can attain more than one-man, no matter-how energetic or willing. '- ' . - , "The. fabled • labors of Hercules are stories for an idle* hour,* and the pyra-' mids of.Cheopssthe play, of children," said he, ."compared with this modern marvel of national power. ••- "In three years the canal will be an accomplished..f act, and: In^fdur years the ships of . the' world < may pass • In safety from sea to sea, 'and San Fran cisco will be 8,200 miles nearer toNew York In continuous: water transporta-' tion.

Prior to his introduction of the speakers he made the following re marks: " " \ . , _ ' No one; can become prosperous while he really expects, or half expects, to remain poor. No city can become great until its people, realize its possibilities and : the destiny. In . store for It. We tend to get what we expect, and to expect nothing. is to get nothing. While to expect great things is a long stride on the highway tor attain them. When every step a community takes is on the road to success and great ness, what can result save great achievement? The weaving of the web must follow the pattern. . . Opulence and prosperity can not come in through poverty thought and failure thought channels. They must first be mentally created and believed. The earth is full of resources, which we have scarcely. yet touched. The fact is -that we live in < our own; "world; we are creations of our own thoughts. We build this ;world" by our own thought habit. We can surround ourselves with an environment of .'„ abundance, or of lack, of- growth, or of standing still. We do - not expect half .enough of ourselves, or of the place in which we live.
