BACKS ROOSEVELT TYilliani Nelson Cromwell Makes a Sweeping Denial Of the Charges Made Regarding the Panama Deal. IT IS XOT HIS FIRST Made Practically Same State ment in the World In Its Issue of Oct. 3 of the Cur rent Year. New York, Dec. 11. William Nel son Cromwell has made a statement In which he said in part: "My attention has been called to a etatement Issued by the editor of the Indianapolis News In which he at tempts to reply to the charge made by President Roosevelt that certain state ments made in the Indianapelis News, both then and since the recent elec tion as relating to the purchase of the Panama canal by the U. S. were false and untrue. "The president said: " 'The News gives currency to the charge that the U. S. bought from American citizens for ,40.000.000 " lj vat .ncac uuicuo vwij. J 12,000,000. The statement is false, The United States did not pay a cent of the $40,000,000 to American citi zens', etc. "From the statement Issued in reply by the editor of the News I quote the following: "The only man who paid any atten tion to them, (that is the criticisms referred to, etc.) was Mr. Chas. P. Taft. who did deny that he was in anyway related to the affair. We had no word from the president or Air. Taft, the other men such as Crom well and Morgan who vere believed to have full information of the busi ness said nothing.' "And he attempts to justify the publication of the false statements ap pearing in his paper by saying that they "were based largely on statements of the New York World. Criticisms which were made over and over again during the campaign were utterly ig nored until today.' . Denied It Before. "The reply of the editor of the News furnishes another proof of the Justice of the president's character ization for in the very journal under whose sheets it now takes refuge. namely in the New York World of October 3. 1905 appears an explicit and unqualified denial by me of the Ftory referred to and in which I used the "following language: " "We may expect during a heated political contest all kinds of stories which are not worthy of notice but this one I wish to denounce in the strongest terms as a lying fabrication without a shadow of truth in it. Neither I nor any one allied with me, either directly or indirectly at any time or In any place in America or abroad, ever bought, sold, dealt in or ever made a penny of profit out of any stocks, bonds, or other securities of either the old Panama Canal com pany or the new Panama Canal com pany or ever received for the same a single dollar of the funds paid by the United States. I make this the most sweeping statement that language can convey.' "I again denounce the statement wherever published or by whom so ever made, that there was a syndicate formed by American citizens to pur chase the Panama canal and to sell it to the United States as absolutely and unqualifiedly false and untrue. The Americanization plan was an entirely different matter. It was a project proposed by the company to the rivers and harbors committee of the house to President McKinley on February 27, 1899, and was formally authorized by the board of directors October 10, 1S99, subject to the necessary ap proval of stockholders. The initial steps were taken by me fn October, November and December, 1899, and a company was formed for the purpose under the laws of New Jersey of carrying out the instructions of my client. While the certificate of in corporation of the Panama Canal company of America was filed in New Jersey no capital stock except the nominal capital of $5,000,000 set forth in the certificate of incorpora-1 tion was ever issued. Distribution of the 3Ioney. "Now with regard to the distribu tion of the $40,000,000 It has been made to appear in newspapers that there was some mystery connected with the disposition of the money. i ii iir in i u iim n i v ri (ill nrvfr nun been. The fund In question paid into j the Bank of France by the United! States produced the net sum of 206! 'V' i" -,i ; 1 lull's ii,n' 1 -iJ uie credit ti to the liquidator of the old Panama Canal company and 77,400, 000 francs being placed - to the credit of the new Panama Canal com pany In liquidation and by said bank paid over to said liquidators, re spectively pursuant to a decision of arbitration at Paris February 11, 1902 confirmed by the civil tribunal of the Seine. "Since the recent publications I have made inquiries in Paris and am Informed that the distribution of these moneys is a matter of public record; that the amount received by the liqui dator of the old Panama Canal com pany has been distributed by him as an officer of the court to the holders of the obligations of the old company. The complete and detailed record of these payments together with the names and receipts of every person to whom payment was made and the amount of such payment is in the hands of the liquidator at his offices. "As to the fund paid to the new Panama Canal company -that com pany at the -time of the sale of Its property to the United States went into liquidation and I am likewise recently Informed that the distribution of its assets among its shareholders was made through four leading banks of Paris. "Neither I nor my law firm nor any one connected with me ever owned, directly or indirectly, any share of stock in the new Panama Canal com pany, nor anv of the obligations or securities of the old Panama Canal company, nor ever bought or sold any j clubs in their respective cities, were spe of tli shares or securities of either j cial guests one of said companies, nor were direct ly or indirectly interested in them. No Public Man in It. "I am also positive that not a man in public life in America In or out of congress ever had the least pecuniary interest In the Panama canal. "I do not know and never have known of any American citizen who has ever dealt in any shares of the new Panama Canal company or the shareholder bonds of the old company. "A further instance of the unwar ranted attitude of the Indianapolis News and of other journals repeating the statements is furnished with re spect to Mr. C. P. Taft and Mr. Doug las Robinson. In the same issue of the World (October 3, 1908), I said: " 'The mention of the names of Mr. Taft and Mr. Douglas Robinson is an other evidence that this is a fake story. No member of the Taft family or Mr. Douglas Robinson ever had the re motest connection with Panama canal matters, directly or indirectly, and I never saw one of them on this subject before the United States acquired the canal. I never saw Mr. Douglas Rob inson in my life.' "The whole story of Americans or some American syndicate buying up the Panama canal securities at a low price or at any price and then turning them in upon liquidation at a profit is a fic tion and a concoction. The money of the United States went to France and was distributed to the hundreds of thousands of foreign owners, none of whom, so far as I know were Ameri cans." Mr. Cromwell's statement was shown to Henry W. Tatt, brother of the president-elect and half brother of Chas. P. Taft. He read it carefully and then wrote the following statement: "Neither mv hrother Charles nor I nor any member of our family directly or indirectly had any interest or made j naTcanal by our KmentT None or us w-as interested aireciiy ur mui rectly, in any syndicate or underwrit fnp iinvin? anv stock or interest in the stock of any company whicn ever nu anvthine to do with the Panama ca nal. None of us had any connection directly or indirectly, with any of the transactions leading up to the trans fer of the canal to our government." FOK 

CRIMINAL UBEL. President Threatens Suits Against Critics of Canal Deal. Washington, Dec. 11. "If they can be reached for criminal libel I shall try to have them reached." said President Roosevelt . in speaking about "those Americans who have been guilty of infamous falsehood concerning the acquisition of the property and the construction of the Panama canal itself." It was to the committee of 100 of the lakes to the gulf deep waterway association headed by Governor Deneen of Illinois received by the president in the east room of the White House that he made his declaration. Governor Deneen has presented a copy of the resolution adopted by the association and made a few re marks to which the president re plied as follows: "I have felt, as the governor has so well put it that no more important service could be rendered to this country than the building of the Panama canal between the Atlantic and the Pacific and one thing I am proud of In connection with the build ing of that canal is that there has not been legitimate cause for the breath of scandal connected with any feature of the proceedings. We have cause to be ashamed of only one set of Americans in connection with the building of the canal and that is of those Americans who have been guilty of infamous falsehood concerning the acquisition of the property and the construction of the canal Itself. If they can be reached for criminal libel I shall try to have them reached. If not, at any rate all the facts we know or ever have known are at the dis position of each and every one of you here and of any one In congress or of all congress if they wish to see them. "Next only in importance from the physical standpoint to building the Panama canal comes the question of developing the use of our own water ways. That must be done by the policy of irrigation at the headwaters up in the arid regions; and where you come from, gentlemen, it is to be done by making our seacoast lake a big loop In from the gulf of Mexico to the great lakes: and we will see that that work is done just as honestly. just as efficiently as the Panama canal ! uin ii.i-i ui t ii uunt ana no wont could have been done from beginning to end more honestly or more efficiently." 

WALLACE RESIGNS. Violaters of "Sunday Law May Now Oet a Kept. Jefferson City; Mo., Dec. 11. Gov. Folk has received the resignation of Judge Wm. H. Wallace of the crim inal court. Judge Wallace's commis sion as judge of the criminal court of Kansas City expired on November 3. At the regular election his successor was named but the judge refused to vacate the bench Judge Wallace gained national fame during his term of office as criminal judge by his campaign against Sun day theaters. As a result most of the best known vaudeville and burlesque actors as well as hundreds of those in the "legitimate" were indicted. Dur ing the campaign two thousand per sons were indicted for Sunday labor. The bonds which the judge forced the offenders to give amounted to over i one and a half million dollars. His efforts to make Kansas City a closed town on Sunday, were founded on a Jaw placed on the Missouri statute books over fifty years ago, and which had never before been enforced. PARADE COST $57,431. An Item of Expense in Taft Campaign Made Public. New York. Dec. 11. Nearly sixty thousand dollars J57.431 to be exact, was spent on the business men's parade for Taft and Sherman held in New York Just before the national election. The figures were made public at a banquet given by the Business Men's Republican ass(:ia tion in an uptown restaurant. The banciuet was an informal affair. John V.

War- r&n cf TlnfTnln nil nrpsidpnta of Tni't GETTY 0PENS OP. Files Suit in Supreme Court for Seat in Senate. Asks for a Writ of -Mandamus Against County Officers. WANTS THE BALLOTS. County Clerk Refused to Pro duce Them. To Secure Evidence Before Leg islature ConTenes. Senator James F. Getty, of Wyan dotte county, today filed papers with the supreme court asking for a per emptory writ of mandamus against the county clerk and probate judge of Wy- andotte county compelling them to pro. duce and open the ballots of the last general election in the probate court where the senator is prosecuting his election contest against T. A. Milton, Democrat, who was elected senator from the Fourth district on the face of the returns. In the election contest trial before the Wyandotte county probate judge this week Senator Getty's attorneys asked the county clerk to bring the ballots into court and use them as evidence In the case. This the official refused to do and the probate Judge also refused to officially order him to do so. If Senator Getty cannot get a peremptory man damus he will try for an alternative mandamus against these two officials The court will pass on this matter this evening. Senator Getty's principal ob ject for this haste in getting the ballots counted In court is to secure all his evidence before the legislature convenes. The state senate will pass finally on this election contest. Senator Getty, In speaking today of this contest, said: "Some people may think that I have instituted these con test proceedings on the strength of having a Republican senate to pass final judgment on them. This is not ao. I will not take the seat unless It can first show gross errors and fraud In the count of the ballots as certified by the election canvassers.". In speaking of the irregularities that governed the Wyandotte election the senator declared that they bordered on the ridiculous. He referred to one case where he said the ballots from one pre cinct were turned over to a member of the Democratic committee and the latter took them over to Kansas City, Mo., with him and entered a saloon where he gave these ballots to a man he did not know. This committeeman in testifying in the election contest case this week, declared that the man he gave the package of ballots to went away with them and later returned and gave the package back to him. He thought it was the same package and unopened, but could not swear to the fact. In another case the election judges threw out ninety-live Republican bal lots for the reason that a cross had been marked in both the circle and the squares of one ticket. Still another case was where the election judges in considering fifteen Republican ballots thought they were all right, but pre ferred to check them ' up to the can vassing board to pass on and count and sent them in in a separate pack age. Of course the canvassing board could not count these ballots or any other, only certify up to the count of the election judges, and thev were not counted. When the Judges heard of this they appeared be fore the canvassing board and as f ed per mission to then count the fifteen ballots and add them to the total of the returns. They asked in vain. NEW TRIAL REFUSED. To Four Defendants in Pennsylvania Capitol Fraud Cases. Harrisburg, Pa., Dec. 11. A new trial was refused to four of the defendants in the capitol conspiracy cases today by Judge George Kunkel in the Dauphin I m,,4-'cr -,,, Viofn ra wilnh tha mn had Deen tried. The defendants are John H. Sanderson, contractor for the furnishing and decorations in the is, 000,000 capitol, James Shumacker, Johns town, who was superintendent of the board of public grounds and buildings; William P. Snyder, former auditor gen eral of the state and William L. Math ues, former state treasurer. These men with Joseph M. Huston. Philadelphia, the architect of the great building were charged with Conspiracy to cheat and defraud the state in connection with furnishing and decorating the capitol, but Huston secured a severance and his trial has not yet come up. The four defendants were tried last spring and were convicted. They ap pealed for a new trial but argument was not heard until after the court had disposed of a second conspiracy trial, in which the defendants in the first case were also among the accused and were acquitted. Several other defend ants of whom there were 14 in all, re main to be tried. One defendant died and another was removed to a sani tarium having broken down mentally during his trial. The capitol scandal is one of the out comes of the political revolution in Philadelphia in 1905, following which a Democratic state treasurer was elected. He discovered and made public alleged irregularities and the prosecutions fol lowed. In all, reasons for a new trial were filed for Sanderson and more than 50 each for the others. Most of the reasons charged errors by the court. The defendants will appear for sentence next Friday when appeals to the state supreme court will be taken. Cairo Cafe Burned. New York, Dec. 11. The Cairo, one of the widest known of the cafes of the old tenderloin district, was destroyed by fire early today with a loss of $10, 000. Several firemen had a narrow es cape from injury when a metal ceil ing over the restaurant on the main floor fell. The cafe was located on West Twenty-ninth street. Gets Husband to Fool Jakers. Learning that her friends, as a joke, had planned a "tin shower" upon her, Miss Mary Gladstone, a spinster of South Norwalk, Conn., stole a march on the jokers by scurrying around and getting a husband whom she presented to her friends, to their complete con sternation. The man upon whom Miss Gladstone exercised her leap year privi leges was William Green, of Stamford. New York World- MY BE A FIGHT. Dutch Battleship and Cruiser Cleared for Action. Sail From Willemstad for Coast of Yenezuela. TO ENFORCE BLOCKADE Probably Will Begin Seizure of Merchant Vessels. Castro's Government Threatened to Shoot. Has Willemstad, Curacoa, Dec. 11. The government of The Netherlands has no intentions of being negligent In the matter of the blockade of the Vene- zuelan coast inaugurated by three of Its warships last week. The battleship Jacob Van Heemskerk and the cruiser Gelderland left here this morning for Venezuelan waters. They have been cleared for action. - It Is believed that the warships will make a demonstration off LaGualra. Furthermore, they probably will begin slzlnB Venezuelan merchant vessels, thus putting a stop to the trade be tween Venezuelan ports. A clash between the Warships and the coastal forts of Venezuela Is liable to follow any radical action, because the government at Caracas has ex pressed its intention of-nrinig on the Dutcn ships at the first "unfriendly act. GUARANTEE EARNINGS. F. Yoakum Has a Solution of the Railway Problem. Chicago, Dec. 11. B. F. Yoakum of the Rook Island-Frisco lines, who spoke Wednesday night before the Chicago Association of Commerce on "Our Country and Railroads" yester day supplemented his remarks by a statement that "unless- the-national and state governments will pursue a sufficiently liberal policy with respect to tne railroads to enable them to se cure earnings which will warrant them in developing the country, there is only one other solution of the- trans portation problem. That solution is for the government to guarantee a certain percentage of return on capi tal invested in railway ventures." Mr. Yoakum, however, did not wish to bo understood as favoring such a guarantee by the government, and he expressed the belief that the policy of both the nation and of the states will be more llberal'.when the questions Involved are-; better understood. Ex plaining bis alternatives- Mr. Yoakum said: "The people of this country- should remember that during the last fifty years the railroads have Increased their mileage by two hundred thou sand miles, and at an expenditure of private capital amounting to approxi mately 13 billion. We all agree that the country west of Chicago will need at least 100,000 additional miles of railroad, probably 200,000 miles, to fully develop it. You know there are regions which have great possibilities for development which are nearly 100 miles from transportation. Mr. Yoakum said he thought it could be truthfully said that the earnings of the main western roads are again at normal. "Some railway heads," he declared, "believe that the normal earning con dition in the west is only temporary. I believe it is here to stay." WEATHER CONTINUES PLEASANT. Slightly Colder But Sun StlU Shines Brightly. Although the temperatures today have been somewhat lower than those of Thursday the conditions for Christmas shopping remain ideal, though the word does seem fagged from overuse. Many of the merchants feel that If a drop in the mercury should occur it might stimulate trade, though the stores and shops are crowded under the present conditions. As far as Weatherman Jennings can see, even with the use of his "far away" glasses everything is serene and not a threatening sign is in sight. In sup port of this observation he has issued a forecast which reads: "Fair and warmer tonight and Saturday," all of which is highly satisfactory. The fol lowing were the temperatures since 7 o'clock this morning: 7 o'clock 29 8 o'clock 29 9 o'clock 29 10 o'clock 31 11 o'clock 34 12 o'clock 3$, j. u (j iul tv ........ oo ( 2 o'clock 39 

STATE OWES LITTLE. Bonded Debt Is Now Only Six Hundred and Five Thousand Dollars. State Treasurer Mark Tulley has made a payment of $18,000 on the state's, bonded indebtedness. This leaves a balance of $605,000 that Kansas owes in the form of outstanding bonds and $85,000 of this sum will fall due July 1. 1909. Treasurer Tulley said today that the state would have the money at tnat time to iiihhk prumpi pay ment of the sum. Kansas is in better shape than any of the western states in the matter of her bonded debt. In fact, there are few states In the union that have so small a bonded debt at this time as has Kansas. "Under the present valuation of the stat" said Mr. Tulley, "a levy of 3 cents on the J100 would pay off every cent of the state's bonded Indebtedness, or a levy of one-third of a mill on the dollar would be sufficient to liquidate." Young Man Shoots Rival. Galena, Kan., Dec. 11. Fred Cavener, a youth of 19, fired three shots from a revolver at Phrow Stoney late Thurs day, also a boy of 19. Cavener called at the home of his 16-year-old sweet heart, Mrs. Villa Vincent, divorced, and found Stoney there. One shot took ef fect in Stoney's back. He will recov er. Cavener was arrested. Stoney is a cousin of the woman and was a rival for her affections. Weather Indications. Chicago, Dec. 11. Forecast for Kansas: Fair and warmer tonight and Saturday. 

STUBBSJS JOLLY. Governor Elect Having a Good Time in Washington. Says Roosevelt's Greatest Act Is Conservation of Resources. IMPROVE WATERWAYS Believes That Is Greatest Prob lem Before People. Says Cannon Belongs to Crowd of Century Ago. Washington, Dec. 10. "One of the greatest acts President Roosevelt ever performed in his political career, one which generations to come will appre elate and understand much deeper and better than we of today do, is the creation of the national conservation idea," said Roscoe W. Stubbs, governor-elect of Kansas, who is here at tending the conservation congress and waterways convention. Mr. Stubbs declared that President Roosevelt, bringing together the state executives with the national govern ment, and affording opportunities for both of these authorities to co-operate in a cause ' which will benefit the whole country, rendered the country an everlasting service. A harmonious and systematized effort to conserve the national re sources of the country, and to pre vent, or at least reduce the tre mendous waste in every field, was made possible by the course Mr. Roosevelt took in the matter; in dependent action on the part of each state executive would have been crowned with some success in their own communities, but it could never have been as thorough and success ful as the present system, inaugurated by the president. "The greatest problem now con fronting the country is the movement toward improving the waterways. This, in my opinion, is by far the most important thing of interest to the people. It is more important than tariff revision or anything else now occupying the public mind. With the improvement of the Mis souri and Mississippi rivers freight rates would be reduced from one fourth to one-sixth. And reduced freight rates would mean much to the great grain producing state of Kansas. it would cheapen the price of lum per, steel and other building ma teriais, as well as , many other products largely consumed hv nnr state." it was pointed out to Mr. Stnhh that Uncle Joe Cannon, who controls tne "purse strings" of the treasurv. was unalterably opposed to any plan of improving the waterways of the country on account of the tremendous expenses involved. Oh, Cannon is a fine old fellow. personally; a wonderful man in many respects, but he belongs to the crowd of a century ago," said Mr. Stubbs. 'What the house of representatives needs is a new speaker, a. vonntr man with ideas of present day needs. We don't want to stand still as a nation, but we want to move right ahead and keep up with public demand." Mr. Stubbs Is accompanied by Mrs. Stubbs, and their two sons, Paul and j.u.i.c, j.. xney are stopping at the Raleigh hotel and will remain no through the week. Mr. Stubbs said it was his intention to pav his respects to President Roosevelt before leaving the city. The chances are he will go to the White House alone, as he is well acquainted with the president. In the meanwhile Mr. Ktnhh ia rat ting in the time at conventions and hobnobbing with the Jfnt. gation and Kansas people eenerallv Incidentally, he will find t; doubt, to look into the Knat,s 'o view the proceedings of that august ooay witn more than special interest. nousana in Washington ex pect to see you come to the United States senate in the near future." was the substance of a query put as a "Je,r" ?,f Mr- Stubbs ambition. thnTXfhV :?

I pro- S?fehP-Biv2 PeoRle ' Kansas one of the best administrations they ever had That means my very best efforts." Few old-time printers who have attain ed prominence ever began to learn the trade at as tender an age as did Victor Murdock, the gentleman from Kansas who has been called "one of the smartest of the Sunflower state." He was ten when, during school vacation, he began tr get the smell of printer's ink - in his nnstrilw while pluanlni, nWnHnn ers, type forms, etc. Less than five years ici uu w ao a iuu neoed printer on his father's paner. and incidentally- ihaiH of a strike against the mandates of his parent. Naturally, the father was wroth and took the youngster to task, where upon, according to tradition, the child made reply: "Father, you think you are a big man now, but the time is coming when you will be chiefly known as Victor Murdock's father." The father, at that time, was owner and editor of the Wichiat Eagle, and exerted a wide influence. But today Victor Mur dock's name is heard in Kansas where his father's is not known. Victor's entire career has been some what akin to that of the cyclones for which his state used to be famous. He was a newspaper reporter at fifteen. At nine teen he married a girl four years his junior, and because h'a father would not advance his pay from $8 to J15 a week, the youngster pulled out for Chicago, made good as a reporter, returned to Kansas as his father's managing editor, and nine year later, when thirty-two, found him self a duly accredited congressman from Kansas. It was Victor Murdock, the reporter, who made "Sockless" Jerry Simpson na tionally famous, fictitiously holding in an article written for his father's paper that that Populist candidate for congress did not clothe his feet as other men did. In a way, this has remained Murdock's most briiliant bit of work: and it had a whole lot to do with making Jerry Simpson a congressman, his followers taking up the epithet applied to him In a spirit of levity and making a telling campaign slogan out of it. . The following bills and petitions were presented to the house by Congressman C. K. Scott: Bills erantlng increased pen sions to Michael Stagg, George L .McCal lum. Benamin F. Oreen. John W .Harris, Samuel Palmer. William A. Drew, Flovd Cornwell, Amanda Blake. David Dettj. Clara J.

Hutcheson and Henry H. Klock. - Isaac G. Law has been appointed post master at Milton, Sumner county, Kan., to succeed A. W. Lynn, resigned. 

TAFT IS HOPEFUL. He Expects a Genuine and Thorough Revision of the Tariff. Washington, Dec' XL William H.- Taft said here that it was his belief that the house would make an "honest and thor ough revision nf the tariff" at the extra session which' he will call for that pur pose. This belief he bases on a confer ence he had with Speaker Cannon and a session, with the Republican members of the ways and means committee. Mr. Taft said he had not as vet con sulted with senators on the subject In dicating the tremendous " pressure upon his time as the-reason. -When the sug gestion was made that the senate would undoubtedly have something to do with the tariff bill, he replied, with no uncer tainty in his demeanor, that there was some one else who also would have some thing to do with the bill which, inter preted through the medium of previous utterances, indicates clearly that Mr. Taft is determined even to the exercise of veto power to prosecute the party pledges. ivir. tart dictated a statement wnien covered his interview with the Republican memDers or tne committee witn the ex ception of Representatives McCall of Massachusetts and Crumnacker of In diana. With the latter Mr. Taft had a satisfactory interview at Hot Springs. He was asked the substance of the interview he had with the speaker. His reply was that Mr. Cannon had said that he was in favor of an honest and thorough revision of the tariff In accord with the party promises. The question of the speaker ship of the next congress, Mr. Taft said, was not discussed but many other matters of legislation were. He added that he had been somewhat misled regarding his in terpretation of the attitude of the speak er by reports of Mr. Cannon's speech be fore the Cleveland chamber of commerce. The official report of that speech, he said, had given him an entirely different im pression. "I had an Interview with Mr. Cannon." said Mr. Taft, "and with his concurrence, and, at the suggestion of a member of the wars and means committee with the Re publican members of that committee. From my conversation with them and the discussion wnicn ionowea as to the ex amination which they are now conducting and expect to conduct, I have every rea son to be confident that they are keenly alive to the obligation which is on them as representatives elected to represent the itepuDiican party, to prepare an nonest and thorough revision of the present tariff, that thev have three times as much evidence, as has ever been taken In the preparation of other tariffs, and that they are going to- make additional effort and independent effort to get at the evidence themselves by the use of subpoenas and under oath, with a view to reaching the difference in The cost of production of the various articles brought within the tariff here and abroad. "I found them quite anxious for as much harmony as possiDie in wnicn i sympathize with them and prepared for consultation on points ot outicuity mat might, arise in the future. The plan Is to prepare a bill on such evidence as they have and will have in the course of the hearings and then to call additional evi dence as to Items whenever it should seem necessary.. Not only from conver sation with the members together but with the members individually, I am quite convinced they are in good faith .going to prepare a mil wnicn snail De a tnor ough revision on the basis of the platform or tne nepuuncan party. "The discussion covered other things, like the Philippine tariff and I am very hopeful that there win De no anncuity in reaehine- ar agreement between the var ious people interested, those representing the Philippine island and those represent ing the sugar and the tobacco Interest so that there will be no dispute and that the matter may be incorporated in the new tarltr Din witnout an issue. 

PLEDGE SUPPORT. More Than 30 Governors Join Hand on Conservation Programme. Washington. Dec. 11. Prophetic of far reaching results growing out of the joint conservation conference Is a report draft ed today by more than 30 governors, ap proving the principle of co-operation in the conservation of the country's natural resources and emphasizing the impor tance of such co-operation to the end that the prosperity and perpetuity of the na tion may be assured. The last day's conference was of much significance but in pledging their support to every pnase or tne conservation proD lem, the governors furnished the climax to one of the most eventful gatherings ever held in this country. The conference approved the disposal cf mineral rights by lease only and the dis posal or timber rignts only under condi tions insuring proper cutting and logging. The policies on which particular em phSsis is laid were: "That all uses of the waters and all portions of each waterway shall be treat ed as interrelated: legislation for the de velopment of waterways for navigation, water supply, and other interstate uses, preferably bv federal appropriation, oth erwise, bv issue of bonds: more scientific research as to the extent of the nation's resources; the maintenance of a national conservation commission empowered to co-operate with state commissioners." SHOT SEVEN NEGROES. He Had to Stop When His Revolver Was Empty. Memphis, Tenn., Dec. 11. "I shot 'era and that's all there's to it." Beyond this, mumbled as he was being led to a cell at police headquarters, Wm. Latura, a white man of this cltv, proffered no explanation of the killing of three negroes and the wounding of four others at a saloon here early today. According to the statement of bystand ers, when Latura entered the saloon, a group of negroes were about a pool table In the rear room, engaged in a game. As he walked into the room, it is declared, Latura, after surveying the crowd, leis urely unbuttoned a long overcoat he wore and drew an automatic pistol. If any words were passed those who escaped the rain of bullets which followed by dodging behind the furniture, declare they heard none. As Latura shot one after another of the negroes fell. When the police ar rived, three were dead and four others were lying about the floor wounded, one of the latter a woman, tiis weapon empty.
