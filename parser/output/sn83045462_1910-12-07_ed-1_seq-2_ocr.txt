'In conclusion, allow me, gentlemen, to express my earnest wishes for the happy outcome of your labors, that will doubtless contribute to the increased greatness of this country*, which is an example of what intelligence and labor may achieve when used in the cause of progress." Popular Sentiment Created. Representative Alexander of New York, chairman of the House committee on rivers and harbors, congratulated the congress upon Its efficient work in arousing a healthier and more general public sentiment in behalf of waterway improvement. "There was a time," said he,, "when those upon whom fell the labor and responsibility of recommending appropriations felt that only those were interested in the work who directly and immediately profited by the expenditure of the money. It could readily be recalled that when river and harbor bills were introduced one or more members of the House challenged their need, enlarged upon their wastefulness and assailed individual appropriations, especially those devoted to projects for the improvement of the great inland rivers. But the intelligent efforts of this body, representative of every lo?w*? tVtn ttrnnor anil 1^1111/ auu UV f v* ivu %v mv W|#v? prompt Improvement of the more important waterways, have been helpful to legislation by creating a sentiment which makes for the betterment of water transportation routes. "The readiness of the Rivers and Harbors Congress to seize upon the accomplishment of the end In view has best been demonstrated, perhaps, in the early espousal of an annual river and harbor bill. The experience of business men quietly called for business methods, and the elimination of the uncertainties of legislation became a rallying cry. The efficiency of an annual river and harbor hill has been demonstrated by sixteen years' experience. It meant certainty of appropriations, it satisfied the Corps of engineers, it safeguarded the early completion of projects, and it combined economy with the best business methods. Hostility to river and harbor improvements drove it from legislation fields. But now that such hostility is eliffilnated no ?">od reason exists why it should not he restored. To Restore Annual Jill. "An earnest effort to do so will be tnadc at this session of Congress. The engineers have opened the way by submitting minimum estimates for a single year, arid If the policy of the rivers and harbors committer is adopted a bill can he enacted Into law moderate In amount, fair to all sections of the country, dis. criminating in its selection of projects and helpful In the speedy completion of great Improvements. "The engineers' estimates, reducing the cost of maintenance to its lowest terms, has eliminated the fear often expressed that the maintenance of completed projects would of itself make river and harbor appropriations oppressive; but the figures submitted render such a fear groundless, since they show that 136 localities, Including all the great harbors of the country, with that of New York and its celebrated Ambrose channel, can he maintained for less than two millions and a quarter." Referring to the Ohio. Mississippi and Missouri j-ivers, Mr. Alexander expressed the opinion that as surely as trade follows the flag just so certainly w ill commerce follow and fill the permanently improved channels of these great inland waterways. Waterway Bills Defended. The most notable feature of the address by Representative Ransdell, president of the congress, was the statement that river and harbcr tills for the last thirteen years have been as free from the charge of "pork barrel" cs any measure passed hv Congress. "We have always opposed a dribbling, piecemeal policy of waterway improvement and have always insisted upen the adoption of a complete, general, wise and conservative plan. With the end in view of completion in a definite period?of ten to fifteen years?fhose waterways in our interior and along oar seacoasts give ,-romise of increasing and cheapening transportation facilities "We have ever made and shall continue to mak?* a determined tight against anyttiintr that savors of so-called 'pork barrel* legislation in river and harbor bills, and we unhesitatingly say that for the last thirteen years these bills have been as free from the charge of pork barrel as any that have l?een passed by Congress. While there has been criticism of this character, in our judgment it is unwarranted by the facts." Mr. Ransdell, just before adjournment at 12:.">0 o'clock, announced the rules which will govern the convention. Announcements were made of committee assignments and recess was taken until i:ir? o'clock. This Afternoon's Session.

SEES PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION Opposed to Reduction of Teachers' Salaries?Senator Dillingham Re- 1 i luctant to Agitate Changes in j Administration. ( < The appointment of a commission to determine what should be .done in the way of negotiations and of legislation looking to the addition to the District | of Columbia of the palisades of the Po- 1 tomac and federal reservations across , the river in Virginia was suggested this , morning by Senator Gallinger. chairman , of the Senate District committee. I He was discussing the first steps neees- , sary to carry out one of the recommen- j dations made by President Taft in yes- , terday's message to Congress. . The President and Senator Gallinger are close together in their view on re- , trocession. Senator Gallinger has recent- ( ly expressed himself as believing that ( opposition to the reclaiming to the Dis- , trict of Columbia of all the territory in , Virginia formerly included in the "ten miles square" was great enough to de- j feat any efforts along that line. Would Preserve Palisades. But he doesn't like to see the beauty i of the palisades of the Potomac opposite ] the National Capital marred, and sug- ] gests that a good way to preserve them , as an ornament to the Federal Capital Is < to place them within the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia and therefore i under the direct supervision of Congress. < "I hape we can do that some time," j aalH this mnrnln? Senator Galllnger. however, thinks that some negotiations will be necessary with the commonwealth of Virginia, and that the exact legal status of the whole question must necessarily be determined before definite stepe can be taken. It is for that purpose that Senator Galllnger has suggested the appointment of a commission. "Some man or body of men could be appointed by the Commissioners to make an investigatibn and outline the necessary legislative action to be taken," he said. "Some who are familiar with "the past relations between the District of Columbia and Alexandria county could be designated. The Congress would have some definite plan of action placed before it." Attention will probably be given to this question at one of the early meetings of the Senate District committee. There is a possibility of action to that extent at the present short session. Knows of No School Graft. Senator Galllnger said today that he ha%read with much interest all the President's recommendations affecting the District government. "I am not persuaded that there has been extravagance In the expenditures for the District's public schools. I have heard absolutely nothing to indicate that . there is what is commonly termed graft in the local schools," he said, in commenting on the President's statements regarding the educational system. "I do not think," the President said in his message, "the present control of the school system of Washington commends itself as the most efficient and economical ana morougn lusu uiueui. ior i?o c?rj* ins on of public Instruction." He then set forth a table, prepared by Engineer Commissioner Judson, showing that the cost of the schools per capita per annum in the District Is higher than in other cities of about the same sise. "If the facts are to be obtained as to the reasons for the cost of maintenance here." Senator Gallinger said today. "I thing special inquiry should be made along three lines. High Cost May Be Explained. "It should be determined whether or not the enforcement of the eight-hour law in the District, and not in some other cities with which I am familiar, adds to the cost of school buildings here. There is also the question whether or not the double system of schools?one for white and one for colored pupils?makes the cost of maintenance -^higher here than elsewhere. "Borne claims have been made that there is a superabundance of supervision in the local system. That suggests a third line of inquiry. "I do not look for any school legislation at this short session. Of course, if it ran -be shown that money can be saved without cutting down the salaries of teachers?to which I am opposed?and without sacrificing the valuable features of school buildings, such as making them fireproof and otherwise safe for the health and lives of the pupite, something might be done." It id expected that some consideration will be given by the District committee to the adoption of a comprehensive financial plan for the District. President Taft recommended the adoption of what is known as the Judson plan, under which permanent improvements will be financed out of th? current revenues by extending the time within which the debt can be paid. That plan is before the Senate District committee in the shape of a bill. Dillingham Reluetant to Change. Senator Dillingham, ranking member of the Senate District committee, said today that other duties. Including: those as chairman of the immigration commission, which is sending a forty-volume report to the government printing office lust now, had prevented him from giving special consideration to the President's recommendations for District legislation. "Without intending and criticism of the President or of the local schools," lie said this morning, "I do think that when a system is working in a generally satisfactory way there should not be agitation for a change without a thorough investigation and specific reasond."

BEFORE SENATE COMMITTEE Investigation in Chicago of Alleged Corruption in Senatorial Election. Instead of going to St. Louis July 13, 1900, to distribute among Illinois legislators the famous alleged "jackpot" fund, Robert E. Wilson, member of the legislature of Illinois, testified today before the Senate subcommittee investigating the election of Senator William Lorimer that the purpose of his visit was to arrange for a banquet for Lee O'Neill Brown, one of the leaders of the democratic minority. Counsel Enters Protest. Wilson's examination was conducted t?y Attorney A. S. Austrian, representing the Chicago Tribune. Once Judge Eldridge Hanecy, counsel for Senator Lorimer, protested against Austrian questioning Wilson about his testimony before the grand jury in Chicago. Judge Hanecy said an indictment was pending n Illinois against Wilson, and he protested against what seemed to be a 'persecution, malicious in its nature." Before the trip which Wilson made to St. Louis was touched upon the witness ?xplained that the reason that he, a democratic member of the legislature, voted for Lorimer, a republican, for senator was because former Sheriff Barrett had iclrort him nn hiq HnafhhnH (a i^a unvfhfnir vw O lie ever could for Mr. Lorlmer. Was Planning for Banquet. Wilson said he went to St. Louis to arrange for the banquet, because the opposing faction had given a dinner to its leader. The members who met him there were Beckemeyer, Luke, Shepard, Link, Clark and White. The examination into what took place it St. Louis was not extended, on account af the committee taking a recess. Wilson, however, denied that he paid money to any of the legislators. He failed to recall that White had been in the bathroom of his room at the hotel with him. it had been charged that Wilson, while they were in the bathroom, turned the "jackpot" over to White for distribution among members of the legislature. Wilson did recall that he invited Shepard into the bathroom, but he could not remember their conversation, further than to say that it was not material. IBMHUIYMEED ? HUSTON'S COUNSB. . Indictment at Variance With Evidence, Is Claim?Method of Use of Mails. That the proof offered by the prosecution is at variance with the allegation of the indictment against James X. Huston, former treasurer of the United States; Harvey M. Lewis and Everett Dufour, on trial in Criminal Court, Xo. 1, before Justice Wright and a Jury, charging them with conspiracy to use the malls to defraud. was the claim made today by Attorney Henry E. Davis for the defense. Therefore he asked the court to instruct the jury to acquit the defendants. Argument on the question was reserved at request of United States Attorney Wilson, who informed the court that he was taken wholly by surprise, and persuaded the court (o let the argument await until the requests for instructions to the Jury had been decided? The entire seBSlon of Criminal Court No. 1 tomorrow will be occupied in the arguments of counsel. It is expected the case will go to the jury Friday morning. Technical Point Raised. The variance urged by Attorney Davis is that while the indictment alleges the overt acts of the conspiracy to have been committed by depositing letters in the "Washington post office, the evidence introduced before the jury shows that instead of being deposited in the post office part of the letters were dropped into a chute in an office building which had not been designated by the Postmaster General as a depository for mail and that the other letters had been put Into a letter box on F street. Mr. .Davis contended there Is no evidence in the case to show the letters were ever collected from either the chute or the mall box, and. If they were so collected, no scintilla of evidence was offered to prove they ever reached the Washington post office. "We do not know," said Attorney Davis, "whether, If they had been collected, they would have been taken to the post office or direct to the mall trains. The record Is absolutely silent on this point." Witnesses Heard Yesterday. After The Star's report closed yesterday, Frank B. Kaye testified on behalf of Dufoour, corroborating thA defendant's testimony that White and Tierce were in the office of Dufour In this city. On cross-examination by Assisyuit United States Attorney Turner, the witness was unable to state the exact time when he said White was here, or the subject of the conversation of White. He also could not recollect any other person whom he saw in the office at that time. Joseph W. Bauby also testified as to seeing White in Dufour's office. He said he was Introduced by Dufour to White as his future employer. ENEMIES SEEK REVENGE. Dynamite Exploded in Garage of Italian Consul at Seattle.

Smith had occupied a number of pulpits in Washington for various pastors. Last Sunday, on the Invitation of Rev. G. Ellis Williams, pastor, he delivered the sermon in the Lincoln Avenue Methodist Church. Several weeks ago he spoke in Charles' Town, W. Va., before a large meeting held in the interest of a new Y. M. C. A. building for that city. So well pleased were the association workers in that city with his appeal for the work that 5,000 copies of the address were printed and sent to all who were interested in the effort, as well as those who might possibly be induced to evince interest. Gratified With Reception. After his return to Washington Dr. Smith told a number of his friends that he was especially pleased to be able to aid the work in West Virginia. The cordiality with which his appeal was received and the subsequent response on the part of leading residents to the work, he averred, were especially gratifying to him.

That the Commissioners are gratified by the length of the President's remarks j regarding the District in his annual message may be gathered by the happiness with which they discuss the subject None of them doubts that President Taft has given more attention to the needs of the District in the message of yesterday than has any other chief executive, and they are therefore under the belief that when the entire nation realises that the National Capital is the subject of so much consideration the 00,000,000 Americans will have more and more of the feeling that Washington is "our city." "I can say nothing that expresses my ideas more clearly and more forcibly o? the subject of the District in the message than was expressed by the editorial ir The Star of yesterday," said Commissioner Johnston today, "and I am glad to see that both the press and the peopl< are taking up the same strain. It must be of intense gratification to the President to see that in paying so much attention tc Washington he is getting the co-operation of every serious-minded person in It. Audience of ifinety Millions. "There is one thing that I am particularly impressed with, and that is the fae that the President has an audience 01 90,000,000 people. He fes the one man whc can appeal to all the people, and in tak lng up so much of his message witl Washington affairs he is certainly bounl to create a great sentiment that Washington is the 'national city.' "We are to be congratulated, I think, as much for that reason 8s for anythlnfl else." Commissioner Rudolph is especially interested In the portion of the message recommending that the public schools lx put back under the supervision of tin board of Commissioners, .lie said that n< other city would, in his opinion, tolerate a board of education separate and distinct from the municipal heads. "I do not believe," he said, "that any other President has ever taken up District affairs the way President Taft ha? done. The insight he has into the city's business is of great importance, and is a compliment to the whole District. I am particularly glad to note that he has recommended that the board of Commissioners be clothed with the powers of a public service corporation. This we have already asked Congress to do, and I take it as a compliment that the President should urge Congress to take favorable action on the bill already drawn up."

Sanchez-Azcona was a powerful 1 man in Mexico and a powerful enemy even for Diaz. His paper there, which Diaz suppressed three times and Anally 1 confiscated altogether, was not only the most up-to-date newspaper in the City of 1 Mexico, but was a strong weapon for the 1 anti-Diaz sympathizers.

" I Says He Was Only a Witness. i Azcona declared last night that the ' incident in connection with which charges have been preferred against j him occurred four years ago, and that his part in the affair was merely as a ; witness. He asserted that while employed as manager of El Diario, a newspaper in Mexico City, contributions were received by that paper for the entertainment of the poor of the Mexican capital. The funds were insufficient, how1 ever, Azcona alleged, and were turne.! . over to a committee of prominent women of Mexico City for disburse; ment among the poor. Another newspaper, of opposite political preference, , he said, charged that the money had been diverted from the original purpose of the donors. Azcona declared that after due judi1 cial investigation, in which he appeared as a witness, the case was dropped.

The conference, for that is what it 1 eally was, as no new business of any 1 lort was discussed, was called by Chairnan Smith, in order that the members 1 night talk over ways and means of securing action at this session on the thirty- ' ight local measures now on the calendar 1 ind which it is desired to get out of the ' vay before adjournment. Decided opposition developed at the neeting of the committee today toward iny program involving the reporting of lew legislation unless definite assurances :an be obtained from the organization eaders in the House that the paucity of egular District days will be supplemented by special days, set aside solely for lie consideration of local business, or by evening sesions devoted to the same purpose. The principal objection to evening sessions seems to lie in the fact that the >pponents of any measure that might lie scheduled for consideration would be sure to show up, while it is not by any means so certain that the friends of those measures, at least thoBe that could be counted passively In the affirmative, would do so. Only Four Begular Days. Representative Samuel XT. Smith of Michigan, the committee chairman, pointed out to his colleagues that there is strong probability that there will be only four regular district days at this session. This, at a glance, Is a convincing argument for special days or evening sessions, he said, for consideration o? District legislation alone. There are eleven bills on the House calendar, nineteen on the union calendar, four on the private calendar and four reported to be tabled. The bills on the House calendar include the Pearre loanshark bill, the Coudrey gas company bond issue resolution, the Nye personal property assessment bill, the Olcott measure creating a national board of sanitary inspectors, the Pearre measure for the compulsory support of illegitimate chiliren and the Cary bill to reduce the price of gas to the consumer. On the union calendar there are the Olonft hill for thp retirement of suner animated school teachers on pension, a measure of great interest locally: the Smith bill, embodying the provisions of the Judson funding plan for District Inances; the Pearre inheritance tax bill and numerous street extension bills affecting all quarters of the city. Another effort will be made in the near future by Chairman Smith to secure a special District day at an early late. He tried to get unanimous consent for this purpose yesterday, but failed through the objections raised by Representatives Tawney of Minnesota and Mann of Illinois. President's Massage Pleases. Mr. Smith told a Star reporter this morning that he was exceedingly pleased with that portion of the Presllent's message dealing with the District of Columbia. He has long been enthusiastically in favor of a public service commission; in fact, he was an advocate of this proposition before it had become generally discussed, and - -" nf tlm oeueves intii iuc uiuutuva.v*v?? w?. original plan to secure the recession by Virginia of its original contribution of land for the District of Columbia can be worked out without undue difficulty. "ij?st year, if you will remember," said Mr. Smith, in talking over the District portion of the President's message today, "I introduced two bills affecting the public utilities of the District. One of these bills proposed to clothe the District Commissioners with the powers of a public service commission; the other proposed to create a separate commission of three members for the purpose. The enactment of either one of these bills into law would have accomplished the desired result. But I am inclined to agree with President Taft that there is need of centralization. with its ensuing economy, In the District of Columbia, and that consequently It would be better on both counts to confer on the Commissioners, by the necessary legislation, the power to make rules and regulations governing the conduct of the gas. electric light and power and street car companies of the National CapitalExpects Early Action. "So far as the acquirement by the District of a small amount of land on the Virginia side of the Potomac, so that the park system of the District may be planned in its entirety and carried out logically and comprehensively, I do not think any serious objections will be raised, such as marked the proposal to acquire the entire original tract ceded by Virginia, and I would not be surprised to see some action on this proposition within the next three months. "I think that eventually we will have x director of education at the head of the public school system of the District. I think, however, it is an open question as to whether the people of the District ire in favor at this time of abolishing the board of education and centralizing ill the school authority in a single head. This is a question which the average person interested in the subject desires plenty of time to consider." In view of the pressure being brought to bear upon the District committee and upon Congress, just now, for the early enactment of the Olcott school teacuers" retirement bill, in order to secure :avqiable cons.deration of the measure it is probable that it will be necessary for the sponsors of the proposition to accept an amendment providing for the withdrawal of all aid by the federal government, making the pension pldn entirely contributory. So much opposition to the measure is threatened, unless tins amendment is accepted, that it is considered extremely doubtful if favorable ^nnlH h? hnrl nnnn It In tha Hmisp even after extended consideration.

The rivers and harbors appropriation bill, on which the House committee on rivers and harbors has been working for a fortnight, will be put in final shape at a meeting, which probably will be held tomorrow. The bill, carrying approximately $22,000,000 of c&sli funds and $5,000,000 in continuing contracts, in addition to $7,500,000 likely to be included.in the sundry civil appropriation bill, when that measure is framed by the appropriations committpe, probably will be reported to the House Friday.
