THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. f Continued from First Page.'] mercial .predominance of Great Britain on all these coasts and seas. A greater slime in this trade is no'.v the desire and intent of our people. It is also manifest that the efforts of other European nations to contend with Gieat Britian for a share of this commerce has been successful in proportion with their adoption of regular steam postal communication with the markets whose trade they sought. Mexi co and the states of South America are anx ious to receive such postal communications with this country and aid in the development of a similar cooperative may be looked for in due time from eastern nations and from Aus trailia. It is difficult to see how the lead in this movement can be expected from private interests. In respect to foreign commerce, quite as much as in internal trade, postal communication seems a necessary matter to command public attention and thus pertain ing to the government. I respectfully recom mend to your prompt at: ention, such just and efficient measures as may conduce to the de velopment of our foreign commercial exchang es and building of our carrying trade. In this connection 1 desire also to suggest a very great service which might be expected in enlarging and facilitating our commerce on the Pacincocean were a t ransmarine cable laid from San Francisco to the Sandwich Islands and thence to Japan at the north and Aus trailia at the south. The great influence of such means of communication in these routes of navigation in developing and securing a due share of our Pacific coast inter-commerce of the world, needs no illustration or inforce ment. It may be that such enterprises are useful, and, in the end, as profitable as it would prove to private investment. It may need be accelerated by prudent legislation by congress in its aid and 1 submit the matter to your careful consideration. In additional and not unimportant, although a secondary reason for fostering and enlarging our navy, it may be found an unquestionable service to the expansion of our commerce which would be rendered by the frequent circulation of our naval ships in the seas and ports of all the 1 globe. Ships of proper construction and eqnipmeut would prove to be of the greatest efficiency in the case of maritime war, and f might be made constant and active agents in i; time of peace in the advancement and pro tection of our foreign trade and in the nur turc aud discipline of young stamen, who would, naturally, in some number, mix with and improve the cream of our merchant ships. Our merchants at home and abroad, recog nize the value to foreign commerce of active movements of our naval vessels and intelli gence and patriotic zeal of our naval officers in promoting every interest of their couutry men is a just subject for national pride. FINANCIAL MATTERS. The condition of the financial affairs of the government, as shown by the report of the secretary of the treasury, is very satisfactory. It is believed, at present, that the financial situation of the puffed States, whether eou sidered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth, or the extent and variety of our resources, is more favorable than that of any other country of our time and never lias been surpassed by that of any country at any period in the history of all our industries. Our authorized rate of interest is low, new railroads are being constructed, vast immigia tion is increasing our population, capital, la bor, new enterprises in great number are in progress aud our commercial relations with progress other countries arc improving. The ordinary revenues, from ail sourees, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, were (cents being omit ted) from customs, $180,502.064 ; from iutei .i nal revenue, $124,009,373 ; from sale of public lands, $10,116,506; from tax on the circula tion and deposits of national hanks, $7,014, 971 ; from repayment of interest by Pacific railway companies, $1,707,307 ; for sinking fund for Pacific railway companies, $796,021 : from customs, fees, lines, penalties, etc., $1, 148,800 ; from fees, letters of patent and lands, $2,337,092 ; from proceeds of sale of government property, $283,010 ; front profits of coinage, etc., $2,792,180; from revenues of the District of Columbia, $1,809, -if!»; from miscellaneous sources, $4,099,003 ; total or dinary receipts, 8333,520,010. The ordinary expenses "or the same period were : For civ il expenses, $15,003,903 ; for foreign inter course, $1,211,490; for Indians, $5.945,457: for pensions, including $19,341,025 arrears of pensions, $50,777,174; for the military estab lishment, including river and harbor improve ments and arsenals, $38,110,910 ; for the nav al establishment, including vessels, machinery and improvements at navy yards, $13,530,984; for miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, light-houses and collecting the revenues, $34,535,091 ; for expenditures on account of the District of Columbia, $3, 272,884 ; for interest on the public debt, $95, 757,575; for premiums on bonds purchased, I $2,795,320; total ordinary expenditures, $207,042,957, leaving a surplus revenue of $05,883,053, which, with an amount drawn from the cash balance in the treasury of $8, 084,434, making $73,908,087, was applied to the redemption of bonds for the sinking fund; also $73,052,900 of fract ional currency;!$251,717 of the loan of 1858; $40&'of temporary loan; $100 of bounty land script; $25 of compound interest notes ; $16,500 of 7-30 notes of 1894 and $5,265 of one and two year notes ; $3,700 1 of old demand notes; total $73,078,087. The amount due sinking fund for this year was $37,931, 643» There was applied thereto BS • he sum of $73,904,017, being $35,972,793 in S excess of the actual requirements for the I year. The aggregate of revenues from all sources durii g the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, was $333,520.010. an increase over the I preceding year of $59,699,420. Receipts thus far of the current year, together with es timated receipts for remainder of the year amount to $350,000,000, which will be suffici ent to meet the estimated expenditures of the year and leave a surplus ot $90,000,000. It is fortunate that this large surplus of revenue oc curs at a period when it may be directly ap plied to the payment of the public debt soon |to be redeemable. No public duty lias been more constantly cherished in the United States than the paying of the nation's debt as rapidly as possible. The debt of the United States, less cash in (lie treasury and exclusive of accruing interest, attained its maximum of $2,750,441,571 iu August 1865 and lias since that time been reduced to $1,886,019,504 of principal of debt. $108,758,100 has been paid since March 1st, 1877. Effecting an an nual saving of interest of $0,107,593. The burden of interest lias also been diminished by the sale of bonds bearing a low rate of in terest and the application of the proceed* to tlie redemption of bonds bearing high rate. The annual saving thus gained since Mardi 1st, 1877, is $14,290,458. Within a short, period over six hundred millions five and six iper eent. bonds will become redeemable. iig presents a very favorable opportunity not only to furtlier reduce the participai of tlie debt but also reduce the rate of interest on that whidr will remain unpaid. I call the attention of congress to the views pounded on this subject by the secretary of ithe treasury in his annual report and recom mend prompt legislation to enable the treas ury department to complete refunding the idebt which is about to mature. Tlie contin uance of specie payments has not been inter rupted or endangered since the date of resumption. It has contributed great ly to the revival of business and our remarkable prosperity, tlie fears preceded and accompanied resumption i proved groundless. No considerable lOunt of United States notes hâve been pre nted for redemption, while very large sums of gold bullion, both domestic and imported, are taken to the mints and exchanged for coin or notes. The increase of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1st, 1879, is estimated at $227,399 428. There are still in existence, uncanceled, $346,081,016 of United .States legal tender notes. These notes were authorized for war measures, made nec essary by tlie exigencies of the conflict in which the United States was then engaged. The preservation of the nation's existence re quired, in the judgment of congress, the issue of legal tender paper money; that it served well the purpose for which it was created, is not questioned; Dut the employment of notes as paper money indefinitely after the accom plishment of the object for which thev were provided, was not contemplated by tlie fram ers of tlie law under which they were issued. These notes long since became like any oilier pecuniary obligation of the government—a délit to be paid, and when paid, to he cancel ed, as were evidences of indebtedness no longer existing. I therefore repeat what was said in my annual message of last year, that the retirement from circulation tlie U. S.notes with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to he taken in our progress towards a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty ot the government, aud the interest and security of the people. At the time ot the passage of the act now in force requiring the coinage of silver dollars, fixing their value and giving them a legal ten der character, it was believed by many sup porters of the measure that the silver dollar which it authorized would speedily become uuder the operation of the law, of equivalent value to the gold dollar. There were other supporters of the bill who,while they doubted as to the probability of this result, neverthe less were willing to give Hie proposed expert ment a fair trial, with the view to stop tlie coinage if experience should prove that the silver dollar authorized liy the bill should prove to be of less commercial value than tlie standard gold dollar. The coinage of the sil ver dollars, under the act referred to, began in March, 1878, and has been continued as re quired by tlie act, the aveiage rate per month to tlie present time being 2,270,492. The total amount coined prior to tlie first of November last was, 72,847,750; of Ibis amount., 47.0S4, 450 remain in the treasury, and only 25,703, 291 are in the hands of the people. Constant efforts have been made to keep this currency in circulation, and considerable expense has been necessarily incurred for this purpose, but its return to the treasury is prompt and more than contrary to the confident expecta tions of tlie friends of tlie measure at '.lie time of its adoption. The value of the silver dollar, containing 412^ grains of silver, has not increased during the year prior to the passage of the bill authorizing Us coinage, the uiarKet value of the silver which it contained was from 90 to 92 cents as compared with the standard gold dollar. During the last year the average market value ot the silver dollar lias been 8Sj cents. It is obvious that the legislation of the last congress in re gard to silver, so far as it was based on an anticipated rise in silver as a result, has failed to produce the etlect then predicted. The longer the lav,-remains in force requiring as it does the coinage of a nominal dollar which in reality is not a dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this country will be forced to accept a single metal as the sole le gal standard of value in circulation; and this standard must uot be of less value than it purports tobe worth in the recognized money of the world. The Constitution of the United States is on sound financial principles, and tlie best interests of all require that tlie coun try should have as its legal tender money both gold and silver coins of intrinsic value, as bullion is equivalent to that which, upon its face, it purports to possess. The Constitiu tion, iu express terms, recognizes both gold and silver as the only true legal tender money. To banish either of these metals from our currency is to narrow and limit the circulat ing medium of exchange to tlie disparage ment of important interests. The United Stares produces more silver Ilian any otliet country, and is directly interested in main taining it as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world, it will, iu my opinion, contribute to this result if congress will repeal so much of the exist ing legislation as requires the coinage of a silver dollar containing only 4121) grains of silver, and in its stead will authorize the s- c retary of the treasury to coin silver dollars of an equivalent proportionate value as bullion is to gold dollars. This will defraud no one, and will be in accordance with familiar prece dents. Congress, on several occasions, has altered the ratio of value between gold and silver in order to establish it more nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of value be tween the two metals. In financial legislation any measure in the direction of greater fidel ity in tlie discharge of pecuniary obligations has been found by experience to diminish tlie rates of interest which the debtors are re quired to pay, and an increase of the facility with which money can be obtained for any legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial history shows how suddenly money becomes abundant when public confidence in the ex act performance of moneyed obligations is established. WAIt 

DEPARTMENT. The secretary of war reports that the ex penditures of the war department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, was $39,924, '3. The appropriations lor this department for the current fiscal year amount to $41,993, 030. With respect to the army, the secretary in vites attention to the fact that its strength is limited by statute (section 1115 Revised Stat utes) to not more than 30,000 enlisted men; butthat proviso contained in tlie appropria tion bills have limited expenditures to tlie enlistment ot but 25,000. It is believed that the full legal strength is the least possible force at which the present organization can be maintained, having in view efficiency, dis cipline and economy, while the enlistment of this force would add somewhat to the appro priation for the pay ot the army. The saving made iu other respects would be more than equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficiency of the army would be largely in creased. The rapid extension of the railroad system west of the Mississippi river, and the great tide of settlers which has flowed in upon the new territories, impose on the military an entire change of policy. The maintenance of small posts along the wagon aud stage routes of travel is no longer necessary. Per manent quarters at points selected, of more substantial character than those heretofore constructed will be required uuder existing laws. Permanent buildings cannot be erected without the sanction of congress, and when the sales of military siies and buildings hare been authorized, the moneys received have reverted to the treasury, and could only be come available through new appropriations. It is recommended that provisions be made by the general of the army for the sale of such abandoned military posts and buildings as are found unnecessary, and for the appli cation of the proceeds to the construction of other posts. While many of the present posts are of but slight value for military purr poses, owing to the changed condition of tint country, their occupation is continued at great expense and great inconveniece because they afford the only available shelter for ih« troops. The absence of a large number of officers of line on active duty from llieir regiments is a serious detriment to tlie maintenance nf tlie service. Tbe constant demand for small de a a tachment*) e: upwled'liy a commissioned officer, and the various details of officers for necessary ser vit' away from their commands occasions a scarcity in the number required for company duties. With the view to lessening this drain to some extent, it is recommended that tlie law authorizing the detail of officers from the active list as professors of tactics and military science at certain colleges and universities be so amended as to provide that, ail such details be made from the retired list of the army. Attention is asked to the necessity of pro viding legislation for organizing, arming and disciplining the Active tnililia of the country, aud liberal appropriations are recommended in this behalf. The report of the adjutant general of the army and chief ordinance touching this sub ject fully sels forth its importance, and the report of the officer in charge of education in the army shows that there are seventy-eight schools now in operation in the army, with an aggregate attendance of 2305 enlisted men and children. The secretary recommends the enlistment of 150 schoolmasters, with the rank and pay of commissary sergeants. An appropriation is needed to supply the judge advocate of the army with suitable libraries, and the secretary recommends that the corps of Judge advocates be placed upou the same footing as to promotion with the other staff corps of the army under existing laws. The bureau of military justice consists of one officer, the judge advocate general, and a corps of judge advocates of eight officers ot equal rank (major), with the provision that the limit of the coips shall remain at four when reduced by casualty or resignation to that number. The consultations of the bureau of military justice and tlie corps of advocates upon the same basis with other staff' officers of the army would remove an unjust discrim ination against deserving officers and sub serve tlie best interests of the service. Es pecial attention is asked to the report of the chief of engineers upon the condition of our national defences, from a personal inspection of many of our fortifications referred to. The secretary is able to emphasize tlie recom mendations made, and to state that their in complete and defenceless condition is desired by the country. While other nations have been increasing their means for carrying on offensive warfare and attacking maritime cities, we have been dormant in our prepara tion for defense. Nothing of importance lias been done toward strengthening and finishing our casemated works since our late civil war, during which great guns of modern warfare and heavy armored wooden fortifications and ships came into use among the different na tions, and our earthworks were left, by the sudden failure of appropria* ions some years since, in all stages ef incompletion, and are now being rapidly destroyed by tlie elements. Of It RIVER HICiHWAYS. Two great rivers ot the North American continent (the Mississippi aud Columbia) have their navigable waters wholly within the limits of the United States, and are of vast importance to our internal and foreign commerce. The permanency cd' tlie import ant work in the south pass of the Mississippi rever seems now to be assured. There lias been no failure whatever in tlie maintenance of a maximum channel (Tiring the six months ending August 9th, last. This experiment has opened a broad and deep highway to the ocean, and is an improvement upon the per manent success of which congratulations may be exchanged among people abroad and at home, and especially among the communities of the Mississippi valley, whose commercial exchanges flow in an unobstructed channel safely to and from the sea. This comprehen sive improvement of tlie Mississippi and its tributaries isa matter of transcendant import ance. These great waterways comprise a sys tem of inland transportation that spreads like a network over a large portion of the United States, and navigable to an extent of many thousands of miles. Producers and consum ers alike have a common interest in such un equalled facilities for cheap transportation. Geographically, commercially and politically they are the strongest lie between tlie various sections of the country. These channels of communication and interchange are the prop erty of the nation, and its jurisdiction is paramount over their waters. The publie interest requires their intelligent and careful supervision, with tlio view to the protection, improvement aud advancement of their usefulness. The channel of the Colum bia river, for a distance of about one hundred miles from its mouth, is obstructed by a suc cession of bars which occasion serious delays in navigation and a heavy expense for lighter age and tonnage. A depth of at least twenty feet at low tide should he secured and main tained to meet the requirements for the ex tensive and growing inland and ocean com merce it subverts. The most urgent need, however, for this great water-way is the per manent improvement of tlie channel at the mouth of the river. HARBOR WANTED. From the Columbia river to .San Francisco, a distance ot ever 600 miles, there is no har bor on tlie Pacific coast which can be ap proached during stormy weather. An appro priation of $159,000 was made by the 45th congress for the commencement of a break water and harbor refuge to be located at some point between tlie straits of Fuca aud San Francisco at which the necessities of com merce, local and general, will be best accom modated. The amount appropriated is thought to be quite inadequate for the purpose intended. The cost of the work when fin ished will he very great, owing to the want of natural advantages for a site at any point on the coast between! the designated limits, and it has not been thought advisable to un dertake the work without a larger appropria tion. I commend the matter to the attention of congress. I1UILDIXGS WANTED. The completion of a new building for the war department is urgently needed, and the estimates for continuing its construction are especially recommended. The collections of books, specimens and records constituting the army medical museum aud library are of national importance. The library now con tains about 51.500 volumes and 50,000 pam phlets relating to medicine,surgery undallied topics. The contents nf tlie army medical museum consists of 22,000 specimens, and are unique iu completeness, with which both military surgery and diseases of the armies are illustrated. Their destruction would be an irreparable loss not only to the United States bqt to the world. There are filed iu the record and dispersion division over 16,000 bound volumes of hospital records, together with a great quantity of papers embracing original records of hospitals of our armies during the civil war. Aside from their his torical value these records are daily searched for evidence needed in the settlement of a large number of pensions and other claims ; for protection of the government against at tempted frauds, s well as for the benefit of honest claimants. These valuable collections are now in a building which is peculiarly ex posed to the danger of destruction by fire. I' is therefore earnestly recommended that a i appropriation be made for anew fire-pro. f building adequate lor the present needs and reasonable future expansion of these valua alile collections. Such building should be absolutely fire proof. No expenditure for mere architectural display is required. It is believed that a suitable structure can be erect ed at a cost not to exceed $250,000. NEW MILITARY OFFICE. I commend to the attention ot congress the great services of the commander-in chief of our armies during the war for tlie Union, whoso wise, firm and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that momentous conflict to a close. The legislation of the United States contains many precedents for the recognition of distinguished military merit, authorizing rank and honore to be conferred for eminent service to the country : that congress author ize the appointment of a captain general of the army, with suitable provisions relating to compensation, retirement and other details, would, in my judgment, he altogether fitting and proper, and would be warmly approved by the country. NAVY' REPORT. The report of the Secretary of the navy exhibits a successful aud satisfactory manage ment of that department during the last fis cal year. The total expenditures for the year were $12,901,639, leaving unexpended at the close of the year, $2,141,682 of the amount of the availa ble appropriations. The appropriations for the present fiscal year ending June 30th, 1S81, are $15,095,060, and the total estimates for the next fiscal year ending ouue 30th, 1882, are $15,953,751. The amount drawn by warrant from July 1st, 1880, to November 1st, 1880, is $5,041,570. The recommendation of the Secretary of tlie Navy that some form of ciyil government for tlie people of Alaska be established, is approved. At present there is nolprotection of persons or property in that territory except such as is offered by tlie officers of the United States ship James town. This vessel was dispatched to Sitka because of the fear that without the immediate presence of national authority, there was an impending danger of anarchy. The steps taken to restore order have been accepted in good faith by botli the white and Indian in habitants, and the necessity for this method of restraint does not in my opinion now ex ist. If, however, the Jamestown should be withdrawn, leaving our people at the present without the ordinary judicial and adminis trative authority of an organized local gov ernment. serious consequences might ensue. The law provides only for tlie collection of revenue, the protection of public property, and tlie transmission of mails. Tlie problem is to supply a local rule for a popula ion so scattered and so peculiar in its origi n and con dition. The natives are reported to be tracta ble and self-supporting, ami if properly in structed doubtless would advance rapidly in civilization, and a new factor of prosperity would be added to our national life. Ï therefore recommend requisite legislation upon tlie subject. REPORT OF POSTMASTER-GENERAL The Secretary of the Navy lias taken steps towards establishing a naval coaling station at the Isthmus of Panama to meet the re quirements of onr commercial relations with Central and South America, which are rapid ly growing in importance. Locations emi nently suitable both in regard to our naval puposes and the uses of eommerc", have been selected, one on tlie easlsidoof the Isthmus at Cbirlqui Lagoon in the Curribean sea, and the other on the Pacific coast at (lie Ray of l'arita. The only sate harbors suliiciently commodious on tlie lsilimas are at these points, ami the distance between them is less that. 100 miles. The report of tlie Secretary of the Navy concludes with a valuable sug gestion with respect to building up our merchant ami marine service, aud which de serves tlie favorable consideration of con ress. The report of tlie postmaster-genet at ex hibits a continual growth and a high state of efficiency ot tlie postal service. The opera tions of no department of the government, perhaps, represent wit li greater exactness the increase iu population and the business of the country. In I860 the postal receipts were $8,518,067 ; in I860 the receipts were $33,315,479. All tlie inhabitants of tlie coun try are directly and personally interested iu having proper mail facilities, and naturally » atcii tlie post-office very closely. This care ful oversight on tlie part of tlie people lias proved a constant stimulus to improvement. During the past year there was un increase of 2,134 post-offices, and the mail routes were extended 27,177 miles, making an additional annual transportation of 10,804,191 miles. The revenues of tlie postal service for the en suing year are estimated at $38,S45,174, and the expenditures at $42,475,932, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the treasury of $3,030,757. Tlie universal postal union has received accessions of almost all countries ami colonies of tlie world maintaining an organized postal service, and It is confidently expected all other countries and colonies outside tlie union will soon unite therewith. Thus realizing tlie grand ideas of tlie founders of the union of form ing for the purpose of international mail com munication a single posial territory em bracing the world, with a complete uniform ity of postal charges and conditions of enter national exchanges for all descriptions of correspondence, to enable the United btates to do its full share of this great work, addi tional legislation is asked by tlie postmaster genera!, to whose recommendations especial attention as called. The suggestions of the postmaster-general that it would lie wise to etieouarge by appropriate legislat ion the estab lishment of an American ime of steamers by our own citizens to carry mails between our own parts and those of Mexico, Central America, South America and the trans pacific countries, is commended to tlie serious consideration of congress. The attention of congress is also invited to tlie suggestions of the postmaster-general in regard to postal savings. 

COURT MATTERS. J a of in The necessity for additional provisions to aid in tlie transaction of tlie business of the federal courts, becomes each year more appar ent. The dockets of tlie supreme court and of tlie circuit court in a greater number of ciscuits are embarasssed with the constant ac cession of cases. In tlie former court and in many instances in the circuit courts, years intervene before it is practicable to bring the cases to a hearing. The attorney general recommends the establishment of an inter mediate court of errors and appeals. It is recommended that the number of judges of the circuit court in each circuit, with tlie ex ception of the second circuit, should be in creased by the addition of another judge. In tlie second circuit that two should tie added that an intermediate court should be founded in each eircuit;to consist of a circuit judge and circuit justice and that in the event of tlie absence of either of these judges, tlie place of tlie absent judge should lie supplied by the judge of one of tlie district courts in the circuit. Such appellate court could be safely invested with large jurisdiction and its decis ion, Jwould satisfy tlie suitors in many cases where appeals would still lie allowed to the supreme court. The expenses incurred for this intermediate court will require a very moderate increase of tlie appropriations for tlie expenses of tlie department of justice. This recommendation is commended to the careful consideration of congress. It is evident that the delay of justice in many instances is oppressive and disastrous to suitors now necessarily occurs in federal courts which will in this way he remedied. REPORT OF SECRETARY OF INTERIOR. The report of the secretary of the interior, presents an elaborate account of the opera tions of that department during tlie past year. It gives me great pleasure to say our Indian affairs appear to lie in a more hopeful condi tion now than ever before. The Indians have made gratifying progress i:t agriculture, herd ing and mechanical pursuits. Many who were for years in hostile conflict with tlie government are quietly settling down on farms where they have made their permanent homes, building houses and engaging in oc cupations of civilized life. The introduction of the freighting business among them has been remarkably fruitful of good results in giving many of them congenial and remuner ative employment and in stimulating their ambition to earn their own support. Tlieir honesty, fidelity and efficiency as carriers are highly praised. The organization of a police force of Indians has been equally successful in maintaining law and order upon the reser vations and in exercising a wholesome moral influence among the Indians themselves. J concur with the secretary of the interior in the recommendation that the pay of this force be increased as an inducement to the best class of young men to enter it. Much care and attention have been devoted to the en largement of tlie educational facilities for the Indians, though the means available for this important object have been very inadequate. Additional boarding schools at Indian agen cies have been established and the erection of buildings has been begun for several more, but an increase in the appropriations for these interesting institutions is greatly needed to accomodate the large number of Indian children of school age. The number offered by their parents from all parts of tlie country for education in government schools is much larger than can be accommodated witli the means at present availabl for the purpose. The Indian schools established by the In terior Department in 1879, at Carlisle, Penn., uuder the direction of Capt. Pratt, has been equally successful, and it has now nearly 200 pupils, of botli sexes, representing a great variety of tribes east of the Rocky Mountains.. The pupils in both of these institutions receive not only an ele mentary English education, but are also in structed in housework, agriculture, aud use ful mechanical pursuits. Similar schools were established tliis year at Forest Grove, Oregon, for tlie educat ion of the Indian youth on the Pacific coast. In addition to this 30 Indian boys and girls were schooled from Eastern chinches, and placed m boarding schools in North Carolina, where they are to receive an elementary English education and training in industrial pursuits. The interest shown by ludian parents, even among so-called wild tribes, in tlie education of tlieir children, is very gratifying, and gives promise that the results accomplished by tlie efforts now making will be a lasting benefit. Tlie expense of Indian edueati n so far has been drawn from the government civilization fund at the disposal ot the department of the Interior; but the fund lias now been so much reduced that a continuance of tliis beneficial work will in the future depend on special appropriations by congress for that purpose, and 1 venture tlie express hope that congress will not permit institutions so fruitful ot good results to perish fin- want of menus for tlieir support. On tlie contrary an increase of members of such schools appear to me highly advisable. Tlie past year lias been unusually free from disturbance among In dian tribes. An agreement has been made with the Utes by which they surrender their large reservation m Colorado in consideration of an annuity to be paid them and agree to settle in severally on certain lands designated for that purpose as farmers holding individual title to their lands in fee simple inalienable for a certain period. In this way costly Indian wars have been avoided which at one time seemed imminent, and for first time in the history of the country anlndian nation lias given up its tribal existence to settle in severalty and live as individuals under common pro tection laws of country. Conduct of Indians throughout country during past year with but few exceptions been orderly and peaceful. The guerilla warlare carried on lor two years by Victoria and his band of southern Apaches haveyirlually come to an end by the death of that chief and most of his followers on Mexican soil. Disturbances caused on our northern frontier by Sitting Bull and ins men who had taken refuge in the British Domin ions, are also likely to cease. A large major ity of his followers have surrendered to our military forces, and the remainder are in pro gress of disintegration. 1 concur with the secretary of tlie Interior in expressing the earnest hope that congress will at this session take favorable action on tlie bill providing for tlie allotment of lands in tlie different reservations, in severalty to tlie Indians, with patents conferring fee simple and title inal ienable for a certain period, and the eventual disposition of the residue of tlie reservations for general settlement with the consent and tor the benefit of the Indians, placing the latter upder equal protection of tlie laws of the country. This measure, together with the serious prosecution ot our ednea tional efforts will work a most important and effective advance to tlie nation's wards. The solution of tlie Indian problem in p; paring tor tlie gradual merging of our lu,;;,.-; population iuto the great body of American citizenship. A large increase is reported in the disposal of our public lands for settlement during ! In; past year, which marks a prosperous growth of our agricultural industries and a vigorous move of the population toward our unoccu pied lands. As tliis movement proceeds codification of our land laws as well as pro per legislation to regulate tlie disposition of public lands, becomes of a more pressin«' necessity, and I therefore invito tiio alien-* tion of congress to a report ami accompany ing draft of a hill made by the public laud commission, which were communicated by me to congress at tlie last session. Earlv ac tion on tliis important subject is highly de sirable. The attention of congress is amiin asked to tlie wasteful depredations com nutted on our PUBLIC TIM BEK LANDS. and rapid and indiscriminate dent ruction of our forests. The urgent necessity for legislation to this end is now generally recognized in view of tlie lawless char acter of the depredations committed and the disastrous consequences which will inevitably follow their continuance Legislation lias again and again been recommended to arrest the evil and pre serve for the people of our western «tnt.« r the people of our western states and territories the timber needed for domestic and other essential use* report of the director of tlie The GEOLOGICAL SURVEY is a document ot unusual interest The consolidation of the various geological and geographical surveys and explorin enterprises each of which heretofore has operated upon the independent plan and without concert, cannot fui lto lie of great benefit to all those industries of the country which depend upon the deve opinent of our mineral rel, reel The labor of scientific men of recognizes] nient who composed the corps of leal survey, during tlie first seas.m iml whose field of operations and inquire* appear to have been very comprehensi ve? will soon be communicated <> ' in a number of volumes. u, ".-ress The director of the surer,,- ... that the investi gaüoÄXX"t toX U s^ h a\Ä^. h *!

AGRICULTURAL. Tlie commissioner of agricultun expressed a confident belief that forts in behalf of the production own sugar and tea have been eu t ingly rewarded. The importa: the results attained have atti, marked attention at home and hav ceived special consideration from eign nations. The successful cultin of our own tea and the manufuc-, our own sugar would make a di® of many millions of dollars aniim the wealth of the nation. Tlie commissioner asks attention ticularly to the continued prévalu tlie infectious and contagious cattl case known and dreaded in Euroi Asia as tlie cattle plague,or pleuro monia. A mild type of this dise, certain sections of our country is shilling great loss to our farmers, a source of serious disturbance trade with Great Britain, whii liishcs a market for most of stock and dressed meats. Tlie _ beef cattle exported from tlie f States for tlie eight months ended 31, 1880, was more than $12,090,1# ing nearly double the amount foi] same period in 1879—an unexainplj crease of export trade. Your earli tention is invited to this important ter. If EDUCATIONAL. The commissioner of edueati® ports a coni itilled increase of pubM teresl. in educational at lairs,and tl public schools generally through country are well sustained, indi training is attracting deservedattc and colleges for instruction in tin rctical and practical in agricultin mechanical arts, including the p ment schools recently established' strutting Indian youth, arc g steadily in public estimation. The commissioner asks special tion to the depredations eomniitttï the lands reserved for the future sag of public instruction, and to thei great need of help from the nation schools in the territories and the* ern states. The recommendation totorc made is repeated, and it is that an educational fund be set from the net proceeds of sales of tti lie lam Is annually, the income of » and the remainder of the net an proceeds to be distributed oil some factory plan to the southern states territories and the District of I'nlui The success of the public schools o District of Columbia and the prq made under the intelligent direct« the board of education and the slip tendent in supplying the education quirements of tlie District with tn and efficient teachers is very gratilj The acts of congress from time to' donating public land to several and territories in aid of cducatioiul terests have proved to lie wise mai of publie policy, resulting in great lasting benefit. It would scent to matter of simple justice to extend benefits of tliis legislation, the «si of which has been special iy vindi ' by experience, to the DISTRICT OF COLUMiUA I again commend the general in of the District of Columbia to the able consideration of Congress, affairs of the District ure in a vet) factory condition. In my annual sages heretofore and in my special sage of December 15th, *1-879, I urged uiion the attention of congre» necessity of reclaiming the maisln] the Potomac adjacent to the capital T am constrained by its inqiortaiitf advert again to tlie subject. Thcat embrace an area of several hui acres, they are an impedim-mt t city and seriously impair its healtt is believed with this substantial iiu] ment of its river front, the capital be in all respects one of the most live cities in the world. Aside fi* permanent population, this city cssarily the place of residence of I* 1 from every section of the cornttj gaged in publie service.

In addition t° ordinary use throughout the city, consumption l>y government is unt il,v very great in the navy yard, and the various departments, anil«" quantity is required lor the proper I ervation of the numerous parks cleansing of sewers.
