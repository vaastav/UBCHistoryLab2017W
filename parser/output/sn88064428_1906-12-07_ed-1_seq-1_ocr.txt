Our effort should be not so much to prevent comsolidation as sus. but so to supervise and ceontrol It na to see that It results In no harm to the Combination of capital, llke combina tion of labor, is a ecessary element of our present industrial qstem. It Is not possible completely to prevent It. and If tt were possible such complete prevention would do damage to the body politic. What we neood s not vainly to try to prevent all combina tlon, but to secure such rigoroum and adequate control and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their Injuring the public or existing In such form as Inevitably to threaten Injury. for the mere fact that a combination has secured practically complete con troi of a beeesuary of Iies would under any er·srances show that such combiation was to be presumed to be adverse to the publie interest It is unfortunate that our present laws should torbid al combinations nstead of sharply discriminating between those eombnations which do good and those embinations which do evil.

Our industrial development depends largely upon technical education. In cluding in this term all industrial eon eation, from that which fits a man to be a good mechanic, a good carpenter or blacksmith to that which fits a man to do the greatest engineering feat. The skilled mechanic, the skilled work man, ean best become such by tech nleal industrial education. The far reachlng usefulness of Institutes of t.bnaolog and schools of mines or of enginmering is now universally ac knowledged, and no less far reaching in the effect of a good building or me ebhncal trades school, a textile or watchmaking or engraving school In every possible way we should help the wageworker who toils with his bands and who must (we hope in a eanstantly incresing measure) alse otel with his brain. Under the constitu tion the national legislature aen do but Itle of direct Importance for his wel tam save where he in engaged in work which permits it to act under the in tfertate eolmerce clause of the consti tutbim, and this ib one reason why I so earnestly hope that both the legi atUe and judicial branches of the gov eranest will construe this clause of the coastltatiam in the broadest peod bis manner.

For several years evidence has been accumulating that additional leg islation Is needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphasizes the de fects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, because to leave them as they are means to in cur liability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has been a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30 per cent. - and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The secretary of the treasury had to step. in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. I do not press any especial plan. Va. rious plans have recently been pro posed by expert committees of bank ers. Among the plans which are posai bly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration is that re peatedly brought to your attention by the present secretary of the treasury, the essential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According to this plan, national banks should be permitted to Issue a specified proper tion of their capital in notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the Issue of currency to give banks additional prof its, but to meet the emergency present ed by times of stringency. I do not my that this is the right sys tem. I only advance Ir to emphasize my belief that there is need for the adoption of some system which shall be automatlc and opeb to all sound banks so as to avoid all possibility of discrimination and favoritism. The law should be amended so as speflcally to provide that the fund desired from custms duties may be htreated by the secretary of the tras ury U he treats funds obtained under thb innternal revenue laws. There should be a considerable increase in b ils o smanl denominations. Permis don should be gives banks, it necessa ry under settled rstrletios, to ret-e their irealatiom to a larger amout I than thee mmlos a month.
