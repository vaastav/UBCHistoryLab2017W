FORCE HEINZE TO CLAIM BIS INTEREST Vancouver, B. 0., Deo. I.—Presi dent Shaughneaay of the Canadian Pa cific has commenced an action against F. Augustus Heinze which involves $5,000,000 worth of land situated in East Kootenay. Curiously enough, suit is not brought by way of dispute regarding ownership, but Shaughnessy is triyng to force Heinze to come forward and claim his half interest in the lands. There are 760,000 acres, carrying coal and timber, given by the government of British Columbia to the Colubmia & Western railway, built by Heinze and since purchased by the C. P. R. By the terms of the purchase Heinze was to retain half niterest in the lands but he has so far declined to oome forward and take possession. The C. P. R. Wishes to dispose of half of the property, hence the action. Renounces Title of Earl Sheridan, Wyo., Deo.l .—The Hon.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 4 — President Roosevelt's message to con gress was presented at the opening of the sessions of congress this after noon. It is as follows: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: As a nation we still continue to en joy a literally unprecedented prosper ity; and it is probable that only reck less speculation and disregard of legit imate business methods on the part of the business world can materially :nar this prosperity. No congress in our time has done more good work of importance than the present congress. There were several matters left unfinished at your last session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will complete be fore your adjournment. I again recommend a law prohib iting all corporations from contribut ing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already passed one house of congress. Let individ uals contribute as they desire; but let us prohibit in effective fashion all cor porations from making contributions for any political purpose, directly or indirectly. Another bill which ha 3 just passed one house of the congress and which it is urgently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring upon the government the right of ap peal in criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists in many of the states; it exists in the District of Co lumbia by act of the congress. It is of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for the defendant on the merits should be set aside. Recently in one district where the government had indicted certain persons for con spiracy in connection with rebates, the court sustained the defendant's de murrer; while in another jurisdiction an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under it. and two defendants sentenced to im prisonment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflict with each other, but it is unfortunate that there should even be an apparent con flict. * * * It seems an absurdity to permit a single district judge, against what may be the judgment of the immense majority of his col leagues on the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "unconstitutional," and then to de ny to the government the right to have the supreme court definitely decide the question. Criminal Law. * * * I would like to call atten tion to the very unsatisfactory state of our criminal law, resulting in large part from the habit of setting aside the judgments of inferior courts on technicalities absolutely unconnected with the merits of the case, and where there is no attempt to show that there has been any failure of substantial justice. It would be well to enact a law providing something to the effect: No judgment shall be set aside or new trial granted in any cause, civil or criminal, on the ground of misdi rection of the jury or the improper ad mission or rejection of evidence, «r for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure, unless, in the opinion of the court to which the application is made, after an examination of the en tire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has re sulted in a miscarriage of justice. In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection with the issuance of injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the mat ter by the demand that the right of applying injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts; in which case of course the legislation would be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of in junctions. It is criminal to permit sympathy for criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no impairment of the power of the courts to deal with them in the most sum mary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some Buch law as I advocated last year. In this matter of injunction there is lodged in the hands of the judiciary a necessary power which is neverthe less subject to the possibility of grave abuse. It is a power that should be exercised with extreme care and should be subject to the jealous scrut iny of all men, and condemnation should be meted out as much to the judge who fails to use it boldly when necessary as to the judge who uses it wantonly or oppressively. Epidemic of Lyncmng. In connection with the delays of the law, I call your attention and the attention of the nation to the preva lence of crime among us, and above all to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up, now in one part of the country, now in an other. Each section, north, south, east or west, has its own faults; no sec tion can with wisdom spend its time jeering at the faults of another sec tion; it should be busy trying to amend its own shortcomings. To deal with the crime of corruption it is necessary to have an awakened pub lic conscience, and to supplement this by whatever legislation win add speed and certainty in the execution of the law. When we deal with lynching even more is necessary. A great many white men are lynched, but the crime is peculiarly frequent in respect to black men. The greatest existing cause of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black men, of the hide ous crime of rape—the most abovina ble in all the category of crimes, even worse than murder. Mobs frequently avenge the commission of this crime by themselves torturing to death the man committing it; thus avenging in bestial fashion the bestial deed, and reducing themselves to a level with the criminal. Incendiary Speeches. * • • Be it remembered, further more, that the individuals who, wheth er from folly, from evil temper, from gieed for office or in a spirit nf mere base demagogy, indulge in the inflam matory and incendiary speeches and writings which tend to arouse mobs and to bring about lyneihng, not only thus excite the mob, but tend by what criminologists call "suggestion," great ly to increase the likelihood of a repe tition of the very crime against which they are inveighing. When the mob is composed of the people of one race and the man lynched is of another race, the men who in their speeches and writings either excite or justify the action tend, of course, to excite a bitter race feeling and to cause the people of the opposite race to lose sight of the abominable act of the criminal himself; and in addition, by the prominence they give to the hide ous deed they undoubtedly tend to ex cite in other brutal and depraved na tures thoughts of committing it. Swift, relentless and orderly punishment un der the law is the only way by which criminality of this type can permanent ly be suppressed. In dealing with both labor and capi tal, with the questions affecting both corporations and trades unions, there is one matter more important to re member than aught else, and that is the infinite harm done by preachers of mere discontent. These are the men who seek to excite a violent class hatred against all men of wealth. They geek to turn wise and proper move ments for the better control of cor porations and for doing away with the abuses connected with wealth, into a campaign of hysterical excitement and falsehood in which the aim is to in flame the brutal passions of mankind The sinister demagogues and foolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign of destruc tion sometimes seek to associate them selves with those working for a genu ine reform in governmental and social methods, and sometimes masquerade as such reformers. • * * The plain people who think —the mechanics, farmers, merchants workers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe it to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be given pop ular government is to elect an un worthy and sinister agitator on a plat form of violence and hypocrisy. When ever such an issues is raised in this country nothing can be gained by flinching from it, for in such cases democracy itaelf is on trial, popular self-government under republican forms is itself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just as evil a thing as the triumph of the plutocracy, and to have escaped one danger avails nothing whatever if we succumb to the other. In the end the honest man, whether rich or poor, who earns his own living and tries to deal justly by his fellows, has as much to fear from the insincere and unworthy demagogue, promising much and per forming nothing, or else performing nothing but evil, who would set on the mob to plunder the rich, as from the crafty cormptionist, who, for his own ends, would permit the common people to be exploited by the very wealthy. If we ever let this govern ment fall into the hands of men of either of these two classes, we shall show ourselves false to America s past. Moreover if the demagogue and the cor luptionist often work hand in hand. There are at this moment wealthy re actionaries of such obtuse morality that they regard the public servant who prosecutes them when they vio late the law, or who seeks to make them bear their proper share of the public burdens, as being even more ob jectionable than the violent agitator who hounds on the mob to plunder the rich. There is nothing to choose between such a reactionary and such an agitator; fundamentally they are alike in their selfish disregard of the rights of others; and it is natural that they should join in opposition to any movement of which the aim is fear lessly to do exact and even justice to all. Eight-Hour Day. I call your attention to the need of passing the bill limiting the num ber of hours of employment of rail road employes. The measure is a very moderate one and I can conceive of no serious objection to it. Indeed, so far as it is in our power, it should be our aim steadily to reduce the num ber of hours of labor, with as a goal the general introduction of the eight hour day. There are industries in which it is not possible that the hours of labor should be reduced; just as there are communities not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good, or, if in the tropics, so situated that there Is no analogy be tween their needs and ours in the mat ter. On the Isthmus of Panama, for instance, the conditions are in every way so different from what they are here that an eight-hour day would be absurd; just as it is absurd, so far as! the isthmus 1b concerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work is done by alien black men or by alien yellow men. But the wageworkers of the United States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely In dustrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint it should be our object to do what we can in the direction of se curing the general observance of an eight-hour day. The congress at its last session wisely provided for a truant court for the District of Columbia; a marked step in advance on the path of prop erly caring for the children. Let me again urge that the congress provide for a thorough investigation of the conditions af child labor and of the tabor of women in the United States. Employer.' Liability. Among the excellent laws which the congress passed at the last session was an employers' liability law. It was a marked step in advance to get the recognition of employers' liabtl- Hy on the statute books; but the law did not go far enough. • • • Neith er the federal law, nor, as far as lam informed, the state laws dealing with the question of employers' liability are snfflciently thoroughgoing. The fed eral law should of course include em ployes in navy yards, arsenals and the like The commission appointed by the president Oct. 16, 1902, at the request of both the anthracite coal operators and miners, to inquire into, consider and pass upon the questions in contro versy in connection with the strike in the anthracite regions of Pennsylva nia and the causes out of which the controversy arose, in their report, find ings and award expressed the belief "that the state and federal govern ments should provide the machinery for what may be called a compulsory investigation of controversies between employers and employes when they arise." This expression of belief is de serving of the favorable consideration of the congress and the enactment of its provisions into law. A bill has already been introduced to this end. Coal Lands. It is not wise that the nation should aMenate its remaining coal lands. I have temporarily withdrawn from set tlement all the lands which the geo logical survey has indicated as con taining, or in all probability contain ing, coal. The question, however, cam be properly settled only by legislation, which in my judgment 3hould provide for the withdrawal of these lands from sale or from entry, save in certain es pecial circumstances. The ownership would then remain in the United States, which would not, however, at tempt to work them, but permit them to be worked by private individuals under a royalty system, the govern ment keeping such control as to per mit it to see that no excessive price was charged consumers. Corporations. The present congress has taken long strides in the direction of securing proper supervision and control by the national government over corporations engaged in interstate business. The passage of the railway rate bill, and only to a less degree the pure food bill, and the provision for increasing and rendering more effective national control over the beef packing indus try, mark an important advance in the proper direction. In the short session it will perhaps be difficult to do much further along this line; and it may be best to wait until the laws have been in operation for a number of months before endeavoring to increase their scope, because only operation will show with exactness their merits and their shortcomings and thus give op portunity to define what further reme dial legislation is needed. Yet in my judgment it will in the end be advis able in connection with the packing house inspection law to provide for putting a date on the label and for charging the cost of inspection to the packers. All these laws have already justified their enactment. The inter state commerce law, for instance, has rather amusingly falsified the predic tion, both of those who asserted that it would ruin the railroads and of those who asserted that it did not go far enough and would accomplish noth ing. During the last five months the railroads have shown increased earn ings and some of them unusual divi dends; while during the same period the mere taking effect of the law has produced an unprecedented, a-hitherto unheard ,of, number of voluntary re ductions in freights and fares by the railroads. Since the founding of the commission there has never been a time of equal length in which anything like so many reduced tariffs have been put into effect. On Aug. 27, for in stance, two days before the new law went into effect, the commission re ceived notices of over five thousand separate tariffs which represented re ductions from previous rates. • • • In some method, whether by a national license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far more complete control than at present over these great corporations—a control that will among other things prevent the evils of excessive overcapitalization, and that will compel the disclosure by each big corporation of its stockholders and of its properties and business, whether owned directly or through subsidiary or affiliated corporations. • • ♦ The best way to avert the very unde sirable move for the governmental ownership of railroads is to secure by the government on behalf of the peo ple as a whole such adequate control and regulation of the great interstate common carriers as will do away with the evils which give rise to the agita tion against them. So the proper anti dote to the dangerous and wicked agi tation against the men of wealth as such is to secure by proper legisla tion and executive action the abolition of the grave abuses which actually do obtain in connection with the busi ness use of wealth under our present system—or rather no system—of fail ure to exercise any adequate control at all. Inheritance Tax. • • • The national government has long derived its chief revenue from a tariff on imports and from an internal or excise tax. In addition to these there ia every reason why, when our next system of taxation is revised, the national government should im pose a graduated inheritance tax, and, if possible, a graduated income tax. The man of great wealth owes a pe culiar obligation to the state, because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of government. It should be one of our prime ob jects as a nation, as far as feasible, constantly to work toward putting the mechanic, the wageworker who works with his hands, on a higher plane of efficiency and reward, so as to in crease his effectiveness in the eco nomic world, and the dignity, the re muneration and the power of his posi tion in the social world. Unfortun ately, at present the effect of some of the work in the public schools is in. the exactly opposite direction. If boys and girls are trained merely in literary accomplishments, to the total exclu sion of Industrial, manual and tech* ideal training, the tendency i 8 tn „ « them ■ for industrial work and to «*? them reluctant to go into it or SS?" ted to do ff they do gVintol This ■Is a tendency which should £ strenuously combated. Our industn , development depends largely , ' technical education, including in A?. term all industrial education C 8 that which fits a man to be a good » chanic, a good 11 carpenter or hlaX smith, to that which fits a man to?" the greatest $ engineering f ea t Th° skilled mechanic, the skilled workman can best j become such by technical in' dustrial education. The far-reachin usefulness; of ; institutes of technoW and I schools of mines or of engineer ing is now ( universally acknowledged and no; less far-reaching is the effeS of va good building or mechanical trades school, a textile or watchmak ing "i or engraving % school. All such training must develpp not only manual dexterity, • but | industrial intelligence Iv international rivalry this country does not have to fear the competition of pauper labor as much as it has to fear the educated labor of specially trained competitors; and we should have the education of the hand eye and brain which will fit us to meet such competition. Help Wageworkers. In every possible way we should help the wageworker who toils with his hands and who must—we hone S a constantly increasing measure--ai^ toil with his brain. Under the cons, tution the national legislature can <in but little of direct importance for hi? welfare save where he is engaged h work which permits it to act under the interstate commerce clause of the con stitution; and this is one reason why I so earnestly hope that both the leg islative and judicial branches of the government will construe this clause of the constitution in the broadest pos sible manner. We can, however in such a matter as industrial training in such a matter as child labor and fac tory laws, set an example to the states by enacting the most advanced legis lation that can wisely be enacted for the District of Columbia. The only other persons whose wel fare is as vital to the welfare of the ■whole country as i 3 the welfare of the •* ageworkers are the tillers of the soil, the farmers. • * • The farmer represents a peculiarly high type of American citizenship, and he must have the same chance to rise and de velop as other American citizens have. Moreover, it is exactly as true of the farmer as it is of the business man and the wageworker, that the ultimate success of the nation of which he forms a part must be founded not alone on material prosperity, but upon high moral, mental and physical de velopment. The education of the lam er —self-education by preference, tout also education from the outside, as with all other men —is peculiarly nec essary here in the United States, where the frontier conditions even in the newest states have now nearly vanished, where there must be a sub stitute of a more intensive system of cultivation for the old wasteful farm management, and where there must be a better business organization among the fanners themselves. Farmers' Institutes. Great progress has already been made among farmers by the creation. of farmers' institutes, of dairy asso ciations, of breeders' associations, hor ticultural associations and the like. A striking example of how the govern -1 ment and the farmers can co-operate is shown in connection with the men ace offered to the cotton growers of the southern states by the advance of the boll weevil. The department is do ing all it can to organize the farmers in the threatened districts, just as it has been doing all it can to organize them in aid of its work to eradicate the cattle fever tick in the south. The department can and will co-operate with all such associations, and it must have their help if its own work is to be done in the most efficient style. Irrigation. Much te now being done for the states of the Rocky mountains and great plains through the development of the national policy of irrigation and forest preservation; not government policy for the betterment of our inter val conditions have been more fruitful of good than this. The forest of the White mountains and Southern Appa lachian regions should also be pre served; and they cannot be unless the people of the Btates in which they He, through their representatives in the congress, secure vigorous action hy the national government. Marriage and Divorce. I am well aware of how difficult it is to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless In my judgment th<? whole question of marriage and di vorce should be relegated to the au thority of the national congress. At present the wide differences in the laws of the different states on this subject result in scandals and abuses, and surely there Is nothing so vitally essential to the welfare of the nation nothing- around which the nation should bo bend Itself to throw every safeguard, as the home life of the aver age citizen. The change would w good from every standpoint. In Pa[' ticular it would be good because » would confer on the congress the pow er at once to deal radically and em dently with polygamy; and this should be done whether or not marriage anu divorce are dealt with. It is neither safe nor proper to leave the question of polygamy to be dealt with bytn° several states. Power to deal wIUi» should be conferred on the nation* government. Ship Subsidy Matter. Let me once again call the atten tion of the congress to two subjects, concerning which I have frequent^; before communicated with them, one is the question of developing Americas shipping. I trust that a law; embody ing in substance the views, or a major part of the views, expressed In the re port on this subject s laid before house at its last session will be pass*** I am well aware that to former year* objectionable measures have been pro posed in reference to the encoorafj ment of American shipping, bat .l seems to me that the proposed ure is as nearly unobjectionable •*•£ can be.
