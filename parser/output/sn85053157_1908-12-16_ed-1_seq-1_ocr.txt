The River Press. Vol. XXIX. Fort Benton, Montana, Wednesday, December 16, 1908. No. 8 THE WATERWAYS CONGRESS I mprovementjof Rivers and Harbors Urged As a National Policy. Washington , Dec. 9. —Sentiment in favor of a government bond issue for a comprehensive improvement of the rivers, harbors and canals of |tbe country, to the end that this nation shall have the greatest system of waterways in the world, gained head way at the opening session of the annual meeting of the rivers and harbors congress here today. The scheme contemplates 8500,000,000 worth of federal bonds for internal water courses, to be distributed over a 10-year period, to be $50,000,000 annually. President Roosevelt and President-elect Taft, before the joint conservation meeting, have advocated the issuance of government bonds for constructing permanent public im provements. Improvement of the waterways of the nation, members of the congress be lieve, will mean increased and cheap ened transportation facilities for the producer and the consumer, and that there is no question before the Amer ican people more worthy of their consideration than the proper develop ment and utilization of these natural channels of trade. Mr. Carnegie made a characteristic speech, in which he took issue with the pessimiste as to the future of the country. "These people," he said, "are al ways talking about how slow the world travels. The trouble with them is that they are looking forward too much. Let them look back where we once were and where we stand today.'' Mr. Carnegie gave his enthusiastic endorsement to the proposition advocated yesterday by President Roosevelt and President-elect Taft for the issuance of bonds for improve ment of our water courses. He be stowed great praise upon what he termed the brilliant work in connec tion with the Panama canal, but ex pressed the belief that the utilization of our own water ways was of in finitely more importance than the Panama canal. I Sentenced For Land Frauds. Washington , Dec. 8.—Frederick A. Hyde of San Francisco, recently convicted of conspiracy to defraud the United States of large tracts of land in Oregon and Washington, was today sentenced|in the district criminal court to pay a fine of $10,000 and to serve two years in the penitentiary at Moundsville, W. Va., the maximum penalty under the law. Joseph H. Schulder of Tucson, Ariz., an employe of Hyde's and con victed with him, was fined $1,000 and sentenced to one year and two months in the penitentiary. Both noted appeeals. Hyde was released on $20 000 bond and Schider on $10,000. The prosecution of Hyde and Schni der, together with John A. Benson and Henry P. Dimond, who were acquitted, following the investigation of alleged wholesale irregularities in public land deals in the west, cost the government $100,000 and the trial occupied three months. Bleached Flour Is Barred. Washington , Dec. 9.— Secretary Wilson of the department of agricul ture, today announced his decision that flour bleached with nitrogen peroxide is an adulterated product and cannot legally be sold in the Dis trict of Columbia or in the territories nor be transported in interstate com merce. Owing to the immense quan tity of bleached flour now on hand, secretary will recommend no prosecu tion of manufacturers or sellers for six months from this date. Held Up Great Northern Flyer Spokane , Dec. 10.—Three men held up ea&tbound Great Northern train No. 4 a mile and a half east of Hillyard, this state, at an early hour this morning, robbed the mail car acd made their escape. Only the presence of mind of W. Perrin. the fireman, prevented the looting of the express car, which carried a large amount of money, including $20,000 consigned from a Spokane bank to a Montana town. While two of them stood guard over the engineer, the other took Perrin back to uncouple the mail and express cars from the rest of the train. In the darkness, the bandit failed to note that the first car was the mail car, while the second was the baggage, and the express car, which contained the cesired booty, was third in the train. Perrin saw his mistake, and quickly taking advantage of it, in spite of the menacing revolver held close to his head, cut off the mail and baggage cars leaving the express car attached to the dead train. The robbers then left the engineer and fireman with the train and boarded the locomotive and them selves ran it several miles, where they brought it to a stop, rifled the mail car and again boarded the engine, after they uncoupled it from the cars, wbich they left on the track, and proceeded three miles to Mead. There a rig was awaiting them and they made their escape. Mead is only ten miles from Spokane. The amount of their booty is unknown. Official Canvass of Montana Vote.

CONVICTED OF GRAFTING. Notorious Political Boss Declared Guilty of Bribery. San Francisco , Dec. 10.—Abraham Ruef. former political boss of San Francisco, was convicted today of bri bery. The verdict was returned exactly upon the strike of four o'clock, after the deliberations of the jury had been prolonged throughout a period of 24 hours. The warnings of Judge Wm. P. Lawler, and the vigilance of the police, checked all attempted demon strations. although the excitement in the court room was so intense that men were thrust down into their seats or seized in the grasp of detectives as they rose to obtain a better view of the proceedings. The trial, which has been in pro gress for 106 days, ended with sur prising abruptness. The day had al most passed without a sign or inti mation from the curtained chamber on the upper floor of Carpenters' hall, the hopes of Ruef aud his attorneys had risen with every hour of delay, and the adherents of the prosecution were proportionately discouraged. With numbers and interest undimin ished, the hundreds of spectators who have clung about the court room dur ing the closing dayo of the trial, re tained their seats or stood hat in hand in a long line near the entrance, while a strong band of police watched vigi lantly for the first sigu of disorder in side, and patrolled every approach to the hall. Ten minutes before the verdict was returned, Francis J. Heney, the as sistant district attorney, who had charge of the trial, and who was shot down by Morris Haas on November 13, had been driven away from Car penters' hall in an automobile. Not withstanding the presence of a score of officers, who did all they could to restrain the demonstrations as Mr. Heney entered the court room, men and women rose to their feet, and cheered, waving hats or handkerchiefs until the bailiff and detectives inter fered. Billings , Dec. 10.— An organiza tion on the plan of the Farmers' Al liance, with the same name, was formed in a school house eight miles west of here last night. The plan as outlined is to allow the farmers to control prices of produce through a market which will he regulated by a warehouse and commission house in Billings. A bank owned by the far mers at which loans may be had on crops will be another feature. CONGRESS TAK ES NOTICE. Remarks In President's Message May Provoke Reply. Washington , Dec. 11.—Repre sentative Perkins of New York today introduced a resolution, which had been agreed upon, providing for the appointment of a special committee of five members to consider the proper means of dealing with that portion of the president's message which criti cizes the course of congress in prohib iting the detail of secret service men to duty outside of their own bureaus. The resolution is made to give voice to the feeling of the house. In presenting the resolution Mr. Perkins made a brief statement, say ing he was satisfied that the house would not hesitate to take such action as the dignity of that body required. He said that some of the president's expressions were unfortunate. The resolution was adopted. In submitting the resolution Mr Perkins said that the statements by the president could not be lightly disregarded as they might impair the usefulness of congress and that undue obtuseness might argue a lack uf pro per self-respect. A resolution similar to that passed by the house probably will be adopted by the senate early next week. It will provide for the appointment of a com mittee to recommend a course of action relative to the president's utterances. Congressmen Begin Work. Washington , Dec. 9.— A bill pro viding for the establishment of a tariff commission of seven members to fix the rates of duty on all imports was in troduced in the house today by Rep resentative Fowler of New Jersey. The house began regular business, considering a bill for the thirteenth census and an amendment excluding messengers, watchmen, unskilled laborers, etc., from the noncompetitive examination reguirements. The republican caucus today elected Senator Hale chairman, virtually making him the majortty leader. The senate received a mass of reports pre sented by Vice-President Fairbanks, including reports of the printing office, the secretaries of agricultural and treasury departments. A deluge of petitions followed. A Northern Pacific Wreck. Bismarck , N. I). Dtc. 10.— The wreck of the North Coast Limited at Mackenzie, on the Northern Pacific 20 miles east of here, last night, may be considered one of the most fortunate in the annul« «>f railroading, accord ing to railroad iiR'o. The fact that almost au t-Lt'in train, going at the rate of 50 mih— an hour, containing more tliu 2u0 persons, could turn over and d'uvu a 10 foot embank ment without, killing anybody, is mar velous. The train struck a broken rail. The engine got over safely, but the tender went off the track, followed by the baggage car and mail car. Then the coupling broke and the three day coache«, two sleepers and the observa tion ear went down an embankment into a deep snowdrift and turned over without breaking a coupling. The hard-pacited snow saved the train from destruction. For Waterways Improvement. Washington , Dec. 11.—With great enthusiasm the national rivers and harbors congress, at its concluding session here today, placed itself on record in favor of the issuance of government bonds for the improve ment of the great waterways projects. The congressldeclared for an author ized issue by congress, at its present session, of $500,000,000 worth of bonds, the proceeds to be used in the payment exclusively for such river and harbor work as may be author ized by congress, provision for the issue to be similar to the Panama ca nal bonds. A committee presented the bond res olution to Vice President Fairbanks and Speaker Cannon. Mr. Fairbanks expressed a favorable opinion of the proposition, but Mr. Cannon merely assured the committee that the résolu tion would be "referred for considéra tion." Vice presidents for the various! states were announced, among themi being: California, C. E. Crunskey of San Francisco: Idaho, W. B. Iley burn of Wallace: Montana. F. K. Stranahan of Fort Benton: Nevada, Francis G. Newlands. Suspected of Train Robbery. Spokane , Dec. 11.—That the trio of thugs who held up the Great Nor thern eastbound train No. 4. in = ide the Spokane city limits near Hillyard last night are none other than Ed. Frwikhauser and J. McDonald, with another pal who recently robbed the Oriental Limited of $40,000, broke jail at Helena later and gained no t" ipty by their mad spending of ill i in gains at Bonners Ferry dance 1 a, is the belief of the officers. The pair are known to have been at Butte and Anaconda less than one month ago. The Great Northern railway company has offered a re ward of $3,000 for their capture, and the amounts offered by the state and government bring the bounty on their heads to $6,000. Hearing On Wool Tariff Washington , Dec. 11.—Three wool growers were the only witnesses heard by the house ways and means com mittee at the tariff hearing today. R. G. Johnson, of Blackfoot, Idaho, who had been on the stand before, re turned to give the committee his figure* on the cost of raising sheep. These figures showed that the profits on a Hock of sheep in Idaho are 10 per cent. Solomon Luna, a wool grower of New Mexico, asked the committee to retain the present tariff on wool, say ing that he would like to have the duty increased if he thought there was any possibility of having it done. H. W. Kelly, representing the New Mexico Wool Growers' association, claliiud that the cost of raising sheep has increased, and asked to have the tariff on wool retained. Telephones Displace Telegraph. St. Paul , Dec. 11.—It was stated today, at the general offices of the Great Northern railway, that a tele phone system for train dispatching purposes was being installed on the Minot division, which extends from Devils Lake to Willist.on, a distance of 239 miles, and that the work of in stallation was nearly completed. When it is finished the telephoue sys tem will be extended from Williston to Cut Hauk, Mont., over the Mon tana division, a distance of 347 miles, and along the Butte division, which cover- 507 miles. Roosevelt Stands Pat. nt Washington , Dec. 12 — P lloosevelt told a number of callers at the white house today that lie stands for every word iu his message to con gress concerning the secret service, which has aroused the ire of both sen ators and representatives. The presi dent said that the action of either house or senate is of no consequence to him. He also stated that if congress fails to take favorable action upon his rec ommendations iu regard to the secret service, thus emphasizing the necessity of such action, he will send one or more special messages to congress »flowing the right of his contention. The members of the house and sen ate are wondering what the president is concealing, aud it is safe to say that many of the members of congress who have been in too close touch with various lobbies during the last few years are trembling over the result of an inquiry by the congressional com mittees of the president's statements in his message. Washington News Notes. Washington , Dec. 12.—The house today passed an amendment to the postal law, making the penalty for embezzlement or theft of mail by a postal employe a Qfine of $500 or im prisonment for five years, or both.| The government made a profit dur ing the fiscal year ending June 30, 1908, $10,541,371 on the coinage of sil ver, nickel and one cent bronze pieces. This represents the difference between the price paid by the government for the metals and their coinage value. What was practically a test vote on the bill providing for tho arbitrary investigation of differences between employers and employes in labor dis putes was taken in the house today when Townsend of Michigan sought to bring it up for further consideration. The opponents of the measure rallied their forces and the house, by a vote of 102 to 11. refused to take up the measure. , ,, î 4 ® Ar AI -^ S > " c - • ' am<-s ^ a ^ al |^ b * Great Northern detectives to be a professional bag gage thief who has operated exten sively on western train» between Great Falls and Helena and brought to this city, pleaded guilty to a charge of petty larceny and was sentenced to! serve six months in the county jail and pay a fine of $500. Walsh said he was penniless, so he will spend the next 14 months in the county jail. 

WEALTH FROM FARMS. Agricultural Products Lead All Others And Are Growing. Washington , Dec. 14.—"Tama Jim"' Wilson, who took the agricul tural department 12 years ago, when it was a joke, and since then convert ed it into one of the most importaut and efficient departments of the gov ernment, has just issued his twelfth annual report, a bulky pamphlet of nearly 200 pages, crammed with in formation about the resources and products of the country and the work of the department in relation thereto. There is no need to worry about our farmers' ability to keep us fed, accord ing to the report for. while the popula tion increases 124 per cent every 10 years, the agricultural yield is In creasing from 15 to 20 per cent in the same period. The farm value of all farm prod ucts of 1908 reaches the most extra ordinary total in the nation's history —$7,778,000,000. This is about four times tho value of the products of the mines, including mineral oils and precious metals. The farmer con tributes 87 per cent of the raw ma terials used in those manufacturing industries which depend mostly or considerably upon agricultural ma terials, and these industries use 42 per cent of all materials used in all industries. The gain In value of farm products in 1908 over 1907 is $290,000,000 and would have been much larger had not the prices of cotton and hay been low. During the last 10 years the wealth production on the farms of this coun try has exceeded the fabulous sum of sixty billion dollars. For Postal Savings Banks. Washington , Dec. 14.—In the sen ate today the postal savings bank bill was taken up as a special order, with every indication that it will re ceive favorable consideration from a majority of the law makers of the up per house. Senator Carter of Mon tana, who is in charge of the measure, gives it as his opinion that the bill will pass the senate without opposi tion of any serious kind. Both the president and the postmaster general favor the passing of the bill. The fate of the measure in the house is problematical, as Speaker Caunon in opposed to it, but it is believed that the influence of President-Elect Taft will be sufficient to overcome the opposition of the speaker. Montana Matters In Congress. Washington , Dec. 11. — Represen tative Charles N. Pray is working hard for his bill to divide Montana into two federal districts, one for the western part of the state, and the other for the eastern portion. It is understood that the bill will pass this session, as there is no opposition congress and the bar of Montana has recommended it. The bill divides Montana into two districts, the eastern district contain ing Billings, Helena and Great Falls as the places of holding court, and the western division comprising Butte and Missoula as the court towns. This will ust about cut Judge Hunt's work in two. A bill to relieve Postmaster Mai , Dr.
