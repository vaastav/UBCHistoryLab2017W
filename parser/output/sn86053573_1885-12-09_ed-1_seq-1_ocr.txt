VANDERBILT IS DEAD, THE RICHEST MAN' IS THE WOULD IS GONE. Stricken Suddenly, Without Warning, Willie Conversing at tho Telephone Dentil tVa Painless Tho ltnllroad King's Urcnt Wealth. William II. Vandcrbllt dropped dead at bis homo on Fifth avenuo this afternoon at 3 o'clock. Tho cause ot his death was paralysis of tbo brain. During tho morn lug ho bad been moro than ordinarily alert and active, so much so that It oxcttcd com ment, to which bo replied In a good hum ored and Jocular vein. IIo had eaten a good breakfast, and was looking forwanl with pleasant anticipations to a rido on tbo boulevard with bis son-in-law, Hamilton McK. Twombly, In tbo afternoon. At 11 o'clock bo sent to tho Grand Central depot for bis old friend Chauuccy M. Dcpow, president ot tbo Now York Central railroad. Mr. Dcpow was engaged In a confcrcnco nt tbo depot, and scut word that ho would not bo nolo to como for an hour or two, and Mr. Vandcrbllt delayed tbo appointment till 10 o'clock, and, to occupy tho Interval, went down to tho studio of J, (J. A, Ward, tho sculptor, In West Fifty-third street, to sit for a bronzo bust of himself, which tho trustees ot tho Coll ego ot Physicians and Surgeons wished to placo In the vestibule ot tho college, for tho erection ot which ho recently gavo halt a million ot dollars. IIo returned to tako lunch at 13:30 with bis wife, his son Ocorgo, and Mr. Twombly, and at tho tablo was noticeably bright and cheerful. At 1 o'clock Mr. Robert Garrett tho president ot the Italtlmoro and Ohio rail road, called upon Mr. Dencw nt tho Grand Central depot, and, finding him still de tained there, went up to Mr. Vanderbllt's houso to Inform Mr. Vandcrbllt and tako Mr. Dcpow's place. Mr. Vandcrbllt greeted him cordially and engaged In a long and animated conversation wuu nun auoui rail road matters. Tbo gilt Iron cross over tho gato that leads to tho grounds ot tho Roman Catholic orphan asylum on Filth avenuo gleamed brightly under tho electric lamp to-night as seen from tho grand cntranco of tho Van dcrbllt mansion, directly opposlto, against tbo somber gray of tho nurblo cathedral. It was tbo only cheerful thing, In the wide de serted avenue, that seemed stricken as with sudden death. Kays of Its brightness wcro reflected In tho windows of tho huge brown stone pile, behind whoso closo curtains tbo richest man In tho world lay doad, stricken suddenly and without warning. Tbo busy bum of trafllc and tho noises of tho street wore bushed on tho block. Car riages turned out rather than pass tho brown stono palace, and passers-by stopped to Inquire of somo casual pollcomau If It was truo that the millionaire was dead. Being told .. 'hat thoy had heard aright, the).' went their way, sobered and silent, tarrying mayhap a mlnuto to gazo on tho bugo stono pile, inside, servants and friends tip-toed about with gravo and saddened faces. Tho door-boll was rung every minute, and tho wldo portals swuug open to admit other friends who camo to mourn with tho mourners. Upstairs, behind tho drawn cur tains of the millionaire's bedroom that shut out tho sight ot tbo friendly cross, wcro sobs and tears. Tlio children of tbo dead man wcro gath ered there In bis bedroom about tho corpse Mono of them bad been with him IK Tnn IIOl'Il OF 1119 

DEATH. To none bad bo had tlmo to speak a word of farewell. As ho lay upon the carved bed In tho largo square room, tho windows of which overlook tho avenuo from tho northeast corner ot the south wing of tbo building to tbo left of tho matn entrance, Mr. Vandcrbllt looked as If bo had fallen In a gcntlo sleep. His features wcro peaceful aud ns natural ns If ho had just ceased talk lug and laid down to rest. His Jdeatb has been painless as it was sudden. A THtAMATIO f-CESC. Tbo confcrcnco lasted moro than an bour, nnd Mr. Vandcrbllt sent word to bis son-in-law, Mr, Twombly, tbat bo would bo com pelled to forego tbo Intended tlrivo. Tho two railroad magnates wcro discussing tho new terminal facilities ot tho Baltimore and Ohio, tbo new Inlet Into tho city It bad so cured by way of Statcn Island, and Mr. Vandarbllt took a lively Interest In the results that wcro to ioiiow ior tno isianu oi nis uirtu from tbo new enterprise. It was wbllo the talk turned upon this, tbo scenes of blscbildbood, and early work, contrasted with tho tremendous achievements of his rlpo old age. that Mr. Garrett, sitting on a sofa and facing tho millionaire, who leaned forward In bis arm chair, as was his habit when thoroughly lutcrcstcd, that tho presi dent of tho Baltimore and Ohio Ilallroad Company was suddenly made nwnro of a slight Indistinctness In Mr. Vanderbllt's speech that grew Into au lnartlculato sound. As ho leaned over to catch bis words Mr. Vandcrbllt pitched forward without a word or warning, aud fell heavily to tho floor on his faco. Mr. Garrcttsprang to his feet with an exclamation ot alarm, and seizing a pillow from tbo sofa, laid It under his friend's head, then summoned Mrs. Vandcrbllt and George, tho youngest son. Messengers were sent In basto for phy sicians. Ono from tbo neighborhood responded first, aud was followed al most immediately by tho family doctor, Dr. James McLean. Such slmplo restora tives as wcro at baud bad been hurriedly nnpllod, but human aid was In vain. Mr. Vanderhllt novcr snoko or moved after bo tell under tbo sudden stroke and died within a few minutes without a struggle To all Intents and purposes ho was dead tbo Instant ho fell forward upon tho floor. It was 3:30 o'clock when Dr. McLean led tho stricken widow from tho room where her husband bad sat planning and working In tbo full prldo of health and strength Ave minutes before. Dr. McLean pronounced his death tho result of a sudden stroko ot paralysis, duo to tho bursting of a largo blood vessel nt tho baso of tho brain, ot tbo kind that aro absolutely fatal nt tho moment, aud stated tbat his death was as painless as It was sudden. Tho doctor knew Ills patient most Intimately, and promptly ccrtlllcd to tho cause of death, to avoid the unnecessary formality of n coroner's Inquest aud an au topsy. As soon as It was ascertained beyond doubt that Mr. Vandcrbllt was dead tho men servants wcro summoned and helped to carry tbo body of tbo dead master up stairs to tbo bedroom bo bad occupied In life. Mrs. Vandcrbllt was prostrated with frlcf, and telephone messages wcro sent to ho Grand Central depot to summon her sous, and to tbo rcsidenco or tier sons-in-law to Inform them ot tho death of Mr. Vandcrbllt. Cornelius, Wllllaru K., and Frederick YV. Vandcrbllt bad beon together In tbo unices at tho depot less than halt an hour beforo tbo messago came, and had gnno uway together, Tho mes sago found Cornelius Vandcrbllt In a meeting of tbo trustees of tho American lllblo Society at tho lllblo Houso. Ho has tened at onco to tho houso, whither Mr. Dcpow bad preceded him, dumb with dis tress over bis friend's death. Hy degrees tho other children arrived, and as tho report spread with (ho rapid ity ot lightning through the city, thoy wcro followed by tlio nearer friends of tho dead magnate. Universal consternation and grief prevailed at tho most unexpected news of tho death of Mr. Vnnflcrbllt. Mr. Vandcrbllt, whllo bo bad for two years past been a victim moro or less of Indigestion with Its attendant Ills and kindred serious disorders, has lately, despite tho frequent reports ot bis death, been apparently meuiPug. Hod Mr. Vandcrbllt lived to May 8 noxt year bo would havo been 05. IIo was bom In tho Statcn Island homestead on that dato In tho year 1831. Tbo nearness of the tlmo, which ho himself considered critical, gavo him no apparent concern, however. Ho did not expect, but neither ho foar death. It camo to him, If very swiftly, very gently. Ho did not know It when It seized lilm. Uy arrangement of tho nearest friends wllh members of tho family It was decided that TUB FUNEllAt, was to Ihj on Friday noxt at 10 o'clock from St. Bartholomew's Church, nt Madison avenuo and Forty-fourth street, of which tho Itov. Dr. Cook Is tho pastor. Mr. Van dcrbllt was a vestryman In tbo church, to the construction of which ho contributed largely. Tlio sexton of tbo church was charged with the funeral arrangements. At Mr. Vanderbllt's own desire, bo will bo ln tcrrcd In tbo family mausolcmu In the Moravian Cemetery at Now Dorp, Statcn Island, whlchhas just been compfctod. It was ONE Or THE LAST ACTS IK HIS LIFE to turn over by deed for $1 In band, paid of good and lawful money, all tho old farm property of tho family on Statcn Island to bis youngest son George, to do with as ho desired, and for this purposo father and son Visited aud went over tbo Island together on Saturday last, Incidentally Inspecting also tho mausoleum. Mr, Vandcrbllt had made n will. What Its provisions aro Is not known to any ono outsldo ot tho nearest members of tbo fam llv and bis confidential counsel nnd friend, Mr. Dcpcw. But the Vatidcrhllts wore a very united family, and Mr. Dcpow ven tured tho prediction to-day that tho million aire's death would mako no chango In ox isttug conditions. VANDEIlDII.T'fl CHEAT WEALTH. Vandcrbllt was worth $300,000,000, al though his fortuno shrank last year ma terially through a big decline ot stocks nnd through business depression, but tho bull movement In tho past few months brought It up agalu, His Income was cal culated as follows i $3.a3,000 a year from government bonds, $7,!9I,000 from railroad stocks, $."70,G93 from miscellaneous securi ties; total, over 810,000,000 n year, $30,000 a day, $1,300 an hour, or $10.75 n minute. IIo mado no ostentatious display ot bis wealth and was charitable, although In this bo bad to bo quiet or ho would havo been overrun by Impostors. CONSTEHNATION AMONO IUtOKEltS AND SrECU I.ATOUS. The death of Mr. Vandcrbllt creates con sternation among Wall street men and speculators. Tlio Windsor Hotel was thronged with them to-night, and a feeling verging on that displayed In financial panics prevailed. Awful thlugs were predicted and expected to-morrow, as soon as tho stock market opens. So excited wcro brokers that thoy stayed out unusually lato and discussed tho probabilities and possibilities. Ono good uuthorlty had It tbat Vandcrbllt had, In anticipation of fateful emergency, vested In ono of bis sons tho power of attorney, and heneo no trnublo need bo feared as tho re sult of his death. This alleged empower ment, bowovcr, was denied by President Depcw, of tho New York Central rail road, who said that tho great magnate's affairs wcro so arranged that no an offense. Ho said a good many things to serious or even considerable disaster would follow bis death. IIo did not bcllevo New York Central or Michigan Central, In which Vandcrbllt was largely Interested, would suffer. Speaking of Mr. Vanderbllt's per sonal traits, Mr. Dcpow said ho was gener ous, open-hearted, and blunt and frank, but Whatever no satu was goou-naturcu, tnougn strangers wcro apt to mlsconstruo his out-spoken languago as almost find out opinions rather than to anger any ono. President Dopow says that Mr. Van derbllt's Arm, hearty handshaking with his subordinates and bis frank "How aro you," did moro to Inspire aud encourage than raising salaries. Mr. Vandcrbllt left a will, but Dcpcw said bo did not know its pro visions. Vandcrbllt usually aroso at 7 o'clock regularly every morning. IIo was fond of homo and the family circle, loved family Intercourse aud whist evenings, and doted on music and opera. oriNioNS or am. VANDEnmir. Jay Gould, In an Interview with u re porter ot tho Associated Press this evening, said: "Mr. Vanderbllt's death was certainly a surprlso to mc, and a sad ono, too. His death will bo a great loss to tbo world of business and finance, for ho certainly was tho foremost figure In many ot tho grcatost enterprises that haxo been carried out In this country during tho past twcnty-llvo years." "You havo been Intimately ac quainted with Mr. Vandorbllt for many years, havo you uott" asked tbo reporter. "I first met and became acquainted with Mr. Vanderhllt In 1807. At that tlmo ho was president ot tho Krlo railroad and ho was vico president of tho Hudson Itivcr railroad. I found him to bo a man of wldo resources aud sound Judgment. Afterwards ho bccamovlco president of tho Now York Central, and llgtircd extensively In tho building up of tho business of that road. Our relations, up to tbo tlmo of his death, bad olways been ot a pleasant character. "What Is your opinion of Mr. Vandcrbllt as a financier?" "I havo for many years considered Mr. Vandcrbllt as a man of unusual ability tu tbo management of largo llnauclal Inter ests. When his father died and bo camo lu possession of his vast fortune, Mr. Van dcrbllt was not long In demonstrating his ability to manago tho property which had been Intrusted to bis care. IIo mado no movo on tbo checker-board ot finances until bo felt satisfied tbat his movo was a safe one to mako. He would not run a great risk unless he was absolutely compelled to by forco of clrcumstauccs, which I as sure you was not very often. Ills Judg ment npon values was always sound. Few men havo mado so fow mistakes In tbo handling of financial Interests as Mr. Van dcrbllt." J. Plcrpont Morgan said that Mr. Van derbllt's death would bavolittlonr no effect on tbo stock market, that tho West Shore negotiations would go on as before, and tbat a cablegram has been scut to Loudon with tho Information of his death, which, no doubt, would bo received there with a great deal of regret. Pool Commissioner Fink said that Mr. Vanderbllt's death would havo no effect on tbo pooling arrangement, as ho had been out of tho agreement for somo tlmo.

TIIK MIBSAGK IN NEW YORK. A VAIIIETY OF OPINION'S IlKaAItDIXO ITS 8COPB AND KFFKOT. An Old-Fnshlnncd l'roo l'lclit nl n Democratic Meeting A Co-Consplrn-tor of rcrdlimnd Wnrd Arrested for 1'rnuclulent I'ructlces. New Yoiik, Dec. P. 2 a. m. The Trlbttno to-day will say editorially: Tho first messago of tlio President Is a crod liable paper. On somo or tho most Important questions of which It treats It deserves hearty praise. Nor Is It tn him discreditable, but much to his credit, that Isbcst and most worthy of commendation lust whero bis party Is worse, and most to bo feared. No parly spirit is approprlato tn Judging of tho recom mcndatlous which tho President has to oiler. Ho has been Intrusted with n great responsibility. For tho l'rosldont and his party tho cm of crltlolsm or promises Is over, llotn are now to bo Judged liv their performance, their capacity lu practical ad ministration. Ilouca It Is approprlato to ob serve that tlio message, whllo dosorvlng of his commendation In many respects, Is likely In Us best features to meet thcdctcrmlnodopposttlon of Ihe party lu power. T ho President's mes sage Is mot right Just whera his party Is most wrong, nnd his best advlco is Just that which Is least Ilkclv to bo followed. Tho Presi dent's argument for tho suspension of silver colnago Is earnest, strong, and convinc ing. What tho President says about tbo re form of civil scrvlco will be contrasted, not to bis credit, with somo of his appointments. It must bo Inferred, cither that tho President's declarations express n purpose which Is not always prccnt In his mind, or that tho In. llncnce of his party Is at times with him so cvcrpowcrlng, and Is generally so hostlloto tho principles of reform, that ho Is made to ap pear llko tbo waterman, looking ono way and rowing tho other. Thcro Is ono suspicious portion of tho messnge, and which tho Presi dent argues that In a time of strong partbun excitement tho solectlon of snlwrdlimics who nro Inform rathy with thcappolntlngpowcr, and the removal ofsurbordlnatcs not iollttcally in sympathy with the appointing power, nro no ecssnry to tho et!lc!cncy of the sorvlce. It may lie that tho President Is not nwnro that this lino of reasoning prepares tbo way, not merely for a defeat of all his professions, but for tho repeal of tba civil scrvlco act Itself. Tho Presi dent Is open to moro sovcro censure for his unreserved approval of tbo courso which somo members of his Cabinet havo taken. Tho President docs not seem to havo duly considered that It may bo even worso for tho country, by crudo or hasty "reforms," lo expose it to tho evils from which tho wisdom of past statesmen havo preserved It, than to bear existing Ills, until rcnicdlcsthataro surely wlto and sato can bo matured.

CLEVE LAND'S FlItST MES3AOE. New Yoiik, Dec. 8. From President Cleveland's well-known attltudo on tbo .sil ver colnago question, ever sluco ho wrote bis famous congressional letter last year, tbo clauso In bis messago favoring tho re peal of tho compulsory colnago act was no surprise to-day to Wall street, nnd meets with general approval from bankers and bullion men. J. It. Kennedy, vico president of tho Manhattan Bank, said: "With such a dol lar tbo sooner tlio colnago Is stopped tbo better. I havo no objection to an honest silver dollar, but SO cents will not buy a dollar's wortb of valuo abroad." J. 1). Colgate, bullion deolcr, of Wall street, said: "Tho idea ot tho President Is a good one, but Congress will not support him In his recommendation. Tbo silver men and tbo members from tho wost will certainly opposo any such measure." O. I). Baldwin, president of tbo Fourth National Bank, said: "I have exhausted myself on tho subject, aud need only now say that I perfectly ngrco with tho Presi dent's recommendation." Francis 1). Palmer, president ot tho iiroauway national nam;, sunt: ino pres ident is quite right, and should bo strongly supported In bis effort to stop silver coin age. It will be a great relief to thocountry It tho compulsory mcasuro Is put out of the way." W. J. Quintan, cashier ot tbo Chemical Bank, seemed surprised when ho beard tho uows. Ho said: "It was certainly tlmo to call a halt to the colnago of silver dollars. In a short tlmo we should havo boon on a silver basis. Wo must let tho world know tbat tho United States Is not tho dumping placo for their silver. Now is tho tlmo tu call lu gradually tbo legal tender promises to pay.aud Issue certificates based on coin tho silver In tho treasury If you will. Thoy would represent something taugilila which tho legal tenders do not. At any rato stop tbo further colnago of silver dollars." A special meeting of thocbambcr of com incrco will beheld on Thursday afternoon to consider what action tbo chamber will take In support of the recommendation of tho President In regard to tbo repeal of the law. Tho Evening Post simply prefaces Its edi torial summary of tbo President's message as follows: Wo aro sorry that President Cleveland has depatted In bis first messago from his practlco of making his stato papers short, because, In uocumcuinui inuEtin, wnai is e'lincu in ex tension Is lost In intention, as tho logicians say. Tbo Mail and Exprcsssays tho messago Is ponderous, but that "the general under lying principles at the messago are those ot an honest aud earnest Democrat whoso con victions as to tho limitation of the sphere and functions of tbo federal government are very clear and stiong. In tbo application of tbo principles, and lu tho application of tho settled American principles as regards our foreign relations, Mr. Cleveland shows togood advantage." Tbo Commercial Advertiser says : The general tono of tho messago cannot fall to satisfy tbo public mind that tho President Is dl osed to patriotic and conservative courses: that bis earnest destro Istoadmlulster tho gov ernment In tbo lutorost of tho country's pros perity and honor; that ho seeks to found his policy mid order his courso upon tho broad principles of tbo fathers: and that his compre hension ofthc fundamental truths of states manship nnd the groundwork of our Institu tions Isbroad and thorough. Tho Invitation Is lo such laying aside nf tho spirit of part Wan ship as shall prevent It Irom obstruction tho accomplishment of dcslrablo publlo cuds, aud It amounts to a pledge on his part to conduct his administration In a spirit ofcoraprchcnslvo patilothm, nine riniiT at a democratic meeting.

Gleason picked up a chair and was about to strlko tbo supervisor with It when Morris Smith, of Astoria, caught tho chair ond wrenched it from Gleason. A general row ensued between the Gleason audautl Gleason factions, during which Patrick J. Murphy, of Astoria, nttacked Gleason. Gleason partly drew his revolver, but, as Murphy said ho bad no weapon, thcro was no shootlug. Several members bad their beads cut. A CO-CONSl'IIIATOIt

To the CoNonr.su or the U.mtedStates: Your assembling Is clouded by a sense ot public bereavement, caused by tho recent and sudden death of Thomas A. Hendricks, Vice President of tho United Slated. ltl distinguished public services, bis complete Integrity nnd devotion to every dutv, and his personal virtues will find honorablo record In his country's history. Ample nnd repeated proofs of tho esteem and confidence tn vt hlch he was held by hbt fellow-countrymen wcro manifested by bis election to ofllces of the most Important trust aud highest dignity; and at length, full ot years and honors, bo has been laid at rest amid universal sorrow and benedic tion. Tho constitution, which requires thoso chosen toleglslato for tho peoplo to annually meet In tho dlschargo of their solemn trust, also requires tho President to glvo to Cou grcss Information of the stato of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as ho shall deem necessary and expedient. At the threshold of a compli ance nllh tbeso constitutional directions, It (swell for us to bear lu mind that our use fulness to the people's Interests will bo pro moted by a constant appreciation of the scopo and character of our rctpcctlvc duties os they rclato to federal legislation, Whllo tho Executive may recommend such meas ures ns bo shall deem expedient, tbo re sponsibility for legislative action must and should rest upon thoso selected by the peo ple to mako their laws.

Our posi tion after nearly a century ot successful constitutional government, maintenance ot good faith lu nil our engagements, tho nvoidaiico ot complications with other na tions, und our consistent and amicable at titude toward the strong and weak alike, furnleh proof ot a political disposition which renders professions of good will un necessary: There aro uo questions ot dlfll culty pending wltb any foreign govern ment.
