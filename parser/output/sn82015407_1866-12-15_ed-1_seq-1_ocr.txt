Nkw Tore, Dec. 3.—The President's Message to Congress opens with a reference to the goodness ■of an all wise and merciful Providence in abating the pestilence, which left its calamitous traces upon portions of the country. Peace, order, trau <i'iility, civil authority exists throughout the land. Civil authority has superceded the coercion oj su ms. People of all the States are voluntarily maintaining the government in full activity and complete operation. The enforcement of the laws is no longer obstructed anywhere by combinations t,<>o powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.. Animosities en gendered by war are rapidly yielding to the benefi cent influences of free institutions, The entirrres toration of fraternal feeling must be the earnest wish of every patriotic heart. ' Previous to the assembling cf last Congress the Executive had accomplished- nearly all within the scope of hi « authority to restore the insurrectioo nry States to their relations with the general gov «rament. To complete the restoration only re quired* the admission to Congress of loyal Sena-' tors and Representatives from the lately rebellious Hutes, Congress, however, hesitated until'the dose of the eight, months' session,- when there was an exceptional case made, providing lor the admission of Representatives from Tennessee. I deem it a subject of profound regret that Con gress waited to admit loyal Senators And Repre sentatives from other States, whose inhabitants, like those of Tennessee, had rebelled. The President proceeds to recapitulate his for mer arguments that the rebellious States, having always bees in the Union, and subject to taxation, conid not, under the- Constitution, be deprived of representation without their consent. His con victions, heretofore expressed on this subject, liHve undergone no change, but on the contrary have been confirmed By time and reflection. The Constitution makes it the dutv of the Pre aident to recommend to thè consideration of Cod* gross sud) measures as lie deems expediént, I know of no measure more imperatively demanded by every consideration of national interest, sound policy, and equal justice, than the admission of loyal members from now unrepresented States. This would consummate their restoration, and ex ert a most salutary influence in the re-establishs ment of peace, harmony and fraternal feeling, lend greatly to renew the confidence of the Amer ican people in the vigor and stability of their in stitutions, bind us more closely together as a na tion, and enable us to show the world the inherent and recuperative power of a government founded upon the will of the people and established upon principles of liberty, justice, and intelligence. Our increased strength and enhanced prosperity would demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free institutions drawn from our recent national disorders by the enemies of republican government. The admission of Joÿal members *rom the now excluded* States, by allaying doubt aod apprehension, would turn capital into the channels of tradE and industry, induce immigra* tion, lead to an increased production of the great staples which have added largely to the wealth of the nation and the commerce of the world. New fields of enterprise would be opened, war's devastations be soon repaired, and all traces of our domestic differences effaced. He cites extracts from Washington, Jefferson and Jackson against consolidation and supporting btfttcs rights. • * 4 . Referring to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury he reaffirms the general views of his last annual message, concerning the currency, the proper adjustment of the revenue system, internal and external, and qrges carrying into.every de partment of the goverinent rigid accountability', thorough retrenchment, and wise economy. The oppressive burdens of taxatiou can tie lessened by Modifications of the revenue l.-ws, consistent with the public faith ^nd tue legitimate wants of the .government. *> The national finances are in a more satisfactory condition than the most sanguine could have an ticipated* Daring the last year of the war, the debt increased $942,000,000. During the n months ending with October last, the $8 reduced over $306,000,000. For the year •ernlmg with June last, the * its of the Treasury ^[a/Î? 50 ' 000,0 ? 0 ' aad th penditures $565, 

OOO^OOO, expenditures $31t>,w00,0qo. (Which to t>elieve l) in view of these facts and the growing wealth of the country, taxes may be materially reduced and the debt extmguised within a quarter of a century. ^ The President summarizes the report of the Secretary of War. The army is to be furnished with breech-loading small arms, and sufficient war material for any emergency retained, barge armies can be organized from disbanded volunteers, who are always ready to respond to the national call. The total estimate for military aunrouria fiiona k $20,000,000. PP P The President says the Secretary of the Navy reports a naval force of 278 vessels, carrying 2,351 guns, and 13,600 men. One hundred and fifteen vessels are in actual service. The Executive re commends the provision of a suitable public sta tion, where ironclad vessels can be kept ready for any emergency. The navy expenditures for the year ending with June were $43,000,000. The Postmaster-General reports a satisfactory condition of that department. The revenue for the year ending June, was 114,380,000, and the enditures $15,300,000, the deficiency being led by the extension of the Southern service. a. ne basis of a new postal convention with Eng nd has been agreed upon for the reduction of ternatioual postage to one-balf the existing tes, and the reduction of postage with all other mines to and from which correspondence is nemitted in British mail or in closed ™»»i« through the United Kingdom. The Secretary of the Interior reports the dispo sition during the fiscal year of 4.629,000 acre« of * land, of which about 1,900,000 were entered under the Homestead act. He commends the homestead policy apd urges stringent provisions to secure the faithful application of railroad land grants to purposes designed by Congress, with a forfeiture ubiic debt Austria. i&to : _ tIm mt of the laud for violation *f the. conditions 1m posed. The Pacific railroads are heilig prosecuted with nnexampleifyigor, and he confidently anti cipates their completion before the expiration of the time fixed by Congress. . The entire number of pensioners is 126,700, a striking but melancholy proof of tbe; sacrifices made to maintain the integrity of the Union.,' It is estimated that $33,000,000 will be required for pensions. t •' ; •*:, - ' - *!•' He recommends legislation for the preservation of thé Mississippi levees and the.removal of ob at ructions tbdte navigation. He . suggests a law giving a deM^a e fh Congress to the District of Columbia, tlnrsame as* k T^rritoryT Foreign re lations are generally satisfactory.' He alludes to the suëcess of the Atlantic Cable as opening a new era of eivilizatign, and anticipates even greater results from t&äcompleüon of the RaSsnui American telegraph; He r&ieafsea particulars already known about the French agreement to .withdraw troops frugi, Mexico in three detachments, after Which France was to assume the attitude ér non-intervention in regard to Mexico, as held *y thè Government of the United States. These proceedings .were ex pected to produce a crisis or great .political inter est in Mexico, therefore on the 8th of November Minister Campbell was sent to assume'his proper functions near that government. It was also thought expedient that he be attended in the vi cinity of Mexico by Lt. Gen. Sherman, With the view of obtaining such information as might be important to determine the coarse to be pursued by the United States for re-establishing and main taining the necessary proper intercourse with the Republic of Mexico. Such was the condition of affairs when, on the 22d of November, official in formation was received from Faria that the Em peror had decided to postpone the withdrawal of à detachment, but promising that he would with draw the entire force next spring. Our govern ment promptly declared its dissent from this change of policy. It is hoped that France will reconsider and adopt some resolution regarding the evacuatipn, conforming, as nearly as practi cable, to the existing engagement. It is believed that after thé evaouation-of Mexico no subject for serions difference with France wjll exist. The expr e9a ions of the French Emperor, and people warrant the hope that the traditional friendship between the two countries^ might in that-case be renewed and permanently restored. With reference to the claims of American citi zens against France, the latter suggests a mutual convention for the. adjustment of the claims of citizens of both countries,growing out of the late wars on this continent. Tbe President, thinking this reasonable, refers it to (jon gi ess. No considerable advance- has been made towards the adjustment of differences between the United States and England, regarding Anglo-rebel priva teers and their depredations. The aelay was chiefly caused by the dogmatic situation ot England under the old ministry. Tpere is reason to believe that the new ministry Will consider such claims in a becoming and friendly »spirit. It is manifest that good wili and friendship between the two coun tries cannot be established until reciprocity in the practice of good faith and neutrality shall be re stored between the respective nations. The President recites the steps taken by the Government in June last to suppress the Fenian invasion of Canada. Representations have been ; made to the British Government, which, it is hoped, will iüduCe executive clemency towards the convicted Fenians and a judicious amnesty to all engaged. He indicates personal sympathy with those who desire to redress Irish wrongs, but insists that oar neutrality laws, however harsh, must be faithfully executed up til modified or re pealed. A mission to Greece is recommended. * - Referring to the claim, by European govern ments, of the right of militarf service from adopt ed A&erican citizens, the Presideut-.maintains the right, of voluntary expatriation, suggests Congres* sional assertion of the principle that naturaliza tion by a State fully exempts a native born subject of any other from performing military service un der any foreign government, sa long as he does not voluntarily renounce the rights and benefits or his adopted, nationality. The message closes thus: Our Government is now undergoing its most trying ordeal and my "earnest prayer is that the Government may be successfully and finally pre served without impairing its original strength and symmetry. The interests of the nation are best to be promoted by the' revival of fraternal rela tions, the complete obliteration of our past differ ences, and the reinauguration of all the pursuits of peace. Directing our efforts to the early ac complishment of these great ends, let us eudeavor to preserve harmony between the co-ordinate de partmonts of the Government, that each iii its proper sphere may cordially co-operate with the other in securing the maintenance of the Consti tution, the preservation of the Union, and the perpetuity of our free institutions Fine Goods.—I saacs Bros., corner of Main and Commereial^streets, offer a really very superfine assortment of ladies' dress and fancy goods, gents furnishing goods, clothing, and heavy and fine boots and ladies' shoes and gaiters, together with a choice stock of groceries, liquors and general merchandise, They never fail to give satisfaction. New Store—M. Wunsch & Co. have started a store on the west side of Main street, and have a very heavy stock* of fashionable and excellent winter clothing, heavy underclothing, furnishing goods, boots, hats, gloves, &c. Mr. Wunsch is a substantial and liberal merchant. He keeps the best qualities of goods, deals-honorably, and his prices are as low as can be expected. C. J. Bernstiel has'superb brandy and ohoicest whiskey; also finest champagne, port and other wines, in his great fire proof cellars, and in the general grocery and provision, clothing and dry goods line, everything needed in this community. His tobacco and cigars are unsurpassed. Bismark. —A letter by a late steamer from one of the most intelligent newspaper corres pondents in Europe, says of Bistnark's ambi tion: "Let me tell you tliat this ambition is of a magnitude which will be seen to fall but little short of that of the great Napoleon. His aim is that Germany united shall rule Europe.— He has annihilated Austria as a great power, and the next to fall must be France. If this Saxon question is to be the casas belli, let it be so. It is ground of bis own choosing, and be has chosen well, and asks bat for time.— And in the next conflict, with all Germany at his back, he means to settle both Franca and '• ? 

MISC LANËOUS. ■■m Gettiko Away—N u.mbep of miners dàjly through Walla WaUa on thèir way to Oregon a California, to pass tjhe winter season. - HkavS: License.—A hurdy gurdy bousnin Waila Walla pays a qutterly license of $1,000, and an other, to pay the same 8om,us ahout to open. Extekprisk.—T he Telegraph says a yodng man in Ogden Gity, Utah, designs.^uilfiing a small steamer for the wood and bffter trade on Great Sait Lake. More Telegjraph—A. project is on foot to ex tend tbe line of telegraph from Portland to Waila Walla. To continue it tbenèe on to Boise and Idaho cities will be a work of small time we hope. To be Hung—A t the late term of the Umatilla Circuit Court, Gregon, Fred. Brown was convicted of tbamarder of a Frenchman on-the Blue Moan tains last August, and sentenced to be hung Jan uai y 17th next. Earthquake.—A shock of earthquake was felt a,t Dalles City, Nov. 24th, aud continued half a minuté. Some conjecture that old Mount. Hood occasioned the commotion. He is big enough to shake a bigger town. It extended to CelRo. Complimentary.— The late employes of Ben. Holladajy's Ovérfand Mail and Express line are getting Hp a splendid punch bowl, ladle and gob Ipts, all of masiivA silver, to cost about $10,000, ara pfosent^ for Holla day, in token of their appre ciation of his kindness to them while in- his em fd-jy. 4 Gov. Weller's Lecture.A lie Vedette of the 7th<speaks ip high praise of a lecture delivered in Salt Lake City on the 5th, by Gov. Weller, on the Wreoual Reminiscences of Distinguished American Statesmen. Thè paper intimates that Got. Weller will go East , next year, and repeat the lecture there in the large cities. Shipwreck.— The English iron ship Coya, from Sydney, was totally wrecked, Nov. 24tb, about sixty miles south from San Francisco, while sail ing for that port, by gross carelessnes# of the master, Cajp t. Faige. Out of thirty souls On board, passeugecs and crew, onlj one passenger, the first mate, add one sailor, were saved. Something-Wrong.—T he Walla Walla States* nfim says the Federal Liquor Inspector charges ten cents per gallon for inspection in that city, while tne charge for similar servioe, in Dalles City is ouly one cent, and is Portland a half cent per iVikll/vn Te tr*A. I 1 .-1 - 1. a m. a I ) A'.. a. 1- . 1 • i I . gallon. It would be well for those directly juter ested, in this Territory, to see that the Inspector does not overcharge them. M * Another —N.8. Morse of Georgia, was one of the delegates to tbe late Loyal Southen Conven tion. The Boston Post eaya îie had to leave Con nectieut in 1861 on äcconpl of his secession sym pathies, and the Hartford Times confirms the fact, and adds that he is a native of that State, and always lived there until he ran away in 1861. A fine specimen of a "Loyal Southerner" is Morse, and Very like all the other delegates to the same Convention ' Rather Rough.— 1$ a civil case before Justice Lymaif of Owyhee, a few days ago, in which the litigants were Chinamen, only one white witness was called. He swore to a certain state of facts, and three Chinamen were then called who sever ally swore they would not believe the white wit ness on oath. Under the Civil Rights law, the bulk of testimony was against the white witness, and the jury found for the patty who impeached his evidence. New Route.—T he official report of the explor ation and measurement of a new route from the. Big Bend of the Truckee river to Owyhee, made by Lieut Col. Williamson, U. S. Top. Engineers has been published. It says there are good or fair camping plaees at easy distances all along the route, with grass and water plenty, and the total distance from the Big Bend to Ruby City is 322 miles—the shortest' route yet discovered, Tbe greatest altitude on the route is 6308 feet, at the Summit Pass, about fourteen miles this side ol Lake Winnemucca, Knotty.— The Radicals say, 1s t, The Southern States are divested of their Statehood, and their State authority is null and void, and must lemaip so until Congress restores them to Statehood. 2d, That until the Southern States ratify the amendments the Radicals propose to the Constitu tion, they shall hot be restored to Statehood. If they are not States they cannot ratify the amend meuts. Only a State can exercise that right, and if the Southern States should ratify while they are divested of their Statehood, tbe act would be null and void, agreeably to the logic of the Radi cals, and not at all binding on the States or the people of the whole Union. Take the Radicals at their word, and the South can never again be within the Union as States. Dread Rétribution. —During the war a Demo cratic editor in Dayton; Ohio, named BoIImeyer, was murdered by an Abolitionist, without any pro. vocation. An Abolition court tried and acquitted the murderer. The whole trial was a disgraceful farce, and all who participated in it were guilty of official perjury. Some three years have elapsed, and the County Clerk; the Sheriff, and about one half of the jury, are dead, while the infamous Judge, who outraged justice at tbe trial, is an idiot in a lunatic asylum ! Jim Lane, while his baud was yet smoking with the blood of murdered vic tims, was elected to thé office of United States Senator by a Puritanic Legislature. For one of bis murders he was tried and of course acquitted. He has fallen by his own halm. It is now believed by most of mankind, that Mrs- Surratt was guilt less of participation in the mnrder of Mr. Lincoln. When she was under sentence of death, after a trial which will be considered a blot on onr coun try and age, Mr. Preston Kihg prevented access to the President, and denied admission to her daughter, who almost shrieked.and sobbed her life away on ti\e steps of the Executive mansion. A few months afterwards, Preston King stilled a re morseful conscience in this world by self murder. Progressing.— The Supreme Cour^ of In diana has decided that the article in the Con stitution of that State, which prohibit^ ne groes from becoming citizens, is null' and roid. Any negro who lives iu tfie Stats six months is a citizen. * * im
