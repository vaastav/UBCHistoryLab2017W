RO. nniioi iipinn nr LUNlLUMUn ur I HKTJHAPTEB Mrs. Bradley a Prisoner in United States Jail. BODY OF VICTIM SENT HOME Hemains of the Former benator Kissed by His Slayer. LAW MUST TAKE ITS COTJBSE Presence of Mrs. Adams In This City ?Statement by Warden of Prison. Before being conveyed to jail Mrs. Bradley. the slayer of the former senator, was permitted to view his remains at the morgue, and the deep love she had borne the man in life was evidenced when she bowed over the death slab and implanted a kiss upon his cold lips. Mrs. Annie C. Adams, the mother of Maude Adams, the actress, who, it is said, caused the almost insane jealousy which prompted Mrs. Bradley, who claims she is the mother of Brown's two children, to fire the fatal shot, was in this city today and visited the undertaking establishment of Adolph J. Schippert, where she was permitted to gaze for the last time on the face of the late senator. Mrs. Adams was pressed for a statement, but positively declined to say anything concerning the case. or to deny or affirm the published statement that she was engaged to be married to deceased. Mr. A. E. L. I.eckie, who until this afternoon was of the counsel for Mrs. Bradley, however, gave it as his opinion that Mr. Brown was not engaged to Mrs. Adams. Body Placed Aboard Train. The remains of Arthur Brown were conveyed In a lone hearse, without any accompanying vehicles, to the Cth street passengrer station of the Pennsylvania railroad about ll:-?5 o'clock this morning. With the hearse was Mr. Adolph J. Schippert, who had prepared the body for the long journey to Salt Lake City. The casket was met at the depot by Max Brown, son of the deceased. and hi? sister. Miss Alice Brown, who will accompany the remains to Utah. The Interment will be at Salt I>ake City, but the time for the obsequies there had i)atarmina4 nn A I Lr the time of the departure of the train. Ther* val no unusual scene at the railroad station beyond tRe presence of a few morbid persons who Razed at the casket as it *as borne to the baggage car. Tlk? warden (?ald that Mrs. Bradley is quiet and apparently as unaffected as any prisoner ever received at the jail, and that she Is receiving just the same treatment given other prisoners at the United Rtates jail; no distinction is made in the treatment of those who are incarcerated there, tie they prince or pp.uper. Warden Harris also said that the physical condition of Mrs. Bradley appears to be very much weakened, and that fact in connection with the mental strain she has been under resulted in the Jail physician today prescribing for her a special diet.This change from the rather plain prison fare ! not unusual. It Is always prescribed in the cases of any prisoner similarly afflicted. The prisoner Is reported to be taking her condition philosophically, and she believes that when a jury of twelve men hear her story they will hesitate to condemn her action In shooting the man who she declares Is the father of two of her children arvd who spurned her when she appealed to him to marry her. The Jail officers smiled today when they r?od that Mrs. Bradley when first received at the jail was made to don "the prison ult." While the prisoners at the workbouse wear a distinctive uniform to prevent them from running away. It was pointed out that those in the jail are not required to put on convfct garb, but wear in the prison the clothing they were attired in when admitted to the Institution. Mrs. Annie C. Adams at 11:40 o'clock this morning visited the undertakers establishment, where she viewed the remains, as stated. She departed with the statement that she was going back to New York. It was stated today that it was the in tention to have started the body to Utah last night, but the son of the late senator learned thut the-re would be trouble in making the proper railroad connection at Chicago for Salt Duke City, so the start was deferred. At time. It was added, was II Mrs. Adtmi' mtemlon to accompany the funeral party toVtah. She is said to have l>cen visibly alTe<-lhl while here bccause of the demise of the late senator. Atorney Leckai Withdraws." Mr. A. B. L?. I.eckle today formally withdrew as counsel far Mrs. Bradley. Detective Helan has been detailed upon the case, and he went to New York last night, it Is stated, for the purpose of Interviewing Mrs. Adams. It was said at police headquarters this afternoon that no message has been received from him. Action by Grand Jury. It l- said to be probable that an Indictment may be returned against Mr>\ Brad ley in a few days by the grand jury, which Is now In si-salon. In view of ihe fact that the calendar Is tilled to April 1 next it la probable that Mrs. Bradley will remain in Jail for several months at least, unlets her attorneys arrange to have her case adViUi'xd on the doek.*t. Attorney Barley t>f Salt Lake City, who is on his way to this city, will confer with Mis. Bradley's Washington attorney* in the preparation of fctr defense, it is said. It is reported that Max Brown, the son of the lute senator, said before his depar: ure for Salt l.ike City this afternoon with the remains, that he would carry out Ills father's expressed wish that Mrs. Bradley ihruid he prosecuted fully. In that connection it is said that a defense fund Is Iirlnir ru It* ?.imnn? **~4 - ? * - .?wv.. .? ? vuii Mutmg inr 11 iCIIUS of the woman to provide for her Interests before the local courts, and that steps have been taken to caro for h"?r four children. Mr*. Bradley Kissed the Body. Wlicu counsel for Mrs. Bradley made an effort to have their client remain at the house of detention yesterday morning Instead of going to the morgue they Maid they made tin* request because of her nervous condition. "I ran see no reason why the course In th'.s riu. should be any different from that pursued In other oases of the kind," said the coroner.

ALL OOICTII FRANCE i First Day of Church Separation I Without Disorder. PUBLIC INTEREST FLAGGING I Cardinal Richard Awaiting Expulsion ] From the Episcopal Mansion. . GOVERNMENT NOT USING FORCE ] Socialist Organ Hakes an Attack on ^ Government?Interesting Expedients May Be Resorted To. PARTS. December 14.?The first day of ( the regime of the separation of church j and state having: passed without grave dis- ( orders, public interest in the details of the continuation of the struggle is already visi- , bly flagging. It is now apparent that the re sisfeiK-o of the clergy will he purely passive , and that there is no prospect of religious j (jaroinai aicuaroi, . Bishop of r*rl?. f passions being aroused unless the churches I are closed, and the government, therefore, is resting on its oars and will continue to do so until parliament euthorixes the drastic .t measures which the cabinet is preparing. a In the meantime !n this city, except in the churches where legal applications were filed, the police again took notes of infractions of the law at the mcrning masses. Awaiting Expulsion. Cardinal Richard Is awaking expulsion from the episcopal mansion. The government, however, desires to -avoid even the appearance of force in the case of the aged primate, who U in bad health, and is postponing action in the hope that he will depart in a-few days of his own volition. The Action, a violent socialist organ, today made an attack on the government, calling attention to the alk_ -d fact that the Catholic gymnastic societies had numbers of rifles. There i<? not the slightest evidence, however, that armed resistence is contemplated. tj nn Toenail Po vrlo SjK( ln 1 ral lpgrim to The Star. PARIS, December 14.?Interesting expedients may be resorted to under the various laws and regulations here as to worship and the rulings of the pope and prelates. For example, Mgr. Pechenard, rector of the Catholic Institute of Paris, has adopted one. In connection with the Institute, as its chapel, Is the Church de Carraea, where the services heretofore have been public. Mgr. Pechenard hS? notified the commissary of police that the services hereafter will be private, as Is permissible under the terms of Minister Brland's circular. Mgr. Peche- , nard has Issued cards to certain persons, whose names and addresses appear on ' them. 1 Without one of these cards no one here- j after will be admitted to any service. The s doors will be closed when the hour for services comes and will toe guarded by at- ' Xendants pledged not to leave their post ' during the service and to admit none with- J out a card. Mgr. Pechenard explains that j he iirlnMnal obteet of the institute bcinir ' for higher Instruction anil the chapel being only accessory, he cannot afford to compromise its chief Interest and Its legal regularity by essaying anything forbidden by law. and he is unable under the pope's order to declare the services public assemblies. therefore the only course open to him Is the one lie has taken. The cards will be valid for one jear. Action of the Cabinet. PARIS. December 14.?The cabinet met today, with President Kallleres In the chair, in order to decide upon the new legislation to be presented to parliament, but the text of the measures decided upon will not be ready until tomorrow. The steps to be taken are of a very sweeping character. It is proposed to amend the law of 1905, providing for the separation of church and state, by which a year's grace was allowed before the permanent alienation of the church property, and to euDDresn the privilege of forming new cul tural or diocesan association* during that * period, and all church property. Including the neminarles. will be immediately handed over to the state, to the departments and to the commune*, under conditions insuring that the churches themselves will be retained for religious uaes. Conditions of Forfait. The continuance of public worship will be provided for under a combination of the laws of 1881 and 1801. With regard to the pensions and allowances of the clergy distinctions will be made by which those who are entitled to the former will lose their rights If they are deprived of their French citlsenshlj). while those who are entitled to the latter will lose their allowances if they do not conform with the law. The conditions under which the M*>rirv will forfeit their French cltisensliin * wllfiH, drawn up In a special measure, to j be prepared later. I Ira Godfrey Dead. NEW

Alt TIES MAY BE DIVIDED f. h 1 i! Elopes and Fears of Both Sides?Sub- [ ject May Be Loaded With Dynamite. h ti ' b "Does the administration's new policy 11 )f centralization cf federal power, an- s lounced by Secretary Root, 111! our long'elt want and furnish the democratic p >arty with an issue?" This is the ques- n :ion democratic statesmen and politicians ti ire asking each other with great eager- a less and a pronounced reviving of drcopng spirits. Those politicians who have felt that the democratic party has kept o is a kind of standing "Want ad." its de- 1Tinnrt fnr an issup arp savlna- th.if- Krrrp :ary Root's pronunciamento o-f the admin- s stratlon's attitude has perhaps furnished b in answer. p The democratic politicians profess to see 8 inbounded possibilities in the new issue. ' rhey s.iy It is neither a sectional nor a ^ lass issue, and that It will appeal as a ogently in the north as in the south; in n conservative New England as In rash and iasty California, and to the wealthy as u o the poor. n The immediate challenge which Secre- p .ary Root's announcement met with In t 'few York has aroused the hope "almost e >eyond the dreams of avarice" that the w iemocratic party may enlist in its cause ii igainst centralization the moneyed men s vho have heretofore cast in their lot?and >urses?with the republicans. It has also luggested to those democrats who have I imarted under the st'ng of populism, Sryanism and radicalism applied to the lemocracy in the past decade, that in the 'uture democracy may be the synonym for g iOnservatism. Another Alluring Prospect. The prospect of the possibility of dlvertng fo the democracy in its new position as he conservator of the Constitution that x>rtion of the republican vote which may C >e apprehensive of President Roosevelt's c jrogresslveness Is also alluring. Democrats j, enow that there is an Influential and conitantly growing element In the republican 1 >arty which Is fearful of the President's a apid progress in unfolding new plans for xtension of federal power and supervision. Democrats in Congress axe well, a wan: of t he feeling existing in considerate decree imong republicans in both House and Hen- > ite resentful of alleged encroachment of t iic cAcuutive upon xne legislative power, riiey know that the feeling is suppressed, oyalty to the head of the party deterring tl 'ree expression^? It. but they realize also hat It is just a question of time when the itorm will break in one house or the other, . ind democrats look for Immediate responso J 'rom the country to the protest which vould thus be voiced. Democrats say that b his sentiment will merge with the sentlnent of opposition to centralization, and lr hat the creation of a spirit of opposition to _ he republican party is inevitable, and by c vhich the democracy will proflt. The belief is universal In Congress that d Secretary Root voiced the President's opin- ^ ons in his New York speech. They assume hat the President chose Secretary Root as lis mouthpiece. In order to "put out a eeler," but have no doubt that he thor- si >lichlV inHnrcoo oil * ' ' -o?^ ?u mo occicuny saia, ana | t hat the announcement correctly defines he attitude of the Roosevelt admlnistra- 11 ion and the Roosevelt policies. 1 Republican senators and representative* ire chary about expressing for publication / heir views upon the new policy. There are V >bvious reasons for their hesitancy. They iislike, In what is yet merely academic liscusslon, to take Issue with the executive ind disclose disagreement In the party. 1 But In private conversation they do not lesltate to taHs freely, and while the issue s not yet sharply enough defined to line up 'actions, remarks of leading republicans in Kith houses sbow the existence of strong 'eellng not in harmony with the adminis.ration's policy, a* declared by Secretary j Ftoot. .

Republicans say the subject is loaded * irith dynamite, politically, and ttiat Is anither reason why they are cautious in their * tuuiic uLieraiiceB. iney realise me possiDiitles of aemoeratic advantage In an Issue such as this could be distorted into by clev r politicians. They hope, however, that the I lomocrats may be put in tiie attitude otf reviving the old states rights Question, and f this new policy can be exploited as mere- S y a rebuttal of that theory the situation will be relieved of some of Its menace to he republicans. e Of course there Is an element In Congress a which Is entirely in accord with the admin- f stratlon's latent attitude. This is the mill- c ant, younger faction, which idolizes Roosei-elt and attaches the name of Rooseveltism lo everything which they declare to be pro- ' jressive and aggressive. They are impatient ii with old conditions and seise eagerly upon s he idea that the growth of the nation warrants changes. They look to President t Ftoosevelt to set the pace. * Representative Lacey of Iowa, one of the d >lder republicans of the House, and re- t parHwl ran ? pnnsprvnMvp. SflM* ? "While it is true that a demand for congressional action often and most commonly rrows out of the neglect of some states to P lo that which they ought to do.

However, I have not read t he Secretary's speech with sufficient care I 0 discuss It at length, and the opinion p uhlch I have Just offered is only upon the >road and general proposition." f 8ay It Will Be the Issue. * Representative Livingston of Georgia, the m an king democrat of the appropriations sommittee, and regarded as one of the dam- , eratic leaders of the House, said: I "I am glad that Secretary Root had the sourage to declare a policy long In practioe jy the republican party ? centralisation, for years that party has been, by legislate action, encroaching upon the reserved lghts of the states, and has attempted to excuse action on the ground of expediency, eavlng the Impression that it would not be 1 fixed policy.

Aa \ matter of fact, I haven't been able to find the time to read Mr. Root's apeeoh with peat care, but I have no hesitation In itat>ng that I have a very decided opinion that he tendency toward the centralisation of ederal power should be checked rather han encouraged.

CHAMP CLARK'S STATEMENT Author of Provision Giving Bight of Trial Before Dismissal. LAW HAS BEEN VIOLATED In Cardozo Case and Other Cases Acted on?Representative Olcott and Others Agree. ? There will probably be quick action by the House District committee on the biM introduced yesterday by Representative Green of Massachusetts to define the position of teachers in the public school system of Washington. The committee is practical ly a unit in me belief that the superintendent of schools and the board of education had repeatedly violated the spirit and intent, if not the letter, of the law passed at the last session of Congress, and it is their intention to straighten matters out before the close of the present session. Representative Champ Clark of Missouri, an ex-schoo> teacher and the man who for several sessions of Congress prior to the passage of the ne-' law spoke and worked for the teachers of Washington, said touay to a Star reporter that in his opinion the new law had been flagrantly violated. Mr. Clark was the author of that portion of the new law which pr.ovides that all teachers in the local system shall have the privlivge of trial and representation by counsel before dismissal. He secured the insertion of this paragraph when the bill was before the House last session. Mr. Clark's Statement. "That paragraph of mine was Inserted in the law by the Hou3e to prevent Just such action as was taken by the superintendent rind lioard of education in the Cardoso case, and other cases upon which action has been had. The Intent of the law was to cover all classes of employes. It doesn't make any difference whether it Is a teacher or a principal, the spirit of the iaw was to give a fair trial and hearing to the accused person, or the person wuh whom dissatisfaction was felt, before action was taken on their case. There has been plain and open violation of the spirit and intent of ihe law certainly, and I think that the letter of the law has been violated as well. I am very glad, indeed, that Representative Green of Massachusetts, who was a member of ; the subcommittee on schools and who knows, as do the rest of us, just what the law wrifl Intended to do, just what it meaas, and just how it should be carried put, has Introduced a bill upon which hearing In ; the way of Inquiry can be had, and which, i when passed, will straighten matters out and force the local school authorities to obey the statutes In Intent and spirit, as Tvoll n_s in letter." Mr. Clark said he was very anxious to see action ofi the bill at once, and when It grot before the House would do what ue could to help it along. Mr. Olcott's Views. Representative Olcott of New York, who was also a member of the school subcommittee, took about the same view of the situation. "I have not gone over the Green bill very carefully," said Mr. Olcott, "but from what I understand I think it is a very admirable measure. Certainly something must be done without delay. The Intent of the law is very plain. It is likewise just as plain that the intent of the law has been violated by the superintendent of schools and by the board of education. It was certainly the intent of tha makers of that law, as I am in a position to know, to make it Imperative upon the local authorities in the schools here to give every teacher a fair and square hearing before dismissal. That has not been done. I certainly should have taken some action in the matter myself had not Representative Green introduced his bin. But the authorship of a measure is nothing to me so long as it can accomplish the end In view, and <o. believing Mr. Green's bill to be very timely and to'be directed toward the Accomplishment of an admirable purpose, I shall support it heartily. "I don't think any long drawn out hearing on the bill will be necessary. We had enough and even too much of that at the last session of Congress, when the measure which Is the present law was In process of formation. Mr. Green will have no trouble, however, in getting all the hearings he thinks may be necessary upon his bill before the House District committee, and I don't think there will be any trouble either about its practically unanimous passage when it comes before the House. "The school question wag not only discussed at length last year, not only in committee but on the floor of the House, and a great many members were interested, some in a disinterested way, some in an academic way, others personally, others sentimentally. So a large proportion of the membership of the House is familiar with the law, its purpose, spirit and intent, and when the facts are presented to them will be able to see very readily that the spirit they intended has been violated. So action should bo easy, and I think it will be a good thing for everybody concerned if this everlasting muddle was cleared up for good and all." General Sentiment. These views Indicate what appears to be the general sentiment of members of Congress who had anything to do, directly or Indirectly, with the passage of the school law upon this subject. The District commlttee has not fixed a day for hearing on the Green bill, and it is probable that not too much time will be devoted to its consideration unless Representative Green should insist upon an extended inquiry, which is possible. But it is probable the btU could he favorably reported by the District committee without any hearing at ail. This, it la understood, would be contrary to Mr. Green's desires, however, as be believes that some good may be done by having the committee bring the members of the board of education and the superintendent of schools before it and asking them to explain some of their actions in the pasaage of the new law. * 

DROPPED FROM THE BILL. Proviaion Relating to Simplified Spelling. What probably will be the laBt act of the House of Representatives on the subject of simplified spelling occurred today, when, on motion of Representative Tawney, chairman of the committee on appropriation, the House without debate or division struck oat of the legislative, executive and Judicial bill the provision relative to spelling. The action was taken because of the promise of the President to revoke his order to the public printer and the consequent adoption of yesterday's resolution ob this subject.

NEW YORK, December 14.?A dynamite bomb with a time fuse attached was set olt In the hallway of the double-decker tenement at 502 1st avenue early this morning and the violence of the explosion caused an outpouring of the twelve families in the building.

One of these stores is that of Ciro Divano, a groceryman, who, with his wife and children. ranging in age from one year to eight, occupies rooms in the rear of his place of business. Divano had been picked out as a mark by the "Black Hand." The inevitable letters couched in the usual Black Hand style had been received by the groceryman.

Divano's bed room is reached through a door in the rear of the hallway, the same door opening Into the rear of the store. Some one slipped into the rear of the hallway from the street In the early hours 1 and placing the bomb near the doorway put I a match to the time fuse. The police came ] to the conclusion that it was dynamite that . had been used, as dynamite follows the line of greater resistance, and that was what 1 happened in this Instance. A hole a foot square yawning into the cellar was ripped In the hallway and the 1 door was blown Into splinters, many of ' which fell on the bed where the grocer 1 slept with his wife. \ NO DECISION BEACHED. J Committee Will Vote on Ship Sub- < sidles January 7. t No decision as to the committee's attitude 1 on ship subsidy was reached at the caucus : of the republican members of the House j committee on merchant marine and fisher- I ies held today. After discussing the amend- c ed Galilnger bill, the republicans took no action, but decided to call a meeting of the committee for January 7, when a vote of the entire committee will be taken on the measure. The amendments to the bill drafted by Representative Grosvenor eliminate cargo subsidy entirely and limit the government's aid to mail-carrying shl^s to 8outh America and the Orient. Even with these changes the members of the committee from the middle west do not favor the measure. WILL UKGE SHIP SUBSIDY. The President to Send a Message to Congress.

SPEAKER'S PAY RAISED If ore Compensation Voted to the Cabinet $12,000 FOR VICE PRESIDENT Lively Debate Over the Attempt U fU? ?r a- ? urn aui d ui n>epre* , sentatives. The great question of congressional snl? irles came up In the House this afternooa a. little before 2 o'clock, and It wasn't long ?efore the word had been passed that thera might be something doing along this lino, and every member was in his seat. Representative Ijittauer of New York, who will retire from Congress at the end of the present session, started the ball rolling by his proposition to increase the salaries of tha Vice President and the Speaker of tha House to $12,000 per year. This went through like a greased pig. Tha proposition to Increase the salaries of tha members of the cab.net to $12 000 followed suit in no time. Then came the proposition to boost si-iiltors, representatives and delegates In Cougi-ess from $5,000 io $7,.VI a year, and to rut out mileage, leaving members to draw merely their actual traveling expenses traveling to and from sessions of Congress. Early In the discussion Representative Butler of Pennsylvania offered an amendment to the Littauer proposition to make tne salaries to go into effect with th? 3ixty-tirst Congress. I'pon this proposition Representative 1'nderwood of Alabama alked for five minute*, hut as every other rongrpspman was talking to his neighbor it the same time the official stenographer s the only one who knows what Mr. I'nlerwood had to say. He has several times n the past, however, expressed his opposi;ion to a salary increase for members. His constituents went pat on that line of conversation. Mr. Boutell Opposed. Representative Boutell of Illinois, a promtlent figure on she republican side, was leard with more attention. Mr. Boutell op503rd the proposition. He thought that to ncrease the compensation of a member of Congress would mean to decrease the honor >f service in the national legislature. "This House is the greatest legislative iody that ever assembled in the history >f thf world." declared !"r. Boutell. "Memi^rahip la this House Is the greatest honor Lhat (an possibly be conferred b> aa ilecfacato. ii aiiuuiu uc con^raerea a* su<*n a ureal honor that the comp'.nsatioii should bu merely a secondary consideration. I say that in attempting to make membership In this House adequately compensated you necessarily diminish th? honor of service. Many members would make an effort to ?ome here if t"hey received no compensation at all. I personally know many of them who have renounced a great deal nore than fT.GOO a year in order to secure ind retain their seat in this great body. "As hard as I find it to get along on my present salary of $5,000. I would make an pffort even to the point of beggarly economy to retain my seat in the House if every ^ent of compensation were to be cut off."' Favors the Increase. Representative Clark of Florida, a democrat, made an impassioned and eloquent appeal to the House to forsake its usual hypocrisy and come out for the Increase. He urged It to look at the matter from a practical standpoint aud from the standpoint of right and Justice. "Are these salaries adequate?" he asked. 'You know they are not! I know they are lot. They should certainly be Increased if inly from the standpoint of the duties a member has to perform. I come from * ilstrlct that I know will stand by me when 1 vote to increase salaries of members of Congress. My people are In favor of decent jay. The government of the United States jught not to require services without adequate compensation. "Not one of uh but In private conversaion will admit that $5,000 a year is not an idequate compensation. I Intend to vote oil his and every other proposition that comes tp as long as I am here that I think right, t Is Impossible to maintain an average amlly In Washington, with all expenses onsidered, on S-ViOrt a year. "And I wouldn't come to Congress even is a senator for a long session of seven op ;ight or nine months and be forced because of the Inadequate pay to leave the vife of njy bosom and the children of my leart behind me. What Is more. If It 1? j ight to have these salaries increased from Uarch 4, It Is right to have them in- I reaaed from 11107. "I Intend If the amendment of Representative Butler of Pennsylvania is vote<t town to offer an amendment making the ncrease go into effect with the next session ot Congress. "You cannot deceive the American peo>le by subterfuge, although some gentienen think they can and will try. They will vote against this proposition, hoping o God that It will pass just the same." Wouldn't Increase Expense. Representative Livingston of Georgia, a nember of the appropriations committee, :alled the attention of members to the fact hat the proposed Increase to I7.90O, with he elimination of mileage and the gi*bstiution of actual expenses of members In ittendlng sessions would not call for any no re money to be expended from the trea*iry than is now paid out on the $3,?K> >asis. Representative Sullivan of MaamchucetM irgred the passage of the increase propuItton. Referring to the house of commons, the nembers of which receive no aalaries, Mr. luiuvan auia uiai mis n?a resulted in the onstltuencies of men}- patriotic Irishmen >elng compelled to contribute for their suport. If salaries were not Increased Mr. Sulllan insisted that In a f?w years there rould be but two classes of men in th* ioiuse?idle rich and professional politicians -both equaHy objectionable. Representative Simms of Tennessee ofered an amendment making the Increase lfectlve In 1UU7. Representative Gaines said he had a leter from Senator Tillman saying that If his alary wasn't raised he would starve to ieath. Who would want to cause poor Senator oilman to starve?" cried Mr. Simms, raisng Ms hands in mock horror. Gen. Grosvenor of Ohio spoke of the Inrease as absolutely Justified by present ondttlons In tbe country. Renresentatlve Jones of Washington in rod ured a bill providing for an Increase of 0 per cent In the salaries of all employes f the government. Shah's Condition Critical.
