The message which President ! Wilson delivered in Congress last j week lias attracted more atten- ' tion than any other message to ) Congress during the last thirty j years. It is admitted bv all that the j state papers of President Wilson : rank very high, but none of the others equal the last one in the epoch making events which it in augurated. From every location the great swelling j , chorus of approval is wider and louder; for the coun- j s try realizes now as newer before! that the vast and unlimited ! wealth of this great country is no "longer safe" without ade-! quate defense. The American idea of prepar-(y° edness is to be a citizenry trained i to arms so that if we are attack- j 1, as some of the nation of Eu e< rope has been attacked, we will be ready to meet the aggressor with trained men. President Wilson! I is acting on the same principle asi anv eitv, which organizes a police i tr 1 1 and fire department for the pro tection of life and propertv. The part of President Wilson's methods which flays the al citizens" that is the hyphenat-j ^ ed variefv, was most warmly ap- ! plauded by Congress. There is 1 an urgent necessitv for a law mak- j^ ing it an "net of treason" for ' any one to injure the industries j of* this country with a view of, conferring any kind of benefit on I a foreign country. Congress will j undoubtedly pass a law so dras- j tic that the hyphenated citizens ; which have been abusing their ! privileges in this country will be j shot in the future and their prop-'Get ertv confiscated if anv more a--1 tivitVis indulged in resulting in j of or aiming at violence of any sort, 1 for the benefit of a foreign nation. !

Perhaps the fault lies with the wallpaper. It is pointed out by Prof. Syiyanus Thomp> son,-principal of the City Technical college, London, that much light is wasted owing to the use on our walls of paper which absorbs an unduly large proportion of light Before we can look for anything like a sufficient return for the monoy we spend on light, all the rich dark tones, the deep crimson, which is so popular for dining rooms on account of the impression of warmth it gives, and the various shades of brown so much used in libraries and dens, must be replaced by pure white or very light shades which absorb a minimum of light Even when the Illumination of a room is ample, it may be badly lit if the walls absorb too much of that il* lumination instead of giving it back by diffuse reflection. Few people are aware how much light is thus wasted and thrown away. The deep scarlet and crimson wall* papers waste from 70 to 75 per cent; brown paper wastes about 85 to 8f? per cent; even an ordinary yellow or buff wallpaper wastes 50 to 60 per cent of the light for which in most cases, a high price is paid. On the other hand, white cartridge paper ab sorbs and wastes only about 20 per cent of the light, while a white-washed wall absorbs 30 to 40 per cent Prof. Thompson strongly recom mends that, both for economy in arti ficial lighting and comfort in the day light lighting of large rooms, the ceil ings should be invariably white, and the walls, if not white, should at least be of the very palest tints.
