While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past yeur K-cii eutinMy free from jvcn'lexi^y. no emharrassix situ ations remain that will not yield to the spir it of fairness and love which characterise a truly American f«*rdgu j*oli«*y. Of the outbreak iu Uraril the president says: The struggle is between the estab lished govirnmvtiT. wldeh patrols the ma chinery of administration, and with which we maintain friendly relations, ami certain officers of the navy employing the vessels of their command in an attack upon the uatiutial capital and chief seaport, and lacking, as it does, the elements of divided administration. 1 have fait«*d to see that the insurgeuts can reasonably claim rec ognition as lieligerents. Thus far the intui tion of our government has been that of an attentive but Impartial observer of the nu Jjrtumite conflict. The questions attesting our relations with Great Itritaln have l»een treated in a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations are iu progress i»etweeu the two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the award and regulations agreed upon by the Itertug sea tribunal of arbitration practi cally effective, and it is not doubted that Great ltritaln will co-operate freely with this country for the accomplishment of that purpose. The dispute growing out of the documentary tolls imposed in the Welland canal upon cargoe* of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the Vuited States was adjusted by the substitu tion of a more equitable sehcdule of charges, and my predecessor thereupon sus pended his proclamation imposing discrim inating tolls upon llrltish transit through our canaN. A ropiest for additions to the list of extraditable offcuses covered by the existing treaty between the two countries \i under consideration. A "special llawnilnn Mfsnnce. It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our rela tions with Hawaii have caused serious em barrassment. Just prior to the installment of the pres ent administration the existing government of Hawaii had been suddeuly overthrown and a treatv of annexation had been ne gotiated between the provisional govern ment of the islands and the l.'nited States aud submitted to the senate for ratiilcatlon. This treaty 1 withdrew for examination, aud dispatched lion. James !!. lllount of Georgia to Honolulu as a special commis sioner to make an impartial investigation of the circumstances attending the change of government and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough ami exhaustive examina tion Mr. Mount submitted to me his re port. showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government and through the Intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States, which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed. It seetned to me the only honorable course for our govern ment to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been beeu done by those representing us, and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible Intervention. "With a view of accomplish ing this resu't within the constitutional limit of executive power and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities grow ing out of any changed condition brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instuctlons to that end. Thus far no information of the accomplishment of any definite results has been received. When received they will be promptly sent to congress, together with all other informa tion at hand, accompanied by a special ex ecutive message fully detalllug all the facts necessary to a complete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all the material events leading up to the present situation.

The report of the secretary of the navy contains a history of the operations of his department during the past year and ex hibits a most gratifying condition of the personnel of our navy. lie presents a satisfactory account of the progress which had been inaile in the construction of ves sels and makes a number of recommenda tions to which attention is specially In vited. During the past six months the de mauds for cruising vessels have been many ami urgent. There have been revolutions, calling for vessels to protect Ameri can Interests in Nicaragua. i«nutemala, Costa Kica. Honduras, Argentina and Urn ill, while Ihe condition of alTairs In Hono lulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. With all these calls upon our navy it became necessary, In or der to make up a suOident fleet to patrol the Uerlng sea under the modus \ivendl agreed upon with Orcat Uri'.ain. to detail to that service one vessel from the tisli commission and three from the revenue ma rine. The following vessels of the new navy have been complete.) and are now ready for service: The double turr« ted e.»ast de fense monitor Mianlonoutoh. the double turreted coast defense monitor Monterey, the armored cruiser New York, the pro tected cruisers UaMhnore, 'h tea go.

The report of the secretary of agriculture will be found exceedingly Interesting, es pecially to that larae part of our citizens intimately concerned In the agricultural oc cupation. On the 7th day of M-reh, IS'3. there was upon Its pay rolls 2.1-'o employes. This number has bec»»n reduced to J.s."o per sons. In view of a depleted pubP.c treasury aud the lmperntlve.demand of people for ecouomv In the adnffnlstratlon of their gov ernment. the secretary has entered upon the task of rationally reducing expenditures by tlie elimination from the pay rolls of all persons not needed for an efficient conduct of the affairs of the department. During the first quarter of the present year the ex penses of the department aggregated $34.», 070.70, as against *4'»2,021.42 for the corre sponding period of the fiscal year, ending June .30, 1803. The secretary .ipakcs appar­ "•3*3'?8'*£T-t' T"' ent his intention to continue tuts rate Of re duction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by 2fcn*4.20 thau those for the present year. The amount of the appropriation for the bureau of animal industry for the current fiscal year is The estimate for the ensuing year is $7«"0.«HX. The regulations of INC concerning Texas fever have been en forc^n! during the last year, aud the large st«H'k yards of the country have been kept free from iufection. The total numlter of ins|eotlons of cattle for exp.irt durlug the past fiscal year was 011.M2. The ex|»orts show a falling off of about 25 ier vnt from the prec*Mling year, the decrease occurring entirely in the last half of the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely due to an increase iu the prb-e of American exi»ort cattle during the year endlug'June 30. 1!*3. Kxports of inspected pork aggregated 20. 077.410 pounds, as against :. lo2.S74 pounds for the preceding year. The falliug off in this export was uot confined, however, to Inspected pork, the total quantity exported iu tc*2 being GG5.4Po.6l6 pounds, while in lye it was only e27.3t*v0iC» ikuuhIs. The exports of agricultural products from the Vuited States for the fiscal year ending June 3o. isi»2. attaltUMl the enormous fig ure of $soo.ttXU\»o in rvund utitubers. being 7.7 per ceut of our total exports. Iu the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but. nevertheless, reached $6lo. beiug 75.1 per cent of all American commodities exported. A review of our agricultural exports with special reference to their destination, will show* that in al most every line the United Kingdom of Great Uritian and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion, of cattle, the total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1S»3. $26.0uMH)o, of which Great Uritian took considerably over $25.i^«o.Of beef products of all kinds, our total exports were $2S.th*.»HK*, of which Great Uritian took $24,«*m.um. of pork products the total exports were s^t.tHto.oOo, of which Great Uritian took $53.ih*MM0. in bread stuffs, cotton and minor products of like proportions sent to the same desti nation are shown. In the vear ivto the congress appropri ated Sl.Om. to be taken from the patent office funds, for the purpose of collecting ami distributing rare and Improved varie ties of seeds and for prosecuting agricult ural investigations and procuring agricult ural statistics. From this small beginning the seed division of the department of ag riculture has arowu to its present unwieldy and unjustifiable extravagant proportion*. During tlie last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was 

SOG.54S.01. The reinaiuder of an appropriation of $135,000 was ex pembsl In putting them up and distributing them. in each state and territory an agricultural exik'rimem statiou has been established. These stations, by their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds, and yet this indiscriminate and wasteful dis tribution by legislation and legislator con tinues. answering no purpose unless It 1k» to remind constituents that their representa tives are willing to remember them with gratuities at nubile cost. Civil Service Reform. Tlie continued Intelligent execution of the civil service law and the increasing ap proval bv the people of Its operation are inest gratifving. The recent extension of Its limitation and regulations to the em ploves at the free delivery postotlices, which Ins been honestly and promptly accom plished by tin* commission by the hearty eo-oporaiion of the |Hstmaster general, is an immensely important advauce in the use ft Itiess of the system. I am. If possible, more than ever con vinced of the Incalculable benefits conferred by the dvil service law, not only in its ciTect upon the public service, but also, what Is even mote inqortant, in its effect in elevating tlie tone of political life gen rally. Since issi» congress has at each session authorized the building of one or more ves isels, and the secretary of the navy pre sents an earnest plea for the continuance of this plan. He recommends the authori zation of at least one battleship aud six torpedo boats. While I am distinctly In favor of consistently pursuing the policy we have Inaugurated In building up a thor ough and ctlicicnt navy, 1 can not refrain from the suggestion that the congress should carefully take Into account the num ber of unfinished vessels on our hands and tlie deplored condition of our treasury Iu considering tie: propriety of an appropria tion at this time to begin new work. Tlie Pension lliirean. On the 30th day of June. 1S03, there were on the pension rolls 066,012 names, an in crease of ssi,014 over the number on the rolls June 3o, 1*02. Of these there were hc\cntecn widow* and daughters of revolu­ tionary soldiers, 80 survivors of the war of 1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors and widows of the Mexican war, 3.HS2 survivors ami widows of Indian wars. 2S4 army nurses and 475,645 survivors aud widows and children of deceased soldiers and suitors of the War of the Ite bcllllon. The latter number represents those pensioned on account of disabilities or death resulting from army and uavy service. The number of persons remaining oil the rolls June 30, 1S03, who were pen sioned under the act of June 27, 1800, which Include also pensions on account of death and disabilities not chargeable to army service, was 450.555. The number added to the rolls during the year was 123, o:M, and the number dropped was 33.000. The first payments on pensions allowed dur ing the year amounted to $33,570,540.08. This Includes arrears or the accumulation between ihe time from which the allowance of the pension dates and the time of act ually granting the certificate. Although the law of isoo permits pensions for disa bilities now related to military service, yet as a requisite to Its benefit a disability must exist in incapacitating applicants ••from the performance of manual labor to Mu a degree as to render them unable to of this law In Its early stages does not seem to have beeu In accord with its true Intention, but os.- ino last administration an authoritativ construction was given to '.to statute, .iud since that time this con struction has been followed, 'Phis litis had the effect of limiting tin? operations of the law Io Its intended purpose.

I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoro»ighn.'«s and vlger, Kv ery name fraudulently put nnor. these rolls Is a wicked Imposition upon the kindly sen timent In which pensions have their orign.

Tariff Reform Economy in public -xpenditure is a duty that cannot, innocently be neglected by those entrusted with the control of money drawn from the people for public uses. It must be confessed that our apparently endless resources, 'he familiarity of our peop'o with immense necumti! it lorn: of wealth tlie growing sentiment among them that the expendliure of public nnwy should iu some manner be to their immedi ate and 'rsonal advantage the Indirect ml almost stealthy manner in which a large part of our taxes are exacted, and a degenerated sense of official accountability have led to growing extravagance in gov ernmental appropriations. The duty of public economy Is also of Immense importance In Its Intimate and ricccssnry relation to the task now In hand of providing revenue to meet government expenditure and yet reducing the people's burden of crate taxation. After hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us. Nothing so Important claims our atten tion and nothing so clearly presents Itself as both an opportunity aud a duty—an op portunity to observe the gratitude of our fellow citizens, a duty Imposed upon us by our oft-repeated professions and by the emphatic mandate of the people. A*ter full discussion, our countrymen have spoken in favor of this reform, and they have con fided the work of Its uccompllslnncnt to the hands of those who are solemuiy pledged to It. If there is anything In the theory of a rep Gsentution In public pluces of the people aud their desires, If public officers are really the servants of the people, and If political promises and professions have any binding force, our failure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing ghould interfere to distract our attention or DICKINSON.

These gifts should be the willing Inuiefactlons of a gov ernnuut whoso higher function is the pro nmttiln Af tha n.k.knl. nUM3*. xv.» .. motion of the people." Not- ies's 'closely''re^ people's prosiH'rity and'well luted to our r» |uosj»vriiv ami wen being is the removal of the restrictions upon the importation of the raw materials ntsvssary to our manufacturers. The world would Ik* open to our Ingenuity and enterprise. This eaunot he while fedral legislation through the imposition of high tarln forbids to American manufacturers as cheap material as those used bv their compe titors. It Is quite obvious that the enhance ment of the price of our manufactured pro ducts resulting from this pollov not only confines the market for these products with in our own borders to the direct disadvan tage of our manufacturers, but also In creases their cost to our citizens. The Inter ests of labor are certainly, though Indirect ly. Involved In this feature of our tariff system. The sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturers to suppiv the limited demand for their goods, soon fli| the narrow market to which they are con hned. Then follows a suspension of work in mills ami factories a discharge of emploves and distress la the homes of our working- ven if the often disproved assertion could be made good, that a lower rate of wages would result front free raw material and low tariff, does the Intelligence of our workingmen lead them quickly to discover that their steady employment permitted bv free raw material Is the most iui|vortant factor In their relation to tariff legislation. A measure has been prepared bv the ap propriate congressional committee etuobdy ing tariff reform on the lines .icreiu sug gested. which will be protuntlv Kuhmittcd for legislative action It Is the result of much patriotic and unsdflsh work, and I believe it deals with Its subleet as consist ly and thoroighlv as existing conditions permit. I aiu satisfied that he ~educd tar Iff duty provided for in the proposed legls. lation added to the existing internal reve nue taxation, will in the near funre hough, perhaps, not Immediatdv, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of th government. The committee, after full con sideration. and to provide ng.tin-'t a tempo rary deficiency which may exist before the business of the eountrv adjusts Itself to the new tariff schedules, have wlndv em braced in their plan a few additional in ternal revenue taxes. Including a small tax tilon Incomes derived from certain corpo rate investments. The new assessments are not only abso lutely just and easily borne, but thev have the furtherment of being such as can bo re mitted without unfavorable disturbance whenever the necessity of their Imposition no longer exists. In my great desire for the success of this measure cannot restrain the suggestion that If success can only be attained bv means of unseliMi counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform, and as a result of their willingness to subordi nate personal desires and ambitions to the general good. The local Interest affected by the proposed reform are so numerous and BO varied that If all are Insisted upon the legislation embodying the reform must In evitably fall. In conclusion my intense feeling of re sponsibility Impels me to Invoke for the manifold Interests of a generous and con fiding people the most scrupulous en re and to pledge my willing support to every legis lative effort for the advancement "of the greatness and prosperity of c.ir beloved country. 

GKOVKH CMSVKLAND Executive Mansion. Washington, Dec. 4. 1803 Mnlcft Aver it ire Higher in Kvery Stuteln tlie Union llveept Oregon. If nobllltv may be estimated In dollars, the mule Is a nobler animal than the horse, says the New York Sun. Yet there are no' autumnal mule shows, and even if there were It Is hardly probable that flower adorned young women would make a prac. tlce of patting the prize animal. The onlv way to pat a mule, according to the Teva's code, Is wilh a fence rail or a board. The man who collected horse and mule statistics for the census report shows that the average price of a mule is $7 more thau the average price of a horse. The ordlnarv mute in South Carolina, which owns about W.000 of the long-eared beasts. |s worth about $00 the average price of a Ik.im- in the same state Is about S7*-i. Texas probablv has more mules (about 'JOo.ootn than any* other state. The average price is about '$-11. or nearlv twice the value of a Texas horse. In Missouri mules ore worth about S7 more and in Kentucky about $8 more than horses. Only a few states- have no tnules, or so few that the statistician didn't make a note of them. One of these suites Is Uhode Maud, which the mule driver of Texas doubtless would think is not any too large a pastur age and play ground for a festive mule of Southern birth. Oregon Is the only state where horses brl.ig higher price's than mules. The ordinary mule out there is worth M0 and the horse S51. The figures for alCallfornla are: Mules. S07: horses, $40. In Pennsylvania, where mules, for longevity, are much used in the mines, they bring about ?.S0: horses. $67. In this state ther» are seventy times as manv horses as there are nudes, which mini her about 14.000. A New York mule Is worth $01 and tt horse S70. Mules are prized more In New Jersey than iu any oilier stale, the average price being about SloG. or .30 more thau horses. Itlinois has about 14'i.OUO mules, or more than any other Western state.

Thrun's disappearance at tho same time seemed conclusive evidence that he had perished. Mrs. Thrun pro needed to collect the $5o.RiO life insur ance which Thiuu had recently taken out.

Thrun testifies that he was only a tool of Hanson, who organized the scheme. Follett acted as Mrs. Thrun's attorney, while Kaudy harbored Thrun after the burning of the house. To day's proceedings were as follows Han son was placed on the stand and swore In* had m» knowledge of Imhios being brought to Romeo, and had no coumvtiou with Thrun or any one else in reference to the matter. On cross-examination his direct testimony remained unshaken. (J. 1. Follett of Spencer, the attorney who made out pnwU's of loss, was sworn. He claimed to know nothing of the case. Mrs. I l.run employed hini as an attorney to make out tlie claims against the in surance company. N. L.
