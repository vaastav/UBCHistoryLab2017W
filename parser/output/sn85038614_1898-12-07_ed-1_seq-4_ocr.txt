We trust this snggestloa Of the ITesI i? ;;t's will bear ?flOOd and ample fruit. Tin: LATBST coti?o\ DBOISIOR.

PRESIDENT AMI (TRREN-CY. In that part of the President's annuel message, submitted to Congroaa Mon day. In which h<* deals with the currency question, ho says that In hla Judament the present condition of the Treasiny amply Justifies the Imm?diat?? enactment of the legislation he recommended or. year a<-n, umier which a portion of the gold holdings should be placed In a trust fund from which ?/reenbacka should be r, ,l< ? BbSd upon presentation, but when saos rede?m,?l should not thereafter be paid otit except for gold. It Is not to l-e Inferred, however, he adds, that other legislation relating to our currency Is n ,t rc-uind; on the contrary, there is an obvious Ssasaad for it. Thin means that the Presld-nt Is now, H he was a year ai*o, In sympathy witn the general financial theories ami plan of baaklag sad currency reform of Bsere tary-of-the-Tr? asuiy Cage. Just here It Is not asessSSry to go Into the details ??f the ??age plan, eseept in so far as it proviiies for retiring government not??. This provision Is embraced in the that section of a bill which at the last i?>s Blon "f Cnngryss was formulated up ?n Mr. QagS'S reCOmmendatlone, and a sum mary of that section Is as follows; "It establishes In the Treasury De*j ?rr m? n, a division to be hhoWU ?is tag <h vision of issu?? and redemption. To this ?iivisi.in is t?, be transfsned a fund ol t_B,W0,OQ*J In gol'l '??in and bullion, a i?l silver dollars and bullion, equal to the Outstanding Silver certllteates and Trea sury notes of 1S90. The division Is to have charge of all business relating to t;-? Issus, redemption, and exchange of ait forms of United States money, notes, and coin. The S, cr-t.try is also autho rised to make any exchanges that he may ,1,-em best between tin- funds in th?* redemption division and th.- gen? ral funds of the Treasury. When Treasury notes and silver certificates an- redeem? , ,i. ih? y are t.? be h -,<i as part "i the redemption fund, end are only to be ?,? burssd upon th?- receipt of an equivalent amooal .i t!i.- coin in which ths w? re redeemed. in view, however, of the President's r, endorsement of Mr. Qage, an Insight Into the latt.T's Ideas BS ," the working o? his system may not prove uninteresting, and this wl get f i ?mi his annual report!

Mr. Qag, then goes ?m ta say that he shall n??t go outside "t bis duty if he ventures to notai out th sdvai I to the poorer districts <-f th?? country of a "properly-Constituted banking cur rency," and after deocriblng the ootu of the financial movement in the United stat-s, as it now am s on, its frequent forcing of emps ?nu of tin- bands of lbs producir, because ??f blS inability to boi io-, from his local banker, ?'s tendency t?i srrency m the Baandal centres, etc., be "Whoever has followed this delineation of our financial movement, and those who are familiar with the fads Which are thus portrayed, ought ,1('? ta have trouble m perceiving thai the bottom cuis?; ,,f the Irregular an,', deranging , rib, d i- to i?- found la a ii\.-<: volume .?f paper money clothed with full powers nt u legal tender.

In concluiling his discussion of this sub ject, Mr. Qage, while declaring ,h | would not offer the Canadian syetem '? a model from which we should mak i ,,-, exact OOpy," leads us to believe that no would modify his plan largely according to that system in many of Its essentials.
