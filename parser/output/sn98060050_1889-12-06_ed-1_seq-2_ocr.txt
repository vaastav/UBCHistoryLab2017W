'I he opening of the Fifty lirst Congress took place on Monday, when all the ltepuli lican nominees were elected, except that ltev. Mr. Millliuiii, well known us the Mind chaplain and a life long Democrat, was re elected to that post, instead of the nom inee of the caucus. Mr. Heed's speech on taking the chair was scarcely a dozen lines in length, lml was admirable in its spirit and comprehensiveness. The speaker elected, the members were mwoiii in installments alphabetically by slates The iron clad oath having been abolished, ex Confederate and Union sol diers stissl up and took the same oath Tliele was one oath administered to all, mve that four members of the Pennsyl vania delegation, survivors of old Quaker stuck, stepped aside until they could allirm.

The democratic clamor alnmt our pen sion s)steui do not deter Mr. Harrison from declaring for a hroad and hheial poli cy toward the veterans of the late war. '.he suhstauce of his declaration is that he would favor putting on the pension list all hunoralily dint-hurled sliiier who are tie prudent on their nun laUir for support, hut ar prevented hy tlifase or casualty from earning a living. '1'he utterance of the message on the i p lest ion tf civil service retoriu willj;ive nocomfoit to the spoilsmen. The I'resi dent not only promises to administer the law faithfully, 'tut makes several recom mendations of a practical kind in the direr tiou of an advancement of the reform. No pait of the message bears evidence of more careful consideration than that which is devoted to the nero question and the iui)Mrtance of assuring to the eoloied race a free (.allot and a fair count. The loir of the 'resident's direct and uncomprom ising declaration on this suliject is irresUii hle. Nothing could he more true or more evident than that "the wrong does not ex pend itself upon those whose votes are sup pressed," ami when every part of the coun try wakes up to n full realization of the fact thut "every constituency in the I'nion is wronged" hy this systematic suppression of rightful vote, we shall see an earnest and el1ectie movement made to correct this shameful evil. , 4oml Thiiif ia Jo Nlotv (In, It hu become the ciutoni of late with some of our leading state papers, to sou ml a note of warning with legard to the m etiuenl of ICasiern funds in Western mortgage, and to sa) that the slate is Imj iug drained in this waj of money which ought to be kept at home and invested or used for the benelil of home enterprises and of our home pnople. That there is wisdom ami truth hi what I thus mid we have no doubt, but we believe a far g cuter danger now menaces (air Vermont people in the prjteutuud sliiwwdtv managed at t4M4 which uie Iwiug made to induce the iMYw4mnt of Vermont capital iu laud com pany wheiuw and other similar ventures in the Kuuih.

It ttiay be ull very well for train loads of I Miiton millionaires togo on free excursions lo Texas and Alabama and invest their himdieds of thousands thei e, but if men of moderate means try to emulate their ex ample and make haste to get in "on the giound ll-Kir." they will be likely to find in the end that the ground tloor is nothing but a deseitud cellar hole. Thiscine, fortunatelv, has not yet Beied upon Uratttehorn in any serious or general ay, as we believe, hut we are told of one prominent town in Windsor county where busbies h absolutely dead because the place has been literally diained of its tnon ey to put fnto these Southern schemes Other towns ate in almost as bad a case, and their people are morally sure to find in the end that home investments in legiti mate business enterprises, or Western mortgage investments made through agents of known responsibility, are Itonanas by comparison. Vermont can never prosper, or herwastt places he built up anew, while this sort of thing goes on. Iteporl or llir Civil Meivtce ('iuinUUu, The civil service commission, in its re strt to President Harrison, is able to point to a gratifying degree of progress during the past few months. The assertion is em phatically made that in Washington the law- is faithfully and honestly executed without fear or favor. The classified civil service, which alone comes under the juris diction of the commission, now includes alsnit 2S,H0 governmental employes, em braced in four divisions, vii.f the depart mental service, the postal service, the cus toms service ami the railway mail service. This is a gain of ut least hOOU since the He publican administration came iu. It is es tiiuated that the aggregate of the salaries of these t!S.(HH employes alout equals the aggregate of the salaries of all the other minor employes of the government. There fore, of thwe in the service of the govern tnent nearly a fourth in jHjint of numbers, and about a half iu point of imiortaiu'e are now withdrawn from the influences of the patronage svstem, and are appointed, not because they are adheienta of this or that political leader, hut because they are deemed likely to he honest and capable ser vants of the people at large. An earnest plea is made for a larger ap prnpiiation to carry on the work of the roiiniussinu, and stress is laid on the im portance of keeping close watch against sw eeptng removals being made by any otlicial of employes in the classified service. The ie)Krt niint to that best of tests, ex perience, as clearly show iug that the ollices in which the merit svstem ha been most fan ly tried are precisely the oftic iu which the best public work has been done. The system is no longer in the ex pcrimental stage or on probation. It has been given full trial; ulid whenever this trial has been fair the system has worked admirably. It is not contended that the system is ideally perfect. The object the law is to give to the average American citi.en what it takes away from the pro tessional mliticiau. In answering the ac conation frequently brought against th merit sVHtem, that the examinations are of such a character us to favor 'Uvs fresh from school," at the expense of men of ma tuier age, experience and capacity, the commissioners say that this is simply in correct. As a matter of fact, special care is taken to have the examinations as prac tical in character as possible, ami to test each candidate on precisely thone subjects demanded by the character of the work in the branch of the service to which he seeking atimisMou. Hie commissioners strongly object to irrelevant questions, and surely, they say, there can le no questions more irrelevant to a man's duties as clerk or letter earner than are inquiries as to how he voted at the last election, or how- strong Ins political backing is, and these aie precisely the questions that many of the men who thus object to the examina lions Hs impractical," are if. reality de si roiis of asking. .n Krrnroii itiprrtalau. It appears to lie a fact that man) eastern people have gained a w rong impression from the stories of destitution in the new states of Dakota which have lately been published. The reader is likely to get the impression that the destitution is general while such is by no means the case. Much of this wrong impression Arises from the fact that there is not a proper appreciation of the magnitude of the area covered by the Dakota, so that, while one section of this great area may have been unfavorably nhVrted, other sections have not sulTered at all. This latter is, in fact, exactly w hat has happened. It is true that in Kamsey county in the Devil's Iake region, and on the .Missouri slope iu the west, two years of drouth have been disastrous for the farmers who went in there with small means, am! they are in need of assistance, but iu the Red Hiver valley region the season has been one of abundant crops and general prosper ity A ieceut(irand Korks letter, print ed in the Springfield Republican, says that the Northwest as an entirety has had prospeious year, and the lted Hiver valley counties iu paiticular are on a more solid financial footing than at any time befor since their settlement. The farmers are do iug well and are able to help their newly neighbors at the west. This year's total wheat crop of the great Northwest of Mill nusota and Dakota will reach the enormous ttggiegate of

Kuquiry made at the oflice of the Ver mout lmii nnd Ti list company in. this plac confirms this favorable report, for it is stated that the interest on the company 'i loans in the section iu question has lieen paid with unusual promptness, It is a mat ter of justice to have this correction made for it is not pleasant to think of the new stale of North Dakota coming into the I n ion with her people iu a condition of gener al destitution.

The Republicans of Wurd 11, iu Rostou, tried on Monday the experiment of con ducting a caucus on the Austialian ballot system, and it winked like u charm.

I'jiton occupied ltev, Ibm. Robert l'ollers pulpit in the Church of the Messiah, New Vol k city, at the Thankoglv ing diy service last week, giving a half- hour address on civil service reform Mr. latou believes that the people are thor ough!) aroused on the subject of this re form and thnt they w ill support it and all measures tending to establish it as soon ns they understand its tine effects. He sees in liallot reform n great gain to civil service reform, and believes that the establishment of ballot reform throughout the country would be the death blow of the ss)ils sys tem. Mr. r.aton believes that both I'resi- lent Cleveland and President Harrison were iu earnest in meaning to exemplify lit their administrations the highest ground in behalf of the leforiu, but that they were Iriven from this ground by "the incessant assaults of the confederated forces of the (rails system." The friends of the reform, Mr. Katon said, are not con lined to either jtolitical party and should the majority of the Republican party see (it to reject the reform, he believes that the I)enncratir would liml itself compelled "to take it up and go with it before the people in the next presidential election." How Virictiiiii W'm Ciinietl A native Virginian, who serve I iu tlie Confederate army, but for some years has been a Republican, writes to a New Kng- land friend a very calm jet graphic account of the way Virginia was carried by the Democtats at the late election. The letter was not written with the faintest idea that it would ever be published. Its reading will cause serious reflection in many minds. He says : Our state election is over and now be longs to history of the past. Never was Virginia so thoroughly canvasseil. hut to no purpose, for there was a settled deter mutation on the pait oi the Democratic party leaders not to permit the state to U declared for the Republican ticket. The press became extremely violent, ami ortli ern statesmen or speakers who came to Vir Kinia to speak were denounced as low black guards, maliguants and the vilest of creat ures. Most of the registrars ami jinlges of election were put through an examination to see if they were eoual the emergency many were removed and the right kind substituted. It was thought necessary to purge the lists Isith of the living and the leail. Fully 

WI.IMMI legal voters lost their votes by these registrars dioppimr their names from the rolls a few da)sptiorto the election too late to be remedied. This was especially true in the cities. Kiirht hundred legal voters' names iu one ward of Kk'hmoml were erased from the poll Immikh although they had been voting in the ward lor v ears. rive liumlrel in the outlying bstnets of Henrico were dropped in the same way. In Tact, this tuck was laith full) carried out all tluough the eastern part of Virginia, ami then followed the fi nal work on election dav. In everv pait of Virginia where the Republican vote was heavy ami the voters wereroloietl gieat frauds and intimidation of voters prevailed In Norfolk. Richmond, and other large ptaces not moie than our colored voter out of six was allowed to vote The remainder stood in line part of the day and waited uu til the) Iiecamu tltscotirageu, and then lelt, w lute otheas sUhnI in line from tin rising of the sun until long after dark and were not pet milled to vote. Democratic jMilicemen ami young lawvers were present in force to intimidate colored voters. 'A1I this teaches a very important lesson, vi , thut the last lay of hope is rone ff the Republican party to make any headway iu the South The ballot Uixes are all in the hands of Democratic otlicials The county and eotioratiou judges are ull Detn ociatic, so that an appeal from an 'election fraud' of any kind is practically useless; and so )on ran sic how the 'solid South' is made solid. "The Democrats are following up this year's victory with vigorous persecutions--many good and true men have been dis charged by their employers for voting the Republican ticket. The press advises this course, and calls umjh Democratic em plovers to fill every place now held by a Re publican with a Democrat. l fought four )ears for an independent South, but thank (toil I never voted for a corrupt South. The great danger to the South now is that violence, trickery, false hood and perjury being considered worthy modes of carrying on an election against the Reuublicaus. the youni; men growing up and really tiauied to such a standard of morals in public affairs will adopt a similar standard fur their lives in private atlairs, The Democratic leaders of the South know not what curses they Hie invoking for the South of the future,'
