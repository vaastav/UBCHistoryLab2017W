PRESIDENT OX SANTA FE. t APPROVES ACTION TAKEN. j/r. Roosevelt Writes in Reply to Letter from Mr. Moody. Yr&6hi3ttori, Dec 17. — Two important letters concerning the action of the government against the Atchlson. Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company wore made public to-day by authority of President Roosevelt. The letters are under gate of the ISth and 16th lnst-, respectively, one being written by Attorney General Moody and the other by the President. The letters quote court decisions and contain considerable infor mation concerning the action of the President gad the Attorney General in the case, particu larly with reference to the work of tho special counsel Mr. Harmon, or Cincinnati, and Mr. Judson, of St. Louis, who were employed by the government to Inquire into the facts of the case, and who subsequently withdrew from it because their recommendations as to the prosecution of the Santa Fe officials were not adopted. The history of the Santa. Fe case is reviewed In ft letter by Mr. Moody, and the Attorney Go- is position Is approved by the President ft? .a second letter. The Attorney General «ay— you direct me to furnish you with a concise his tory of the case against the Atchison, Topeka and ganta Fe Railway Company. In which that com pany was charged rrlth unlawful rates and prao tjoss in th« transportation of coal for the Colorado fuel and Iron Company, and a statement of the bearir.g of the recent decision of Judge Phillips, of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Missouri, upon the case, and especially upon the action which you have hereto fore taken respecting it 

REPORT AGAINST ACTION. The Attorney General recites the investiga tion and report of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which suggested that the road's practice was in violation of a restraining order issued against it In March, 1902, on a bill In equity brought by the' United States. The At torney General reported to the President that proceeding* under the restraining order could not be maintained, saying:: Under ordinary conditions the advice which I gave you probably would have been regarded by pa as conclusive against the undertaking of any action based upon the restraining order. But the circumstances were extraordinary, and very great public Interest hi the case existed, aroused by the fact that Mr. Morton, a member of your Cabinet had been vlco-prssident of the railway company charged with the management of the traffic dur ing a part of the time in which the practices com plained Of continued. I therefore suggested the employment of special counsel of eminence and you directed their employment. Tie Instructions to the counsel, dated Feb ruary 14 last, the letter shows, presented two questions — In what manner, if any, the in junction In this case was affected by the de cision of tha Supreme Court In the Missouri Pacific Railway Company case against the Patted States, and, second, in case coal was within the scope of the injunction at all by rea son of the general clause In the decree enjoin tnr the Santa Fe company from transporting •toy other Interstate traffic" at less than its published rates, whether this general Injunction to obey the law had any force or virtue in It In Tiew of parts of the recent decision of the Su jCToe Court In the Beef Trust case. Ths epeda! counsel." the Attorney General ears, "entertained an opinion upon these two ?as*tions different from that I had expressed to ycrx and that opinion, by your direction, was ao «iri6»c»d in for the purpose of further action." 

DIFFERENCES WITH COUNSEL^ Later, the letter continues, the difference erose between counsel and the Attorney Gen tral as to whether an information for contempt of the injunction should be filed against the T3£i.sglTig oacers of the corporation. On April U. 1905, counsel held that "upon Investigation ot the charge of contempt, evidence might be larthccmJiisT to show whether the managing cOtxrt had baen guilty cf contempt or not." Attorney General Moody adds: "The nature of the evidence which might be expected was not Indicated." On May 19 last tha Attorney General gays he wrote the special counsel that G>era was no testimony against any except tho diner ©facials and Mr. Blddle, who might claim fearraclty, and that as to Mecsra Ripley and atortoc, president and vice-president of the Santa Fe at the time, some evidence ought to BRoede an accusation of contempt of court. The letter reviews the contempt proceedings teought against the company itself by the Presi flßltTs direction and Judge Phllips's order on De iMzixsr 4 last quashing the informations. Judge JfciUsa cited In connection with this the opin ■n Of the Supreme Court of the United States la the Beef Trust case, and held that the rec ord furnished no .foundation for Imputing- to Xesrrs. Ripley and Morton, president and vfce pfseldent of the road at the time, any personal ■mxmirtbfllty for the alleged violation of the asterstate Commerce law. The Attorney Gen tstfa letter says: I have stated that Judge Philips issued the re ftratalng order drawn Into question by these in pnrations for contempt. The order was Issued BT him after full argument by counsel for the uoltad States and for the railway company. Un- OOBbtedly, his decision in the contempt cases was inconsistent with his decision upon the original MQ In equity praying the injunction, a demurrer to which he overruled, subsequently issuing the restraining order. But since his first decision the Supreme Court had decided the cases of the Mis souri Pacific Railway Company vs. the United gtates and Swift vs. the United States, and Judge BfIJM regarded these two decisions as fatal to the validity of the restraining order. I hardly ne»d say that in my opinion the decision of Judge Philips I* a correct expression of the law, because, as you ■how, It is In conformity with the advice given to you at the very threshold of these proceedings, sad at all times, from then until now, believed 27 me to be sound. In any event, the decision is ™*i because the government has no appeal upon i. question of this kind. THE

ENUE 1 company, including Mr. Paul Morton, recently a member of my Cabinet. In my letter of June 12 last. In reply to yours of June 5, in which you advised the course which haa actually been taken and which has been so signally justified by the event, I wrote you that. In my Judg ment, as in your own, you would have been wholly without Justification in proceeding Indi vidually against the officers of. the company, as there was not a particle of evidence against them. I added, that "one of the officers, Mr. Morton, is a member of my Cabinet. This fact Is not to be allowed to shield him; nor. on the other hand, is it to be allowed to cause him to be singled out, or the officers with whom he as sociates to be singled out, for attack." I directed you to proceed against the company, and, of course, to proceed against any Individual officer if any testimony was produced showing that he had been personally truilty either by act or connivance; stating that I agreed with the doubt you had expressed as to whether there was good ground for proceeding even against the companies; but that I also agreed with you that we should try to obtain the Judgment of the court on th<* question as to whether the injuno tion was sufficient and whether, therefore, there was any ground of action whatever. The result shows that you were entirely right in your doubt whether the injunction was sufficient to cover the ca»e. I am much pleased with the remarks quoted by you In which Judge Philips speaks of the at tacks made on Mr. Paul Morton. Tour original advice to me was to direct that the evidence be fore the special counsel who had advised action against these and other officials individually should be submitted to Judge Philips, who had issued the Injunction, to sea whether action could be taken against any of them personally. I refused to take this action. Jud^e Philips (who had before him all the evidence which was before the special counsel) In his decision exactly covers the point which would have been raised If I had followed your advice. He says: "This instance has attracted considerable pub lic attention because of the sensational associa tion of the name of ... Paul Morton . . . then vice-president of the defendant company, with the transaction. The record in the case, however . . . (Including the) evi dence taken before the Interstate Commerce Commission, fails to furnish any foundation for imputing to those gentlemen any personal re sponsibility for the alleged violation of the In terstate Commerce law." The decision of the court, therefore. Is not only that you were absolutely right in the ad vice you gave me as to the corporation, but fur thermore, and explicitly, that there was no pos sible ground for action against Mr. Morton. No action in addition to that which you proposed could properly have been taken. The course actually taken was absolutely proper, and the decision of the court, and the opinion of the judge above quoted show that to have taken the course proposed by the special counsel would have been unjust. Sincerely yours, THEODORE ROOSUV kHJT. TO ADJOURN THIS WEEK. Uttle Work in Congress Expected Before Holidays. Washington, Dec 17.— The Senate will meet the wishes of the House for an adjournment for the Christmas holidays on Thursday next. Meantime the Senate will probably content Itself with com paratively little work unless there should be diffi culty in agreeing with the House on the terms of the Panama Canal Emergency Appropriation bill. That measure will go to a conference committee early In the week, and there will be a united effort to reach a decision before the holiday adjournment. The action of the Senate in attempting to , eliminate the bond provision and make a separate law of It will probably be the principal bone of contention in the conference committee. The reorganization of the Senate committees will be announced Monday or Tuesday. Senator Galllnger will make an effort to have the Merchant Marine hill made the unfinished business, not with a view of obtaining serious consideration of It before Christmas, but to have it in position to be pressed when Congress reconvenes. The four days before the holiday adjournment will be used In the House for discssion of federal control of insurance and the enactment of the Panama bill. There are many members who de sire to talk about insurance. Speaker Cannon has ooncurred in the general view in the House that the President's message furnishes as good a basis as anything else for this debate. Many members will not wait until Thursday to return to their homes, for the holidays. The Ways and Means Committee will continue It's hearings of the Philippine tariff, and the Ap propriations Committee will begin the preparation of the District of Columbia Appropriation bill. The Statehood bill Is to be perfected, but will not, under the present plan, be brought Into the House until January 4. when it is expected to be the first busi ness. 

ANSWERS MR. CULBERSON. Panaman Denies "Intrigue Under Shadow of Capitol." Washington. Dec. 17-— Nlcanor A. de Obarrio, for mer Minister of War and Marine of the Republic of Panama, in a statement issued to-day, replied to remarks made in the Senate by Mr. Culberson, who declared that the $10,000,000 paid by the United States to Panama "was no more nor lees than a payment to the Intrigants and conspirators there, who organized in this city under the very shadow of the CapitoL" Mr. Obarrio. after explaining that he was one of the eight persons who planned the separation of Panama from Colombia, says: According to the Hay-Herran treaty, approved by the United States Senate, and the rejection of which by Colombia was the main cause of the separation of Panama, the United States agreed to pay to the Republic of Colombia $10,000,000 for cer tain privileges, and according to the Hay-Bun au Varilla treaty, approved by the republic of Pana ma and by the United States Senate, the same sum was paid for securing even greater privileges. At the time this sum was paid the republic of Panama was a perfectly constituted nation, recognized by all but two of the countries of the globe. The $10, 000,000 have been disposed of in this manner: M.CiO.OOO invested in mortgages in New York real estate at an average of 4 per cent per annum; $1 000,000 for the establishment of a national bank, $500 <XO loaned to Panama bankers on call, and $600,000 employed in converting our silver coin to the new coinage of the republic of Panama, and for depositing a sum sufficient to guarantee the parity of our Bilver with United States gold, at the rate of two silver dollars for one gold dollar. The rest has been employed In building school houses, roads, bridges and the thousand and one things that for years have been needed in our country. As to the statement that the separation of Panama was accomplished "under the shadow of the Capitol," I most emphatically deny in my name and in that of my colleagues that any public man of this or any other country had anything to do with the revolution, so successfully accomplished by vi« with the valuable aid of 99 9-10 per cent of the Inhabitants of Panama. NEW TUCKER EVIDENCE. "Canadian Pin" Said to Belong to Portland Woman. [By Telegraph to The Tribune.] Boston, Dec. 17.— Startling disclosures in the Tucker murder case have come to his counsel within the last forty-eight hours, and they now feel certain that he will get a new trial as the result of new evidence they have obtained. This new evidence Is said to be strongly in his favor. His counsel have little doubt of his acquit tal. One point is that the "Canadian pin," the chief circumstantial link against Tucker, will be Identified by a Portland (Me.) woman as one she lost at the time Tucker says his wife found It in Portland. This pin was alleged by Miss Amy Rob erts the Page family's servant, as being the prop erty of her murdered mistress. MIDSHIPMEN WILL TESTIFY SOON. Annapolis. M..

Suggests Insurance Law by Con gress for Test Before Courts. Washington. Dec 17.->James R. Garfield, Commissioner of Commerce and Labor, in bis annual report, makes a strong argument for federal regulation of corporations doing an in terstate business, suggesting a federal license, or charter, with power to examine books and "to stop the operations" of any corporations so licensed found violating the federal statutes. He also recommends, in regard to insurance laws, in order to test its power to control insurance companies, that Congress formu late a law which may be made the basis of a decision by the Supreme Court. The work of the bureau In furnishing "publicity" In regard to business methods is commented on, and the special report on the beef industries explained and defended. In beginning his argument for federal regu lation of corporations Mr. Garfield declares that he is convinced that no permanent remedy for existing evils can be expected until Congress more fully exercises its power for affirmative action under the commerce clause of the Con stitution. He says that it is obvious that Juris diction of single States, as applied to great cor porations, is futile and even harmful- as such businesses have grown beyond the possibility of control by a single State. The relations of cor porations to transportation companies alone, he says, furnish a sufficient reason for bringing them under feneral regulation. Mr. Garfield declares that it Is impossible to prevent rebate abuses by railroads by purely penal regulation, saying, however, that the en forcement of the present law has compelled some respect for it, which was previously wholly lacking. As regards forms of combination, he says that the imposition of a penalty on one form of such activity simply drives the men in It to seek some other device. His suggestions as to regulation are: It may be accomplished either by a license to engage in such commerce or by a charter granted by the federal government. Under either form Congress should provide all require ments necestary to Insure publicity and honesty in promotion, reserving to the government the right of inspection of the books of such cor poration, and the further right— the most im portant of all— to stop the operations of such corporation if it becomes a violator of the fed eral statutes, at all times preserving to the cor poration and Its stockholders the right of Judi cial appeal against the Improper exercise of ex ecutive authority. Such a law, he says, would be no invasion of individual liberty, and would lessen the possi bilities of unfair and dishonest competition, while giving; proper protection to individuals, and It would leave to the courts such subjects as the reasonableness of combination, conspira cies in restraint of trade, and monopolies. The report Bays that the compilation of the Insurance laws of the various States haa been completed, and some special phases of the ques tion of federal control examined, but that in view of certain Supreme Court decisions the commissioner has not felt warranted in assum ing Jurisdiction of companies for the purposes of Investigation. The suggestion regarding action by Congress Is then made. 

REPORT ON BEEF INDUSTRIES. In the special report on the beef industries the reasons previously given for withholding certain information are repeated. It is re marked that those criticisms of the report which tended to disprove any specific statement in it were based on estimates or taken from isolated instances, and that in no case was any informa tion thus given that would be of any real as sist ance in correcting figures had they been found lnaccuratft. The report also discusses the general work of the bureau. It tells of the need of accurate In formation on the complex Industries of the country, and of the effect which the furnlahln* of such information to Congress and to the pub- Uo has already had. Mr. Garfield declares that public opinion, when it has such information to act on, will in many cases lead to the correction of abuses without legislation, and says that in Beveral instances the victims of abuses have in formed the bureau that the mere investigation by it of the facts have led to a discontinuance of the Improper methods, and that, from their Individual point of view, great good haa already resulted from the bureau's work. The report follows: Sir: I have the honor to submit the report of the Commissioner of Corporations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1905. There has been no change in the organic law under which the bureau was organized. Further Etudy of the law, and practical work under it, confirm the opinions expressed In the first general report of this bureau as to Us purpose and scope. The total appropriations for the bureau were $156,220. Of this amount $113,855 <J4 has been ex panded. An unexpended balance amounting to wV 953 40 was re-appropriated for the fiscal year 1005-06, which together with the regular appropriations, makes' available for this year a total sum or 121 7 879 40. The number of persons employed by the bureau on June 30, 5905, was 74, an increase of 22 since the preceding year. The methods of accounting, dis tribution of expense to the various special Investi gations and responsibility lor public property have been so elaborated as to show the exact cost or bureau work, and have made it possible to prevent unnecessary expense. "With the beginning or the new fiscal year the appropriations for the depart ment made possible the discontinuance of all regu lar details of employes from this bureau for de partmental work. The estimates for the year end- Ing June 30, 1907, are $248,700, being an increase of $30,820 60, to keep pace with the growth .of the The U work of the last year has again emphasized the advantage of a lump sum appropriation. has been possible to employ men when and where they were needed, and at such salaries as to command efficient men possessed of special or technical 1c ""The general legal work of the bureau was the The general legal work of the bureau was the completion of the examination of the subjects hav ing to do with the powers and duties of the Com missioner and the interpretation of the organic act particularly as to the provisions regarding the compulsory attendance of witnesses and production of evidence. A number of legal questions indirectly affecting the work of the bureau have been con sidered, and further examination made of the State and Territorial statutes relating to industrial corporations and their organization. The digest of all anti-trust legislation has been completed, and is now practically ready for publication. SPECIAL. INVESTIGATIONS. 1 BEEF INDUSTRY.— The published portion of this report dealt chiefly with the question of prices and the margin of profit in the packing business. In the course of this investigation the bureau had also obtained much information bearing upon the question of combination as between the large pack- Ing companies. At the time of the publication of the report the Department of Justice had under advisement proceedings agniiist certain packing companies and their officers for violation of the federal tmti-trust law. It was obvious, there fore, that the publication of the information possessed by the bureau on the subject was inex pedient at that time, axid accordingly, by direc tion of the President, ail the Information possessed by the bureau on the subject of such combination was withheld from publication. Although this fact was set forth in the published report, the failure to treat therein of the question of combination was the subject of criticism. A further ground of criti cism was the failure of the rprort to treat of dis criminations by means of private car companies. At the time of making the report the extent and nature of governmental control over such com panies was the subject of pending litigation, and it would have hf»en improper to anticipate the deci sion by assuming In advance any Jurisdiction over them. Other criticisms were directed at the accuracy of the figures and conclusions relating to prices and profits but only a few tended to disprove any specific statement In the report, and thoso particular criticisms were based upon figures se cured by estimate*, or taken from a. very few. iso lated instances , and hence did not disprove the re sults stated in the report, which were based on general averages obtained from figures covering the entire Industry and the glaughter of several millions of animals. In no case was any Infor mation thus given that would be of real assistance in oorrecting figures had they been found inac curate. • The investigation developed the line of division between the work of the Department of Justice and the bureau- The bureau. In obtaining facia upon which the President may make recommenda tion* to Corigrfiss, necessarily will obtain facts which might require prosecutions under the anti-trust law. As stated in my former report, such faeu must be reported to the President for such ac tion as he may deem necessary to take. He way find it nooessary to report them to the Attorney Crener&i.

The Department of Justice has to do with prosecu tions for violation of law— bureau obtains facts for Congressional consideration; the line* of work may at times cross tind overlap, but they do not conflict. If prosecutions are pending or intended, the bureau would of course not take such action as would Interfere therewith. In this particular investigation cases were pending in me courts under the direction of the .Department of Justice; hence it was not proper that the bureau should use Its power In such manner as would embarrass the Department of Justice In its ac tion relating to combination or other violation of law. 2. OIK. AND STEEL INDTJSTRIES^-The House of Representatives passed two other resolutions directing inquiries into the oil and steel Industries. On both of these subjects the bureau had already made extensive inquiries, and was ready to take up immediately, in addition to the general work, the special lines indicated by the resolutions. A special report on the oil industry will shortly be made to the President. 8. 

OTHER INDUSTRlES.— lnvestigations of the sugar, tobacco, coal and lumber industries are In progress. i. INSURANCE*— The compilation of State insur ance laws has been finished, a-d some special phases of the question of federal supervision havo been examined, but in view of the decisions of the Supreme Court I have not felt warranted in trying to assume jurisdiction over insurance companies for the purpose of Investigation. The fact that State supervision has failed to prevent great abuses In the management of some companies does not of Itself justify federal action. It must be shown, first, that Insurance is subject to federal regulation under the commerce clause of the Con stitution; second, that federal supervision would he of such a character as to correct existing abuses and prevent future ones, and, third, that such su pervision would result not only in greater security to policyholders, but would relieve them. Through their companies, of the great and unnecessary ex pense of duplicated Inspections and investigations by different States. Seemingly the most effective way to settle the question la for Congress to so legislate upon the subject as to afford an oppor tunity to present to trie Supreme Court the ques tion whether insurance as now conducted is in terstate, commerce, and hence subject to federal regulation. 

POSITION OF BUREAU. The position of the bureau at the time of its creation was unique. It owed its existence largely to a public feeling arising- from unusual industrial developments. Public opinion thereon was vigorous, tout confused and vague. In general, the tremen dous concentration of industrial power, the obvious use in many instances of improper Industrial meth ods of competition and the instances of clearly un sound or fraudulent finance connected with cor porations, led to the general belier that there had arisen a. new industrial problem, a set of condi tions not adequately met by existing laws. No so lution of this problem had then received general acceptance, nor had the problem itself been clearly stated. Numerous experiments at solution had been made by way of anti-trust laws, but the ad mitted futility of most of these laws led only to the negative conclusion that such was not the way to treat the great industrial changes of which every one was cognizant. - Upon only one point can It be said that public opinion was fairly clear and unanimous, and that point was the desire for "publicity"— other words, the desire for information. It was not clearly understood to what use this information should be put, nor, indeed, what subjects it should cover; but the demand for accurate information was fundamentally sound. The policy of the bu reau has been framed in accordance with this de mand. Its field may be divided Into subjects re lating to law on the one hand and subjects re lating to economic Industrial facts on the other. It must examine and compare the statutes under which the corporations are doing business with Industrial and statistical facts. A statute is the formal expression of public opinion. Hence statutes designed to Improve industrial con ditions will not be based upon sound economic prin ciples unless public opinion which they express is the result of an accurate knowledge of Industrial methods. Not only Is legislation dependent upon public opinion, but likewise moral standards in business and the rules of daily commercial Intercourse, which cannot be enforced by statute, are created and sustained by public opinion. Current events have strikingly demonstrated the tremendous re formative force of public opinion without the In tervention of law. Existing business methods will be "changed In accordance with public opinion. Heretofore the -wide scope of corporate operations and the baffling diversities of Federal and State laws have made an Intelligent public opinion Im possible. The average man can easily judge of an isolated commercial' transaction between himself and his neighbor, but he utterly lacks the statistical and legal information necessary to view Justly the operations of the great corporations doing business throughout the country. COiTPLEX INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS.— trial conditions are extremely complex, far-reach ing, and composed of a multitude of detailed facts. To form an Intelligent opinion of permanent Indus trial tendencies it Is tiecesary not only to know accurately all the facts found In industrial condi tions, but especially to be able to arrange these facts In their proper relation. Many mistakes of public opinion have been due to a failure to sep arate the essential from the non-essential, to g'vo proper weight to the various facts. Much legis lation has been enacted which is futile and often harmful because directed either at the modification of great economic laws, which cannot be modified by statute, or at the treatment of sporadic and sensational facts. Estimate* guesses, yrujuilicea, and limited individual experience have been the bases of action, rather than broad and final con clusions based Upon accurate, properly arranged masses of fact*. The bureau, therefore, has endeavored not only to obtain aocurate, reliable Information and facts sufficient in number to be representative, but also i to draw conclusions that Fhfill represent permanent j tendencies rather than individual Instances. To this end It has. with a force of carefully trained em- I ployes, taken up given Industries dealing in im portant staples, and collected statistics and facts I relating thereto; has then digested this Information I so as to obtain what might be called reliable gen- I eral averages, and has endeavored* to deduce from i them conclusions as to permanent corporate meth i ods and tendencies. It Is strongly felt that preventive rather than ! remedial means must be used in dealing- with the ! entire problem. The government must, deal before ' hand with causes, not merely afterward with their ■ effects. In order to ascertain proper methods of prevention It is necessary to know the causes of In j dustrial evils. The work of the bureau has brought out. to an extent not reached before, the actual methods used In certain industries: their methods of competition, of economies In production and dis tribution, of discriminations In distribution and transportation: and also the results of such meth ods-In obtaining or tending to obtain monopolist control. Its work has shown, in the case of the several great industries already investigated or now under investigation, the fact that the predom inant control enjoyed by certain great concerns la based usually upon one or two, or a very few, single factors, sucn as the control of transporta tion, of trade marks, of patent rights, of raw ma terial, special legislation, or a combination of on» or more of these factors. !?;toh Information will afford the basis for an in telligent public opinion, and it will constitute "pub licity" of a sort that will be efficient In correcting some prevalent abuses. An illustration of this principle has already been obtained in numerous cases where the bureau ha 3 been Investigating op pressive and unjust methods of competition. In a considerable number of cases the victims of such methods have informed the bureau that the mere Investigation of these facts has led to a dlsreon tinuanoe of the methods, and have assure.! the bureau that, from their individual standpoint, frrrat good has already resulted to them from the bureau's work. The year's work upon the investigation of special industries and particular corporations has strengthened my conviction that no permanent remedy for existing industrial evils can be expected until Congress exercises mere fully its power of affirmative action ;ind*T the commerce clause of the Constitution. No fact of industry Is more ob vious than that modern business has outgrown and wholly disregards State lines, and that the juris dictions of single State 3, as applied to the opera tions of a great Interstate business, are futile and ever, harmful. A close study of the methods of organization and operation of the greater indus trial corporations, their relation to transportation companies, both rail and water, their methods of competition. the extension of their business throughout many States, rind the sale of their commodities throughout the world proves that they have actually gone beyond the possibility of proper supervision or control by th« single State which pave them corporate existence. Their rela tion to the transportation companies alone is a sufficient reason for bringing them under federal regulation. RAILROAD ADVANTAGES TO SHIPPERS. It is Idle to claim that the railroads are wholly at fault for rebates, discriminations and other devices for affording to one shipper Improper advantage? over a competitor. It is Impossible to prevent such abuses by purely penal legislation. This does not mean that the enforcement of the anti-trust law has not been beneficial, for It has. Its enforcement has compelled some respect for the law. which until recently was wholly lacking. But so far as effecting a permanent change of the conditions which that law denounces, but little has been done. The imposition of a penalty upon a com bination simply drives the men in that combina tion to the formation of another device for accom plishing the sum* purpose, and this for the reason Avoid Imitations !

By the exercise of the affirmative power granted under the commerce clause Congress can with safety provide a method by which reasonable com bination may be permitted.

The power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, being plenary, that body may determine to what extent It will first exercise Its power. The transportation companies moat clearly should come within the terms of such a measure; and with them should be Joined the greater corporations engaged In the production, manufacture and distribution of those staples which affect the lives of the people of this country, and the monopolization of which will necessarily result in hardship and injustice to the Individual. Such a law is not an invasion of Individual liberty or right: Is not an effort to have the government do that which the Individual could best do; and would not, in Its effect, destroy in dividual enterprise nor the possibility of Individual success. It would afford equality of opportunity, not equality In results. It is universally recognized that the great high ways of commerce should be open to all upon equal terms. It Is likewise true that the opportunities for the Individual to engage' In Industrial enter prise should be equally free. The individual Is not strong enough ordinarily to protect himself against a great corporation. He can be secure In his rights only under a law which subjects the corpora tion to regulation by a government whose Jurisdic tion is broad enough and whose power is great enough to compel obedience. Such a law would lecsen the possibilities of unfair and dishonest com petition. Under such a law the questions of the rea sonableness of combination, of conspiracies In re straint of trade, of monopolistic control, would he left, as they should be, for the determination of the courts: and the government would then have, as it should have, the opportunity at all times to know the detailed operations til those corporations to which it has granted great portrs, upon which It has Imposed great responslbflHlos, and over which it will exercise Its full measure of protection so long as they obey the laws of the land. It Is not necessary to repeat what was stated in my last annual report regarding the relative merits of federal license or a national Incorporation law. If the principle of federal regulation be agreed upon, there will be little difficulty in determining which method nhould be adopted. JAMES RUDOLPH GARFIELD, Commissioner of Corporations- The Secretary of Commerce and Labor. m THE TEN-YARD RULE IN FOOTBALL. It iumi to me that those who bay* not been In favor of tin 10-yard rule have not thoroughly considered all Its possibilities In their entirety. They have been led to jump to conclusions that because It la difficult to gain fly» l^rt:» in three downs under tHe present ru:ea. it would be wellnlght Impossible to gain ten yards In three downs. In arjuin*- thus ti.ey lose sight of two very important f«at vr«a. ljt>i me talcs up the first of these features— namely, that the practice in preparation for some eight weeks would be quite different If It were absolutely necessary to gain ten yards. All coaches know thai In the early days of the season 1". Is not unusual for teams to erperlrnont upon plays having- considerable possibility tn them, but requir ing perhaps unusual handling of the ball, like double parser or different gxoui>inc of the players, or perhaps the ride of a long outside pans. These variations Lave tn past years nut been unusual during the first half of the •fasos. Gradually, however. owing to the number of fum bles, the chance of Accident and the possibility of losing the ball, these plays are. as a rule, abandoned or super ceded by play» where the ball Is held more closely, where double or unusual passing ts not called Into use, and where, therefore, the chance of a mistake is minimized. These plays toward which a team eventually drifts are of the nature of >MSf plays and jsojil for only short distances, but enough to that when well executed (bey shall r.rt rive or »ix yanl3 In three downs with fair certainty, or, rather, shall stand -i very good chance of netting two anl one half yards at a down The fart le. therefure, that no team has really sacrificed a short sucoMatOß o{ trains to the possibilities of long gains by keeping up their practice of these more intricate plays entirely through a season, Cornell possibly came the nearest to it. and in one match with !vrii:K}liarila made some startling gains with plays that were highly unusual. Harvard haa made one or two attempts at it. but never consistently throughout a sea son. If possibly we may except one year when ah outsLie put's was in use which really proved fairly effective, es pecially In consideration of the fact thai the Tale line was more act Ire and acgresstve than the Ilarvur-J line upon that cj-tion Now. if a team were forced to prac tice plays thai *u>od a chance of gaining lor.Rer distances even at the risk of losing the tall, it Is fair to suppose that their execution of thtso i layn would be much more highly developed, and the chance, therefore, ofgalßs ren d.i-eo far more ocrula. — UV&iter Qua* la :";.« OuUa* iU|Uilt«
