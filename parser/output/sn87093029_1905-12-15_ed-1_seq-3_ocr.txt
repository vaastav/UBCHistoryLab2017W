C.—At 11:40 Tues day morning assistant secretary to the president, Barnes, and executive Clerk Young and a messenger left the White House bearing copies of the presi dent's message for reading in the house and senate and for distribution among the member. The reading of the message began at 12:23, eight minutes later than in the senate. It required three hours to read. President's Message. To the Senate and House of Rep resentatives —The people of this coun try continue to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebb and flow will be felt more or less by all members of the community, both by the deserving and undeserving. Against the wram of the Lord the wis dom of man can not avail; in times of flood or drought human ingenuity can but partially repair the disaster. A general failure of crops would hurt all of us. Again, if the folly of man mars the general well-being, then those who are innocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of the folly. A panic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the busi ness community would hurt the whole business community. £ut such stop page of welfare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting. In the long run the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of the country is the high individual character of the average American citizen, no mat ter whether his work be mental or manual, whether he be farmer or wage-worker, business man or profes sional man. Talks on Corporations. Corporations are the first great sub ject dealt with. He says he is not opposed to corporations. Like trade unions they have come to stay. Each must be checked when they are not doing good. He thinks their regula tion possible under existing conditions but if not the constitution must be amended. The power to regulate must be affirmative and given to some ad ministrative body created by congress. He says such a body should have the power to judge of the reasonableness of a railroad rate and to prescribe the limit beyond which it shall be unlaw ful to go. All decisions on rates must be subject to revision by the courts. He does not favor power being given to originate rates, but to regulate rates already fixed. "I regard the power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform in the 'V-tter of railway regulation. a\ \ private car lines, industrial erii.Xs, refrigerator charges, etc., ./should be controlled by the commis sion. Labor Question Taken Up. Again recommends compulsory use of block signals on interstate railroads and recommend regulation of hours of railroad workmen and the liability of employers for injuries.

He considers Porto Rico and insular affairs in general. Delegate for Alaska. He earnestly asks for an elective delegate for Alaska and recommends that Oklahoma and Indian Territory be admitted as one state and that Kew Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one state. He goes into canal affairs, but says he will recommend type at a later date. He finishes with the recommen dation for more adequate provision for the state department.
