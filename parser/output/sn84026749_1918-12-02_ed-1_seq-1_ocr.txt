You read that a fleet of ships Is preparing to escort the Presi dent out to sea. And the cable tells you that from the other side another fleet is preparing to sail out and meet the President in The President, yon may be sure, will stop that nonsense when he hears of the plan. The coal to be used in such non sensical, asinine, monarchical display- would be paid for by citi zens that have been urged to save every pound of coal for two years past. It -would be too preposterous to waste thousands of tons of coal 

"ESCORTING" the democratic president of a republic on his way to make the world safe for DEMOCRACY. One ship is enough for ONE citizen of America. He cannot sail on forty ships, and to send extra ships with him, to show how important he is, would be like sending along Solomon's col lection of wives. Such idiocy is out of date. If the submarines were still at work, no precaution could be too great, no expense excessive. The only danger now is from floating mines; an escorting fleet can't help there. The other danger is the possibility of injuring Wood row Wilson with the people who 

NEED to have confidence in him by organising for him snch a trip as, in these democratic days, would make the Shah of Persia ridiculous. How does this suggestion for demobilizing the army ttrike you? Instead of keeping millions of men in camp here and in Eu rope, paying them, feeding them, keeping t-iem idle, non-productive, send the men home now as rapidly as possible, and after they get home, CONTINUE THEIR PAY for a reasonable time, until they shall have found a job? The idea now is to dismiss the men from the army SLOWLY to avoid turning loose a great num ber of men without work or means of support. But pay them their army wages, $30 a month or better, until they find-work, and they won't be without means of sup port. This plan would save money for the Government; the soldier would boardhimselfBaJjis wages and-be sHBrte-do itf the Govern ment would save his keep. .Jt.-would give "thoVaenV freed" Iran camp, a chance to look .-.bout, for .a job and adapt them selves gradually to conditions. As long as you keep them in barracks, they are unable to make any -plans for the future or place themselves in useful work. The country .could .afford to feed, clothe, transport, and pay millions of men that they might .go abroad to kill people very useful work a little while ago; the country can afford for a little while to continue their pay while they look for useful work in this country. Send the soldiers home, CON TINUE THEIR PAY. The New York Times, lament ing the evident tendency toward Government ownership, says: "We shall have a gigantic con trolling centralized government, able to bring irresistible political pressure by means of Its mastery of communications. Industry, ag riculture, labor. looking to it for punishment or reward, must be po litically .subservient or take the consequences." That Is false, as proved by gov ernment ownership of telegraphs, telephones, and cables in England and In France, and by government ownership of the railroads in France But suppose that public owner ship or public property DID mean, as alleged, a centralized power able to bring pressure to bear. "Which would you prefer? Would you have that centralized power in the bands of the President, whom you can put out of office at the end or four years, or impeach any day, in the hands of a Con gress that you can change. Or would you have that power. In the f future, as In the past, in the hands t of a few Irresponsible individuals charging all the traffic will bear, with their lobbyists in Washington- controlling Spnslnr non,&. -ecntatives, dictating to the Gov ernment "able," in the language of the Times, "tp bring irresistible pressure by means of mastery of communications." You have Been the State of Penn sylvania, ruled by the Pennsylva nia Railroad, the State of New York, ruled by the New York Cen tral, through Its lobbyists in Al bany, making Its chief lobbyist president of the railroad and then Senator. You have seen the public monopolies of the United States privately owned, largely control ling the Government of the United States and the lawmaking ma chinery of the United States. Under private ownership, those that use the power are beyond the reach of the people, unless they are indicted for stealing, which Is unusual, and convicted, which, as the New York. New Haven and Hartford Railroad Incident shows, is practically Impossible. Unde- mrlic jrf rship the rail-

Edmond Jlostand, famous -French dramatist, known universally as the author of "Chan ticleer,' died of pneumonia at 1:30 p. m. today. Rostand' was born in 186S at Mar seilles. Early in his career he went to Paris and produced a volume of verse of little importance, entitled Les Musardlses." His first drarv, "Lea Romanesques," acted In 1891 and published. in 1899, was a success in the rococo style, followed by "La rnncesse io-ataine" (1896, publish ed 1899) and "La Samaritalne" (1897. published 1898), "A Gospel in Tfyree Tableaux," as he called it, mystic aid pre-Raphaellte. All these show ed a precocity of diction and a great talent for supple and sinuons verse. Je01 continents, and pronounced by Faguet the finest dramatic poem of half century," though soberer judgment may pronounce it charming rather than strong. This was founded on the Ufa of an actual parsonage. Rostand's next play was historical. "IAiglon" (1300) has for Its central figure and Ineffectual hero the un happy Duke of Re'chstadt. "Napoleon IL" If, as Is asserted. Rostand's first work h "La Samaritalne." he bigan his dramatic development as a dis ciple of Tolstoy and Maeterlinck, Ros scttl and Verlaine. "Les Romanes ques" is more like the comedies of Musset. ' "brilliant stuff," as Lcmaitro has called It. "sparkling and glowing In places with a large and easy gayety, frank Ilght-heartedness. and plastic grace." Seeae Also In Utopia. "La Princesse Lolntalne" has its scene also In Utopia, here called Irl poll and In "any period, so that the ocstume be pretty " The subject, the lore of the troubadour prince Jaufro Rudel for the fair Mellsande, which had attracted Heine. Browning and Swinburne, produces a result more beautiful as a poem thsn "Cyrano" or "LAIglon." but less dramatically effective In presentation. Besides these dramas. Rostand, who called himself the "poet of precox ity." depicted what has been styled "a pastel of Roxane's younger sister" In "La Journee d'une precleuso," which shows a member of the charmed cir cle of the Hotel de Ramboulllet. occu pied with the innocent artifices of a fashionable bluestocking.

No such movement of troops ever took place before, across 3,000 miles of sea. followed by adequate equipment and supples, and carried safely through extraordinary dan gers of attack dangers which were alike strange and Infinitely diffi cult to guard against. In all this movement only 758 men were lost by enemy attack 630 of whom were upon a single English transport which was sunk near the Orkney Is lands. I need not tell you what lay back of this great .movement of men and material. It Is iot Invidious to say that back of It lay a supporting or ganization of the Industries of the country and of all Its productive ac tivities more complete, more thorough in method., and effective In result, more spirited and unanimous In pur pose and effort than any other great belligerent had been able to effect We profited greatly by the experience of the nations which had already been engaged for nearly three years In the exigent and exacting business, their every resource and every executive proficiency taxed to the utmost. We were their pupils.

But It Is not the physical scale and executive efficiency of preparation, supply, equipment, and dispatch that I would dwell upon, but the mettle and quality of the officers and men we sent over and of the sailors who kept the seas, and the spirit of the nation that stood behind them. No soldiers or sailors ever proved them selves more quickly ready for the test of battle or acquitted themselves with more splendid courage and achieve ment when put to the test. Those of us who played some part In direct ing the great processes by which- the war was pushed Irresistibly forward to the final triumph may now forget all that and delight our thoughts with the story of what our men did. Their officers understood the grim and ex acting task they had undertaken and performed It with an audacity, effi ciency, and unhesitating courage that touch the story of convoy and battle with Imperishable distinction at every turn, whether the enterprise were great or small from their great chiefs.
