FRIDAY. IVEC. 6. A NICE DISH OF CROW. scasionally a newspaper which de :d the Democratic party to support :ause of plutocracy as against the c of the people, has the temerity hisper the name of Grover Cleve as the only man whom the Demo -3 can elect president in 1904, and las been done a little of tener since pu ms of pneumonia appeared in manly bosom. To our mind such isinuation is insulting to the Dem ts. The idea that a party which ibrice nominated him and twice ted him to be president of the ed States, and which he deserted, :iuiiced and spat upon, as it were, Id be told that it must eat such , is to say to those who constitute party that they are worse than 38, that they are dumb driven cat On what principle, in heaven's i should Grover Cleveland be vot rby Democrats ? He represents inciple of that party as we under i it. len he was first elected it did as if he did think ot the people, undertook to be one of them. He he burdensome load laid on them te tariff robbers and he made as st an effort as Cleveland could to ye the situation. He saw that leople were taxed more than one red million dollars beyond the int necessary to run the govern , and he saw further that this sented only a modicum of the sums the protected industries g from the poor. He called pub tention to this in a memorable ige. He asserted that "unneces axationis unjust taxation," un e erroneous idea that an honest ssion at the polls would be made s question. Theu he was igno >f the temper of wealth. On that ge be staked bis chances for re in, and on that he lost. No r did he utter those sentiments ilutocracy marked him for her The idea that any puppet of a ent should dare voice any senti so piebean was enougn to doom Every newspaper, and there iany, drawing its pabulum from ders of protection, leaped upon iany others which could be pur like swine, were bought up and I their small caliber guns on him, i vilified like a pick-pocket, de id and damned, until it became anabie whether be should be im dor hung. They literally flay. Ned him alive. When the election came an the pockets of protection had been turned inside out, money was made to flow like water, and the great Grover fell a victim to his folly, and his body lay in the arena mangled and torn. Hut monopoly and plutocracy did not succeed as they had hoped. They caught a tartar in the Hon. Ben Har rison. He was a good protectionist, but, unfortunately,an honest man, and and as many other interests in Wall Street had gone to the aid of protec t ion, which Mr. Harrison did not hug to his bosom they wanted no more of him. T,n the mean time the remains of Grover were gathered together and put back into some kind of shape, they were anointed with a new kind of oil, electricisparkg from various batteries w ere sent into the disfigued remains, and life began to return, the "gold cure" was tried, and tfcis was seen to be a wonderful restorative. At the end of four years diligent work he began to look like himself, in fact he seemed almost entirely to have recovered from the castration he had received. Seeing he was in shape again and the people who had first brought him to public attention thinKing he was the Grover of old, never for a moment suspecting that everydrop of Democrat ic hi ood in him been whipped out, took him up as their candidate onco more. In the mean time the gold cure had worked wonders, and confident of their quarry Wall Street became his most devoted friends and supporters. The country well remembers what happened then, as always happens when Wall Street sets its heart upon a prize,or determines to kill an enemy. Harrison went down and Cleveland went up. Did any more tariff mes sages appear? None that we have heard of. What did appear ? Wall Street's pet measure for the demoneti zation oi silver, a repeal of the Sher tct was demanded by honest , and this was the real wedge plit our financial system and aid and silver both into hiding oded the country with shin ariff issue is dead, lver issue is dead, why t because when anything le want, and of course the corn not want, becomes of so much nee as these measures, the _ otected interests of the coun-1 try combine, put up money, bribe and I buy until they work their overwhelm ing defeat at the polls. When any measure is defeated, no matter how' dastardly the means, the subsidized 1 press and the subsidized political' shouters immediately declare it dead ! because of its alleged unpopularity and the fool people believe the state-' Cleveland did not sign the Wilson bill. Why ? Because he was afraid. views had been frailed out of him, and new ones put in their place. Demo crats believed he did not sign it because it was not radical enough. Wall Street tw be did not sign it because he ed not. Thus he played fast and c, blew hot and cold. Democrats ;ed on him as a great tariff reform Republicans I °w he was with m heart and soul on the currency, and that tariff legislation would be sidetracked. Thus Wall Street drew the chestnuts from the fire with Dem ocratic paws. It got what no Repub lican president at that day could have given them, a demouetizition of sil ver. Now we hear that silver is dead, Just as we hear that the tariff is dead, but both statements are untrue. They I have met the fate accorded anybody or anything which stands in the way of the money power of tbe nation, and tthat extent are dead. They met ; what Cleveland met, just what r old Senator Thurman met be se he dared attempt to prevent the! refunding of the Union Pacific bonds and avoid a gigantic steal. Just what Harrison met when he would not be come the pliant tool the money power wanted him to be. Just what Wm. E. Chandler recently met wh sn he show ed up tbe nefarious workings of a cer railroad in his State. Just what Roosevelt will find awaiting him if be dares tread on the toes of the trusts Cleveland, the trusts own soul and body. If there was ever a drop of Democratic blood in his veins they have let it out. When he becomes the nominee of the Democrats many wil l seek shelter elsewhere. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, President Roosevel f 's message to Congress was read Tuesday. It is one of the most bulky documents ever sent to Congress by a President, and makes a pamphlet of forty six pages. The President begins his message by a recital of the assassination of Presi dent McKmley at Buffalo, calling at teution to the fact that he is the third jof the last seven elected Presidents to be killed. The circumstances of his murder, he declares, has "a peculiarly sinister significance." After a high tribute to the latej President and an exposition of the na-! ture of anarchy, he says: "I earnestly recommend to the Con j gress that in the exercise of its wise i discretion it should take into consid eration the coming to tuis country of anarchists or persons professing prin ciples hostile to all government and justifying the murder of those placed in authority. Such individuals as those I who not long ago gathered in open meeting to glorify the murder of King Humbert of Italy, perpetrate a crime, I and the law should ensure their rigor ous punishment. They and those like them should be kept out of this coun try; and if found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence tuey came; and far-reaching provision should be made for the pun- Baent of those who stay. No mat sails more urgently for the wisest lght of the Congress. Ie great prosperity of the nation is next subject treated of by the mes sage. In this connection it says: "The tremendous aud highly com plex industrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapidity du ring the latter half of the nineteenth century brings us face to face, at tbe beginning of the twentieth, with very serious social problems. The old laws, and the old customs, which had almost the binding force of law, were once I quite sufficient to regulate the accumu lation and distribution of wealth. Since the industrial changes which have so enormously increased the productive power of mankind they are no longer sufficient. The portion of Presidentßoosevelt's ! message dealing with what is known las the "trusts" is of pecliar interest. He says: | "An additional reason for caution in [dealing with corporations is to be found in the international commercial conditions of to-day. The same busi ness conditions which have produced the great aggregations of corporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors ir international commercial competition. Business concerns which have the largest means at their disposal aud are managed by the ablest men are naturally those which take the lead in the strife for commercial supremacy among the na tions of the world. America has only just begun to assume that command ing position in the international busi ness world which we beiieve will more and more be hers. It is of the utmost importance that this position be not jeopardized, especially at a time when the overflowing abundance of our own natural resources and the skill, busi- Eis energy, aud mechanical aptitude our people make foreign markets es itial. Under such conditions it would most unwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our Nation. "Moreover, it caunot too often be pointed out that to strike with ignor ant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably endangers the interests of all. The fundamental rule in our national life—the rule which underlies all others—ls that, on the whole, and in the long run, we shall go up or down together. There are ex ceptions; and in times of prosperity some will prosper far more, and in times of adversity some will suffer far more, than others, but speaking generally a period of good times means that all share more or less in them, and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater or less degree. It surely ought not to be necessary to enter into any proof of this statement; the mem ory of the lean years which began in 1893 is still vivid, and we can contrast them with the conditions in this very year which is now closing. Disaster to great business enterprises can never have its effect limited to the men at I top. It spreads throughout, and le it is bad for everybody, it is st for those farthest down. The talist may be shorn of his luxuries; the wage-worker may be deprived' ren bare necessities. The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance. Many of those who have made it their voca tion to denounce the great industrial combinations which are popularly, al though with technical inaccuracy, known as "trusts," appeal especially to hatred and fear. These are precise ly the two emotions, particularly when combined with ignorance, which unfit men for the exercise of cool and steady judgment. In facing new industrial conditions, the whole history of the world shows that legislation will gen eially be both unwise and ineffective! uuless undertaken after calm iuquirvl and with sober self restraint. j 'The first essential in determining I how to deal with the great industrial I c. mbinations is knowledge ot the facts -publicity. In theinterestof the pub lic, the Government should have the to inspect and examine the work ings of the great corporations engaged lv interstate business. Publicity is tie only sure remedy which we can 11.mv invoke. What further remedies ar j needed in the; way of governmental r< or t; nation, can only be a. cermined aft. i publicity has been oo ained, by process of law, and in the c. 'irseofa(..„i,istration. Thefirstre <!• isite is knowledge, full and complete - Kuowledge which may be made Dub ln to the world. tioiiß and joint stock or other associa tions, depending upon tbe statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper govern' mental supervision, and full and ac curate information as to their opera tions should bemade public regularly at reasonable intervals. The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in one State, always do business in many States, often doing very little business in the State where they are incorporat ed. There is utter lack of uniformity in the Stale laws about them; and as no State has any exclusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in prac tice proved impossible to get adequate regulation through State action. Therefore, in the interest of the whole people, the Nation should, without in terfering with the power of the States in the matter itself, also asssume pow er of supervision and regulation over ail corporations doing an interstate business. This is especially true where the corporation derives a portio:; of its wealth from the existence of some moiopolistic element or tendency in its business. There would be no hard ship in such supervision; banks are subject to it, and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed, it is probable that supervision of corporations by the Na tional (Government need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so conserava tive a Stute as Massachusetts, in or der to produce excellent results. On the tariff the message is emphatic, declaring there is general acquiesence in the present system. ; "iNouiiDg. ' says the President, could be more unwise than to disturb the business interests of the country by auy general tariff change at this time. Doubt, apprehension, uncertain ty are exactly what we most wish to avoid in the interest of our commer cial and material well-being. Our ex perience in the past has shown that sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt to produce conditions closely approach ing panic in the business world. Yet it is not only possible but eminently desirable, to combine with the stabili ty of our economic system a supple mentary system of reciprocal benefit I and obigation with other nations. Such I reciprocity is an incident and result of the firm establishment and preserva tion of our present economic policy. It was specially provided for in the present tariff law. "Reciprocity most be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first I ?'/ is t0 see that tne Protection grant ed by the tariff in every case where it is needed is maintained, and that reci procity be sought for so far as it can safely be done without injury to our home industries. Just how far this is most be determined according to the individual case, remembering always that every application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must nev er be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wage-worker is a prime consid eration of our entire policy of econo mic legislation. "SuDject to this proviso of the prop er protection necessary to our indus trial well-being at home, the principle of reciprocity must command our l.earty support. The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgen cy of the need for wider markets and for a liberal policy iv dealing with foreign nations. Whatever is merely petty and vexatious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in tbe long ruu, di rectly or indirectly, purchase those; surplus products by giving us some thing in return. Their ability to pur-1 chase our products should as far as i possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable us to take from them i those products which we can use with-1 out harm to our own industries and labor, or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us." The President closes this subject by commending to Congress the consid-1 eration of the reciprocity treaties of his predecessor. j Capt. David Bucher died on Friday morning last at the home of his son, Mr. M. W. Bucher near Churchville, after being confined to the borne for many months.
