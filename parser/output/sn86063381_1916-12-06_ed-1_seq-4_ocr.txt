M. D. A. Some seven years ago the Northern Minnesota Development association was organized in Bemidji. Today it is a healthy, progressive and aggres sive organization. The association has in a great measure carried out its high purpose, the development of Northern Minnesota. Tomorrow the association will hold its seventh annual meeting in Be midji. Hundreds of delegates from all sections of the state will be pres ent and matters of great interest and great importance will be discussed. This association represents 19 counties with an aggregate area of twenty million acres of landtwo fifths of the state of Minnesota. There has been some discussion in regard to distaontinuing the associa tion. Dame Rumor has come forth with the statement that this would probably be the last meeting. Stop! The delegates should not for a mo ment consider the disorganization of the association. The work is not doneit has just begun. Much re mains to be done for the betterment of conditions and the advancement of Northern Minnesota. The meeting will be held tomorrow because the agricultural area of Northern Min nesota is yet undeveloped. We hope that the matter of dis organization will not be considered at all. THE MESSAGE.
