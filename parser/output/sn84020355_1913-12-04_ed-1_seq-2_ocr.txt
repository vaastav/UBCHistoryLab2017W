MESSAGE President Wilson's first annual message to congress was one of the briefest documents of the kind ever submitted by a president. Its brevity, however, is not its chief recommendation. It is a scholarly document coucned in language that the ordinary citizen can under stand. Following are the most import ant points in the message: There is onlj one possible stand ard by which to determine contro versies between the United States and other Nations and that is com pounded in these two elements: Our own honor and our obliga tions to the peace of the world. We shall not, I believe, be ob liged to alter our policy of watch ful waiting; and then, when the end comes, we shall hope to see constitutional order restored in dis tressed Mexico by the concert and ?energy of such of her leaders as prefer the liberty of their people to their own ambition. What the farmers need and should obtain is legislation which will make their own abundant and substantial credit resources available as a foundation for joint, concerted local action in their own bebalf in getting the capital they must use. But we must not allow ourselves to depend upon extraordinary ex pedients. We must add the means by which the farmer may make his credit constantly and easily avail able and command when he will the capital by which to support and expand his business. Conscious of this backwardness and neglect on our part the Con gress recently authorized the crea tion of 8 special Commission to study the various systems of rural credit which have been put into operation in Europe, and this Com mission is already to report. Its report ought to make it easier for us to determine what methods will be best suited for our own far r. ers. ' The immediate services we owe the business communities of the country, is ?o prevent private monopoly more effectually than it has yet been prevented. This is a subject so manysided and so deserv ing of careful and discriminate dis cussion that I shall take the liberty of addressing you upon it in a special message at a later date than this. I feel confident that I do not misinterpret the wishes or the ex pectations of the country when I urge the prompt enactment of leg islation which will provide for pri mary elections throughout --the country at which voters of the sev eral parties may choose their nomi nees for the Presidency without the intervention of nominating con ventions. But in the Phillipines we must hold steadily in view their ultimate independence, snd we must move toward the time of that independ ence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations thought fully and permanently laid. Step by step we should extend and perfe t the systems of self-gov ernment in the islands, making test of them and modifying them as cx perien je discloses their success and their failures. At last, I hope and beli?ve, wc I are ftoing to gain the confidence of the Filipino peoples. By their coun sel and experience, rather than by 1 our own, we shall learn how best to i * serve them and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw our supervision. Let us once gain the path andsetout with firm ana con fident tread up< n it and we shall not wander from it or linger upon it. The people of Alaska should be given full Territorial form of gov enrment and Alaska, as a store house, should be unlocked. One key to it is a system of rail ways. Tnese the government should itself build and administer, and the ports and"terminals it should itself control in the interest of all who wish to use them for the ser vice and development of the coun try and its people. Our Bureau of Mines ought to be equipped and empowered to render even more effectual service than it renders now in improving the con ditions of mine labor and making ? he mines more economically pro ductive as wtll as more safe. Tr.e conservation of human life and en ergy lies even nearer to our inter est than preservation from waste or our Nation; 1 resources. We owe it in mere justice to the railway employes of the country, to provide for them a fair anil effect ive Employer's Liability Act. Soc ial justice comes first. Law is the machinery for its realization and is vital only as it expesees and cm bodies it. We ought to address ourselves among other things, to the prompt alleviation of the very unsafe, un just and burdensome conditions which now surround the employ ment of sailors and render it ex tremely difficult to obtain the ser vices of spirited and competent men such as every ship needs if it is to be safely handled and brought into port. 

CARE REQUIRED FOR THE WINDOW GARDEN Particular Attention Should Be Paid to Water and Shade for Plants. (By Li. M. BENNINGTON.) Pay Btrict attention to the potted plants as regards water and shade, for all plants require some shade dur ing summer, especially from the after noon sunshine See to It that plants intended for winter blooming are not allowed to bloom now. Pinch off the buds as they appear. Pots plunged in the border must be turned once a week to prevent the roots striking through the drainage hole. Now 1b the time for making cuttings of geraniums and the like. Keep the slips damp until well rooted; then pot. Keep ail buds pinched off until frost appears and kills outdoor flowers.

Seeds of pansies, lautanas, prim roses, impatient Sultana, and (he like must be sown now for winter bloom ing. If you never have seen the snap dragon of the present day, and want spikea of beauty a foot long to glad den the dark eyes of winter, sow seeds of the improved snapdragon. Kill Pocket Gophers.
