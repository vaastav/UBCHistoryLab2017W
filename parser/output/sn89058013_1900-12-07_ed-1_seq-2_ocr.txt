A prize of 1000 francs has been offered by a French society for the In vention of a glove. Manufacturers of kid gloves, however, are not likely to compote for the award, as the glove required Is one which will safeguard electrical workmen from accident, not adorn the hand of the American woman. The labor bureau of France shows that more than one-third of the in dustrial products of that country is the work of women. The American women have no large industrial pro duct to show, as only about 17 per cent, are employed In handicrafts of this sort, but happily their career has broadened into the most diverse paths of life, so that an exhibition of wom an's work in this country means much more than excellence in art industries. Affairs in Fersia are in .a deplorable condition and small revolts are break ing out in many cities that have been impoverished by robbery, which is legalized under the name of taxation. For several months the organization of a strong revolutionary force has teen going on, although there has been tranquillity on the surface. The cen tral committee of the revolutionists look to Russia for relief, and the Russian consul in Ispahan has been begged to Intercede for them with his government. The most remarkable feature of the Western states, through the com belt, in winter, lias been the interminable stretch of unused stalks, standing in the, snow, and liable in" the spring to be in the way1 of the plow. Thesa stalks do not easily rot, and there fore remain in the way of future Efforts of the agriculturist. They are Oiore than a dead waste, they are a hindrance. Millions of tons of this ijiaterial have been burned, or other wise lost to human welfare. The great agricultural discovery of the Closing years of the century is the fact that all this material can be util ised, every ounce of it The shredding machines slit it into fine fodder, which the farmers report Is not Only well relished by cattle, but is as good as clover hay for horses and costly mixed foods for cattle. It is not only fod from the fields, but is preserved in fcllos, and fod the whole year around. It is as good a food for sheep as for cattle, and lowers the cost of fatten ing these animals nearly one half. Shredded corn costs not above $2.73 per ton when stored. So the farmer i lias a new feed at half the cost of i bay, and almost unlimited in it? sup- ' plv. It is made of one of the wastes of the farm, at the same time convert- ! ing a nuisance into a blessing.

I r'F hti fyinr lit Ml Lei j MESSA As Read Before Congress at Hie Opening Session. SUMMARY OF SALIENT POINTS Document Deals at CJrcat Length With the Situation In China, The Philippines and Cuba. Vital Questions Fully Considered. The message of William McKinley, president of the United States of America, delivered to the last session of the fifty-sixth congrets Monday, contains more than 20,000 words and deals with questions of vital impor tance to 'the present administration and to the American people It is a document tersely written, full of de tail and emphatic in suggestion. The message deals principally with the Chinese situation, the future policy in the Philippines, the govern ment of Cuba, the building of the Nicaragua canal, a construction of a cable to Hawaii and Manila, the basis of a standing army, the extension of commercial relations with foreign countries, a suggestion to overthrow the trusts and a positive but liberal policy at home. Mr. McKinley urges the construc tion of better cable connection with foreign countries, better postal facili ties at home and abroad. lie roasts lynching and declares that punish ment to the guilty must be imposod by the courts and not by mobs. lie is opposed to the liquor trade in coun tries where the inhabitants are unciv ilized. He asks that sufficient protec tion be given alien citizens in the United States and that an indemnity be paid for the lynching of live Ital ians in Louisiana and the lynchers be punished, and that federal jurisdiction be given in such matters bo as to in sure the punishment of offenders against liberty and life and for the protection of foreigners sojourning within our borders. The message fully reviews the Chi nese muddle, giving a graphic ac count of the siege of the legation in Fekin and their memorable defense. He applauds the heroism of the Amer ican relieving force and reiterates that the United States is not at war with China and never has been. In dealing with the Chinese situation he suggests that the open door policy should figure and that sufficient guar antee of personal safety should be ex tended Americans in China. A considerable portion of the mes sage ia devoted to the Paris exposition and the good results accruing from the exhibits made by this country at the fair. The president is delighted that not withstanding the intricacies of the South African war, the friendship with Great Britain has never become es tranged and the United States and England are still enjoying the most cordial relations, with a future replete with promised continuance. The inter-ocean canal project meets with his hearty aonroval and h m. views the present situation in Nicara-' gua witn pleasure. Our relations with Spain, despite the late war, are cordial, and the president urges that the to it that peace and good will between ! me iwo countries is maintained in the future. Certain indemnities are rec ommended to be paid Spain. The government of the United States is still waiting for. the Saltan of Tur key to make adequate reparation for the Armenian outrages and the re building of the college at narpoot. The piesident is assured of the good will of Turkey, notwithstanding the present complications. The Buffalo exposition and the Mexican congress are given attention, and the general plan of displaying the resources of the government meets with the president's approval and en dorsement. Quite a portion of the message is de-! voieu io me expenses of the army and navy and figures are given showing a more economical administration of af fairs in these departments'. The refunding act, the president de clares, has greatly benefited the cir culation of our government. The imports and exports have ex ceeded by millions the records of the past. The president suggests the reduction of the war revenue and the upbuilding of American shipping. More attention is giveu to tho Phil ippine situation than any other subject " I'voiutui iuhj uuuijius ma policy in the east. F.e advocates a l.;b- j n' p ert)i,H!)t or tho IMipioon, de ohiiuig tho imtiou In miKCf.-Ub!o to lut'li. r eliientiun.

Philippines i to bo I roe, lint under tho direction and en forcement of tho United states. Tho Filipinos are to select their municipal and executive fileors, but they mtmt be loyul to the wirdies sad lawn of thii country. He suggests an extension of the nchool fncilini-s, with" free primary institutes and the lnption of a uni verml lutiguujir tii English lan guage. Tho law are to bo conserva tive, just and equitable; taxes nro not to be t xeoHsive an 1 no burdens are to bo indicted upon tho people which can bo avoided. The trcitty of Paris as to property rights taunt be upheld. In other word?, the policy ns out lined for the people of the Philippines will secure to tho nation tho advant ages of tho government of the United States, with all the rights and privi leges of Relf-govorumerit, just as soon as tho natives show themselves capa ble of governing themselves. The president's idea is that tho islands have been pacified, save for the guerilla warfare, aud he believes that an army of 13,000 natives will in a short time bring peace in all the group, w ill insure oafety to lives and property and will secure a vast increase in business. Until the islands are thoroughly pacified the military governor is the highest authority, acting under tho orders and jurisdiction of the Taft commission, but when peace is finally brought about a civil government must be administered. The message reviews at considera ble length the progresss that has been made in Cuba towards bringing about a self-government for the people. The president cites many instances to show that we are at peaoe with all tho world and that annually our corn men a 1 and our social relations are iucrettsiug in cordiality. Gradually the commerce of the United States with our South Ameri can neighbors is improving asd the future is replete with promies. An army of 00,000 men is recom mended, the president to be empowered to increase to 100,000 if emergency should demand. Within the last four years, GO,000, 000 have been paid for improved coast defenses, requiring an army of 26,000 men for garrison "duty. Tho message reviews the improving along this line and gives many interesting details of what has been accomplished. The progress made in the extension of the rural mail system aud the bet tering of the postal system meets with the approval of the president and he urges the congress not to neglect this important branch of the government. A civil service is promised the Fili pinos, under the Taft commission. A recommendation is made that all the heroic acts in both army and navy should be regarded and that tho ap preciation of the government should be shown individual members of the army and navy who have done valiant service; especially, to the volunteers who remained in the Philippine ser vice after their term of enlistment had expired. Pensions, too, are talked about, and the president expresses the desire that aged, maimed and infirm soldiers and seamen shall be supported liberally. Reference is made to the great strides Hawaii has- recently made and the president declares that peace and prosperity reigns on the island. He recommends the building of a cable to Hawaii, which, in time, is to be ex tended to Manila and to be owned and controlled exclusively by the United States. Attention is paid" the compilation of the United States census and liberal applause is given the census bureau for its faithful work. The agricultural statistics show a remarkable progress throughout the entire country. In closing the message, the presi dent urges that in this era of pros perity, we Bhould not become ex travagant, but should administer the affairs of the country economically and conservatively, cutting expendi tures wherever possible, but not to the detriment of the public good.
