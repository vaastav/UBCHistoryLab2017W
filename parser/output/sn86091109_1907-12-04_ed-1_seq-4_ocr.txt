WHERE THE SHOE FINCHES James Creelman, a famous news paper correspondent and successful magazine wfiter, says that one of the reasons for the financial trouble S> that a billion dollars is constantly loaned in New York on stocks held for speculative purposes, and that as stock speculators are notorious for being willing to pay exorbintant rates for money the cash is kept in New York to supply them with "chips" for their same. The law against usury does not apply to loans on stocks payable on demand, and when the tide sets In against them the speculators will pay almost any amount for ready cash rather than forfeit their seats fn the exchange and get out of the •ante. Mr. Creelman, a thoroughly sea soned New Yorker, joins hundreds of thousands of Westerners in be lieving that stock gambling is re sponsible for a large share of the country's financial woe. j CURRENCY QUESTION MOST UPPER The president's message is not ag gressive, neither it is reactionary.
