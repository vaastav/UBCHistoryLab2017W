C0NGBX8BXEN UiXlOCB TO KXl'LilN THEIR TOTE. One of tbo most prominent characteristics which marks the course of the members of Congress, espo . cially on the republican side, is a great anxiety to explain their vote on the Stevens resolution. All manner of reasons are given by them, but the nervousness and the { fear manifested by many of them that ne one will understand their explanation are really wonderful. It shows very plainly that they foci guilty, and are ashamed of their vote. But the record is there, and the undue haste manifested by the entire republican side more than counterbalances all explanations which they may now make. They rushed headlong into the trap set for them. The manner in which they acted gave it the appearance at least of being their honest convictions. But many of tbem now show very strong symptoms of being in a decidedly unpleasant frame of mind? a state of anxiety roprqpentcd better than any other way by the old maxim, "Marry in haste and you will repent at leisure."' They were in such a hurry to pass Stevens' resolution, and place themselves on record in favor of it, that they could not even stop to elect their officers in the usual form,^but, as boon as they secured their Speaker, put through all the others by resolution at once, fearing that the delay in balloting for each one separate would not giv^Iiem time to vote on Btet ens' resolution. Then, when that resolution was presented, the gag of the previous question was enforced, lest some one would say something against it, and thus . delay them in recording their votes. The rad icals like Stevens and Kelley were honest enough in all this , for they had examined the field and come to the conclusion that they must carry their point before the PreaMfcat's Message were read in Cdngress. i They gave it as their opinion publicly that they must strike the blow at the outset if they expected to accom plisb anything in opposition to the President s policy. what are we to ray of those members who bad every where proclaimed that they heartily endorsed Mr. John son's course? This is the class of men who have de ceived the people, and whom the people will ac constable. ' Am regards such men u Stevens, Relley, of Pesnsylrar Bla, Sumner and ? few others, they hsvc made do eflbrl to conceal their opposition to tha Presi dent's mode of reorganizing tha Southern states. They have, therefore, in supporting the resolu Uos, Dot carriad bat tbetr professed principles, and have reason la r^oice over tbalr aaay tribmpb and the ruaarkable gullibility of tboae republicans who hare auwBMd their endorsement of tha action of the Presi dost. It la thia latter ciaaa that are now ao conscience ?Makes that they art a&xloas to give to everybody their rsaanaa But it win take a long time for them to relieve ' l>? aalvaa or the otfinm of that record. An open and flask foe, who everywhere and on all oocaatooa an nounce* hla conviction of doty and acta upon it, ta always leaked upon aa honorable. To him la accorded tha vir tue of honest ' motives Bat be who proclaims his course and pledges hlmssif to stand by K, and then the moment that ha 1s pat to the test does tha very opposite, bo longer com stands respect or is given tha credit of honesty. This class Is to be found in large numbers among tha republicans in the House of Representatives. Who thsy are the people in each Congressional district ia the Hortb can tall by recalling the promise." of their rep re aentativee and comparing thorn with the vote on 8te vena' resolution on the fir at day of the session. what nun sTBvnrs nrw-ntn to acomnns bt nis 

JOIST COMIOTTn. i In order that the poaitiou In which many of the mem bers of Congress have placed themselves in regard to their former promises and pledgee may be understood, it Is necessary to look back to the motives that prompted Mr. 8terans Hi offering it It is well known that be has for two years past stren nously advocated treating the Southern States as ao many Territories, and favored universal and a sweeping confiscation, tha receipts to be applied to the payment of tha national debt Tins he has sdvocated in and out of Congress, and at the same time held that whenever tbe Mates in rebellion were again admitted to the Union they roust come In under organic acta after the same probation as new Territories? In other words, kept under Military or rather Territorial Governors until they had gone through a probationary period, and then Admitted, by special permission of Congress, nnder the restrictions and provisions which that body might pro '?)da. He opposed the admittance of any of the dela gates from tha States which had been in rebellion in tha Baltimore Convention for this reason. But he was de feated there Be opposed receiving the electoral votes cast for President from the same States last year, but, inasmuch as this made ao difference In the result, hewsa permitted to bass hla war. and there ws^no contest over ,that point of any moment in tha republican party. Mr. Btavaas is not like many of hla radical aseociatee-per swat that lbs Southern States shall be kept under military ruts. He at least privately advocates leaving Atom exclusively to civil law, bat that civil law to be ad VNBtstarsd IB a Territorial form only, precisely as all B*w Territories are governed, which woald give fnngrssa, Ja bia view, the same power over all sneatioaa arising iherels as that body bow bavs over the District of Oslo ss bia is M has always keen tha customer the ?sis?

' ?? ' mpvsi ^9 j ^ tfR*? offices in the States lately In rebellion; snd under their manipulation, backed by Congress and con fiscation, he wouldj humble them and place them >? a condition to be admitted to the Union at some future time. This, of course, places those States out of the Union. This is the correct view of Mr. Stevens' position, or, at least, as he has stated it to his friends in conver sation within the l?st ten days. He came to Congress with the determination to se cure the endorsement of those views by that body. On the Wednesday previous to the opening of the session he had a long interview with the President, and then took hold ground In opposition to the views and policy of the latter. He not only opposed and denounced the idea of pardoning the late rebels, but fhvored confiscation in tbo strongest terms; and, to show that there is no mis taking his opposition to the President, he said to him on that occasion that he (8tevens) did not believe that there was any person in Pennsylvania, outside of the office holders and a -few personal friends of their officials, that endorsed, or in the least approved, his (the President's) plan of reconstructing the South. That there was not an independent republican in the State in his (8tevens') be lief but that repudiated that policy. This Is Stevens' opinion, upon which be informed the President that bs should act Mr. Johnson appealed to him for harmony for the sake of the country, but Stevens would not i change his tone in the least. The only thing that he did | do in that interview inconsistent with the above ex- | presRion was to ask for the pardon of a friend. It is not yet known whether the President granted the pardon or not ras radical CAtrers. This Interview with the President took place on Wed nesday, the 30th day of November. On Friday, the 1st day of December, there was a caucus of a few radicals. At this caucus were Stevens and a majority of the Mis souri delegation in the Honse, with a few others from different sections of the country, the object being to have some mutual understanding as to their course, in order that they rotght concentrate their strength. At that caucus Mr. 8tevens related the substance of his state ment to the President, antf then told the gentlemen present that what they accomplished they would have to do in spite of the President; for he was wedded to bis own plan of reconstruction. During this meeting the Senate (was canvassed, and they came to the conclusion that a majority of that body was inclined to be conservative this year, or. as it was termed in radi cal syntax, " inclined to play the sycophant to Mr. John son.'1 Fears were manifested that tho Senate would ad mit some of the Southern Senators, and thus defeat their (the radical) programme. In order to prevent that they came to the conclusion that they must secure the sp pointmont ~bf a joint committee on reconstruction, to whom everything relating to the admission of the Southern representatives, and tho troatment of the Southern States, should be referred. The resolution ap pointing this committee should have some provisions which would prevent one bouse from admitting Southern representatives until the other bad come to the same decision. In this way it was thought that a chock oould be held over the Senate, and the admission or Southern Senators prevented. Some doubt was ex pressed by one or two present about getting a resolution of that kind through the Senate; but Stevens replied that it was the only mode that he could see to accomplish that object, and if they failed circumstances might pre sent Some other mode. But it was thought that if the party in the Houso presented an undivided front the Senate would not dare to reject it They would be afraid to array themselves against the House, for fear that some measures which they were interested in might be rejected in the latter body. It was agreed that this plan should be adopted, and Stevens was requested to present it to the Congressional caucus to be held on the floor of the House on Saturday evening. But this was not the only point settled then. AU agreed that It would not answer to allow the credentials of the Southern members to be referred in the usual way to the Committee on Elections, for the reason that if ;tbe matter took that direction some of the men elected from the South would get around the numbers and ingratiate themselves into their favor, and the first they would know, one clever fellow would be admitted from this locality, and another from that, and thus in effect defeat their plans, and carry out the policy of the President It was therefore agreed that the credentials should not be allowed to go to the Committee on Eloc^ns; if referred at all it must be to the joint committee on reconstruc tion. In order that tho proposition for a joint com mittee might be successful, the Importance of Its being api>olnted at the very ouening of Congress was impressed upon all present If it were delayed for a few day 5 they would probably, fail. What were done, said Stevens, must be done at tho very outset. They must endeavor to commit both houses to their pro gramme at the outset or they would be unabts to carry it through. Having once secured the passage of the reso lution in both houses, then, in order to prevent an? change of policy, it was agseed that s resolution should be put through declaring that there were no Southern States to lie represented; in other words, that there were no such States as North Carolina. Alabama, Georgia, Texas and Florida, or Tennessee. The latter State was especially mentioned to be treated the same as all others. This, in their opinion, would dispose of the question of credentials and remove ail further controversy on that point. The Joint committee would then be left without any embarrassments to mature its plan of reconstruction, the government of the Southern Territories, which the President claims as States, and tlx the period of their probation before tbey are admitted to ths Union, as well as enumerate the conditions of their resuming their rela tions. tb nconv cArors Ths foregoing statement embodies the substance of the proceedings of the first radical cancna Another caucus of the radicals was held on the following day at the rooms of Senator Pomeroy, of Kansas, In the mean time, however, the programme masked out a* ths brat gathering was submitted to Chief Jostles Chase, and it met his approval. The whole thing was gone over at Pomeroy's rooms, and retndorsed there. This meeting is Mid to have been exceedingly enthusiastic and larger than the first. They became so wild Id their radical doc trinca that aome of tboae present thought the majority would go crazy one expression uaed by a poraon there was that he began to think they would go through the roof of the house. At this meeting every person waa appointed a committee of one to go around and see that every radical member Of the house waa at the caucus, Id order that there might not be any failure to their securing the endorse ment of the programme by the general caonoa of the republicans, and thus get every republican member bound to Ita support as a party measure when It came before the Bouae on Monday. That wing ef the party were all there. The proposition waa presented by Ste vens, and referred to a committee constating of Stevens, of Pennsylvania; Raymond, of New Tort; Blaine, or i Maine; Spalding, of Ohio; Washburne, of Illinois, Payne, of Wisconsin, and Boutwell, of Massachusetts This furnished Raymond an opportunity to administer I a severe blow, If not to defeat 8t evens' programme ; but instead of that "be united In the report In favor of it, and It was unanimously reported back to the caucus, and adopted without debate, as a party measure Thus stevena not only carried bis point, but the radical programme adopted at their private caucus was put through with tbe pretended sup portent of tbe President advocating it Raymond wae used ap a tool to advance It. Stevena waa immediately, by reaolntion, directed to present it to the Bouse on tbe following Monday aa soon aa that body organised, which waa done, and it received tbe entire vote of the republicans In that body. These facta leave no doubt of the Intention of tbe movers of the reaolution, or of Rtevens' -object in offering It. It places the entire repub lican strength in the House or Representatives in an an tagonistic position to the Preeident, and It a direct and unequivocal attack upon his reorganisation policy as an nounced to the public in bis proclamation and speeches snd Message to Congrese Of tins there can be no doubt. Those Congressmen in tbe reeent elections who an nounced their approval of the President s policy have, therefore, gone back upon their promises and placed themselves on record in opposition to the President, nil hxhatc. The resolution still hangs Ore in tbe Senate. What will bo its fate in that body remains to be seen. Tbe extreme radicals declare that it will pass Other Sena tors say that it will not. Another class state that Ten nessee will lie excepted from its operation and paas In that shape; while others state that it will be modified so as to remove the > heck upon the action of tbe Senate by the House, and then pass. With these conflicting views of prominent Senators It is hard to predlot the rssull One thing is certain, the longer It is delayed the poorer Its chance for endorsement by that bodv. In the mean time Stevens is holding back his resolution, declaring that there is no Southern States to be represented await ing the action of the Senate on the proposition of a joint committee, in order that bis real plans may not be dis covered until that part, at least, Is accompliabed. aaAGTKm m tit* Horaa. A reaction has commenced in the House. T><a Presi dent's Message baa opened tbe eyes of many of the mem bers who voted for tbe joint Committee en Reoonatruc tion, and they begin to see their real position Hence their effort to explain their vote on that reaolution and the quaking exhibited in many quarters. Mr. Farna worth, of Illinois, on Wednesday, offered a reaolution, which in effect declared that the negro a?ldiera should have the privilege of suffrage. It being a joint resolu tion it required a suspension of the raise to Introduce it. Inasmuch aa Mr. Stevena secured a suspension of the rules without any trouble to Introduce bla resolution on the first day of the aeamon, Mr. ParnsworUi imagined that he would heve no trouble in accomplishing the aame thing oo his proposition. The motion to suspend the rules was made, but Instead of getting the entire vole of the party it only received forty ive off r mat We votes to sixty-eight againet. So much far one day a con sideration of tbe President's Message The republicaaa were no longer ready to suspend tbe rulea for every radi ? ai resolution. This is aa encenragiag sign. cities o* nra ramuTioii ammo me mrasuuw Some of Raymond's friends now ssaert that ho veted for Stevens' reaelutioo fer a Joint eoaaatiUee far the per poos of revenge aeon the President That state that about tea days before tbe comaneonemeat of tbe session be called upon the PreaideM *a reference to the Mew Teak Cue torn Mouse, bet eeeld get no aetwfhetlen ent el the President la regard le H, and haa taken thia course o?? ef revenoi It to aoasewhat de?%tful if there Is any ? mi thai, h it* mrm < he was prompted by the hope of ? position on rrritin committees, unless we take the other vi.^) thai be was led into a trap which be did not nnd> or kuow.tbe nature of. Tne latter, however, do"* not give him crdlt for his usual shrewdness. No '^jOrsou can blame Steven? for hie course, for he was consistent with his past re cord, and made no hesitation in proclaiming what he intended to do. Tbere was no disguise nor conceal ment about It on his part. He went to work deliberately to accomplish an object and has bean thus far kuctw ful. But with those who claimed to be against that policy, like Raymond and numerous others, tbere Is no excuse for their course. It is a deliberate swindle upon the public, a repudiation of their pledges ami a violation of the expressed wishes of the people. nrntnvisw hptwkkn tub prssidot and hkmtob ?ctuiml A rich interview took place between the President and Senator Sumner on the evening after the Message was read in Congress. It lasted for several hours. There were three or four persons present. Sumner is repre sented as having bean very nervous. Some of tboee present thought he would go into a fit at two or three different periods of tbe consultation. At any rate his a?, lion* Justified the application of the term of being a mo nomaniac in regard to the negro. Finding himaeir unable to move the President, he Anally broke out as follows-? "Mr. President, I notice that the white rebela down in Alabama and other localities in the South are talking very strong against tho Union, and denouncing it in strong terms; can you not do something to put estop to lt?r' The President coolly replied:? "I see, Mr. Sumner, that the white rebels in Boston are talking against the Onion. Can't you put a stop to it there? " This confused the Senator for a short time, bnt after twisting in his seat for a short time he again broke oat as follows:? "Mr. Johnson, tbe report* from the South show that the white rebels in almost every section am tnsultlng tbe freedmen. Don't you think that Congress ought to do something to correct this evil?'' The President, with a significant wink to the other gentlemon present, replied "Mr. Sumner, I notice by the papers that the white rebels in Cincinnati have been recently insulting white people tbere and knocking down one or two. Can't Congress do something to correct that evil?" It is needless to add that the stay of the Mi? rhusetts negro monomaniac at tbe White House waa of short duration after that thrust. A 

POWER HXLD BT THIC FXKUDSST. Members of Congress have all of ? sudden discovered that the President has the appointing power in his hands. They see that, with very row exceptions, the federal officeholders throughout the country, from the Cabinet down, are those appointed under President Lincoln's ad ministration. Already there is a wonderful uneasiness among tho members of the House who voted for Stovens' resolution. This fear will cause a great change in that body. The public may look for some grand political somersaults before the session termlnatea In order that this point may be understood I give the points of con versation which took place a day or two since between a high efficial and a republican member. Tbe member referred to was boasting bow he was going to oppose the President's policy, and that be did not care what Mr. Johnson did "Stop," says the official, "are you sure you are inde pendent of the President, and can sustain yourself at home if you oppose him? Your district is very close. " "What has the President to do with my district? The people elected me, and cxpect me to carry out thoir views. I represent them, not the President, and be can't affect me there." "But," adds the official, "how many postmasters have you in your district?" "That has nothing to do with it," replied tbe mem ber. "they are ail friends of mine. Besides, it is always underst<X)d that the Representative in Congress is entitled to those appointments for his friends. " "But," replied the official, "suppose that the Presi dent should tako it into his bead to remove all of your friends and appoint men in their place who wero friends of his and did not care anything about you, what then would be your position at home?" This opened the matter in a new light to the enthusi astic member. After a little hesitation ho asked in a tone showing that this was a new phase to the question, i "The President will not think of doing that, will be?" "I don't know," replies tbe official, "what the Preei I dent will do, or whether ho has thought of this matter. I only know what I would do if I were in bis place, and I th?< would be to remove everyone of your friends If ! you opposed tbe policy of my administration." "W? e? 11? well," dfsuled out tho member, "1 don't know but the President's policy is right, after all, and 1 think I will support htm.*' nUUDB. There have been several serenades to members and Seoators sine? the message was sent to Congress. They have been slatted, no doubt, for the purpose or drawing out tho members on (he points of tho Message. The first was given to General Banks He skipped the reor ganization portion of the Message -and never alluded to it at ^U? much to the -disappointment of the crowd. It was altogether different with Senator Morgan, from New York. He was serenaded on Wednesday night, and eame out with an unequlvocal*en<Iprsement of the whole Meesage. ?*. approved it in its length and breadth New York has, therefore, ou man iu (tin uaiioual Legis | laturo who represents the vllws of its citizens. 

CUSTOM BOPSS c/crcs. A meeting of tbe New York delegation wu held at Raymond's bouse, on Wednesday night, to consider tbe question of tbe Collecfcr of the Port or New York. Aliaut half of the republicans wero present. A general conver sation revealed the fact that a large majority of those present favored the appointment of Hon. Chauncey M. Pepew. Senator Harris finally moved that the New York delegation unite in recommending his appointment. Just at this moment Mr. Raymond announced that dinner I was ready and invited them all into an adjoining room, which shut off the vote ana left the question in state quo for the present. Mr. Pepew has sent to tbe State Department bis de clination of the appointment as Minister to Japan. This, therefore, leaves tbal office again open for some person who desires to take a journey to the last. Sows from tke South. Nsw Oat sajv, Pec. 9, 1M6.

Though Egypt within the past fifty years ha* tua'ie perceptible progress,' Its condition to dsy is auUtiag i? boast of. Agriculturally and in geographical position it baa too requisite* of a great Power, hut the great 0i*is cle to its development it its government The sr? of commerce, which will do doubt be the main instrument of regeneration, is already commencing to mak<* itself felt; but as yet only the surface has been affc<wd ami the greatest part of the resource* of the country have not yet been touched. The existing government or Egypt began in Mnham med All, who assumed the governorship In 1B0?I The lint act of his reign was the complete esttrmiauios of the Mameluke power, which had oppressed the peopt* since A. D. 1171. He neit organised and disciplined ait army and a fleet, after which bo bestowed mu<-h siten tion upon the man substantial element* of strength, such m the natural wealth of tho country. Agriculture *11 patronized ; the cultivation of lagir cane, indigo ar.<i cotton was introduced, canal* were dag, end everything promised a hopeful fotare. Bat here came in the evil elf ecu of the government Whatever may have be-n tho good intention! of the Governor, the ultimate aim* were self-aggrandizement end affluence. Instead of be ing a government for the general welfare of all lie sub jects, It was nothing more than a gigantic system of I* borforthe enrichment of the ruling power. *Tbe pen pie, their ilvee and their fortunee were all subservient to the will of a single man. The Governor built numerous manufactories in different parte of the country , but al lowed no competition, and forced the natives to wort in them ae slaves. But, ruinous aa this wee, the tyranny imposed upon the agricultural population was still more opprsasive. By a certain law the whole produce of the labors of this clam was repaired to be sold to the Gov ernor at a certain price, and the sam? parties jwere obliged, for their own consumption, to buy heck again the name supplies from the government depots, end st aa advanced rate. A system of commerce waajnaugurated, but only for the beneOt of the Governor. Schools ware founded, a certain number of yoang Egyptians were in structed In sn English education, telegraph* were built, the country was nswly divided, a civil law was pro Bounced and other profreeaive measaree were adopted, and though the benefits accrued to the reigning|powor the result* were not without some good to the people. In addltiou to bis Internal labors, Mohammed All also reaped no small amount or military Tglory. An army, commanded by bis adopted eon, Ibrahim Has ha. in 18X6, conquered Arabia, Nubia, Sennaar aiftl Kordofan, and aanexnd them to Egypt aa provinces. Afterwards the Egyptian forces assisted the Porte against Greet.* Mohammed All neit turned his arms against lh?" Purls himself, undertaking to conquer Syria and to bnlld up a new empire, of which Egypt should 'be the centre In 1A31 the Egyptlana had triumphed over the Turks, and the plans of the insurgent Governor wore about consum mated, when the Interference of European Powers com pelted him to allegiance, aud tho treaty of Klntsliia lim ited Mohammed All merely to the Vice Regency of 5*yne. In the following year the war broke out afresh, end the Turks were again conquered , the European Powers again Interposed, and raatored ilia Porte to his lost ascendancy. The treaty which followed is at present the arrangement which exists between Kgypt and the I'orto.
