IT is customary in trade to base comparative con ditions on the heaviest previous business year until a new record-breaker occurs, when that, in turn, it taken as the basis. These record-breaking years occur every now and then and are dispersed along the commercial highway of the country like so many mile stones, and are commemorative of exceptionally pros- perous times. For several years past the year 1892 has been the basis of comparison, as that year made • the best average up to the present time. But we are now told by those whose business is to collate com mercial statistics that hereafter 1898 will be the basic year. It seems rather odd to us in Califronia that 1808, which has been our "dry year," should have been the most prosperous in the country's history, but if we are to beheve the figures of the commercial statisticians, it has broken the record in the volume of trade, though it is behind other years in the plane of values. In other words, prices have been low, but the amount of business has been very large. If this be really true, it destroys the popular theory that war is destructive to business, for during four months of the year the United States was engaged in an expensive war with Spain. Indeed, it was observed throughout the whole course of the war that outside of Wall street the business of the country was hardly affected by the war, one way or the other, and The Call pointed out at the time that a foreigner might travel from one coast of the country to the other with out knowing that a war was in progress if he could be kept away from the newspapers. The foreign and internal trade of the nation went on as usual, and the people were as tranquil as a cow chewing her cud. A? the year goes out certain favorable conditions are apparent. The iron and steel trade are excited over the placing of orders for from 500.000 to 700,000 tons of steel rails — more than 25 per cent of the coun- try's annual production — at prices which, though not too satisfactory to manufacturers, indictate a stable cc ndition of the trade. The boot and shoe business is looking up, leather is steadier and hides are higher, and the early advent of winter in the South has caused a marked improvement in the cotton market. The exports of flour and wheat from Atlantic ports last week were 7,484,000 bushels, against 6,500,000 bushels for the same week last year. The lumber trade seems to be improving, and the recent advance in prices is maintained, while reports from the pro ducing districts show that the heavy output has been satisfactorily handled. The general jobbing trade of the country has been checked here and there by se vere storms, but this is transient and incidental to the season. . The sales of wool in November were 39,875, 000 pounds, against 34,122,000 for the same week last year, but they were effected only by concessions on the part of sellers. Manufacturers of woolen goods re port rather larger orders, and the general opinion is that the. 'wool trade has seen its worst days, though ho marked improvement in prices is looked for un til the present enormous stocks become materially re duced. The failures last week were 281, against 306 for the same week in 1897, while the record for the month of November is said to be the best in this re spect in the history of- the country, and shows a grati fying condition of financial soundness. The bank clearings continue to show a gain over those of last year, the increase last -\»eek being 15.8 per cent. The uncertainty connected with the Peace Commission unsettled Wall street during the early part of the week and led to some selling of our securities by for eign holders, but that was a mere passing cloud. On the whole the country seems to be going out of the year with flying colors. Locally there is little new. The lack of rain still hangs like a cloud over the State, and while last week's shower helped the pasturage in the northern part, the San Joaquin Valley and the southern portion of the Sta'e derived little benefit from it. Aslongasthe dry weather lasts the interior banks and merchants will be indisposed to advance seed to farmers, and this acts as a drawback to business generally. What the State needs more than anything else at the mo ment is a good soaking rain, and when it comes there will be a general unloosening of purse-strings all along the cqmmercial and .agricultural line. There is no contraction of credits anywhere, and money is in abundant supply at the regular rates of interest, but capitalists, both individual and corporate, are dis posed to go slowly until they are satisfied of favorable results from their advances. The tendency of prices during the past week was generally favorable, to ferjaie'rs. .. There was no decline i\\ any Article ofproduce^ and several advanced. There is very •little speculation St: -t.be foment, and business js proceeding on conservative and safe lines. Physicians among the volunteers seem to have no -remedy capable of- curing nostalgia THE 

WORK BEFORE CONGRESS. AS a rule comparatively little important legisla tion is undertaken at the short session of Con gress. That which is to be held this winter, however, may prove an exception to the rule. Cer tainly there are gr,eat issues to be ddeafl f with. The fact that the Senate is not fully under the. control of sound money men may prevent any attempt to enact a. currency reform bill, but with that exception there is hardly any important measure of needed legisla tion that might not be accomplished this winter. Some of these measures, like that providing for the construction of the Nicaragua canal, have been long before the public. Others like the proposed legisla tion for the promotion of American shipping have been given an increased importance by reason of the rapid expansion of our commerce, which is now car ried on in foreign ships. Still others, like the demand for the establishment of a parcels post, are new. All of them, however, are supported by a strong popular sentiment, and it is reasonable to expect that at least some of them will be provided for by .the legislation of the session. The action of Congress will undoubtedly be largely puided by the message of the President. It is re ported he will recommend an increase of the army and the navy, the construction of the Nicaragua canal, a careful consideration of th: policy to be adopted with regard to the government of Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines, but will not recom mend any financial reform at this time. While these reports are more or less authentic, they will not in any way detract from public eagerness to read the message itself. Mr. McKinley is a conser vative statesman, well fitted to direct the affairs of the nation at this critical juncture. It is still freshly re membered how he saved the country from committing the blunder of recognizing the so-called Cuban re public, and the people have, therefore, ample confi dence that his abilities and his patriotism will enable him to settle up all the issues and responsibilities growing out of the war with Spain without commit ting the United States to any policy adverse to its highest interests. ' . :, Certainly Congress assembles for its short session at a very critical period of our history. It is likely to be marked by debates o- the highest themes that can engage the attention of statesmen, for such will be those involved in devising a government for Hawaii and for the islands freed by our arms from Spanish tyranny. We shall see what our Senators and Representatives can s do with the great oppor tunity before them. NEW 

YORK BEATS LONDON. A HAPPY coincidence has brought it about that the year in which the United States first re vealed themselves* to other nations as a great world power of commanding naval and military pres tige should also be marked as the year when for the first time New York outranks London as a com mercial city. The commercial triumph is, in fact, the more surprising of the two. No one ever doubted that we could sweep the Spanish from the seas and drive them from the colonies they misgoverned, f bu^ it was not at all expected that the honor of being; the world's commercial metropolis would be shifted from London to New York before the year was over. The figures and reports on which the claim of New York for supremacy are based are official. Mr. Van derlip, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, is quoted as having said recently that the annual report of the Commissioner of Navigation would show the total value of London's trade in 1895 was $i,i23.59i;630t New York's showing for the same period was $803, 321,190. In the following year New York gained $137,980,338, while London advanced only about $27, 000,000. In 1897 the figures for New York were $976, 898,235, a decrease from the preceding year, while London showed another slight gain. But 1808 has proved a banner year. Exports of merchandise have advanced fully $450,000,000, a greater gain than has been shown by any preceding twelvemonth. Imports of merchandise have not advanced, but there have been heavy imports of gold to put the figures up. Al together New York's foreign trade for 1898 will not be less than $1,300,000,000, while that of London is computed at $1,202,207,847. Of course the contest will be close for some years to come, and the fortunes of trade will vary. London will be ahead one year, and New York another, but in the end the advantage of New York will be so great that mere temporary fluctuations and changes in the commercial world will not affect her supremacy. She will be in the near future what London has been for so many years of the past, the commercial metropolis of the world. It is safe to say that if ever New York loses the supremacy she has now attained the loss will be due tc the opening up of the Orient and the development of great commercial cities on the Pacific. San Fran cisco in this respect is the child of destiny. The in dustrial progress of the United States has brought the mercantile center of the earth to our Atlantic coast, and the progress made in the Far East may bring it to this coast at a time much earlier than is now expected. THE BRIGHT SIDE OF A BLIZZARD. RARELY has that vigorous and buoyant Ameri can optimism which with a "frolic welcome takes the sunshine and the storm" been better illustrated than in the comments of the New Yofk Mail and Express on the recent fearful storm that swept over the whole country from the Dakotas to the Atlantic coast. Our contemporary not only saw a bright side to the blizzard, but found it so radiant that it burst into a rhapsody of sparkling prose. The storm, it will be remembered, was one of the severest of recent years. Upon land and sea the de struction of property and the loss .of life were great. The Mail and Express itself describes it as "a grand all-star combination of cyclone and blizzard." One storm wind started from the south and the other from the far west. The two united in New Jersey,' and from there made a swift and terrible advance. Way farers caught in the blizzard were frozen on the high ways, many destitute persons died of the cold in their unwarmed tenements, and on the sea the number of wrecks was appalling. After viewing and reviewing all these disasters the Man and Express cheerfully advised its readers next morning after the storm to turn "from these distress ir.gr recitals to contemplate the beauty touches which the great cyclonic blizzard has given to the visible world." As an inducement to a study of these beauty touches the genial and irrepressible optimist said: "The storm king is a scenic painter of surpassing genius. With his airy brush and his wealth of wjiite he has given the outlines of castles and palaces and fairy dwellings to the monotonous structures reared by man. The trees, decked with feathery plumes and glittering icicles, are like giant flowers from some en chanted clime, and the distant hills loom skyward as if they were terraced banks of habitable clouds. All of which means that it was a royal storm, gorgeoifs and beautiful, fitly heralding the approach of the ex hilarating delights of winter." Californians will not begrudge the East such win THE SAINT FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1898. ter delights* and if the people there find them ex hilarating, so much the better. There is no accounting for tastes. We can hardly re frain from something of envy, however, for the cheerfulness of the happy liar who, after the passing of a blizzard, can rise up and swear that he likes it. Every American has the nerve to boast of the prevailing weather of his locality, and declare the climate to be unsurpassed, but they are few indeed who can survey the work of a winter blizzard and shout with rapture, "It was a royal storm, gorgeous and beautiful." WHATEVER ground a woman may have for complaining that her natural "rights" are de nied her, when she turns criminal the basis of her' logic fails. As a criminal she has privileges no male could think of claiming. She is apt to be re garded as a heroine. At least she arouses a maudlin sympathy and escapes punishment. As to her privi lege of slaying the man who may have wronged her, or have been simply her companion in evil, no serious question arises. ' There may be an arrest, a perfunc tory performance at court, which is merely a trial of patience and a waste of time. Under present condi tions in cities around the bay any woman may kill any man she feels an impulse to kill, and fear no penalty more serious than her conscience can mete out. In direct defense of her honor, as of her life, human judgment would sustain any woman if she slew her as sailant. No such circumstance has marked the numer ous murders committed here by women. Usually they have been cold-blooded, deliberate, and so without excuse, that, with the tragedy reversed, the woman the victim, the man the assassin, the gallows would have been the end for him. The plain citizen does not crave the probability of being eliminated from the material world even by the gentle hands celebrated for a natural tendency to rod: the cradle rather than press a trigger. Since the execution of Durrant, the monster who was hanged after a three years' fight, the law against murder has seemed in a degree effective. There has grown up a restraining habit of dropping thugs and killers through the trap, reforming the individual and making him useful as an example. No similarly be nign influence has been brought to bear upon the woman homicidally inclined. She has been taught that she has nothing to fear from any violence, and that a fit of hysteria and a gush of timely tears will wash away her guilt. This is not fair to either sex. If the Shattuck woman had been hanged, as she richly deserved, for luring Harry Poole into ambush and shooting him, the man-killing habit would not have taken so firm a hold upon femininity. But this woman, heartless, brutal and cunning, was not pun ished. On the contrary, the court permitted her to go, for the District Attorney, having convicted her once, saw the futility of undertaking the farcical pro ceeding again. Her sentence in the first place had been twenty-five years, yet there was not about her deed the first color of justification. The only woman who has been punished was Mrs. Worthingtcm. Pen niless, friendless, weak in mind and body, gpadefi to "the act by her Husband, she excited' no sympathy, ihe episode was not romantic nor the central figure a beauty with lachrymal founts on tap. She did not understand the science of applied hysterics. All the rest of the list have escaped. It is with no desire to appear harsh we call atten tion to the recent tragedy in which the bride of a month sought the presence of" her husband, Arst arm ing herself, and sent a bullet into his heart andanpther through his brain. She claims this was done in self defense. If it was, the fullest opportunity should be given her to prove it, and if it was not, if she sought this man with intent to kill him, the penalty should be as quick and as severe as it would have been for him had he slain her. The mocking of justice has continued too long, for the rustling of a skirt may mark the approach of an assassin as truly as may the stealthy tread of the midnight footpad. It is high time for the distinction to be wiped out. The bullets sped by the hand of a bride carried death with them. How is such a deed less black because not the work of a man? Whatever fate may have in store for this self created widow, it is certain that her career affords a dreadful lesson to foolish girls. She had been mar ried without parental consent. The husband was perhaps in many respects her equal, but he was in capable of providing for her, and this she knew. In order to marry she was forced to lead a double life, deceive her parents, and exist in a constant fear of exposure. A marriage which must be kept as secret as a thief keeps a robbery has in it no element of good, and the girl becoming a party to it is treading on dangerous ground along a path which can lead only to disgrace. There has as yet developed nothing to show that either mentally or physically the man was the stronger of the two. He did not seem as one who could in fatuate and beguile. In these illicit alliances the error cannot always be put upon the man, though for his share of it he dwells in trembling fear and goes to his grave. She has a share also. To hold her blame less h a grievous wrong. A girl who has the protection of a home does not need to be protected by a pistol. When she resorts to it, let the consequences be visited upon her. A gentleman who was killed while on a hunting trip it is now suspected shot himself deliberately, since it is discovered that his life was heavily insured. Needless to say, the insurance companies do the sus pecting. To the average judgment the good that money can do a dead man is hardly worth reaching after. Whether a woman has a right to kill a man who happens to have acquired her ill will has come to be a pressing question, and might as well be settled right now. A man may be imperfect and yet commit no capital offense, and a woman as executioner is out of her element anyhow. The Shenandoah arrived in port with a story of a meteor which had flashed flamiag across the sky. and a reporter recounted the yarn as a "long fiery tale." Perhaps he did not mean to do this, but either the scribe or the type machine was peculiarly honest. General Kitchener is being severely criticized for having put thousands of dervishes to the sword. When the critics can suggest a better use to which to employ dervishes their remarks will carry greater weight. Two people have been found guilty of extortion. As to what the capitalist from whom they extorted was guilty, of course the jury was not in a position to declare. Some of the big non-fighting fighters threaten to come West. If they wish they may come. There are some dreadful defects in the quarantine laws. When professionalism begins to invade football the gridiron would better be planted to cQrn and the ar tificial nose devoted to stage purposei alone* 

WOMON (\S A CRIMINAL. ENGLAND'S EDITORS IN DIRE DANGER. The Author of the Immortal Words, "Not Simply .Hoisted, but Nailed "Till Prosecute Them if They Say Anything Abouf^is Painful Old Con tract With the Southern Pacific. In this era of fraternity, when we are even talking of an alliance with the British, our cousins over the sea will surely permit us a laugh at their unconscious humor. They have heard there of the ''gale of the Examiner's good will to the Southern Pacific, and the subjoined excerpts from the Westminster Gazette Bhow how fully they have grasped the situation: The Exnminer and the San. Francisco Call have for many year? added to the gayety of the American press by their censelef* quarrtflings and bickerings. They are perpetually flying at .one another's throat and sometimes nno and then the other pets the upper hand. The Call is at present parformtng a. lively war dance on the body of its rival. It alleges to have upearjhed a very pretty piece of blackmail on the part of its rival, an. l its crowing is "particularly vociferous. It flecltfrea that "William R. TT'earst. the proprietor of the Examiner, was at one time promised $30,000 in Installments from the South Pacific Railway on the understanding- that he would from that time consult the interests of the railway and cease from all hostile criticism. This agreement was. signed in 1592 and for a time, according to The Call, the Ronth Parifte and the Examiner had a community of interests. Shortly after, however, the parties in this contract quarreled, and although the affair was arranged at the time, the evidence of the questionable transactions has now by some means passed into the hands of The Call, which is not slow to rake th? ashos nf an old scandal on the head of its rival. The text of the agreement has passed Into its hands and it :-. forthwith gives it in full as follows, under the title of "The Purchase of Heargt:" The company [Is to en.loy immunity from hostility tn th« oolumnß of the Examiner, andl Is not to be the victim of malicious attack or criticism, or of misrepresentation: that the Examiner will not seek to create hostile sentiment In the minds, of this" commun ity against the Southern Pacific Company, or any of the interests It represent*, and that while not stipulating as aralnst all criticism, it agrees that criticism Shall not proceed from any motive of malice or malignity, ami that- mich criticism as may he found neces sary to keep and maintain the confidence of the public to the- extent t{iat any public sen timent may have been created from Other sources, is to avoided as much p.s possible. Round the typewritten agreement, which purv>or+* to be a rough copy, are scribbled the comments of the managers of the Examiner. One of thorn agrees to the entire, document except a few w.prds in brackets. Another says that "cer tainly nothing else . would be satisfactory," whjle a third a,sks, "How does this conform to your understanding?" Although more than six years old the document is still a very pretty cudgel for one newspaper to belabor its rival with. Unfortunately the answer of the Examiner Is not to hand. Meanwhile The Call, with the view of slinging another bolt at its rival, has published photographs of what in American sjp.ng is. ca.^ed thQ Examiner's cold pig. This Is the colloquial expression, for the unsold returps p{ a newspaper, and the cartload in the cruel photograph is meant gently to convey that the Ex aminer has not such a big circulation after all. The fun came In where the editor took It all back. He recanted on the authority of Creelman, a correspondent whose aversion to the truth is paid for at space rates. Possibly Creelman could tell the truth, but Indubita bly he never does so. He was an accessory to the horrors of the war be tween China' and Japan, creating most of them himself and portraying with elaborate detail thrilling series' of events which never occurred. In Cuba he conducted the campaign, the presence of the officers being wholly super fluous and rather annoying. He was an eager target for Mauser bullets, and told with much elaboration the sensations of a brave man under fire. So when Creelman was Instructed to call upon the editor of the Gazette and to tell him what was what the editor Imitated Davy Crockett's coon. Creelman added this to universal joy: To the Editor of the Westminster Gazette— Dear Sir: There is not a word of truth In the statement published in your columns based upon the San Francis co Call's charge that the San Francisco Examiner had many years ago made an agreement with the Southern Pacific Railroad by which the proprietoror man agers of the Examiner were, in consideration of a payment of a sum of money, to refrain from hostile attacks on or criticism of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company. The whole story Is a pure falsehood uttered by the San Francisco Call, which is a mouthpiece of the Railroad Company, which now bitterly attacks the Examiner because the Examiner has for years maintained an ear nest anti-corporation attitude. This railond and its allied "trusts" on the Pacific Slope first sought to shield themselves from honest criticism by attempting to crush the Examiner. They supported the Examiner's rival, excluded the Ex aminer from the railroad trains, and exerted their Influence in every possible manner, public and private, to silence it. These facts" are well known in the United States, and are repeated here now simply to meet a statement calcu lated to deceive people in England who aro not familiar with American af fairs. The whole Pacific Slope has been for years in the grip of a corrupt and tyrannical corporate clique, headed by the Railroad Company, which has Inspired the attack to which you give eurrencv. The Examiner has led a pop ular uprising apainst this despotic system. The railroad and its accomplices failed in their efforts to crush the Examiner. They then tried to caiole it with advertising and favors. Failiner in this they are now trying: to discredit it. The Examiner is In no way affected by such an obviously false attack, and the conspirators have had to go a loner way from San Francisco to find a newspaper other than their willing organ willing to publish this stuff. The Examiner is brinsc iner a suit aprainst The Call for libel and Judgment is assured. I am instructed by cable by William R. Hearst, the proprietor of the Examiner, to deny specifically every part of the story printed in The Call, and to hold to strict accountability in the courts all persons who repeat it. Faithfully yours.
