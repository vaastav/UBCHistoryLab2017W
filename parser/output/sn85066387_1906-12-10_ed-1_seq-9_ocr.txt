NEWS OF THE LABOR WORLD EDITED BY The Jurisdictional dispute between the International Brewery . Workers' Union and the firemen and engineers is as fw from settlement as ever, not withstanding the action of the recent Minneapolis convention of the Ameri can Federation of Labor. The ruling of the federation that the Brewery Workers should recognize cards of en gineers md firemen employed in brew erlee is one that ,is likely to cause trouble. The Brewery Workers declare that they .will not stand by the de cision and that any attempt to force them to do so will bring on a bitter fight. ~The talk about a beer famine may become a reality." declared . a brewery worker the other day. ' "We •hall insist that the priority of the charter grafted us in 18S€ be recog nized and that no notice shall be taken of the chfirter granted to engineers and: firemen employed In breweries in IES7." The brewery workmen believe «J1 employes of a brewery should be under the Jurisdiction of their organ ization. '• _ • • ' • The Sonora, Railroad, which is ' the southern extension of the Southern Pacific system from Nogales, Ariz., to Guayass, state of Sonora, Mexico, is tied up as a. result of a strike, which had as Its object the release of an en gineer held a-t Hermosillo on a charge of manslaughter. The prisoner ran a passenger train which killed a Yaqul Indian while the latter was walking on. the track. At the preliminary hear ing the engineer was hew for trial in default of 55000 ball. By preconcerted arrangement all trains were pulled into Hermosillo and abandoned by the crews, which refused to move any train until the engineer -was released. No trainmen can be Induced to cross the line from Nogales to help break the strike. American Consul Wood of Nogales and Vice Consul Hostettor of Hermosillo are working on the matter. Washington and the City of Mexico have been consulted. It ie announced that the New York unions In the building trades under the arbitration agreement are calling conferences to prepare for. a conven tion of delegates from the trade asso ciations of employers in the Building Trades Employers' Association and the unions which will begin a week from today to consider the revision of the arbitration agreement. The conference is to be attended by three delegates from each trade association of em ployer* and each union under the agreement.. It., is said that the con ference .will have no effect oa.the tra-itr agreements as to -wages and con ditions between trade associations of employers and unions, some of which will not expire for two years. The arbitration agreement affects about thirty-flve unions with an aggregate membership of some SO.OOO. Carpenters' Union No. 483 wiH hold an election of officers tomorrow even ing at €77 McAllister street.

' The last regular meeting of the Al lied Provision Trades Council was held in the cooks' .- headquarters, 1834 Ellis street, with J. Vera in the chair. Sec retary M. P. Scott was installed. The delegate from the Waiters" Union re ported that business was good and that almost every restaurant and eating house in the city was working under union conditions. The accounts of Sec retary-Treasurer Julius Selmer "were found correct. The following unions are affiliated with the council: Wait ers, with a membership of 1300; cooks, 1000: cooks' helpers, 500; waitresses, €00; bartenders, 1000; brewery \u25a0workers, 7SO; beer bottlers, 600; bakers, 1000; butchers. 1000, and milkers, 1000. In all probability the sugar workers and the ice wagon drivers will shortly affiliate with the council. There are several other unions which are also thinking of joining. The regular meetings are held y the second and fourth Tues days m the month. AH delegates are requested to be present * at'the next meeting, as business of importance is to be discussed. H. G.

' One' thousand members of . the United Mine " Workers In Indiana have been expelled under a decree that all mem bers owing the . special . assessment on December 1- should not g«*t their work ing cards 1 for this month .- and should be summarily expelled. . The assess ment which"" these-, miners '.have refused to pay was levied June last, to re plenish the national , treasuiy. : drained during the suspension In ,: the spring. Each miner was assessed $2 and was to have thirty^ days In^ which to 'pay it. Many of the miners, who ."believe that an- increase ;in wages 'could -have been got by the "organization, refused to' pay the ' assessment. " ' The fight between the old and , new unions of New; York ..City.' plasterers, which has been going on for more' than a year and •which • has'caused numerous building strikes,; has' been settled. The old -unionris', known '-as; Local : No. 25. 0f the Journeymen;Plasterers'/^.lnterna tional Union-*": It! was- locked out : by the Building Trades Employers'/Association for refusing toj observe /^the* arbitration agreement. ". The . newi.union, T i known ; as the Journeymen 1 1 Plasterers' .Society, 1 was then * formed \u25a0 under^the; arbitration agreement. The, unions under, the ar bitration agreement supported; the. new union' and the trades outside" of the arbitration; agreement supported l Local No. 25- Work i was 'plentiful? and -there was a war of .strikes/, lndependentiem ployers encountering strikes no * matter O. M. 

BOYLE what union they. employed. There- was such a demand for men- that both as sociation and Independent were, anxious to see the flghtcorae to an, end. As an instance of. what'the m«n could earn : a member, of the \ old union stated that frequently, of " late he had made |70 a week by working overtime, and : that there were ; many plasterers earning ; from $50 to , J6O a week. 1< That is f ar' ; better than can . be done In San Francisco. Under the terms of settlement the new union', Is to be divided into two locals of '\u25a0[ the international union, each of which will receive a charter. The, locals will then belong to one international body: and recognize each. other's working cards. The International. Seamen's Union, which is holding Its annual' session ; in Boston, has voted to co-operate^ with the other seamen's unions of the world for mutual protection, and : it was ;also decided to : afflliate ' with the* Interna tional Transport Workers' Federation, which' has headquarters in Berlin The plan for the establishment of a home for indigent seamen on lines similar to the Union Printers' Home was not fa vored. •The regular monthly meeting of the Musicians' Union will be held next Thursday in Eagles'.

Is -being held before General Manager Peck.- Further meet ings will*be held' next week. T Neither eide is % disposed to talk of the matters under "consideration, other than to ex press the hope- that \u25a0 the result of the conference will - be * mutually ; satisfac tory. At the-Xew York City- headquarters of the New York and New: Jersey Metal Trades Association it Is stated that » the general strike of shipwrights in the yards of the members \u25a0 of ; the associa tion, which had been \u25a0 declared off ; un conditionally, is on again.- The original demands . of * the strikers : were [tor.-, ah advance In. wages; from $3.25 and $3.50 a day to a uniform rate of $4,* which was refused- on the ground "that' the state of ;trade'dld : not; warrant the In crease. . - ' INSURANCE SUITS FOR ILLINOIS The French-American .
