President Wilson's message read to the congress yesterday fully sustains his reputation for statesmanship, far sightedness, patriotism and lucidity of expression. With his exceptional I opportunities for ascertaining the ex 1 act facts as to the conditions devel oped by the great war and to forecast the results of the conflic t when it has finally ended, he brings the meaning of it all home to us. We are not pre pared to rise to the opportunity the situation has created for us because we are without a merchant marine worthy of the name, for one thing, while our resources have been locked up. Tho president's statement re garding this subject is brief but force ful. He says: "To speak plainly, we have grossly erred in the way in which we have stunted and hindered the develop ment of our merchant marine. And now, when we need ships, we have not got them. We have year after year debated, without end or conclu sion, the itoest policy to pursue with re gard to the use of the ores and for ests and water powers of our national domain in these rich states of the west, when we should have acted; and they are still locked up. The key is still turned upon them, the door shut fast at which thousands of vigorous men, full of initiative, knock clamorously for admittance. The water power of our navigable streams outside the national domain also, even in the eastern states, where we have worked and planned for genera tions, is still not used as it might be, because we will and we won't; be cause the laws we have made do not intelligently balance encouragement against restraint. We withhold by regulation." That portion of the message is worthy of serious consideration by all. Having called attention to the fact, the president strongly, but in few r words, recommends that the mistakes and omissions pointed out be reme died. Most admirable indeed is the presi dent's presentation of the subject of national defense. Extremists oh both sides of the question may dissent, but we believe that the great mass of the American people will be in full and perfect accord with his declarations. Equally sound are the views expressed upon the very important subject of national expenditures. Proper econo my, not niggardliness, but the avoid ance of extravagance, is what the ex ecutive urges as the correct policy to be adopted. The president's reference to peace will, because of conditions that pre vail, naturally attract much attention, and on that, too, we believe he has exactly interpreted the sentiment of the country. 

RUFUS B. THOMPSON. - When a man like Rufus B. Thomp son is called the community feel* that it has sustained a teal loss. He had taken part in laying the founda tions of this county, in its early set tlement, in its subsequent develop ment and his life was a part of its history. He died when he seemed at his best mentally and with his passing comes the thought that he sould have given many more years to the various activities in which he was interested. Mr. Thompson was a real pioneer when he came to this section of Montana and while other parts of the state had even then been de veloped quite fully and built up sub stantially, this was a virgin field. He was a conspicuous member of that thinning band of men who came in here nearly at the beginning of the real settlement of the country and was content to transformation of the country while continuing to do his riiare in the great work. The remaining mem bers of that band with whom Mr. Thompson was for so many years associated will especially regret his death. He could be stern when occasion demanded, but he was naturally a man of tho warmest sympathy with certain quaintness that gave a charm to his personcJity and always was recognized as one whose in fluence would be thrown upon the side of right and justice. THE LEWISTOWN PLAN. ___ . .. , .. . „ . „ An ag.tation is on at Helena for a commission form of government. Otli Montana cities also seem to be look g aro und for some sort of a change a( j m j n j S t ra tion methods. The trou with m08t of tlle m, perhaps all of them, is that the administration of these cities is still upon strict party lines. The parties go into the cam paign, fight it out with all the agencies known to political organizations, and then the mayor-elect finds that lie has take care of the party workers, while the aldermen have to do the same thing, and the result is not what should be. The mayor cannot reach out and select whoever he wants to head this or that department. The qualification of the individual is not the paramount thing, but partisan service overshadows everything else. In Helena objection is made to the increase in the cost of the commission government. We see it stated that such government there would cost from $10,000 to $15,000 per year more than at present. That is one of the stumbling blocks in the smaller cities. That there is a very marked gain in efficiency is conceded, but the ques tion is as to whether the town can af ford to pay the added cost of sucli ef ficiency. The smaller towns might take a leaf from Lewistown's book with profit For a good many years partisanship has been absolutely eliminated here The mayor may be a progressive, democrat, or a republican, but mayor lie is simply a business man who would no more try to conduct his administration along politcal lines than he would to conduct his store as a republican or democratic store, lias worked out well here—so well that we believe the people would stronglv oppose any return to the old partisan system. Another advantage is that, under the Lewistown plan, any business man can afford to assume the duties of of fice, while if he were forced to get in to a political fight for the place could not be induced to consider it. PRAISE DESERVED. Secretary Garrison's words praise of General Funston's work Vera Cruz are thoroughly deserved. The record made there by the United States troops and their commander during the seven months of the accu pation of the Mexican port is a high ly creditable chapter in the history of the army. To have gone into foreign city with arms in their hands maintained the authority of the Unit ed States and preserved perfect dis cipline among the men. and at the same time to have converted an cient pesthole into a model of clean liness. sanitation and outward dec ency in defiance of the habits of population, and finall> with its proval, was a performance that quired unusual qualities by those charge of the situation. -New York World. MONEY DOES NOT COUNT. Apparently the day has passed Montana when with a big pot money an election can be carried, certain candidate put over, or another deteated. The republican state central com mittee spent almost $12,000 in an tempt to defeat Congressmen Stout and Evans, and yet these men ceived the highest vote ever gistered in the state of Montana. Congressman Evans receiving 36,458 and Congressman Stout 34,925 votes. Tlie republican candidates received 25,323 and 25,632 votes respectively. Thus the votes cast for republican ! congressmen cost about 50 cents each J while those cast for the democrats cost less than 17 cents each. 1 The republican state committee spent over twice as much in an tempt to defeat the democratic gressmen as was expended by democrats to elect their candidates. The democrats spent their money for expenses of speakers. The publicans had no speakers, except young Mr. McCormick of Missoula, himself a candidate, and Fletcher Maddox, the Washington, D. C., torney who was brought out by old republican machine and entered in the race to beat Tom Stout. Considerable of the money expend ed by the republican committee wasted. It was money wasted send out the a ttack on Governor Stewart. It was out of place at time and while it did not do the bit of it DO YOU KNOW That a business acquaintance at a strong bank is an insur ance when times are hard, and that the best way to become acquainted is to carry an account at the bank and meet its of ficers in a business way? This bank considers that it is in honor bound to take care cf the legitimate needs of its customers and always endeavors to do so when the circumstances justify the extension of credits. Its regular customers come first. May we not number you among them? BANK OF FERGUS COUNTY Lewistown, Montana. Capital and Surplus, $500,000.00 as in ho committee and brought the party no results. Governor Stewart was not running, and the attack of the Mon ana Record, which was sent out broadcast over the state, was a fool ish and a most wasteful method of attemptlng to defeat the democratic ticket. Republican money does not seem to have much effect in Montana at the present time.—Helena pendent. Inde of at a dis the an dec the ap re in 

THAT WAR TAX. "I have paid my war tax, now bring on your war," is a delightful bit of humor which has been going the rounds of the republican press of the state, although it is rather to be doubted that the majority of the funny men have contributed very heartily to the federal treasury thus far, says the Billings Tribune. The war tax, so called, it is true, is necessitated by the existence or war in Europe, but that is as near as it warrants the term of "war tax." The practically complete suspension of imports due to the war, cut off our revenues derived from a tariff, consequently other means to secure revenues were necessitated. Had there been no tariff revisiof.. and tiad the Payne-Aldrich tariff been in full swing, there would have been just as great a deficit in revenues because there could not have been a single pound more of foreign goods imported. in of a com at re re each The necessity for a special tax arose because our federal govern ment relies largely upon tariff duties for its revenues and so long as this is the case so long will there exist chance that the revenues will be interfered with by causes which are altogether beyond our control. The American people are not dis posed to resort to a purely scientific method of taxation, that is to say taxation which shall be direct in its imposition, consequently we must re ly more or less upon duties upon im ports. If Europe sees fit to mix up into war and to quit sending us its goods, naturally we lose our reve nues, when we must resort to "war taxes." ROMANCE AND WAR. at con the re at the was to the gov did Comfortable folk in this comfortable land, accepting the war news each morning with a slight sense of bore dom. complain that "romance" has been taken out of soldiering, says the Chicago Tribune. Men now burrow like moles, wallow in Mud, and are killed as are miners in a mine ex plosion. The instruments of destruc tion are out of sight; the masses men are so enormous that the indi vidual, who is necessary to romance has lost not only importance but identity; nothing is presented to the eye or to the imagination but serpen tine writhings on or under the ground. This can be horrible, but it cannot romantic, in the opinico of comfort able folk who desire to take other folks' wars romantically. If by • romance, a word which has traveled so far from home that would not know its parents, is meant pictorial effects, the complainants may be right. In the east, in Poland, Galicia and East Prussia, whence little news comes, there may be a sweep, dash, and contact of masses which would thrill the pictorial sense much as it would horrify the humane; but in the west, where war has been described and photographed, it lacks pageantry. It is business, the business of commissary, the business of transpor tation. Romance, seeking something to fill the eye, asks for dragoons charging the cannon's mouth; cuirassi ers accepting the challenge of massed regiment. Pickett's charge klava, the cuirassiers at Waterloo, satisfied romance, Romance is for stav at home eii joyment and it is best satisfied with ancient vintages. There is nothing romantic, in the sense we are accept ing the word in the business of bat tie. There may be pageantry in the preparations for one. Until the busi ness begins there may lie pictorial grandeur. The primitive picture sense of men may be pleased, their i auricular delight in percussion may be satisfied by the drums, their eyes filled by the spectacle of heroism marching to its supreme effort. But there never was a ba:llcfield which was any more romantic than the stock yards. Battlefields, whether filled with the slit diaphragms of Roman short sword days, with the split skulls and lopped off arms of long sword days, or with the bodies of men bullet punc tured or torn by shrapnel, are reali ties as hideous as the worst concep tion of hell. They become romantic when the realism lias been forgotten. There may be pageantry in the return ol the conqueror, but there was none in fashion of his victory, the 01ll y romalltic war ! ^ T* In a truer sense of romance this is It is the first one which has not "bound itself to verisimilitude." A German taube | a mocking note to the Parisians has no relation to anything we ever knew as reality in warfare; a British aero plane penetrating 130 miles into Ger many, hidden in the clouds as seeking for important manufacturing works that it might destroy, has no such re lation; a submarine hunting in the channel for a British dreadnought is not among our verisimilitudes as yet. An aeroplane crippled, falls into the sea and its crew is taken off by submarine arising out of the sea; torpedo boat destroyer, itself de stroyed by an unseen force, has its crew rescued by a ship coming up from underneath the waves. Here in reality we go back to the unreal days of the god from the ma chine. Destruction conies from un seen forces. The god throws a bolt and the hero drops. The invisible it as the at death threatens or strikes. The Paris otif the Iliad lives again to be snatched cut of danger. Romance and war never were com panions until the war li st its reality, but. this war, in many of Us aspects, has yet to acquire a reality which we can accept or understand. BARNES-KING IS MAKING A VERY SATISFACTORY SHOWING RETURNS FOR NOVEMBER EX PECTED TO REACH FORTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS -- Tlie Barnes-King made a very isfactory showing during November, having shipped 2,421 ounces of bullion to the Denver mint. It is estimated that the return on this should be $41,-, 000. The ore tonnage amounted 5,035 tons, and on the estimate stated, this would give an average yield $8.14 per ton. The operations for No vember were thus about the most Isfactory since the Barnes-King qulred the North Moccasin. The full returns for October, just announced, give the amount at $31,029.13, a little better than the estimates. The officers and stockholders of Barnes-King are all very much pleased with the year's operations at Kendall, which have given better results than were anticipated. The company also owns the Piegan-Gloster mine at Marys ville, where a big mill is now being completed and within a short time should be adding its earnings to those from the Kendall property.
