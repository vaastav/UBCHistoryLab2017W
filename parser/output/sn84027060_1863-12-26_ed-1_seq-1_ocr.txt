Gen. Halleck's Review of the Op eratiotas in the Department or the Cumberland. While Gen. Grant was operating before Vicksburg, information, deemed reliable, was received from captured rebel corres pondence that large detachments were be ing drawn from Bragg's army to reinforce Johnston In Mississippi. Reinforcements were sent to Grant from other armies in the West, but Gen. Rosecrans' army was left intact, in order that he might take ad vantage of Bragg's diminished numbers, and drive him back into Georgia, and thus secure loyal East Tennessee from the vile hands of the rebels, an object which the Government has kept constantly in view from the beginning of the war. I there lore urged Gen. Rosecrans to take advan- -operate his force, moving from Kentucky to East Tennessee. For various reasops he pre ferred to postpone liis movement until the termination of the siege of "Vicksburg. Tn order to avoid any misuhderstanding of orders given to Gen. Rosecrans on this subject, I submit the following correspon dence MURFREESBORO', Tenn., 1 June 11th, 1803. Your dispatch of to-day is received. You remember I gave you as a necessary con dition of success,, an adequate cavalry force. Since that time I have not lost a moment in mounting our dismounted cav alry as fast as we could get horses. Not more than three hundred remain to be mounted. The 5th Iowa ordered up from Donelson, arrived to-day. The 1st Wis consin will be here by Saturday. My pre liminary Infantry movements have alrea dy been completed, and I am prepared to strike a blow that will tell. But to show you how differently things are viewed here, I called on my Corps and Division Com manders and Generals of Cavalry for ans wers in writing to the questions: First—From your best information, do you think the enemy materially weakened in our front? Second—Do you think this army can ad vance at this time with reasonable pros pect of fighting a great and successful bat tle Third—Do you think an advance advisa bleat this time? To the first, eleven answered No six Yes—to the extent of 10,000. The second, four Yes, with doubts thirteen No. To the third, not one Yes seventeen No. Not ony thinks an advance advisable un til Vickslmrg's fate is determined. Ad mitting these officers to have a reasonable share of military sagacity, courage and pa triotism, you perceive that there are gra ver and stronger reasons than probably appear at Washington for the attitude of this army. I therefore counsel caution and patience at headquarters. Better wait a little to get all we can ready to insure the best result. If, by so doing, we, per force of Provi dence, observe a great military maxim— not to risk two great and decisive battles at the same time—we might have cause to be thankful for it. At all events you see that, to expect success, I must have such thorough grounds that when I say "For ward," inv word will inspire conviction and confidence where both are now want ing. I should like to have vour sugges tion. W. S. ROSfcCRANN, Major General. To Major General H. W. HAL LECK, General-in-Chief. WASHINGTON, Jan. 12, GENERAL—Your telegram of yesterday is just received. I do not understand your application of the military maxim not to light two great battles at the same time. It will apply to a single army, but not to two armies acting independently of each other. Johnston and Bragg are act ing on interior lines between you and Grant, and it is lor their interest? not ours, that he should light at different times,so as to use the same force against both of you. It is for our interest to fight them if possi ble while divided. If you are not strong enough to fight Bragg with a part of his force absent, you will not be able to fight him after the affair at Yicksburg is over, and his troops return to vour front. There is another military maxim that "Councils of War never tight." If you say that you are not prepared to light Bragg, I shall not order you to do so, for the responsibility of fighting or refusing to fight, at a particular time or place, must rest upon the General in immediate com* mand. It cannot be shared by a Council of War, nor will the authorities here make you fight against your will. You ask me to counsel them to caution and patience.— I have done so very often, but after five or six months of inactivity, with your forces all the time diminishingand no hope of any immediate increase, you must not be surprised that their patience is prettv well exhausted. If you do not deem It prudent to mk a general battle with Bragg, why can you not harass him, or make such demonstrations as to prevent his sending more reinforcements to Johnston? 1 do not write this in a spirit of fault-finding, but to assure you that the prolonged inac tivity of so large an army in the field is causing much complaint and dissatisfac tion, not only in Washington, but through oat the country. Very respectfully your ob't serv't, li. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief. Maj. Gen. ROSECRANS, .Murfreesboro', Tenn. HEADQ'RS DEP'T OF THE CUMBERLAND, MVRFRKESBOBO,' June 21, 1863. GENERAL—In your favor of the 12tbinst., you say you do not see how the mlaxim of fighting two great battles at the same time, applies to the case of this army and Grant's. Looking at the matter practical ly, we and our opposing forces are so widely separated that!for Bragg to mate rially aid Johnston, he must abandon our front substantially, and then we can move to our ultimate work with more rapidity and less waste of material on natural ob stacles. If Grant is defeated, both forces will come' here, and then we ought to be near oar base. The same maxim that forbids, as you take it, a single army fight ing two great battles at the same time—by the way, a very awkward thing to do— would lorbid this nation's engaging all its forget} iu the Great West at the same time, ESTABLISHED BURLINGTON, SATURDAY, DECEMBER so as to leave it without a single reserve to stem the current of possible disaster. This is, I think, sustained by high military and political considerations. We ought to fight here if we have a strong prospect of winning a decisive battle over the opposing force, and upon this ground I shall act. I shall be careful not to risk our last reserve witliont strong ground to expect success W. S. ROSECRANS, Major-General. Major General H. W. HALLECK, General in-Chief. When Gen. Rosecrans finally determi ned to advance, he was permitted to select, without restriction, his own line of opera tions by which to reach Chattanooga. [Gen. Halleck here gives a brief state ment of Gen. Rosecrans' movement driv ing Bragg across the Tennessee River:] The first mountain barrier south of the Tennessee being successfully passed, Gen. Rosecrans decided to threaten the enemy's communication with his right while his center and left seized the gaps and the com manding points of the mountains in front. Gen. Crittenden's ret-onnoiscance on the 8th developed the fact that the enemy had evacuated Chattanooga on the day and night prevtous. While Gen. Crittenden's corps took peaceable pc session of Chatta nooga, the objective point of the campaign, Gen. Rosecrons, with the remainder of his army, pressed forward through the diffi cult passes tft the Lookout and Mission Mountains, apparently directing his march upon Lafayette and Rome. On ascertain ing these facts, and that Gen. Burnside was in possession of all East Tennessee above Chattanooga, and hearing that Lee was being rapidly reinforced on the Rapidan, it seemed probable that the enemy had de termined to concentrate his forces for the defence of Richmond, or a new invasion of the North. The slight resistance made by him in East Tennessee, and his abandon ment without defense of so important a position as Chattanooga, gave plausibility to the reports of spies and deserters from Lee's army, of reinforcements arriving there from Bragg. Fearing that Gen. Rosecrans' army might be"drawn too far into the mountains of Georgia, where it could not be supplied, and might be attacked before reinforce ments could reach it from Burnside, I sent him, on the lltli, the following tele gram: HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, Washington, I). C., Sept. 11,1863. Gen. Burnside telegraphs from Cumber land Gap that he holds all East Tennessee above Loudon, and also the gaps of the North Carolina mountains. A cavalry force is moving toward Athens to connect with you. After holding the mountain passes on the west of Dalton, or some other point on the railroad, to prevent the return of Bragg's army, it will be decided whether your army shall move further south into Georgia and Alabama. It is reported here by deserters that a part of Bragg's army is reinforcing Lee.— It is important that the truth of this should be ascertained as early as possible. H. W. HALLFCK, General-in-chief. Maj. Gen. ROSECRANS. Chattanooga. On the same day the following telegram was sent to Gen. 'Burnside: HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, D. C., Sep. 11,1863. I congratulate you on your success.— Hold the gap of the North Carolina moun tains, the line of the Holston River, or some other point, if there be one, to prevent access from Virginia, and connect with Gen. Rosecrans, at least with your cavalry. General Rosecrans will occupy Dalton or some other point on the railroad, to close all access^ from Atlanta, and also the moun tain passes in the West. This being done, it will be determined whether the movable force shall advance into Georgia and Ala bama, or into the Valley of Virginia and North Carolina. H. W. HALLECK,General-in-Chief. Maj. Gen, BURNSIDE, Cumberland Gap. On the 12th Gen. Bosecrans telegraphed that, although he was sufficiently strong for the enemy then on his front, there were indications that the enemy intended to turn his Hanks and cut oft'his "communications he therefore decided that Burnside should move down his infantry toward Chattanoo ga, on his left, and that Grant should cover the Tennessee River towards Wliitesburg, to prevent any raid on Nashville. He was of opinion that no troops had been sent from Bragg's army, but that Bragg was being reinforced by Loring from Mississip pi. On the night of the 18th Gen. Foster telegraphed from Fortress Monroe, that trains of cars had been heard running all the time, day and night, for the last thirty six hours, on the Petersburgand Richmond Road, evidently indicating a movement of troops in some direction, and on the morn ing of the 14th that Longstreet's corps was reported to^be'going South through North Carolina. General Meade had been di rected to ascertain, by giving battle if nec essary, whether any of Lee's forces had left. It was not until the 14th he could give me any information on this point, and then he telegraphed, "My judgment, formed on a variety of meager and conflicting testi mony, is that Lee's army has been reduced by Longstreet's corps, and perhaps by some regiments from Ewell's and Hill's." As soon as I received Gen. Rosecrans' and Gen. Foster's telegrams of the 12th and 13tb, I sent the following telegrams to Gen erals Burnside, Rosecrans, Hurlbut, Grant, and Sherman: HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 1 WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept. 13,1963. .It is important that all the available for ces of your command be rushed forward into East Tennessee. All your scattered forces should be concentrated there. So long as wa hold Tennessee, Kentucky is perfectly safe. Move down your infantry as rapidly as possible toward Chattanooga, to connect with Rosecrans. Bragg may merely hold the passes of the mountains to cover Atlanta, and move his main army through Northern Alabama, to reach the Tennessee River and turn RosecraW right and cut olf his supplies. In this case he will turn Chattanooga over to you and move to intercept Bragg. H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief. Maj. Gen. BURNSIDE, Knoxville. HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept. 3,1863. There is no intention of sending General Burnside into North Carolina. He is order ed to move down and connect with you.— Should the emerny attempt to turn your right flank through Alabama, Chattanooga should be turned over to Burnside and your army, or such part of it as may be re quired there, should move. to prevent Bragg froui re-entering Middle Tennessee. IIulbut will aid you all he can, but most of Grant's available force is west of the Mississippi. H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.' Major General ROSECRANS, Chattanooga -HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON,Sept.13,1863. I think from all accounts that Steele ip sufficiently strong. All your available y strong. force should be sent to Corinth and TUB cumbia, to operate against Bragg. Should he attempt to turn Rosecrans' right and recross the river into Tennessee, send to General Sherman at Yicksburg for rein­ forcements for this purpose. Gen. Grant, it is understood is sick in New Orleans. H. W. HALLECK, Major General HURLBUT, Memphis. HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept. 13,1863. It is quite possible that Bragg and John ston will move through Northern Alabama to Tennessee River to turn General Rose crans' right, and cut off his communica tions. All! of General Grant's available forces should be sent to Memphis, thence to Corinth and Tuscumbia, to co-operate, with Rosecrans, should the rebels attempt that movement. H. W. HALLECK. HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 1 WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept, 14,1863. Information received here indicates that Eart of Lee's forces have gone to Peters* urg. There are various suppositions for this. Some think it is intended to put down the Union feeling in North Carolina, others to make an attempt to capture Nor folk others again to threaten Norfolk, so as to compel us to land reinforcements there from the Army of the Potomac, and then to move rapidly against Meade. Such was the plan last spring, when Longstreet invested Suffolk. It will be well to strengthen Norfolk as much as possible, and to closely watch the enemy's move ments. I think he will soon strike a blow somewhere. H. W. HALLECK, Gen. Meade was urged to attack General Lee's army while in its present reduced condition, or at least prevent him from sending off any more detachments.' It seemed useless o send any more troops into East Tennessee or Georgia, on account of the impossibility to supplv them In a country which the'enemy had nearly -ex hausted. Gen. Burnside's army was on short rations, and that of the Cumberland inadequately supplied. Gen. Rosecrans had complained of his inadequate cavalry force, but the stables of his depots were over-crowded with animals, and the hors es of his artillery, cavalry and trains were dying in numbers for want of forage. As three separate armies were now to op erate in the same field, it seemed necessary to have a single commander in order to se cure a more perfect co-operation than had been obtained with the separate commands of Burnside and Rosecrans. Gen. Grant, by his distinguished services and superior rank to all the other Generals in the West, seemed entitled to this general command! But, unfortunately, he was at the time in New Orleans, unable to take the field.— Moreover, there was no telegraphic com munication with him, and the dispatches of the 13th, directed to him and Gen. Sher man, did not reach him until some days after their dates, thus delaying the move ments of Gen. Grant's forces from Vicks burg. Gen. Hurlbut, however, had moved the troops of his own corps, then in West Tennessee, with commendable prompt ness. These were to be replaced by reinforce ments from Steele's corps, in Arkansas, which also formed part of Gen. Grant's army. HeariDg nothing from Gen. Grant or Gen. Sherman's corps at Vicksburg, it was determined on the 23d to detach the 11th and 12Lh Corps from the Army of the Potomac and send them by rail, under the command of Gen. Hooker, to protect Gen. Rosecrans' line of communication from Bridgeport to Nashville. It was knqwn that these troops could not go immediately to the front. To send moro men to Chat tanooga, when those already there could not be fully supplied, would only increase the embarrassment, and probably cause the evacuation of that place. In other words, Hooker'B command was temporari ly performing the duties previously asign ed to the reinforcements ordered from Grant's army. [Here Gen. Halleck gives an account ef the battle of Chickamauga. concluding as follows:] Division after division was pushed for ward to resist the attacks of the enemy, when, according to Gen. Rosecrans' order, Gen. Wood overlooking the order to close up on Reynolds, supposed he was to sup port him by withdrawing from the front and passing in the rear of Gen. Brm .nan. vmi YJm-w Ysmwi General-in-Chief. General-in-Chief. 

MAJOR GENERAL GRANT or MAJOR GEN ERAL SHERMAN, Vicksburg. On the 14th the following telegrams were sent to Generals Foster, Burnside and Hurlbut: Commander-in-Chief. Major General FOSTER,Fortress Monroe. HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept. 14,1663. Therearegood reasons why troops should be sent to assist General Rosecrans' right with all possible dispatch. Communicate with Sherman to assist you, and hurry for ward reinforcements aspreviously directed. H. W. HALLLOK, General-in-Chief. Major General HURLBUT, Memphis. HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 1 WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept. 14,1863. There are several reasons why you sho'd reinforce Rosecrans with all possible dis patch. It is believed that the enemy will concentrate to give him battle. You must be there to help him. W. H. HALLECK, General-in-Chief. Major General BURNSIDE, Knoxville. In addition to Gen. Burnside's general instructions, a number of dispatches of the same purport as the above were sent to him. Generals Schofield and Pope were directed to send forward to the Tennessee line every available man in their depart ments and the commanding officers in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky were ordered to make every possible exertion to secure Gen. Rosecrans' line of communications. •vj U F,, ,•'£*£. A 4»*4»/ condition of the battle but, with the true Instinct of the soldier, he had marched to the sound of tht cannon. General Thomas merely pointed out to him'the gap through which the enemy was deDouching, when, quick as thought., h'e threw upon it Steed man s brigade of cavalry. In the words of Gen. Rosecrans' report, "swift was the charge and terrible the conflict but the enemy was broken." A thousand of our brave men killed and wounded paid for its possession but we held the Gap. Two di visions of Longstreet's corps confronted the position. Determined to take it they successively came to theassanlt. A bat tery of six guns placed in the gorge, poured death and slaughter into them. They charged within a tew vards of the pieces, but our grape and canister, and the leaden hail of musketry, delivered in spar ing but terribly volleys from cartridges ta ken, in many instances, from the boxes of their fallen companions, was too much even for Longstreet's men. About sunset they made their last charge, when our men, being out of ammunition, moved on them with the bayonet, and they gave way to re turn no more. In the meantime, the ene my made repeated attempts to carry Gen. Thomas' position on the left and front, but were as often driven back with great loss. At nightfall the enemy fell back beyond the range of our artillery, leaving Thomas vie torious on his hard-fought field. As most of the corps of McCook and Crjttendepjwere now in Chattanooga, it was deemed advisable to withdraw the left in the hands of the enemy. He received a supply of ammunition, and during all the 21st offered battle to the enemy, but the at tack was not seriously renewed. On the night of the 21st he withdrew the remain der of his army within the defense of Chat tanooga. The enemy suffered severely in these battles, and on the night of the 20th was virtually defeated but being permitted to gather the trophies of the field on the 21st, he is entitled .to claim a victory, however barren in its results. His loss in killed, wounded and missing, as reported in rebel papers, was 18,000. Our loss in these battles was 1,644 killed, 6,272 wounded and 4,945 missing. If we add the loss of the cavalry in its several engagements, at about 5,000, we have a to tal of 16,351. We lost in material, 36 guns, 20 caissons, 8,450 small arms, and 5,S34 in fantry accoutrements. We captured 2,000 prisoners. After Gen. Rosecrans' retreat to Chatta nooga, he Withdrew his forces from the passes of Lookout Mountain, which cover ed his line of supplies from Bridgeport. THE NEW SPEAKER—SKETCH OF THE HON. SCHUYLER COLFAX.—The Honorable Schuyler Coll'ax, the newly elected Speaker of the United States House of Representa tives, was born in New York on the 23d of March, 1823. He [is a descendant of Gen'l Schuyler and Captain Colfax, both of Rev olutionary fame. At the age of thirteen be removed into Indiana, where he traveled much with the Hon. Mr. Lane, during his political canvass," and where he learned the trade of a printer. A widow's sou, a poor boy, he educated himself for a life of labor, and made up for his lack of collegiate tui tion by his perseverence and courage. About the year 1843 he became the pro prietor of the South ©end Register, and af tera short time was somewhat popular as an editor. In connection with Lis profes sion he took a very active part in the poli tics of Indiana, and in 1848, was appointed a delegate to the Whig National Conven tion of that year. During 1850, he was a member of the Indiana Constitutional Con vention, and in 1852 was again selected as a delegate to the Whig National Conven tion for the nomination of a President of the United States. He was elected a Representative in the Thirty-fourth United States Congress for the State of Indiana, during the year 1854, and was chosen from the Ninth District of State, succeeding the Hon. Norman Eddy. He took his seat on the 3d of December, 1855, and since that date has continued to hold his position as Representative of the Ninth District of Indiana. He was chosen during the sitting of the Thirty-fifth Con gress as the Chairman of the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, and held this office for two terms. He was also selected as one of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institute during the session of 1861-2 and still holds the position. On the 7th day of December, 1863, Mr. Colfax was elected, viva voce, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, obtaining nine votes over the number necessary to secure his election—viz: 101 out of 181, be ing twenty-one votes over all of his oppo nents. Mr. Colfax is a self-made man, who, by the force of his native powers, and in des pite of the want of a classical education, has raised himself to the high position which he now occupies. As a speaker he is plain, distinct, fluent and forcible. He is under the medium hight, rather slim and spare, large forehead, brown hair and eyes, pale face and good features. Capt. Willett, late of the steamer Chesa peake, captured by the "rebels on Sunday has arrived in New York with eight of his crew. He gives some interesting particu lars of the seizure of his vessel. Sixteen Southerners came to New York from Wil mington, yia Nassau, and remained quiet ly in a house in Jersey City for some days. On Saturday week, when the Chesapeake sailed for Poitland, eight of the men bought tickets for that place. It was no ticed that their trunks, which afterward 1 By this unfortunate mistake, a gap was opened in the line of battle, of which the enemy took instant advantage, and striking Davis in the flank and rear, threw his whole division into confusion. Gen. Wood claims that the orders he received were of snch a character as to leave him no option but to obey them in the manner be did Pouring in through this break in our line, the enemy cut off our right and right cen ter, and attacked Sheridan's division, which was advancing to support our left After gallant but fruitless efforts against this rebel torrent, he was compelled togive way, but afterward rallied a constuerable portion of his force, and by a circuitous route joined Gen. Thomas, who now iad to breast the tide of battle against the .whole rebel army. Our right and parf.Aof the center had been completely brohip, and fled in confusion from the field, mwtrying with tbem to Chattanooga their co^nnancf ers, Generals McCook and Crittenden and also General Rosecrans, who was it that part of the line. His Chief of StafiL Gen. Garfield, however, made his way to the left and joined Gen. Thomas, whostill re mained immovable in his position^ His ranks had assumed a crescent fofcn, with its flanks supported by the lower spuiji of the mountain here, like a lioa at bay, he repulsed the terrible assaults of Lift ea«uiy. About 8:30 P. M., the enemy diinowed a gap in the hills in the rear of his right ifcp' rhps and Longstreet commenced pourrtig massive column through the opening. Major General Gordou Granger, Vhofcad been posted with his reserves to cover our left and rear, arrived upon the field at this critical moment. He knew nothing of the were known to be filled with arms, were very heavy, but the men, who were poorly dressed, told the dock porters that they were too poor to hire men to carry their baggage, and so took it on board them selves. The remaining eight pirates came on board while the vessel was in the stream, paying their fare to the captain. Besides them there wereeight passengers on board. On Sunday night the pirates stationed themselves at the doors of all the state rooms occupied, overpowered the watch, and proclaimed the vessel a prize. The se cond engineer declared he would not run the steamer, and then fied to the upper deck. Several of the pirates followed him. He endeavored to resist, when he was fired at several times, and finally fell mortally wounded, dying in a few minutes. He was soon thrown overboard. The captain made his way on deck, and, refusing to surrender, was at once surrounded. He was fired at several times, but was not hit. Fights also took place between the pirates and the crew, but the latter were finally overpowered. The captain was then locked up in the wheel-house, the chief engineer shot in the chin and the second mate twice in the leg. In the morning the captain, subordinate officers and nearly all of the crew with six of the passengers were sept ashore. The pirates at an early hour dis tinguished an English pilot-boat sailing near them, and on it they forced the cap tain and others to embark. They, kept, howeyer, the chief engineer, Joseph John son, his assistant, Augustus Starbeck, and three firemen to work the steamer. A St. John (N. B.) paper says that the pirates were commanded by Henry Braine, and* Parr, one of the officers who escaped W''^, Morgan, was second. Cj»s«.V'I£l3U Important Decision in relation to Delinquent Taxes. The following decision of the Supreme Court of this State, is of so much impor tance to a large class of property holders that wef publish it in full: 

BARTRUFF V. REMKY. 1. RETROSPECTIVE STAUTES. That a stat ute was designed to be retrospective in its operations will not be implied when it does not relate to subjects which would render such a construction necessary from consid erations of public necessities. The general rule is, that whenever the intention to make it retrospective in its operation is not clearly expressed on its face, it will be con- s*fUa commence after its enactment. 2. SAME: REVENUE ACT. The Revenue act approved April 8th, 1862, [An act to amend chapter 45 of the revision of 1860, being an act in relation to Revenue.—Chap. 173, Laws of 1862] is not retrospective in its operation and penalties incurred before the taking effect thereof upon taxes delin quent when it went into operation should be assessed as prescribed by the law under which it was incurred. Appeal from Des Moines District Court. The facts are stated in the opinion of the Court. C. C. Nourse, for appellant. D. Rarer, for the appellee., LOWE, J.—This is (in amicable suit sub mitted upon an agreed statement of facts, which the court below is understood to have found for plaintiff, and defendent appeals. Bartruff is in arrears for taxes upon two lots Burlington for the years 1858, 1859, I860,1661, all of which become delinquent prior to the 1st of March, 1862. The defen dent being Treasurer of Des Moines coun ty, claims to collect the penalties provided by Sec. 18, of the Bession laws of 1862, page 288. Bartruff, the plaintiff, contends that said section and its penalties are prospec tive, and apply only to taxes becoming de linquent afterthe.passage therefore. The object of this proceeding is to obtain a judicial construction of the Revenue Sta tute of 1862, above referred to, and to de termine whether the same is retrospective so as to bring taxes delinquent prior to its -naetment within its penalties *. We remark, first, that there Is a class of cases or objects requiring legislative relief or assistance, in which it is not only com petent, but where from considerations of a controlling public necessity, it would seem to be the dictate of wisdom that the law making body should give to their enact ments a retrospective operation. Aside from this class of cases, within which the statute in question does not fall, the gener al tendency of the judicial mind has been and that, too, with great steadiness of pur- Eose,that both in England and this country, to old unless the retrospective intention of the Legislature is clearly expressed up on the face of the enactment, it shall be deemed to commence infutura. Now there is nothing in the Revenue Act approved April 8th, 1862, from which it can be rea sonably inferred that the General Assem bly meant it to operate retrospectively, and we are not at liberty, under the principle just stated, to give it that construction.— The Treasurer, therefore, of Des Moines county is not authorized to enforce the pen alties of this statute against tax-payers who became delinquent anterior to the time of its taking effect as a law. The submission in this case and the judgment of the court thereon, are both more or less implicit as it is claimed, and the last assignment charges that the court erred in not determining whether the plaintiff was liable to pay penalties for his default in the event the provisions of the act of 1862 were inapplicable, and we are asked not to leave this question open and unsettled Section 18 of the act of 1862 repeals the penalty on delinquent taxes contained in Sec. 760 of the Revision of 1860, subject, however, to the saving clauses of Sec. 29, of the Code, which read as follows: "The repeal of a statute does not revive a statute previously repealed, nor does such repeal affect any right which accrued, any duty imposed, any penalty incurred, nor any proceeding commenced, under and by virtue of the statute repealed." The provisions of this section continue the right to enforce the penalties that shall have accrued under repealed statutes so that it becomes the duty of the collector whenever a new Revenue Law is passed prospective in its operation according to Uie rule above suggested,changing the penalty upon delinquent taxes, to collect such penalties by virtue of the law under which they were incurred. This rule or construction makes the duty of county col lectors a plain one, and easily to be under stood by all parties interested, whilst it carries out the intent of the law-makers.— The judgment will be affirmed, but ren dered up in this court in such a form as fully to set forth the exposition herein giv en of the question presented.

Secret Object of Abe's Pretended Offer of, Amnesty— War to be Interminable—De' bate on the Message. WASHINGTON, Dec. 11,1868.—The readers of the ZTeroid have, ere this, perused the President's Message, and they will have seen that its general tone and prominent features were correctly foreshadowed in my letter of Nov. 27, I need not say toi tbem that I fully share the indignation which they will feel, in reading this atro cious paper It is a sad thing to see the Chief Magistrate of the Nation plowing to the winds his inauguration oath, trampling upon the Constitution, and striving to plant his heels upon the liberties of ten sovereign States. I take it for granted that the Her ald has already held up to the scorn of its readers those 'paragraphs of the Message in which his wanton parody of a President sets forth what has been agreed upon a& the settled policy of the Administration to wards the Southern States. Bad as it is to have one tyrant, it is infinitely worse to have half a dozen and this poor country is now in that category. Abrahatfi the First, is, by the grace of his Satanic Majesty, and by virtue of sundry acts of the'last Congress, abso lute monarch of these realms. But being weak both in mind and body, he b.as given himself up to the guidance of the. mounte bank Beeoher, Charles Sivannfcr, Horace Greeley, and four or tive of that stripy and they, now, are»rulers and the mas ters of the onee f'ee American people, ilt is they who h»\vo agreed upon thisatrociobs policy tow^is the South, and It Is in obe dience £heir behests that lanooln has insert'^'in his message. I need not say terms upon which Lincoln offers t'j receive the Southern people back into the Union, will be spit upon and rejected by the South, as in the highest degree in suiting to them. He treats tb'«?in as trai «JH- 

JUNE, 1839 tors, when it is he and his advisers, who are traitors to the constitution and to the country. He affects to consider the South ern States as existing no longer as having been taken out of the Union and destroyed, and the Southern State governments as no longer existing,—when every constitu tional lawyer knows that the acts of seces sion were null and void, that the Southern States are not now, and never were, out of the Union that the Union is unbroken and cannot be broken and that the only thing that interrupts the constitutional relations between some of the States on the one hand, and the Federal Government on the other, is the fact that a republican admin istration is in power. No one here believes that Mr. Lincoln makes this offer to the South in good faith, or with any idea that it will be accepted.— Nay, those who know him best say it was made in order that it might tie reject ed—in order that a new pretext might be found for a continuance of the war—in or der that the war may be invested with new features of ferocity, so that the people of the North and the people of tba South may still be further embittered towards each other—in order, in a word, that the present Administration may be enabled so to shape events as to retain their power for another term. There is one feature of the Message that is worthy of being dragged from the drea ry wilderness of yerbiage in which it is in vested because it exhibits at once the ma lignity of and the bitterness of the man who devised it. Abe knows that his ab surd plan will be rejected, and that the Union will never be restored in that way. Therefore he says in effect that it is possible that this Congress, or a subsequent .one. may repeat the obnoxious acts of the last Congress, and may call on-the President to revoke the Emancipation Proclamation.— These obnoxious acts out of the way, there might be a dawn of hope for the restora tion of the Union. But, says the heir of the aspirations of John Brown, I will nev er revoke or modify that proclamation, no never, never, 

NEVER. Let the readers of the Herald observe this point. No matter how conservative this Congress, or the Congress of 1866 may be. It they should both unite in removing out of the way ev ery stumbling block which lies in the way of a restoration of the Union, I will still keep that rock of offence in the way, even if I should be re-elected in 1864. Every intelligent reader of the Herald knows that if all these obnoxious acts were repealed, and a democratic administration elected, there would be a good prospect of restoring the Union, and yod now see the bait that this artful dodger holds out to the radicals. Elect me President for another term, says Abe, and although every other department of the government combined to bring the Southern States into the Union again, I, single-handed and alone, will keep them out. Look out for the debate on the message. It will be the liveliest, wittiest, spiciest, most fearless, most out-spoken, of any de bate ever yet held in the new capitol.
