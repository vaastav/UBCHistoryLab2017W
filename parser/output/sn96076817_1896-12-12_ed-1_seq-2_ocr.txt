Tha ap propriation for the last fiscal year amount ed to V'olM'J.CHi. 1'ritj estimate lor tht present JUcal year are about tl.0ou.0ou murt than was appropriated last year. The actual public domain Is now 1.SO.C72. VH acres. The public lands still vacant amount to over Co0.0uo.oco acres, not Includ ing Alaska. About bi.WJ.VA acres hav been patented to railroad, and thre are yet duo railroad and wusoii roads under thlr grants an agk'reeate ot lH.7atj.iiJ acres. Tho total acrvau segrcatta Moiu the public domain was Mti.2D.lUJ seres. The report suys: "These figures demon strate that the country Is being settled with great rapidity and that the public domain is l.lng diminished by great strides. It the rule of disposition ot the last 13 years, which 1 23.0OU.wO acres a year. Is contin ued for 13 years to come, there will le mtlo oi the public domain ouiaide of Aluuka in possession of the goverwuu til al tho ex piration of that time." lie urges legislation for the preservation of the forests, and states that a report wilt be submitted to congress by Hie lorestry commission, w hlch has iuitiy relui ncU from a tour ot Inspection. The Des Moines river land grant matter bus been udjusted. About lt3,hl4 In award was agreed upon, ot winch il7,C have been paid, and the lemuuiutr will l paid at the end of Uim year. Secretary Francis culls the attention of congress to the necessity of legislation look ing to the reclaiming ot arid IuiiUm, und aays that ot the Uio.uou.uoO acre of arid lands Iiai.uuO.IW acre might be reclaimed by tho consei vulive use ut wuur, nut u is impos sible under the laws In operation to control the reclamation of Hi" arid regions so as to prevent the Improvident use of water, over which the general government bus no con trol. This should be done by a system which constitutes tho rtuumallon ot the entire territories from u common source of supply and tho utilization ot that supply ur the adoption of the suggestion of the commissioner of the geiieii lunu olUcu would be a good one. That is, place tho lands in the uuect control of the states lor reclamation. No steps havo neen taken to make al lotments to tho Wichita ludluns, as tho act of congress left this to the discretion of the department. Itcgardlng the opening of whul is known as the leased district of the Choctaw and Chickusaw Indians, which Is now before tho court ot claims, he ssys that If the ulloimcnt were made and the balance of the land thrown open before u decision Is rendered upon the claim f the Choctuws and chlckasaws, the govern ment would bo placing tho Indians upon land under an agreement which Involved tho transivr of a good title and would also be throwing open the land to settlement when in point ot fuct It did not have a clear title thereto. He recommend! that ull tho Oklahoma townslte boards be abol ished. Hecrttary Francis la of the opin ion that the free use of timber on public Intids for commercial purposes should be discontinued. On the pension question he says that about 

K7J.C7S persons are drawing about mo.000.0uo per annum In pensions, and tho branch of tho service should be conducted with great care and discretion. He gives a table which shows that the total amount paid out by the government in pensions and the cost of disbursing the came dur ing the last 31 ycurs was J2.oat.S17.7Cy. which lacks only Sai0,712.25 of being equal to the high water mark of the Interest bearing public debt. He suggests u num ber of amendments of tho pension lawn, some of which have already been mad public (notably those In regard to pension ers resident In Germany). Ono hundred and forty million dollars Is thouRht to be sufllclcnt for the payment of pensions dur ing tho next fiscal year, unless pcnslors are Increased by further legislation. The secretary recommends that an lncreos? from eight to twelve dollars per month bo granted to all survivors of the Mexican war who are wholly disabled and destitute The Indians, he says, now occupy aloiu 

K'.OOO.OOO ucies of land, and they should te protected from the sinister machina tions of unscrupulous men. He recom mends that the Indian bureau should bi conducted by a commission of three mem bers, two to be civilians or dltTerent po litical parties, and one an army oilicer.

NAVY. Report of Kerretary Herbert and lit Iteconiuiendatlon. TV'sthtngton, Dec. 7 The secretary of the navy, Hilary A. Herbert, has made public his last annual report to the president on the affairs of his department. Tho docu ment. while affordlin; much ground for con gratulation. Is fiom beginning to end a warning to the country of the lnsufllicency of Its navy for the requirements of war. To show, however, the vast progress that has been made of late years, tho report be gins by quoting from the president's mes sage In December, 11&5, the following words: "We have not a single vessel of war that could keep the seas against a first-class vessel of any Important power." It quotes also from a former report of the secretary In which he pointed out tho dan ger of relying- on commerce-dcstroylnc cruisers as a protection In time of war. The Trench revolution and the recent civil war are cltod as Illustrations of the. fact that preyln? on a nation's commercial marine has no effect ou the course nor the results c! a war. The secretary's report shows that con gress has authorized the building of 23 vessels since this administration began. There were Ave battle ships, six light-draft gunboats, 16 torpedo boats and one sub marine torpedo boat, with a total displace ment of 65.&GO tons. During the adminis tration there will have been placed In com mission threo first-class and two second class battle ships, two armored cruiser, four doublo-turrclcd monitors and one harbor defense ram, a total of 12 armored vessels, with a displacement of M.U7 tons. In addition to these armored snips, eight cruisers and three gunboats will have re ceived their first commission, making a grand total fit 23 vessels, with an aggregate displacement of 1 1S.1M tons. During tho year eight vessels have been finished and accepted. Hut the report Intimates that notwith standing this Increase the navy of this country Is still Inadequate to cope with tha navul forco of the leuding powers tn the world. In proof of this It furnishes a table of the present and prospective strength of the seven principal navies Or eat lirltaln, France, Hussla, Italy, (Jermuny. Spain and the United htatcs. The secretary says: "It Is clear that the great powers with hlch wo are brought Into close relationship largely exceed ua not only in the number of buttle ships and torpedo boats actually In commission, but In their naval pro grammes for the future. The work of add ing to their strength In battle ships and toipedo boats goes on steadily from year to year. It Is not contended that woshoulj attempt to compete In numbers with tin grest navies of England and France, but we ought surely to move up steadily and continually Into a higher rank than that we now occupy, and Into the place of na tions whoso necessities are far Icps than ours. There are now not only In Kurope but In Asia strong and growing navita belonging to nations with which wo must always have the most Intimate and deli cate relations, and where our citizens are to be found In great numbers prosecuting their legitimate business. Our obligation and duties on this hemisphere are recog nized by tho world, and cuunot-bo met un less wo aro possessed of naval strength. If our merchant marine Increases as It should, and no doubt will, the present naval strength will be very far from what It should be. Nothing will so surely make for penco and give us weight abroud and se curity at home as a substantial navy con structed of the best materials and manned by the highest Intelligence and skill." The report shows 21 vessels, including seven torpedo boats and ono steam tug, under construction. The tug Is to be com pleted this month, and 14 others aro to be finished during lMff. There are 42 vessels In commission, with a total tonnage ot K'7.Wl tons. June 30 there were s.toi unlist ed men and 1,378 apprentices In the navy. Of tho enlisted men 72 per cent, are citizens, and hi per cent, of the apprentices are American born. The secretary urges an appropriation to enable the department .o eonveit boats In the merchant marine lnt war vessels In case or need. On this point he says: "The United States Is now paying subsi dies to a number of swift-sailing veasels which are capable of being converted Into useful men-of-war. Wo have many other naval resources tug, yachts and other vessels that could be fitted as torpedo boats; many vessels that could be adapted and used as gunboats, transports, cosl ships and repair ships, and we have thou sands of hardy and brave men accustomed to a seafaring life In our fishing fleets, coastwise trade and lake trade, but we have no law on the stututo books that would enable us to utilize. In case of emer gency, a single one of any class of thee vessels, or to call Into the service a ulngle sailor for the defense of tho country over j and above tho number allowed our regular navy tn case of liiivutefted or actual war. In the opinion of the depurtment such con ditions should not be allowed to continue, Naval wars hereafter will bo short, sharp and decisive. Whoever muy be called upon to consider the possibility of a sudden out brenk of wsr by tho United State, nny part of which is to be waged upon the high seas, will bo deeply Impressed with tne utter Inability of uny administration under th present laws to utilize promptly and efnclently, as we should be able to do, our naval resources." Considerable space Is given to a fnvorsM report on tho naval in 1 1 i t la. which has 3.319 members In 13 states. Naval oflicers agree that tho naval militia will bo a powerful adjunct for coast defense In case of war.
