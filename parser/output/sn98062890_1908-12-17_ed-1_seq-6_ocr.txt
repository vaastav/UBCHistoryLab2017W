The day had al most passed without sign or intima tion from the jury room, the hopes of Ruef and his attorneys had risen with every hour of delay and the ad herents of the prosecution were pro portionately discouraged. With num bers and interest undiminished, hun dreds of spectators retained their seats in the chamber or stood pa tiently in a long line opposite the en trance. The jurors had scarcely taken their seats in the box before the brief proceedings were at an end. The judge glanced at the verdict and handed it to Clerk Welch, who read it aloud.

Chicago, Dec. 13—The mystery of he "Knights of the White Death" letters, which were recently sent to various clergymen and prominent cit izens in this city with the threat that unless they left large sums of money at designated spots they would be put to death, was cleared up last night, when William Pollard, twenty two years old, driver of a grocer's wagon, was arrested and confessed to having sent the missives as a joke. When confronted by the postofflce of ficials, Pollard laid the blame on his having read Conan Dcyle's stories of crime. Fascinated by the novelist's lurid pictures of skulls, ghosts, grave yards and all-night vigils of detec tives, Pollard declared he had deter mined to see how they would work out in the hands of the Chicago po lice. So he organized the "Knights of the White Death," and with a Sher lock Holmes fancy for the weird, wrote out a bundle of letters, all deco rated with skulls and cross-bones. The demands for money, he said, were simply added to enliven the mystery, as he never went to see whether the money was left or not. Pollard was arrested at Evanston, a suburb. He was held in oustody pending further investigation. RISK OFFICIALS MAY ESCAPE. If Decision Freeing Tegeman Stands It Will Serve to Quash Indictments. New York, Dec. 13.—John R. Hege man, president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance company, was freed by the court yesterday in a decision that, if it stands, will serve to quash all indictments now outstanding against insurance officials. District Attorney Jerome, however, expects to take the present case to the court of appeals. Mr. Hegeman was charged with perjury in the verification of a report made by the Metropolitan Life In surance company to the superintend ent of insurance of the State of New York in January, 1905. The matter reached the appellate division of the supreme court through habeas corpus proceedings, and yesterday that court sustained the writ and dismissed fie geman from custody. The court in its opinion says that the evidence was insufficient to es tablish prima facie, wilful and delib erate perjury of Mr. Hegeman. On the contrary, there was enough to show satisfactorily that such wilful and deliberate perjury had been com mitted. CRY

ARMED FANATIC TERRORIZES TOWN "John the Baptist" Holds Up Merchants and Exchanges Shots With Posse. NABBED AND SENT TO ASYLUM Aiadman Races Through Streets With Gun, and Men, Women and Chil dren Seek Shelter. Edgewater, N. J., Dec. 13.—Pro claiming himself to be "John the Bap tist, come to save the world," an armed fanatic, wrought up to a high pitch of maniacal fury, terrorized this village for a full hour late yesterday, appearing suddenly on the main street waving a big revolver, holding up the proprietors of several stores, ex changing many shots with a hastily formed posse and at last being wound ed himself when the police and a mob of citizens ran him down. In all the fusillade no one was hit but the maniac himself, and his wounds are not regarded as dangerous. Like "Wild West" Exploit. Although the reign of terror the invader instituted was apparently based upon a religious impulse, his raid possessed well nigh all the fea tures of a "wild west" exploit. In the midst of the excitement the mad man commandeered a horse and wagon and struck a reckless gait out of town. It was from behind the im provised bulwark which he made of this vehicle when he alighted from it near the Palisades that he was finally picked by the shots of the pursuing posse. After he had been taken into cus tody, the man, gray whiskered and apparently about fifty-five years of age, said he was Oscar S. Pomeroy, that his home was in Nebraska, but that he had been an inmate of a pri- vate sanitarium in Stamford, Conn. Taken to Insane Asylum. When it was found that his wounds were slight he was ordered taken to the state asylum at Morris Plains, where he will be detained pending other proceedings. Pomeroy first made his appearance at Walsh's hotel, where he rushed into the kitchen flourishing his re volver and drove out the cook and the housekeeper. Then he returned to the street, and men, women and children fled to shelter as the mad man raced up and down the main thoroughfare shouting and firing whenever a head appeared. RIVER CONGRESS OVER.
