ON THE FIHST DAY OF JANUARY, 18S8, the county officials elected at the late elec tion will be sworn In as full-fledged public servants. The voters who by their suf frages placed these men In positions of Im portant public trust, expect at their hands a careful, wise and practical dispensation of matters pertaining to the public weal. In this they will not bo disappointed; hon est and capable, the new officials will rap Idly win a reputatlom for Integrity of put pose that cannot be questioned.

OROANIZATION KNOWN AS THE FED- cratlon of Labor threatens to supercede the Knights of Labor. It is said that al ready the membership of the former far exceeds that of the latter. The new or ganization, It is said, Is conducted on a more economical acd business-like basis; Innumerable officials, drawing large salar ies are to be unknown, cliques and rings will not be tolerated, and taken altogether the Federation of Labor promises much that Is good and necessary In tho way of a first-class labor organization. It will only be a matter of time when the special piiyilegcs for a few as against tlie Interest of tho many will be entirely eradi cated from tho social and economic con dition of tho American people. The soon er tho barons see this and regulate ac cordingly the better for all concerned. Tho "bucket shops," or one of the med iums of stock gambling carried tensiycly all over tho country and especially In large cities like Philadelphia, were raided and pretty thor oughly exterminated during the week by tho police authorities in Philadelphia. The betting on stock thus through these agen cies Is like poker playing; the only differ ence is that In the latter game the interest ed party holds his own cards while in the "bucket shops" Jsomebody else docs. Of the two poker Is the safest and most creditable. Coroner Ashbrldge by statistics proves that tho crltno of murder has doubled In the past year In Philadelphia. ITc ascribes this great increase to jealousy, Insanity and, whisky as a second. Crime is on the in crease and hardly a day passes in this great city that not some murder or stabbing and shooting affray is announced on account of some woman or viso versa. That is a big tunc that John L. Sullivan Is haying across the water with his 'nibs' his It. II., the Princo of Wales, and bis Ilk. Sporting circles In Philadelphia have been in high glco oyer Our John's recep tion and tho hit ho has made abroad. Sul livan is very popular in these circles hence the glee and enthusiasm manifested thereat. The Republican National Convun- tlon for 1883 hss been fixed for the 10th of June. The convention will assemble at Chicago, draft resolutions of party plat form and put in nomination men for stan dard bearers In the approaching presiden tial contest. It is not unlikely that James G. Blalno will head the ticket, with a pos sible New York State man for ylce presi dent. President Cleveland will bo re-nom- lnated with a western statesman for vice president by tho Democratic party. Tho platforms of the two organizations will differ only in regard to .tariff sentiments. There has been wore oit less talk of late regarding tho erection of a new courthouse; In view of such an cyent the citizens of Lehlghton will make a strenu ous effort to havo the budding located in this borough. The practicability, in case of success, cannot be disputed In faco of the fact that our population is rapidly In creasing, the variety of our manufacturing ance of ladies. industries constantly augmenting, our ac commodations second to none, and a' terri tory on which to build a ton n that would be a credit to the people as a county seat. When the time comes the citizens of this borough must move In this matter as one man. From WasMDEM: News Notes. Special to tho Carbon Advocate. Washington D. C, Dec. 12. Mil. EniTOiu The onenlnc of Congress, the meeting of tho National Republican Committee, and tho annual session of the American Kvangcll cal Ellance havo contributed to render tho past week a'mcmorabto one In tho history of Wash ington. Tho Associated Tress dispatches furn ished a graphic representation of tho scenes at the Capitol upon the opening day of the session, but they convey but a poor Idea of the keen sense of disappointment felt by tho crowds that filled the galleries long before Ihe hour of open ing, who anticipated witnessing exciting and animated proceedings. Tho questions with re frence to the seating of certain Senators had been amicably arranged In Joint caucus held du ring the morning, and, as no emergency arose, those who had struggled to get into tho crowded galleries, hardly felt recoiiqicnsed forthelrpalns. The opening scenes In the IIouso of Representa tives were not unlike those attending tho open ing day of a session. The doors of tho galleries were thrown open at an early hour, and spon cvey seat was occupied and the corridors were crowded. There was an unusally large attend- The floral gifts to tho Members dredc of new victims wcro taken In. It Is aston ishing to see whero these people come from and what thev rato for ut home. Au office was raided last week In which wore twenty female clerks, whoso sole business It was lo direct envelopes. Now, don't Jump at the conclusion that all these girls were aware of the nefarious business In which thoy wcro engaged, for they were not. They simply direct tho en' velopcs, tho enclosures were placed In tho en velopes In a private oftice by a confidential clerk and ono of the gang, and these enclosure stated that tho sender had a secret by which the re ceiver could make a pile of money w Ithout any risk, and Inviting correspondence. When an an swer was received, a icply Is sent staling that the sender has heard of tho receiver as a shrewd business man, and that he lias (in iiitlclc of green goods like tho cnelosd which ho will dlsposo of nt tho rate off ten for one, and ho cnelosesagood one dollar bill. Tho receiver looks at It, turns It over, examines It hi eery way, puts another one dollar besldo It, and on the closes, scrutiny can detect no difference; then ho takes It to the storo and passes It. Ills cupidity Is awakened visions ol untold wealth float before him wealth got by evil means, but never mind. It's money. Ho gathers all the cash he can lay his hands on, and keeping his secret locked up In his own breast starts for New York. There he Is met by a Rteerer; this person's business Is to steer the victim Into tho den of Ihe swindlers and keep him clear of the detectives that swarm about the cltv. Kvery detail of the trapping Is managed with the greatest caution, for there Is no telling but the victim may bo iv detecllvo in disguise, Tills delicate task Is all entrusted to the steerer, and ho Is expected to seo to It that thcro is no mishap between tho snaring of the dupe and his final robberv. Kvcntually, after repeated tests, he reaches the swindlers' den, and there the entire project Is laid before hlmi for 81,co ho can get $10,000; and for 810,000 a 100,000, and gemilno bills of various denominations are laid before Mm, ones, twos, fives, tens and hundreds; whatover bills ho may have on his person arc compared with the supposed coiuitcifelts and are found to correspond exactly, l'reqiienlly as high as twenty or thirty thons.ied dollars of gen uine bills are used In these audacious swindles. The sight of so much money usually turns the fouutrj man's head, and he Is ready to do any thing to get possession of it. Ho agrees to take S20,000,md tho money Is counted out before his eyes and put In a valise or package, and In older that the money may not be found on him ho Is advised tosend It home by express, and his new friend offers to accompany him to the express ofllcoto see the business propel ly done. The customer's attention Is attracted to tho window where a man appears to be watching tho house, and the Instant that his back lsiitrnod the valise Is changed through a secret panel by a confed erate In another room, and under tho pretence that tho officers may bo coming the dupe and his friend hurry out to thp express office where the valise Is checkedfor home. The fool follows It and on arrival rushes to the oxprcss ofllcoto get his treasure, only to find a vnllscfiill of brown paper or sometimes containing uclhlus but brick. After all tho exposes of this species of swindl ing it is as common In New York to-day as ever It was, and the police records show that all soits of people aro taken In by It. Only last week a man from tho West went to tho police headquar ters on Mulberry street to know If two men who had robber htm of fifteen hundred dollars could not be compelled to glvo it back. It took over two hours of close questioning to get from him the fact that had been the victim of the green. goods swindle, anil the humllltatlng portion of It was that ho was a merchant of repute In the town where ho lived and a prominent member of tho church. Tho rascals know very well when theyeetudtipeof that kluil they aro perfectly safe, as the man daro not prosecute for fear of bringing down ruin on himself. Inspector llyrncs has stated In this week to rid the city of these vermin; ho ran do it If ho will, and we are m hopes Ihat this cilv will no longer bedisgraced by these outlaws who thrive on tho criminal credulity of our country cousins, You will recollect that sevcial weeks ago, long before the Court of Appeals had reversed tho decision of tho Court below In the Sharpo case, I ventured tho prophecy that Jacob .Sharpc would never see tho Intitle of Sing Slug, and want you to remember what I said In mv letter the day after election, that Mr. Sharpe will never go to prison, and moreover, no Jury will ever be found again who will convict him. The fight has been a long and bitter one; It has been can rlcd on not only bcfoio tho Courts, but It has done more than this. It has entered Into our Municipal and State elections, and has estab lished this fact, that in tho prosecution of con splrators against tho government tho prosecu tion can go Just so far and no further. This re ularkable trial 'places Mr. llourkc Cockran at dill tm-sraiir poi'tor Pai k'T had taken seven hundred dollars of the fund subscribed by the cltlziMis ol Brooklyn for ihe r.whor monument. Brooklyn uiiilerstood Hint Hie eulogy dellvcrwl was a labor of friendship and love on Doctor Parker's part, and ns tho doctor hlmslf had made the public announcement that such wns tho fact, Brooklyn was very much astonished nnd shocked when It fniiinil out that tho Worthy doctor bad bagged seven hundred dollars ol the receipts. A howl went up from tho newspapers and aery from the ciillro city, and Major I'oud evclually returned nbout six hundred dollars of the nineteen hundred dollats tenllcd by the llcechcr eulogy, to which was added seven hun dred dollars presented by lawyer Sherman, one of Bccchcr's oldest and deares friends, making a total of $1,300. But tho doctor hung on to his seven hundred dollars. At last It was made so uncomfortnblo for him Hint ho asked for a pri vate meeting which was granted blin last Thurs day, at the house of tho Itev. John Hall of Brook lyn. The meeting was private, but Itvvas under stood that the explanations were of such a char acter that Doctor Parker was practically white washed, and the next day ho sent his check to tho monument committee for the seven hundred dollars of the monument fund which he had re ceived from Major Pond. The restitution evid ently did not sit well on the reverend doctor's capactlous stomach as he gave mortal offense lo the most eminent literary society of Brooklyn, treating them contemptuously, and substituting" without notice a bongo imkIkh of his own Instead ol his lecture on "Gladstone," for which ho was hnndsomely paid, lint all his offenses had been condoned by the return of the seven hundred dollars, and It was understooif that Plymouth Church would give him n parting reception. Ultt although Plymouth Church had forgiven Doctor Parker Doctor Parker had not forgiven Plyinuth Church, and he took the oceoslon ol his last appearance In that historic pulpit lo impress It on their memories. At the closing of the service he repented The Lord's Prayer, nnd when ho came 'to the lines "Forgive us our trespasses," there he made a long and ctnbrass pause, nnd Anally after an apparent stiuggle Mm ted out "A? we f rglve those who tiespass against us Amen 1" nnd rushed out of the church. Amazement sat on every countenance; If a dynamite bomb had dropped down tho midst ol the congregation It could scarcely have treated more astonishment and surpilso. Tho genllo Mr. Ilnllday, for years Mr, Ueechcr's assistant, pronounced tiio blessing, nnd tho congregation slowly departed shaking their heads and mumbling totlo voce such expression, as "lie won't do," "(Had he's gone," "Wish he hadn't come;" while one of tho more profane who stood next to him turned to his friend and said, "Jliii, he's a duffert an' -don't you forget It."
