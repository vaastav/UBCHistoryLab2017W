The application was made by Walter P. Horn of New York. whom, it is un derstood, acted for J. Pierpont Morgan. He is a creditor of both roads. No ob jection was raised by the defendants. the principal charges of insolvency be ing acknowledged. (iavr Itoutl. Mr. Harmon gave lond for $2ou.oo0 $lm.000 for each road.

NATIONAL PARK MOVE FOR ATLANTA. GEORGIA Battlefields Near That City to Be Set Aside as Military Burying Ground. A move-uieiit is on foot t.i inc. irp. irate the battle-field iiriiinl Atlanta, where fell so many brave soldiers of the1 con-feile-rae-y. and whe-re expired so many gallant men of the liiion. into a nation al military park, says a spe cial dispatch I from Atlanta to the St. Louis Republic. A bill has been introducee! iu con gress asking for le gislation ami earry Ir.g an appropriation of SotM"" for the purchase of the property, which in cludes the three battle-iie-lds around the city that of Peaehtrce cre-ek, fought July 2. lSeU; that of Atlanta, fought July and that of Kzi a church, fought July US. It is proposed not ouly to make parks out of the old tie-Ids. but to build boulevard- connecting all the fields. The improvements on the bat tlefields will le similar to those made ou the field.- of Manassas, Shi lob. Get tysburg. Vicksburg anil Chiekamauga. Since the battles around Atlanta were among the most important of the mili tary operations during the war. It would seiu natural that these fields should be next in order for considera tion. The battle of Atlanta was fought near what is now East Atlanta, in le Kalb county. With that battle? the campaign practically eude-d. The casu alties iu the battle on both sides were lOl.txK) men killed, captured and wounded. The battle determined the fall of the city of Atlanta on Sept. 2, 184, which later enabled Genera! Sher man auel General Grant to unite their forces after the fall of Fort Fisher. These events led up to the surrender of General Lee ami sett lent the fate of the confederacy. Military oieraticus around Atlanta make the fields worthy of leeiug pre-ete-rved as a matter of, historic interest. It is the plan of those behind the movement to have the three fields con nected!, by a great driveway. The driveway will probably pass through West End. Lakevlew. Fort McPhersou, Grant park. East Atlanta. Inman park, Ponce de Leon park. Piedmont park. and thence to Peachrree park, finally ending at Ezra church. The boulevard would run along the lines of military operation without eieviation. All along the lioulevard would le points of mili tary and historical interest. Members of the Grand Army f the Republic in Georgia have lent their sup port to the movement and are no less enthusiastic about the proposed park than the eoufederafe veteran. Fully Identified.
