A NEGRO'S FEARFUL PUNISHMENT FOR A FIENDISH CRIME DEATH PENALTY IN WORST FORM Iald for the Asnault and Murder of a Lady A Negro Taken From the Offi cers, Round to :i Trc and tiro of Faggots Built Around 111m - In Broad Daylight, Unmasked, a Crowd of Men .Execute Vengeance on a Fiend In the Outskirts of a Kentucky Town. Maysville, Ky., December 6. Rich, ard Coleman (colored), who confessed to the murder of Mrs. James Lash brook, wife of his employer, expiated his crime in daylight today at the hands of a mob, consisting of thou sands of citizens, by burning at the stake, after suffering indescribable torturing. The dreadful spectacle occurred on the peaceful cricket grounds on the outskirts of this city. Just two months ago Richard Cole man, the trusted employe of Farmer Jarnes Lashbrook, murdered the wo man who had been his benefactor. Coleman had been left in charge of the house. Mrs. Lashbrook had driven to Maysville and returned, when Coleman asked her to enter the cabin to look at some work at which he had been en gaged. The negro locked the door on the inside. Mrs. Lashbrook became frightened and screamed. Coleman struck her on the head, knocking her down, but not stopping her cries. He then seized a razor and cut her throat. He picked up the bleeding body and placed it on the bed. He then left the room, but returning, heard her still groaning, and with an axe he struck her repeatedly on the head until he was sure she was dead. The negro washed the blood from his hands and clothing and went to where Mr. Lash brook was at work in the field and told him that he had better come to the house, as some one had killed his wife. It was not until after the officers ar rived that suspicion was directed against Coleman. Bloodspots had been found on his clothing, but he account ed for that by saying that he had been killing chickens. That night, however, at Maysville, a partial confession was obtained, and, knowing the result if that fact should become known, the officers quietly took him to Covington, Ky., for safe keeping. lie was indict ed for the murder. Shortly after his incarceration at Covington he made a complete confession of his crime to the jailor. The story of his crime, includ ing worse than murder, was told with out any appearance of feeling by the prisoner. The trial was set for today. Sheriff Perrine determined to leave Covington by the train on the Chesapeake and Ohio, which started at 7:30 o'clock Wednesday morning from Cincinnati and Covington. Coleman had been ap prised Tuesday night to prepare to re turn to the scene of his crime. He was instantly stricken with fear and begged piteously to be permitted to remain In Covington until after his trial. He said he expected to die, but he dreaded the vengeance of a mob. When he, was handcuffed on leaving the jail in Cov ington he was almost paralyzed and had to be assisted to the patrol wagon. On enteiing the train he seemed un able to sit down until one of the guards forced him into a seat. It de veloped that in the crowd at Coving ton and even on the train there were some of the relatives of Mrs. Lash brook, icady to convey information if any attempt was made to secret the prisoner. Messages were sent here. The prisoner wit l his escort arrived at 10:20 o'clock. Sheriff Perrine, while en route to Maysville, had been in formed that a mob was awaiting the arrival of the train at the depot and he hastily prepared for the swearing in of deputy sheriffs. As the train pvlffed slowly into the old station the mob formed on both sides in two long huddled crowds. Armed men stationed themselves at the platforms of all the cars and warn ed the f. ihtened passengers to remain quiet and not to interfere. The sheriff and his assistants were strongly arm ed and theitf was some resistance as the leaders of the mob jostled roughly against them, and demands were utter ed from the outer fringes of the crowds for the prisoner. Sheriff Perrine made a bold movement and started walking swiftly, but with no indications of panic, from the car. A step behind him followed the officers with Coleman in their midst, seeking to conceal him self behind the brawny forms of his protectors. As the officers proceeded the num bers of the mob were constantly swell led by new arrivals and through the downtown business streets to the court house they were closely followed. Hun dreds of stones and other missiles were thrown md revolvers and rifles were freely displayed. The prisoner was fre quently struck and he presented a frightful appearance, the blood stream ing from wounds on his face and head. At tihe court house a mob of 2,000 men headed by James Lashbrook, the husband, had been hastiiy formed. A demand fiw the prisoner was made. There was a brief struggle in which weapons were hastily drawn by the of ficers, and sheriff and his assistants were overcome by force of nunvbers, and the prisoner was seized by the lead ers of the mob. The prisoner was dragged along by ropes loosely attached to his body. He was the target again of hundreds of missiles and several times he sank half conscious to .-the ground, while the crowd pressed forward, striking at him with clubs, sticks and whips, mtil his head and body were scarcely recogniz able. More dead than live, he was drag ged along and forced to his fet. Scor a of women joined the men. The wretch could be heard pleading for his life, but the cry of the prisoner was ans wered with an oath and a blow. The place of execution had been se lected weeks ago and all the other de tails of the programme mapped out by the leaders of the mob. The prisoner was strapped against a tree, facing the husband of the victim. Large quanti ties dry brush and larger bits of wood wore yluled around him while he was praying for speedy death. James Lashbrook, the husband of the Victim, applied the first match to the brushwood. A brother of the victim struck the second match. Some one with a krlfe was vainly slashing at the prisoner's chest. Not a single shot was fired. The purpose seemed bo be to give the wretch the greatest possible amount of torture. A fatal shot would have been murclful, and there was no mercy In the crowd1 surrbundlngf Ridhard Coleman. The ropes, securing him to the tree, were burned and his body finally fell forward on the burning pile. The crowd used rails and long poles to push his body back into the flames. It is not certain how, long life lasted. During the process, while his Voice could be heard, he begged fora drink of water. At the end of three hours the body was practically cremated. During all that time members of ; the family of Mrs. Lashbreok had remained to keep up the fire. In all the thousands who constituted the mob, there was uot a single effort made to disguise or conceal identity. No man wore a mask. All the leaders of the mob are well known and there are hundreds of witnesses who can tes tify to their participation in the trag edy. They are leading citizens in all lines of business and many are mem bers of churches. County Judge Harbeson "will em panel a special grand jury at once to make a speedy investigation and re turn indictments against the leaders of the 'mob. THE CORONER'S INQUEST. The coroner held an inquest on the charred remains of Richard Coleman and rendered the simple verdict: "Death at the hands of a mob." The body was left lying there and at present has not been removed. Relic hunters took away teeth and bones, and flesh and every fragment of the body that they could lay hands upon. All the afternoon children, some of whom not more than 6 years old, kept up the fires on the blackened body by throwing grass, kindling wood, brush, bits of boards and every thing combustible that they could gather. The action of the mob seems to be generally approved, even by women, who think that hereafter they will be safer. THE 

ROBERTS CASE. Mr. Tayler Talks of What the Commit tee Proceedings Will Be. Washington, December 6. Repre sentative Tayler, of Ohio, chairman of the spectial committee to investigate the case of Mr. Roberts, ot Utah, has cal'led a meeting of the committee for 11 o'clock tomorrow morning. Mr. Tayiler says this Initial meeting will be to determine upon a general line of action. He could not say how soon the committee wound be able to report, although Mr. Tayler expressed thd opinion that the inquiry would pro ceed with all due expedition, as the claimant was entitled to an early de cision. While the chairman would not speak for the committee he said he had no doubt that Mr. Roberts would be allowed to be present, with counsel, it he desired, and would be afforded the usual facilities to have his seat pres ented. There were a number of wit nesses in Washington and some in Utah, but iis it probable that the com mittee wiill not leave Washington, al though there are some precedents for extending an inquiry to other points. Mrt Tayler said the arguments in flection cases were usually open to the public, but he had some doubt as to whether the hearings, particularly such parts as involved family ' maitters, shouild be open. These details will be determined by the committee, Mr. Tay ler saying that the essential question was to secure a calm and unprejudiced consideration of the eligibility otf the claimant. Mr. Roberts was about t!he house during the day. There was no session, and he was engaged most of the time in chattings with groups of members and visitors, who showed a friendly disposition toward him. He said he had no comment to make on the course of the house. Tie wM probably look after his interests in person before the committee of inquiry- MORE INCREASE OF WAGES. Boston, Mass., December 6.

MESSAGE SATISFIES THE CUBANS Havana, December 6. President Mc- LKlnley's message to congress has been received by Cubans of all classes with much satisfaction. Even the leaders of the extreme party admit this and the announcement that there will be no American civil governor has cleared away most of the clouds thatt had been hanging over the Cuban political situ ation. The Lucha alone among the papers still favors a civil governorship. General Gollazo says: "The message will pacify the country. President Mc Kinley's statements are not very con crete, but if congress guarantees the independence of Cuba we need not ask for any specification as to the time for the removal of the American troops, although everybody would be glad to see the black troops go because of the excesses they commit.

State Hoard Hears Argument In Con tested County Cases. Frankfort, Ky., December 6. The state board of election commissioners, sitting as a contest board, spent the entire day hearing argument in the contested election matter. D. W. Far leigh, for the republican side, brought up the question that the board had no . right to go behind -the returns of the county canvassing boards. He claimed that no &taite in the union permitted such action, saying that the matter had been decided in all the court3 of the United States from the supreme court of the nation down. Commission er Ellis asked if the decisions did not show that the court of appeals had decided that canvassing boards had judicial power. Mr. Farleigh -then en tered a Iong argument designed . to prove that they did not. Judge Pryor, chairman of the com mission, spoke up during a pause in Mr. Farleigh's argument, saying: "I would like to Invite the atten tion of counsel on both sides to this proposition, and I would like to hear arguments upon it: Suppose this board does undertake to examine returns,' as the statutes say it shall have the pow er to do, how far does its power ex tend under the statutes?" There were several other speeches on both sides and the board adjourned for the day. A DIFFICULT TEST. One of the hardest tests given ap plicants who go before 'the civil service commission boards of examiners is in the form of printed matter which is to be copied without a single change, i't is said to be surprising to find how- many intelligent people find it imuos sible to properly stand this tcs-u They can irequenitly correct errors in lan guage which they cannot copy ver batim, says The Washington Stai. There was lately an applicant who showed his aptitude for this work. He was given a printed page and told to copy It. "Want ilt just like (this?" he asked. "Withouit achange," the examiner le- plied. The man labored. The printed mat ter was on a white sheet that was spot less with the exception -of a fly speck on one of its corners. The sheet the student had was Minus a blemish in that particular spot, but when it wa turned in there was a well-imitated fly speck. There was not a flaw in the work, and he received a rating on that portion of his examination, and today is one of ithe best and most trusted em- ployes in Ithe service of the commission, where he was detailed shortly after taking his examination. THE LION TAMER. Frau Hingstermjeler, the wife of Herr Hingstermeaer, the lion tamer, was what may be termed to put it mildly a virago, and held Hingstermeler in absolute subjection. The lion tamer returned to the family caravan one evening in a state of hilar ity, which made him feed that he would better postpone an interview with his better half until his condition had worn on. ie cnererore conciuaea not to sleep in the family quarters. The next morning his wife caliled him to account, and he explained that he had been having a little jollification and did not wish to disturb her slum bers on his return. "Where did you sleep?" she demand ed. "In the cage with the lions", here- plied, meekly. "Coward!" hissed Mrs. Hmgster meier, as of one robbed of her Just dues. Life. OUR ADVANCE IN PANAY. Manila, December 5. General Hughes now occupies Santa Barbara and Cabutuan, island of Panay, his lines extending thirty-five miles north of Hollo. He has occupied twenty towns. The inhabitants are returning with white flags, their fear of the Americans diminishing as they learn that they will be well treated. It is impossible to get the insurgents to fight. . They are retreating to the mountains and no more organized re sistance Is expected. The -artillery wagon mules are used for packing. Water buffaloes are also being used for this purpose. General Hughes con tinues advancing north and spreading his lines. A SCHOONER WRECKED. New Orleans, December 5.

A very Interesting case decided by the supreme court today Is that of McNeely, appellant, vs. Commissioners of j Morganton. affirmed. "Chapter 158. acts 1895, provided for a "local option" election to be held for Morganton on the first Monday in May, 18S5. and every two years thereafter, upon pe tition of one-third of the qualified vot er, and provided that "if at sale elec tion or any such subsequent election a majority of the votes cast should be In favor of "license" the commission ers of the tovn should be authorized to issue license for the sale of spirits ous liquors. Elections held in Mxj, 18J5 and 1897, resulted In a majonty for "license,!' and upon the result of such elections the plaintiff was twice granted license. Prior to the election in 185 prohibition law prevailed in the town. The election held on the first Monday in May, this year, upon pe tition of one-third of the qualified vot ers, resulted in a tie. Held, that the commissioners properly refused upon the result of such election to ,grant license for the sale of spirituous liqu ors. Elections held under the provis ions of the act, every two years, 'upon the first Monday in May" are legal, although such elections were not precisely two years apart. As act does not provide for new registration for each succeeding, election, the con tention that there was not sufficient time for registration, Is without merit. The most important case decided by the supreme court today is that of the State, appellant, Vs, the Southern Rail way Company, reversed. Judge. Clark writes the opinion and says: 'Where there is an appeal to the superior court from a trial upon in dictment in a criminal court the in dictments in both courts will be treat ed as separate counts in the same bill. and if either is good the court will support the verdict. "The charge in the indictment that the defendant, a common carrier, did give undue and unreasonable prefer ence to one by giving him "a free pass over the road of the defandant," is defective, in that it fails to allege that by virtue of such free pass the recipi ent received free transportation. It is the discrimination and not the method by which it is done which constitutes the offence. The allegation that a com mon carrier gave the person named undue preference by transporting him free, ex vi term!, alleges discrimina tion. Where the indictment against a common carrier charges undue prefer ence in transportation which is not within the exceptions named in the act creating the offence, a negative averment to that effect in the indict ment Is not necessary, but if the pref erence afforded does come within the statutory exceptions, such fact would be a matter in defence. Such indict ment need not charge that there were other persons upon the same train with the person to whom the discrimi nation was Riven, paying fare. It seems that a train load of 'deadheads is discrimination within the meaning of the statute. Chapter 320, laws 1891, was not repealed by Chapter 506, laws 1899, as was decided in Abbott vs. Bed- dingfield, at this term." Deadly Fight With Dispensary Con stables. Columbia, S. C, December 5.

Attorney General Griggs, in his annual report to congress, reviews. the work of the de partment during the year and then says , that application is occasionally made to uhe department of justice to have legal proceedings brought in the name of the United States against cor porations or combinations of companies that are alleged to be engaged In form ing or maintaining monopolies or agree ments in restraint of trade or competi tion. "Such actlocs," the attorney general says, "can b maita.ixi only when the offense comes within the scope erf the federal statute. The only federal leg- Is la t ion against combination tr re straint of trade is contained in the so-calted" Sherman act. "The Government has no constitu tional right to supervise, direct or In terfere with the transaction of ordi nary business by the people of the sev eral states unless such business relates directly and not Incidentally, to Inter state commerce, and such has been the decision of the supreme court of the United States. "In afil cases where the facts present ed to the attorney generaS, capable of legal proof, have established satisfac torily such an agreement or comnina- tion in restraint of inter-state com merce as is contemprated by the Sher man act, legal proceedings have been taken by him in the name of the United States either to dissofive the combina tion or to punish the offenders by in dictment." The attorney general recommends increase of sa'.aries of supreme court lustioe to $20,000 a year, of circuit court Judges to $10,000 a year and of the district judges to $,500 a year. 

PESTILENCE AND WAR Are Playing Havoc With th South American states. (Correspondence of Associated Press.) Kings-ton. Ja.. November Pas sengers from the west const of South America report an ominous ouilook in connection with the spread of the bu bonic plague. There seems little doubt that the epidemic is slowly, but stead ily working westward in South Amer ica. To this dangerous plague is added the general condition of political unrest in all-the western republics of South America. Chili is on the eve ' of a financial crisis, an 1 possibly of revolution, which has only been postponed, and not avert ed, by the government's reduction of the issue of forced paper currency from $50,000,000 to $20,000,000. In Peru and Bolivia serious revolu tions are going on. These are disorgan izing trade. Ecuador is in a condition of incipient revolt against the dictatorship of Pres ident Eloy Alfarc and a strong revo lutionary movement, directed by the clerical party and supported by a ma jority of the people, is said to be in course of organization on Peruvian soil. In Colombia civil war is raging. The plague and the wars are react ing seriously on trade, and industry. The most significant indication is the turning backward of the stream of English, German and other European commercial travellers. The coast trade,' thus far, has suffered little, but from Chili to Colombia internal trade is al most paralyzed, and the steamers are sailing with irttle or no return freight. Proposed Increase In Krelirht Kates. Atlanta, Ga., December 5. The state railroad commission today addressed to several railroads and the Southeast ern Freigiht Aesociation a letter touch ing on the proposed advance of 10 per cent, in coal rates. The letter makes no threats of action by UTie board if the rates are increased. but appeals to the managers concerned and points out why it would be unfort unate for an increase to be made at this time. It is shown that the advance In rates will probably injure new manufactur ing enterprises whiah are rapidly de veloping in the state and that any in jury to them would rebound on the roads.
