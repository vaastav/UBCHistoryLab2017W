2£he ^liddtctoicu transcript. CHARLES U. VANDERFORD, Editor. MIDDLETOWN, DEL. 8ATURDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 10, 1870. DIVISION OF NEW CASTLE COL'NTY. As Btepa have recently been taken to remove the county scat from the town of New Castle to Wilmington, and a com mittee appointed to memorialize the Leg islature ou the subject and to procure the consent of the Levy Court Commissioners and of the City Couucil of Wilmington, note is the time to agitate the subject of dividing the. county. The population is nearly G4.000, and the business before the Courts and the county officials gener ally ia too great for the public covenienco, ■and ought to be divided. Let the county 1>e divided on the line of the Christiana and White Clay creeks, aud let Middletown be made the county seat of the new coun ty. The new county would have n pop ulation of ubout 21 000, amply sufficient for all county purposes, and as large as the population of mnuy of the counties of Maryland. Middletown would be the most central point, being near about mid way between the northern and southern boundaries. It is inconvenient enough now, to the citizens of the lower part of the county, to be dragged away to New Castle, aud kept there three or four weeks in attendance upon the protracted sessions of the Courts, and it would be worse to have to go all the way to Wilmington, where, doubtless, the Courts would be more protracted still, keeping our citizens away from their homes and tboir business, at incalculable inconvenience to them. The saving in mileage, travelling expen ses, convenience, &c. would, iu a very few years, go far to compensate tho citi zens of tho new couuty for the cost of recting new buildings ; while the impetus it would give to trade, and the advance it would occasion Ui the price of property, is sufficient to unite all our citizeus in au earnest effort to have the county seat e rected here. The citizens of the lower section of the county should all favor it to a man, because it would be convenience to them aud a saviug of time and money to have the county seat locat ed at a point so convenient and easy of Access. e a great Now, what should be done to carry out «he above mentioned .1.. 7 T „11 _l- r„ xue above mentioned plan . Let all who fa vor it meet together, the sooner the better Let them prepare a Memorial to the Leg isiature, have a number of copies printed end placed in the hands of an active com nuttee to solicit signatures toit, and let ! cvervbodv sitrn it and thnn a *. every oouy sign it, and then present it through an influential committee, to the T.eoislntnr» ... 1 _ _ -, J.legislature, and pres» Us passage, renew ing it at the succeeding session until the thina i» nneniitnlrul,, I . Tnin 0 is accomplished. Pay no attention to old fogies, grumblers, or marolots who •nnl.l i , , would lorevor stand still and make no ad Yance in anything. Let them prumbla if Gw»» «il 4 b , ' H iney will ; it is their nature to do so, but let tho friends of the measure press • i f j • 1 • . * rign torward with it, taking such steps as will be found most efficient in accomplish . . u 

«WUIJHWU ing the result. It would be a great thin", not only for Middletown, but for all tbe lower section of tlie county, and a conve nience to tho whole people of the county. To Contributors. —We do not propose to make the Transcript a vehicle for of fensive pcrsonalitias. port with our ideas of the duty of a pub licist to devote bis paper to such uses. We wish, ns far as we can, to gratify all our friends in It docs not com publishing their offerings, but they will greatly oblige us if they will abstain from tho introduction of offeusi personalities. If they will not, it will impose upon us tbe disagreeable necessity of rejecting their communications. When •A inan, in self-defense,or iu thc defense of O-utb and right, has to resort to the press ■*«1 affixes his name to hi* writings, he Assumes the responsibility which attaches to his words, however hard they may he. But to write anonymously, and leave the responsibility resting upon tho editor, is not fair, and he should not be asked expected to incur responsibility for offen sive language under such circumstances. Wc make these remarks, because sever al articles of a personal character h peared in our columns. When dulge in personalities ourselves, (a thing wa never do, except under great prov tion) we assume, to the fullest extent, what responsibility attaches to our words. AV e have enough to do,however, to fight own bsttles, without entering tho list for othera. ve J or ave ap we in oca €ver our And, as wc are altogether peace disposition, and prefer to live in friendship with all men, we don't want »0 fight, ever with our contributors, be pained so far as to reject and article which their preference for thc Tra nay induce thorn to send to cation.

There were ono hundred and four bids f r the work TUB PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The President's Message was delivered to Congress on the first day of the sion. It is variously received and inented upon, and is deemed a piece of documentary patch-work, the product of several pens. Butler gets credit for the portion of it relating to Canada, the fish eries and the navigation of the St. Law rence. The following resume of it is taken from the Baltimore Sun : fit of in to ses cora This document was promptly delivered to Con gress on the meeting of that body on Monday, and having l>een forwarded by telegraph, was exjteditiously issued. It commenced coming over the wires about 1J o'clock p. m. and some two hours and ten minutes were consumed in its transmission and transcription. There was great popul iraient —there being no interest manifested to see the doc such crisis in the country as would intensify expectation, and no such state of circumstances as would suggest anything very novel or notable. The fact, indeed, "that it was delivered to a Congress entering upon its last short session, when little change, under the policy of the administration, is expected in that class of measures which cfiect more directly the pecuniary uud business concerns of the people, would readily açcouut for tins want of an inten ser interest of such a humdrum time in regard to what the President might have to say. After prefacing that the past year of " peace and plenty," the President begins his message by saying that "it is to be regretted, however, that a free exercise of the elective fran chise has by violence and intimidntiou been de nied to citizens, in cxpectionul cases, in several of the States lately in rebellion, aud the verdict of the people 1ms been thereby reversed." It is to be regretted that the President should have felt it incumbent to make a statement which is obvious ly intended as an apology for the odious congres sional electiou Jaw, and of the "precautionary measures" adopted by the government at some of the recent State elections. We believe that the cases in which the free exercise of tho elective franchise in any part of the country was "by violence or intimidation denied" were indeed "exjiectional," and for that reason we doubt whether in any case "the verdict of the people was reversed thereby." Nor if we recall the magnitude of the military preparations in New ^ ork city, and the use mode of the marines in Philadelphia, does it uppear that the President's apprehensions at the time of the obstruction of intimidation has been one of a 5 u the elective franchise by violence were coufiucd to " the States lately in rebellion." ; glad to learn, by the way, that Georgia, although not yet in the Union ns Ate supposed on Monday, speaking from the best information wc could obtain, is expected back shortly alter new year. Casting his eyes abroad, the President briefly states tlie steps taken in consequence of tlie Eu ropean War, both to insure the neutrality of our oAvn people, as well as to maintain our cordial relations with both of tlie beligerenls, between tvhoni the President observes that this We govern ment stands ready to employ its pood office whenever there is Reason to believe that by (hoi means the war can be shortened highly probable that the war will be closed with uiediation. The first topic upon which the message enlarg es to any extent is tlie importance of the acquisi tion of Nan Dominpo, which is urped with preat earnestness aud from a variety of points of view. The 8nme considerations and arguments formed the staple last session of a special message upon the subject. What tlie President asks for now is Authority to appoint a commission to negotiate for the acquisition of the whole island. In connection with foreign affairs, some Mcx treatics hour. It i out customs arrangements, ex traditio with the Central American States, tue Vene l*n claims, the Tien-Tsin massacres, the rectifi crt,iou of our boundary liuc on the 4-ltli parallel, lhc a i, olilion of thc , nixc d com . ts fur thn j, upprcs : sion of thc slave trade, and the naturai'- aI 'i UH MîtîîSf? cr >' troubles are discussed more at length $ ! Prudent lays the blame upon "thesemi independent but irresponsible agent know the Dominion of Canada, and asks for authority tu suspend, by proclamation, the transit of goods, wares, and merchandise in bond across the ter ritory of the United States to Canada, and, if ne «'8sao, <o exclude from the watersoftheU nited States all Canadian vessels. Besides the unneighborly acts towards our fishermen P'ahied of, allusion is made to the unfriendly disposition manifested on the part of Canada in the maintenance of a claim to exclude the citi *yns of the United States from thc free naviga Bou of thc St. Lawrence. This, as our readers are aware, is an old storv, having been thc sub 1 °, f "'R 0 . 11 "««'' b<M«eea the governments of Great Britain und the United States as tar hack 1818, and earlier. A number of the diplo !" u i ic P recc ' lu " ,s ura 'ited together with tlie im ineii8c increase ot population States which border cont d tonnage in the the great lakes, to show the reasonableness of the American clai participation in the to equal igation of thc St. Law rence, subject only to the British or Canadian right to regulate the police of the river where it flows exclusively through British territory. The unadjusted state of the Alab against Great Britain is referred to only to say that the cabinet of that country appears unwilling to concede any negligence or act duriug our w; by which the Uuited States has justifiable plrtiut, and to suggest that authority be given for the settlement of the claims of our citizens by government, in order that the latter may have their ownership as well as the the re sponsible control of all the demands against Great Britain. The depressed state of the American shipping interests is alluded to, with the promise that several propositions shall be laid before Con gress looking to a remedy for the evil. The message assumes that i built in this country without government tance, and hints at the old exploded policy of •ouraping ship-building by means of bounties. __ evils of a fluctuating and depressed cur deplored, its iu tlie claims our vessels cannot be rency ago, i premi •psage a year nd it is suggested that, with the fall in the gold, the time has probably for the wise legislation with the view of placin'* our currency once more on a specie basis. On the subject of revenue reform, what the :cordance with the this paper, und come President says is entirely i views heretofore contended for i then he adds : A true revenue reform cannot be made in a day, but must be work of national legislature and of time. As soon as the revenue can be dis pensed with, all duty should be removed from coffe, tea and other articles of universal produced by ourselves. The necessities of the country compel us to collect revenue from our im ports. An army of assessors and collectors is not a pleasant sight to the citizen, but that or a tariff for revenue i The reform of tlie ti adoption of the " correspond en c postul system is recommended. The policy inaugurated by the present admin istration of employing Friends aud other sionary agencies for the purpose of civilizing and managing the Indian is declared to have worked well, und promises the best possible results. The civil service reform also gets the benefit of the Executive approval. The following pas sage in the message will be hailed by all the ad vocates of that reform with esjieeiul pleasure, and if occasion should require hereafter, the President am remind the "adverse faction" of his words, and the propriety also of thei bracing this wholesome policy of the people, in which the politicians have been left so fur be hind thdir uncorrupted and soveioign musters. " I respectfully cull your attention to one abuse of long standing, which I would like to see re medied by this Congress. It is a reform in the civil service of the couutry. I would have it go beyond the mere fixiug of the tenure of office of clerks and employees who do not require the advice and coucent of the Senate to make their appointments complete. I would have it to gov ern not the tenure, but the pointments. There is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and thc heads of de partments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless task imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for constituents. The present system J does not secure the best men. and often even not not king privilege and the card" iu our of all ap fit men for public places. The elevation and' purification of the civil service of the government will he hailed with approval by the whole people of the United States." It is proof of the strong hold which the both of revenue and of civil service reform has taken upon the people of the country administration thus spreads its sails to catch the rising breeze. The hit at Senators and Repre sentatives is not bad. The President thinks that the day has passed for regarding the public lands of revenue to the government. They should be rather administrated in the interests of the whole country for the purpose of promoting emigration and the settlement of new States makes another Advance step also, to the measure of the people's march, and discourages the policy of granting government subsides to railroad of other operations, either of land or money. From the recommendations in favor of erecting buildings for Shite and War Departments, we infer that the President has not taken stock in any of the capital-moving projects which have started. After some minor suggestions, the message closes with the following summary of the policy of the administration, of w'ilch i t can only be said that if the practice be as good as the theory, there can be no room for opposition or criticism: " 1» conclusion, I would sum up the policy of the administration to he a thorough enforcement of every law, a faithful collection of every tax provided for, economy in the disbursement of the same, a prompt payment of every debt of the nation, a reduction of the taxes as rapidly us the requirements of the country will admit, the re ductions of taxation and tariff to be so arranged as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number, honest and fair deuling with all other people, to the end that war, with all its blight ing consequences, may be avoided, but without surrendering any right obligation due to reform in the treatment of Indians and in the whole civil service of the country, and fiually, in securing a pure, uutrammcled ballot, where every man entitled to cast a vote may do so just once, at each election, without fear of molesta tion or proscription on account of his political faith, nativity or color." These expressions nud concern about an " un traininclcd ballot," Ac. would, however, have much more consistency and force were they ac companied with that recommendation of general umesty which would restore the elective franchise to the many intelligent and worthy citizens now arbitrarily deprived of it in the interest of Party. cau e il en the direct source The President us ; a Peterson's Magazine for January, 1871, is already received.

NEWS FROM EUROPE. Thewar news from Europe is meagre, owing to the protracted trouble with the cables. Ouo dispatch from Havre ou AMouday night states that Tail commnuica tiou there with the interior of France has been severed. King William, on Sunday night, telegraphs tho Queen of Prussia some particulars of the successes of the army of the Duke of Mecklenburg, after two days' fighting, which resulted iu thc capture of St. Jean railway station and a suburb of Orleans, with thirty guns uüd 1.000 prisoners. Balloon advices from Paris, via Tours, givo particulars of the late movements of Ducrot, aud state that Thursday, 1st inst, was passed in burying the dead and succoring the wounded; that on Friday tho Germans, Saxons aud Wur temburgers, 100,000 strong, with great impetuosity tho French at Cham pigny and iu front of Yilliers, but failed to carry thc position, after seven hours' fighting, and linaly retreated, leaving their dead. The Prussian loss was put down at 15.000 to 20,000. This was tollowed Saturday by the French recrosNÎng thc Murne aud taking positions, in which the enemy made no attempt to molest them. Several attacked up on imnor engagements have since occured between the Prussians aud the right wing of thc* army of the Loire, near Montagis, iu which the French claim to have been successful. I he army of Paladines, whose real move nicnts have been a mystery since the cross ing of thc Loire on the 5th inst. is now said to be marching up the left bank of tie river to meet the French army of the east, which is (»0,000 strong, when the combined forces will move towards Fon tainebleau, and the struggle for Paris will be resumed.

Prize Fight. —A prizefight took place on Tues day morning last, between two pugilists knofn as Billy McLean, of New York, and Jim Murrik', of California, on a farm two miles from Newa«, in this county, near the Maryland liuc. It Rid been arranged for the fight to take place mhr Elkton, in Cecil county, Aid. but the appcamive of alarme number of roughs iu tlinl village pn Monday induced the authorities to telegrapblto the Police Board of Baltimore for protection. Ac cordingly Deputy Marshal Frey, with a sqnadof twenty-two men, left the city by the late train An Monday night, and reached Elkton some tyo hours after. A large number also reached Elkton by the train from the North, which arrived there at 2 o'clock, and Marshal Frey, with his posse, toffv the most of them into custody, and among thetn one •»paper correspondents. The prin cipals in the fight could not be found. M rk, and McLean was secreted in tie suburbs of Elkton. Marshal Frey at once ii formed those interested that the peace of tie State of Maryland could not be disturbed by a such exhibition. They then determined to go Delaware, only three miles distant, and thither the throng wended their way. On crossing tin line arrangements were made to pitch the ring when a constable of this county interposed bit authority and forbade the fight,"hut be found it safe to get out of the way. The police renmincu on tlu* Maryland side, having no authority to go beyond, und the arrangements were made for thd Hict. All things ready the men were called, and Mc Lean first shied his hat in the ring, and was soun followed by Murray Both men were in good condition, Murray being much the heavier of the two, and at the call cf time the work began. Both showed firmness through all the twenty five rounds which followed, though Murray was tlie more powerful, which was made up by the superior activity of McLean. In most of the rounds McLean whs thrown, and twice Murray knocked him down. Several fouls were claimed by the friends of Murray, but wi re not allowed by the referee. On the twenty-fifth round Mc Lean, who had shown much vindictivemss to rils his opponent, fell, uud while lie was down Murray struck him three times. A foul was claimed by the seconds of Mel lowed by the referee, and the fight was given to Me Lean. A scene of two •as at Ne I y nd al ild confusi nd the referee found it to his advai the State line*.
