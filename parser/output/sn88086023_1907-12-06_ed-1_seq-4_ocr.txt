Leslie V. Sprague In The Etude. THE COI.l'MMA RIVER. It is not every river in the country which enjoys the honor of being spec ially mentioned In a president's mes sage to congress. Such, however. Is the unusual honor which has come to the Colum bia river, the great river highway of the Pacific coast and such only came to one other river, the Mississippi, In President Roosevelt's message deliv ered in congress Tuesday of this ef k. Tl'te mention of the Columbia river, peclfically, as a river needing atten tion from congress, is a recognition long delayed, and It Is believed that the presIJent opened the gateway tor some excellent Columbia river legislation by this thoughtful and timely mention. Dr. X. G. Elalock, that tireless and splendid pioneer open river worker ef Walla Walla, said yesterday In the rivers and harbors congress at Wash ington, that 1200 miles of the Colum bia and Snake rivers and their con fluents could be used for navigation by 'toper congressional and state ac tion. The greater part of three great atates Oregon. Washington and Idaho, are drained try these splendid rivers, and yet navigation upon these rivers Is limited to a few shallow fcoats which are stranded upon the projecting rocks In the upper river so ften that traffic by this means Is well Igh abandoned during low water. 'lth proper appropriations, with wise and capable work these mighty atfreams, now flowing Idly to the sea, ould be filled with commerce, and h is hoped that the words of the president awaken congress to a sense of responsibility In this matter. Practically 1200 miles of magnifi cent river highway unused excepting for a small dstance out of Portland! What a vision for the pioneers of pen river transportation, to pic ture those great rivers open from the mouth to the fartherest limit! The dream is being realized slowly. Kv-ry year adds a new Impetus to the work. Every year sees the rocks dis appearing one by one from the chan nel. Soon the fullness of the vision will be enjoyed. THE
