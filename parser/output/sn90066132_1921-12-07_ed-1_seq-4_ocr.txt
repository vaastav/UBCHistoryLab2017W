Articles not meeting these sue-elfli-auons will be rejected. To the Editor: I have just ' read E. S. Hammond's article of November 2a) In which he states that the state Institutions are In the large majority of cases the re sult ut bad homes. I fear he ban the cart before the horse. The money paid in taxes might help keep up better homes, is it the poor man who is .taxing us? We all know who has tiixeil us from Caesar's time until now and the scriptures say the rich man always oppresses the poor not sometimes - -but always, Does Mi. Hammond deny this? Its a good thing Abra ham Lincoln lived before the coun try was institutionally run or his little log hut or his poverty might have been consiAareo, a detriment to character and morals most of our really great men have rose from the ranks of povertyr-simply because they were great in 3plte of their poverty. Today there is too much emphasis placed on society and too little on the rights of motherhood and childhood. Yes, children have rights, but I say (lod pity the institution-raised child. Did any one raised in one ever claim It was good for their own Children? No never. Institutions, like corporations, have no souls. If you could hear ot some things that have happened to children by ineir supposed guardians you would be haling them Into the court rooms for Justice. The only difference is a grafting concern is never molested, while step-fathers sometimes are, especially if he does hot inhabit Elizabethian struc tures and stoops to potato patch work and pig sty provision. My great wonder in tt.t, recent case ' disposed ot Is that It was such an open case of Injustice. The inno cent suffering for the guilty, the . mother and daughter separated, Instead of removing the guilty one If he was guilty. Why do men al ways shield and protect men as gainst womankind? I'll trust a mother any time when Bhe loves her child to take better care of it than any institution In the world. Lincoln's great heart beat with sympathy when he witnessed the mute and dumb suffering of the poor old black slaves separated from their children and he vowed to God if the chance ever came he Would break such evil power to pieces, but the southern aristocrats never forgave him, for haven't I heard theiu argue that they were better oft as slaves, they had no ense except as driven like cattle. Rich men always justify their deeds no matter how others suffer by it, There is no "weak senti mentality" about them either, tor they go on 'crushing out hearts and hopes of those that Christ died for.' No wonder He called the church dignitaries the children of the dovll, for the work of devils they do, and God will deprive them ot both their privileges and offices because they have been weighed in the balance and found wauting Taxing Slacker Wealth i In that meandering labyrinth of circumlocution entitled the president's message appears one sensible suggestion that will meet the approval of every one except the beneficiaries of the system, namely the abolition of the tax-exempt secur ity, a procedure which would force slacker wealth to pay its just share of the taxation it now evades. Last spring Secretary of the Treasury Mellon recom mended legislation to curb the issuance of tax-exempt se curities. While congress has frequently debated the subject, with the apparent object of finding out how not to do it, nothing has been accomplished save the issuance of some hundreds of millions of additional tax-exemDt securities to finance the new loans to industry. Even the proposal to make these issues come under the inheritance tax law met defeat , . , . . , It has been estimated that from 20 to 40 billions of wealth is escaping taxation, in these tax-exempt securities issued by nation, state, city and district. The fact that wealth can evade taxation by such investment has largely nullified the surtax and so increased the burden of taxation for nthpr forms of property. To make matters worse, the issuance of such securities shows no signs of diminution on the con trary, is rapidly increasing. . - v The worst feature of the situation is that capital that should go into useful production and needed industry is directed into these untaxed investments to escape 'paying its share of the cost of government. The president M led to outline a program of procedure to congress, contenting Mmself with suggesting a constitu tional amendment. Congress is, however, too accustomed to obstruction and destruction to do much in a constructive! way. uut until congress ends for all time the -issuance of tax-exempt securities, all efforts to tax wealth will be abortive. t&rraf ife VMUms d Jbnunatic $toy iMinU&irfeft Ambition- ft: l?? I It Virginia Motor With Herb As I sat revelling in Kia's dress ing room at the studio thinking over my first day in the morleb and preparing to go home, I found I had been living somewhat on the outside of it all. I had been revelling in others' experiences and they had all been so very now to me. Could I make these ex periences of. any use to myselt? I had barely concluded, that I might do so.when gome one rapped' at me aoor. "Rial Ria!" It was Herb Rich, ardson'a voice. "Ria isn't here. Mr. Richardson. She has .gone home. She is trying to find you," "All" right. I'll wait for you and take you down." I had a moment's doubt about this. Was It the right thins lor me to do? In Ria's present excit ed state ot mind would Bhe under stand? However, I decided to go with him. I do not think that we always realise our thoughts and actions are affected by the seemingly least Important of experiences, but I have now come to believe that Weeping over white slaver Roy- eton Is simple and pure "weak son timentality," but there is no bond on earth like that between mother .and child. I would put the man on rock pile and leave the daughter home. Revelattona tells us that the number ot man is the number ot the beast and also man was made a little lower than the angels, while the same book says "woman should have power on her head because of the angels. thus placing her in line with the angels. Thus we find man a dom tnatlng usurper throwing out floods of water, spouting against her always, since Adam to now. Dut God repented he made man He was so wicked. Later he made a perfect mat, but it was com bination of God and woman man left out altogether. Ha wanted a being: ot love and purity. God says choose ye. Man says do as I aay or I'll make you suffer and all the Buffering ia this world is brought by blind bossy man. He even bates kU own sex. He espouse the causa of women and children and . all the weaklings gat such moral astigmatism that they can't possi bly read his paper any longer, but pl-:ae God the scales are tailing off other eyes two to one.
