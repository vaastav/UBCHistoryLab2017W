PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS STAND AGAINST ALLIANCES; GOVERNOR'S WIFE TO FACE ORDEAL IN HIS DEFENSE Today Kilkenny Fighting. So Says Mr. Pig. The President's Message. Trucks, Labor, Farms, Etc. - ?By ARTHUR BRISBANE? <Ca*grr%M. IRt) ?TTAR to th? death," say th* Irishmen opposed to the Free State. "The fighting will go on as long as there is a man in Ireland." It reminds yoa of the Kilkenny cats, and doeant sound wise. It is amusing for England, rather than useful for Ireland. It is bloody war, unfortunately. Day before yesterday enemies of the Free State killed one Irish official, wounded another. Yes terday the Free State hanged Kory O'Connor and Liam Mel lowes to show that killing can be done on both sides. A hard situation for those in terested only in Ireland's wel fare, but it means that the Free State is established. The Irish are not afraid of a fight. The Free State men are in the majority, which means at least three Kilkenny cats on their side against one. The Minority cat cannot win. A 

GENTLEMAN, now fretting a little hour upon the di vorce stage, wrote to his second wife, "There is something 'about motherhood that is almost an tagonistic to romantic love." That's old. When little pigs ?re born it is necessary to re nove the father pig from the ?on. He also considers such an event "antagonistic to romantic love" and unless removed he will eat up the little pigs. A man's objection to "unromantic'' moth er love diminishes as he gets farther away from the mental attitude of the gentleman pig. Some men are not far from that attitude. rpHE PRESIDENT'S AD DRESS says do away with the labor board. A labor di vision of the Interstate Com merce Commission would take its place, which would be the same thing under another name. All depends upon who appoints the men. * TIE says the Eighteenth Amendment is going to ?tay and that's certain. You could not get thirty-six States to vote it out. He says strict enforcement should compel public opinion to tell whether it wants modification or not. Good common sense. f|*HE 

PRESIDENT asks for two constitutfonal amend ments, one to control child labor, the other to stop the flood of securities that pay no tax and provide a financial cy clone cellar in which the rich can hide. The public will ap prove. But that they will get the two amendments js doubt ful. 

1ITIDER credits for farmers, " the President recommends. That's reasonable. When a Wall Street man can get all the money he wants at 4 per cent to gamble in stocks, a farmer should be able to bor row at 6 per cent to plant more wheat or corn, or to build a silo. He 

PRODUCES wealth ?Wall Street GAMBLES in wealth. rTHE PRESIDENT wants to keep out "radical immi grants." All right, if you let in good workers. Radicalism is necessary, but there is enough of it among the farmers to carry this country along for a while. QN FOREIGN AFFAIRS the President "points with pride" to his administration. He says our constitution allows us "to exercise moral influence" in Europe. Fine, if we stop there. All the 

MORAL is what the public wants. "We ash no one to assume re aponsibility for us, we assume no responsibility which others must bear for themselves," says the President. Bravo! r|?HE PRESIDENT will control freight hauling by trucks. Truck roads should not parallel steam roads, and compete with them, but rather "feed" these roads. Railroad owners will agree with that, tearfully, for truck competition keeps them awake. (Continued on Pace 2, Column I.)

Miss Birkhead. a frail wisp of a woman, pallid and wan. sat a few feet from the men who pointed a i finger of scorn at her. She wilted perceptibly as their charges were re cited. Old rustics from the Mississippi "Hinterland" volunteered to blight the reputation of their former neigh bor with weird stories of what they had "hearn' tell." Rl'RAL PASTOR TESTIFIES. "She had a general bad reputa tion. that girl did." spoke up the Rev. J. B. King, pastor of the Dover M. E. Church. "She played that thar ragtime right In church, and I hearn that she danced thar. too." The parsons' charges were typical of the views whicl^ the village char acters held of that "no 'count gal."

He told of regular nocturnal ren dezvous with her In which he "hugged and klaaed her at wlU."

When released Kozeny was unable to move his limbs, paralyzed by their long shackling. Mrs. Kozeny, the only other occu pant of the "Mystery House." re sisted the officers, who were forced to break down the barricade with an axe. "You can't take my boy from me," she screamed. "You can kill me, but you can't have him." The room was walled up by the mother. He was kept In total dark ness. Mrs. Kozeny, it was said, had be come a maniac from her self-imposed imprisonment.

ASSAILS CRITICS OF NATION Would Abolish Labor Board as Now Formed and Include It in I. C. C. By JAMES R. NOURSE. President Harding, in a 7,000 word message read yeaterday be fore a Joint session of Senate and House gave Congress , broad ?nd comprehensive program for constructive legislation. The message was an exhaustive review of the country's agricultu ral, industrial, transportation and economic problems; it was accom panied by detailed and specific ree ommendations for their solution. 

COVERED WIDE RANGE. .It covered many subjects and dealt with many questions, which to the mind of the Executive, are pressing for legislative action at the earliest possible moment. It recom mended antl-strlke legislation as a cure for one of the many tils of the transportation situation: against this It proposed, as a measure of fair treatment to the railway work ers. enlargement of the powers of the Railroad Labor Board, transfer of the board to the Interstate Com merce Commission, snd endowing It with greater authority to establish a living wage, based upon living coat*. The message advocated broader ex tension of land credits to farmers, nation-wide survey of forests and water power facilities, prohibition of further Issuance of tax-exempt se curities. adoption of an amendment to the Constitution to abolish child labor, and the enactment of laws to curb profiteering by middlemen In foodstuffs and other necessities. WOULD REGISTER ALIENS. On the subject of immigration, the message recommended strict regis tration of all aliens, and the en forcement of measures to check the activities of persons who preach doc trines inimical to the existence of the Government. Standing out like a beacon light In the message was the President s strong reaffirmation of his foreign Policy to keep the United States out of European affairs and entangle ments. ? The President's ringing declara tion on this subject was a challenge to the world-wide propaganda which >s demanding that the United States shall go to the aid of Europe. It was a direct answer to "Tiger" Clemenceau. now in this country de manding the assistance of America in the solution of France's troubles with the rest of the world. The President declared frankly and flatly that the United States intends to keep out of Europe. Senators and Representatives ap plauded vociferously his statement, which was: 

RAPS "81PERGOVERNMENT." We have had expressed the hostility of the American people to a supergovernment or to any commitment where either a coun cil or an assembly of leagued powers may chart our course. Treaties of armed alliance can have no likelihood of American sanction, but we believe in re specting the rights of nations. In the value of conference and consultation. In the effectiveness of leaders of nations looking each other In the face before resorting to the arbitrament of arms.
