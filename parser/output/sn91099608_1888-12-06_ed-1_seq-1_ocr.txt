It wants tliiB upon tbe ground that, unless there is a speoial session of oongress, it thinks this will be the quiokest method for securing statehood. It is well enough to be tally under stood. The Trees and Dakataian does not want a new constitutional conven tion if statehood oan be more speedily secured nnder the old constitution. It recognizes a necessity for completing the admission of the south half of Dakota daring the life time of the next congress. The suooeeding congress may be dem ocratic. Admission oan hardly be com pleted under the Flatt bill (whioh is the old constitution) daring the existence of the inoommg oongress nuless a Bpeoial session is held and the Flatt bill enacted at that session. After the Fiatt bill be oomes a law it is to be sent to the peo ple of Dakota for ratification and then back from the people to oongresB for farther final legislation. Uader a new constitutional gathering, authorized by the legislature of Dakota, a constitution oould be adopted and ratified by the time the new oongress convenes in rega lar session (a year hence). Congress could act upon it immediately and the state would be a state withoat any more bother. It is under such conditions that the Press and Dakotaian "wants a new constitutional conventionThere is another argument in favor of a new constitutional convention—it would en able us to agree upon a suitable name for our state and oast out the proposed prefix. The Sioux Fulls Press states farther aloQg in its article that the old constitu tional convention is still in existence, and says: It oan assemble at any time and sub mit to the people the same questions as those specified in the senate bill for re submission. The points sought to be covered by snob bill oould be thereby provided for, and the' constitution be made ready for immediate congressional aotion. There will probably be no objection to this plan. It appears more feasible than the eleotion of a new constitutional convention and would afford a great saving of time, whioh is the important element in the case. Oar impression, when our first artiole on the Bubjeot was written, was that the old oonstitotional convention bad expired. If the Frees is correct in its statement that the con stitutional oonveation still exists, then the legislature need not be called upon to authorize another constitutional or ganization. It would be better, bow ever, for that body to submit an entire new constitution and not attempt to patoh up the old one through amend atory forms. This ooald be aooomplish ed and a satisfactory constitution pre sented for aotion at the opening of ths next oongress and under it the state machinery set in motion by a single aot of legislation. UnlesB there is a speoial session of oongress this is the best and quickest pian. Dots ii meet with the approval of the Sioux Falls Frees Senator Allison was asked a few days ago concerning a speoial telegram from Lima, O., in whioh Riilroed Commis sioner Campbell, of Iowa, was quoted as saying that the senator had been offered the secretaryship of the treasury by FreBident-eleot Harrison, He said: "I don't bolievo Mr. Oampbell made the statement credited to him, for I have not seen htm sinoe the election, and he does uot koow that I have been ten dered the nomination referred to, be cause it bas not been offered to me. I know nothing more about my going into President Harrison's cabinet than the public knows." The impression is gain ins ground in Washington very rapidly that Senator Allison will be the next secretary of the treasury, notwithstand ing that be refasea admit that he is to be in charge of that portfolio. Democrats and democratic newspapers have beeB endangering their necks by the reokless rapidity with whioh they have tumbled into the division oamp sinoe eleotion. That is, generally speak ing, they have, but here is a democratic newspaper, the Huron Horald-Demoorat, whioh calmly beatrideB the ridge pole of the highest tent and exclaims: Aa we have conclusively shown in former issues of this paper, the demo cratic party of this territory was the originator and promoter of the division sentiment. Comment is entirely anneooisary. What a vast expanse of cheek I In perusing the perenninal Raral Voioe of November 30th we discover that it still flies at its masthead the legend "For president-i-Benjamin Harrison. For vioe president— Levrt?. Morton." It the eweet seclusion of its rural exis tence the truly Rural Voioe seems not to have ascertained that there has been an election and that Beoj imin and Levi got there amid the load applause of a hilarious nation.

Again the date of the Sioax Falls re oeption to the Manitoba officials has been ohanged. It will oooar next Tnes day eveniDg. An interesting feature of the preparations is a telegram from the Manitoba cfiloials in which tbey express desire to mebt a Yankton delegation on '.that oooasion. The Yankton dele gation will be there in full drees. Ou Tuesday tho demooratio house re ceived with great complaoenoy a petition of citizens of north Dakota, for the Im mediate admission into the union of south Dtkota and Montana, and for con Rtitational conventions in north Dakota, Washington and New Mexioo. The petition was referrod to Springer's com mittee. Judge Templeton renders conspicuous tbe opening of his jadioial oareer by di teating the Grand Forks grand jary to indict or oenBure Editor Murphy, of the Plaindealer, for uncomplimentary re marks in his paper concerning that body. GROVtR'S LAST GASP. Comment at the Capitol Upon the Presi dent's Closing Message. Washington speoial: No better com mentary on President Cleveland's message could be desired than that given by the members of the hoase dur ing the reading of the document this afternoon, when the democrats ap plauded certain features and tho repub iiouLS hissed other portions. When the refertnoe to the surplus in the treasury aa not being intended to force free trade was read the democrats immediately be gan a vigorous applause and the repub licans gave vent to a stage laugh that that drowned the hand olapping. Tbe uontruBt between the demonstrations on the two sides was so great that in voluntarily almost every eye turned toward Mrs. Cleveland and her mother, who aat on the front seat in tbe dip lomatic gallery. They looked serious. With very few exceptions—and those are among the protectionist demoorats— opinions as to the morits of the melange are confined within party lines. The democrats generally are glad that the president has again proclaimed in favor of free trade, and, as Ohairman Mills putB it this evening, "are proud to Bee the president still flying the flag of re form ." Mr. Mills does not believe the free trade utterances of the president in his message a year ago had anything to do with tbe obange of public opinion as to tbe aims of tbe demooratio patty, or that tbey contributed to Mr. Cleveland's defeat. He heartily endorses all the president has ever said about tan IT re form and free trade. Tbe two Breoken lidges, who are democratic members of the house committee on ways and means, heartily ap plauded the sentiment of the message as it was read, and deolared that it is tbe best dooument ever Bent to congress. They, too, ire gratified to see that Mr. Cleveland's stand on the tariff has not been shaken by the recent election, 1'bey join Mr. Mills in dtolaring that the representatives of tbe demooratio party in congress do not intend to alter or amend the tariff platform, but say it will stand aB a laud mark for futare oampaigns. Tbey are in favor _f simply reaffirming the platform in tbe next straggle for the presidency. Senator Ransom, of North Carolina, expressed the views of the demoorats in the upper branoh of oongress when he said: It is tbe ablest of tbem ail, and shows that our leader is standing by his gune.' The republicans in both houses use some very vigorous language in denouncing the message. Senator Allison this eve ning said: "It is unpatriotio," The Benatorhas speoial referenoe to the sec ond paragraph in tbe message, which casts eerinus doubt upon the. wisdom of he foundation of tbe republic, beoause it is "founded upon the freedom of tbe people." He thinks the president has struck a very cruel blow at the Amerioan form of government, simply beoause its citizens did not retain him in power. Senator Shermab said: "It contains nothing new, exoept oertain forms of complaint." Senator Oullom said: "Mr.Cleveland seemB determined to go out with a blas ter. He is disappointed, scolds severely and appears to doubt not only tbe wis dom of the present people, but the framers of our constitution." Representative MoKinley, of Ohio, said: "It is a post mortem examination of the deinooptio platform." General Groavenor, also of Ohio, said "The message is a motion for a new trial, but tbe oourt has no jurisdiction and the verdiot will have to. stand." These views give a good idea of those expressed by all men in oongress, who have so far given otteranoe to their opinions of the message, Io some quar ters there is great indignation over the oommumstio and anarchistio sentiments of the president. Several members ot oon gress go so far as to say that Johan Most and his follewerB oan find texts in tbe president's message to fire the heart* 0f their conrerts for years to oome. Tae soldiers are also iBdlgnant. They re gard tbe language of tbe president, where be refers to pensions, as "gratui ties granted upon no other real ground than the needy condition of the appli cant, or for reasons less valid," as au unnecessary insult to the veterans, bat they add that it is only io the line that be has followed e*er sinoe he went to tbe white bouse, and thai in the future it will oauae tbe jldteia to stand mole solidly together than tbey have ever stood.

TARIFF LEGISLATION. The Meaate Substitute* for the 311'Js Kill to bo Puttied. Washiugtenspoci.il, 4th: Tbo senate oommittee on ilnanoe at its meeting to day dtioided that tbe senate suDstitate for tbe Mills tariff bill shall be pushed to a vote, and tl at it shall take prece dence ovor all otbtr business boforo the seagte. At the iLformal bearing repie sentatives of tbe cutlery and the cooper age interests were hoard. Shortly be tore o'clock Senator Allis jn, for tho oommittee, called up the substitute, and atked that the formal reading of the bill be dispensed with,.but Senator Tanoe, of North Carolina, objtcted, and tbe clerk was proceeding with tbe reading, when Mr. Vanoe announced that V'-e objeot in demanding that the bill be not read waB to Beoure delay, as it was desir able that there should be au understand ing among the democrats as to what amendments will be offered. This, he caid, oould not be determined before 2 o'olook to-morrow afternoon. Senator Allison said that the republican mem bers of tbe annate would not interpose obstructions, under these oiroamstanoes, but that tbey would be willing to grant the delay desired, and with this understanding tue senate ad journed until to morrow Several re publican members of tbe senate oommit tee on finanoe informed your correspon dent this afternoon that the programme adopted provides that the bill shall be first diBoussed.by seotions, and that amendments shall be voted on seriatim. After this is done it will again be con sidered by sections and additional op portunity will be given to amend. It is the expeotation of the republicans that tbe final vote will be taken before the holidays, unless there srs evidences of faotional opposition on tbe part of the demoorats. It is not thought that the democratic senators will try to obstract, and as a oonsequenoe, those in obarge of the measure er.peot that it will be reedy to send baok to the house before tbe holidays. The chances are that the bill will be modified in several important particulars, whioh will win for it the support of some of the southern demo crat who voted for tbe Mills bill. Among other things proposed is a modi fication of tbe sugar schedule so that the oat on that staple will foil a little below the figure proposed by the bill as it came from the finanoe oommittee. Mr. Mills ohairman of the committee on ways and means, said to-day that be thought that the senate would send over to the house a bill which would be likely to meet the approval of the republioans ts a body, as well as several democrats. He said further that he thought the bill, or rather the substitute, would secure enough votes in the buuse to insure its passage. Mr. Mills' diagnosis of tbe situation is endorsed by tbe republioeiu. Tbey say that the senate bill will doubtless repeal the tobaooo tax entirely, and that if it does it will certainly Beoure tbe support of a number of the demooratio members from the tobaooo grow n? regions. It is predicted that the senate bill will certainly secure tbr? support of the en tire republican side of the house, as well as the votes ot tba four demoorats. Sowder, of Pennsylvania, Bliss, Merriam and Greenman, of New York, wbo voted aRainst the Mills bill, as well as Randall of Pennsylvania and Foran, of Ohio, one of whom was absent and tbe other did not vote when the bill came up for ao tion in tbe bouse. It is argued farther that as a reduotion of the surplus is one of the thicgs for which tbe democrats have been contending, there will be others from the northern aud western states wbo will be inolined to vote tor the sub stitute, rather than see tbe session brought to aa end without tbe accom plishment of this objeot. Further than this, those wbo support the republican view of tbe situation say, that the repeal of the tobaooo taxe will be sure to se oare the support of tbe members from North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee, whoBe constituents era direotly Inter ested in tobaoco oulture. Among those wbo are counted upon as sure to support the substitute are Cowles and Johnson, of North Carolina, West and O'Farrell, of Virginia, and poesibly Phelan and Euloe, of Tennes see. Seeney, Wilkins and Foran, of Ohio, and Hall and Ermentrout,of Penn sylvania, are among tbe list marked ts sure to vote for the senate substitute, rather than for no bill at all. DISCUSSED BY DAKOTAIANS. A (Large Ktimber ot the People From the Territory io Ht. Paul—What They Hay. St. Paul Pljneer Press, 4th: Dakota was well represented St. Paul yester day. Among those about the hotel oor ridors were Storetary MoDormaok, Grand Forks Hon. Charles T. McCoy and Ma]. W. A. Moore, Aberdeen Hon. M. H. Day, Rapid Citj John E. Haggart and W. P. Miller, Fargo Hon. Alex HagbeB, Bismarok W. H. Parkhocaa, Valley City Ot. W. B. Werreu, OarringtOD 8am T. Clover, Sioux Falls J. S. Eokelman and Charles E. Holt, Grand Forke. It wts not in any senBe a politioal gather ing, and most of tbe gentlemen olaim6d to be in St. Paul on businee, or just passing through the oity, The fact that Hon. a. 0- Mellette of Watertown, the governor of South Dakota under the ion*. Falls constitution, was expected, but failel to put appearonoe, gave rise to tbe suspicion that the meeting of so many Uakotaians was not all a matter of ohanoe. Tbe convention at Jamestown for North Dakota was disoussed by several of the gentlemen, and though they all olaimed not to have a very clear idea as to the intention of those who were in strumental in calling it together, they were hopeful^bat it might be produotive of good, and that the bill set in motion would result in tbe early admission of both section*. Capt, Alex Hughes, who is a member eleot of the territorial or ua. oil, said tbat while he supposed be oould not be at the meeting, he believed that it was in good hands, and what was dose would be for tte beet interests cf tbe territory. Tbe geutlemen from south Dakota do not take tbat lively interest in the Jamestown convention that i« shown by the northern statesmen, Msj. Moore end Charlie MoCoy are from tbat portir of Dakota that is sup posed to be in favor of admiiisios aa whole, but they are not making any great effort to prevent admission. Msj Moore said: Oar republican convention, wbioh sent delegation* to Oiuoego, deolared for tvro ^•V wr'sA!w§f ij"'H-"5 states. 'The republicans of oer seotion, even though they naturally prefer ad mission BB a whole, will not oppose tbe moasareB in progress for division end admission. It will make but little dif ference to us and we are onxious tbat some deoisive aotion should fce taken as soon as possible. We would of course become a part of South Uakota. I pre sume our people would prefer that this seationeboald not be admitted under the Sionx Falls constitution. There was so little interest manifested in the mat ter at the time—the general belitf being that whatever was done would not amount to anything—that it was for the moBt part allowed to go by default. A new convention will be best for South Dakota. In this connection a prediction as to what tbe Dakota legislature will do in tbe matter of division and admission might be in ordtr. If the matter is brought ap in the right shape it is prob able that tbe legislature will authorize a oonstitotional convention for both seotiona of the territory, and that they will be oalled during tbe early summer. Tbe opposition to tbis scheme will oome largely from those wbo are interested in tbe Sioux Falls constitution and the officers elected under its provisions. Mr. McCoy was for many yeats a land officer at Aberdeen. He is a republican and lesnB toward admission as a whole. In the early days there wai not political scheme sSeating Dakota in whioh Charlie MoOoy did not figure, He ac cepts division if it comeB, but objeots to an equal division of the name. He said: Why should there be a "South" Dako ta and a "North'' Dakota? Is tfco.e not brains enough in tbe territory to dis cover a name that would be suitable for one section or tbe other without prefix ing compass points as a distinguishing mark? Make one section "Dakota" and the other "Linooln" or anything else. It those fellows in the north want the name "Dakota" let tbem have it and we will fiind a name for our half. Tbe amount of ink tbat will be consumed in writing those prefixes in the time to oome will make tbe Jim river navigable, It is too bad to saddle future generations with those long names. As a matter of faot I think one name will be enough and that the wholo 150,009 square miles will be admitted under the name of "Dakota M. H. Day still adheres to his deter mination not to talk poIitiOB, but the broad smile that spreads over his feat ures every time there is anything said about the early retirement of Gov. Oburob, indicates tbat Mr. Day is per fectly satisfied with the turn affairs have taken. He claims to be attending to his mining busiaesa in the Blaok Hills, and his conversation shows that he finds it far more pleasant than politios. "That's What My Wife Says." "How are ail the folks?" asked Brown of Jones. "All well, exoept my wife," said Jones. "I'm worried aboat htr. She tires out so easily she complains of a baekaobe about all the time, and abe is &o low spirited tbat she don't seem like herself at all."

It- is well ascertained that a falling off in vigor, re-tilting fr indigestion and mnl-nutritTon, inoreases liability to rheumatism.
