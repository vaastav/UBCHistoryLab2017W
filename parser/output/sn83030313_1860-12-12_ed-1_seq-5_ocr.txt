Col.rMBCS, Ga. , Dor. 11, 1M0. I have recently travelled through all the principa cities of Georgia, and ttud the disunion feeling every where overwhelmingly in the ascendant. Efforts are being made by leading men In the cotton States to obtain agreement on the following pro gramme ? 1.? Each Cotton State is to secede immediately upon ttie assembling of their several Conventions. 2.? They are then to confer the powers withdrawn from the federal government upon their respective Legislatures, and said powers are to be assumed by said l.egislatures upon a day nxed by agreement between the States. 3. ? The 3d day of March will be the day agreed upon if the seceding States consent to this arrangement. Senator Clay , of Alabama, has resigned his seat in the United States Senate, to lake effect on the 4th of March, provided Alabama does not secede. He is now in I />u isiana, in such a state of health that it is feared he may never return. A mass meeting was held in this city to-day and dele gatce nominated to the Suite Convention. They will be elected by au overwhelming majority. Columbus has hitherto been decidedly ultra m its Unionism. IMPORTANT FROM LOUISIANA. MEETINU OK THE LEGISLATURE? MKSSAtiE OF TDK GOVERNOR. Baton Roto*, Dor. 10, 1860. The extra session of the Louisiana legislature com menced to (lay. The Governor'!! message was delivered. He exhorts calmness and <lelilx>r:tti< >n. He says the elec tion of Mr. I.iucoln shows that the Northern mind is poi soned against the South; that the wise counsels of our fathers are forgotten, and the fratern.il remonstrances of the South are disregarded. He recommends a Conven tion, and says Ix>uisiana ought not to refuse to meet her sister slaveholding States in council to demand of the North the repeal of her obnoxious legislation and guaran tee aga.ust future similar measures. He says these ques tions should be met before the inauguration of Mr. Lin coln, because tho self-respec t anil honor of the State does not comport with her remaining under a black republi can President. A resolution recommends tho erection of a military board, and asks an appropriation of half a million for tho purchase of arms for volunteer companies. The members are not disposed to act hastily, but are in favor of preparing for any emergency. 

REPORTS FROM CHARLESTON. ACTIVITY AT THK FORTIFICATIONS, ETC. CiuiuwTO.N , Dec. 11, 1800. Four hundred men are said to be engaged in strength ening the fortification at Fort Sumpter. The heavy guns are being rapidly placed in position. Oastle Puickuey is being set in order. The activity manifested at all the harbor forts is viewed with suspicion here. Attorney General Black's letter has counteracted in a great measure the impression of peaceable separation produced by the President's Message. Strangers are not admitted into Fort Moultrio unless known by somo officer. The work is conducted so q i.etly tbat few here are fully aware of its extent. Midshipman F. M. Thomas, of South Carolina, has re signed from the Annapolis Naval Academy and returned home. The people hero are very anxious about the result of the Governor's election. The legislature balloted twice to-day Ineffectually. The leading candidates were pick "ns, Johnson, Kheti and J.imiefcon. A choice will proba bly be made to morrow. 

INTERESTING LETTER FROM HON. JOHN HELL. Nasuvtll*, Dec. 6, 1800. Dkak Sib ? Could I have flattered myself that any argu ment I could address to the mass meeting ap|>ointcd for the 'JPth ult. at Vicksburg, would contribute lu any im portant degree to aid you and vour c. unjMtr ots in siev ing the progress of the sentiment which threatens to pre cipitate your Mule into a political vortex, which in my judgment would be no less fatal in her own interests than ruinous to those of her neighbors. I would, at any personal sacrifice, have obeved Ike dmimons of my friends, but feeling no suet. c<*itid*ace in inv ability t? serve them as you ascribe to fue la your letter, I have yielded to the force of circumstances which claimed my attention at home. So far as my views and opinions may have any weight or influence in determinn g tlie course of any portion of the people of Mississippi in the pre-ent critical juncture, they may be stated on paper, and. I suppiee w > i!d be as rfbetire for the purpoee iut nd( d as they would be if oufnmumcaled in a s|>eccb. Tlie question of chief uu;>orUnce to be considered and answered is, whether the election of Mr. Lincoln to tho Presidency . considered in all its s g.i.Uc.tncv and Ix-ai ings, together with all precedent and existing g.'ievanc s, would Justify Mississippi, or any other State or States, in withdrawing from th" I'uiour In form til ? election was in strict accordance with the regulations prescribed by the constitution and laws. The objection to it is that it was effected liy a purely sectional party, organized upon the principle of hostility to slavery, and liav mg f >r its prime object the rcpreHSion of slavery as a permanent ad nunmtrative policy, with a view to 'its ultimate extiuc til* It CMM be touMM I An mm admimutrmrum of th* gam mount, bmtrl upon iku yoit | ctmi-i opertti* fmr wv>r* c/nimU| im brtmymf th* 'a'ynctvm nf ilany in Uu S-miA, tkrom?h trffi ami wrtaeeo* mmd pntronmy*, ihmn bg m ?? mnrt ill rrel m <*U a* a to- Jc. But it is clear that the federal government was estab lished for no such purpose or object . for. however strong ly inaa; of the frame rs of the constitution wore opposed to slavery, it is nntorioii^Tthat it was owing to th?ir for bearance to uiKist upon their objections to the clause in the instrument, providing for the rendition of fugitive slaves to their owners, that wo hare any federal I nl m. It was upon this question that the Cuavention was at one t ime upon the point of break irg ?p in confusion The policy of making the government an instrumentality lor the repression or extinction of slavery as is low attsmpt ed by the party which is soon to be in power, was never contemplated by the framers of the constitution.

This experiment, if not conceived in a spirit of disunion, was made with a reckless disregard of rouse |iiene< ?

One of the important objects to j be accomplished by the adoption of the constitution, aa declared in the preamble, wan to "insure domestic tr.in quillity;" and the power was expressly Riven to the j federal governmant by that instrument to " sup press insurrections."

If tuck nn eirnt , which u more than pouMe, should really ha pprn, it j might become the duty of Mr Lincoln to restore the tranquility which the policy of bio parly had disturbed, and to suppress an insurrection which the same policy I had excited. In stating the exceptions which may be fairly taken by the South to the election of Mr. Ijucoln, I have purposely presented . in the strongest light, the dangers to which Southern rights and interests are exposed, that it may uot be supported that I had not considered or com pre bended the full extent of the injurious consequences which may result from the present menacing attitude of the North upon the slavery question, before I formed an opinion upon the grave question, whether the election of Mr. Lincoln, in all its bearings, together with all the pre cedent grievances of which tho South have a right to complain, furnish any sufficient cause to justify the sur render by tho Southern States of thoir interest in the rich and glorious heritage of the I'nion, and to seek safety and the undisturbed enjoyment of their rights iu a South eru confederacy. With this explanation I am now pre pared to say, unhesitatingly and unequivocally, that it would not; and the confidence I feel in the solidity of the grounds upon whiah I give this answer will bo justi fied by the following considerations ? 1. Mr. Lincoln, U u wtU learns* does nit hold ex feme opinims on the tubjf. of slavery It is certain that he has expressed a decided opinion that the South has a constitutional right to deiriand the faitnt'ul execution of the Fugitive Slave law, and that under cer tain circumstances he would l'eel it his duty not to op pose the admission of a new slave Slate into the I'nion. His declaration on this point is little satisfactory to the South; but neither that d-n:laratiou nor the opinion ex pressed by him on the subject of the Fugitive Slave law is at all satisfactory to the extremists of his own party. Vp-m the wh,>U, if Mr. Lincoln s j/uWt e declarations on Che subject of slater y are to be consutere I as the true tmpn nents of his future policy, and if he possesses the moral i courage to ad her r to t hem tn oppoettiim to the counsels of the i rstrrme men ot his part* < and it is just and fair to pre- i suine that he does (Nissess that virtue), no serious mis- | chtef need be apprehenaent during his administration, except the usual evils ai'snainy the perpetual citation of ths liamy issues. 2. Hut it is Hssnnied by some that Mr. Lincoln has dis guised his true seutitneiits; that his truo character has not been understood, and that he will be under tho control of the worst men of his party. I do not thiuk so. I have every confidence that his future policy will be found to he in strict conformity with his jms't declara tions. Rut apart from this, it is uow generally known that he will be powerless for mischief, except to a very limited extent, during the first two years of his adminis (ration, unless the Southern senators and representatives elected to tho next Congress should rashly, and, as I think, inexcusably resign their .-wvits or reuro from Con gress, and thus voluntarily surrender the control iu both houses to the republican party, which surely they will not do. H'ltA both htnitei oftftoteil to him, Mr. LxnaAnran not njfoint his I'abtnrt ministers or Jill any office* o f high grade without the ass ent < f the Senate, or indent of any infe nor grade above that if a cUrk or petty il ejruiij postmaster. If' will be able to carry no nun-tut e amnateil with th-- rul> ject of rlan-ry which does not rummer"1 itself to the SutUh irul th* conservative members from the Xurth. 3. As to any apprenensions that the republican party, encouraged and stimulated to further efforts by their late success, may be so strengthened in the result of the elec tions of senators and representatives in the meantime as to obtain a majority iu both houses of the Thirty eighth Congress, that is, during the last two years of 'Mr. Lin coin's administration ? wbilo it may bo well to regard such an event as possible, the strongest reasons exist for the confident belief that no such unfortunate result will attend the elections in the North, which are to docide the complexion of the Thirty eighth Congress. Of tho whole uutnber of votes cast for Mr. Lincoln In the recent election, from my own personal knowledge, ' and from information received from other sources, of the sentimw&ts of tho ,?outh, and especially of those of llie Middle States, and the States north of the Ohio, I am sure I hazard nothing in stating that a large number ? at least one-third ? are devoted to the I'nion, and. although opposed to slavery in the abstract, have but little sym pathy with the republican jwrly , and would be sincerely glad to see thi slavery controversy between the two great sections of the country speedily terminated. They supported the republican candidate m the late election, mainly influenced by their strong and inveterate feelings of opposition to the democratic party, believing that Mr. Lincoln was the onl;' available candidate in the held to defeat that party. I am also well satisfied that not more than one third part of Mr. Ijncoln > supporters are so extreme in their anti-slaverv sentiments, atd are animated by so intense a hn i red of" the South, as to be either wholly indifferent to the effect upon the I'nion of the policy of (he republi can party, or actually desirous of a separation of the free from the slave Staws. (if the remaining third of Mr. Lin<v>ln's supporters, I (lunk I am warranted in savin? tluit the) are attached to the I'nam. (hough auti-slavery in their sentiments. They Joined the republican parly as a retaliatory measure, adopted in resentinont ot the repeal of the Missouri Com promise, which they regarded as little less sacred and binding than (he constitution, and in further resentment of the attempt to lorce the l<ecompton constitution upon the people of Kansas. But now that they have so signally triumphed in the late election, and in view of the evils already iullicted upon the country , and the still gre iter evils to be apprehended, they will be coutent to cease the war upon Southern interests and reeling*. Hir the fvregoing cuutins I fetl confident that the Thirti/ eighth O.-ngres* mil exhibit a falling ijf tn the strength of the rejuUiran party tneteiul if an im-rnw. 4 JU of the rmseing arievmcet of which the South ma y jiutlt eomflaim, cms be regretted in ths Union As to the indignity, not to say insult, offered to the South, of noiui nating ami electing (ho candidates fur the two hirhost offices of (ho government by a sectional party, on principles which practically excluded the South ern States from a voice In the election, con trary to ?stabliahed usage, and in violation of th<t spirit of the constitution tho> may b" pardoned for the sake of peace and harmony, and in considermtsm that the .South l??s not b.-en guiltless of having contributed, and Ihst in no small degree, to increase tho violence and it* pent ics ol the slaver) controversy between the two sec tions. In expressing the opinion that all grievance* maybe r<dress<-d in the Union, I tntended to exclude other greater oflt-ncra which liave been apprchendod from rep ib tcan domination and which are ol possible occurrence. How they shall be redrexsed . should they unhappily occur, will call for new counsels; out ''stitlicient unto the day is the evil then-of.'1 The existing grievances are the obstructions interposed by some of the n?n slaveboldmg States to the prompt aud faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave law. by wliat are called IVrsoual Liberty laws, and the refusal of the tjo V' ruor* of S"T?r?l of those states to surrender fugitive irotn justice from the slaveboldmg states in those cases in which (be crime imput*-d to the fugitive is the nbduc i ion or ktealiug of slaves Sinio further hglllallBII b.

For it is quit*- immaterial whether any grievance or wrong sustained at the hands of the c > States or by the action of (he federal government, Is set up to justify th' exercise of this right or not, masm ich as the p *>p|e of the secedltig -tate, under this theory, claim to be th ? ??o.e tribunal or Judg'-s to decide whether any such gre \ aie e or wrong has l<cen iullicted. and upon the tent and suAcwnc) of the wrong In fact, the theory of aecetwH'n implies the right of a State to di**olve its connection wi(h th? I'nion at discretion aud the whole question resolves itself into this whether the federal unn>n, as it now nbii, and as It was intended to be by its tramers, is anything more than a voluntary as?o i lation of states for common defence and other objects of vital importance pi their nterests sad prosperity , car r> *ng wiih it no binding obligation tipi? any on? of the states to yield < b?d ienee to the federal gotemtnent any longer than sin h State ?h uld consider it expedient. I propnee to enter into no elaborate argument to denv? -tr.ito tin' unsoundness o< (hi" th<siry and to show thai no sut h r ght was reserved by the > 'institution i ither t<i th" States or to the people.

The scheme of disunion, as I have reason to believe, lias been long cherished by some of these leaders, and they have only waited a pretest more plausible than anf here tofore presented to attempt the accomplishment of It. What between the inllainuiatory appeals ami highly colored and exaggerated story of wrong and oppression already endured, and the still more intolerable oppression to be anticipated from the fanatic spirit of the North, on the one hand, an<l the glowing pictures and seductive re presentations of the grandeur, power and prosperity of the new republic ou the other hand, U it not surprising that ? body of highly Oiftrxt men, strongly ''jxi'ed and carried along by ihetr own famiei, hate been able to mislead Many ihou tandt of a peiuliarly excitable and impressible population against the dictates if their t-ber judgment!. And it is a sad retlection that upon the s|>eedy return of this class of Southern citizens to wiser and more temper ito counsels may de|>eud the late of the I'nion. May uo hope be in dulged that a little time for calm thought will suffice for the chungo of what seems to be their present purpose and determination? ? a little time for retlection upon th nature and amount of evils which are certain to attend revolutionary movement, and also upon other and tnor appaling continent evils, which may and probably wil arise between its beginning and consummation. I do not forget that I ani addressing, through you brave men who are ready to die in vindication of their honor or iu defence ot" what they believe to be their rights: I do not appeal to their fears. But whatover may be the iltial decision of the people of Mississippi upon the gravest question evor presented to their consideration, and which must deeply affect the re lations existing between them and the (sviple of Tennes see, and of every other Suite of the South. I can not bring myself to the conclusion, all the existing evidences to tho contrary, that Mississippi will take upon herself tho responsibility of doing an act that would expose tho peace and security of her sifter States of the South to direct and imminent danger, an I perhaps decide their destinies lor weal or woe forever, without provious consultation with them, and tlrst exhausting every peace able mode of rodress for the grievances of which she complains. In a community of independent States or sovereignties, if any one of them should pursue a course whirh would put in imminent peril the peace and security of the other States, without ttr.-t exhausting every means of peaceable redrons for any grievances of which she might complain, they would be Justitled by tbe law of aatiou* in making common cause against her, and iu pre venting h'-r by force, if ncoeeury, from pursuing su-h courst S^ch being the responsibility attaching to the action of one ot a community of separate and independent Mates, how much greaer voult t-e the rrjponii'iiiity in rvrrid by one ot the Southern Ttilej of this Union, in adopt ing the detperaL- meaiwre tf breaking up the Uni m, an.

Could the evil conso quences certain to ensue b? con lined to th' State adopting the rash measure of secens.on, the other States might not feel called upon to protest against it. But that cannot be. Tho consequences ? and who can foresee their extent* ? must be felt by all. Vi< wing the subject in every light in which it can be presnted, I am oonstralnel to say that by no principle of public law, by no code of morals, by no law of earth or heaven, would Mississippi, or any other State, be .instilled, under existing circumstances, in withdrawing Irom the I'nion. 1 amjuie ntly bel ere that the kappt&t ion fetjvmt v would result fron a cmferenre of nil fh e Sou/hem states.

THK t' AI'Tl'KK. From what ChpUin (liffrey nays, It appear* that the prisoner, on hi* arrival at Susquehanna. Inquired for a resi dent of the place named Springstetn. Kurh.inan knew a brother of Spring! te In who worked In the Methodist l!?ok t'oocern in this city, and thought through this ac quaintance to make himself known in Susquehanna Spring* tela, on hearing of the Granger's arrival, songhl him out and to<'k him to his bouse. Buchanan waa tliaiikful for the hospitality evinced towards him, and after supper on gumlay evening ho proceeded to an oulbouae to sleep. While there Springslein noticxl that tho stranger's hands were cut. and that upon his re moving a bandage tbe wound* bled afresh. Then- cr cumstiuices . together with the somewhat agitated appear ance, excited the suspicion of th" host . and. after duly weighing the natter, h?> arrived at the conclusion that he was harboring the suspect t*l murderer of Mrs, Sbaucks. He accordingly repiilred to the offlee of Justice A. J. Seymour, and, making the necessary affidavit against the prisoner, had him arrested. Win n taken Into custody tbe prisonder si ined greatly agitated and trembled violently. Ho was asked If bo was not the person who killed Mrs. Shancks, when he re plied that he did not know such a person. .Subsequently, however, he admitted that he knew the demaaed, but dented all knowledge of the murder. He was placed In f!<*>e custody , and the authorities in this city were tele graphed to m relation to the matter as previously re ported. nt* mm nx wtm cat-tain cap purr.

Home of the wounds appeared still to give him much I* in, and he picked at them as if desirous to ex tract some painful foreign Bubstance. The left side of his face wus aiso scratched. He appeared entirely disinclined to converse. To a few general questions be returned eva sivo and unsatisfactory replies, and had ovideutly deter mined to say as little as possible. UK RKAI>8 TUB PAPERS. At Turner's, forty-seven miles from the city, the news boy s came on board with the morning papers. A copy of the Hkkai-d was handed to tho prisoner, and passing over all the other mutter without a glance, he literally devourtsl tho two articles relating to himself. As h? read them the muscles of his face twitched convulsively, and his countenance turned to a deadly pallor. As the train approached nearer and nearer to the city his agitation became extreme. No ono could look upon him and not feel pity for his condition, evon supposing him to bo guilty. And tho question would intrude itself: How could ono so young commit such a horrid crime? All along the route the excitement among the villagers was intense, and tho utmost curiosity was exhibited to catch a glimpse of the young carpenter who had rendered himself so notorious in connection with one of the most horrible murders that was ever perpetrated. Captain Catfrey was afraid of some popular outbreak, and accord ingly kept the prisoner as closely confined as possible. On the arrival of the train at .lersey City a large crowd assembled, in anticipation of his arrival. He was imme diately placed in a close carriage, and drivon by a cir cuitous route to tho ferry, the crowd running along in tho wake of the carriage. HIS AiTKARAM'E AT FOLIC ? nKADQCARTERS. During tho ?tny Buchanan's lather visited the General Superintendent's office and hail on interview with the prisoner. The pareut seemed very much atfhctod by the situation of his son, and gave vent to his feelings in tears. Mr. Buchanan said that tho prisoner was absent from heme on the night precoding the murder, tliat on FMday forenoon, about 11 o'clock , he appeared at the house with his bauds cut and bleeding, his i.ice scratched, and his clothes stained with blood. His mother, who was alarmed at his absence, n-ked him whore ho ha I been the previous night, and what had happened him. He tried to smooth over matters by saying that he h:id a dilliculty with some man tn Mercer street, and that the wounds were received in warding off blows aimed at him by his assailant. His excu-'o seemed a plausible one, and nothing more was thought ef the incident until Saturday morning, when Mr. Fuchanan, seeing an accouut of tno murder in the news papers, at once suspected that his son was in somo way implicated in the affair. Accordingly bo questioned the prisoner closely in relation to his cut hands and bloody clothing, but the latter s toutly denied all knowledge of i he murder, and reiterated his story about the light in Mereer street. Towards evening on Saturday the prisoner made some excuse about going down town on business , and taking his departure qui. tly left the city. Nothing more was heard of him by his parents until the new-i of his arrest arrived from tfemquebauna, on Monday, and it was not until the parents were thus assured of his flight that they were forced to belters in his guilt. When confronted with his father, yesterday, tho prisoner said that lie was on bis way to see an uncle of his who lived at Chicago when he was ar retted. Buchanan had previously told this story to the police, and in relating it a second time he varied but little. how ii* Accor>T? for ma WOCND3. When asked to a< count for the m aimed condition of his hands by the police, he st.ited that he mot a stranger who asked him to drink, that they went into a saloon and alter partaking of several drinks were about to leave, when they were insulted by one of the inmates. A row then ensued, he says, when he drew a knife todciend himsi '.f, and while doing so cut his hands. His hands bear no less than six cuts, s. >me of them appearing to have been indicted with a knife and others with a jagged edged instrument such as a piece of crockery. 'lho prisoner's laco is also scratched, as If with finger nails, and the injuries were no doubt' indicted quite recently. He says that these s< rati lies wi re also received in th<> barrix m tight, but his manner in accounting for the injuries was not straightforward or likely to i mpi ess the hearer with tho truth of the statement. During his detention at Police Headquarter-' Buchanan was visited by the District Attorney. Coroner .lackman .tint Mr. W illiam Smeaton, the son in-law of Mrs. Slianeks. At tour o'clock the prisoner was placed in a carriag" and conveyed to the Fifteenth prc< inct station house, where he was locked up lor lint remainder of the day. To day he will be brought before Onroner .lackman on the in quest and w hat disposition will be m.i le of him there r> mains to be s?.,n. Ilic feeling as to his guilt sgema to be universal. fThe evidence against him is purely circum stantial, but It is of such a iiatun that lew can believe the unfortuuato man Innocent. HISTORY OK Tint PRISONER, Alfred Ruehanan is a native oi this city, and is about twenty years of age. Ho is tall, slim built and light complcxioned, with a sini-ter am! rather bad expression of couut< nence. For years past he has been subject to fit*, and was much rcduceil in flesh in Moseqnenoe.
