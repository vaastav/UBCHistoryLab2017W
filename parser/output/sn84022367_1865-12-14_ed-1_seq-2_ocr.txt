V. THE RUTLAND WEEKLY UEltAXD, THURSDAY,' DECEMBER 14, 1805. RUTLAND HERALD. TnURSDAT, DECEMBER 1865.' ThankaglTlaff. The Btatc of Alabama Is the twenty, tevcnth that has ratified tui Constitu tional Amendment. "This makes three fourths of tho number df States that existed previous to the admission of Colorado. It Is. now understood that one more State is necessary, and If the "Alexandria ratification" be adopted by the Virginia Jslature now in session 8t Richmond, the requisite S?r -ill lave been obtained. It is morally cer tain that New Jersey will ratify at the earliest possible moment and in any event it Is perfectly clear that the doom Of slavery is forever sealed. . This day, therefore, the Seventh of December 18C5, Is a day of National Jubilee. From the Atlantic to the Pa cific, from the Lakes to the Gulf, our land is free. What the poet said of New England is now essentially true of the whole land ; ,. "No slave is here ; our unchained feet Walk freely as the waves that beat Our coasts." Is not this a cause of thankfulness 1 Everv one that rejoices In human pro gress and human rihta every one that has deplored t he misery una ut-giuu inn r tin. African slave every one that detests a proud and cruel aristo cracy must thankfully rejoice that the one has been disenthralled, the other humbled, ami the great cause of human advancement has been accelerated. We are also enjoying the luxury of peace. We can hardly indeed assure ourselves that the war is really ended. Our neighbors on the North and on the South are in a state of commotion. Wars and rumors of wars are heard in the distance, but they need not, and do not trouble us. We have conquered a peace among ourselves, aud doubtless we may enjoy it, and assuredly we ought to be thankful. No longer do we hear the calls for "500,000 more." There Is no more drafting no straining every nerve to raise bounties for recruits and substitutes ho drills, and marches and countermarches no heart rending de partures and leave-takings no crushing Bull Run defeats no more Gettysburgs and Winchesters no longer do the mel ancholy lists of casualties come pour ing in . upon us. There are no more Fort Pillows, Llbby Prisons or Ander- ' sonyllles. For all this let us be thank - ' ful. - ' ' Again we live In a most eventful pe riod, .The. history of a generation, a century, is crowded into one Olympiad, and eucn an Olympiad! What an arena ! ' What a prize at stake ! , What '. an. absorbing and breathless interest on the part of the observing millions! What alternations of hope and despond ency! What a glorious triumph at - last ! What themes for the Homers and the Xenonhons who shall in "winged - words" declare these exploits to future generations! Notwithstanding all the , .ntin-erin!rR. bereavements and losses of r- which almost every-household in this ; ;: land ahd this State has had a share, we ;.' ought to be.thankful that we are thus 0 counted worthv. 'Even a heathen could say "It is sweet 'and honorable to die ,v for one's country." It has, been our .v. nrivllece to' suffer and to triumph for the benefit of posterity and humanity. Our Autumnal Festival occurs this ' "rear .from ten ' to fourteen days later V than has been usual for bur New' Eng - land : Thanksgiving-r-but every one of those davs has furnished some addition 's al cause for thankfulness. Let us ob- . serve the day In an appropriate and be- cominrr manner. "Let.u8"noitorsai .'.." assembling of ourselves together" as be fits the members of a,ctiristian'commu ; nity, put join in exercises of praise and thanksgiving to the Author of all our ' 1 ' temporial and spiritual blessings. ' Doubtless also it is meet we should kill the fatted calf, make merry and be glad " with our friends; for in some sense nn.hwithr wpr dead and are alive VSU A. wivvuviu ' again ; were lost, and aTe found. f BBBArE to Gbn. Banks. A num- l ' berofthe citizens of Louisiana, now in Washington, headed by the uon Michael Halm, serenaded Gen. Banks Tuesdav night at the Ebbett House. Gen. Banks responded to the compli- " '' ment at some length. In the' course of , his remarks b.e spoke of the unity of : sentiment apparent in Congress against T the admission of Southern Oongress- " men, and approved the sentiments of the President's message tnat treason i r a crime and must be made odious, and ... rebellion forever rendered an impossi hilltv. He defended his course in Lou Isiana and declared that it had the full "! approval of President Lincoln. He ' : thought the future bright for the pro-,7-ir gress of freedom and humanity, and re 4 garded the President's message as an t admirable document: the constitution by apportioning Con gressional representation according to the number of voters, aud to allow ne groes to vote In the

Our city exchanges came to us yesterday af ternoon with extra sheets, and all freielited with the Message, and the Re ports of the different members of the Cabinet. Ou all sides we ilud nothing but the most unqualified expressions of approbation of the Message. The iluaucial editor of the New York Times says : "The admirable Message of the Presi dent of the United States will be fouud of great significance m strengtnening iluaucial confidence. Its hearty and determined support of the public credit; its proud survey of the resources of the country; its earnestness in favor of public economy aud enlarged and gener ous taxation, looking to the rapid liqui dation of the public debt ; its indorse ment of the early reduction of the army to a moderate peace establishment to cost less than forty millions a year, and Us entire freedom from anything like a hasty distrust or belligerent attitude, on our foreign relations, all unite to commend this great document to the re spect and warn! acceptance of the Mer chant, the Banker, and Fundholder, in common with people at large. The Dassaces in the message wnicn were applauded in the nouse during the reading were those asserting that trait ors should be punished, the offense made infamous, and at the same time the question judicially settled unany aud forever that no state of its own will has the right to renounce Its place In the Union ; that a tax on travel ana merchandise in their transit constitutes one of the worst forms of monopoly; and the evil is increased if coupled with denial of a choice of route, and the President's declaration that the justifi cation of Enalawl in fitting out cruisers during the rebelfion cannot be sustained before the tribunal of nations, and that the friendship between the two coun tries must herealter rest ou tne oasis oi mutual justice.

Grant arrived in Charleston on Friday last, and tiisentranee into the city was announced by artillery salutes. Very few of the white inhabitants were at the depot to welcome him ; but there was a large collection of the colored people, who cheered lutn enthusiastical ly.

The day of the Gene.als arrival was a holiday among the military, and iu the evening the colored population got np a torchlight procession nnd fireworks in his honor. On Saturday he gave a re ception to the cltidens, which was largely attended, and afterwards dined with Governor Perry, Governor Orr aud a large number of othr prominent men of the State.

In round numbers, they make the total amouny of old and new crop cotton 2,100,000sbales. They estimate the quantity JtJtally UnUC TO spinet not over 100,000 bales. They put down the number of bales yet to come from sec tions tributary to New Orleans, not in cluding Texas and Arkansas, at jwu.uuu bales. ' Billiards.

W." the corres- nondent of the Vermont Record gives the following biographical CoitoRB8S.--The joint resolution of: j fcred on Monday by Mr. Stevens of Penn svlvania. which, after a suspension of .

Notice was given of bidls to revive the grade of general in the army, to amend Cahamaw Smuggling. The Commis sioner or Customs is convinced, irom the character or the reports which he is daily receiving from the Canadian iron tier, that his action in employing female detectives there was judicious, and will be of great benefit in the exposure ana arrest of the female smugglers, who have recently been so extensively engaged in the contraband trade Detween uanaaa and the United States. Not one female smnsslernow crosses the line where twenty crossed before, and merchants alonsr the border, suspected or naving formerly been engaged in the contraband trade, are closing their stores and sell ins out. ' Another smnsclme dodge upon the Canadian border has just been detected. An "unusual number of coffins nave been brought across the line of late for inter ment on the American side. ' Last week the United States Revenue Officer in sisted upon " seeing the corpse," after the coffin was landed, against the ear nest protests of the stricken relatives, when, instead of a defunct body, the coffin was found filled with costly silks. Thb Release of Seddos and Ma- OBAth. The Savannah Republican gives the particulars of the release of J. a. Seddon. late War Secretary oi the Con federate States, and A. J . ftiagratn, ex- Governor of South Carolina, in compli ance with orders from the President. On Saturday, ,25th ult., Captain Clark H. Remlck, Provost Marsnai oi .savan nah, received instructions to proceed forthwith in the steamboat Starlight to Fort Pulaski, where both prisoners were detained, and set them at liberty. The order was duly obeyed. Capt. Remick having announced to the prisoners their release on condition of taking the am nesty oath, the news was received by both with joy and the oath freely taken. Gov. Magrath seemed in exultant health and spirits. He conversed freely on general topics during the trip to Savan nah and seemed heartily to enjoy the fine weather. Mr.1 Seddon, though not less cheerful, seemed to have held out with less force against the inroads which a long confinement must necessarily make upon the constitution of even the strongest man. He was pale, haggard and careworn.which gave a very gloomy and sad exnression to his regularly fnrmpd featnres. The first moments of excitement, In consequence of their hasty release, having passed away, towards the end of the trip both prisoners be came silent aud pensive, and all further efforts to draw them back to lively con versation proved unavailing. Death in the State Prison. The Boston Herald of Tuesday says : " Last Friday Arthur Laverv was sen tenced to three years' imprisonment in the Massachusetts State Prison at Charleston for the ronrdr of John M. Mario w. whom he stabbed in the eye a few weeks ago. Lavery was in feeble health at the time of his sentence, and this morning died, thus quickly taking an anneal from the sentence of man to the Court where Justice never once swerves from the right track." sketch of Beniamin II.

Mr Carljle having been elected rector of the uuiversity of Ediuburg, the London Spectator coucocts the following speech, which it supposes him to address to the students of the university, In which his grotesque style is admirably taken oil'; "I am credibly Informed, my young brothers and lVllow-learuers, that a worthy friend of mine, with discern ments quite beyond the common, has In these present times undertaken to teach you of this university somethlng(ainong others) that men call rhetoric and let tersutterances of great men in thin common tongue of ours, aud the power resulting thence to all true learners among you, with leave of favoring na ture, of distinctly articulating such word of God as may be in you: if such word be already there. If such word be already there ! here is the grand con dition of all true ultcrauce, without which rhetoric professors, with huge midwife apparatus of various discern ments, can do nothing for you but de liver you of-dark, extensive moon calves metaphysic abortions, wnie-conea mon strosities of ineffable '.oolishness, such as it were better for the world, not hitherto to have seen. Rhetoric profes sors, my young brothers, of howsoever various discernments, can at most help you to articulate such true word as may be in each of you, and n, in your cnaot 1c, yeasty llounderiugs of blind desire you canuot yet find such word, may in stead thereof surely help yon to lose such word, beyond hope of ultimate finding, in froth oceans oi logical jar gon, dismal science formulas, aud scsl ences 'called pure." In which too pos sible case, not I, but the solemn fact of the universe, must warn you, at peri of drowning forever in said froth-oceans of logical jargon, to desist from long eared hallelujahs and laudatory psalm ody, to middle-class education, sciences called pure,' university extension, aud the like, and retire into the silences, till you can catch some audioie wnisper oi an everlasting yea announcing, as with a clap of thunder, what sort oi Douy pil grimage nature ana met nave unjuiueu upon you, under peril of your soul, iu this distracted universe to pursue." the
