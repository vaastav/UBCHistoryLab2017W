TO 088 EBIENBB IR OOHDONSVILLE AND ADJOINING COUNTIES, in presenting you the first number •ofthe Native Virginian from this point, we have naturally a few suggestions to make, A portion of them are so point edly and torcibly set fortli in a Western paper, that we give the entire extract. Discussing the subject of "tlie local pa per," our contemporary says. "What tells us so readily the standard of a town or a city as tiie appearance of its paper? And its youth M Its age can as well be determined by tlie observing as by a personal notice. The enter prise ol its citizens is depicted by it* advertisements, their liberality by tlie looks of the paper. Some paper* show a good, solid, healthy foundation, ple thoric purses, and a well-to-do appear ance generally; others show a striving to contend with the grasping thousands at omul theni, trying hard to wrench an existence irom their cloae-tlsted ccm nuinities. An occasional meteoric dis play in its columns of tehgraph or lo cal, or ef editorial, showi what It can do if it had the means; but it can tint continue iv the expensive work unti; support conies, which ought to be read ily granted. A newspaper is iiko a church—it wants fostering in the coni mt-ino men t, aml for a few yens; then, Si a general thing, it can walk alone, and icllect ei-edit upon its location. Take your home paper—it gives you more newi of immediate interest than any other psper can possibly do; it talks for you when otberlocalities belie you; It stands up for your rights; you always have a champion in your home paper ; aud thine who stand up for you should certainly bo well sustained. Your in terests are kimired and equal, and you must rise or fall together. Therefore, it is to you? interest to mpport your home paper, not ftrudrjingly, b\t in a liberal spirit; as a pleas ure, not as a disagreeable du.y, bit as a;. IHVESTUENT THAT WILL AMPLr PAT TUB tXf rSNIHTIBE." We have but littlo to add to this.— Our aim is to give you a live, bright, useful and inlluential paper—one that will do credit to this section of the State, and add to your population and wealth. Advertisements and subscrip tions we need, of course ; without them there can be no paper. Every adver tisement helps the publisher, ar.d eve ry subscriber help* the advertiser even wore than tha publisher. Hut what we dceire especially is tlie county news of Orange, Greene, Madison and Louisa. Give us that. Lo not, think anything too small. Whatever is of sufficient in terest to make two men stop in the street and talk will interest a thousand readers. Give us the new* ot these four counties, and we ptoml«e you one ol the best country papers in Ihe Stats or •We inter d to devote ourselves to the material interests of this town aud sec tion. The site is favorable tor au in- Issd town of -considerable magnitude, and our excellent soil and superb cli mate will bring abundant immigration. Year by year it will increase. We liavetiere tlie junction of two of tlie most important railroads In tho United States, and to these will soon be added a third—the road to Winchester—and perhaps a fourth. The place is bound to grow. We wantto hasten its growth, to grow and prosper with it, and to this end shall exert our titmoit powers. Wn lhall advocate not only the railroad which the citizens of Greeneand Madi lon io much need, but a syeteio of first rate county roads, branching off from this town, as well. Whatever etiter priie has for its object tho material, moral and intellectual welfare of out people, lhall receive our cordial sup port. Our ambition is to thrive by their thrift, to prosper in Iheir prosperi ty. We have no aeparate, petty s lflsh Interest to subserve. That you are not rich and that you cannot do all that you would like to do for the paper, we know full well. But the diipoiition is everything. Take a real interest in the paper, and show it by your acts. Come, then ; let us join hands, heads and hearts, and -we will make the Native Virginian a success and Gordonsville a great success.

The National Board of Trade had em phatically a good time in Hichmond.— I'he people of that city know how to entertain, and their Northern guest* Went away completely lascinat-d.— Much benefit to the mateiial interest oi the State will be sure to follow.

The Harpers, we believe, do not er gage in holiday publications, but we venture the assertion that there, is not a gilt book issued this season which will give more intense pleasure to youths than this volume of Mr. Greenwood's.

We have known this fellow, I'imes, for two a-id forty years, and during that entire period he ha* been tight.— lie is always tight. A man named Baldwin seems to have met him once in Alabama when he was Hush ; hut aa a rule, especially 111 Virginia, he is inva riably tight. During the war, lie was on a tremendous "bust," and new he is almost as tight ss hu was then. .Some times he is called Hard Times tor short. He is a wcll-mesuing fellow, aud at in tervals does his best to relorni. But. it is no use—he will get tight again. He lias been getting worse for the last month or so, and i« if possible tighter than ever. Indeed, he is very tight.— He is as tight as a drum—tight as a tick --tight as bricks—light as the Emperor Titus when lie took Jerusalem, lie is really tight. People abuse the poor creature, but what good docs that do? He is on a bender—on a tear—o:l a high old drunk. He lias got the horrors—the delirium t>-ian&le_--und he sees snakes. Fact is, Times is 111 a bad way; he can't stand this much longer; he'll go up ; it'll be the last ot him ; and we feci very sorry for him. Poor old Times ! He's pow'ful tight. BEPUBLICAN PABIY IN VIKU.NI&. A Washington correspondent ofthe Itiehmond Whig makes the following announcement: "The future attitude ol parties lv Virginia is much talked 01. One thing is certain; the restoration of Virginia sounds the death knell of the party names now in vogue in Virginia. There can be no longer a Walker party a Withers party, a Wells party, or any other man's party.
