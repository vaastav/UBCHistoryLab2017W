Entered as second-class matter at Newark, Del., under Act of March 3, 1879 The subscription price of this paper is $1.00 per year in advance DECEMBER 9, 1914 TO THE REPUBLICAN OFFICE- ! HOLDERS I be The following editorial is clipped The from the Evening Journal, issue of be December 8 : day. The Evening Journal is a Repub- check lican newspaper, but it is not a party organ. see There is no Republican in our State who is too small to receive who praise from it for any act that is check promotive of public good. There is no Republican in our ers State who is too large to receive j public censure from it for any act | and that is productive of public harm, j cion We take the stand that a Repub- of lican who is elected to office has j for three important duties to perform, and The first is to commit no official act that will be injurious to the ary public. make The second is to commit no offi- the cial act that will bring discredit to i the party that has honored him. cal The third is to commit no official ! act that will stultify him as an in dividual in the eyes of the people. J When any Republican office-j holder does violence to any of those j " duties, we believe we perform a I the valuable service to the public and I fi to the party by calling attention to I the fact and demanding that, for j the sake of the public and the j party, he repair, so far as it may rl p be possible, whatever harm he lias "' done, and refrain from future dis- ! creditable acts. [, ^ The very least that can be done |* U!V by a man who has been elected to | U P office by the Republican party is to ! * Ion be honest. The very best that can ! be done by him is not only to be ! ^ honest but also to be constructively i tlon and obstructively useful. In other ou ^ words, to construct the good and f "? to obstruct the bad things in pub- a " jj e jj£ e ment Above all other things, a Repub lican who has been honored by his P party should live up to the pledges i that his part v organization made ; ' not would to the people as an act precedent to his election. As a public official such a Republican is the repository I of the good faith of his party. It is his duty to be true to that trust. ; Such thoughts are aroused by the fact that the new year is rap-(sewer idly approaching; that a new Leg- j ports, islature controlled by Republicans, j has soon will assemble in Dover, and j for that a new Levy Court, controlled : by Republicans, soon will assemble | stand in this city. Republican members-elect of the i j by Legislature must bear in mind that the Republican party has promis- ( the ed that the forthcoming legislative ence session shall be short and that its ; other predominant characteristics shall | be the intelligent and business-like ; with dispatch of the people's affairs. It been is the duty of those members to en- ( able the Republican party to live up to that pledge. They should go ing to Dover fully determined that the SO session shall not exceed beyond the the sixty-day limit and that it shall be made even shorter if business pru- ; dence should seem to warrant it. j With no extraordinary event, like the election of a United States Sen a tor, to disturb the course of gen eral legislative business, the Repub lican majority can offer no accept able excuse for a prolonged session. Nor can it shift the responsibility for such a session to the Democra tic minority. The Republican ma-jcide, jority will have the power to decide , when the session shall end. There can be no division of responsibility 1 it if it fail to end within a reasonable ! right clear time. Bo much for the Legislature. ! Now for the New Castle County I Levy Court. Through it the Re publican party organization has j tasks promised to give to the taxpayers a ( the clean honest, economical and husi- j war. ness-like administration of every! Republican member of that court I to do his utmost to enable the party J to keep that promise. There must duty. be no violating or stretching of the law for the benefit of anybody, of The good name and fair fame of the party are of infinitely greater importance than is tne pecuniary interest of any man in the county. If, in the past, there have been any allowances of county funds for in creased salaries or other purposes, it is the duty of the commissioners to let it be known at the very out set of their new administration that there will be no more of such things They should live within the law and compel all who have business with them to live within it so far as it may affect either the treasury or the general interests of the. county. not and the act, kind. way ed best i ! Further than that, there should I be no star-chamber proceedings. The business of the county should be transacted in the broad light of day. Each bill passed and each check drawn should be open to the inspection of anyone who wishes to see it. No one who presents or passes an honest bill and no one who draws or signs an honest check has anything to fear from public scrutiny. Our commission ers must bear in mind that public j crookedness fattens upon darkness | and secrecy and that public suspi j cion always stands close to the door of the star chamber. Therefore, j for the sake of the public, the party and themselves, the commissioners should begin their work in Janu ary with a firm determination to make a record that will withstand the most critical scrutiny of any i taxpayer, no matter to what politi cal party h emay belong. ! - THE
