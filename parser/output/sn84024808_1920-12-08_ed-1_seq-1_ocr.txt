S. infantry, alleged thief and deserter, after his arrest here Tuesday night charged with absconding $5,000 of his company's funds December 10, WIS. His regiment was then sta tioned at Camp Sevier. Greensville, S. C. His capture was accidental. He was crossing Fifth avenue at 42nd street when Hugh J. Hannigan. formerly a first lieutenant in Willer's company, recognized him. Hannigan called a po liceman and Willers was arrested. At a police station the prisoner was fur ther identified by two other former lieu tenants in company I, Sidney P. Howell and Francis Hatch. Willers was then taken to Governor's island, headquart ers of the second army corps, and placed in confinement at Fort Jay. Espionage Cadet. Willers, the police said, recited in a brazen fashion how he was sent to the United States as one of 300 cadets trained in the acts of espionage, to en ist in the American army. On his arrival in the United States Willers went to Albany where he enlist ed, he said, as a private. His military aptitude won him rapid promotion and his knowledge of English and his ability to "speak like an American" enabled him to obtain a commission . Willers said he had never been sent across the ocean and while in this coun try his instructions were "to act the part of a loyal American" and to take no action until he reached the war zone. Lead Men to Slaughter. "What was your plan after reaching the other side?" he was asked. "I could lead the company to slaugh ter," the police say he replied. "You also would be killed," he was reminded. "What of that? Thousands of better men died that way." While being questioned at the police station, the police say Willers remarked that they would be surprised if they knew "the number of officials at Wash ington during the war who were em ployed by Germany as spies." "Are they still there?" he was asked. "That I don't know," he is said to have answered. "But. there were many of them dur iug the war." Took Funds of Company. The 48t.h infantry was still at Camp Sevier when the armistice was signed and as his usefulness as a spy was at an end, Willers told the police, he de cided to become a deserter and to take, they alleged, the funds of his company. The deserter then went to Chicago where, about a year ago, he married a young American woman named Craw ford. From Chicago, Willers roamed about the country, at various times in his travels trying unsuccessfully to get a passport, to Germany. He disguised himself and waited an opportunity to quit the country. j Monkey Gland to Save Deformed Girl's Life, Belief of Physicians Joliet, III., Dec. 7.—Mary Zeem bek, 19, who lived 17 years in a cel lar, where she had been relegated by her parents because she was de formed. has a fighting chance to re gain her health, physicians said Tuesday.

ECONOMY, REVISION OF TAX LAWS, WORKABLE BUDGET SYSTEM RECOMMENDED Full Text of President Wilson's Annual Message Will Be Found on Page 16 of This Edition of The Great Falls Tribune.

Independence for the Philippines. A loan to Armenia. Economy in government appropriations and expenditures and creation of a "workable budget system." Cold storage and other laws affecting the cost of living, and the federal licensing of corporations as recommended in previous messages. Rehabilitation and training of disabled soldiers and sailors. Inference to League of Nations. The president did not indorse a bonus. Nowhere did the president refer to the League of Nations or the peace treaty fight, except perhaps by inference in his opening when he quoted Abraham Lincoln's "Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we under stand it." At its close the president wrote a paragraph which might be regarded as a vale dictory, saying: "I have not so much as set before you a series of recommendations as I sought to utter a confession of faith, of the faith in which I was bred and which it is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day. I believe this to be the faith of America, the faith of the future, and of all the victories which await national action in the days to come, whether in America or elsewhere." Democracy Put to Final Test. "Democracy," the president said, "is being put upon its final test. The old world," said he, "is suffering from a wanton rejection of the principles of democracy and a substitution of the principles of autocracy as asserted in the name but without the authority and sanction of the multitude. This is the time of all others when democracy should prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail." Two ways "in which the United States can assist to accomplish this great object" were outlined by the president. They were: First: By offering the example within her own borders of the will and power of democracy to make and enforce laws which are unquestionably just and which are equal in their administration * * * * Second: By standing for right and justice as towards in dividual nations. The United States." said the president, "cannot refuse this role of cham pion without putting the stigma of rejection upon the great and devoted men who brought its government into existence." Transmitted by White House Messenger. The president's message was transmitted by messenger, the president adhering to his decision not to address congress in person. The message was not read immediately in the senate, not until it had disposed of routine business. Secretary Tumulty was among the spectators in the senate, occupying a seat on the floor. Public galleries were filled and several diplomats were present. The house listened to the reading of the message in silence until it was concluded, when the Democrats arose and applauded. There was some applause also from the galleries wher crowds had gathered in anticipation of the possibility that Mr. Wilson might decide to read his communication in person. In the senate, arrival of the White House messenger with an armful of communications including some 17,000 recess and other appointments and with the announcement "several messages in writing from the president" caused laughter on the floor. Debate on farmers' relief measures was in progress and it was half an hour before the clerk began reading the president's message senators following the reading from printed copies placed in their hands earlier. Certificates Issued Sale Against Receipts Would Re lieve Dilemna, Says Lever. Indianapolis, Dec. 7.—Establishment of warehouses throughout the country of sufficient capacity to permit even distri bution of farm products during the en tire year was night before the anuual convention of the American Farm Bureau federation by A s bur y Lever, a member of the federal farm loan board, as a permanent safe guard for the farmer against big declines in prices. His plan included sale by the government of certificates issued against the warehouse receipts, which, he said, would give ready money to the farm producers. "Given such a system of marketing," declared Mr- Lever, "the next census will show a drift of population country ward, instead of city-ward." In addition to advocating the ware house plan, Mr. Lever suggested the for mation of foreign trade corporations, under the Edge act. ns a relief for the farmers in their present financial situa tion. The warehouse pian, he said, promised the better permanent benefits for the farmers.

The shipments with these of the. lastt day and 5,000,000 bushels more than can be placed aboard ships now in the harbor before navigation closes, arc expected to bring the season's total to about 50, 00,000 bushels. M. N. Patterson, former member of the Canadian wheat board, expressed the opinion Tuesday that the large shipments now being made are a result of efforts by Canadians to dispose of as much of their wheat as possible before any action is taken by the United States, either in the way of import dues on wheat or flour or by an embargo.

Dairy Company Guilty of Doctoring Rancid Butter; Officers Freed Portland, Dec. 7.—The Hazlewood Dairy Products Co., of Portland, dealers in dairy products and poultry, was found guilty by a juxy in federal court Tues day on two charges on manufacturing adulterated butter without complying with government regulations regarding tax and sale. None of the officers of the company will be liable to punishment as individuals it was announced. The charge was based* on complaint j that the concern reduced several hun dred pounds of rancid butter by use of j lime and soda and placed some of it ; on the local market as creamery butter, T > Expressing the desire of the federal reserve board to do everything it prop«' erly can to help the farmers in their present predicament. Governor Harding declared it was impossible for any "banking system to provide funds fotf withholding all staple crops entirely from the marked for any length of time." Some agricultural products, Mr. Hard ing said, may not be salable at any price, and as they must be carried over fop account of oue, "they had better be car« ried for the account of the producer." Diversified Crops Suggested. He suggested that the federation con sider co-operative marketing, greater dl ■ versification of crops, and the maturing i of farmers' obligations over periods ex tending from October to Mardi as a means of preventing a pepetition of pres ent conditions. Discussing apprehension on the par* of farmers as to their current indebtness, Governor Hardirg said that in his opin ion, if the farmer would go to his banker and make a frank statement of Ma con dition. agreeing to make orderly sales of his producta as the market develops, he would be able to make arrangements for present pressing needs and for the requirements of another season. Law of Supply and Demand, "1 shall not undertake to predict the course of prices, but I will say that prices are relative end that barring the shortages prices of all commodities will rise and fall together," he added. While the decline in prices of the goods the farmer has to buy has not been commensurate with the slump which has taken place with respect to his own pro ducts, there is every reason tt> believe that within a short time inequalities will adjust themselves—either the price of farm products will advanace or the price of other goods will decline. Thus In the event that there is no substantial lm-t provenment in the price of farm product« it seems ceitain that the cost of pro^ during next year's crops will be greatly reduced." Warns of Makeshift Relief. Warning against, advocating measure* for temporary relief without consider- 1 ing their ultimate results, Governor» Harding declared: "One of the most effective utterance» of the president -elect during the recenft campaign was his statement that he fa -i vored more business in government and; less government in business." We must( remember that wartime measures arw not generally adopted to peace condi-t tions. but no matter what the course o£ legislation may be, the solution of our economic and financial problems will de pend mainly upon individual 'jfforts, and cells for good judgment and Corebearanc«,, self-reliance and co-operation, 8n<! a dis-* play of courage and optimism, which af ter all is really justified by fundamental conditions." « sachusetts. the Republican leader
