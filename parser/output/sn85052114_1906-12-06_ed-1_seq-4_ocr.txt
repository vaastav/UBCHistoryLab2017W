Notary Public My commission expires January 22 1908 I Dally Thought t Choose sunny ways and a speech frank bonest and charitable to tho uttermost 4 1 0 CURRENCY REFORM At last the prospects ot the much needed currency reform are bright ened as tbo shadow of unreasonable prejudice recedes For many years currency legislation especially legls lotion for the purpose of making the currency elastic was regarded with an antipathy of long standing the i companion to the severe attack of anglophobia with which the nation t was stricken a few years back Sug gestlons of bankers that some reme dy should bo afforded for a condition 1 which caused fluctuating rates were regarded with the same suspicious that attended arguments of physl clans In favor of better sanitation iPeoplo coudnt understand why a 1 tanker should desire reasonable eta j ble rates of Interest any more than they could figure out why a doctor Y should desire healthful conditions The simple fact Is that bankers and doctors are affected by whatever af 4 fects the wholo community and In the same way Unhealthful physical and r financial conditions epidemics and excessive rates ot Interest afflict them as they do the rest of us Few people In fact have understood the C financial situation Elastic curren r cy and automatic system are t s terms we pass by as technical We t hear of 30 per cent for call loans in N w York We hear of the money V needed to move the crops of tho west and lead About the New York panics Jmnortlng 10000000 In gold from Europe Then we lean back with u sigh of contentmentsat Jsfled With the majestic proportions of the figures notwithstanding tho I fact that ten times 10000000 would no more than suffice In a pan c The secretary of the treasurer i comes to tho aid of the banks and l Deposits money After awhile he has rto come out In a statement to the Dress anoclatlon that he wont de poslt any more money fV d Tho truth Is money like every i other commodity goes after profits tTherb Is Just BO much money In ex I iitcnce and it has to be visibly used 1 In cash tiantactlons Tho farmers I i > of the west must have tho cash So J l B tho fall the gold dollars and the 1 v silver dollars engage in a grand rush 1 for the western plains draining New I York and the Importation from Eu I I J PPO and deposits by tbo government I ifVegin Up go Interest rates and pres I presently c 28 per cent Back rushes the money 1 Jt ram tho wOst to Nt > w York pelt moll I And as the tide ebbs and flows obey f jAg conditions that aro as certain I ltsitd regular as the movements of I i the planets the Interest rates over the country rise and fall In response I Money is tight they say and we IIknor what that means kK1 example of tho necessity t i i f for ready cash at certain times of the I year Is afforded lu the situation right now Tobacco Is coming Into the I warehouses every day and cash must be paid on delivery It Is I ufo to say that the ijoitUvllle tanks aro sending a half million dollars a day to Inter for points to pay for tobacco Now the fame money Is needed to do ho I ordinary business of the bank with An elastic currency simply moans a system by which the actual currency of the bank can be expanded In these annual exigencies for the accommo dation of the customers The bankers association proposes I that they bo allowed to Issue notes I to a certain per centor their capital under the direction of the treasury department the tax on these notes I being high enough to drive the notes back to the banks when not actually needed President Jloosevelt calls this reme dy to the attention of congress but makes no recommendation further than to ask that some remedy bo ap plied o We favor a ship canal from the 6Lakes to the gulf but our enthusi 9asm Is tempered with selfishness We I 2Are not up to the standard of those I broadminded publicspirited citi zens of St Louis and Chicago who are working to divert = 3000000 of 8the rivers and harbors appropriation 7Into the canal channel We actually are so base as to favor blowing the I money In to promote a nine foot t tp channel In the Ohio river That ship I canal is a dream of future decades when It comes to damming and con trolling the current of the Mississip pi but year around navigation on the Ohio river is a thing of present t need oJ o The London Standard In com menting on the presidents message says the most significant feature Is that tho president Inconstantly find ing himself up against the American Constitution Well that is what It is there tOI Mr Roosevelt Is a little Impatient of delays quick to decide and quick to act If he did not en counter an obstacle in the constitu lion once in a while the rest of us would be breathless trying to keep JteepI I up with him We are Inclined to t think that Mr Roosevelt and the constitution will get along all right i together O 1 John Wesley Galnes has Introduc ed a bill Increasing the salary of aI I congressman to
