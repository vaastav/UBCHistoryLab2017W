[Farmers and Drovers Journal.] I Having bought something high in price, and standing to lose heavily, cattle feeders are siiii niiuwium keen anxiety to get rid of a big pile of warmed-up and short-fed 1,100? to 1,40-0 pound steers. Heavier weights are slowing down among the receipts, but the excessive supplies of other grades landed on the Monday market point well the gloomy feeling which pervades feeders owning those classes. Market has gone down naturally ua der pressure of excessive supplies. That it will go still lower unless a check is put on liquidation is the gen eral belief. It is largely a $5.25@6.00 market for medium to good quality sixty to 100-day fed steers now, and cattle which have had corn for a con siderably longer period have to sell at *6.00® 6.25. Choice heavy steers are making the latter price, and only a class bordering on prime grade goes above $6.50. Prices for these are lowest In many months. Conservatively stated, such cattle are selling $2 lower than best time of this year and -are off $1.75 from high point only a few weeks ago. The desire to ship Is gripping feeders strongly and decline is laid entirely to big supply. There is now need for a halt in ex cessive shipping. Beef trade la such that considerably shorter supplies would suffice but the packers are keenly enjoying their innings at price cutting, since .beef is being bought on a basis which well affords storage of much of it for future use. The situa tion permits the killers to lay in a surplus beef stock for use when heavy winter liquidation is over. Sixty days more of big run* will give them a sup ply of cheap beef coolers as a leverage for use when market once gets start ed the other way. That reaction will coune before many weeks is the conDdent bdlef among traders, since a heavy proportion of the season's short-fed crop can not long come in such big volume as the trade has had in reeant weeks. Feed ing out the steers, eanen In face of present low market prices, is not deemed bad policy, since com is rea sonably cheap and there is a record crop on hand. In fact, many look upon It as a way of saving toad losses, which must come if hope la further aban doned. Kansas City Livestock.

FIGURES OF PRESIDENT TAFT AND COMMITTEEES DISAGREE Executive'a Measage to Congress Lad to Belief That Billion Mark Would Not Be Reached But Appropriationa Com* mitteea Present a Different Basis of Eatimatea. [Special Correspondence.] Washington, Dec. 14.—Members of congress who were Interested in that portion of President Taft's message dealing with the governmental esti mates for the fiscal year 1912, and who believed that at last congress would get away from its billion dollar session reputation, have had something of a shock in looking over the financial statement issued by the house and senate appropriations committee. Instead of getting away from a bil lion dollar session congress will come within $1,000,000 of that mark before the adjournment on March 4 if it does nothing but enact into law the esti mates sent to it by the various branch es of the government. In his message to congress on Dec. 6 the president said: "The final estimates for the year ending June 30, 1912. as they have been sent to the treasury, on Nov. 29. of this year, for the ordinary expenses of the government, including those for public buildings, rivers and harbors, and the navy building program, amount to $530,454,013.12. This is $52,964,887.36 less than the appropriations of the fis cal year ending June 30, 1911. It is $16,883,153.44 less than the total esti mates, Including supplemental esti mates. submitted to congress by the treasury for the year 1911 and is $5. 574.659.39 less than the original esti mates submitted by the treasury for 1911." Where the Difference Lies. President Taft's statement of the fi nances of the government differs from that of the appropriations committees of congress in that he does not treat with the government expenditures as a whole. The statement prepared by these committees, dealing with these government expenditures as a whole, and based on the book of estimates sent to congress by Secretary MacVeagh, show that the aggregate appropriations called for aggregate $999,148,805.81, a ret Increase over the appropriations for 1911 ^exclusive of deficiency and mis cellaneous) of $7,251,520.17. A compari son of the estimates sent to congress this year with those submitted a year ago shows that this year's estimates call for $21,023,036 more than the esti mates for the fiscal year 1911. The discrepancy between President Taft's flgnres and those of the appropriations committee Is to be found in the fact that President Taft deals only with the ordinary expenses of the government. Thus, he eliminates about $S8,000.000 called for in the sundry civil appropria tion bill for th* Panama canal: ap proximately $61,000,000 for the sinking fund acrnunt, and about $250.000 000 which will be carried In the postolTIce appropriation bill. Excludes Panama Canal. Members of congress agree with President Taft that the Panama canal Js an extraordinary expenditure and so lone as he deals only with ordinary ex penditures he may safely exclude about $58,000,000. The postofflce expendi tures are treated as a balanced account, notwithstanding the fact that congress must first appropriate about $250,000, 000. and money collected hv the depart ment being turned back Into the treas ury later on. The $61,000,000 for the sinking fund, however, members of congress assert should be Included in the ordinary expenditures of the gov ernment. so that this more than wipes out the $58,000,000 reduction In the es timates mentioned by President Taft In his message. Prom the standpoint of members of economy who are anxious to have a session of real economy the most sig nificant fact In connection with the passage of appropriation bills is that the estimates call for appropriations: of $68,403,850.81 in excess of the estimat ed revenues.

Washington, Dec. 14.—Arguments on •the evidence adduced at the freight rate hearings were commenced today be fore the interstate commerce commis sion. After the completion of the argu ments, the commission will take up the actual consideration of the case pre paratory to announcing what will be the most Important decision It has ever been called upon to hand down. The rate hearing was commenced on the request of shippers who protested when western railroads announced that rates on fifty different commodities would be increased. Opposition to the advance became general all over the country, and the shippers and the rail roads aligned themselves in battle ar ray for one of the big fights of the new century. The transportation compan ies were forced to postpone the rate advance until such time as the inter state commerce commission had con ducted a full and fair hearing on the fairness of the proposition. Chicago and New Tork were the scenes of the hearings, conducted at first by examiners, but later, owing to the great importance of the case, by members of the commission. The ship pers contented themselves with Intro ducing very litUe evidence, centering their efforts upon attacks upon the great mass of evidence piled up by the railroads. It was admitted by representatives of the railroads that tho advance on fifty selected commodities was but an enter ing wedge for general freight rate in creases all along -the line. According to tho shippers, the result of the rail road policy, If permitted to bo carried out, would be to place an additional tax of $40,000,000 annually upon the consumer, already overburdened and grtfmbllng at the high cost of living. It Is alleged that while the increase would make the railroads highly pros­ */& perous and benefit the holders of rail way securities, it would be tho last straw upon the backs of the people at large. One prophet asserted that In stead of one socialist In congress, there will be a hundred within a few years If the "rapacity" of the railroads to not checked. The arguments of the railroads, brief ly summarized, are. to the effect that increases in rates are made necessary by the Increased wages of employes, the Increased cost of maintenance and operation, and the public demand for increased efficiency and expansion of transportation facilities. The position of the shippers is that the railroads are now receiving a gen erous return upon their actual invest ment, minus water, and among the ar guments to be advanced the chief one is that the low rate of earning shown in the railroad statistics is due more to overcapitalization than to low rates.
