It' to-day'* lariLUUkNCKU be louud dull, blame the Weeident, who did It with his litlli) pan. Under tho chubiUlng rod of a menage of more thau 10,000 words we can only be grateful tg the President that he has given us no more o! it. The Iktu-uuicm'su glv<s up to the mes sage the required apace because it is the custom, but it is to be hoped that one of tlitad days Oiera may arise a President who will break through the bad custom of sending to (longrees long annual mes sages. The happenings of a twelvemonth in ordinary times do not require so elaborate treatment, nor Is it to be sup posed that the people demand of the President once a year qulto so much of the fundamental principles of government applied to ovary question which he may think well to treat. Theblue peuoil in a tmpitWrhand would have improved the msssoge by knocking out at least half of It. It is a mistake tor auy President to think he is heard for his much ipe?kln<. Thu President's message contains good thing* and bad. As a literary production it canuot be called otiur than common plsc". Ai a State paper it nowhere rises above the deal levol of inedloclty. It contains no ideas that will Burvive the oc casion, It Is sound on the money quej question, drops the Cutting case as though the Administration had dis abled its pen in the gigantic contest with lloxico, and treata Civil Service re form in a way that ia not leas than gro tesque whon it is remembered that the President has deported from his pledges whenover the humor was on him. The measaio takes the free tradj view of the tariff question, us Mr. Oar lisle or Mr. Morrison would take it if either wf-ro President. Tho Presi dent maintains that a tariff on im ports is nec o-earlly a ten paid by the con sumer to tbo American manufacturer; that tlie way to reducacustomsievenuesis to furthor reduce the tariff rotes. He as sures the farmer that tbo manufacturer is plundeting him, and holds up before him pitiful picture of his tax-ridden home which will water with tears the land of tvjry American firmer. 'The wage-farm r employed in manufac turing Industries in told that the pressnt protective system wrongs him greatly. All this the President would remedy by reducing duties in order to allow greater freedom of Importation. The farmer being robbed by the manu facturer of giasB, earthenware, Iron, stool, fabrics and the like, tho President would cut down the dutios on all theso products and lake from no man engaged in produc ing them any work or any wages. H? would extract suushlno from cucum bers. Tut President does not Beom to under stand that revenues can bo cut down by increasing dutios and to that extent dio cjurAi',ing tbo purchase of foreign wares that ought to glvo work and wages to American workman. He does not easm to understand that manufactured articles never were eo cheap in this country as they aro to-day. If the President desired to furnish till Kepubllcaa party with good campaign mateilal he has achieved a brilllut suc cess. Republicans can well afford to meet liltn on his pwn ground, and on that go to the country. JiKWH I.N

The cruel treatiueut of InoQenaive Chinese hap, I regret to aay, been repeat ed in some of the far Weatern States and Territories and acta of violence against those people beyond the power ol the local constituted authorities to prevent ami difficult to puuiah are reported, even in distant Alaska. Much of this violence can ba tracoJ to race prt j idtce and com petition oi labor, which caonot, however, [natity the oppression of strangers, whose safety Is guaranteed by oar treaty with China, equally with the most favored nations. In opening our vast domain to alien el ement?, the pnrpoae of our law givers was to Invite aaalmilatlon and not to provide an arena for audleia antagonism. The paramount duty of maintaining public order and defending tho interest" of onr own people hiay require the Adop tion of meaeuree of restriction, but they should not tolerate the io.preaaion ol in dividuals of a special race. 1 am not without assurance that the government of China, whoso friendly disposition towards us, I am most happy to recognize, will meet ns half way in devising a compre hensive remedy by which effectivelimita tion of Chiui ae emigration, joined to the protection uf ihose Chinese subjects who remain in this country, may be secured. Legislation la needed to execute the pro visions of our Chinese convention of 18S0a touching the opium trafllo. While the good will of tho Cqlijmt|)sn J government towards car uountry'ls tinni est, the situation of American interests on the Isthinns of Panama haa at timea excited concern and invited the friendly actlona looking to the performance of the engagements of the two uatlona concerning tho territory embraced in the inter-oceanic transit. With the subsidence of the Isthmian disturbances and the erection of tho Stale of Panama to a fed-; eral district under the direct government of the constitutional administration at iia gota, a new order ol things has been in augurated which, although as yet some what experimental and a Hording scope for tho arbitrary exerelso of power by the delegates of tho national authority prom ises much improvement. .

A convention between the United States and certain other powers for the protec tion of submarine cabin was signed at Parts ou March 14, 1884, and has been duly ratified and proclaimed by this gov ernment, By agreement between the high contracting parties tills convention is to go into effect on the first of January next, but the legislation required for Its execution in the United States baa not yet bsen adopted, I earnestly recomrpend its enaotment. Casis have continued to occur in Ger many, giving rise to much correspondence In relation to tho privilege ol sojourn of our naturalised citlians of German origin revisiting the laud of their birth, yet 1 am happy to state that our relations with that country have lost none of their accustomed cordiality. The claims for interest upon the amonnt of tonnage dues illegally ex acted from certain German steam ship lines were favorably reported in lio'.h Houses of Congress at tl)e last session, and I trust will receive l)nai and favorable action at an early day. ( THE KiailKBV <JUEOTION, Tho recommendation contained in my last annual message in relation to a mode ol settlement ot tho fishery rights In the wateta ol British North America, so long a subject ot anxloua difference between the United States and Ureat Britain, was met by an adverse vote ol the Senate on April 13, laat, and thereupon negotiations were Instituted to obtain an aireetqeat with her llrlttanlo Majesty's govern ment for the promulgation of snch Joint interpretation and definition of the article of the convention of 1818, re lating to tho territorial waters and Inshore fisheries of the British provinces as should secure the Canadian rights from oncroich insnt by United States fishermen and at the same time insure the enjoyment by the latter of privileges guaranteed to lhamby such conventions. Tho quc^tlonqInvolved ?re of long standing, of grave conso ououee, nnu from time to time, for nearly three-f|uarters ol a century, have given rise to earneat International discussions not unaccompanied by Irritation, Temporary arrangements by treaties have served to allay friction, which, however, has revived as each treaty has terminated, The last agreement under the treaty ol 1871 was abrogated after dt|e notice by the United States, on June HO, ISM, but | was enabled to obtain lor our fliberiaen lor tho re, tnalnderot that sosson an enjiyment ol the lull privileges accorded by the termin ated treaty. The Joint high Commission, by whom the tresty had been negotiated, although Invested with plenary power to make a permanent settlement, wefo content with a temporary arrangement, alter the tsrinl nation ol wl'lob, the question WM r?l<" gated to the stlpulatioils ql the treaty ol 1818, aa to tho first article ol which no oonatructlon satisfactory to both conn trie* htu ever bsen agree 1 upon. The' progress ol clvlllsition and growth ol hopulaUou In the Urltten provinces, to Which (ho fisheries In question are con tiguous, and the ovpanslon ol commer cial Intercourse between them and the United States, present to-day a oondltlon ol affairs scarcely realised at the date ol the negotiations ol 1818. Naa and vail In tarsal! bar* bean brought Into ail* tence; modes of intercourse between the respective couutriea have been invented anil multiplied. The method* of conduct in# the tiaheriee have been wholly changed; and all this la necsasari ly entitled to caudid and careful consideration is the adjustment of the terina and condltiona ol Inter course and couimerco between the United Stateaand'tbeir neighbor* alonga frontier of over ?t.400 miles. This propinquity of community, of langnage and occupation, and aimilarity of political aud social insti tutions, indicate thepracticability and ob vious wisdom of maintaining mutual and friendly relations.

Whilst I am unfaiguodly doslrous that such relations should exist between us and the inhabitants of Urfut&da, yet tbe ac tion of their oiUolaia during the past Bau son towards our fishermen baa been aucli as to threaten their continuance.
