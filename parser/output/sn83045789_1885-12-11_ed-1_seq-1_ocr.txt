Take it Off! Senato. Wamhxotox, Dec. 10. After the rending of the journal Mr. Edmunds introduced a bill to proiide for tho establishment of a postal telegraph. Il was referred to the committee on postotSccs and post roads. Un introducing tho bill Mr. Kdmunds said it was the fame bill that was introduced at the last session of congress', which was sent to the committee on pustotlices and post roads and was reported upon by tho committee, so late that tbo suhji-ct could not bu considered by tho senate before tho expiration of the senate. Ho hoped tho committee would take the earliest opportunity to report on il and he added that differing from his former position on tbo subject ho would now ba willing to purchase at the actual valuo lb plants of any telegraphic company that may wish to sell to tho United Stales, tbo value to be appraised by aomu tribunal in tvhich they have confidence. Mr. Saulisbury said the committee on post offices and post roads bad at its last session, given tbo subject careful examination and reported upon tho bill as early as practi- THE BlLTEIt QUESTION.

CINQ AtXOXSO. A solemn requiem mas for repose of King Alfonso was celebrated in the St. Luko and St- Malhen's church. Six hundred invita tions wero issued to the president and cab inet, diplomatic corps and others. The auditorium of the church was draped in mourning. In front of tb altar rails stood the catafalque, on which was the state casket ot black, ornarmnlcd wilh filver mountings and dressed in black.the pillars of tho taber nacle being entwined with black bunting. President Cleveland and cabinet occupied seats in the front pews on the other side; back" ot these sal the diplomatic corps and a number of prominent people were present. 

HEALTH ASSOC1ATI0X. Mr. Edmunds disclaimed any reflection on the committee. Tho subject was a most important one and needed considerable exa mination, but now that the committee on post offices and post roads were in posses sion of all thu history of tho subject and tho broad facts involved, they would not have to go over thu whole ground again in detail. Mr. Edmunds expressed the desire that the subject should be brought to a vote as early as t6sible. Tho revolution offered by Mr. Morrill was agreed to, directing tho payment from tho contingent funds of tbo senate of the actual and necessary expenses of the senato committee appointed to attend tbo funeral of General Grant. The resolution ofTercd by Mr. Dolph was agreed to, calling on the secretary of war to Iransmit to the senate n copy ol the report of Captaiu llnhy, or tbo united States en gineer corps, relating to sea const fortifica tions in Europe m 18S1 and 1SS-. Mr. McPherson presented a joint resolu tion of the legislature of New Jersey, rec ommending congressional inquiry into the fitness of a portion of thu territory of Alaska tor the purpose of a penal colony for long-term or lite-term convicts. Iteferrcci to the committee on territories Mr. Dolph introduced a bill to repeal the law of last session, providing lor the set tlement ot claims of otficfrs and enlisted men of tbo army lor loss of privalo proper ty destroyed in the military service of the United States. Thi is the law to which the president calls attention in bis mestnge, a uidt finite in its terms, and as to which he -a)f, "If il h to remain on the statue booL.it nivd amendment-' In moving u reference of the bill to thu committee on military atfairs, Mr. Dolph cited the president's com ments and had the cleik read from thu re port of the sccivtary of war, the statements of that officer Mitt regard to thu law in qtitslion and the difficulty experienced in us interpri tation. From theso statements it arPHrt'd that one of tbo claim presented a. fur indemnity for loss of clothing of a family of six. another for furniture destroyed in the great tiro at Chicago and another for tho loss of two guld watebc. Mr. Dolph said be saw no reason w hy thn government should act as insurer of thu property of of ficers and soldiers in its army any more than of tbo property of the manv other classes of its ser ants and agents. Ho ob jected to tho law also upon the ground that t established no limit to the amount of property that should be paid for, and that it did not 'sufficiently define the character of articles that wero "to be covered by its pro visions. Mr. Cockrall saw no reason for any ditH culty for tbo interpretation of tho law. It asas specific in thu naturo of things as il could be. lie thougbnbere should Ik) mi chinery in tbc war department that would enable that department to decide what articles wcro "useful, necessary and proper" for an officer or soldier in tho line ot his duty, those being the only clashes of articles subject to claim under tho provis ions ot the act. Mr. Uawley was astonished that any per son capable of filling the position of secreta ry of war, should find any difficulty in con struing tho law in question. He thought it no reas inable objection to the act tbsl some foolish person had seen fit to suppose that under it be could get indemnity for "two gold watches.' The purposo of the act had been to relieve congress of a class of claim Smugglers Cleaned Out. Galveston, Dec 10. Tho News' Eigle Pass sp-cial sas: Sheriff Oglesbv. with Itobert Dawo and James Oliver, visited thu Del Gardo ranch last night with a warrant for the arrest oi Manuel Del Gardo on a charge of smuggling and horsestealing. Tbo ranch is twenty miles below Eagle Pass on tho Hio Grande, and has been famous for many years as a general rendezvous for horso thieves and outlaws from both re publics. A gang of Mexican smugglers and desperadoes made it their headquarters. Arriving at the houso tbo officers found Del Gardo asleep on tbo lower floor and wero about to siezo him when ho awoke and fired at Dawo, the bullet grazing his bead. Tho sberitT instantly fired, sending a bullet through Del Gardo's heart. The flreing aroused the gang who attacked tho officers and drove them from tho ranch. Obtaining reinforcements from this place tbo sheriff again attacked the ranch, at 6 o'clock this morning. Many shots were exchanged. Three Mexicans wero killed, tho rest escaped into Mexico carrying several wounded with them and taking about thirty horses, all of which are believed to be stolen. One of the smugglers was found on the premises. Dol Gardo had been a terror to the border and was reported very rich. It is thought that tho attack will result in breaking up tho wor.t gang of smugglers on tho border. Switchmen In Trouble. Chicago, Dec 10 The switchmen em ployed in tbo Chicago, Burlington and Quincy yards have struck. Tho night men quit work last night, and tho day men are expected to go out this morning. The trouble is a continuation of the misunder standing of some weeks ago. They went to work at 7' p. in., but were lrcquontly com pelled to quit work by tho engines being called in, which stopped switching, and they wero paid only for actual time put in. They demanded a full night's pay if they worked till midnight, and half night's pay if they reported at all. The company acced ed to the demand, but recently tho com pany had failed to keep the agreement, and. alter giving two days' notice, tho men struck last night. Thero is no change in tho situation of af fairs at the Burlington road to-day. No freight trains are moving and all tbo switcb mn are idle. The latter collected in the yards but have not resorted to violence of any kind. Whole Family Poisoned. Pittshcrq, Pa., Dec 10.j Some two weeks ago the family of Fredrick Hosmver, a well-to-do German of Tarrenturn, Pa., eighteen miles from this city, ate heartily of a salad, of which pork chopped fine was one of tbu principal ingredients. Last week the entire lamily, consisting of father and moth er, three sons and three daughters, wero sud denly seized with a terrible illness, and yes terday, Fiedrick, aged 20 ears, died in great agony. John, tbo second son, is now so low thai he is not expected to live through the night, and the rest are at the point of death. Before Fredrick's death tho physician became convinced that the disease was trichinosis. Ho secured a piece ot tho meat and with thu aid of a mi croscope found il altvo with tricbinas spi rales. Tho pork was purchased from a far mer and was taken frosn ono ot adrovoof hogs which he had raised himself on his own farm. Dr. McCulIough says bo ex pects another of the family "to die to-night and has no hopes that any of them will re cover. Rlel's Remains Transferred Wl.vstrEO, Dec 10. Kiel's remains were brought hero last night from Kigina in charge of two Catholic priests in a private car. The movement was secret. The car was run across tbc river to St. Boniface, where a number of half-breeds wero in wait ing, and placing it on a sleigh drove it to his mother's home at St. Vitals, where the family resided. When the box wis opened it was found the faceoas sligntly blackened and di-figured. The funrl will be held Saturday, when tho bodr will be brought to St. Boniface cathedral, where mass will be Troublesome Coal Miners, Pittsburg, Penn., Dec 10 Fine run was the scene ol another riot this morning be tween striking miner and men working for reduced wages. About half past three, when twenty-five miners were on their way to work, a squad of forty masked men met them and demanded that they return home This they refused to do and the mob made an attack upon them with clubs, sticks and stones. Tho riot lasted two hours. Ten of tho men were injured and Newton Campbell was beaten insensible. His injuries are be lieved to bo fatal. It- Hall and S. Miford are also seriously injured. The others got away with slight cuts and bruises. After standing their ground for nearly two hours the non-nnionists wcra driven off, and fled for places of safety. The strikers staid in the vicinity, and after day-brcrk twenty more miners came to work but tho mob made their appearance and they also fled. The mob then wedged the switch of tho pri valo coal road running to tbo mine, and then disappeared over tbo hills. The train coming along shortly after was thrown from the track and the engine upturned. No ono was hurt. Sheriff Gray with a posse, left for the scene of the mob. It is believed that the mob will visit all tbc mines to-day where men are working at a reduction and more trouble is anticipated. 1 here was no runner trouble at fine itun to-day, but another outbreak is looked for to-morrow morning. Sheriff Gray returned to this city this afternoon and reported ev erything quiet. Hois holding himself in readiness, however, and will start for the mines if there is any indication of another assault. Tho strikers are camped in the woods some distance from the mines, but will not allow any one to approach them. The people living in the vicinity are gener ally alarmed and anticipate a generaf raid along the river. Superintendent O'Niel, of tho Pine River mines, says he believes the mob will attack tbo mine again to-night and that an effort will bo made to burn tbo tip ples and ecgina house. The movement seems to be a thoroughly organized one, as secret meetings of strikers havu been held daily for over a week. It is beliovcd that the Altequippa mines will be tho next pointof attack, as suspicious looking men have been hanging around all day, and this evening fifty repeating rifles were expressed to tho Allequippa mines to bo distribute! among tbo non-union men. They will be supplied with fifty rounds of amunition and blood-shed is quite probable if the strikers attempt to disturb them on their way to and from the mines. It was learned to-night that the rioters paid a visit to Walton's mines.near Elizabeth, this morning, during tbo absence of the workmen, and destroyed their tools. They alo broke off tho end gates ot the coal wagons which wero stand ing on tho tipple loaded, and then dumped tho coal out. The Dead Rstlroad King Nrw York, Dec 10.

With morn ing came many messages of condolence and cards of friends, but everything was without undue bustle or contusion. On tho streets carriages and carts rattled by, their drivers oblivious of thn grief of the stricken family within, but on the sidewalks a majority of tho promenaders either stopped and gazed at the drawn curtains or walked slowly once or twice past the houe. The funeral ar rangements are not to ho changed. Private services are to bo held at the houe and after wards the funeral will Uko place from Bartholomew-church.

The Bundatrath has unanimously aDorored tho bill for the con. struction of the long spoken of ship canal oeiween ma uaiuc, me fclDe and the aortn sea. The canal will cost Germany about 155,000,003 marks. It is to be strongly for tified and will bavo a great military as well as commercial value. The defenses of the coast of Germany must always remain a di vided task so long as a canal does net unite the Baltic sea and the German ocean, and enable German war vessels to pass from one sea to the other by a route which does not expose them to the danger of falling into foreign hands. The project has been under the consideration of the Prussian govern ment more especially, since 18G5, and now at last, as it would seem, it is going to be real ized. Italy. 1'omc. Dec 10.
