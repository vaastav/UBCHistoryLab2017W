In these documents we mid the abridgement of the existing right ofsuf tragc and the denial to the people of all ri-ht to participate in the selection of public officers except the Legislative body advocated with hi oored arguments to prove that the 1 arsrc control 01 a government by the people is the- source of nil political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinteu at as a possible refuge from the power of the people. In my present position, 1 could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism. n is not nccdtul nor fitting here that general argument should be made in favor of popular ",,ou'uui out mere is one witn its connec tions not so hackneyed as most others to which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to place capital on an eaual footi ncr wit.ll. it" nnf tilinvn wiiacapicu, uiat no!)ody labors unless some- uouy else o owmmr ca nital someb OW bv tht nun of it, induces him to labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that, rnrot-.. al shall hire laborers and thus induce them to work by their own consent, or buy them and drive them to it without their consent. Ilavins proceeded so far it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers or what we call slaves, and further it i.i ae.-iumed that who ever is once a hired laborer is lixed in that con dition for life. Now there is no such kbor as as sumed, nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of n slave laborer. Both of these assumptions are false, and all inferences from chem arc irroundlosw. Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor and could nev er have existed n labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there ia tnd probably always will be a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. i lie error is m assuming that toe whole labor for n few men owning capital, and that a few avoid labor themselves and with their capital hire another few to labor for them, and a large majority belonging to another class neither work for others nor have others vJtk for thorn. In meet of the Southern States a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Nortii a largo majori ty are neiifier hirelings nor hired. Men with their families, wive, bons and daughters, work for themselves on their farms, in their houses and in their shops, taking the whole product lo themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one baud, nor of fared labor on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle- their own labor with capital that is, they labor with tneir own nanus, and alco buy or hire otheis to labor for them, but this Is OfiiV a mixed end not a distinct class. No principle stated is (fifiiurbed by the existence of this mixed class. Agulo, as had already been aid. there is not of necessity. ioy Bnch thin"; as tho free- hired laborer beiug fixed in that con dition for life. Many independent everywhere in these States a few years oack in their lives, wero hired laborers, lue prudent penniless beL'aar in the world labors for wages u while. saves a surplus to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account anotner wnne, and at length hires another new beginner to help him.

No men living are more worthy to bo trusted than those who toil up from poverty none less inclined to take or touch aught wlueti tliev have not honestly earned. Let them bewara of surrendering a political power which they al ready possess, ami which it surrendered win surely be used to close tne ooor oi auv.ti.co mctic amuust such as they, and to fix now diaa- bilities and burdens upon them till all of liber ty trhail be lost.

The President's mtwage was com; munieated soon after the opening of the Senate, ! TT through his private Secretary, Xiolay. i V Tle usual number of the message and accom- ! panying documents, wore ordered to bo printed. Mr. Grimes of Iowa introduced the follow- ing : Resolved, That tho thanks of Congress bs, and hereby are, tendered to Capt. Samuel F. Dupont, and through him to the officers, petty officers, seamen and marines attached to the squadron under his command, for their decisive and splendid victory achieved at Port Royal, on the 7th day of November last. Mr Grimes had no doubt every Senator was prepared to vote for the resolution now, but the best course to pursue was, perhaps, to act in accordance with precedent, and refer the reso lution to the Committee on Naval Affairs. The resolution was hid aside until the forma tion of tho Standing Committees Mr. Foster of Conn gave notice of his inten- tion to introduce a bill supplimentary to tho act to autuorize protection to be given to citi zens of the U. S. who may discover deposits of guano, approved Aug. 2Gth. On motion of Mr. Foster it was resolved that the Vica President appoint two members to fill the vacancies in the Smithsonian Institution, occasioned by the death of Senator Douglas, and the expulsion of James M. Mason, late Sen ator from Virginia. Adjourned. House. Mr. Mayuard of Tennessee, present ed the credentials of Mr. Clemens, representa ive elect from the 4th District of Tennessee. He briefly related the circumstances under which the election was held, saying that three mem bers were elected in East Tennessee, men who declare for the National Constitution, and for tlvj flag under which they had lived and und which they had hoped to die. lie spoke of the difficulty attending travel which prevents thnn from reaching Washing ton, to attend the Extra. Session. On motion, the credentials were referred to the Committee on Elections. The President's Message was received a few minutes alter noon and read. On motion of Mr. Washburn ol Illinois tho Message was re ferred to tho Committee of tho Whole on the State of tho Union, and his motion for printing 50,000 extra copies was referred to the Commit tee on Printing. Mr. Dunn of Indiana, offered tho follawing : Whereas, Henry C. Burnett, a member of this House froniKentncky, is in open rebellion ianist the Government of tho United States, therefore, licsolrcd, That tho said Henry C. linnctt oo and is hereby expelled from this House, and that the Governor of Kentucky be notified of bis expulsion. lUsolvcd, That tho surgoaiit-at-iirms oe di rected not to pay Burnett's salary which has accrued finco ihc close, of tho Extra Session.

Tho resolution asserted " in armed rebellion,'' but he heads a provision al Government in Kentucky, a Revolutionary Convention. Not satisfied with tho treatment of this Gov ernment to maintain the Union, nor satisaed with the course of his own State, he (Burnett) has assumed tho important duty ol organizing another Government, for tho better protection of the lives, property and liberties of the people of Kentucky. In this undertaking he lias employed ounon Buckncr, who is not only somewhat assimilated in name but in the deeds alio of another Simon, who once headed the Indians in Kentucky. Three times has tho gallant Statt declared by overwhelming majorities that efoe would not leave the United States to run after strango gods, or for tho eo'ealled Southern Republic. Notwitbrtafrdirri; her repeated declarations for the Union, they bad! hien told tho objocts of tho Convention and of tht so-called Southern Con federacy Wfiro to relic trtertt from a despotism, and to protect their rights, and that wo wero deceived. We were told by tho Executivo of tho so called Southern Confederacy that it was intend ed to respect tho condition of Ky., which it was pretended would not be done by tho Government of the United States. The Union men of Kentucky never ;did deny the right of the Federal Government to occupy its soil for tho exorcise of tho purposes implied by the Constitution. . .i i . i.i:...t:,xr.
