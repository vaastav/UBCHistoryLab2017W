ALEXANDRIA, VA. WEDNESDAY, DEC EM ii E R 4, 187 The Fkencii Si'OLiation Claims.?Sena tor Cameron stated yesterday that it is his de sigu to call up the French spoliations bill pend ing in the Senate at the close of the last session, at the first opportunity that he can get the floor for that purpose. Both he and Seuator Yiek ers had elaborate speeches prepared in favor of the measure last spring, but in consequence of the great press of business at that time, no oc casion was afforded to deliver them. When Mr. Cameron gets the bill up he will deliver his speech, and will be followed by Mr. Yiek ers, and Mr. Sumner will probably follow 31 r. Yiekers. The bill only appropriates five mil lion dollars, but it cannot pass without opposi tion, as some prominent members of both houses are known to be opposed to it. The ar guments of President Pierce, when he vetoed the bill passed during his administration, are understood to have been mainly derived from a speech in opposition to the bill delivered in the House of Representatives by Seuator Thurman, then a member of that body. The Electorial Yote.?The Washington correspondent of the Baltimore Sun of this morning says : '"Telegrams were received here last night,from leading democrats in New York and elsewhere, suggesting to democratic mem bers of Congress the propriety of holding a consultation fur the purpose of determining the advisability of recommending to the Greeley presidential electors some suitable action, per haps the casting of blauk votes. This sugges tion met with little favor. There was some in formal talk among democratic Seuators and members to day on the subject, and the al most general conclusion was the same as that arrived at by the national executive committee, that this was a subject which pertained exclu sively to the electors themselves. A promiuent Senator, however, remarked that he did not see the least impropriety in the electors casting their votes fjr Mr. Greeley, regardless of his decease. The Washington Chronicle says that * "there is a pretty general inquiry whether Gov. Blair, of Michigan, and General Farnsworth, of Illi nois, both holding chairmanships of important committees, will venture to follow the example ot General Banks, and submit the question of their eontiuuauce to a vote of the House. Some are of the opinion that they will have to do so; that it is demanded by un obvious personal sense of honor. Others, however, conclude that they will take shelter under the vote of the House already recorded in the case of General Banks, and insist that the principle has been thus settled. We predict that neith er of them will consent to occupy an equivocal position," The Democratic National Committee of New York held a meeting, on Monday, and an nounced, through their Chairman, Mr. Augus tus Schell, that they do not regard it as within the scope of their delegated authority to ad vise the electors of the States which favored the election of the Baltimore candidates as to the course they should pursue in view of the death of Horace Greeley. The situation is a novel one, and it is not deemed advisable to es tablish a precedent in a oase for which future National Conventions will probably provide. The Daricn expedition sailed from Norfolk, Monday, in the steamer Kansas. The instruc tions of the expedition comprise the completion of the work begun last year, of finding the best route from Lake Nicaragua to the Pacific, for which purpose three surveying parties will be sent into the field. After this work is accom plished, the Valley of the Sau Juan river will he explored, and the best route from I/ike Nicaragua to the Caribbean sea will bo laid down. The growth of Liverpool is something won derful, according to English journals. They declare that if the city continues to increase as a port at its present rate, it will soon be the largest in the world. Iu 17o7 the dock dues amounted to only ?330 las.; in J850, very nearly a century later they had reached ?242, US9 14s. 9d., and now, iu the year 1872, the great necessity is still for more accommoda tion. The Cincinnati Enquirer thinks that "the Electoral College machinery should be abolish ed aud the people vote directly through the several States for President and Vice President. Then, if the popular choice should happen to die before his inauguration, the office would fall where it constitutionally devolves?upon the Vice President, who is elected with a view to such a result." Senator Pool, of North Carolina, telegraphs to a Washington official that "we have defeat ed the Democratic Legislature" by electing Merrimon. He adds that it breaks up the power of the Democrats, and "brings a valu able and controlling element iu the State over to the administration." The vote stood 87 lor Merrimon and 80 for Vance. The Washington correspondent of the Ciu oinnnti Gazette states that the rules of etiquette in Washington are to be made muoh uiore formal and stringent and to be enforced with rigid severity; and that the great strife is to be "only in the folly displayed in the ladies' toil ets aud the seuseless court paid to high offi - cials." The Prince William correspondent of the Fredericksburg Star says that if the winter should prove a long one, there will be difficulty in getting stock safely through till spring, as the hay crop was unusually short.

Judge Samuel Nelson, whose resignation of a s-'at on the Hunch of the Supreme Court ol the U. S., was noticed in yesterday's Gazette, is upwards of eighty-eight years of age. He was appointed by President Tyler in 1 S4.0, hav ing previously been Circuit Judge, Judge of the Supreme Court, and Chief Justice of the State of New York. The President has ap pointed Ward Hunt, of New York, as his suc cessor. The nouiinatiou will he sent tu the Senate immediately. The Washington Republican says that the liudicals need a leader in the House, and thinks that that body committed a "great blunder on Monday when it declined to accept the resigna tion of Mr. Hmks as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee." This don't look like c.inciliation, Tiie Washington llepubiicau says:?"A good beginning in the bill business Was made in the House yesterday. More thau a dozen were in troduced. which it is safe to say will never come into the ll iu.-e again during the present Con g ress.'' We have received from Messrs. JO. J. Hale A: Sou, New York, No. 0, of the Cyclopedia of the best thoughts of Charles Dickens, which, like its predecessors, is excellent in selections and style. The Loudon Times, in alluding to that part of the President's message which treats of the civil war in Cuba, doubts whether the abolition of slavery would end the fued between the Cu bans and the .Spaniards. The Charlestown, Spirit of Jefferson says : ? "We understand that the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Company have recently taken steps to raise upon the mortgage bonds of their road $3,50' >, QUO.'' The L misville Courier-Journal thinks the best way for the Democrats to defeat Grant, if he should run for a third term, would be to nominate him themselves. The President and several members of the Cubiuet and Congress left Washington last night, for New York, to attend the funeral of Mr. Greeley, which took place to-day. In the Criminal Court of Baltimore, yester day, the trial of Jesse W. Uppereue for the murder of his aunt, Mrs. Amelia B. Wheat, was continued. Mr. Merrick, of Maryland, has been substi tuted for Mr.&Beck on the House committee, to inquire into the Credit Mobilier affair. "Active preparations" for the Inauguration continue to be made in Washington. Pieuty of time, gentlemen. George S. Kendall has been appointed route agent between Norfolk and Lynchburg, Va. vice W. N. Stevens resigned. Verdicts Againsttfie A. & F. 11. R. Co.? There have been suits pending in the Circuit Court of Alexandria for over a year, by various parties, against the Alexandria and Fredericks burg Railway Company, aggregating about $20,UUO. These suits were mainly in the in terest of the Engineer Corps that had survey ed and located the road, during the period that the road and its franchises were under the control of Stewart <fc Co. The charter and its franchises were purchased uearly two years ago by what was understood as a branch of the Pennsylvania Central. This company has re sisted the payment of the claims against the original company, which came down as alagacy to the late purchasers. List Spring some two or three of these eases were tried in Alexandria before the Cir cuit Court, and verdicts rcudercd against the present Alexandria and Fredericksburg Com pany. It was supposed that these verdicts would have been accepted by the Railway Company as a judgment in regard to all simi lar claims. But they were not, and the case was reopeued at the pre>eut (fall) term of the Court, aud a number of young men obtained verdicts in their iiivor. On Saturday last the ease of Charles B. Morse vs. Alexandria and Fredericksburg Rail way company was taken up, and after argu ment, submitted to a jury, who returned a ver dict for plaintiff, aud judgment against defen dant for $1,991.70 with interest from Septem ber 1st, 1871, till paid, and costs. Similar judgments were awarded against the same rail road company in many other cases. The Company has itself well hedged in, hav ing we believe built the stretch over which so much palaver has been had, under a mortgage, so that we really do not know whether practi cally, the creditors are any nearer getting their money than they were before tlm judgments were reudered.?Fredir'tcksburg Ancs. PaudONEI).?The President has directed that a pardon be issued to Richard N. Bower man, recently an official of the Baltimore Cus tom House, who was sentenced October 27, 1871, to four years iinprisoment and to pay a Hue of $2,340.72, he having been convicted lor the embezzlement of Government funds. A pardon has also bccu issued in the ease of Dr. Thomas N. Lewis, of West Virginia, who was convicted in September, 1S72, of remov ing spirits with tax uupaid from a distillery of which he was part owner, and was sentenced to imprisonment aud to pay a fine of $200. In the case of Samuel and John Rogers, of Tennessee, convicted of removing and having iu possession a quantity of tobocco, on which the tax bad not been paid, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment and to pay a fioe of $2,500 each, the fine has been remitted.

Telegrams, dated Melbourne, Australia, yes terday, say that a conflagration in Auckland, New Zealand, has destroyed 1 uildimrs and other property to the value of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Mr. Lucicti llawley has been appointed Su pervisor of Internal Revenue for New York vice Dutcher, resigned. Mr. liawiey was the Reve nue Agent under Mr. Dutehcr, and his appoint ment is in accordance with the Civil Service policy. The ease of Tweed was called in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, New York, yesterday, when his counsel read a long affidavit to show that the indictments were improperly found against him, and delivered a long argument in favor of quashing them. The tombs of Gtii. Cavaignac and M. Han din, in Montmartre Cemetery, were decorated on Monday in the presence of three thousand people. The demonstration was quietly con ducted, and there wa< no inti rferetiee on the part of the police. The legitimate branch of the Alabama Leg islature, owing to the death of oue of its mem bers and the ab.-euee ot another, was without a quorum yesterday. The Radical branch,which holds its sessions in the L'nitcd States Court House, re elected George 10 Spencer to the United States Senate by a unanimous vote. The women Wood hull and Ciaflin yesterday gave bail in $s.nnO each in the civil and crimi nal suit in the I niied States Commissioner's Court, Now York, a Mr. Jourdan, of Yirgiuia, and J. M. Kinley furnishing the bail. Tn the case of Challis, for libel, they gave bail in the police court in $2,000 each, and in another civil suit in $5,u0u each. The French Assembly, it is believed, will divide into two great parties, the Left and Right, for the election of the Committee of Thirty as proposed by M. Dufaurc's resolution. The Rcpublique Francai.sc says that in the event of a defeat on organization of the com mittee, it is possible that President Thiers and his supporters on the Left will withdraw from the Assembly. A report comes from Oregon by way of Sao Francisco, to the cff'ect that all tho settlers on Sink river have been massacred by the Modoc Indians, and that a .squad of thirtyfive I nited .States soldiers from Fort Klaneld is all the available force that can be mustered to t eighty warriors. .Militia companies are said to be organizing in the Northern part of the State. William Muffitt Graham, President of the Walkill National Bank of Middletown, N. J., was held in $20,000 bail yesterday by Commis sioner Osborne to answer the charge of having jointly, with Charles II. Hirton, Cashier, de frauded the bank by means, of false entries, of some $100,000. llorton, it is alleged, has ab sconded, and Graham claims to have been igno rant of his peculations. The New York Evening Post pretends to have discovered a conspiracy between certain Republicans and the late members of the Now York King, by which all reform legislation is to be defeated. The plan contemplates the resignation of the officers appointed by the Mayor, to the end that .Mayor liall may fill their places with Republicans of "easy virtue" before Mr. Haveuieyer is inducted into office. The whole thing is doubtless a fabrication. Reports to the Internal Revenue office show that the number of grain and molasses distil leries operating on the 1st instant was two hun dred and thirty-six, with a daily producing ca pacity of two hundred and sixty-two thousand three hundred and forty-three gallons. The number of such institutions in operation on the first of November was two hundred and six, with a daily capacity of two hundred and twen ty-eight thousand four hundred and ninety gallons. It appear fsrom the official statement of the Court of Claims that during-the year ending December 1st one hundred and twenty cases were decided, seventy of which were on ac count of proceeds of cotton captured by United States military forces. The aggregate amount claimed for the cotton was ?2,270,000, and the award of theCourt in these cases was$ 1,41.'>,000. The highest award was$47-l,O00,or ?100,000 less than was claimed. The Court allowed $-11,000 for proceeds ofsale of sixty-nine thousand Bank of Louisiana notes, being the amount of the claimant's deposit with that bank at the date of the seizure of the same, under order of General Banks, August, 1SG3. Mysteriot'.s Disapvkances r.\ Nkw York. ?The Now York World gives a list of the names of fifty persons who have mysteriously disappeared in that city since August last. What a list! What sin and misery would we have unfolded to view had we the history and fate of each protraj'ed. The list embraces from the tender age of twelve to the veteran of sixty. Some of them have absconded? some been knidnapped? some have stepped from the paths of virtue and honor into the by ways of sin and shame. The World calculates that probably four-fifth* of the list may be ac counted for on the score of voluntary .or com pulsory absenteeism, but there still remains ten or a dozen lives which have been suuft'od out most mysteriously, aud whose manner of passing away is jealously guarded as a dread secret by the river and the streets. The de scriptions of the missing parties are sa lly inter esting. We give the captions of a few?Lost with $1,100 in Gold?Left her Home in .Moo roe Street?Decoyed from Home?Last Seen in a. Bank?A Boy of Twelve Missing?(there are half a dozen of such)?Lost While in Search of Employment?Disappeared from the Platform of a Car?A Girl of Fourteen? An Oid Woman Missing?Baggage still at Cas tle Garden, &e., &c. The Police proper and the aid of Detectives were invoked in probably almost every case of mysterious disappearance, aud in some instances lavish sums of money ex pended, but all in vain. The veil over those lives ha* nor boon and probably never will be lifted. * E^<,3\I V

Loiter from Chicago. | Correspondence of the Alexandria (iazette. | CnicAOu, Dee. 1, I>72.--Your correspon dent arrived here on Saturday morning at seven o'clock, having taken the s:5 p. tu. train iron Baltimore via the "Pennsylvania Central." Though this is tiot the f<ist lim: over the North ern Central, yet, as there is but one change, that at Pittsburg, it seems to me to be the best, most pleasant, and 'tis said, the safest. There is one other important advantage; to this train i.- attached an elegant Pullman sleep ing car, while to the 10:25 train there is none, and there are with the last named two changes, one at Ilarrisburg, the other at Pitt.-burg?the one at Ilarrisburg about midnight, aud as it was then snowing I did not regret having made the selection, though I missed the beautiful iCcuery afforded by day travel over the moun tains in Pennsylvania. I mention those facts for the banefit of your readers whose business it is to travel in this direction. I have not been here long enough, nor seen so much of the city, as will euable me to form au opinion of its greatness, its wealth and elegant buildings, though I am free to confess I aui disappointed in my expectation?, This arises, in part, be cause Lam domiciled on the burnt district, piled up in many places with the debris of the late lire, but larger piles still of building ma terial, being used in replacing the destroyed houses, excavated sidewalks, made passable with temporary timber footways, rendering street crossing necessary, frequently, to get along. This indicates that the entire district is not actually rebuilt; many lots are still vacant, a number of buildings incomplete, yet a vast number are, if not entirely finished, occupied. These buildings arc simply grand, grand be yond all conception, and for the purpose intend ed, extravagantly grand. The prices of proper ty, to my sober senses, seem fictitious; the cost of buildings and rents paid are too high, and partake too much of the marvelous to bear repeating. What would a first class Alexan dria merchant think of a $75,000 per annum rent. Even this amount is paid here in some instances. Woe be to such should a financial crisis come! The Page building on Wabash Avenue and Washington street, costing $2:J0,000 is to be occupied by D. B. Fisk & Co., wholesale deal ers in niillinary and fancy goods. 'J he dear iadies arc able to wear, and perhaps their hus bands to buy, at prices comparing with the rent and co.-t of building. I might name others, but euough for an idea. It seems to be con-^ ceded on all hands that the valuable part of the city is tending south and west, property outside of the city limits, south, btunir looked to by speculators as affording the best field for their operations, while property withiu the city is somewhat depressed by some fire oidi nance or tax which I am at present unable to explain. The snow met meat II trrisburg, though not heavy. It is cold here?the ice quite thick. Snow began to fall last uight and is stilt falling Q ? The Gold Mines in Yiiuiinia.?That most I of the mines in the State will pay handsomely for the investment, if they are properly man aged, there can be no doubt, it the recently patented machine for extracting the gold from the ore proves a success, or even half that is claimed for it by the patentee. ,. I have been for many years interested m the different mines located in the State, and every one of them was abandoned on account only of the gold, after going down sixty feet, being imbedded in pyrites, and the proper process of desulphurizing the same had not been found. The mines are more easily worked than any others; the veins are more regular, and there is an abundance ol gold in both the ore and -late. The Valid use mines, especially, situa ted near Fredericksburg, have always been pro ductive. The large quantity of saud lying there on the surface, if treated properly, would amply repay the expense of the labor and time used in its development. The mines in Louisa coun ty, also, cau be recommended to capitalists as being well worthy their attention. I have always been satisfied that the \ ir ginia tzold fields would eventually pay, and that it was merelv from a want of capital, as well as alack of judgmeut. that they had not been made productive long ago. Gold mining has heretofore been carried on as a speculative business, and by no means worked scientifically. If "capitalists will direct their attention to this fact, aud see that in future their mines are worked iu a legitimate manner, and opened ami developed properly, there is no doubt but that they can bo made to pay well.?Pittxhury Cuurnr. H ai in *a \. S kn ATi Mil Ah ( 'a i 'i rs.?The caucus of radical Senators. called i*?r the purpose of overhauling the committees; was held yesterday in lhe reception room of the Senate. No iu vitation was extended to the liberal republican Senators to participate in the proceedings and none of them, of course, wjre present. The caucus la-ted about an hour, and was presided over by Mr. Anthony. Ic is understood that a stern determination was expressed by the ma jority of those present to place the liberal Sena tor.- on exactly the same footing as democrats, to be treated in all respects precisely in the same manner. Two or three including, it is said Mr. Wilson rather favored holding out to them the haud of forgiveness, but this would not be listened to by others, who said that if they came back at all, they must take back seats and be put on a long probation. A committee to revise the list of landing committees was appointed consisting of Messrs. Frelinghuysen, Morrill of Maine, lvmsey, Lewis and Stewart. This committee will report to the adjourned caucus to be held to morrow, and it is perhaps needless to repeat that every liberal who is now chairman of a committee will be deposed.?Bait. /Sun.
