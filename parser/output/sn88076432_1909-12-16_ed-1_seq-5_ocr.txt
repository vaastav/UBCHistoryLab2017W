GUISSING AT A TARIFf "Tlit! truu principle of protection." says the republican platform, "is best maintained by the imposition of such duties as will ci|ual tho difference be tween cost of production at homo aud abroad." That has loiitf been the cardinal theory of protection. 80 it would seem that, in framing a tariff bill 011 true protective principles, the first step would bo to ascertain the difference between cost of production at home and abroad. No such stop has ever yet been taken. All the tariir bills have been based sub stantially upon tho esparto testimony of interested persons. Kven after it was well -ttled that a new bill would be framed in HKl'.t, the protectionist party in congress refused to authorize a scien tific: investigation of tho facts in tho case. Even now tho country i.s without authoritative information as to the relation between a given duty and the difference in cost of production at home and abroad. It may have Mr. Gary's statement on one side aud Mr Carne gie's on lie other, or a glove manu facturer's allegations and the contra dictory allegations of a glove importer but there is no impartial, determinative finding to which it can turn. A NEW VARIETY 01 WHEAT. A now grain for feeding purposes and an improved alfalfa that will add £20!V UjU.uui'to Uncle Sam's crop values will be submitted at the meeting of the American Association for the Advance ment of Science, in Huston, by Prof. li. (J. nudum, for fifteen \eai head of the agricultural department of the Univer sity at Wyoming, who left Chicago to exhibit tho finished results of a series of experiments in grasses and grains secured at the experimental farm undor his supervision at Worland, Wyo. The feeding grain is a new variety of einmer, a hybnd wheat, which is superior to '•orn in bene nourishment and flesh-pro ducing power, and yields from SO to loO oushels per acre, or about double the best Russian speltz. It is a beardless wheat of large size and fixed hull, especially litted to production in the arid, semi-arid or irrigated country west of the 100 Meridian, including all the elevated plateau of tho Rocky Moun tains and the valleys of the mountain ranges. This region, from tho Gulf of Mexico, to tbe Canadian boundary has an average elevation too great for the maturina of corn. Stock raising of all kinds is still the dominant interest throughout the whole of it, and the dis covery of this new feed-grain promises relievo the stockmen from the cost and trouble of importing corn from the middle western states for use in fatten ing or finishing the animals for market. This will mean an almost incalculable economy in all branches of animal hus bandry, and a corresponding increase in profits. As supplementing it, Professor Buffum has succeeded in producing a new variety of alfalfa, possessing the quality of the best known alfalfas as a balanced ration, but having an increas ed rapidity and weight of growth that will give a ield of one to two and a half tons an acre. I'his new alfalfa has reached a height of nine feet in a single season, and will easily enable four cut tings a year, instead of the present practice of three. Alfalfa has a mini mum ton value of around five dollars and there are millions of acres of it in the part of the west described, so that the additional of only one ton per acre, if this new variety were exclusively grown, would mean live times as mar.y millions of dollars as there are acres, earned by the farmers every year. Cavaliercounty i- now able to justly claim a position ranking in the fore front among the corn growing counties of North Dakota. Statistics furnished at the recent meeting of the national educational association show that seventy-six per cent of the teachers of the Unitad States are woman. Canada, too, has the battleship craze and is preparing to build a big navy. Why Canada should want a big nayy is not clear. Her territory is protected, not only by Great Britain, but by the United States under the Monroe doctrine. It is noticed that Hon. Fred McLean, of Langdon, who not so many moon since accepted an editorial position on the hybrid Fargo News, with tho old time democratic war cry, is now suing the News company- presumably for un paid salary. The publication in (juestion will never be successful financially nor well edited until it succeeds in draining Torn Marshall's barrel and socures the editorial services of Packard of Valley City. As to "Kush, be is on his home bane, and all ba will have to do to win out will be to rtmurrect bin old-time jack rabbit ranch,—BradocW New*. Taft sent his message to Congress this week. It is a mighty weak document— not much like tho positive demands and statements to which tho country was treated by his predecessor. It is announced in Washington that 110 postal savings bank bill i.s likely to go through at this session. Broken promises seem likely to become a familiar feature of the present ad ministration. Judge Kneeshaw is mentioned iu the Saturday evening iasue of the Grand Forks Times as a possible candidate for the republican nomination at the June primaries of next year for a judgeship on the state supreme bench. Upon the subject of tariff President Taft in his message to congress points out that he wants the light of technical knowledge shed upon the schedules before further revision is undertaken and he believes that the now commission may be relied upon for that purpose. Tinkering with the tariff is not desired in a hastv manner. There will be no further speculation as to the senatorial aspirations of Mar shall and Gronna. Formal announce ments were issued by them last, week Mr. Marshall comes out as a senatorial candidate to succeed Senator MeCumbor and what Congressman Gronna is after is Thompson's toga. Things should gradually begin to warm up in the republican camp. The students at the agricultural college are going after the statue of Ex President Roosevelt promised to the stato of North Dakota. The statue, to be made by the celebrated sculptor Gustav Vigeland, will be of heroic size, and will represent the former president 111 cowboy garb, seated in an easy at titude on asuporb horse. The students of the agricultural college feel that it is appropriate that this slatuto should be erected on the campus of the farm school and to that end have organized to raise a fund sufficient to assure its erection at the agricultural college, Across the international boundary to the north the Grain Growers' Associ ation, an organization of tho farmers, has marketed this season ono-i|uarfer of tho grain crop. In doing this the farmers have saved all the prolit of the middlemen, and under their agreement with the association, this profit will be devoted to the betterment of their homes and the improvement of the agricultural world in general. Perhaps the day will coma in this country when the farmers will not only be able to sell their grain without the intervention of middlemen, but will be able to have something to say about what they are to receive for it. The revelations of the sugar trust robbery of the treasury is a severe shock to tho admirers of President Roosevelt's administration. The actual state of the conditions was laid before Mr. Roosevelt and why he, who was always wielding the ''big stick," made no effort to correct the gross swindles, made is inexplicable. Probably the temperamental makeup of the man had something to do with his inaction. Whatever the cause it remains a big blot on the Roosevelt administration. It has been proved in court and confessed by restitution of ?2.()00,CH')0 that the sugar trust has systematically defraud ed tho revenue. It is conservatively estimated that tho sugar trust has cheated the government out of 82o,00U, (iOO to .?.'](),000,000. Iron apparently enters the soul of the Hannah Moon when it notes the grow ing popularity of the columns this paper devotes to "Around tbe County." The attitude of the Moon in its "keep of! the grass" item of last week a» a method of interference to the 

DKMOCKAT man gath ering items for this paper's county news column is a pretty poor sen re. Better get the news columns of tho .Moon copy righted F.ditor Boyd, as otherwise the common usages of newspaperdom will hardly back up what you insinuate we are guilty of. Since tho Man in the Moon has not as many moons since acquired the rights of citizenship in these free United States his ideas may in the courso of time broaden and expand along jour nalistic lines and otherwise. This paper doe not deign to be dictated to by the Moon as to its method of conducting the paper and therefore ignors the presumed egotistical attitude of that paper. Better go and cultivate a nose for news Brother Boyd. If you could develop your second animal sense perhaps tbe readers of the Moon might derive a benefit from the effort.

THURS I A I DECEMBER 16. 1990 School NOTES Tho Political Economy students have been dealing in the "transfer of goods" in private economics. They are interest ed in the latest silver legislation having studied the Sherman and Bland acts. They have enlisted their sympathy with international bimekalism. The German II class have reached the crisis of Der NelTe als Onkle and have become most interested in the action of the incorrigible rogue Cham pagne. The book will be completed before the Christmas holidays. Tho English III class are still review ing. The Anglo Saxon writers have been dealt with. Bede was the first prose writer. He lived in the eighth century, in a monastery in northern England all his life and wrote Latin grammers and treatises. How to tind the exact center of a circular flower-bed was a problem which seemed hard to the geometry students 011 account of its simplicety. Take three points at the edge of the bed, not in a straight line, connect them with straight lines and then draw from the center of each straight line a per pendicular. The point where the three perpendiculars intersect is the center of the circle. The chemistry class learned how ice was manufactured. It is evolved from the curious phenomenon that ammonia in becoming a gas absorbs heat. The exact method of making ice is as follows: Liquified ammonia is forced from a tank into a series of pipes which are sub merged in an immense vat tilled with with brine. Large galvanized iron cans containing pure water to be frozen are immersed in the brine, which i.s kept below the freezing point of water by tho rapid evaporation of ammonia in the pipes. In about sixty hours the water in the cans changed into cakes of u-e weighing about .'}00 pounds. As fast as the ammonia gas forms in tho pipes, it is removed by exhaust pumps into another tank, where it is recondensod to liquified ammonia and conducted as needed into the first tank to bo used again. The ammonia is thus used over and over again without appreciable loss. Tho class manufactured ammonia by heating ammonium chloride with slaked lime. ItcameofTin a colorless light gas and having a suffocating odor. That which was allowed to escape into the room caused much coughing. By dissolving this gas into water the students mado ammonium hydroxide, that which is sold in the stores under the name of ammonia. LANGDOM'S NEW INDUSTRY The Northern Manufacturing Com pany Incorporated by Lang don Capitalists. A new Langdon industry is the North ern Manufacturing Co., incorporated during the past week for the manu facture of the Perfection"Wild Oat Separator, an invention patented re cently by Joseph F. O'Connor and George W. Mogan, who since securing a patent for their invention have re moved from Easby to Langdon and started to make their Perfection Oat Separator in a factory installed [in [the Opera Ifouso block. The worth of the invention has been carefully investigat ed by many of the leading fanners of Langdon and vicinity since a model of the machine was first exhibited here by Mr. O'Connor last summer, Messrs O'Connor and Mogan have associated with them in the organization of the Northern Manufacturing Co, two Langdon men. M. Sullivan and 13. Keating, who are contident that the now invention is able to thoroughly solve toe problem of how farmers in Cavalier county can eradicate the growing evil of wild oats on their farms. The factory in the Opera 1 louse block is fitted up with steam fixtures and machinery and enough orders are now ahead to keep the inventors and several men busy until spring. Mr. O'Connor, tho man ager, asks that farmers come in and see his wild oat separator when in town and suggests that they bring with them a half-bushel of grain so that he can practically demonstrate what his new invention will do. LANGDON'S GENEROUS GIFT Church Goers Donate Thankoffering to Fargo Childrens Home. The letter which appears below was received during the week by Rev. F. J.

Eberhart said that as soon as he re turns from the meeting of the regents at the state university he will begin an investigation of the strike condi tions to learn what the real situation is. If he finds that freight traffic gen erally is tied up and that the public is suffering to any great extent he will at once make overtures to both the switchmen and the railroads and see if there is not some way in which they can arbitrate the points in contro versy and end the strike. On the other hand, if it is true, as the railroads claim, that most of the freight is being moved, that tho strike is practically broken and that the pub- FRANK T. HAWLEY. lie is not suffering materially, he does not believe that anything can or will be done. In that case it would be only natural that the railroads would re fuse to arbitrate, in view of the fact that they offered to arbitrate under the Erdman act and the switchmen re fused to do so. President Frank T. Hawley of the Switchmen's Union of North America said that there will be developments in a few days which will have an im portant bearing on the strike situa tion in the Northwest. He would not divulge their nature, but they hang on some understanding which Mr. Haw ley had with President Samuel Gom pers of the American Federation of Labor at Cincinnati last week. uranue is tlie lowest rock in the earth's crust.
