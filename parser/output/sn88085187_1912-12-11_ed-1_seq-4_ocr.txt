THE SUBLIME JOY OF GIVING Close and intimate contact with the sudden display of a basic human emo tion has its splendid compensations. Under the veneer of selfishness which has become habitual with human beings in the struggle for the survival of the fittest, the unquenchable Are of human sympathy and compassion smol ders; ready to leap into flame when the right chord is touched. The Times printed a very ordinary unvarnished story of the plight of John Leasing and his family. A thoughtless law would not allow the county authorities to give food and shelter to this family of Jive because its members had lived in the county for less than six months* But Times readers did not stop to quibble; they did not ask for "references, " nor did they inquire wheher the Leanings were "deserving" or otherwise. It was enough that these five human beings, three of them little children, were cold and hungry and in (lire need. And it was working men and women who were first to hurry forward with succor. Jt is vastly encouraging to newspaper writers to lose sight of the crime and graft and evil of the world, even for a day, and gain this insight into the inner workings of the hearts of plain people—men and women who really care whether a fellownian is hungry or not! WHY, GEORGE! Reading President Taft's message and then Secretary of Navy George yon L. .Meyer's report one sort of suspects that George took advantage of the closing hours to punch Bill below the belt. Cousin Hill reported everything lovely with our foreign diplomats, who had helped to preserve our foreign peace and boosted our foreign trade amaz ingly, and who only needed better pay and better housings, and he showed, most pathetically, how he had thrown his very soul into the peace arbitration crusade. And now conies George with the solemn declaration that treaties are not worth the paper they're written on and that we ought to have about 22 more Hrst-class battleships. Congress might have been badly rattled, had it got these two irreconcil able opinions in a bunch. THE 

PASSING OF THE TREE Are Christmas trees going out of fashion in Tncoma? Ten years ago nearly every window displayed a tall, mysterious form swathed in a winding sheet. On the mystic "night before" the sheet was whisked off, Daddy came in to light the candles, but not a soul dared touch those delightfully strange shaped packages that hung from green branches or were grouped'in happy disarray around the bottom of the tree, lint the demand for Christmas trees in the public market was so "slow" last year that the merchants are not in clined to try to sell trees this year. What a pity! We are becoming civilized so rapidly that very soon our Children will tell us with a fine scorn "There ain't no Santy Clans'!" "What," asks Georgie Creter, 4th grade, "is meant by the Rule of Three?" Ask your teacher, Georgie. We think it means wife, mother-in-law and baby, but will admit that we hain't Baw a rithmetio or grammir in 25 year. While in the 4th graid, we devoted our self to being learned spellin. Wicker sham reports: "Experience at enforcing criminal liability under the Sherman law is not encouraging." We're gettiuer discouraged about it, too, George. With our secretary of navy yelling for two dozen more battleships and Canada going to build three for the British navy, we may expect a large and active nightmare in Brother Car negie's peace dreams. Certainly it's all right for Gov. Hodges to give some of the Kansas election spoils to women. It's almost as good as civil service reform, for com ing governon will hesitate before kinking a lady out of her office.

The otner day on the groat campus of Cornell university 3, --000 men and boys stood for an hour bareheaded in pouring rain to do honor to "the grand old man of America"—Andrew V. White, just eighty yoars "young." White's career may be said to have begun with his organizing of Cornell college 'way bade in the early 'Go's. For a long time White had cherished an ideal of a new sort of college—"a place," as he put it, "where any person oould find instruction in any subject." It was an innovation, for women were not to be exclud- Ed, nor wore any subjects to be tabooed. The formal spirit that prevailed In eastern collegiate circles was to be altogether lacking in this bistory-niaking institution on the shores of Cayuga lake. Ezra Cornell listened to White's educational ideals and furinslie.d tho funds. The char ter was granted and Cornell opened. From the very first the ability of White was evident. About him was gathered the most bril liant array of teachers. There was the great scientist, Louis Akhkslz; there was the poet, Hay nard Taylor, as well aa Goldwln Simth and James Russell Lowell. When he had the new college in excellent running order White was appointed to many national and international committees, serving brilliantly. In 1879 he was made minister to Berlin, holding the post two years. On President Cleveland's ac cession he was appointed to the Important Venezuelan commie- Kion and then again given the ambassadorship to Germany. And now at eighty this great mind Is as ctaar as ever and White is taking up a new study, the theory of criminology! He says he has already collected a great deal of data on the sub ject and in a few years—surely before ho is ninety—will have some important contributions to make to this science!
