We publish elsewhere in to day's paper a complete summary of President Roosevelt's message to Congress this week, the' pe ru>al of which our readers will find much more satisfactory than wading through the voluminous decussent itself ooo?i*o unu.-ually lengthy, containing over twenty-five thousand words, and its reading in Congress consumed two and one-half hours. The paper is characteristic of Roosevelt?able, scholarly and interesting. However much one may differ with the President in the views and opinions expressed by him, the conclusion is irresistible that he handles his subjects with consummate skill and ability, to say nothing ol the relreshing degree ot candor that pervades his writings. Ot the various matters consid ered by the President probably what he says about lynching will prove ot greatest interest to the South just now, since the subject necessarily includes a very important feature ol the negro problem. W.1 ile deprecating the prevalence ol mob violence, the President admits thai lynching is not peculiar to any particular section?that it occurs "now in one part ol the country, now in another." As to the cause of lynching ho truly says: "A great many white men lynched, but the crime is Jiariy Irequent in respect to .men. Tiie greatest exist *e ol lynching is the perespecially by black *,he hideous crime of imost abominable in gory of crimes, even . murder." nouncing the cruel _. i ^ jus niHiuier in wnicn of fhe mob are some. tured. the President Mie tendency ol lynchrape as follows : ness grows by what ^on; and when mobs lynch lor rape they ' extend the sphere ol operations and lynch lor V. /nany other kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds ol the lynchings are not for rape at all; while a considerable proportion of the individuals lynched are innocent of all crime.'' The President's idea as to the duty of the negro in the mat1 ot suppressing rape and as how the crime should be punii cu JO 

UA|'IC33CU UJ u 1 ill ao I lows: "Every colored man shou realize that tiie worst iy his race is the negro niu ! and. above all the neg. ait who commits the dreadiul cm ol rape ; and it sliould^be felt in the highest degree an oiler against the whole country, a against the colored race in p ticular, for a colored man to f to help the officers of the law hunting down with a'1 pcssil earnestness and zeal every sn infamous offender. Moreover, my judgment, ihe crime of ra should always be punished wi death, as is the case with murd assault with intent to comn tape should be made a capi crime, at least in the discreti ? f the court; and provisi should be made by which t punishment mav follow imn diately upon the heels of i offense; while the trial should so conducted that the vict need not he wantonly shan: while giving testimony, n that the loast possible public diall he given to the details.' That is certainly good adv to the colored man, and it is he hoped that ho will heed The President is also right ab( the punishment of the rapi The penalty should not only death, but it should "follow i mediately upon the heels ol I offense."

God in I infinite wisdom on November 1906, sent His messenger ii the home of Mr. 1, T. Hunt i i and claimed the sweet spirit I his dear wife, Mrs. Ella Hun who for many years has been I encouraging and consolingldo this good man, as well as central lightol this highly cult ed christian home. It is difficult to estimate 1 intluence of such a lite us he though dead, yet she speaks, t will speak until the end ot tii When the end came she mel like a christian soldier, with g? ; hope in Christ. And we know beyond this v of teal's there is a life abo where all sorrow shall cease, f we shall res' in love. She will he greatly miss in i lie church, town, and comn nity, but we bow in humble s mission to the will of Him \> doeth all tilings well. Iler living would be the gri tying and consoling ot husbai children, relatives and Irien but to die is her eternal gain. When we stand by, and such a precious jewel as this tal from our midst, we can only | claim as l'aul|did : O dea | where is thy sting? 0 gra wnere is my victory r nut thai bo to God, the victory is us through our Lord Je Christ. In my fancy, 1 can hear lonely daughter say, ; O mother, mother1'dear, Mow can I live without thee here? But in a gentle tone of love, I h mother say, Grieve not my child, chase all fears away.
