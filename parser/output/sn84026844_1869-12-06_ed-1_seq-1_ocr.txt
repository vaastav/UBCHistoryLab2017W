The Comptroller says the legal prohibition to banka to hire deposit Is not aufllolently explicit or positive to prevent It, snd hints at legislation to that end. The Comptroller argues In favor of the National Banking syatem as the oanae of eaae In the money market, and lower rates of Interest than would otherwise be obtained. He thinks Government circulation which Is not oonverttble, and therefore, not elaatio. should be withdrawn and substituted, by national bank notes whlob ate nominally redeemable and oertalnly amenable to the laws of trade. No check to limitation should be imposed on the latter other than the law of supply and demand. A self adjusting system of currency Is the only oue that Is adapted to the exigencies of trade and to the wanta of tbe country, and It Is a vital question at this time whether this result can be reached before the return of specie payments, if possible, at all. It Is only through the agency uf national banks that the machinery of the government Is not adapted lo such ends and further, if possible. It its so only npon the Hdoptlon of a policy which will tend gradually, but surely, to the resumption of specie payments. I must be a gradual development ofaprocesswhlob shall absorb tho legal tenders and put In their place a paper ourrenoy which shall at all tlmea and under all circumstances be exchangeable for coin, either of paper legal tenders or of gold; a paper ourrenoy which abalL gradually in* urease, while the legal'teuders for lta re jemptlon shall gradually decrease la luch ratio as a healthy demand for banking, facilities may determine. While free banking may thus be established with safety anterior to specie payments conditioned only on the withdrawal or cancellation of a legal lender doll&r for every dollar of bank jurroncy Issued. Free banking npon a jpecle basis may also be permitted with ;qnal safety a^d without delay, with letalls of property adjusted. Banks nay be established with authority to asoe and pot in circulation gold notes, limiting the amount only to the ability >f the hanku to comply with the necessa* y conditions, aud redeem their issues jy the establishment or banks on a spelie basis. Resumption of speole pay* nent Is only anticipated, and famillari* y with gold values will do much to releve the sultfectof mystery with which t 1b associated In the minds of many ooklug forward to the day when uniform values shall again prevail. It nay lie that by wise legislation now i banking system can be established, ruly national in its character and ! icope, which will furnish a Hound cur- i ency of uniform value in every State i >ftlie Union.
