Oregon Transcontinental Line to Portland. füe Oregon Pacific Bnilding Eastward. fhe Flathead Conntry to he Tapped for Butte's Benefit Though Butte has hitherto been obliged to content herself with being the terminus 0 | a short spur railroad, the day ie not , jar distant when she will be the grand cen tral point in a vast system of transconti nental and other trunk lines of railroad, n ot to speak of net-woik of brunches that «ill lay tributary the surrounding mining end agricultural regions. Butte has been (ontsnt to give Helena the distinctiou of tsin: the greatest wholesale distributing point in Montana, yet she may, ere long, gMOine that position, and when she does •be will attract trade by legitimate meth ods, and not through such relics of bar barism ns the commercial license tnx, that WH 9 lenz "mposed for the sole object of driving all Territorial trade to Helena. It je now well understood »hat the Northern Pacific »ill < xtend its Helena & Boulder Valley branch to Butte, and those wbo ought to know suy tbat it WILL BE IN OPERATION to this camp by the time the Montana Cen tral is completed, if not sooner, the work ou its line betwoen Calvin's and Butts be leg generally light. Before tbat branch is «ell in opera'ion. arrangements will be made to complete the loop by building the direct line from Pipestone Pnss to Gallatin. This road will be of greater value to Butte than any other of the short lines in con templation, as it will bring her nearer to Eastern terminals than Helena now is, shortening the distance as compared with prêtent routes by about 125 miles. It will open short and direct communication with oil the best coal deposits yet discovered in Montana, at Timberline, Trail Creek, Liv ingston and Rocky Fork, and the conse quent reduction in tbecostof coal and coke will be WORTH MILLIONS OP DOLLARS annually to the industries of this camp. Ibis line will not stop in Butte, but it will be pushed to a connection with the main line at some point father West, and will be come the main line itself. It is quite natural to conclude that the through pas censer truins will be run on the shortest and most direct line, where there is the greatest passenger traffic, and Butte will, of course continue to furnish her best out lets with the heaviest passenger traffic, as ebe does in freights. In building t.bis short line the No-them Pacific will simply rectify a grave mistake, tbat has cost it many millions of dollars, and entailed great loss 1o this camp. A few weeks ago The Miner referred to the fact that the Oregon Trans continental would devote its newly ac quired funds to the construction of a system of branches, the mrst important of which was the branch from Lewiston on Snake River, to Butte. This road would give Butte direct connection with Portland, making a saving of about 175 miles as com pared with present routes, and would open up a series of 

RICH MINERAL DISTRICTS between the Bitter Root River and Pierce City. All those east of the Idaho line would certainly become tributary to this city, as well as the fertile valley of the Bitter Root. Since Sidney Dillon has ac cepted the presidency of the Oregon Trans continental, there is a better prospect of the earlv r, v,etruction of this important line, lie is too well acquainted with the magnificent traffic furnished the roads by this camp, to be behind in the race of the roads to get here, and his bands will be strengthened by the business men of Port land, who are very anxious to tap the mineral districts on the Clearwater, to draw ores to feed the smeltert at Portland. It is very impoitant to the people of Butte that a railroad to tbo Bitter Root Valley should be built as soon as possible, me products of the valley: tl.e lumber and ores of the Bitter Root range will be wanted here, but there is more. The Bitter Root branch of the Northern Pacific will hardly cross the mountains to the head of Salmon River before another road will be heading for that point from Wlnne mueca, on the Central Pacific. A glance at a map will show that this link will complete the shortest and most direct route possible from San Francisco to Western Mon tana. This connection is. ard Ä desired bv the people of San Bran cisco, and when the first Bitter Roo Euilroid Company was formed in 1883. the Winnemucca branch was yery soon un der consideration.

MUIHfl KOTES. ^ Vow Voot Body of la Bwndrsd Onnoe Oro in tho Mountain Lion—Sixteen Oers of Timbor for tbo Anaeomda—Driving Deep Down in the Lexington—The Coal Moaenros of tho Flathead Region. Messrs. Pete Conway, Dr. Holmes and B. Marchesssan are receiving con gratulations npon having made a rich strike in the Mountain Lion Tunnel, Horse Canyon. After boring the tunnel 600 feet, the lead waa encountered on Friday afternoon, showing up a four foot body of exceedingly rich ore. Samples taken from all over the face show up an average of 600 ounces of silver per ton. From the numerous rich strikes that are being made within a radius of a few miles from the center of Batte, it ie evident that prospecting is only fairly begun. The announcement by the Lexington Company of tbeir intention to siuk to the 2.000 foot, level, will be bailed with general satisfaction. There ie enough ore above the 1,000 to keep all the reduction worke in Montana in full operation for several generations to come. When it is demon strated by deep working's that the ore reaches to the other side, ninety-nine year leases will be more common than now. Superintendent Tibbey reports the Par rot as showing up as well as it ever did in all the various levels. The supply of ore in sight ie sufficient to justify the belief tbat this mine will continue its regular output throughout the next eentury. In answer to the rumor that the Ana conda would have to shut down for want of timber, a train of sixteen ears of timber arrived at the mine last evening. This supply will last for some time, and it ie not li kely that each a contingency will again oecur. at the ®' t g as It is occasionally stated by outsiders that tbe deep workings in the Anaconda mice proved that no pay ore existed at a depth of 1.000 feet. Tbe construction of the immense new works at Anaconda is sufficient refutation of that statement. Those works wers not built for fun, and will con'inne to redaes Anaconda ores until the workings get down to where the beat kille ail but salamanders. Captain J. C. Ks-r, of Flathsad Lake, eaye a large number of coal seams have been discovered during the fail, on the varioue forks of Flathead river. 8oine of the samples brought into the settlements are of very floe quality, and the indications are that some very valuable deposits of bituminous coal will be opened up next year. Several of the large eeame are lignite, but there is a large area of country underlaid with the coal, some of which, in the mountainous régions, is subjected to great pressure, and will prove of great value to the surrounding mining regions. Denver Republican: The typical old time prospector ie becoming scarce in Colo rado, and ie now rarely met with except in tbe frontier camps. There was a time, and not many years past, when all the large towns in the State were filled at this time of tbe year with returning prospectors, who were driven in from the mountains by tbe first heavy enow falls. Now, however, few of thie character of people are to be seen, even in the outlying towns of Deau ville, Georgetown and Gunnison. The business of prospecting has experienced an evolution during tbe past few years tnat is olten commented upon by tbe pioneers of the State. In years past it was customary for tbe restless and adventur ous spirits to take to the mountains every spring, ostensibly to prospect for veins or auriferous placers. Those who could aot supply themselves with the necessary pro visions and pack burros were ''grab staked," and it was indeed a luckless fe ow who could not secure enough "grub to take him to the nearest foot hills and allow him to live a comfortable camp life for a few months. It was in this way that the remote sections were opened up and the resources of the State discovered and brought to notice. Graduallv the entire country was pretty thoroughly*gone over, and prospecting on general principles, or wherever fancy might suggest, bas been abandoned. The all round prospector has been relegated, and more systematic methods have been adopted in the search for ore. It. ie no longer expected that a man will penetrate unknown regions and stumble upon bonau cas unawares. To prospect now means to go out to some defined spot, usually near the railways, where the ore, if any be en countered, can be shipped to market, and there prospect a vein by digging into it, or sinking a shaft in search of a deposit likdy to be encountered, on account °J_ the ' a * vorable geological formation. The cars »-« used iu getting to the place, and the days of the prospector are employed in drilling and picking, instead of aimlessly wandering over mountains and through guti hes and parks with an eye to the next good camping place, possibly be fore the smoke of ;tbe last camp fire has disappeared from view. Then, too, the depth P of the shaft or lenath of the tunnei must bear witness to the amount ol work done, and not a meandering J n® d ™,wn ov"r a soiled map, to show an aileged trav eled route. No, the old-time prospectors as a class are rapidly dying out in Colora do, and those wbo follow it now should be classed rather as miners than proa uectors for as miners they have a fixed purpose and a determinationto accoirn plish something, which could not always Û- .„id of m >nv of the men who regaroea all "materia? gold that glittered, and with whom the greatest strike was a sucker wh was willing to grub-stake them.
