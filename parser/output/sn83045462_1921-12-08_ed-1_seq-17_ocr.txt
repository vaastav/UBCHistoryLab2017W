Time and Elements Slowly Ruining Washington Statue ST ATI' E OF CJESf. 

WASHI.NT.TOX, WASHINGTON CIRCLE. 1 After withstanding exposure to all sorts of weather for nearly sixty-one years, the bronze equestrian statue of Gen. George Washington in Washing ton Circle at the intersection of Pennsylvania avenue and K and 23d streets, is slowly disintergrating and in urgent need of repairs. Gen. L. II. Beach, chief of engineers of the Army, has reported the situation to Con gress and has asked for an appropri ation of $2,500 to make "necessary re pairs to the statue," Unless these repairs are made "within a reason able time." he says, "the head and neck will be severed from the body of the horse bearing Gen. Washington." That condition, he explains, is due to the original work of joining the head and neck to the body of the animal, "which was not executed in a thorough manner." Furthermore, says Gen. Beach, a careful inspection of the statue recently made by an expert from one of the bronze WQrks, showed that there are numerous holes and open ?earns in various parts o?.the eques trian group. He say\ these openings permit water to enter the interior of the statue, where it freezes in winter and causes further damage. Unveiled In 1860. The Washington statue was "the work of Clark Mills of this city, the sculptor, who made the equestrian statue of Gen. Jackson in Lafayette Park, the first statue of the kind erected in this city. The statue of Jackson was unveiled January 8, 1853. and the statue of Washington was ; unveiled February 22, 1S60. The cost of the Washington statue and pedes- J tal was $50,000. An appropriation of ! that amount was made by Congress' in an act approved March 3, 1853. In reporting the bad condition of i [ the statue of Washington. Gen. Beaeh I asked for an appropriation of $ 10.000 | for the improvement of Washington | Circle. He says that that circle was originally designed and improved i many years ago and that the walks and plantings have been seriously I impaired by age and should be re placed. "Owing to the location of the circle on one of the principal thor oughfares." says the chief of en gineers. "it is important that the j planting should be renewed and the old asphalt walks reconstructed."

Establishment of a bureau for the regulation and development of air navigation In the Department of Com merce was recommended In the report of the national advisory committee on aeronautics transmitted to Congress yesterday by President Harding. "1 think there can be no doubt," the President stated in a message which, accompanied the report, "that the de velopment of aviation will become of great importance for the purposes of commerce as well as national defense. While the material progress in air craft has been remarkable, the use has not as yet been extensively developed In America. This has been due, in the main, to lack of wise and necessary legislation. Aviation is destined to make great strides, and T believe that America, Its birthplace, can and should be foremost in its development. Bill Sow Pending. "I. therefore, urge upon the Congress the advisability of giving heed to the recommendations of the committee, the first and most important of which is tliat a bureau be established in the Department of Commerce for the regu lation and development of air naviga tion." A bill to create such a bureau is now pending before the House commerce committee. The report, which supplemented one made last April to the President, recommended continuation of the air mail service and development of avia tion for military and naval purposes. Liberal provision should be made, the committee said, for maintenance of the Army and Navy air services, and for training of their personnel. The report emphaaleed the necessity of encouraging scientific research and the construction of new and improved types of planes. Efforts must be made to sustain and stabilize the aviation industry, the committee held. The first federal appropriation for highways In Michigan was secured In' 1823 through the efforts of Father Gabriel Richard, the only Catholic priest to- sit in the Congress of the United States.
