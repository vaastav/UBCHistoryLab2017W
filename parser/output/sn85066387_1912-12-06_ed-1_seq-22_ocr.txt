FRIDAY WORDS THAT CHEER FROM THE EXPOSITION MAKERS AS its Christmas greeting to San Francisco the Panama-Pacific international exposition, through President C. C. Moore, an nounces that "San Francisco is fully one year in advance of all previous expositions in the matter of general preparedness." That is news to make San Francisco's stocking bulge with pros perity and its head to swell with pride. President Moore's statement, published in The Call on Thurs day morning, is a document which should be read by all San Fran ciscans, and the advice given by the president, that San Franciscans, in sending their Christmas correspondence east, should include invi tations lo attend the 1915 exposition, should be followed. We must not allow ourselves to take the Panama-Pacific expo sition too much as a matter of course. Its development is anything but a matter of course; its progress is unprecedented! Procrastina tion has no place in its scheme. The thing to be done is done today; the things that have had to be done have been done on the instant. The $4,089,000 stock subscription which started the finances of the exposition was raised in one day; the site was selected early; the great exposition experts of the United States, men of international fame, were engaged in the first days of the exposition, so that the work would be started right; the foremost architects of America were called early to the service of the exposition and have given their services, their skill, their experience, their culture, to the cause of the exposition, so that when the palaces rise they will be the most splendid structures ever reared in America. As an indication of the standing of the exposition architects, the design of one of them, Henry Bacon, has been chosen for the $2,000,000 Lincoln memorial to be erected in Washington. The activity of the San Francisco workers for the exposition has touched a wire that has generated activity around the world. Twenty-two foreign nations have accepted President Taft's invita tion to participate in the exposition. Thirty-two states of the union have taken steps to exhibit. Eight hundred leading exhibitors of the world have voluntarily, without solicitation on the part of the expo sition authorities, applied for space at the exposition. Two thousand concessionaires have applied for privileges. , The world is awake and echoing to the call of 1915. and San Francisco must not become drowsy: it must keep up the interest it has shown in the past; the spirit it showed in subscribing $4,089,000 in one afternoon; the enthusiasm it showed when it deluged Washington with telegrams proving why congress should award San Francisco the honor of the exposition; the loyalty it showed when it aided President Taft to turn the first shovelful of earth for the construction work. President Taft promised Mayor Rolph in Washington on Wednesday that he would be in San Francisco in 1915 when the exposition opens. We want him here on February 20, 1915, with I'resident Wilson, to assist in opening the exposition to the world. For on the day the Panama-Pacific international exposition gates are opened the world will have the opportunity of seeing its greatest, most complete world's fair. And it will be "the exposition that will be ready." A mouse lost its way in the spectro-helioscope of the Mount Wilson observatory and caused queer observations to be made. Must have been a shock to Venus and other lady stars to peep into the glass and see it. "Dollar Diplomacy" — Who Would Exchange It for "Bullet Diplomacy"? ii O 

ÜBSTITUTE dollars for bullets." said President Taft in his message to congress, expounding the principles which made his administration contribute so successfully to the pros perity and dignity of the United States. And again he said: "Flat tariffs are out of date. Nations no longer accord equal tariff treatment to all other nations, irrespective of the treatment from them received. ::: :: * It is very necessary that the American government should be equipped with weapons of ■iation adapted to modern economic conditions." That is a word for reciprocity treaties. The Payne-Aldrich tariff cost the loss of the house of repre sentatives by the republicans in I**lo and contributed to the defeat ol the party in 1912. but it ha:-, good elements which will be of lasting importance to the United States, and those were the ele ments placed therein to propitiate President Taft, the machinery for reciprocity treaties and for the tariff board. Those constructive measures, hidden in the mass of what proved to be destructive party business, political dynamite, will be matters for which President Taft will be remembered. lations. All good economists can not but agree with him; all will agree except those protectionists who consider that American manu factures are "infant industries' , —who still picture the steel tr«st, for bail is crashing into the flesh, muscle and bone of a young American soldier? The clink of coin is softer than the clash of steel—more musical. President Taft's administration has practiced the highest sort oi "dollar diplomacy"—a diplomacy that not only conserved and extended the commercial importance of the United States, but in the interest of the United States preserved peace on the American continent. And that was in the interest of the world. Jt is indeed a rare and signal honor for any woman member of the Reno divorce colony, like Mrs. McKim-Yanderbilt. to be hon ored by an anti-cigarette smoking society. The Oakland park commissioners might send their "intoxicated faun" to the home for inebriates. City officials have been made lame counting money. The com plaint is not contagious. Consumer Is Also Vitally Interested in The Freight Rates Hearing 

CALIFORNIA industries are seriously menaced by the proposed advance of commodity rates on 4,000 items from all points east of the Missouri river to California terminals. At the hearing begun on Monday before the special examiner of the interstate com merce commission Californians representative of different industries lied that their activities would be impaired if the advances were permitted. The fairness of the interstate commerce commission in the past is sufficient to establish public confidence in its rulings, and it is not probable that it would permit an increase in freight rates which would do material hurt to the industries of the west and act so directly upon increasing the cost to consumers of articles in daily use. All freight rates are paid by the consumer, however much they are. or whatever the competition in of their sale. For instance, if the rate be raised on enameled cans used in the marketing of olive oil, the California oil manufacturer will put up the price of his product to I EDITORIAL PAGE OF THE CALL cover that cost. Should that price become prohibitive he must go out of business and the consumer would be forced to buy a foreign oil, the price of which would be set without the check of domestic competition. 0 In every freight rate hearing the public is a party interested. Too frequently it does not appear, and is not represented by counsel, but its interests are at stake quite as much as those of the producer. It behooves the California consumer to give serious consideration to, the hearing now in progress before the special examiner of the inter state commerce commission. With plenty of Greece on the spot the peace negotiations in the Balkans ought to run more smoothly. ''Willie Ritchie,'" the new champion, has bought a typewriter. Look out for light (weight) fiction. Honors Given by University to Mrs. Hearst Were Worthy Tributes MRS. PHOEBE APPERSON HEARST, a noble woman, was honored on Tuesday by the recipient of part of her great benefactions, the University of California, on the occasion of her seventieth birthday. Within a decade the face of the University of California has been changed; beloved but inadequate and obsolete buildings on the campus at Berkeley have given way to splendid structures of stone and marble, more beautiful in their prospect than those of any uni versity in America, possibly surpassing in sheer splendor, if not in historic association, any university group in the world. It is due to the generosity, to the benevolence, to the wisdom of Mrs. Hearst that the grand scheme of university architecture was made possible. Aside from her monumental gift of buildings and the archi tectural plan for the university, Mrs. Hearst has given freely in other ways. The university museum located at the Affiliated colleges in this city, now one of the show places of the city, is largely the result of her gift; the community life of women students at the uni versity, centered in Hearst hall, is* the result of another gift; scholar ships, private donations, spontaneous philanthropies, have come from this good woman. When the faculty and students of the University of California gathered to do honor to Mrs. Hearst they did well. The wealth that has been hers has been given with wisdom and graciousness to the good of the state and its most important institution. The goose that laid the golden egg must feel chagrined when she hears about the auriferous lay of the Petaluma hen. It's too late now to "do your Christmas shopping early." But you can still do it comparatively early. Los Angeles Indifferently Decides to Do Without New Charter LOS ANGELES decided not to become a "new city." By a vote of more than 2 to 1 it defeated the proposed new charter which worJd have made over the city government in a radical manner, introducing the commission system in such a way that the checks and balances, the safeguards of American government, would vir tually have been removed. It is a curious commentary on the interest that Los Angeles peo ple take in their city that less than one-third of the registered vote of the city was cast on a matter of the most vital municipal impor tance. The indifferent electorate must have been confident of the defeat of the new scheme. The commission form of government, adopted in other cities smaller than Los Angeles, has proved itself to be a workable system, but under the proposed Los Angeles charter more than the usual power would have been vested iif the governing commission. The charter was the creation of the good government party of Los Angeles, the party which has been in power for four years. The defeat of their proposition proves that no faction can count any longer on the blind following of its leaders. The people will think for and decide independently of the wishes of their nom inal chiefs and representatives. The comic anti-free lunch ordinance was defeated nearly as badly as the charter itseli That was a proposition to abplish free lunches in saloons. Los Angeles has more sanity than the antics of some of its more conspicuous factions would lead one to expect. SIFTING THEM Sailors GEORGE FITCH There are two kinds of sailors —real sailors and book sailors. The book sailors are by far the most attractive. They wear wide, flowing trousers and queer, flat caps and elng merry songs while they hang on the topgallant yardarms. They will stop work at ant time to dance a hornpipe and shout '•The sailors' life Is the life for me." These sailors, like the dodo, the sea serpent and the ornithorhyncus, are very interesting, but they aren't so. The real sailor is a different kind of a bird. He is a plain man in overalls with a few teeth missing at rollcall where the first mate lias hit him, and a disposition which assays 99 per cent gloom. His hands are eaten by salt water, there is tar in his hair and he is against the government. He sleeps in h bed which was made up when the ship was built and dog biscuit would taste like dessert to him. He has to wrfrk very hard and has no time to im prove his mind, because the mates are hired for their skill in Inventing jobs to fill his spare time. He only gets on land once a month or so, and when he does ho is not received by the mayor of the city with a brass band. Nobody Srivos parties to sailors home from the sea. Thf> most he can expect is a drink of whisky with a knockout drop in it, so that he can be persuaded to go back to sea while unconscious. The sailor is the only variety of civ ilized man who can be kicked and hanged on the features. When con victs are given a few discreet swats the state conducts an investigation and great newspapers sob all over their editorial pages. But when a sailor is knocked from the cathead to the bin nacle by the first mate who needs the exercise he only furnishes a little more literary color for sea stories. We are a civilized nation in many ways and the man who kicks a dog can not hope to be elected alderman, but when a sailor goes to sea the only way he can escape is to jump overboard and if he objects to being pounded on the hem! he is sent to Jail for mutiny. If we must have prize fighting for the amusement of the red-white-and-blue hlooded masses, the best way to provide entertainment would he to put a few newly escaped seamen in an arena with their officers and make the walls so high that the latter couldn't jump out. In time this would prove very dis couraging to the latter. IN THE EDITOR'S MAIL Flea For the Farm To the Editor of The Call—ln your Issue of this date. I note an article headlined, "Kickers Start Moral Cru sade, Pull Down Artistic Bronze as Indecent.' - After reading tliis article and a few moments of thought upon the act perpetrated by that "I am holier than thou spirit," I feel constrained to say that it is quite possible for too much of a good thing to be too much of a good thing and to ask you kindly to grant a little space in which I may place a few lines in defense of those commissioners and their purpose to replace the faun. If the "good" women interested in this matter will stop to think a moment they will discover that unwittingly and unintentionally much "prudery" has been manifested. Con stant watchfulness, effort and profes sion for the exhibition of virtue is not virtue. Venus at the fountain and the Greek slave in the statue are made obscene without the artists knowledge, not from their nakedness, but from the preten tion of virtue in the marked effort to disgukse. All deception is unchaste, self-excellonce and self-righteousness are unchaste. Any man or woman who assumes to be chaste and earnestly proclaims and against nature In Its purity is unwittingly in the. lust of un chaste living, for the beam is as great in the eyes of the evil tw?er aa the mote in the eye of the evil doer. Gentlemen of the board of commis sioners, set that faun up again, and let no "mock modesty" rule your office or wreck the works of art intrusted to your care. A. W. BROWN. December 4. 87 Third street, city. RING OFF Gasso —I just met your friend, De Puysinghauser. Is he connected with the wealthy New York family of that name? Passo—No. Disconnected.—Judge. HARD TIMES By THE POET PHILOSOPHER Hard times •will come ere very long, some prophets do affirm; soon things will all be going wrong, and grief will make us squirm. The seers may all be off their base, as they have been before; they like to scare the human race and make us sad and sore. And then, again, they may be right, their guesses may come true; if panics put us in a plight, 'twill be a howdydo! So let's be hoping for the best while fixing for the worst, and do our daily stunts with zest till our sus penders burst. Let's put in brine the useful scads for which we work with haste, economize as did our dads, and cut out foolish waste. It will not hurt us to believe that panics will arrive; the more of saving we achieve, the more we all will thrive. And if the panics do not come, but better times instead, if things keep up their busy hum, we'll be that much ahead. I sometimes think when i am sane, free from my keeper's care, a panic would not be in vain, c'en though it brought despair. For in these fat and golden years we cease to value cash; we go in debt upto our ears for every kind of trash. We buy a thousand foolish things, we are such easy marks; the dollars that we earn have wings and fly to beat the larks. Perhaps we'd learn to value wealth and try to save the price, if Panic came on us by stealth, and slugged us once or twice. WALT MASON.
