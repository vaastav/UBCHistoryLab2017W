I noticed in a late num ber of your priper thai the ladies are to 1 bold a Fair foi the benefit of a Band a bout to be organized in your town. It set me to thinking of the old Band of '25 year? ago, which, u.ider the leadership of Stevens and Criswell, and Shce'z, and Van Harp wiih his big drum, used to give out such music as 1 think I have never ! heard since. And the old "Potomac ? Rifles" ? I have seen a good many sol- < die rs since but none to my memory ever ( came up to the bearing of Hatntramck lor j ! a Captain, and Webb and Henry Boteler for Lieutenants, or Joseph Welshans for a standard bearer. How many of the j old set have passed away ? Keep alive 1 the remenbrance of them. I enclose ?2, with one dollar you ran j vote for Rev. Dr. Andrews lor the suit of ; clothes, and with the other you can take 1 a chance in the saddle and bridle for me. P. S. ? One thing I forgot, whether ? 1 Van Harp beat the big drum or clashed . the cymbals. Csn you tell me ? In answer to the above questions : we will stale that Col. Ilarotrarack, lien- 1 ry Boteler, Van Harp and VVm. Sheeiz have passed from sll^ sublunary things, but yet there is a spirit of*the 1 old Band'' still manifesting itself amongst some of our citizens.- Criswell's Cornel Band was hard to beat in musical talent and proficiency, and we are glad to state thai , evidences are favorable for tho resuscita tion cf the same with a few exceptions in i membership. I)r. Andrews has withdrawn from the J contest for the suit of clothes, but we j shall appropriate the two dollar bill re- , ceived for the benefit of the Band and re turn thanks for the same. An Abominablb Affair. ? The Cumberland Times of last week gives the following account of a little episode : which we would call mixed basis. How ever "every one to their fancy" as the old woman said : ? A gentleman arrived in Cumberland last Friday, in chase of his daughter who ! absconded Irom her father's house in i Martinsborg, and reached here in com- ? pany with a mulatto, last week. The paiy were found together in a house by i the agonized father, and the girl was lak- t en to one of the Institutions in Baltimore i which shelters each unfortunates. Her ' name is Wraith, she is about 19 years old, and tier family are people of means and respectability in Mart:n?burg. The mulatto was formerly a barber ii?- ; this city where he, with his brother, kept i a barber shop, several years ago. The ! night they got here they applied to a re- | spectacle colored man named ltobert Har- 1 rison, to be taken into hrs hoos>, stating ! that they were man and wife, but they i were nut admitted. They subsequently t obtained shelter at another. Nothing has been done with the roan, and presuming it would be the desire of Mr. Smith, we would not give publicity to the case did we not believe that tho ; feelings of the deeply commisserated par ents would be saved in the end better by < giving the facts to the public at once that s inquiry about it may the sooner cease. ? ?

The Baltimore Sim give-1 the following synopsis of the President * Messaj|8 which wis eabmitt d io Congtes9 uD Monday last : The President* message has least the merit of breviiy. and ii is to be hoped may become ;? model in that reaped lor Uio communications ul his successors. Often the annual report of the President la ihe iwu hu'j-es has occupied near about a page of this paper. Even the comments of the pre?* ujxin his stat meiits, recom mendations and argument* h*\e some times been about as long as the present document. V\ e are gUd to be relieved in thin message from surplusage and tedious verbiage, and the example thus sei might be safely followed, not only by C? e ne i al Grant's successors, but by some of the heads of depigments and bureaus in thier accompanying annual report?. Facts, ! figures and reasons, in as brief a compass 1 aa possible, are all that the public demanJ. ; General Grant, in a ?ord, has set a prac I tic&l example of retrenchme nt and refoiro in this matter which is worthy of genet <>1 ' official imitation. After enumerating the various blessings which we enjoy as a people, the Presi dent refers to v*bat has been accomplish ed in the matter of restoring the Sia;e government*, and to the special case of Georgia, in which he ?ceras to think that ! reconstruction in that instance requires to be reconstructed, ai.d recommend* a law authorizing the Governor ol that State to convene all the members originally o.ec ted to the Legislature, requiring each member to take ihe oath presciibed by the reconstruction arts, and none to be ad mitted who aro ineligible under the third clause of the fourteenth amendment.. I he loss of our commerce, resulting, as is al leged. from the war, will be the sul ject ot a special message. The restoration of \ ir einia is recommended, rind hope express ! ed that the acts of ihe Texas and Missis sippi Legislatures, when they meet, may be such as to receive the approval of Congress, *nd c.ose the work ol recon struction. i On the subject of tho finances thrf tone of the President i* generally healthy, , ! though cautious and very conservative, lie -hows an earnest appreciation of t!ie evds of an irredeemable and fluctua.ing currency and the necessity for a return to : the specie basis, for which, hd adinits, no substitute can be devised Immediate re sumption of specie payments, however, if i practicable, is not con*idered desirable, and such legislation is recommended 3d will injure a gradual return to it. I o ' put "a-i mi mediate stop to flactuation in 1 the value of the currency,'' it is suggested that the treasury bs authorized to redeem its own paper, at a fixed price, whenever preserved, and to withhold Irom circula i tion all currency so redeemed until sold I agaiu for go!d. In view of our increasing ability 'o pay i the President suggest* al>-o as feasible the ' policy of redeeming on i 3 and G per cent. loans as ihoy fecorae subject to be called i in, by the negotiation of other bonds bcar | ing 4 and 4j per cent, interest. I he , President recommemls the postponement . of a general r e v i - i ? > n of t : e tariff and tax- . ation laws for the present, but suggests n renewal of Ihe tax on incomes, at a re duced rate, bay of 3 p,-r cent , end this to { expire in three years. I he revenues ol j i this country are greater than the requwe ments, and may with safety be reduced ; . but as the funding in a 4 or a 4j per cent loan would reduce the annual current ex penses largely, thus after funding, juati- j fyjng a greater reduction of taxea than i would now he expected, he suggests the postponement of the question until the j next Congress, though instances of bur 1 densome discrioiination might now be modified. ; In regard to Cubi. while sympathizing ( with it, the content has at no time assum ' ed a condition sufficient to Justify a rc | cognition of belligerency, but the princi ; pie is maintained that Una government is its own judge when to accord that right. It i? hoped that the good offices of tha ' United States rrrsy yet prove advanta geous for a ?etilemen'. The subject ol the Darien carnl if fa vorably mentioned. I lie only grave ques ' tion which the Union ha9 with any for eign nation is that concerning the Ala bama clump. The President regarded i the late contention as misconceived in its scope, ;,nu .not calculated to secure a 1 heartv settlement, and therefore approved its rejection by the Senate as in the inter ests of peace. Ho makes quite a summary of the con siderations to be provided for beyond mere commercial clairo*, ai.d hopes the time will fOon arrive v*hen the two gov ernments can ?pppoach the solution of the momentous fuSjeel ? aiitfactorily.

The account yiven in Thursday s issue of our pnprr is mainly correct, as to sales of the Public Property at Harper ?

The second and third days sales began on Washington or lligh street with the Dwelling Houses built on the North side of that street, all of wbich realized good prices : Mrs. Boerly, *2, GOO; Mrs Dai ley $1,425; II, V, Daniels, $2,025; Dr. J. 8.

The terraced lull side, sloping on Washington street to the Armory grounds, affording tine build ing ground for cottage residences, which many years ago, dotted this portion of the town, with beauiiful and g?v and fl twery yards and gardens was disposed of. About 210 Lots, many with buildings ' upon them, were suld ? each of which contains sufficient land for future building purposes ? the whole of which have been laid c (T on a M*p, platted by S.

The future progress of the old town of Harper's Ferry seems to be now assured ? inprovement will, unquestionably, fol low this sale. As an instance, it is stated that ? gentleman contracted, in writing, for the exclusive right to dig clay, for brick, on a neighboring farm, and as an evidence of his earnestness in the business and his confidenco in the situation of things, paid two thousand dollars, cash down, to the c wner. The same may be observed a* witness- i ed in the sprightly springing steps of the ; citizens, not only of the (own, but also, of the people of the vicinity, who depend for prospemy in many respects, on the prosperity of the towns ol Bolivar and Harper's Ferry.
