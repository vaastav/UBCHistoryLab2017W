C., Nov. 9. Presi dent Wilson hag given substantial help to the Poindexter bill for the government opuation of railroads and coal mines in Alaska. The president endorses not only the Democratic sen ate committee proposition for a gov ernment built railroad with controlled ports, but he adds plso that the roads should be "administered" by the gov ernment, which means certainly that tliey should not bo leased or turned over to provide corporations. Then he gets to the vital thing in the Poin dexter proposition when he says that the construction of railways is only the first step; "is only thrusting in the key to the storehouse and throwing back the lock and opening the door." The president does not look with favor on letting the Guggenheims He says: How the tempting resources of the country are to be exploited is another matter to which I shall take the lib erty of from time to time calling your attention." The Poindexter bill an swers the question: How? It is, as the president suggests, along the line of 'practical expediency.''

The manager of the Columbus exchange was present ?nd said that he would be very glad to cooperate in the construction of such a line and said among other things that many of the farmers re siding along the proposed line would be glad to take a block of stock and pay for the same in work. The meet ing was presided over by Hugh Ram say, president, and Sam T. Clark, sec retary, taking care of the records. A good many people entered into the discussion of the affair, among them being Representative S. J. Smith who owns quite a block of stock, H. H. Kelly, president of the Deming Na tional bank and is likewise one of the largest stock holders of the Luna county line, Prank Barrett and other large stockholders, Sigmnnd Lindauer who likewise holds a large amount of stock, George Carpenter and others. 1 was finally decided by vote that the lines be extended to Columbus If ar rangements could be made to finance the deal which plan Beems very likely.

For many years ho has done the former, and never the latter. In a recent public address Secretary of Agriculture Houston complained that less than forty percent of our farm lands are in cultivation and that less than twelve percent of those In cultivation are worked to their proper capacity. He complains of Increasing tenancy and absentee ownership and at the same time calls attention to the fact as disclosed by the census that the value of farm lands has more than doubled in the last decade.

Mrs. Cahoon was asleep when the men entered the house, which is near the dynamite dock, on the bay shore of Point Place. The men demanded her money, received lately. Mrs. Ca hoon denied getting money and the men then demanded that she produce a registered letter. She produced the letter, but it contained no money. The men then thrust a gag into her mouth and searched the room without success. "Well we can get a ten spot for this." said one of them, as he grasped Mrs. Cahoon's hair in his hand.

The barometer continues high over the entire western country, with fair, cool weather. Low temperatures, how ever, are still lacking, with the ex ception of central Wyoming, where readings below zero are reported.

Conditions favor a con tinuation of fair, pleasant weather Id this section over Wednesday. Shall women be permitted to parti- j cipate in the new presidential pri maries advocated by President Wilson in his message? There is nothing in the constitution to prevent. This im portant fact is brought to public at tention by Congressman J. W. Bryan, of Washington, who recommends that the new primary law permit women to help nominate the president of the United States. This can be done by act of congress as well in New York, which has no woman suffrage, as In California, where women have the full franchise. Primary elections are not j constitutional elections. They are vol untary operations of volunteer party organizations. Any regulations can be made for them by congress and there Is every reason why the women should participate in the nomination ! p UL f,l bWIUlUBlCDi 1U1D .Till certainly appeal to President Wilson and Secretary Bryan who are known to cherish a deep and abiding desire for voters for women, but who have so far hesitated to proclaim their feel ings openly. In working out its plan for bringing the farmer into closer touch with the consumer, the agricultural depart ment's division of markets looks with favor on the plan suggested by the People's Institute for minor paper cur rency the so called shin plaster cur rency. The printing of paper money in denominations of fifty cents and twenty-five cents would make it much easier to settle bills for eggs and other farm products sent through the parcel post.
