Thomas attacked Hood, in front of Nashville, and achieved a glo rious triumph. This he followed np, on the succeeding days, driving him each day, and at lost accounts was far soith of FraoklinT Hood's army i3 about used DD.TTceir-wpunded fill all the houses along the line of retreat. Our forces have captured 9,008 prisoners, 3,000 of them being; wonnded. There are four Major- Generals in the lot, and any amount of Brigadiers and officers of lower grade. Out of 65 gnns which Hood had, Thomas has captured 60. Hood's army is retreat ing in the utmost confusion, and is almost rained. The Federal loss is about 3,000. Tha .rebels acknowledge a lots of 5,000 At the battle of Franklin, which makes (heir loss, in this adventure, over 17,000. Forrest attacked Rousseau, at Murfrees boro', daring the battle between the ar mies, of Thomas and Hood, and was bad ly whipped, with heavy loss estimated aiieoo. t .The reported capture of Savannah was premature, but Sherman doubtless has possession of the city ere this. He had it completely invested, bad taken Fort McAllister by storm, and had opened communication with the fleet below the city. He had also opened communica tion with Gen. Foster, and the two'Gen- erals had bad a personal interview. The railroads were cut in every direction around Savannah, and no aid could reach the garrison. Sherman had demanded a surrender, which if not complied with soon be wonld open bis batteries on the "city The entire garrison of Fort Mc Alljster jvas was captured. ' Sherman's march through Georgia wbb merely play. He took it deliberately, and his men are fat and in fine condition. The , lived on turkeys, chickens, and fiweei potatoes, gathered up in the richest portion of Georgia. They had no fight ing on the route. They completely de stroyed over two hundred miles of rail road, and vast stores of provisions which were necessary to the support of Lee's and Hood's armies. They brought over 7,000 'negroes, and ' thousands of mules and horses, which are to be put in a place of gaiety. oi Gen. Stoneman has routed Breckin ridge, in East Tennessee, near the Virginia line, killing, wounding and capturing many of his troops, and taking nearly all thia artillery. , rA large expedition of iron-clads and transports, loaded with troops, has left Hampton Roads, and sailed southward. Its -destination is nut known, but it is supposed to be Wilmington. - Reports from the interior of North Car olina, say that preparations aro being 'made for the reception of Lee's army, rwhich is about to leak out of Richmond and Petersburg. The Confederacy is fast going under, ' and cannot hold ont much longer. Its Congress bas made a pitiful appeal to foreign nations for recognition. England has flatly declined, as the other nations will donbtless do. An order has been issued, calling every officer and soldier who is absent from his .post, back to duty. The President has r also Issued a proclamation, declaring that, 'in consequence of credits allowed on the last call for 500,000 men, only 250,000 bad been placed in the service; therefore, lie calls for 300,000 more men, to be raised by volunteering, by the 15th of February next; after which time, the quota j will be filled by drafting. - There has been a tremendous excite "ment over the release of the St. Albans raiders, at Montreal. Gen. Dix has or' dered the people to organize on the bor- e der, to prevent farther depredations; and if any are committed, he says shoot the '-perpetrators down in tue act; or, it any escape, follow them into Canada, and do not release them nntil they are delivered .at his Headquarters. The Canadians are '-volunteering and hastening to the border, 'to nravent difficulties. The release of "the raiders is as severely denounced in Canada as in this country. Bribery is ' charged npon the Jndge and Chief of c Police who released the murderers. The "'Chief of Police has been compelled to re sign, and the Judge is to be proceeded c: against. Orders have been issued for the re-arrest of the raiders, and a number of n them .have been caught. A few such ex citements would stir np a muss with Johi Bull. ,i , ( m rtf Attkstiok, Soldiers!

Wc Second tike Motion. The following, from the Leavenworth Conservative, is sound. Printers hive no more right to be exempt from their share of the public burdens than men of any other calling; but when such burdens are felt by every class of community, and can be lightened without any detriment to the pnblic good, it should be done. Eve rybody reads the papers cannot do with- ont them and printing is necessary to all classes, in public matters or private business. It does seem to ns that printers are taxed exorbitantly, and in every con ceivable form. Congress did endeavor to make certain exemptions, but the revenue Commissioner, under some technical con struction of the law, has putlhe screws down to their very tightest. The result is, if printers do not want to ruin them selves financially, they are compelled to increase their prices; 60 that readers, of newspapers are put to an additional ex pense, business men pay heavier for ncc cessary work, and Government has to pay higher prices for printing that can not be dispensed with, and which increase, of course, bis to be made up by additional taxes upon the people. Wo say, take off some of the pressure: Tax oh Knowledge. We respectfully dedicate this article to our Hon. Senators and Hon. member of Congress, feeling as sured that they will give the matter refer red to, their immediate and earnest atten tion. We do not propose to go into an elaborate disenssion to convince yon that what we ask ought to be granted, it is un necessary. Now to the point. We want twenty per cent, import tax on the impor tation of paper, repealed. We regard this tax as directly closing the channels of knowledge; yon are cropping tho wings of information by imposing an enormous tax upon that, without which, our nation would soon become a mass of ignorant, unlettered beings, who wonld soon boast of being equally as learned as the celestials, or the rat-eating subjects of the Great Zycome of Japan. The present monopoly upon papor is unbearable; the advance from eight cents to thirty cents per pound, is beyond rea son. The import tax amounts to an em bargo, and permits our manufacturers to demand whatever price their avarice and combinations may suggest. Toe articles used in the manufacture of paper are many of them very cheap. Straw is entering largely into the trade at a mere nominal price. We shall thunder in your ears nil the prticulars, if you you don't give tho sub ject your attention. We hope that every paper in Kansas will remind our repre sentatives of the importance of this re peal. Conservative. Broad-Cast Sbed Sower. Messrs. Bell & Ryerson have purchased the right to thia new and valuable agricultural im plement, and have commenced the manu facture of a large number.

Count Seat. We learn that "the Connty Seat question is again being agi tated in this Connty, and that Watbena is about making a strong effort to take the prise from Troy. We have long observed that in very many of the Conn ties in Kansas, there is a bitter feeling against the County seat, when the oppo site sentiment shonld prevail. There must be some cause for this, besides local jealousies. We believe we can compre hend some of the canses, and shall take early opportunity to refer to them. Moore's Roral New Yorker. This is nndoubtedly the best paper for the farm, garden and household, in America, 'and bas become an universal favorite. No one who bas ever taken it, will ever wil lingly be without it. It treats npon farm ing, stock, frnit, flowers, and honsobold affairs, besides giving a large amonnt of general news, and interesting literature. Read the prospectus, and see what offers are made to subscribers. ES' The Topeka Record, speaking of Kansas papers increasing their snbscrip tion prices, says that of the Chief has been raised to 3 a year, when not paid in advance. The price, to-day, is pre-, cisely the same as it was the first week the Chief was issued, nearly eight years ago. Onr terms have always been 93 a year, when not paid in advsnee, but have not been strictly enforced in all cases. New York Ledoeb. This paper has established a repntation, and requires no blowing to recommend it to the pnblic. It employs none but first-class talent, and has a circclation never before attained bv a literary rjaner. It deserves it. The prospectus, in another column, tells its story in a few words, and says all that is necessary npon the snbject. A Thought. The poet so truly says "Well ordered home bib! belt detlrht la mile, And tweeieatall lh loili of bomn life; Thu be the rVtaile djjnitj and print." He shonld have added, and to make nice whits bread and biscuit, which sne can only do by nsing the Chemical Saleratus. jy Gen. A. L. Lee, we see by the papers, has arrived in Washington. We are cofident he has no" well-filled carpet- sack, the loss of which wonld rain many a poor man in Kansas. tW The papers report-good sleighing in Colorado. We see that Chivington's men have "slayed" a large number of Indians. .. 7 Ieclarlae Tkelr Independence. We are glad to see that the newspaper publishers are asserting their independence of the monopoly 'known as Pt inters' Union, in all the principal cities. Not that we want the journeymen printers to receive less than just wages for tbeir ser vices; bnt long snecess had made the Union members arbitrary and dictatorial. They bad forgotten tha rights of em ployer?, and undertook to be the bosses instead of subordinates. Time was, when a printers strike stopped tbe issuing oi city dailies. That time is post. Pub lishers have been long preparing the way for their own independence, and when the "sign was right," they took the man agement of tbeir offices into tbeir own bands. The printers "knocked off," but lo 1 their places were supplied with other hands, who had IoDg been privately train ing for the event. Newspapers have got the npper hand of the Unions; in Boston, New York, Rochester, Chicago, and oth er cities and the reform is spreading. The Unions have become secondary to the publishers, and their organ, "The Printer," is beseeching of them to aet with common sense, lest they go nnder altogether. By the following, from a recent num ber of the St. Lonis Democrat, it will bo ;een that the publishers of that city have resolved to control their own offices: On a Strike. Tho printers ore on a strike, and the proprietors are consequent ly embarrassed to get ont their regular editions. We have made the issue with printers on a question of wages. Since last Snmmer we have been compelled by the rules of their Society known as the Typographical Union, to pay sixty-five cents per thousand for composition, while in other cities in the United States the highest price paid is fifty cents per thou sand. The wages in the job rooms and other departments of our office have been correspondingly exorbitant and dispropor tionate. We concluded to atand this no longer. We asked the printers to rednce tbsir bill of prices, offering to pay as much as was paid in any other city in the State, lhis oner the printers have re jected. They have therefore been dis charged from all our omcea. Wo shall publish onr paper notwith standing the Printers' Union, and intend to whip it out as it has been whipped out in every other city in the country where tho proprietors nave- resisted its exorbitant demands. The pnblic must have patience with the appearance of onr paper for a few days. We shall soon have a complement of bands, and go on after the old sort. X5TGen. Pleasanton'a official report of his pursuit of Price, has been publish ed. We look in vjin for any mention of the mighty exploits of Jim Lane. The reason is, Pleasanton didn't see it. The Line papers are barking at Pleasan ton. Tbey pretend that it is because be .did not, in .a report of his own opera tions, go eff into a long eulogy upon Gen. Curtis and the officers nnder his command; but the thing that really hurts, is his treating Lane with silent contcmDt. Saturday Evenino Post. The Post is the oldest literary paper in America, if not in the world, and it appears to gain new life and energy as it grows in years, There is certainly not a more interesting or nsefnl paper, in every Department of news and literature, lo be met with. The prospectus of the Post, for 1865, and also of the Lady's Friend, published by the same gentlemen, will be found in our paper. Fracas in Holt We aro informed that a man named Pope, of Holt Connty, Mo., recently returned from the rebel ar my, and that one night last week, a party of men went to bis bouse to disarm him. He fired upon them, killing one man, John Baldwin, instantly, and then made his escape. Pope's house and out-build ings have since been burned to the ground. A criminal term of the District Court was held in this County, last week. There were ten cases tried, and bnt two convictions obtained. A white man was sentenced to tbn penitentiary for one year, for horse-stealing, and a negro for three years, for killing a neighbor's horse Served him right he had no business to be a nigger 1 t3T Col. Jcnnison has been placed under arrest, for disobedience of orders, Wa believe be was never distinguished for anything except doing pretty much as he pleased. We have not learned whether his present offence is military, political, or personal.

He hid a bill passed, once be fore, and a Commissioner appointed to audit military claims. Sid. Clarke was the Commissioner, and he lost his car pet-sack, containing all the claims, and did not find it nntil he had bought np tbe chances of tbe claimants, for little or nothing thus swindling tbe defenders of tbe StRte.

Now that Sherman's campaign attracts all eyes, a fact which I neglected to men tion in an account of a recent visit to Grant's headquarters, arqnires special in terest. General Sherman has not only teen, np to tho very moment of ahan doning Atlanta, in the closest consulta tion with General Grant, bnt tho detiils of the movement now in progress were the subject of the most careful delibera tion and discussion. One of tho last messages that passed over the wires, be fore the the interruption of telegraphic communication, was one of several thoas and words in cypher, from Grant to Sherman, embodying the final counsels and directions of tbe Lientenant General. In the same connection it may be add ed that many indications point to a co operation with Sherman by the navy. General Grant's unwillingness to fur nish troops for the movement the Navv Department desired to make on Wil mington has lately bean the subject of comment in some quarters, i'erhaps a desire to have the naval resources ready for another operation may afford a very satisfactory explanation.

While the NwYork Tribune doubts, very significantly, the peace rumors which are floating abont, it never theless expresses the following (also sig nificant) opinions, viz: "We believe, therefore, that the time has come for detaching the Southern masses from the fortunes of tho rebellion, and that overtures looking to tbnt end will soon be made by the President, either through his forthcoming Message or otherwise, as circumstances shall seem to render expedient."
