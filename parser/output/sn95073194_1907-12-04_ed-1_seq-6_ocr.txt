Mr. Forgan saw the president Secretary Cortelyou and Treasurer Treat and expressed his be lief 'that the banks throughout the country would soon be ia a position to resume cash payments. The subject is or peculiar interest to the treasury officials, because for nearly a month government receipts have been declin ing as a direct result of the scarcity of currency. Distillers, brewers and others who are required to purchase internal revenue stamps have not been able to secure currency in suffi cient quantities from the banks with which to pay for these stamps, and as the collectors are not allowed un der the law to receive certified checks or anything but lawful money, except at their personal risk, the result has been that even' a sufficient supply 6f stamps to cover immediate needs has been difficult to obtain.

AS TO CUUBtCr QUESTION Mit Defect cf freseat Syttesi Are Pesatel Ost ty Ckief NOT TIME FOR TARIFF Postponement ef Discussion of Re vision ef Schedules Until After Presidential Election Urged Ne cessity for Improving Waterways of the Country. Wellington, rjee X President Roose velt in bis annual message deals vigor ously with matters of national impor tance. Referring to the recent disturb ance in financial circles he points out that the boarding of money by the peo ple, instead of keeping it in sound banks, was the first cause of financial stringency and a grave error. He pays a tribute to the general honesty of the men engaged In -the banking, business. After quotations from his last annual message which dealt with tiie necessity of governmental regulations, the presi dent asserts that lus views have in no way changed and declares it Is the duty of the national government to embody n action the principles he then expressed. Disclaiming any Idea of advocating cen tralisation the president-insists upon the necessity for federal control of the rail roads of the country through the Inter state commerce commission, and also urges legislation' looking to the proper control of the great business concerns en gaged in interstate business, this control to be exercised for their own benefit and prosperity no .less than for the protection of Investors and of the general public. Waats Federal Crattv. Declaring that 'modern industrial con ditions are such that combination Is not only necessary but inevitable, the presi dent refers to' his message of a year ago. concerning necessary changes In the antitrust laws. He goes on: "I ask for full power to be given the federal government, because no single state can by .legislation effectually cope with these powerful - corporations en gaged In interstate commerce, and. while doing them full Justice, exact from, them in return full Justice to others. The con ditions of railroad activity, the condi tions ef our immense Interstate com merce, are. such as to make the central government alone competent to exercise full .septrgistea and control. "The. antitrust law-should be made both Laiorp.eafelentcuadmere lhTharmony.with actual conditions, it should be so amend ed as to forbid only the kind ot combina tion which does barm to the general pub lic, such amendment to be accompanied by. or to be an Incident of. a grant of su pervisory power to the government over these big corporations engaged in inter state business. This should be accom panied by provision for the compulsory publication of accounts and the subjec tion of books and papers to the Inspec tion of the government officials. A' be ginning has already been made for such supervision byrthe,. establishment of .the bureau ot corporations. "Among the points, to be aimed at should be the prohibition of unhealthy competition, such as by rendering service at an actual loss for the purpose of crush ing out competition, the prevention of lu nation of capital, and the prohibition or a corporation's making exclusive trade with Itself a condition of having any trade with itself. Reasonable agreements between, or combinations of. corporations should 'be permitted, prrfviatid they are first submitted to and approved by some appropriate government body. "The congress has. the power to charter corporations to engage Jn Interstate and foreign commerce, and a general law can be enacted under the- provisions of which existing corporationsjcould take out fed eral charters and new1' federal corpora tions could be created. An essential pro vision of such a law should be a method of predetermining by some federal board or commissi on whether the applicant for a federal charter was an, association of combination within the restrictions of the federal, law; The supervision established might be analogous to that now exercised over national banks. At least, the anti trust act should be supplemented by spe cific prohibitions of tile methods which ex perience has shown have been of most service In enabling monopolistic combina tions to crush out competition. The real owueia of a corporation should be-compelled to do 'business In their .ownv;aame. The right to, hold stock In other corpora tions should hereafter be denied to inter state corporations, unless on approval by the proper government officials, and a prerequisite to such approval should be the listing with the' government of all owners aad stockholders, both by the corporation owning such stock and by the corporation in which such stock Is owned." After calling attention to the benefits, which the legislation he urges would confer upon the country, the president says: "Those who fear, from any rea son, the extension of federal activity will, do well to study the history not only of the national banking actbut of the pure food law. and notably the meat inspec tion law recently enacted. The benefit to Interstate common carriers and 'business concerns from the legislation I advocate would be equally marked. The' Carreaer Qnestloa. On the question of the currency the president calls attention to his last an nual message wherein he pointed out that our present system is defective and showing the need of a change. In that message be said: "National banks should be permitted to issue a specified proportion of their cap ital in notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in legiti mate trade. This plan would not per mit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet the emer gency presented by times of stringency. I do not say that this Is the right sys tem. I only advance It to emphasise my beMet that -there: is need for-the adop--tioa of some. system which shall be au tomatic aad open to all sound banks, so as to avoid all possibility of discriai laaUetr aad favoritism.- Such a plan would tend to prevent the spasms of high money and speculation which now ob tain In the New Tork market: for at present there is too much currency at certain seasons ofthe year, and its' ac cumulation at New York tempts bankers to lend it at low, rates for speculative purposes: whereas, at other times when the crops are being-moved there Is ur gent need for a large but temporary In-. ewes In the currency supply. It'must be.. forgotten that .this question baahMss-men general!?, quite as much an bankers; especially !s this txz of stockmen, farmers and business men: in th west: for at present at certain seasons of" the year the difference in in terest rates between the east and west Is from six to tea per. cent., whereas in Canada the Linuspunaing- difference is but two per cent. Any plan must; ef guard the- Interests of western southern bankers as carefully as It the Interests of New Tork or "bankers, and, must be drawn tssMpetats-ef the farmer and the merchant no less than from the banker and the The. president continues:- J - v "I strain urge on r the congress the need of Immediate v attention to this matter. We need- a. greater elasticity In our currency: provided, of course, that we recognise the even greater need of- a safe and secure curreneyt There must always' be the most rigid examination by the national' authori ses. Provision she bema4e.for am emergency currency. The 'emergency Issue should, of course, be made with aa elective guaranty, and upon condi tions carefully prescribed by the gov ernment. Such emergency, issue must be based on adequate securities ap proved by the government, and must be issued under a heavy tax. This would permit currency being issued when the demand for it was urgent, while securing its retirement as the demand fell off. It is worth investi gating to determine whether officers and directors of national banks should ever be allowed to loan to themselves. Trust companies should be subject to the same supervision as banks; legisla tion to this effect should be enacted for the District of Columbia and the terri tories." . . ." Kat Ttase fee Tariff On the subject of the tariff the presi dent declares himself in favor ef post poning; all 'Consideration of the que-, tlon until after ;the' presidential elec tion. He says: "The income account of the nation Is in a most satisfactory condition. For the six fiscal years ending with the first of July last, the total 'expenditures and revenues of the national govern ment, exclusive ef the postal revenues and expenditures, were in round num bers, revenues. 83.e6.03S.eW. and ex penditures. 13,273,009. ' The net ex cess or Income over expenditures, in cluding in the latter the fifty millioas expended for the Panama canal, was $19O.O0.e for the six years, an average of about l31.6M.8ft) a year. This represents an approximation between in come and outgo which it would be hard to improve. The satisfactory working of the present tariff law has been chiefly responsible for this excellent showing.' Nevertheless, there Is an evident aad con stantly growing feeling among our peo ple that the time Is rapidly approaching when our system, of revenue legislation must be revised. "This, country Is definitely committed to the protective system and any effort to uproot it could not but cause wide spread industrial disaster. In other words, the principle of the present tar iff law could not with wisdom ,be changed. But in a country of such, phenomenal growth as ours it is prob ably well that every dozen years or so the tariff laws should be carefully scrutinized, so as to see that no ex cessive or improper benefits are con ferred thereby, that proper revenue. Is provided, and'tbat our foreign trade is encouraged. There 'must, always be as a minimum a tariff which will not only allow for the collection of an ample revenue but which will at least make good the difference In cost of produc tion here and abroad; that is. the dif ference in the labor cost here and abroad, for the well-being of the wage worker must ever be a cardinal point of American policy. The sole consider ation should be to see that the sum total of changes represent the public good. This means that the subject can not with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding a presidential election, because as a matter of fact experience has conclusively shewn that at such a .time . it Islmpossible to get men to treat' it from" the standpoint of the public good. In my judgment the wise time to deal with the matter is Immedi ately after such election." There has been no change in the mind of the president concerning the advisability of an income tax and ah inheritance tax. In the message he says: "When our tax taws are revised the question of an income tax and an in heritance tax should receive the care ful attention of our legislators. In my Judgment both of these taxes 'should be part or our system of federal taxation. I speak diffidently about the income tax beeause one scheme for an income tax was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court: while in addition it is a difficult tax to administer in its prac tical working: Nevertheless, a grad uated income tax of the proper type would be a desirable feature of federal taxation, and it is to be hoped that one may. be devtised which ' the, -supreme court will declare constitutional. The inheritance tax. however, is both a far better method of taxation, and far more important for the purpose of having the fortunes of the country bear in proportion to their increase in size a corresponding increase and burden of taxation. The government has the ab solute right to decide as to the terms upon which a man shall receive the be quest or devise from, another, and this point ia the devolution of property is especially appropriate' for the imposi tion of a tax." Dne Enforcement ef "Law. On the matter of the impartial en forcement ot the laws the message, says: . "A few years ago there was loud complaint that the law could not' be in voked against wealthy offenders. There is no such complaint now.' The course of the department of Justice during the last few years has been such as to make it evident that no man stands above the law. that no corporation Is so wealthy that It cannot be held to account. Kverything that can be done under the existing law. and with the existing state of public opinion, which so profoundly Influences both the courts and Juries, has been done. But the laws themselves need strengthen ing In more than one important point: they should be made more definite, so that no honest man can be led unwlt-tingl;- to break them, and so that the real wrongdoer can be readily punished. "The two great evils in the execution of our criminal laws to-day are senti mentally and technically. For the lat ter the remedy must come from the hands of the legislatures.- the courts and the lawyers. The other must de pend for its cure upon the gradual growth of a sound public opinion which shall Insist that regard for the law and the demands of reason shall control all other influences and emotions in the jury box. Both of these evils must be removed or public discontent with the criminal law will continue." Use mi IsJmetlMa. Referring to the question of the use and abuse of injunctions the president de clares: "Instances of abuse In the granting of injunctions In labor disputes continue to occur, and the resentment in the minds of those who feel that their rights are being invaded and their liberty of action and of speech unwarrantably restrained continues to grow. Much of the attack on the use of the process of injunction is wholly without warrant; but I am con strained to express the belief that for some of it there is warrant. This, ques tion is becoming more and more of prime importance, and unless the courts wilt themselves deal with- it in effective, man ner. It Is certain ultimately to demand some sort of legislative action. I earnest ly commend to the attention ef the con gress this matter, so that soma way may be devised which will limit the abuse of Injunctions and protect those rights which from time to time it unwarrantably In vades." -rAmong the recommendations made ia the message are for federal inspection of railroads, the establishment of an- em ployers liability act. and for the exten sion of the present eight-hour law. by the 'government. Ia ladasfrlal BWonntea. The president favors compulsory In vestigation by the national government of Industrial disputes, saying: "Strikes and lockouts, with their at tendant loss and suffering, continue to Increase. For the five years ending De cember 31. 1SS5. the number of strikes was greater than those in, any previous ten yean and was double the number In- the preceding five years. These fig ures indicate the increasing neea or providing seme machinery to deal with standpoints of the city country banker. , this, claw of drsaurbaacen in the Inter est alike yevthe employer, the employe and "fthe 'general paMic I renew my previous recommendation that; the con gress favorably consider the matter el creating the machinery for computes ly investigation of such industrial contro versies as are ef sufffcient and of sufficient concern to the or the country aa a whole te warrant the federal government in taking action.' The recent strike of the telegraphers is .cited as. an Instance where- such power mujuc praacawr have am Las TBe necessity of checking the evil ef child labor is pointed out with much di rectness. On the relation between capital aad labor the president assets that pub lic opinion must be aroused Tn condesaaa tkm of evil practices on both sides. The work of -the department of agriculture is given high praise aad the importance ef the, department pointed out. Cooperation with farmers' associations is urged. The necessity of a national system of Inspec tion and grading of grain, to correct evils complained of. is also pointed out. NMMaal Water Hfcswways. Showing the necessity for the develop ment of the national water highways the message says: "Our great river systems should be developed as national water highways; the Mississippi, witlr Its trib utaries, standing first In importance, aad the Columbia second, although there are many others of importance en the Pacific, the Atlantic and the gulf slopes. Thcvua Uoaal government should undertake this work, and I hope a beginning win he made ia the present congress: and the greatest of all our rivers, the Mississippi, should receive especial attention. From the great lakes to the mouth or the Mis sissippi there should be a deep waterway, with deep waterways leading from it to the east and west. Such a waterway would practically mean the extension of our coast line into the very heart of our country. It would be of. incalculable ben efit to our people. "As aa Incident to creating the deep waterway down the Mississippi, the gov ernment should build along its whole lower length levees which, taken to gether with the control of the head waters, will at once and forever put a complete stop to all threat of floods la the immensely fertile- Delta region. The territory lying adjacent to the Missis sippi along its lower course will there by become one or the most prosperous and populous, as it already is one of the most fertile, farming regions ia all th yorid-" nne sppoinieu an iniana waterways wBiuuHiun iu iu una uuinne s cuia- prehensive scheme of development along all the lines Indicated.

Far Festal Savings Banks, On the questions of postal savings banks and' the establishment of a parcels post system the message says: "I commend to the favorable considera tion -of the. congress a postal savings bank system as recommended by the postmaster general. "I further commend to the congress the consideration of the postmaster general's recommendation for aa extension of the parcel post, especially on the rural routes. These recommendations havo been drawn up to benefit the farmer and the country storekeeper; otherwise I should not favor them, for I believe that it is good policy for our government to do everything possible to aid the small town and the country district. It is desirable that the country, merchant should not be crushed out.'

The president says: "It is well to provide that corporations shall not con tribute to presidential or national cam paigns, and furthermore to provide for the publictaion of both contributions and expenditures. The need for col lecting large campaign funds would vanish if congress provided an appro priation for the proper and legitimate .expenses of each of the great national parties, an appropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thorough or ganization and machinery, which re quires a large expenditure of money. Then the stipulation should be made that no party receiving campaign funds from the treasury should accept more than a fixed amount from any indi vidual subscriber or donor; and the necessary publicity for receipts and(ex penditures could without difficulty bo provided."

Yearly additions to the navy are recommended and in the president's judgment the country should build four battleships this yenr. teaaoa for Parlfle Crater. Concerning the dispatcli of the fleet to the Iacifie. the president believes it should be shifted between the two oceans every year or two as a means of teaching officers and men lion- to handle the vessels in a time of war. Although the results of The Hague conference are declared not to have been up to expectations, a degree of good is saii to have resulted, notably a provision by which the powers taking part in the conference agreed not to have recourse to armed force for the collection of debts owed to their citi zens by foreign countries.
