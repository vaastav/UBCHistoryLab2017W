A Variety of Ladies and Gents' WINTER WRAPS Call and See Vs. November Marriages. Of the twelve months in the year November is reckoned in certain vil­ lages in Holland to be by far the most important. The four Sundays of this month are known respectively as Re­ view Sunday, Decision Sunday, Pur­ chase Sunday, and Possession Sunday, names which sufficiently explain the purposes to whieh each is put by the young people. On the first Thursday in December all the villagers turn out in their best attire to be present at the village fair and watch the respective couples perform the country dance which is the invariable opening of such events. On Review Sunday the un­ married girls and young men after the morning service walk up and down staring at one another to their hearts' content. Having made up their minds who to select on the following Sunday, the youths with the politest bows im­ aginable salute the fair ones, and judge from the way in which their courtesy is responded to whether success or de­ feat is to be their lot. The third Sun­ day is devoted to the less romantic task of obtaining the consent of the parents and arranging in business-like fashion the details of the marriage settlement. The stern hearts of those in authority having been satisfactorily subdued, all the following week the parson is busy at marrying, but not until Possession Sunday comes round are the happy be­ trothed permitted more than an affec­ tionate gaze, or, at most a tender squeeze of the hand. "The English universities,'" says Sfr LyonPlayfair, "teach their graduates to spend £1,000 a year with digioity and intelligence, while the Scotch universities teach men to make £1,000 a year with dignity and intelligence.

FAKBT, an en­ thusiastic student of natural science, has been made State Geologist of Ver­ mont. ARCHBISHOP WALSH says he is con­ vinced of the equity and necessity of the campaign against the British land­ lord in the matter of rent.

JUSTICE W. B. WOODS, of the Supreme Court of the United States, has taken a leave of absence for one year from the bcnch. His health has not been good for a year past, and rest was indispens­ able.

WASHINGTON GAZETT The Socialists •»f Chicago, by poisoning all the mployers, beating to death all the em­ ployes that don't blindly obey their mandates, and threatening to burn the city, expect te get a new trial for the Anarchist assasins now in prison there.

Blaine Jr. has decided to adopt journalism as a profession and will take a position on the local staff of the Times of that city, a stalwart Re­ publican organ controlled by C. L. Magee.

PBYOB, who is a figure of the New York city bar, has recently realized $100,000 on some investiment in railroad securities. The Atlanta Constitution] says Gen. Pryo. went to New York soon after the war without a dollar, and with no introduc­ tion save his reputation as a soldier in the lost cause. He acquired almost immediately a good practice, which has steadily grown until it now brings him $20,000 a year. He was paid $10,000 for going to London to defend O'Donnell, the slayer of Carey the in­ former. General Pryor still looks young, thongh he is far past the meridian of life He is straight as an arrow and lithe as an athlete. His hair, which he wears long, is jet black. THERE was found dead in his bed, in a miserable room on the top floor of tenement house, in New York City, last week, a man named Emil Osgrave. The Coroners verdict showed that he died of intermittent fever, purely malarial. The examination showed two other things, to wit that he had $15,000 in cur­ rency secreted under his mattress, and that he had taken vast quantities of pat­ ent medicines, purchased by himself from an adjoining drugstore, lfhehadhadthe sense to have submitted his case to physieian or taken a few heroic doses of quinine, Emil might have been in the land of the living yet, but he chose to fool with malaria without intelligence, and so got the worst of it.
