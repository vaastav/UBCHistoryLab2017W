Tt~ te In nnrl oa fnllnwa' 1*0 the Senate and House of Representatives: Ab a nation we still continue to enjoy a literally unprecedented prosierity: and It I* probable that, only reckless speculation and disregard of jgttlmate busIneHS methods on the part of the business world can materially mar this prosperity. No Congress in our time has done more good work of Importance than ie .present Congress. There were sevoral matters left unfinished at your ist session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will complete before our adjournment. ^... Corporation Campaign Contributions. 1 I again recommend a law prohibiting all corporal Ions from contrlbtlng to tbe campaign expenses of any party. Such n bill bus already post o? House of Congress. Let Individ mils contribute as they desire; but lei s prohibit In effective fashion all corporations from making contributions ?r any political purpose, directly or Indirectly. Government's Right of Appeal In Criminal Cases. Another bill which has just past ono House of the Congress and which Is,urgently necessary should be*enacted into law^is that conferring upon te Government, the right of appeal In criminal cases on questions of law. his right exists In many of the States; It exists In the District of Colum* a by act of the Congress. It is of course not proposed that In auy case verdict for the defendant on the merits should be set aside. Recently one district where the Government had indicted certain persons for con Iracy.in connection with rebates, the court, sustained the defendant's de* urrtsr; .while in another jurisdiction an Indictment for conspiracy to ohin rebates hus been sustained by the court, conviction's obtained under it. kd two defendants sentenced to Imprisonment. The two cases referred niay not be tn real conflict with each other, but It is unfortunate thai ere should even be an apparent conflict. At present there Is no way by bfch the Government can cause such a conflict, when It occurs, to be JVjgfy?' an .''.appeal to a higher court; aud the wheels of justice .are., block- . *WJ(&pni^bny.'real decision of the question, t can not too strongly urge , e tfassagc of the bill in question. A failure to pass II. will result tn serl* I isly hampering the Government in Its effort to obtain justice, especially | Satnsl wealthy individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may also event, ihe Government from obtaining justice for wage workers who are ;t themselves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of inferior court has been against them. 1 have specifically in view a re |:rccent decision by >i district judge leaving railway employes wttuoui rem> edy for violation of a certain so-called labor statute, it seems an absurdity to permit a single district judge, against what may be the judgment of ^ the immense majority of bts colleagues 011 Uie bench, to declare a law gv solemnly enacted by the Congress to be "unconstitutional," and then to deny to the Government the right 10 have the Supreme Court definitely decide V"; the question. Sitting aside of Judgments and Granting of New Trials. In connection with this matter. ( would like to call attention to the '* very unsatisfactory state of our criminal law. resulting in large part from * the habit of setting aside the judgments of inferior courts on technical!lies.absolutely unconnected with merits of the case, and where there is no f ; attempt in show that there hns^uny failure of substantial justice. It would be well to enact a law providing something to the effect that: 1 - ' No Judgment shall l')p set aside or new trial granted in any cause, civil v Wr criminal. on the ground of misdirection of the jury or the Improper adtjikor rejection of evidence, or for error an to any matter of pleading ' unless, in the opinion cf the court to which the application ' OTBWi-after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively ap- * sIS"^ ,W?'Wat 'he error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. r Injunctions. In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection " with the issuance of injunctions, attention having beeu sharply drawn to ' ihc matter by the demand that the right of applying injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished, ft is ar least doubtful whether a law abolishing altogether the use of Injunctions in such cases would stand the ' test of the courts; In which case of course the legislation would bo ineffccIBy^' ' tive. Moreover. I believe It would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use Lj&- of injunctions. It is criminal to permit sympathy for criminals to weukeu ^ | ' our hands in upholding the law; and If men seek to destroy life or propK&orty by mob violence there should be no impairment of the power of the ?-r'; courts to deal witli them in the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated, last year. g?;- In this matter of injunctions there is lodged in the hands of the judi- u Pfrf1 - clary a necessary power which is nevertheless subject to the possibility of " jj?v, grave abuse. It is a power that should be exercised with extreme care and ' should bo subject to the Jealous scrutiny of all men. and condemnation js^ should bo meted out as much to the Judge who fails to use It bodly when 1 ^ 'necessary as to the judge who uses It wantonly or oppressively. Of course *'1 | .a judge strong enough to be fit for his office will enjoin any resort to vlo- r' jli w .: ,e&oe or Intimidation, especially by conspiracy, no matter what his opinion 1,1 may be of the rtclits of the orielnnl nuarrel. There? must he no heslta $$ . tlon In dealing with clisonlor. Bui there must likewise be no such abuse of ,J injunctive power us is implied in forbidding laboring men to strive for ^ hX^' their own betterment in peaceful and lawful ways; nor must the injune?"v,V t'on UBcd merely to aid some big corporation in carrying out schemes for Its own aggrandi/.ement. It must be remembered that a preliminary inIwy'j : Junction In a labor case, if granted without adequate proof (even when nu;i ; thorlty can be found to support the conclusions oflaw on which It Is found,od), may often settle the dispute between the parties; and therefore if im* gj?.:f; ./ properly granted may do Irreparable wrong. Yet there are many Judget ilho assume a matter-of-course grantfng of a prelimiliary injunction to be pvC | the. ordinary and proper Judicial disposition of stftdi cases, and there have undoubtedly been flagrant wrongs committed by Judges in connection whh labor disputes even within the last few years, altho 1 think much less often than In former years. Such judges by their unwise action immensely strengthen the hands of those who are striving entirely to do away with , tho power of Injunction; and therefore such careless use or the injunc tive process tends to threaten its very existence, for If the American peop&SV: pie ever become convinced that this process is habitually abused, whether |^V;sri J? matters affecting labor or In mattjrs affecting corporations, it will be lip// weli-nigh Impossible to prevent its abolition. Ijflpfofo- hi connection with the delays of the law, I call your attention and K},^; the attention of the Nation to the prevalence of crime among us, and above ^ ' i ,' aiil to the epldemic oflynching anj mob violence that springs up, now in j one part , of our counttjr, now in another. Each section, North, South, . East, or West, has !'p own faults; no section can with wisdom spend Its 

IVICE TuSwWIte r IMPORTANT QUESTIONS , . i V - x time jeering at tJie faults of anothe* section; It should be busy trying to amend Its own shortcomings. To deal with the, crime of corruption it is necessary to have an awakened public conscience; and to supplement this 1)y whatever legislation will add' speed "antT^certitiritJ" lb' the execution of the la1??. ' When Wd'deiil with lynching even more js necessary, a great many white men are Jynohod, but the crime is peculiarly frequent in re spec! to black men. Tbe greatest existing cause bf lynching is the perpetration. especially by black men, of the hideous crime of rape?the most abominable in nil the category of crimes, even worfce than murder. Mobfe frequently avenge the commission of this crime bir themselves torturing to death the man committing it; thus avenging in ttestlal fashion a bestial deed, and reducing themselves to a level with the iirimlnal. Lawlessness grows by what it feels upon: aid when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere off their operations and lynch for many other kinds of crimes, so that twq thirds of the lynchings are not for rape at all: while n considerable proportion of the Individuals lynched are innocent of all crime. Go ernor Candler, of Georgia, stated on one occasion some years ngo: "I can say of a votJty that I have, within the lust month, saved tbe lives of. half a do^n Innocent negroes who were pursued by'the mob, ami brought tliam to trial In h court of a law in which they were acquitted.'' As Bishop Galloway, of Mississippi, has finely said; "When the rule of a mob obtains, that which distinguishes a high civilization is surrendered. The mob which lynches a negro charged with rape will in a littlp while lynch a white msn suspected of crime. Every Christian patriot in America needs to lift tip his voice in loud and eternal protest against the mob spirit that Is threatening the integrity, of this Republic." Governor Jelks, of Alabama, has recently spoken as follows: "The lynching of any person for whatever crime is inexcusable anywhere?It Is a defiance of. orderly government; but the killing of innocent people under any provocation Is infinitely more horrible; and yet-innocent people are likely to die when a mob's tefrible lust is once aroused. The lesson is this: No good citizen can afford to countenance a defiance of the statutes, no matter what the provocation. The innocent frequently suffer, and^, It is my observation, more usually suffer than the guilty. The white people of the South indict the whole colored race on the ground that even the better elements lend no assistance whatever in ferreting oht criminals of their own color. The respectable colored people must learn not to harbor their ? * ... ? j. - mi.I Is criminals, but to assist the officers in uringing mem w jusulc. hub (he larger crime, and it provokes such atrocious offenses as the one ai Atlanta. The two races can never get on until there is an understanding on the part of both to make common cause with the law-abiding against criminals of any color." ^ . ^ JC'otitlnueil'op Page Slx-Ky^ . ... .,r,-v,T> , FATE OF GILLETTE THAW'S ML IN JURY'S HANDS NEXT SUMMER 'ERDICT WILL NOT 8E RENDER- TESTIMONY OF WITNESS IN ED BEFORE NIGHT, IF THAT SOUTH AFRICA WILL DELAY SOON.
