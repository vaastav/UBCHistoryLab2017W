"The immense stocks purchased by our merchants at the beginning of this Reason seemed to argue a reck less confidence which was only re futed by the character of the men concerned. But rapid sales have amply justified all their expectation?, and the outside world can only won der what becomes of it all. '1 he spacious new stores of our bii'k blocks were filled to repletion with goods two months ago which have disappeared so rapidly that we can only solve the mystery by remem bering that all the new fields opened up by the rapidly extending lines of the railways are naturally tribu ' tary to Palatka. Congress will be at work for some time on matters of mere routine, but how many anxious hearts all over the country will throb responsive to the music of its whispers! Will Cleveland be opposed ;n his work of reform by a republican senate ? Will the divisions between the dem- ocratic factions widen or close firm ly in face of a common danger? The president's message shows a de sire to control national affairs in the non-partisan manner befitting an ex ecutive officer no disciple of the .bloody shirt can find aught to con demn in the dignified language of Secretary Lamar, but the republi cans have shown their enduring bit terness by the election of John Sher man, and their future course is yet veiled in doubt to the outside world. At last our district is represented by one of ourselves in the lower houe of congress, and Mr. David son has a worthy colleague in Mr. Dougherty. What a glorious career lies before a man so young who has been so honored by his people How honorable to himself, how use ful to the world may he make his life! How we shall exult in his fame and glory in his usefulness if he fills the measure of our hopes How we shall watch with anxiety .which earns to lo pride the oflloia ' II fa of "the man wh.t le.U P.is'.W and lifted from our section the re proach of Mich representation. No man ever carried with him warmer good wishes than those which await Charles Dougherty, member of con gress from the second district of Florida. ploreour woods, i-ee onr advantages and locate immediately. For no city in the state could pre sent 6nch inducements. From our Heights all the beauties of Florida lie spread before the strangers vis ion the broad expanse of our rest less river, the dark green orange o-roves, the solemn oaks hung with moss and the busy-thriving city with . the hum of industry rising from a thousand happy homes the block chimneys of the workshops the moving trains of heavily laden cars, the stately steamships of the inland and the tapering spars and white sails of ships redolent with spicy fancies from lands over the sens ! Back of us lie the musical pine-wood, the deep hammocks and fruitful farms all bathed in a soft atmosphere perfumed by the breath of a thousand wild flowers and fra jrrant shrubs and vines. What Q,th er city can offer such a combination? Give us a good roadway to any one of the dozen woodland lakes which lie within a radius of live miles and a suburb will grow up at the termi nus which will draw ajl its supplies from us, and will soon be joined to cur city by a continuous line of pret ty cottages, each nestling in a prof itable little grove. Is not the pros pect a phasant one ? Can it not he easily realized ? We cannot offer our guests the attractions possible only in a large city like Jacksonville; these same guests dislike to bury themselves in small hotels of the interior away from the telegraph lines and daily papers. At present, for them, Pa- atka is cut off from the attractions of the country by a dreary waste of o sand, impassible without -1 . disgust by any means yet provided. Bridge over this difficulty and we lave for them yet another attraction offered by no other city in the state. Leave Jacksonville her boasted metropolian advantages, of which they are already tired let St. Au irustinc advertise her "most ancient and fishdike smell;" let us offer ho tels surpassed by none, easy access ibility by water or rail and all the del'-o-hts of rural seclusion in the fin est country under the sun without the forfeiture of any comfort prized by the sybarite or the epicure With access to the country all our old friends will love us the more, and many who now overcrowc .Tiie.ksonville will make a winter home in Palatka.

Two years ago wc exposed the condition of our county j iil and were joined by Judge King, all our coun ty officials, lawyer and many influ ential citizens in demanding one that would not disgrace the human ity we all hold in common with the most abandoned criminal. The con tract has been let ami we shall soon have a county jail, safe, healthy and comfortable. Yet many thought it would be many yean before our object could be accomplished. Since then we have emerged from the ashes of the fire the new Putnam is nearly completed we shall soon light our streets with gas, and are almost prepared to welcome the ad vent of another railroad. What next ? Let those who are familiar with our surroundings real ize what a magnificent roadway could be cheaply built along Water street following the curve of the river under the magnificent oaks, magnolias and hickories which guard our front past the beautiful groves and cottages of the West Eud and over the Heights! Once make a comfortable drive over the deep Band of the first two miles, and the work is doue, for then we have a firm, level road ready made to our hands. Once give easy passage to the Heights, and visitors will ex- Two Southern Conventions. St. Lcuis Globe-Democrat. Among the other evidences of an awaken'mg interest to their own pros perity, the people of the Southern states are showing a decided determination to share in whatever benefits may be con ferred by an improvement in their river and harbor advantages. The two con ventions, one in Savannah, for the pur pose of aiding the cause of the South Atlantic ports of this country, the other at 'fuskalousa, fur tha improvement of the "Warrior and Coosa rivers, show that the interest is not an ephemeral thing, lia ble to pass away in a day, but is founded in a deep settled conviction that the fu ture prosperity of the south depends upon the individual and vigorous efforts of its own people. The object in these two conventions seems to be something more than a mere desire to secure an appropriation to be spent in the districts interested. Of course this is one motive, and a strong one at that, for it i3 quite a card for a congressman, either north or south, to benefit his district in this way. But be hind this motive there i;-, or appears to Ik?, a conviction that the future of the south depends very largely upon an - in crease of its commercial and manufac turing interests. For generators the southern people have been content to raise what their land produced and then hand over the product to others who manufactured it into marketable goods, handled it, sold it, and made for them selves whatever profit arose from the line of the transactions. This state of things has long been a grievance in the south, but until lately the business men of that section do not seem to have clearly understood hew great were their losses from not manu facturing, handling and shipping their products for themselves. Now, how ever, they seem to understand the situa tion more fully, and the conventions mentioned are more a part of a scheme of considerable magnitude by which the people of the south hope and erpect to control their own trade. It is a worthy object which they have set in view, and as their welfare is also that of the coun try at large all wish them success. Vast as this nation is, the well being of one portion is the improvement, in some de gree of all the rest, and that the people of the southern states should be finally aroused to the necessity of making ex ertions in their own behalf is the moft encouraging sign for the future of the south that has been seen since the war.
