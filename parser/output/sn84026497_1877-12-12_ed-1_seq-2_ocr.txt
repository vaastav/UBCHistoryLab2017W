EDITOR WRDXHSDAT HORXIM, DEC II, 5877. Our Washington Letter. Fpoclal to tlm I!i:rt ni.irAW. Washington, D. C, Dec. 8, 77 Kvfrybotly appears to find some thing to commend in tho President's first annual message, and somttliiug to ii?sent from. Ila merits, as a com prehensive, rell-wrilten State docu ment ia conceded by all, Tho follow ers of Bland and Kwing are mad, and tlieir reserve fund of profanity was never nearer complete exhaustion and total collapse than now, from the al most continuous drafts on it since the President's attitude on the silver and resumption matters becams cuthort tively known. When the President authorized the denial of the statement imputed to him to the effect that he would veto the bills engineered through the House by those two gentlemen, the conclusion was jumped at that lie was really in accord with their purpose and that his' influence was assured in tlieir behalf. They had both safely run the gauntlet of the House, the prospect was thought good for their passago by the Senate, and the early adoption of the views embodied in them by the country in its financial policy, was deemed a foregone conclu &ion. The message came as a thunder bolt from a cloudless sky. There are signs of an attempt to rally, however. Bland is reported to have said 'that the adhcreuts of his bill are prepared - to force extreme measures, and to have threatened the alternative to the Pres ident cither to smother his convictions and lend a helping hand or to prepare himself to administer the Government without appropriations. It is idle to cite intelligent oppo nents of the ''Southern Policy" to the tolerance wrought thereby among Ku Klux Democracy or elsewhere, when uot,one of the participants in the butchery of the Chisholms has been made to suffer for that shocking bar barity, and when a man, in recognition of his leadership in a crime equally atrocious agaiust political opponents, is forced into a seat in the highest leg islative body known to our form of government, by the solid vote of the party representatives, aided by such votes as could be secured from the pp- position oy aiiegea corruption or ter rorism. Nor will those believing that the continued supremacy of the great political party that fought the war of the Union is still necessary to the per petuity of free institutions and repre sentative Government, be persuaded into an endorsement of a policy which lias reacted so disastrously upon its organization throughout the late in surrectionary States, as to leave it practically dead, with the rifle-club Democracy never more firmly en trenched in the position it vacated. Whatever may bo said to the contrary, events In file Senate during the past two weeks must be accepted as - indi cating the virtual reunion of the Re publican party leaders against the fur ther encroachments of exultan, arro gant Democracy under the dictation of the "Solid South." Polk, the latest successor to the im mortal Fifzhugb, appears to have yielded to hallucinations that will prove as fatal to his aspirations as those entertained by the latter gentle man did to his. It is now said thatiu order to secure his calling and election Lis promises of official favors were so recklessly given that about forty im portunate office-beggars were appoint ed to positions under bira in excess of those provided for by law ; and when pay day came around nothing was left to recompense them for their ar duous services in keeping forty or more chairs warm in out-of-the-way corners on the House side of the Capitol. They set up an indignant howl of protesta tion at such treatment. Polk, in his dismay, appealed to his party to vote jffictent money from the public fuads to pay each a month's salary, so he , auld satisfy the demands, discharge nd pack them off to the homes they hud been induced to leave to serve tlieir country. Such a resolution is said to Lave been prepared, and an ef fort will be made to pass it. There is not the slightest warrant in law for this contemplated raid on tljp Treasu ry, and it can be regarded as nothing 4 a flagrant piece of robbery, to re tt"Keform" Democrat of obliga ' 'jally contracted to secure his own preferment. His fate is proba bly sealed, whatever course it may bo decided to adopt towards his victims of misplaced confidence. Out of the 1800 bills sntroduceJ at the Extra Session, all passed except 1 1798. That is, at a session reudcrcd necessary by Democratic hate and malice towards the Army and Navy, continued seven weeks, at a cost of many thousands to J'ie taxpayer, just two bills, which should have been passed last winter, were worried through. It is not very easy to see whero the economy comes in. The stampede of the Sioux Indians in process of removal from their reser vation to the Missouri, is regarded at tho War Department and at tho Indian Office as ominous of another Indian war. The visit of General Ord and other officers from the Rio Gtaude to give their views of the prospects there, has been followed by orders for reinforcing our Army in that quarter; and the General's views, as ho is reported to have expressed them, leads to the con viction that the complications on our Southern border may easily lead to overt acts of war at any moment. . The proceedings of Congress since the opening of the regular session have been devoid of public interest. All are awaiting a renewal of the struggle transferred to this session, aud which it is believed is inevitable. Peterson's Magazine for January is the most superb number ever issued of that popular lady's book. There are two steel engravings, "Cupid iu the Rain," and "Borrowed Plumes." Be sides these, there is a double-size Paris fashion plate, elegautly colored, a pic ture in itself ; and also two very beau tiful colored patterns for working Ornamental table cloths in crewel. In all there are aboot fifty engravings in the number. The stories are all orin- O nal, ard by the best authors. With this number appears, as a supplement, a full-size diagram pattern for a Coat Bodice for a lady, the last thing in fashion. This alone is worth the price of the number. The price is astonish ingly low, viz : two dollars a copy for one year, postage paid. T clubs it 13 lower still, viz : five copies for $8.00, or seven for SI 0.50, with . an extra copy for getting up the club, all post age free. Specimens are sent gratis, to get up clubs.
