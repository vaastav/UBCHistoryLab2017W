POINTS IN TAFT'S MESSAGE President Taft's first message to i Congress spreads over 'steen col I limns and is not as well written j from a literary point of view as the state papers of former President Roosevelt. Following the usual j custom nearly the first half of the message is devoted to recounting tl e foreign affairs and js both too lengthy and uninteresting for quota tion. | When he reaches the tariff ques tion his treatment of that subject will make him few friends in the west and middle west in the great body of the people who did not re ceive justice and are not able to set that the party pledge for downward revision was honestly met in the passage of the Payne till. lie ex presses the hope that he will be able to handle the maximum and minimum features without arousing hard feeling and discriminations from the foreign countries concern ed in the varying duties. He hopes against hope that the present tariff will he allowed to stand awhile and be tested out on account of the fact especially that revision disturbs and renders business uncertain. He recommends a ship subsidy measure to build up American Mer chant Marine. Lines from the Atlantic seaboard to eastern coasi of South America and also from the west coast to China Japan and the Philippines. The subsidy plan how ever we do not believe will accom plish the purpose sought. A pro per method would be to allow Am erican capital- to buy ships where • hey can get. them cheapest and fly the American f!:ig. It lias heen -hown that ships of foreign make •an he bought for about one-half what they can be built for in Ameri can ports. In addition there is the difference in wages of American S'aman and the results will not k.:ep the freight money in Ameri can hands but will only make p<>.»- -ible another gigantic trust to which the country must pay tribute. We have taken the disagreeable of his message first but nrar.j paragraphs follow which have very strong merit and it is to be hoped that Congress will largely follow the recommendation of the executive. Separate statehood for Aaizona and New Mexico is favored, the voting on constitution and statt officials to be held separately. Government of Alaska by a gov* ernor and executive council, but no legislature, is advised. Drastic laws against the impor tation of "white slaves,or trans portatiryi across national or state litres are asked. Reorganization of the depart ment of state upon more modern lines in furtherance of foreign trade is necessary. Pensions for superanuated gov ernmer.t employes is approved. One of the worthy subjects pres sed upon Congress for consideration i> the Postal Savings Banks. H<» states that their chief purpose is to teach habits of thrift among tin people. They are desired by Un people he is convinced and alth< they are opposed yet their adoption will be successful and will in n< way interfere with private banking. He staves off the proposition of d< - laying action until the Monetary Commission should report on tl e ground that there is no reason wh\ they should be united and believes that the Carter bill which was con sidered at the last session was » very strong measure covering all the essential features for a good start. The next in importance the President considers that of improv ing the methods of legal procedure in the courts. He notes that prom inent jurists and Bar Associations are alarmed about the frequent miscarriage of justice in our crimin al trials and the long delays and high cost to the litigant in oui cfvil actions. He points out that lynch ings—those outrages on civilizat'on in America —are often times caused by the very fact that the people have well grounded fear that the court will not mete out justice nor set adequate penalty upon the criminal. He urges the appoint ment of a commission to simplify the procedure in the federal courts j which are admittedly better than 1 most state courts but should le I hotter examples to the State Courts. ! In this connection he comes to the platform pledge to modify the jstatute under which injunctions issue. The ends of justice will hest b» ; met and the chief cause of com plaint against ill-considered injune : tions without notice will be remov jed by the enactment of a statute | forbidding hereafter the issuing of any injunction or restraining order, | whether temporary or permanent, by any federal court, without pre vious notice and a reasonable oppor tunity to be heard in behalf of par ities to be enjoined, unless it shall | appear to the satisfaction of the I court that the delay necessary to give such notice and hearing would result in irreparable injury to the complainant, and unless also the court shall from the evidence make a written finding, which shall he spread upon the court minutes, that immediate and irreparable injury is likely to ensue to the com plainant, and shall define the in- J jury, state why it is irreparable! ind shall also indorse on the order 1 issued the date and the hour of the | issuance of the order. Moreover,; every such injunction or restraining j >rdtr issue without previous notico md opportunity by the defendant : to be heard should by force of thei statute expire and be of no enert after seven days from the issuance! thereof, or within any time less than that period which the court may fix, unless within such seven days or such less period, that in junction or order is extended or renewed after previous notice and opportunity to be heard.
