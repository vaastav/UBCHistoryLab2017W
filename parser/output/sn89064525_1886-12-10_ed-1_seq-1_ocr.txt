Many of the Kniyht-s of Labor of Chicago are sympathizers with the condemned anarchists. Congressman Price of Wisconsin died on Monday. He was one of the prominent men of the state. ^During the past three in-«riths the Manitoba Railroad company shipped 10,000,000 bushels of wheat out of Dakota. Arnold's flour "mill near St. Cloud was destroyed by fire on Thursday evening of last week. It Wiil be re­ built in the spring. The city council of St. Paul has amended the saloon ordinance so as to allow the licensing of 700 saloons, being an increase of 100. Th»» man Who thinks he is Gov. Elect Ames is taking a trip through the eastern states. He will return in time to be'Sworn in in January. The presidents message to congress is printed on ths 2nd and 3rd pages of this issue. It is an umisnslly lengthy state paper, and is not otherwise a re­ markable document. Ono of the rebel guards nt. Ander sonville prison has been appointed to a government position in which his. duties will be to decide upon granting pensions to soldiers who were in the union nrniv. The filthy details in Campbell di­ vorce case are cabled to the American newspapers and published daily. It seems extravagant to go thousands of miles for nastiness that' is abundant iu any divorce court. The German government wants the standing army increased 40,000 imme­ diately, and it is claimed that this is necessary in order to insure the peace of Europe. Other nations are also in­ creasing their armies. San Francisco has been wild the past week over speculation in .mining stock and thousands of dollars .have been made and Most. The excitement is subsiding and stocks are getting back to their former value. The Minneapolis Millars' Union has broke up and the Northwestern farm­ ers may now Jive in safety. If all the .'•our m)lls in the state were destroyed the grangers would probably be en­ tirely free from "slavery." The St. Pa^'papers are now proud­ ly referring to Minneapolis and St. Paul Hs the twin cities. Minneapolis, with her 50,000 more population and greater prosperity, doesn't approve the claim of St. Paul's equality, and rightly insists" that she is the real me­ tropolis of the Northwest. WASHiNftTON, Dec. 4.—Gen. John B. Clarkj clerk o( the house of represeetfi tives, has completed and caused to be printed an unolScml lit! of meuibirs of the house for the fiftieth congress. He tia^siflies tin-m as "lo8 dcmucrats. 152 republicans and 4 independents, with one vecanoy (Rhode Islanil) to he filled probably by a republican. One hundred and ninty-Sve of the number are old membersin the present .congress. Of the old members one hundred are democrats and ninty-live republicans. If the independents divide as they are expected to do, equally between the two sides, it will gtve the democrats a majoity.of fourteen in a full house. Frontier Adventures. From the Poirieer Press. Prof.iW.,F Carr and Samuel Chute engaged in surveying «ut on Nicollet avenwe, Minneapolis near the Washburn home, were attacted yesterday afternoon by a large eagle. The bird dropped like a bullet and, knocking Chute's cap from his head, assailed him with great fury. The man caught up a crow bar,and and for a few moments defended himself in an unequal «mbat, calling justiiy lor his com panion. Prof. Carr coming up, the sayage bird turned upon him,caught him by the leg, and threw him down, tore his trouses, and sinking his .talons in the fatty part oi ^%3t£*^ t* if Duluth's large elevators are to,be WASHTKG'roS.jSpocial Telegram, Dec. rebuilt. 4—Tbcre are conflicting reports as to .. ---.• ,, the condifion of tlie president's health.

LITTLE FALLS, MORRISON .MINNESOTA. FRIDAY, DEC. 10. 1886 tism and nothing ore, and that he is exceedingly restive at the enforced con linement, particularly just at this time. A man.vfho weighs 260 pounds, works fifteen hour- a day, lives high and takes no exercise is not thought much of by insurance agenm when he has'-'rheumii--1' tism in^both hneejoihti. For the past two days the president has kept to his room, in the hope that its even tempera­ ture Would effect an early recovery, He has for years been subject to infrequent attacks of this sort,' which usual ly, as now, located in tendons about the knee and confine hiui to his room for three or four dfiys. The present oue is! yielding to treatment, and will no doubt pass away in a day or two. You have heard hundreds of men, when speaking of Sullivan, say, "He wins by brute strength," and I have seldom seen a man who advanced lite truth, which is that Sullivan is as clever as any man. His unquestioned ability as to being the hardest hitter ever seen lias caused the overlooking of the fast that his blow is always planted where it will do the most good, either upon the jaw or jugular again it is certain that could an adversa­ ry so land his blow, Sullivan v^juld fall as Quickiey as another, and yet, having knocked out about GO men. he has never been harmed*' The truth is that Sullivan is a careful, scientific tighter. You haye heard how John Barleycorn had got the better of him so that he couldn't stay. The recent Sun Francisco mill furnished him an wpponent who for years has been in training,, that wh.en the occasion offered he might meet Sullivan in the pink of condition. Yet the first round saw Ryan winded, while Sullivan is reported finishing the battle perfectly fresh. Then rumor said Sullivan might not stand punishment. The chances are that Paddy gave him more than one hard rap, and yet we find him doing his work at the finish just like machinery. Do I think his equal as a pugilist ever trod the earth? Certainly not. Take the records of the Englishmen. When­ ever a man was knocked out with the raw uhseven, ii was considered a iluke, and don't think that Tom liver, Ned Price Or lis leg/ inflicted a serious wound. The bird then mdnnted to the collar Of the infortunate man and geemed determained to hear himi away bodily. But just #t this crisiaMi Otbers Came up and by their united efforts the. the bird of liberty w*s_ finally copqtie^ and'eecurely pihfioned It was foua,d that,his wjngs measumh 9 feet and 10 Inches froiBu tip'to tip, and his taio.a^ were orer four iuches lo ng. The places whercxh^* made the atucfe vim nCaar when die den of wolves had been, fotuaid the previous week. The capture of the eagle goes to explain the (ftctrtbat latley the iarmers ia the vicinity of kthe Washburn hojbe- have John C. Heeneu ever put a man to sleep. The latter in bis fight with John Morrisy could Itit his man just as oue would strike a sand bag, and still ,the latter lasted hn.ir enough Is win the fight Hoy many times do you think that Sullivan would have been forced lo swing his right on such a man as Morrisy Why, the first round would have ended the fight. Sullivan has knocked out 20 or 30 men wilh pillows on his hancls, and the Roman gladiators couldn't haul enough with brass knuckles to end the battle at a single blow. ,, Even in imagination the ancients never conceived such a hittfer as Sullivan. Achilles, Ajax, and those babies who were supposably out for the 3tuff, yet when the gods wished them to win they furnished a club or a big rock, and old Sherm Thurston and Dad Ryan'' were about ri^ht- when, after reciting the exploits of prize fighters for all time, they finished with: "John L. Sullivan was placed on earth to show 1 lie 19th century what could be done in the shape of a man."—Chicago News.
