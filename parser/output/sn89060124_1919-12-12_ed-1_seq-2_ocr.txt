Senato. fick, of the .timore city, will introau in the General Assembly .posing an amendment to the Constitution to fix the compensation of mem bers of the two houses at $lO per diem. If the bill passes and the proposal is approved at the elec tion next year, the desired in crease will be available for mem bars of the General Assembly of 1920. The present compensation is $5 per diem, mileage, which in no case exceeds S9O per annum, and $25 for postage. Doorkeep er receive the same compensation. During recent sessions efforts have been made to secure an in crease in salaries, but no result has followed. Mr. Frick decares that it is impossible for a mem ber to live in Annapolis these days on $5 a day, a salary which was fixed by the Constitution in 1867. He said that because of the excess of his living expenses over his income during the legis lative session he is disposed to regret that he accepted a re-elec tion. 

ARBITRATION FOR LABOR DISPUTES The following extract is from President Wilson’s late message to Congress: Labor not only is entitled to an adequate wage, but capital should receive a reasonable return upen its investment and is entitled to protection at the hands of the government in every emergency. No government worthy of the name can “play” these elements against each other, for there is a mutuality of interest between them which the government must seek to express and to safeguard at all cost. The right of individuals to strike is inviolate and ought not to be interfered with by any process of government, but there is a predominant right, and that is the right of a government to protect all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the challenge of any class. The government, when it as serts that right, seeks not to an tagonize a class, but simply to defend the right of the whole people as against the irreparable harm and injury that might be done by the attempt by any class to usurp a power that only gov ernment itself has a right to ex ercise as a protection to all. In the matter of international disputes which have led to wan statesmen have sought to set up as a remedy arbitration for war. / Does this not point the way for the settlement of industrial dis putes, by the establishment of a tribunal, fair and just alike to all, which will settle industrial disputes which in the past have led to war and disaster? Ameri ca, witnessing the evil conse quences which* have followed out of such disputes between these contending forces, must not ad mit itself impotent to deal with these matters by means of peace ful processes. / Order of Publication In the Matter of the Petition of The Greenwood Farm Company, of Prince George’s County, Maryland, for dissolution.
