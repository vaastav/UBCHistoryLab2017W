protection tection dlsouBBlon which has BO suddenly spnJI up as n element of discord la tho nueorly composed ranks of tho Tories and Mugwump Unionists continues to crow and to absorb public attention It Is i plain that tho protectionist wine of the pay f assuming serous proportions and I only It would grow no powerful D t fore tho Government to five legislative sanction t Its antlfroo trado feel Inn we should havo tho pleasure of seeing this Ministry of coercion and Imprisonment fall In a heap like a house of cards The Unionists are free traders to I man and there I little doubt that men the Chamberlain or more particularly of the John Bright stamp would rather bring down homo rule upon themselves than suffer any attack upon the Idol of absolute fro trade Unhappily wo cannot hope for any such suicidal action for tho present at least The magnates of tho Tory parr who n landholders depend for their Incomes on tho prosoerlty of the farmers are nil protec tionists at heart and In fnt so are the Tory Ink and file In whose minds protection and hatred of foreign laborers are mysteriously connected so that nrotoctlonlst sentiments any 0 said to rule in Torydom Dut the rulers in tho Government are power lovlnl Tories rt and fiscal reformers after ward They know their ship cannot float with out the help of tho Irreconcilable freo traders among the Unionists and will not daro risk wreaking the Government for the sao of their theories at least as lone as Mr Gladstone stands ready to topple thorn over and march triumphantly into powor at tho frt oppor tunity Tho dread of tho Grand Old Man is tho powerful cement which is binding together In a fairly substantial looking wholo some very incongruous material The curious feature of tho controversy Is that it is bringing to tho public gaze a comical collection of political fossils Mr James Lowthor for Instance who for a brief pro bold tho ofHoo of Irish Secre tary but lost his sat i the general election of 1885 and had not since bon heard of spoke at a public meeting in London the other day Mr Lowther Long Jimmy the Irish members used to call him in the old fighting days de nounced in scornful terms Mr Chaplins advice to In for bimetallism Mr Lowthor go blmotalsm Lowhor wants a sliding scale of duties on cereals and other things and ho moans to got i as soon a home rule and Mr Gladstone aro out of the way A still more venerable fossil appeared at the same meeting in tho person of the Duko of Rutland a great territorial magnate but who has s little brains that with the advantages of enormous wealth on his side ho is almost a political nobcdy while his poor younger brother Lord John Manners I a member of the Cabinet and one of the most respected public men In this country His Grace took merc for his text but as h speech car fully road from manuscript had bon prepared previous t tho publication of President Clove lands meSBacelt read somewhat oddly after a the world had read that message but vrhlchthoJnk evidently knew nothing Up td tho present the Cobden Club which was founded t protect fro trade and combat fiscal herosle1 bos made no move against this de velppment of tho protectionist agitation I is a very wealthy organization but it has no club house and its operations are confined as a rule to the circulation of free trado literature with which at irregular intervals I floods the country Every year tho Cobden Club meets in London generally at the Reform Club and the President congratulates the members on to blessed condition of this free trade coun try bewails the obstinate adherence of the United States to her bloated tariffs and an nounces how many million coplos of tracts and handbooks havo been issued during tho past year In Ireland the arrest and Imprisonment of tho enemies of coercion and tho Government coes steadily on and more members of Parliament including Mr Hooper arrested tonight havo ben put in jal At the same time tho direct le is given t the Tory assertions that an unusual state of prime exists demanding measures of unusual severity by their Governments ow Judges who on tho opening of tho winter as sizes have boon congratulating the Grand Juries on the mArkod decrease of crime Mr I Gladstone has bad very little to say this week I His health though good Is not quite so robust a usual and it is probable ho will tako the ad vice of his friends and go to Italy for a few weeks change and rest He will celebrate his 78th birthday the 29th Inst and the bihday on Inst proposal posal has been mae to give him a gigantic birthday present In the shape of sev eral hundred thousand pennies to b subscribed by the Irish and English worklngmen the maximum individual sub scription being fixed at one penny It is un derstood however that Mr Gladstone does not view this idea with favor and it will proba Uy be abandoned in favor of a moro convivial suggestion to tho effect thnt members of tho Liberal and Radical Clubs and associations In Great Britain and of the Innumerable branches of the National League in Ireland shall assem ble on the evening of tho 29th and at an hour to b fixed beforehand simultaneously drink the health of the Grand Old Man or sing For

I Unionists there is an element of discord Zion trivial but moro amusing than that Bong tho Tories There are discord potty dislikes and jealousies between the two Ide rale Mugwumps Whig and Radical of the antihome On the Continent there Is a war scare In full bloom which may be called the regular fall war scare It f duo principally to the Christ i dulnesa which spurs writers to manic Untero feats of magnifying and partly to tho Mrait efforts of a large number gentlemen Who expecting from the French elections trou ble which did not bears come are now beal on many Continental securities and feel the necessity doing something Austria and Russia era Watching each other carefully and Germany feeling that tho election of Carnot has le creased danger from the direction of the Rhine may as is asserted have been piling UP moro OMUrt In the direction of Russia Hut this f witath regular course of ewiU and while matter easy mi aggravated and war burst out a aimort any Um ao A U the xawpeot o 4 i t j i a fight Is quits as remote as It has boon at any time for months back and In fact rather moro BO Carnot Is mild and does not want war Bismarck nnd tho Czar havo agreed to hate the Orleanlsts who trickodthem OrlelnlBt trckod them with forgeries nnd to pretend at least to b friends Austria ixs usual is worried at tho prospect of cordiality between Russia nnd Germany but Austria is not going to undertake to fight any body unless she has to without having lots of friends behind her The war scare will prob ably last however and continue t thrive for with almost every nation hating and mistrust ing somo other one It is not difficult to find facts thnt mako war crobnblo War Is prob able and It is a wonder that It doos not break out somowhoro only there Is no good reason for giving peacefully Inclined folk an extra i fright at this particular moment I In Paris whore I spent the first half of the eok tho spirit of gladness reigns which char acterizes a small boy who has had a tooth pulled without the agonies for which he bad braced himself All sorts of rows wore ex pected and nothing has happened To those who judge from the surface It Is incompre hensible that the monarchists should have de voted their strength t tho hopeless task of electing Gon Baussior when they might have elected Ferry and have helped their cause by sowing discord In the republic But the fat is the royalists did not try to elect Baussior They determined before the first ballot as I cabled you from the Versailles Congress to give Carnot secretly as many votes ns ho might noed and It was only on the second ba lot when tho withdrawal of Ferry and Bo Frey olnot made Carnots election 1 certainty that the royalists concluded to indulge their tle ryalt concuded own tasto and voto on principle for Baussior against the Republican favorite Tho task undertaken by Carnot and by Falllleres who Is working hard for him to unite all branches of tho Re publican party In an eclectic ministry may succeed and go along with apparent smooth ness for a while but it is bound to end In ultimate disaster Tho attempt to reconcile the extreme Loft and the Con servative Republicans is n absurd an undertaking as would be in America that of forming an harmonious organization of pro hibitionists and saloon keepers or of the Chouncoy Dcpows and John Hosts They I would not work well together When this present lovefeast stato of things wears oft In Franco discord will soring up again Such is the hope of tho Royalists who arc just now completely eclipsed and they will probably not I bo disappointed especially as tho loaders of the revolutionary clement are preparing to console themselves for their disappointment at not having the glorious row which they expect ed Ferrys election t stir up for them Tho shooting of Ferry today did not hurt him much In another sense the Incident will great ly help him as he had sunk Into obscurity and this affair Is likely to make of him a very big man and will do much to turn popular feeling in his favor which ho needs tremendously Americans In Paris ore leaving by thousands but Mr Blame with his wife and daughter are still there and are having a good time Their only trouble is to choose between their many Invitations Blame still proves himself a mag netic man and walks without any trouble Into the hearts of all the French folk he meets that Is I they speak any English at all for Mr Blame doos not speak French The most striking thing about tho man is the wonderful Improvement In his health It astonishes all who saw him in the early part of his trip His face had a look of dreadful pallor which made it almost unpleasant His voice has regained all Its strength and Is used most of the time in telling funny stories which proves h cheerful state of mind friend mldAffend writes me that his cheerfulness has even In creased since the publication Clevelands message The Danes are waiting to know of tho intended movements ot

They will proba bly remain In Paris until Christmas An amusing story Is being whispered about in Paris salons which gives a good insight into a certain phase of Paris life and explains the Budden

has been sent to hunt tiger In India and society Is asking whether tho Com to sse will go and hunt him while ho hunts tiger and I so what members of the Orleans family will join In tho chase Society
