In rJIs pamphlet entitled "Income Tax Explained"' It Is made to appear that tjic rate of tax Imposed by the State lpcomc tax law Is "one per centum of net Incomes In excels of $10,000." Tlie itrluter wickedly omitted n "not" be tween "incomes" nnd "in,'' the fact be ing that I pcrccnL tnx is levied on all Incomes under $10,000, with the same exemptions which are gjven under the Hedern! Income tax law. un net in epmcs between $10,000 nnd $50,000 the tax Is 2 per cent.; nbove $50,000 the tax Is 3 per cent. It would be pleasant if tho types were right as the State Printer set liicro. It would bring from 10 cents to $00 worth of cheer, at the right sea son, into the hearts of New York men and women. If Incomes under $10,000 were exempt Mr. Travis would collect from perhaps 50,000 persons Instead of tho 750,000 who he exacts will pay tho new tax.

The war time prohibition act was. a part of tho Emergency Agricultural Appropriation bill, nnd Its Intention was to conservo food, fuel nnd man power until after tho demobilization of tho army. It was passed by Con gress on November 18, 1918, a week after the armistice, and was signed by the President on November 21, but It was not effective until July 1, 1919, when, under Its provisions, the manufacture, Importation and sale of Intoxicating liquors were to deaso tin til after the end of the war nnd tho demobilization of the army, this time to be determined by Presidential proc lamation. On May 20, 1919, before tho law went Intq effect, Mr. Wilson recom mended that Congress repeal it Thli was not done. On October 15 Congress passed the Volstead bill, which was aimed chlolly nt the enforcement of prohibition tin der tho Eighteenth Amendment, but which also declnred that for the pur .poses of the war time prohibition act nn Intoxicating beverage Is one which contains more than one-half of 1 per cent, of alcohol. On October 27 Inst President Wil son vetoed the Volstead, act because of that part of It wlUch .related to war time prohibition. He said: "I object to and cannot approve that part of this legislation with ref erence to n-ar time prohibition. It has to do with tho enforcement of an act which was passed by reason of tho emergencies of tho war and whcae objects have been satisfied In the demobilization of the army ana : navy and whose repeal I have nl-' ready sought at tha hands of Can greaa." On October 27 the House nnd on October 28 the Senate passed the Volstead bill over the President's veto and the measure Immediately be- fame a law. It was not the Volstead law which was under scrutiny In the Supremo Court of the United State but the act of November 21, 1018 the act which manifestly will continue to op- rate, unless tho President ehould pro claim the end of tho war, until con stltutlonaj, prohibition transcends nil other liquor legislation. One month fronvto-day that greater thorn In the side of Bacchus, tho pro hlbltlon amendment, will go Into effect.- Meanwhile, this winter air Is like wine. La Follette's Misstatement About Government Railroad Losses. With all the political capers "he cuts whon ho discusses a publlr-'qucstlun Ju the Semite BonEirr M. La Folletti: has enough natural ability und is suf ficiently master of plain arithmetic to know what Government operation of the rnllroads is draining out of the United Stutcs Treasury and thus cost ing American taxpayers nbove nnd be yond the billion of dollars tt year of in creased tramc bills they are paying. When lie dechired, therefore, on the floor of the Senate that the Govern mont was now making money out of Its operation of the railroads he must have known that ho was stating as a fact something that was not a fact He must have known that lu thts ycn.r of 1010 there has never been n month when the Government has earned tho rentals It pays the roads. Ho must have known that If the Government should continue to operate tho roads for the first six mouths of 1020 It would not earn the rentals payable In that period by tens and hundreds of millions of dollar.-.

Net operating income was $70,307,213, as against $102,700, 478 In 1017. As the October rental In the Gov- ornriient contract Is $04,333,000, there Is no more doubt that with only $70, - 000,000 of net operating Income tho Treasury went behind on tho opera- tlon of that month than there Is that It wenj behind In Fcbrunry, when the rental was $47,034,000 nnd the opernt Ing Income was $10,100,200; or In March, when tho rental waa $08,251,- 000 and the operating incomo was $10,812,008. The summer nnd autumn months nro always for railroads the bit; earn ing months. The winter and spring months aro always the poor canting months. Hut Government ojieratlon could not get out whole for the Treas ury oven In tho big earning months. And It is a dead certainty that if the Government is operating '.lie loath after the turn of the year Its los-scs will bo not merely millions a month, as In August, September and October, but tens of millions a month. Senator L. Foli.ette Is entitled to his own opinion ns to tho desirability of Government ownership anil oper- tlon.

Aleiander Workman In Fear of Death. In his argument to save his client from deportation to Ittissln counsel for the anarchist Bkrkman sought to wlu the sympathy of tho Supremo Court by asserting that to send him to "the White Guard country of Itus- sla would bo equivalent to a death Kontcnce."V His client should look courageously on death. It was ho who In further ance of the anarchist movement shot iml stabbed IIckr-y C. FniCK. Since his release from prison he has beeu teaching anarchy, preaching anarchy. urging anarchy. In a manner craftily calculated to cause other men to mur der men, women and children; to use the pistol, knife and bomb against isolated Individuals nnd ngnlitst indi viduals gathered together In com pany ; to start panics In which per sons obeying tho law nnd conducting themselves In an orderly manner should loe their lives. Hebkman mav have done this with caution cunningly refraining front any word or act which might bring prosecution on him, may have established a per feet alibi in every particular case of lolence resulting from his teachings. but the general effect of his teachings he must have known. Iu court he mav have been able to present a clean record, but a public familiar with .the story of thu man who urged, .a mob not to nail another's ear to (he pump will make no mistake about his i'i-ral responsibility. Consequently Bkhkman, whining that ho may executed In the coun try to which he Is going for this country's good.

Like the son of a man who, having lived In utllucnee, dies and leaves his family In dire want Austria has taken the treasures of nrt accumulated In days of prosperity to the pawnshop; to offer thciu as security for food. She docs not seek money for perma nent Improvements, to create an army. to build a navy, to improve high ways, but food to keep her famishing people from literal starvation food for babies and women, food for young, robust men who can't work because Austria has no raw mutcrnls for them to work on. What nro tho nations which can help Austria going to do? What k America, with Its granaries bursting with provender, going to do? Is Aus tria to be treated as the patron of the pawnshop Is treated? Is she to bo told "on this ancient painting yon can havo so many bushels ot wheat: wo'll let you have so much bacon on this piece of hand wrought silver; this antique statue will brlnsj you so many cans of condensed milk; and when thnt Is gono you must bring around some moro collateral or else your peo ple can Ptarvc"? Is rmcrica going to say to Aus tria "Wo shall give you food cost ing exactly what w-c think the col lateral you can put up is wnith"? Suppose Austria hocks, sells,' sur renders her art treasures for food, and her people, having eaten the food, are again hungry; Is this nation going to tell them that hecauso they have nol moro pnlntlngs nnd Jewels and mosaics to hock or sell they may starve and keep still whllo they suf fer? Is America, rich In food be yond tho possibility of consumption, going to say ": ton of wheat for a gold candlestick; no candlestick, no wheat, and kindly don't die on the doorstep"? One nation Is not going to damn Us soul with such cynical bargaining; one hind In generous humanity has already forgotten the cent. er cent of the three golden balls.

To tub Editor or Tub Sun flir: I received a day or two o a letter from the Mayor of Dony, France, describing a ptltrrlmage made by the inhabitants cf that town to the American cemetery, where lie tho bodies of our dead, l,t0 In number, who sacrificed their lives In tho assault upon tho Hlndenburg line In tho vicinity of Bony September 27 to 30, 1918. Tho sentiments contained In this letter forcibly ehow the rovortneo hold by tho French people for the mem ory of those who mado such rrefrt sncrl flcoa to aid them In their !!grht for their existence. It demonstrates conclusively tho effect upon the people of France of the presence of those white crosses marking tho craves Irl their midst of the Americans who died for tliom. Could thore possibly bo conceived any moro certnln safeguard against unpleas ant relations In the future botween France and America than these ullent but re- mindful crosses? Lylnc where they do, even tne monai remains 01 im-eu euiuicib continue to servo their country. Do those who urge the deportation of these bodlod from Franco and their dispersion In America contemplate the results of what they propose7 Everything was dona that could be done at the time when the evidence waa fresh to Identify and Inter tho remains of our dead.. The work of recofrnltlon and burial bogan under firo and before tho battle waa ended. To attempt" now to remove and dlfperac them would Involve not only great ex pense but would carry with it many dif ficulties anJ regrettable Incidents. Many men were badly mangled and shattered when struck by bursting Bhells. The bodies of others who were killed by bullets were later mangled by shell fire. Before leaving France I caused to be recorded an expression of sentiment In each company of the regiments of tho division, and the sentiment waa almost wholly In favor of leaving tho bodies In ranee, for It was then recognized that their later removal and reinterment In America In addition to Involving Infinite dllllcultlcs would reopen the wounds of sorrow occasioned by these locses. 1 have made It a point to question parents who have loat their sons In battle, and I find that with a vcrj(ew exceptions they Ither prefer that the bodies be permitted to He In our own cemeteries In Franca or they ore willing to be guided by tho sol dier sentiment In relation to the matter. Undoubtedly the action of Conprcs3 In providing for tho removal of thn dead was actuated by m'.lves of kindly senti ment, but it appo.tis to hnve been hasty ctlon adopted shortly after the armis tice and before the sentiment of the sol diers could have been known. With a knowledge of nil the condi tions, I hope that a Ftrong sentiment will deve'op among tho families of the dead protesting against what seems to me al most a sacrilege tho removal of tho bodies of our gallant men from those sacred sites In Franco where they died together and which wilt boeome places of pilgrimage for the honoring of their memory. john r. u iitan, Major-General. New York, December 15. WHAT'S "IN THE SERVICE"? Tho Pnzrl of a Soldier Who Was De prived of Longevity Pay. To the Editor of Tun St'.v Sir: What would some of the men of the American Legion think If told they bad not been In the service of the United States although they were overseas and In somo of the big engagements? Here is a case In point) A first ser geant In tho New Jersey National Guard with more thnn five years service to his credit went to Fort Myer, Va.. In May, 1917. He Was commissioned n Second Lieutenant In August, 1917, and sent to a Southern camp to train n lot of drafted men. He waa paid longevity pay for lid previous services the same as many me-i1 men. v Tho Comptroller of the Treasury makes a decision to this effect : 'The acceptance of a commission in some other branch of the army after entrance Into tho National Guard hy way of draft taki-a away the drafted status. thereby extinguishing the right to lon gevity pay, which Is made to accompany tho drafted status by section 111 of the act of June 3, 1916. To put It moro tlmrly and make the contrast of the language of this said section more ap parent, an officer who after being draft ed Into the service of the United States accepts a commission In the Officers Ile serve Corps or In tho Regular Arm' is no longer 'In the service of tho United States' under the terms of this section and therefore Is not entitled to tho privileges of those who come within tho terms of the section." Since the man In question enlisted vol untarlly In tho National Guard five yean before tho United States entered tlie war should he be regarded as In the "draft ed" class? Guard fcrvlco and commissioned in the Uesorvo Corps or In tho ltegular Army and then assigned to any branch of tho sorvlce how can that he hold against his longevity record when, as is generally known, he has no choice as to tho ac ceptanci) of the commission hut is ex pected to obey orders? If a man who went overseas and par ticipated In some of the major engage ments was not "In tho service of the United States" then In what service was he engaged? If men formerly In the National Guard, commissioned to other branches of the service nnd held in this coun try In various capacities, were pMd longevity pay becausa of former National Guard service then why should not a man who risked hli Hfo abroad also re ceive It. and hnvlng received It Is there any Justice In asking him to return ap portion of tho money oncts paid to him? If tho Comptroller makes n decision that Is manifestly unfair and discrimi natory Is there no way In which It may be overruled and Justice be accorded to the men affected by such a decision? C. S.

EDDIE 'GRANT REMEMBERED There 'Will Bo a Memorial to a Hero of San Field and Ilattlo Field. To the Editor or The Son Sir: In Titu SUM of December 12 I note a letter signed "Fan" regarding "Baseball's Lost Star." Tho movement to erect a memo- tial to Eddie Grant has not been glvonj up and far from It, Unfortunately those who have It in charge have bech widely scattered all summer and prog ress has been delayed. J. J. McOraw Is president ot the Eddie Grant Memorial Association and Snm Crane Of the rrenlno- Journal Is secre tary. Tlie commltteo In charge la com posed of newspaper writers all of whom were personal friends of Eddie Grant. I have the honcr of being treasurer and have u fund on hand, not very largo but a fairly good ft.irt, and if there are any friends of EJdle Grant who wish to con tribute to that fund any amount they please I shall bo only too glad to ro eelve tt. ills own company In tho 307th Regi ment has contributed, as well as officers who were with him In' France. Tht committee to which I referred will have charge of the "election of a design and also the placlnj of the memorial. Per sonally I think the Polo Grounds would be a At placj. as he was very fond ot Nt-w York city and the New York playera were very fond of him. I am sure that no one knew better than tho writer his "zeal, ability and conduct on tho field" to which "Fan' relets. If the public could only hear pome of tho praises which I have hoard from Eddie GtHnt'8 fellow soldiers It would be rcalued that ho was not only a fighter on the ball field and battle field but ono of the mast lovable men that another mf.n could know.

STABILIZING THE DOLLAR. An Amendment SnggCsted to Profes sor Fisher's Fropoinl, To the Editor or The sun Sir: One gets acctmtornod to startling propositions as tho tweniicin cemury wuu. voting ago. but the reform proposed by Professor Irving Fisher, the Yale expert on economics, at a recent luncheon in Brooklvn seems by all odds the mort revolutionary of any put forth since Pro crustes undertook to standardize tho stature of men. lie says, according to a report which arrears not In an avowedly humorous publication but In the dally newspapers, that a siaDio uounr d,,uu, w equivalent In valua to a certain amount of commodities." It should! It should! The Iton. William J. Brennlnga proved that long ago. But how can It bo done? Profosaor Fisher tolls us. Ho fays! "Tho gold dollar la now Hxcd In weight and thcrcforo variable In purchasing power. A gold dollar fixed In purchas ing power, and therefore! varlabto In welsht, wou'.l solve; the problem." Simple and evident. In this age when the time of day Is fixed by legislative enactment regardless of solar or sidereal conditions and clocks nro set and roset to conform with the statute. It ought to be easy for Congress to determine each day how much the gold dollar weighs, regardless of the smlos, and thus make It "equivalent In valuo to a certain amount of commodities." This' would be easier than to vary the ! actual weight of the gold dollar each day to accord with tho varying values 0( certain commodities, nnd would of f0Urse achieve the same tcsult. Some , . Wi8atlon might he found ncces- sary to prevent the fluctuation In the values of commodities oftener than once n day, but legislation Is now admittedly adequate to the regulation of anything and everything. Was Professor Fisher talking throush his hat or was his tongue In bin cheek? David a. CcnTts. Nr.w Tor.K. December 13. The. Hint. Mr. Ks!ekr Wat! would yni :iv rvt Christmas?

Women Voters Aro Given ns Twofold. A. Tt n-hA Kwiffi-ni suffrage amendment will be ratified by tho nocessary thirty-six States not later than February i ncu Thl uredlction was' mado yesteruay by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt. president of tho National Woman Suffrage Asso- elation, .recently returned from a tour of tho Western state-. It means. If Mrs. Catt'n prediction Is to be ruinueu. .w h fourteen State Legislatures. either In special or regular session, will ratify the Federal amendment giwng nationwide suffrage to the women of America by tho end of next month. It will also, Sirs. Catt says, establish i a record In the matter of time Mcwaary to ratify a popular constitutional amond- m '"it baa been a record of "ni"0 progreas." Mrs. Catt said. "Thft",cmlf; nent was submlfted on Juno 4 -mm, iv wnr ah e only to eaten the declining days of tho regular slons of many of the State Legislatures. H took the prohibition amendment a ,i mm,n, Worn It was ratified, and some popular nmendmcnta have taken as lon as four yenrs. "However, thoro has novcr been an .. e tinv,tlnn. It haa been a mat ter of time only. And for this reason tho outlook Is now particularly pleasing. HIM.. tlin ItlArnn tinnal suffrage or- ganlratlon meets In congress In Madrid n.o, tn Anrll we hone our dele gate will be able to go on record as representing a nation that has On shed Us task. It Is noteworthy that those Include some of tho nations with whom we have been at war particularly Ger many, which haR given her women the vAin nut .with tho outlook for ratifica tion In this country by February so bright. It Is unlikely that the American delegates to the congress In Madrid win bef put to the humiliating position of being-told by the German representatives, "We have beaten you nt your own game of democracy." , . Mr. Catt was enthusiastic ycBtcrda about the resultB ot her c.-nern iniJ. Tho trln was undertakon," sho ox nlnln.-d. "because our orgamantlon waa imnhli. to understand why the Governors fof somo of tho States which we know to be for suffrage were lukewarm to me suggestion of calling special Besslons of their respective Legislatures for purposes of ratification. States that we expected to lend off In tho matter were content to assure us that they wouid finish tho Job. Wo wore unnblo to understand why except to rt-alUa that certain local problems may have stood n tno wu), There were three States In particular- South Dakotn. Oreeon and New Mexico over which wo were troubled nnd whoso Governors would give us no prom ise In respect to calling a special ces sion. However. 1 am glad to bo .able to say that South Dakota Iioh since caiieii a aneclal session and ratified : a special session haa been called for next month In Oregon and the Governor ot New Moxlco has promised tC call n special session Just as soon as he cun fix up soino vncanclen in tho Legis'iuure. "Other Governors have given us np pittances that special sessions will bo called but have naked that no public an nouncement of the fact bo made at tnia time. The reason .for that request la that the executives with to maintain control of tho dates .and certain prob - lems particularly Irrigation In flln Western States may DC im-iuueu in inu mesage calling special sessions. Mrs. Catt said that comp ote ratlflca- tlon should be effected befoto Februnry 1 on account of tho forthcoming spring primaries in some of th , fltile. i "Some of the States." Mrs. Catt added, in which spring primaries are held already havo given the women the vota. but in others. liec-nUfM of the failure of the Legislatures to meet, tho adoption of the Federal amendment will be neces vary. We think It is only fair that tho women of every State will havo tho I right to voto nt the spring primaries, wherever they are held." Mis: Catt was Induced to add some- thing to what she has already said about tho League ot women votcr tno or- ganlratlon that all aspiring politicians aro regarding with mingled feelings of concern, respect or disdain, according to the Individual's attitude ani record on the suffrage question. Vhcn asked to explain briefly the pur pose of the so-called International league in words tlia' would repel sug gestions that it was at e an organi zation with extreme radical tendencies, Mrs. Catt replied: "Tho solo purpose of tho International organization la to secure eiuffrago for the women ot tho civilized world." To a similar question In regird to the national organization, which Is noon to absorb tlve National American Women Suffrage Association that Is, when the thirty-sixth State has ratified, or im soon thereafter aa practicable, Mrs. Catt to piled : "Tho purpose of the National League of Womon Voters in twofold: First, to securo legislation that will removo dis crimination against women undoi the evory.hcro" t0 tho enfranchisement of inv anil second, to remove oosincies women, "Tho League, however, will not confine Its attention and consideration to nut ters solely concerning tho women. The men aro equally Interested in such prob lems ns better elt-ctlon methods, com batting Illiteracy, provision of higher standards of naturalization nnd so on In other words, the women are taking their enfranchisement seriously nnd In a way the men never paused to edu cate their voters to do." Mrs. Cntt wild that slnco the last In ternational congrcfis of sulfrago organl-. antlons In 1913 In Buda Pest, flvo ad ditional countries had been added to tho original twenty-six that made up the membership. Tlicso nro Argentina, Nicaragua, t'ruguay, Cuba and Spain. Each of the now thlrty-ono members has been Invited to send thlrtoen delegates one solectod by the cxecutlvo bend of tho nation nnd tho other twelve by tho national suffrage organization to tho congress, which opens In Madrid tho flrft week In April. In addition, Mrs. Catt said, the Ar gentina organization had Invltisl the American organization to send delegates to a great Pan-American suffrage con gress In Buenos Aires In 1921, nnd l iiivltatlon has been accepted.
