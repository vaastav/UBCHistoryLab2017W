Prohibit Vahealthjr Competition. "Among the points to be aimed at should be the prohibition of unhealthy competition, such as by rendering serv ice at an actual loss for the purpose of crushing out competition, the prevention of inflation of capital, and the prohibi tion of a corporation's making exclusive trade with Itself a condition of having any trade with itself. Reasonable agree ments between, or combinations of, cor porations should be permitted, provided they are first submitted to and approved by some appropriate government body. The congress has the power to charter corporations to engage In interstate and foreign commerce, and a general law can be enacted under the provisions of which existing corporations could take out federal charters and new federal corporations could be created. An es sential provision of such a law should bo a method of predetermining by some federal board or commission whether the applicant for a federal charter was an association or combination within the re strictions of the federal law. Provision should also be made for complete pub licity in. all matters affecting, the public and complete protection to the Investing public and tho shareholders in the mat ter of Issuing corporate securities. If an incorporation law Is not deemed advisa ble. a license act for big interstate cor porations might be enacted or a com bination of the two might he tried. The supervision established might be analo gous to that now exercised over national banks. At least, the anti-trust act should be supplemented by snecllic pro hibitions of the methods which experi ence has shown have been of most serv ice in enabling monopolistic combinations to crush out competition. The real own ers of a corporation should be compelled to do business In their own name. "To confer upon the national govern ment. in connection with the amendment I advocate in the anti-trust law, power of supervision over big business concerns engaged in interstate commerce would benefit them as it has benefited the na tional banks. In the recent business crisis it is noteworthy that the Institu tions which failed were Institutions which were not under the supervision and con trol of the national government. Those which were under national control stood tl:c test. Would Benefit All. "National control of the kind advocated would be to the benefit of every well managed railway. From the standpoint of the public there Is need for additional tracks, additional terminals and Improve ments in the actual handling of the rail roads. and all this as rapidly as possible. Ample, safe and speedy transportation facilities are even more necessary than cheap transportation. Therefore there is need for the investment of money whicli will provide for all these things, while at the same time securing, as far as pos sible, better wages and shorter hours for their employes. Therefore, while there must be just and reasonable regulation of rates, we should be the first to protest against any arbitrary and unthinking movement to cut them down without th-» fullest and most careful consideration of all interests concerned and of the actual needs of the situation. Only a special body of men acting for the national gov ernment. under authority conferred upon it by the congress is competent to pass judgment on such a matter. "Those who fear, from any reason, the extension of federal activity will do well to study the history not only of the na tional banking act but of the pure food law, and notably the meat inspection law recently enacted. The pure food law was opposed so violently that its passage was delayed for a decade, yet it has worked unmixed and immediate good The meat inspection law was even more violently assailed. Two years have not elapsed, and already It has become evi dent that the great benefit the law con fers upon the public is accompanied bv an equal benefit to the reputable packing establishments. The latter are better oft under the law than they were without it. The benefit to interstate common carriers and business concerns from the legisla tion I advocate would be equally mark ed." Pnre Food Law. "Incidentally in the passage of the pure food law the action of the various state food and dairy commissioners show ed In striking fashion how much good for the whole people results from the hearty co-operation of the federal and state of ficials In securing a given reform. It !s primarily to the action of these state commissioners that we owe the enact ment of this law, for they aroused the people, first to demand the enactment and enforcement of state laws on the sub ject, and then the enactment of the fed eral law, without which the state law* were largely ineffective. There must oe the closest co-operation between the na tional and state governments in admin istering these laws." Currency I.aw*. The president again calls attention to the condition of our currency laws and urges on congress the need of Immediate attention to this matter. He savs: "We need a greater elasticity in our currency: provided, of course, that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always ha the most rigid examination by the na tional authorities. Provision should be made for an emergency currency. The emergency issue should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully prescribed by the "overnment. Such emergency issue must be based on adequate securities ap proved by the government, and must be issued under a heavy tax. This would permit currency being issued when the demand for it was urgent.- while secur ing its retirement as the demand fell off. It is worth investigating to determine whether officers and directors of national banks should ever he allowed to loan to themselves.- Trust companies should be subject to the same supervision as banks legislation to this effect should be enacted for the District of Columbia and the ter ritories. "Yet we must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the subject can only accomplish a certain amount. No legislation can by any possibility guar antee the business community against the results of speculative folly any more than It can guarantee an Individual against the results of his extravagance." The income account of the nation is ln a most satisfactory condition. Neverthe less. the president says, there Is an evi dent and constantly growing feeling among our people that the time Is rap Idly approaching when our system of revenue legislation must be revised. The Tariff. "This country Is definitely committed to the protective system and any effort to uproot It could not but cause widespread industrial disaster. In other words, the principle of the present tariff law could not with wisdom be changed. But in a country of such phenomenal growth as ours it is probably well that every dozen years or so the tariff laws should be carefully scrutinized so as to see that no excessive or improper benefits are con ferred thereby, that proper revenue Is provided, and that our foreign trade is encouraged. There must always be as a minimum a tariff which will not only al low for the collection of an ample rev enue but which will at least make good the difference In cost of production here and abroad. The question should be approached purely from a business standpoint: both the time and the manner of the change being such as to arouse the minimum of agitation and disturbance in the business world, and to give the least play for sel fish and factional motives. The sole con sideration should be to see that the sum total of changes represents the public good. This means that the subject can not with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding a presidential election, because as a matter of fact experience has conclusively shown that at such a time it is Impossible to get men to treat it from the standpoint of the public good In my judgment the wise time to deal with the matter Is Immediately after such election." Income Ts* and Inheritance Tax. "When our tax laws are revised the question of an income tax and an inher itance tax should receive the careful at tention of our legislators. In my judg ment both of these taxes should be part of our svstem of federal taxation." Compulsory Investigation of Indus trial Disputes. "Strikes nnd lockouts, with their at tendant loss and suffering, continue to decrease. For the five years ending Dec. .U, the number of strikes was greater than those In any previous ten years and was double the' number in the preceding five years. These figures in dicate tho increas'ng need of providing some machinery to deal with tills class of disturbances in the interest alike of the employer, tho employe, and the gen eral public. I renew my previous rec ommendation that the congress favorably consider the matter of creating the ma chlnerv for compulsory Investigation of such industrial controversies as are of sufficient magnitude and of sufficient con cern to the people of the country as a whole to warrant the federal government in taking action." National Inspection of Grain. "The grain producing industry of the countrv. one of the most Important in the United States, deserves special con sideration at the hands of congress. Our grain Is sold almost exclusively by grades. To secure satisfactory results In our home markets and to facilitate our trade abroad, these grades should approximate the' highest degree aa win of uni­ formity and certainty. The present di verse methods of inspection and grading throughout the country under different laws and boards .result in confusion and lack of uniformity, destroying that con fidence which Is necessary for healthful trade. Complaints against the present methods have continued for years and they are growing In volume and In tensity, not only In this country but abroad. I therefore suggest to the con gress tho advisability of a national sys tem of inspection and grading of. grain entering Into Interstate and foreign com merce a remedy for the present evils." Inland Waterway*. "The conservation of our natural re sources and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem which underlies almost every other problem of our na tional life. We must maintain for our civilization the adequate material basis without which that civilization cannot exist. We must show foresight, we must look ahead. As* a nation we not only en joy a wonderful measure of present pros perity but if this prosperity Is used alight It is an earnest of future success such as no other nation will have. The reward of foresight for this nation Is great and easily foretold. But there must be the look ahead, there must be a realisation of the fact that to waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and exhaust the land Instead of using it so as to In crease its usefulness, will result in un dermining in the days of our children the very prosperity which we ought bv right to hand down to them amplified and developed. For the last few years, through several agencies, the government has heen endeavoring to get our -people to look ahead and to substitute a planned and orderly development of our resources ln olace of a haphazard striving for im mediate profit. Our great river systems should be developed as national water highways: the Mississippi, with Its trib utaries. standing first in importance, nnd the Columbia second, although there are manv others of Importance on the Pa cific. the Atlantic and the gulf slopes. Tile national government should under take this work, and I hope a beglnnin? will be made in the present congress: and the greatest of all our rivers, the Missis sippi. should receive especial attention. From the Great lAkej to the mouth of the Mississippi there should be a deep waterway, with deep waterways leading from it to tho ~~st and the West. Such a waterway would practically mean the extension of our coast line Into the verv heart of our country. It would be of In calculable benefit to our people. If be gun at once it can be carried through in lime appreciably to relieve the congestion of our great freight carrying lines of railroads. The work should be sys tematically and continuously carried for ward in accordance with some well-con ceived plan. "I h"ve appointed an inland waterways commission to study and outline a com prehensive scheme of development along wll the lines indicited. Later I shall lav Its report before the congress." Reclamation work. "Irrigation should be far ore ex clusively developed than at present not only in the states of the great plains and the Rocky mountains but tn many other« as, tor instance. In large portions of the South Atlantic and Gulf States, where it should go hand in hand with the rec lamation of swamp land. The work of he reclamation service in developing th» larger opportunities of the western half of our country for irrigation is more im portant than almost any other movement. The constant purpose of the government connection with the reclamation serv ice lias been to use the water resources of the public lands for the ultimate great est good of the greatest number In other words, to put upon the land permanent homemakers, to use and develop It for themselves and for their children and children's children." Forestry. On the subject of forestry the presi dent says: "We are prone to speak of the resources of this country as inexhaustible this Is not so. The mineral wealth of the coun try, the coal, iron, oil, gas and the like, does not reproduce itself, and therefore is certain to be exhausted ultimately, and wastefulness in dealing with it to-day means that our descendants will feel tho exhaustion a generation or two before they otherwise would. But there are cer tain other forms of waste which could be entirely stopped—the waste of soil by washing, for instance, which is among the most dangerous of all wastes now in progress in the United States, is easily preventable, so that this present enormous loss of fertility is entirely unnecessary. The preservation or replacement of the forests is one of the most important means of preventing this loss. We have made a beginning in forest preservation, but it is only a beginning. "Every business man in the land, every writer in the newspapers, every man or woman of an ordinary school education, ought to be able to see that immense quantities of timber are used in the country, that the forests which supply this timber are rapidly being exhausted and that, if.no change takes place, ex haustion come comparatively soon, and that the effects of it will be felt se verely In the every-day life of our peo ple. Surely when these facts are so ob vious there should be no delay In tak ing preventive measures. Panama Canal. "Work on the Panama canal Is pro ceeding in a highly satisfactory manner." Postal Affairs. "I commend to the favorable considera tion of the congress a postal savings bank syBtem as recommended by the post master general. The primary object is to encourage among our people economy and thrift and by the use of postal savings bank to give them an opportunity to hus band their resources, particularly those who have not the facilities at hand for depositing their money in savings bank. Viewed, however, from the experience of the past few weeks, it is evident that the advantages of such an Institution are still more far-reaching. Timid depositors have withdrawn their savings for the time be ing from national banks, trust companies, and savings banks individuals have hoarded their cash and the worklngmen their earnings all of which money has been withheld and kept in hiding or in the safe deposit box to the detriment of prosperity. Through the agency of the postal savings banks such money would be restored to the channels of trade, to the mutual benefit of capital and labor. "I further commend to the congress the consideration of the postmaster general's recommendation for an extension of the parcel post, especially on the rural routes." Presidential Campaign Expenses. "Under our form of government voting is not merely a right but a duty, ana, moreover, a fundamental and necessary duty if a man is to be a good citizen. It is well to provide that corporations shall not contribute to presidential or national campaigns, and furthermore to provide for the publication of both contributions and expenditures. There is, however, al ways danger in laws of this kind, which from their very nature are difficult of enforcement the danger being lest they be obeyed only by the honest, and dis obeyed by the unscrupulous, so aB to act only as a penalty upon honest men. The need for coilectlnc"large campaign funds would vanish if congress provided an ap propriation for the proper and legitimate expenses of each of the great national parties, an appropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thorough or ganization and'machinery, which requires a large expenditure of money. Then the stipulation should be made that no party receiving campaign funds from the treas ury should accept more than a fixed amount from any Individual subscriber or donor and the necessary publicity for receipts and expenditures could without difficulty be provided." The Army. Of the army the president says: "Its standard of efficiency and instruc tion is higher now than ever ln the past But it is too small. There are not enough officers and It is Impossible to secure enough enlisted men. We should main tain In peace a fairly complete skeleton of a large army. A great and long con tinued war would have to be fought by volunteers. But months would pass be fore any large body of efficient volunteers could be put in the field, and our regular army should he large enough to meet any immediate need. In particular it is essen tial that we should possess a number of extra officers trained in peace to perform efficiently the duties urgently required upon the breaking cut of war." The Navy. In the opinion of the president It would be most unwise for us to stop the up building of our navy, in view of the fact that the proposition for the limitation of armaments met with. no favor at all at the Hague conference. He says: "To build one battleship of the best and most advanced type a yea.r would barely keep our fleet uo to Its present force. This is not enough. In my judg ment. we should this year provide for four battleships. But it is Idle to build battleships unless in addition to provid ing the men, and the means for thorough training, we provide the auxiliaries for them, unless we provide docks, the coal ing stations, the colliers and supply shins that they need. We are extremely defi cient In coaling stations and docks on the Pacific, and this deficiency should not longer be permitted to exist. Plenty of torpedo boats and destroyers should be built. Both on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, fortifications of the best type should be provided for ail our greatest harbors." 400 IMS 

LOST III MIC DISASTER EXPL08I0N OF BLACK DAMP CAUSES AWFUL CATASTRO* PHE IN COAL MINES. ai.ii ENTRY PILED HIGH WITH DEAD RESCUER8 WORK TILL EXHAUST­ ED—NO HOPE THAT ANY WILL BE FOUND ALIVE. Monongah. W. Va., Dec. 8.—That no less than 400 miners were killed by an explosion of black damp, known to scientists as methane, in mines Nos. 6 and 8 of the Consolidation Coal com pany of Baltimore at this place yester day is now conceded by those who take the most hopeful and most con servative view of the disaster. Many Bodies Found. Of these victims six dead bodies bad been taken from Mine No. 6 at midnight last night and 65 others were piled up in the entry awaiting completion of facilities for bringing them to the surface. From Mine No. 8 at the same hour fourteen bodies bad been removed and a number of others are ready to be brought out as soon as arrangements can be com pleted. Five rescuing parties, with ten men to each party, are working at different parts of the two mines. 400 Lives Lost. Clarence W. Watson of Baltimore, president of the Consolidation Coal company, after conferring with the mine superintndent and other local representatives of the company, said there was no doubt but that 400 lives had been lost. 'While nothing definite is known at this time," said President Watson, "to Judge from the small-volume of smoke It is evident that the diaster was caused by the explosion of dust, which was probably ignited by a pocket of gas or a blowout shot." Explosion Was Terrific. The explosion occurred shortly after 10 o'clock yesterday, after the force of over 400 men had gone to work in the two mineB affected. These mineB are located on opposite sides of the West Fork river at this place, but merged in their undergrounds workings by a heading and on the surface by a big steel tipple and bridge. Evidence of the awful force of the explosion is shown in every section of the mines that has been reached by the rescuers. Huge quantities of coal and rock have beeen loosened and. hurled into every opening and all of the underground structure is completely wrecked. Work Until Exhausted. The American miners of the town were placed in charge of the relief work and the Italians and other for eigners are working under them most faithfully. The rescue forces are di vided to work in relays with frequent reliefs. Many relief parties have al ready become exhausted and sent to the surface. The scenes about the entry to the mines and about the town are pathetic and heartrending. Overwhelmed With Grief. Wives and mothers and sweethearts, together with children and members of the stronger Bex move from place to place, vainly seeking information and making no attempt to conceal the grief that overwhelms them. None Is encouraged to hope that any one in the mine has survived the explosion and the suffocating gas that Immedi ately thereafter filled the mine. Will Be investigated. Wheeling, W. Va., Dec. 8. Gov. Dawson of West Virginia, who is in Washington attending the rivers and harbors congress, left for Charleston last night And announced that he would at once institute a rigid investi gation into the causes of the disaster.
