Accidents around machinery al ways have happened and always will happen the workman must take the I risk," the average man will say re signedly, when you talk to him about the many thousands of needless in dustrlal accident that occur every year in this country. He would change his opinion could he visit the recently opened American Museum of Safety at 29 West Thirty ninth street, New York. After he has examined the many safety devices shown there designed to prevent industrial accidents, there is no hope for him and he should have his head examined by a com­ petent specialist if he still persists in saying that it can't be helped when a workman loses a hand or a leg, or any portion of His anatomy that most people like to keep. The exhibit shows clearly what can be done to prevent accidents to the working class. In many European countries museums of safety have been in existence for years, but here in the United States workmen's lives and safety have been held so cheaply that until now no effort has been ma.de to educate the people in this respect. Now the workers are. begin­ ning to wake up to the fact that they can force the employers to use safety devices and even the capitalist realizes that It is cheaper in the end to protect the liv^es of his employes. Safety for Wood Workers. As the room in which the exhibits are shown is entered, one of the. first things that is noticed is a safety de­ vice for wood working machinery. It is a circular cutter head used in hand jointers and fits closely to the table, so that even If the operator's hand slips nothing more serious than a mere gouging of the fingers results whereas in the old style machine with the square cylinder, slipping often re­ sulted in the loss o? the hand or the fingers. A picture of a hand multi lated by the old style machine Is shown and it brings the lesson home with startling vividness. This device is round in all the Ger­ man museums of safety and it is In use in upward of 5,000 shops in that country. The bulletin of the museum, which tells of its use in Germany, doesn't state why employers are com­ pelled to use it there and not in the United States, the most "advanced" nation on the face of the globe. Grinding wheels, unless correctly mounted, often burst when running at high speed and severely injure the operator. But if mounted with wide steel flanges, properly put on, they seldom go wrong, and if they do, a hood, which should be provided,, will protect the workman. The tnukuln shows three examples of unsafe wheels and also of safe ones. Absolutely Safe Scaffold., Men at work on the old style scaf­ fold are often killed or severely in­ jured by the breaking or slipping of. OIAZ MAKING SECRET TREATY WITH JAPAN WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 16. Juan Sanchez-Azcona, the member of the Mexican revolutionary commit­ tee now in the Washington district jail awaiting extradition proceedings which the Diaz government hopes will drag him back i&cross the border, has decided to lay his case before the house committee on rules which is investigating "persecutions of Mex­ ican citizens by the government of Mexico." At this hearing a most sensational charge against the Mexican govern­ ment will be made, namely, that President Diaz has sent his son to Japan to negotiate a secret treaty with that country, a treaty which I will give the Japanese government a landing stage on this continent for all I her desired military and industrial purposes. I The suicidal endeavors of Diaz to ally himself with Japan have been watched with amazement by the United States diplomats in the In ternational Bureau of American Re-

Officially there is not a flaw in our relations with Mexico, assert these wise ones, but it is pointed out that General Madero was able to get arms into Mexico without apparent trouble, while every other Mexican revolutionist of the past has found United States marshals quick t. gather in all suspicious rifles, shot Suns and revolvers that any patriotic Mexican in the United States might possess. The Political Refugee Defense league, the organization which has freed a large number of Russian and Mexican refugees from United States Jails and extradition, is actively aid­ ing Azcona, and the league's secre­ tary, now in Washington, has the promised aid of certain radical senators and representatives who brought about similar hearings of Mexican persecutions before the rules committee at the last session of con­ gress. Azcona's case is exactly similar to those in the series of arrests of po­ litical refugees in this country caused by the Mexican government after the uprising of June, 1908. Affirming that the revolutionists, who had sought an asylum in this country, were robbers and bandits, their ar­ rests for extradition* followed, and after months in jail awaiting*trial the charges of the Mexican govern­ ment were found to be absolutely without proof and the men were re­ leased. As editor of Nuevo Mexico, Safety Museum Eye Opener to the Heedles Public Ascon* the ropes that hold the apparatus. The museum shows a scaffolding that Is absolutely safe. It is provided with a railing and can be lowered or raised only by the men on it. During the three years that it has been in use, not a workman who has used it has been injured. There is a power metal punch in the operation of which it is necessary to carry the hand close to the de­ scending punch when working. The machine Is fitted with a small arm that automatically forces the hands away from the danger spot at the critical moment. Various guards for keeping the hands of operatives out of the path of saws and cogs of gears are exhibited. Hooks for pipe mill cranes are provided with outside han­ dles, so that in slipping chains over the hook, the hand runs no danger of being crushed. Many Railroad Appliances. Several safety devices for use on railroads are shown. There is a sim­ ple invention of sheet iron which may be slipped into switch frogs, which' makes it impossible to get the shoe stuck in the angle of the frog. There are signals for warning trainmen, of danger on tracks where men are working. One is a red signal target with a red lamp in its center, which is clamped upon the rail of a track down which danger lies. Even if the brakeman at the end of a train of flat cars does not see the signal, the iron flag pole, fixed to the track, will Jolt him into a realization o^ the situation. Many other exhibits are shown which should be seen to be appreciat­ ed. There are gas cocks which can­ not be accidentally opened Improved styles of life preservers safety gaso­ lene cans lamps and lanterns which if overturned will go out Immediately doors for fire exits of theaters and other public places which open auto­ matically by pressure from Inside pneumatic elevator guards which pre­ vent falling down the shaft when the elevator is not at a landing burlap screens which catch flying slivers of steel and hold them, unlike wooden partitions against which slivers often strike and rebound, injuring the work­ man safety belts for window cleaners and other devices too numerous to mention. Sanitary exhibits take up consider­ able space. All kinds of devices for preventing the spread of disease are shown. Improved apparatus for fight­ ing fires are also in evidence. Altogether the exhibit is well worth visiting. It shows concrete examples of how certain accidents take place and how they can be prevented. It driven home the lesson that it isn't the fault of the workers, in most cases, that they are horribly muti­ lated by the thousands every year. It should teach them that It is their own fault, however, that they don't force the employers, through political and industrial action, to provide safety de­ vices wherever possible, even if it does make a small cut in their precious "dividends." attacked the Diaz administration with Ihe result that his paper was sup­ pressed three times and he finally forced to fly from the country for his life. He joined the revolutionary forces of General Francisco Madero and has been in Washington for some time as a member of the resident re­ volutionary committee. The charges against him of obtaining money un­ der false pretense are as foolish as they are false because he lived four years in Mexico after the time of the alleged crime and was never either arrested or accused of anything illegal until today when his activity is objectionable to the Dictator Diaz. 

KING GEORGE HAHDS HARSH REBUFFS TO FATHER'S PARASITES In a recent letter from London the following interesting "inside" facts concerning the revolution that has re­ cently taken place In British court affairs is contained: King George Is reported to have cut Home Secretary Winston Church­ ill off the list of his acquaintances— officially as well as socially. If there is business to pass between them it must be through an intermediary. The king is understood to have told Premier Asqulth he would never see Secretary Churchill again. As a mat­ ter of legal right, Asqulth might have forced George to revoke this order, but that would have created a mighty scandal, and the king would certainly have had the sympathy of his sub­ jects in demanding that he pick his Own acquaintances. The quarrel between his majesty and Churchill is said to have arisen from the former's habit of reading over personally every state paper sub­ mitted to him to sign. Inasmuch as the home secretary must have a vast number of papers signed by the !:ing, this entailed a great loss of time. So when he laid a big batch of papers on the king's desk, Churchill re­ marked, significantly, that they were merely routine—which was true—and need not be read. George replied with a solemn rebuke for such care­ less business methods. Upon this, Churchill, whose worst enemy has never accused him of lack of confi­ dence in the infallibility of his own judgment, is said to have responded tartly that the king's business was to sign what papers his ministers laid before him, and that it really made no particular difference whether he ever read any of them. Instantly, so the gossips say, his najesty bounded out of his chair with a flow of that language he learned in his early days in the royal navy, and ordered Churchill out of the place—-ordered him to stay out, too, as long as George was on the throne. Churchill is not the only one of King Edward's favorites who has Poetically been banished from court, Moyt of them, though, saw wh*t .was THE LABOR WORLD coming and went of their own accord. Sir Ernest Cassel, Edward's Intimate and business manager, is utterly dis­ credited. Those who used to go to him on bended knee for social ad­ vancement, now cut him in Rotten Row. Sir Thomas Lipton will not come near the court again he is too shrewd to expose himself to a certain snub. Lord Marcus Beresford main­ tains a discreet retirement among his horses at Newmarket. Mrs. George Keppel has gone for a voyage around the world that will occupy two years. Mrs. Hall Walker, wife of the multi­ millionaire brewer and racing king, is staying quietly at her country home. The old, staid nobility has come back into its own. The court is ex­ actly as it was under Victoria fifty years ago. At Balmoral all the lights go out at 10:30 at night. In the evenings, about the time Edward was getting ready for his game of bridge, George and Mary are putting the chil­ dren to bed. There will be no scan­ dal in this reign. TAFT RAPS 8 LAW III HIS MESSAGE WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 16.— The 8-hoUr law as he would have it is described by President Taft in his message to congress at considerable length. With many preliminary high sounding phrases he solemnly affirms his desire to make the law effective. All goes well until the tail end of his recommendations are reached and then the following weakening list of exceptions are pointed out by mem­ bers of the labor lobby as practically nullifying all that has gone before. Here are the president's words: "To require, however, that every small contract of manufacture en­ tered into by the government should be carried out by the contractor with men working at eight hours would be to impose an intolerable burden upon the government by limiting its sources of supply and excluding al­ together the great majority of those who would otherwise compete for its business. "The proposed act recognizes this in the exceptions which it makes to contracts 'for transportation by land or water, for the transmission of in­ telligence, and for such material or articles as may usually be bought in the open market whether made to conform to particular specifications or not.'" That these deftly inserted "excep­ tions" to the 8-hour law are such as will allow a mass of evasions by gov­ ernment contractors is the firm be­ lief of labor leaders in Washington. A law with a leak is as fatal to wage workers as no law at all, and the de­ partment of justice is working over­ time to find the holes which will turn the construction of navy vessels, machinery and material for the Pa­ nama canal ove£ to shops that work their men 10 and 12 hours a day. 

DIAZ SEEKS TO GET HAND ON THROAT OF ANOTHER CHAMPION GF LIBERTY WASHINGTON, Dec. 16—The Mex­ ican authorities have asked the state department for the extradition of Juan Sanchey Azcona, a native of Mexico, on the charge of misappropriation of the funds of a charitable Institution. The alleged crime is said to have been committed four years ago. The requisition papers for Azcona doesn't mention the name of the charitable institution, nor specify the amount of funds Azcona is alleged to have taken. The man wanted is a close friend of Madero, the revolutionary leader. He was formerly editor of a news­ paper called Antive-Electionista, pub­ lished in- Mexico City. During the recent political campaign in Mexico, the paper was suppressed, and its editor warned that his arrest was im­ minent and his life in danger. He left Mexico City secretly in the night and escaped across the border, with Felix Diaz, Mexico's chief of po­ lice and nephew of the president, at his heels. He is now in San Antonio, 'lex. Although Azcona has been in the United State* but a few months the Mexican authorities respectfully re­ quest his extradition for a crime ai~ leged to have been committed four years ago.
