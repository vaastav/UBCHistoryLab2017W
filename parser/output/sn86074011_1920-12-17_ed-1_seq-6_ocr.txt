THE ABEBDEEH WEESLY, ABEHDEEH, MISSISSIPPI VILSON TELLS UNITED STATES MUST LEAD WORLD TO DEMOCRACY Should Correct by Legislation Injustices in Our National Life As Proof That Democracy Is Fair Washington. President Wilson, In Ids nnnual congressional message, tailed on Congress to enact a program of legislation which he said would put toe United States In the forefront of a movement to make the spiritual power of democracy prevail through out the world. The message was sent t- the two Houses December 7 by messenger. The President said there are two ways in which the United States can lead in establishing the doctrine of "right makes might" In the world. These ways, he said, are: "First, by offering the example with in her nvn borders of the will and power of democracy to make and en force laws which are unquestionably Just and which are equal in their ad ministration. Second, by standing for right and justice as toward Individual nations." Submits a Program. 'xhe President declared that "the dis play of an immediate disposition on the part of Congress to remedy any Injustices or evils that may have thown themselves in our own national life will afford the most effectual off set to the forces of choas and tyranny which are playing so disastrous a part in the fortunes of free peoples in more than one part of the world." Wilson did not mention the peace treaty or League of Nations In his message, but submitted the following program to carry out the aims he out lined : 1. Immediate passage of the budget bill. 2. Strictest economy in Government appropriations. 3. ' Immediate revision ofrtax laws. 4. Adequate provision for disabled Soldiers and sailors. 5. A Government loan to Armenia. 0. Granting of independence to the Philippines. Immortal Lincoln Quotation. The President's speech in substance follows: 'When I addressed myself to per forming the duty laid upon the Presi dent by the Constitution to present to you an annual report on the state of the Union I found myself dominated by an immortal sentence of Abraham Lincoln's, 'Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it,' a sentence immortal because it em bodies In a form of utter simplicity and purity the essential state t)f the na tion, the faith in which it was. con ceived and the faith in which it has grown to glory and power. "With that faith and the birth of a nation founded upon it came the hope" into the world that a new order would prevail throughout the affair of man kind, an order In which reason and right would take precedence of covet-ousnt-ss and force, and I believe that I express the wish and purpose of every thoughtful American when I say that this sentence marks for us in the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the arrangements of our domestic affairs and in our exercise of influence upon the affairs of the world. "By this faith and by this faith alone, can the world be lifted out of Its present confusion and despair. Beginning of the End. "It was this faith which prevailed over the wicked force of Germany, You will remember that the beginning of the end of war came when the German people found themselves face to face with the conscience of the world and realized that right was everywhere arrayed against the wrong that their Government was attempting to perpe trate. "I think, therefore, that it Is true to say that this was the faith which won the war. Certainly this is the faith with which our gallant men went Into the field and out upon the seas to make sure of victory. This is the mlsson upon which democracy came Into the world. I think we all realize that the day has come when democracy is being put upoa its final test. "The Old World Is just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the prin ciple of democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as as serted In the name but without the authority and sanction of the multi tude. Two Way to Help. "There are two ways In which the United Srates can assist to accomplish this great object : First, by offering the example within her own borders of the will and power of democracy to make and enforce laws which are unques tionably just and which are equal In their administration laws which se cure Its full right to tabor and yet at The Reassuring Word.

CONGRESS the same time safeguard the integrity of proi-erty and particularly of that property which Is devoted to the de velopment of Industry and the Increase of the necessary wealth of the world. "Second, by standing for right and justice as toward individual nations, The law of democracy is for the pro tection of the weak and the Influence of every democracy in the world should be for the protection of the weak na tion. Forces of Chaos and Tyranny. "The United States cannot refuse this role of champion without putting the stigma of rejection upon the great and devoted men who brought Its Gov ernment Into existence and established it In the face of almost universal op position and intrigue, even in the face of wanton force. "I urge you to consider that the dis play of an immediate disposition on the part of Congress to remedy any Injustices or evils that may have shown themselves in our own national life will afford the most effectual off set to the forces of choas and tyranny which are playing so disastrous a part in the fortunes of the free peoples of more than one part of the world. The United States is of necessity the sam ple democracy of the world, and the triumph of democracy depends upon its success. Disastrous Effects of War. "Recovery from the disturbing and sometimes disastrous effects of the late wr has been exceedingly slow on the other side of the water and has given promise, I venture to say, of early completion only in our own .fortunate country, but even with us the recovery halts and is impeded at times and there are immediately serv iceable acts of legislation which It seems to me we ought to attempt to assist that recovery and prove the In destructible recuperative force of a great Government of the people. "One of these is to prove that a great, democracy can keep house as successfully and In as business-like a fashion as any government.. It seems to me that the first step towards prov ing this Is to supply ourselves with a systematic method of handling our estimates and expenditures and bring ing them to the point where they will not be an unnecessary strain upon our income or necessitate unreasonable taxation In other words, as workable budget system, and I respectfully sug gest that two elements are essential to such a system, namely, not only Lthat the proposal of appropriations should be in the hands of a single body such as a single Appropriations Com mittee but also that this body should be brought into such co-operation with the departments of the Government and with the Treasury of the United Jjtates as would enable It to act upon a complete conspectus of the needs of the Government and the resources from which It must draw its Income. Reluctant Veto of Budget. "I reluctantly vetoed the budget bill passed by the last session of the Con gress because of a constitutional ob jection. "The House of Representatives sub sequently modified the bill In order to meet this objection. In the revised form I believe that the bill coupled with action already taken by the Con gress to revise its rules and procedure. furnishes the foundations for an effec tive national budget system," "I earnestly hope, therefore, that one of the first steps taken by the present session of Congress will be to pass the budget bill. "The nation's finances ' have shown marked Improvement during the past year. The total ordinary receipts of $1.G4.000,000 for the fiscal year, 1920, exceeded those for 19i9 by $1,542,000, 000 while the total net ordinary ex-; penditures decreased from $18,514, 000.000. "The gross public debt, which reached Its highest point on Aug. 31, 1919, when It was $20..r9G000,00 had dropped on Nov. 30. 1920. to $24,175. 000.000. There has also been a marked decrease In holdings of government war securities by the banking instltu- tlons of the country as well as in the amount of bills held by the Federal Reserve Banks secured by government war obligations. Urges Economy. "The cessation of the Government's borrowing except through short-term certificates of indebtedness has been a matter of great confluence to the pecple of the country at large, as well a to the holders of Liberty Bonds and Victory Notes, and has had an 'impor tant bearing on the matter of effective credit control. The year has been characterized by the progressive with-1 Mistake or Confession? The nervous bridegroom was called upon to make a speech at the wedding breakfast.

Her Friend-You always were a reckless girl, J .goes. .. . " drawal of the" Treasury from the do mestic credit market and from a posi tion of dominant influence in that mar ket. "The fundamental fact which at present dominates the Government's financial situation is that $7,500,000, 000 of its war. Indebtedness mature within the next two and a half years. Of this amount $2,500,000,000 are float ing debt and $5,00.000,000 Victory notes and war savings certificates. The fiscal program of the Government must be determined with reference to'these maturities. With rigid economy, vig orous salvage operations and adequate revenues from taxation, a surplus of current receipts over current expendi tures can be realized and should be applied to tne floating debt. Would Cut Expenses. "It cannot overemphasize the neces sity of economy in Government appro priations and expenditures and the avoidance by tlie Congress of prac tices which take money from the treas ury by indefinite or revolving fund appropriations. The estimates for the present year show that over a billion dollars of expenditures were author ized by the last Congress In addition to the amounts shown In the usual compiled statements of appropriations. "This strikingly illustrates the. Im portance of making direct and specific appropriations. The relations between the current receipts and current ex penditures of the Government during the present fiscal year, as well as dur ing the last half of the last fiscal year, have been disturbed by the extraordi nary burdens thrown upon the Treas ury by the transportation act, In con nection with the return of the railroads to private control. Over $000,000,000 has already been paid to the railroads under this act $350,000,000 during the present fiscal year and It Is estimated that further payments aggregating pos sibly ?Go0.0ft0,000 must still be made to the railroads during the current year. It Is obvious that these large payments have already seriously lim ited the Government's progress In re tiring the floating debt. Tax Revision Urged. "Closely connected wltn this. It seems to me, is the necessity for an Immediate consideration of the revi sion of our tax laws. "Simplification of the income and profits taxes has become an immediate necessity. These taxes performed an indispensable service during the war. The need for their simplification, how ever. Is very great, in order to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense and in order to make his liability more certain and definite. "It is my privilege to draw to the attention of Congress for very sym pathetic consideration the problem of providing facilities for the care and treatment of former members of the military and naval forces who are sick or disabled as the result of their par ticipation in the war. The nation's gratitude must be effectively revealed to them by the most ample provision for their medical care and treatment, as well as for their vocational training and placement. The time has come when a more complete program can be formulated and more satisfactorily administered for their treatment and training, and I earnestly urge L.at the Congress give the matter its early con sideration. - "Cold Storage Law Advised." "Permit me to emphasize once more the need for action upon certain mat ters upon which I dwelt at some length In my message to the second session of the Sixty-sixth Congress : The necessity, for example, of encourag ing the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals ; the importance of doing everything possible to piomote agricultural production nlrng economic lines, to improve agricultural market ing and to make rural life more attrac tive and healthful; the need for a law regulating cold storage In such a way as to limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribing the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and requiring goods released from storage in all cases to bear the, date of their receipt. "It would also be most serviceable if it were provided that all goods re leased from cold storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon eacli package the price or mar ket at which they went into storage, n order that the purchaser might be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. Indeed, it would be very serv iceable to the public if all goods des tined for interstate commerce were made to carry xipon every packing case whose form made it possible a plain statement of the price at which they left the hands of the producer. I re spectfully call your attention, also, to the recommendations of the message referred to with regard to a federal license for all corporations engaged in interstate commerce. Loan to Armenia Favored. "In response to what I believe to be the Impulse of sympathy and opln inon throughout the United States, I earnestly suggest that the Congress au thorize the Treasury of the L'nlted States to make to tlie struggling Gov ernment of Armenia such a lo-n as was made to several of the allied Gov- ernments during the war; and I would f Substitutes.

Louisville Ciurier-.TournaL also suggest that It would be desirable to provide In the legislation Itself that the expenditure of the mony thus loaned should be under the supervision of a commission, or at least a commis sioner, from the United States, in or der that revolutionary tendencies with in Armenia itself might not be afforded by the loan of a further tempting op portunity. Would Free Filipinos. "Allow me to call your attention to the fact that the people of the Plillip- pine Islands have succeeded in main talning a stable government since the last action of Congress in their behalf, and have thus fulfilled tlte condition set by the Congress as precedent to a consideration of granting independence to the Islands. I respectfully submit that this condition precedent havin been fulfilled, it is now our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the people of those Islands by granting them the Independence which they so honorably covet.
