The relations of the department with railroad companies have ieen harmonized, notwithstanding the gen eral redaction by Congress of their compensation, by tbe appropriation for epecial facilities, and tbe railway post-office lioes have been greatly ex tended, especially in the Southern States. The interests of the railway mail service and of the public would be greatly promoted, and tbe expen ditures could lie more readily con trolled by the classification of the employees of the railway-mail service as recommended by tbe Postmaster General, tbe appropriation for sala ries, with respect to which tbe maxi mum limit is already fixed Ly law, to be made in gross. The Pootmaiiler General recom nunda an amendment of the law reg ulating the increase of compensation for increased service and increased speed on star routes, to as to enable him to advertise for proposals such increased service aud tpeed.

INDIANS. TLe reports of the Secretary of tbe Interior and of the Commission of Indian Affairs, setting forth the pres cct elate of our relations with the In dian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance their civ ilization and prosperity, and tbe progress already achieved by them, will be found of more than ordinary iuterest. The general conduct of our Indian opulalion has been so satisfactory that tbe occurrence of two disturbances, which resulted iu bloodshed and destruction of proper ty, is all tbe more to be lamented. Tbe history of tbe outbreak on the White Iliver Ute reservation in Wes tern Colorado has become so famil iar by elaborate reports in tbe public press, that its remarkable incidents need not be staled here iu detial. It is expected that Ibe settlement of this difficulty wiK lead to such ar rangements as will prevent further hostile contact between the Indians and tbe border settlements in Wes tern Colorado. Tbe other disturbance occurred at the Mescalero agency, in New Mexi co, where Victoria, tbe head of a small band of marauders, after com mitting many atrocities, being vigor ously chased by a military force, made his way across the Mexican border, and is now on foreign soil. While these occurrences, in which a cemparatively small number of our Indian population have fully justified tbe expectations of those who believe that by humane and peaceful inOu ences the Indian can be led to aban don the habits of savage life and to develop a capacity lor useful and civilized occupations. What tbey have already accomplished in tbe pursuit of agriciltural aud mechanical work, the remarkable success which has attended tbe exiierimeot of em ploy ins as freighters a class of In dians hitherto counted among lb wildest and most intractable, and tbe general and urgent desire expresses by them for tbe education of their children, may be taken as suffiiU-nt proof that tbey will be fouud capable Ol accomplishing much more if tbey continue to be wisely aud fairly guided. Tbe "Indian policy "sketch ed in the report of the Secretary of tbe Interior, tbe ol ject of which is to make liberal provision for the educa tion of Indian youth, to settle the In dians upon farm-lots in eeveiality, to give them title in fee to their farms, inalienable for a certain number of years, and when their wants are thus provided for, to dispose by sale of the, lands on their reservations not occupied and used by them, a fund to be formed out of the proceeds for tbe benefit of tbe Indians, which will gradually relieve tbe Government ot Ibe expenses now provided for by annual appropriations, must com mend itself as just and beneficial to tbe Indians, ' and as also calculated to remove those obstructions which the existence of large reservations presents to the settlement and devel opment of tbe country. I therefore earnestly recommend tbe enactment of a law enabling the government to give Indians a title in fee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to tbe farm lands assigned to them by allotment. 1 also repeat the recommendation made in my first annual message, that a law be passed admitting In dians who can give satisfactory proof 01 caving, Dy their own labor, sup ported their lamflies for a number of years, and who are willing to detach themselves from their tribal rela tions, to the benefit of the Lomebtead act, and to grant tbem patents con taining tbe came provision of in alienability for a certain period. Tbe experiment of sending a num ber of Indian children, of both scat', to the Hampton Normal and Agntui tural Institute, in Virginia, to re ceive an elementary English educa tion and practical instruction in (aim ing and other useful industries, has led to results so promising that it was thought expedient to turn over the cavalry barricks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the Interior Depart ment for tbe establishment of an In dian school on a large scale. This school has now one hundred and fifty-eight pupils, selected from va rioua tribes, and u in fuli operation. Arrangements are also made for the education of a number of. Indian boys and girls belonging to trittts on the Tacific elope, in a similar man ner, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institutions will commend themselves to tbe liberality of Cuu- ...I in ih i.l.ilanilirnnir inn- '.Scene of tbe American peopl. ., fglloMlion o mQ . tbUe niovetreut in tbe Wetter n j gu-a, the oljc, of which m tbe 'oocui it::- bv unauthwiZ'-tf i ron 0rct'rUiii lunda iutbe Iridiao lerrito- rT cJed bv the Cberokea to the go- eminent for ie purpose f stUle- ment by other tribes. On the 27lh of April I issued a proclamation ' warning all persons against participation in 6uch an at tempt, and, by the co-operation of a military force tbe invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect tbe rights of tbe Indian inhabitants of that Territory to the full extent of the Execuitve power. Dut it would be unwise to ignore the fact that a Territory so large and so fertile, with a population so sparse and with so great a wealth ot unused resources, will be more exposed to tbe repetition of such attempts as hanoened this vear. when the sur- lounding States are more densely settled, and the westward movement of our population looks 6lill more eagerly for fresb lauds to occupy. Lndersucb circumstancts the dim- cully of maintaining the Indian Ter ritory in Us present state will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes in habiting it would do well lo prepare for such a contingency. I, therefore, fully approve of the advice given to them by the Secretary of the Interior on a recent occaston,to divide amon themselves in severally as larire a quantity of their lands as they can cultivate, to acquire individual title iu fee, instead of their present tribal ownership in common, and lo consid er iu bat manner the balance of their lands Kay be disposed of bvtbe Gov ernment for their bent-fit. By adopt ing such a policy they would more certainly secure for themselves tbe value of their possessions, and at tbe same time promote their progress in civilization and perpetuate the pres ent tUte of things i i ' te lerritory. The question whether a change in tbe coutrol of the Indian service nhould be made, was in the Forty fifih Congiess relerred to a joint com uiittee of both Houses for inquiry aud report. In my last annual mes sage I expressed tbe boe that the decision of that question, then in prospect, "would arrest further agi tation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing ef tect upon tbe service as well as tbe Indians themselves." Since then, the committee having reported, tbe ques tion has been decided in the nega tive by a vote in the House of Rep resentatives. For the reasons here staled, and in view of tbe fact that further uncer tainty on this point will be calculat ed lo obstruct other, much needed legislation, to weaken the discipline of the service, and to unsettle saluta ry measuies now in progress for the government and improvement of the Indians, I respectfully recommend that the decision arrived at by Con gress at its last session be permitted to stand.

TIMBER LANDS. The efforts made ny the depart ment of tbe Interior to arrest the dep redations on tbe timber lands of tbe United States have been continued, and have met with considerable suc cess. A large number of cases of trespass have been prosecuted in tbe Courts of the United States : others have been settled, the tresspassers offering to make payment to tbe gov ernment for tbe value of tbe timber taken bv tbem. The proceeds of these prosecution and settlements turned into the Treasury, far exceeds in amount the sum appropriated by Congress for this purpose, A more important result, however, consists iu the fact that tbe destructiou ol our public foiests, by depredation, a ihouch ucb cases still occur has been creatlv reduced in extent, and it is probable that if tbe preseut poli cv is vigorously oursued and suffi cient provision to that end is made by Congress, such trespasses, at least those on a large scale, can be entire ly suppressed, except in the lerrito ries where timber for tbe daily re quirements of the population cannot, uuder the present state ol the law, be otherwise obtained. 1 therefore earnestly invite the attention of Cou cress to the recommendation mad tiy the Secretary of tne Interior, that a law be enacted enabling the gov. eminent to sell timber from the pub lie lands, withuut convening the . fee, where such lands are principally valu able for the titular thereon, such sales to be so regulated as tocoutorui to domestic want aud business re quirements, while at the same time guarding agaiula a sweeping deslruc lion of the forests. Tbe enactment of such a law appears to become a more pressing necessity everyday. AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS. My recommendations in former messages are renewed in favor of en larging the facilities of tbe Depart ment of agriculture is the leading in terest and the permanent industry of our people. It is to tbe abuudance of agricultural production, as com pared with our borne consumption, and tbe largely increased and tbe highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent years, lhat we are mainly indebted for our present prosperity as a peo pie. We must look for its continued maintenance to tbe same substantial resource. ' There is no.brancb of in dustry in wbicb labor, directed by scientific knowledge, yields such in creased ' production in con ran ,m ith unskilled labor, and no brai.ch ot the public service lo which the t n couragemcnt cf liberal appropria tions can lie more appropriately ex tended. The omission to rendei such aid is not a wise economy ; but, on Ibe contrary, undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums annually tbat might be saved through well di rected efforts by the government to pron.ote this vital interest. Tbe results already accomplished with tbe very limited means hereto fore placed at the command of the Department of Agriculture is an ear nest of what may be expected with increased appropriations for Ibe sev eral purposes indicated in the report of Ibe Commissioner, with a view of placing the Department upon a fool ing wbicb will enable it lo prosecute more effectively the ot jects for wbicb it is established.

R. B. 1IAYK3 Executive Mansion, December 1, 1879 raeta Abeat lbs Peasloi i Odice. Hon. J. A. Bentley, Commissioner of Pensions, has completed his annual report to tbe Secretary of Interior It Dhows that on the 30 b of June last tbere were 242,755 persons in ibe Uniied States receiving pensions from tbe Government, Tbe pension list is nnw larger tban at anv previ ous time. It is c imp 'ed of 125 150 a-iny invalid pea-1 ners, 81 174 rmy widows, children and dependent 'pi atives. 1.844 navy invlid, 1 782 navv widoa-s. etc.. 11.621 surviving soldiers of tbe war of 1812. and 21 IfU widows of deceased soldiers of tbat war. . During tbe year 31 346 new names were added to tbe list, and 903 names which had previously been dropped from the rolls, mainly from failure for three years to claim tbeir pensions, were restored and 13.497 were for various reasons drop ped. Tbe aggregate amount of one year's pension to all pensioners on "tbe roils is $25,493,742 15. but the actual annual payment exceeds that sum by several million dollars. This arises from tbe fact tbat nearly all r.ewly admitted army and navy cartes bad several years accrued pension due at tbe lime of admission, which was paid at the firt pnvmnt. The Jay .' The Philadelphia Times has a three column article in which tbe astonii-b ing fact is developel tbat after all tbe enormous costs aud long delays tbe creditors of tbe Jay Cooke estate are overpaid They realize $1,225 on every $1,000. This is due to tbe re cent remarkable rise in prices of Northern Pacific and other stock wbicb were assigned the Jay Conke creditors in satisfaction of their claims. Northern Pacific shares, wbicb were at 16 at tbe lime tbey were distrib uted went up to 50 witbin 2 months recently, and still upward and up ward beyond sixty. Tbe great wheat field of the Northwest sent tbeir golden harvests over tbe Northern Pacific Railroad to tbe East, and now Mr. Cooke lives to see the world ac kaowledge his rare foresight and to admit that his faith in tbe Northern Pacific Railroad, which bad been a jest for years, was built on a Bound and enduring foundation. The other securities held by the creditors also went op and stayed up, in keeping with the appreciations of Northern Pacific, and now are more valuable than the wildest enthusiast could have dreamed six months ago.

LIBIUJO DIUVV tUQ VVOV v the year iu excess of tbe number settled, added to u umber shown by the record, will aggregate fully 200,000. Since the pasnagd of the arrears act, new invalid, widows, minor children aud dependent relatives' claims have baeu filed at an unprecedented rale. It is estimated that at tbe close of the year tbere will be not less tban 250,000 unsettled cases before tbe ulliCri. The law is plain in regard to pen siuns. "Any soldier disabled in line of duty, by wouud, diseases of any kiud, or by accident, shall be entitled to receive a pension. Tbe rate of pension is determined by tbe degree ol disability. A very eligbi disabil ity receives a small pension and greater disability in proportion." A disability, as nligbt as tbe loss of a little finger, is sufficient. Pension money is not a gratuity or charity on tbe part of the Goverumeut. li is paying for services rendered. You were told when you enlisted that "if while serving your enlistment you should become id any way disabled then you shall be paid as long as tbat disability lasts for the amount ot time or labor you lose because of that disability." Thus you see the granting of pensions to the soldier or to his widow or dependent rela tives, is simply a plain, houorable business transaction, and every one entitled thereto should step forward and receive it. If anybody else owed you, you would try an1 collect it, would yon not; Of course you would. Well, Uucle Sam is able to pay all bis nonest debts, and no class of people are better entitled to be paid iban those who served tbe Government in its hour of danger. rruui ,wliat 1 can learn, I suppose uearly all of tbe just claims from the 17th Peunsvlvauia district arson file here by mis time, borne have been settled and paid, others have not 1 know of several persons ot this latter class who expect our member to walk right up tbe first day of Con gress and fix tbe thing at once. Now, my frieud, (tor I cousider every old soldier my friend) don i fool yourself. Things go slow here in tbe pension business when the evidence furnish ed is not conclusive. Tbe Govern ment officers want to do right, but there are many unjust claims with tbe good, that it takes considerable time to silt tbe wheat from tbe chuff.
