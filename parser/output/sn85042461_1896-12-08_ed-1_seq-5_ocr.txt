CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS Information Given on Na tional Affairs PM LEGISLATION SUGGESTED Turkish Troubles Do Not War rant Our Interference THE INSURGENTS IN CUBA Have Done Nothing to Entitle Them to Recognition Though American Interests May Vet Make Decisive Action Necessary The Great Duty of the Hour Is the Ex ercise of Rigid Economy In the Affairs of the Nation. (Transmit.*- with the compliments of the Western Union Telegraph Company.) WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â€”Following is President Cleveland's message, sent to congress today: The Congress of the United States: As representatives of the people in the leg islative branch of their government, you have assembeld at a lime when the strength and excellence of our free in stitutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest in volving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension, and creating aggressiveness so intense as to approach bitterness and passion has been waged throughout our land, and determined by the decree of free and in dependent suffrage, without disturb ance of our tranquillity or the least sign of weakness in our national structure. When we consider these incidents t_nd contemplate tho peaceful obedience and manly submission which have suc ceeded a heated clash of political opin ions, we discover abundant evi dence of a determination on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of tbe popular will and to be controlled at all times by an abid ing faith in the agencies established for Ihe direction of the affairs of the government. Thus our people exhibil a patriotic disposition which ensures to those Who undertake to make and exe cute their laws such faithful and im plicit service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious appreciation of ihe trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty invites. In obedience to a constitutional re quirement I hereby submit to congress certain Information concerning nation al affairs, with the suggestion of such legislation as in my judgment is neces sary and expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tiresome narration, I shall unit many details concerning matters within federal control which, by no means unimportant, ate more profita bly- discussed in departmental reports. 1 shall also further curtail this commu nication by omitting a minute recital of any minor incidents connected with our foreign relations which have hereto fore found place In executive messages, hut are now contained In a report of the secretary of state which is herewith submitted. 'SNOIiVaECH NOE_HO_i At the outs*t of reference to the more important matters affecting our rela tions with foreign powers, it would af ford me satisfaction if I could assure the congress that the disturbed condltiun in Asiatic Turkey had during the past year assumed a less hideous a..d bloody as pect, and that either as a consequence of the awakening of tlie Turkish govern ment to the demands of humane civili zation or as a result of decisive action on the part of the great nations having ths right by treaty to interfere for the pro lection of those exposed to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanaticism, that the shocking features of the situation had been mitigated. Instead, however of welcoming a soft ened disposition or protective interven tion we have been afflicted by continued and not unfrequent reports of the wan ton destruction of houses, and the bloody butchery of men, women and Children, made martyrs to their profes sion of Christian faith. "While none of our citizens in Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded, though often In the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety in the future is by no means assured. Our government at home, and our minister at Constantinople have left nothing undone to protect our mission aries lv utloman territory, who consti tute nearly all the individuals residing there who have a right to claim our pro tection on the score oi American citizen ship. Our efforts in this direction will not be relaxed, but the deep feeling and sympa thy that has been raised among our people ought not so far to blind their reason and judgment as to lead them to demand Impossible things. The out breaks of blind fury which lead to mur der and pillage in Turkey occur sudden ly and without notice, and an attempt on our part to force such a hostile pres ence there as might be effective for pre vention or protection would not only be resisted by the Ottoman government, but would be regarded as an interrup tion of their plans by the great nations who assert their exclusive right to in tervene in their own time and method for the security of life and property in Turkey. Several naval vessels are stationed In the Mediterranean, as a measure of cau tion and to furnish all possible relief and refuge In case of emergency. We made claims against the Turkish gov ernment for the pillage and destruction of missionary property at Harpool and Maiash during uprising at these places. Thus far the validity of these demands has not been admitted, though our min ister, prior to such outrages and in an ticipation of danger, demanded pro tection for the persons and property of our missionary citizens in the localities mentioned, and, notwithstanding that strong evidence exists of the actual com plicity of Turkish soldiers In the work of destruction and robbery, the facts as they now appear, do not permit us to doubt the justice of these claims, and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt settlement. A number of Armenian refugees having arrived at our ports, an order has recently been obtained from the Turkinsh government permitting the wives and children of such refugees to join them here. It is hoped that hereafter no obstacle will be Interposed to prevent the escape of all those who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them in Turkish dominions. Our recently appointed consul to Er lseroum is at. his post and discharging the duties of his office, though for some un accountable reason his formal exequa lor from the sultan has not been Issued. I do not believe that the present somber prospect in Turkey will be long per mitted to offend the sight of Christen dom. It so mars the humane and en lightened civilization that belongs to the close of the nineteenth century that It seems hardly possible that the earnest demand of good peopla throughout the Christian world for Its corrective treat ment will remain unanswered. THE 

CUBAN INSURRECTION. The insurrection in Cuba still contin ues with all Its perplexities. It Is diffi cult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made toward the pacifica tion of the island, or that the situation of affairs as depicted In my last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the sea ports and all the considerable towns, the Insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the island country. If the determination ofSpain to put down the insurrection seems but to strength en with the lapse of time, and is evinced by her unhesitating devotion of largely Increased military and naval forces to the task, there is much reason to be lieve that the Insurgents have gained in point of numbers and character and re sources and are none the less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb without practically securing the great object for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet. re-established her authority, neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to b regarded as an In dependent state. Indeed, as the contest has gone on, the pretense that civil gov ernmnt exists on the Island, except so far as Spain is able to maintain it, has been practically abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a government more or less Imperfectly, In the large towns and their immediate suburbs, but, that ex ception being made, the entire country is given over to anarchy or is subject to the military occupation of one of the other party. It is reported, Indeed, on re liable authority, that at the demand of the commander-in-chief of the insurg ent army the putative Cuban govern ment has now given up all attempts to exercise its functions, leaving that gov ernment confessedly (what there is the best reason to suppose It always to have been tn fact) a government mere ly on paper. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists In the open or pitched battle, a prompt and de cisive result might be looked for and the immense superiority of the Spanish forces in numbers, discipline and equip ment could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage. But they are called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements, that can choose and does choose its own ground, that from the nature of the country Is visible or invisible at pleas ure, and that lights only from ambus cade and when all the advantages of position and numbers are on itsside. In | a country where all that Is lndispensa i ble to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtained, espe cially by those horn and bred on the soil, it is obvious tiiat there Is hardly a limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, j in all cases of protracted civil strife, the I passions of the combatants grow more and more inflamed and excesses on both sides become more frequent and more deplorable. Their attacks are partici pated' in by bands of marauders who, now In the name of one party and now tn the name of another, an may best suit i the occasion, harass the country at will and plunder its wretched inhabitants for their own advantage. Such a condi tion of things would inevitably entail Immense destruction of property even if it were the purpose of both parties to prevent It as far as practicable. But while such seems to be the original pol icy of the Spanish government it has ! now apparently abandoned it, and is ! acting upon the same theory as the in j surgents. namely, that the exigencies of the contest require the wholesale an ' nihilatlon of property that it may not I prove of any use and advantage to the ' enemy. . It is lo the same end that In pursuance j of general orders, Spanish troops are now being withdrawn from plantations and Ihe rural population required to con centrate itself in the towns. The sure re sult would seem to be that the Indus trial value of the Island is fast dimin ishing, and that unless there Is a speedy and radical change in existing conditions it will soon disappear altogether. That value conssts very largely, of course, in its capacity to produce sugar, a e-a --j pacity already much reduced by Lhe in terruptions to tillage which havelakten place during the last two years. It is re liably asserted that these interruptions continue during the current year, and pratically extend, as it now is threaten ed, to the entire sugar-producing terri tory of the island. So much time and so much money will be required to restore the land to its normal productiveness that it is extremely doubtful if capital can be induced to even make the at tempt. The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the whole globe, would engage the serious attention of the government and the people of the United Slates in any cir cumstances. In point of fact they have a concern with it which is by no means of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic character. It lies so near to us as to be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary Interest in it is second only to that of the people and government of Spain. It Is reasonably estimated that at least from $30,000,000 â–  to 150,000,000 of American capital is in vested in plantations and in railroads, mining and other business enterprises on the Island. The volume of trade between the I'nited States and Cuba, which in ISS9 amounted to about $6-1.000,000, rose in ISOIJ to about $103,000,000, and in 1594, the | year before the present insurrection I broke out, amounted to nearly ?!K;;000,000. | Besides this large pecuniary stake in the i fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds | itself Inextricably involved in the pres ent contest in other ways, both vexa tious and costly. Many Cubans reside in this country, and indirectly promote the insurrection through the press, by public meeting.?, by the purehas/e and shipment of arms, by the raising of funds, and by othÂ«r means which the spirit of our institu tions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made the subject of crlmi â–  nal prosecutions. Some of them, thor ough Cubans at heart, and In all their feelings and interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens o" the United States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible protection by this government, and not unreasonably re garded with mu-h Indignation by the country of their origin. The Insurgents i are undoubtedly encouraged and sup : ported hy the widespread sympathy the I people of this country always and In ! stlnctlvely feel for every struggle for j better and freer government, and which. In the case of the more adventurous and | restless elements of our people, leads in I only too many instances to active and l personal participation In the contest. The result Is that this government "is I constantly called upon to protect Ameri can citizens who claim damages for ln | juries to persons and property, now es- I timated at many millions of dollars, and 'to ask explanations and apologies fo' the acts of Spanish officials whose zeal for the repression Of the rebellion some times blinds them to the Immunities ba ! longing to the unoffending citizen of a friendly power. It follows from the same causes that the United Slates is compelled actively lo police a long line of sea coast .against unlawful expedi tions, the escape of which the utmost vigilance will not always suffice to pre vent, These Inevitable entanglements of the United States wilh the rebellion In Cuba, the large American property Interests affected and considerations ol philanthropy and humanity In general have led to a vehement demand In va rious quarters for some sort, of positive intervention on the part of the United States. It was at first proposed that belliger ent rights should be accorded the In surgents, a proposition no longer weigh ed because untimely and In practical I

It haa since been and is now sometimes contended that the Independence of the Insurgents should be recognized. But Imperfect and restricted as the Spanish government of the island may be, no other government exists there, unless the will of a military officer In temporary command of a par ticular district can be dignified as a species of government. It is now also suggested that the United States should buy the island, a suggestion possibly worthy *f consideration, were there any evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a por posal. It Is urged, finally, that all other methods failing, the existing internecine strife in Cuba should be terminated by our Intervention, even at the cost of a war between the United States and Spainâ€”a war which Its advocates coniV der.tly prophesy could be neithei large In Its proportions nor doubtful In Its Issue. Tne correctness of this forecast need be neither affirmed nor denied. The United States has nevertheless a character to maintain as a nation, which plainly dictates that right and not might should be the rule of its conduct. Fur tner. though the United States is not a nation to which peace is a necessity: it Is in truth the most pacific of powers and desires nothing so mucn as to live in amity with all the world. Its own ample and diversified domains satisfy all possible longings for territory, preclud ing all dreams of conquest and prevent any casting of covetous eyes upon neigh boring regions, however attractive. That our conduct toward Spain and her do minions has shown no exception to this national disposition, is made manifest by the course of our government not on ly thus far during the present insurrec tion, but during the ten years that fol lowed the rising at Yara tn 1868. No other great power, it may safely be said, under circumstances of similar perplexity, would have manifested the same restraint and the same patient en durance. It may also be said that this persistent attitude of the United States towards Spain in connection with the Cuban question unquestionably evinces no slight respect and regard for Spain on the part of the American people. They In truth do not forget her connection with the discovery of the western hemis phere, nor do they underestimate the great qualities of the Spanish people, nor fail fully to recognize their splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devo tion to the national honor. They view with wonder and admiration the cheer ful resolution with which vast bodies of men are sent across thousands of miles of ocean and an enormous debt accu mulated that the costly possession of the Clem of the Antilles may still hold its place In the Spanish crown. And yet neither the government nor the people in the United States have shut their eyes to the course of events in Cuba or have failed to realize the extent of conceded grievances which have led to the present revolt from the authority of Spainâ€”grievances recognized by the queen regent and by the coites, voiced by the most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish statesmen, without regard to party, and demonstrated by reforms proposed by the executive and approved by the legislative branch of tho Span ish government. It Is In the assumed temper and disposition of the Spanish government to remedy these grievances fortified by indications of influential opinion In Spain, that this gov ernment has hoped to discover the most promising and effective means of composing the present strife with honor and advantage to Spain and with the achievement of all the reasonable objects of Insurrection. It would seem that If Spain would of fer Cuba autonomy, a measure of heme rule, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy all rational re quirements of her Spanish subjects, there should be no just reason why the pacification of the island might not be effected on that basis. Such a result would appear to be In the true Interest of all concerned. It would at once stop the conflict which Is now consuming the resources of the Island, and making It worthless for whichever party may ultimately prevail. Tt would keep Intact the possessions of Spain without touching her honor, which will he consulted rather than Impugned by the adequate redress of admitted griev ances. It would put the prosperity of the Isl and and the fortunes of Its Inhabitants within their own control, without sever ing the national and ancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and would yet enable them to test their ca pacity for self-government under the most favorable conditions. It has been objected on the one side that Spain would not promise autonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down, their arms, on the other side that promised autono my, however liberal, is insufficient be cause without assurance of the promise being fulfilled; but the reasonableness of the requirement by Spain, of uncondl j tional surrender on the part of the insur gent Cubans before their autonomy Is conceded, Is not altogether apparent. I It ignores Important features of the sit -1 uation, the stability two years' dura- I tion has given to the Insurrection, the ! feasibility of its Indefinite prolongation, |as In the nature of things and as is j shown by past experience; the utter and imminent ruin of the island unless the present strife is speedily composed; I above all, the rank abuses all parties in j Spain, all branches of her government | and all her leading public men concede | to exist and profess a desire to remove, j Failing such circumstances, to with hold the proffer of needed reforms until I the parties demanding them put them . selves at mercy by throwing down their arms has the appearance of neglecting the gravest of perils and inviting sus picion as to the sincerity of any pro fessed willingness to grant reforms. The objection on behalf of tne insur gentsâ€”that promised reforms cannot be relied uponâ€”must of course be con sidered, though we have no right to as sume and no reason for assuming that anything Spain undertakes to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done according to both the spirit and the letter of the undertaking. Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions and precautions on the part of the weak er of the two combatants are always natural and not always unjustifiableâ€” being sincerely desirous in tlie inter ests of both, as well as on Its own ac count, that the Cuban problem should be solved with the least possible delayâ€”lt was Intimated by this government to the government of Spain some months ago that If satisfactory measures of home rule were tendered the Cuban ln i surgents and could be accepted by them upon a guarantee of execution, the United States would endeavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain of fur nishing such guaranty. While no def inite response to this Intimation has yet been received from the Spanish govern ment, it is believed to be not altogether unwelcome, while as already suggested no reason is perceived why it should not be approved by the Insurgents. Neither party can fall to see the Importance of early action and both must realize that to prolong the present state of things for even a short period will add enor mously to the time and labor and expen diture necessary lo bring about the in dustrial recuperation of the island. It is therefore fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for heal ing the breach between Spain and the insurgent Cubans upon the lines above indicated may at once be inaugurated and pushed to an immediate and suc cessful issue. The friendly offices of the United States, either in the manner above mentioned or any other consist ent with our constitution and laws, will always be at the disposal of either part v. Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our interest would con strain us to object to the acquisition of the island or to an Interference with its control by any other power. It should be added that it cannot be reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United states will be Indefinitely maintained. While we are anxious to accord all the respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the pending conflict in all Its fe\ tures, and properly apprehend our in evitably close relations to It and its possible results without considering that by the course of events we may be drawn Into such an unusual and unpre cedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end th* contest either alone and In her own way, or with our friendly co-operation. WMen the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the Insurgents has become manifest and tt is demonstrated that her sovereign ty is extinct in Cuba for purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless struggle for its re-es tablishment has degenerated Into a strife, which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and Ihe utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented In which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be super seded by higher obligations, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and dis charge. Deferring the choice of ways and methods until the time for action ar rives, we should make them depend up on the precise conditions then existing; then they should not be determined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration involving our honor and interest, or the international duty we owe to Spain. When we face the contin gencies suggested, or the situation is by other incidents imperatively changed, we should continue in the line of conduct heretofore pursued; thus In all circum stances exhibiting our obedience to the requirements of public law and our re gard for the duty enjoined upon us by the position we occupy In the family of nations. A contemplation of emergen cies that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation, either through a careless disregard of present duty or even undue stimulation and ill-timed ex pression of feeling. But I have deemed it not amiss to remind the congress that a time may arise when a correct policy and care for our Interests, as well as a regard for the interests of other nations and their citizens, joined by considera tions of humanity and a desire to see a rich and fertile country Intimately re lated to us saved; from complete devas tation, will constrain our government to such action as will subserve the In terests thus involved and- at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants an opportunity to enjoy the blessings of peace. THE 

BOUNDARY QUESTION. The Venzuela boundary question has ceased to be a matter of difference be tween Great Britain and the United States, their respective governments having agreed upon the substantial pro visions of a treaty between Great Brit ain and Venezuela, submitting the whole controversy to arbitration. The provis ions of the treaty are so eminently just and fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto may confidently be anticipated. Negotiations for a treaty of general ar bitration for all differences between Great Britain nnd the United States are far advanced and promise to reach a successful conclusion at an early date. THE CONSULAR SERVICE. The scheme of examining the appli cants for certain consular positions to test their competency and fitness, adopt ed under an executive order issued on the 20th of September, 1895, has fully demonstrated the usefulness of this In novation. In connection with this plan of examination, promotion and transfers of deserving Incumbents have been quite extensively made, with excellent results. During the past year thirty-five ap pointments have been made In the con sular service, twenty-seven of which were made to fill vacancies caus ed by death or resignation, or to supply newly created posts; two to succeed incum bents removed for cause; two for the purpose of displacing alien consular of ficials by American citizens, and four merely changing the official title ot in cumbent from commercial agent to con sul. Twelve of these appointments were transfers or promotions from other posi tions under the department of state; four of those appointed had rendered previous service under the department; eight were made of persons who passed a satisfactory examination; seven were appointed to places not Included in the order of September 20, 1895, and four ap pointments, as above stated, Involved no change of Incumbency. The inspection of consular officers provided for by an appropriation for that purpose at the last session of con gress has been productive of such whole some effects that I hope this important work will in the future bo continued. I know of nothing that can be done with the same slight expense so Improv ing to the service. J desire to repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual message in favor of provid ing, at public expense, ofTieia! residences for our ambassadors and ministers at foreign capitals. Reasons for supporting this recommen dation are strongly stated in the report of the secretary of state, and the sub ject seems of such importance that I hope it may receive the early attention of congress. SEAL EXTERMINATION We have during the past year labored faithfully against unfavorable condi tions to secure better preservation of seal life in the Bering sea. Both the United States and Great Britain have lately dispatched commissioners to these waters to study the habits and conditions of the seal herd and the causes of their rapid decrease. Upon tlie reports of these commissioners, soon to be submitted, and with the exercise of patience and good sense on the part of all interested parties. It Is earnestly hoped that hearty co-operation may be secured for the protection against threatened extermination of seal life in the Northern Pacific and Bering sea.

The number of national banks organ ized from the time the law authorizing their creation was passed up to Oct. 31, 1896, was 5051 .and of this number 3679 were at the date last mentioned in ac tive operation, having an authorized capita, stock of $650,014,896 held by 288, --902 shareholders, and circulation notes amounting to $21, 412.620. The toim outstanding circulation notes of all na tional banks on the 31st day. of October. 1896, amounted to $2.:..552,807, Including unredeemed but fully secured notes of banks Insolvent and in process of liqui dation. The increase in national bank circulation during the year ending cr. that day was $21,099,439. On October 6, 1596, when the condition of national banks was- last reported, the total resources of 3,679 active institu tions was $3,263,685,313.83. which includ ed $1,893,208,839.31 in loans.and discounts, and $302,165,733.85 In money of all kinds on hand. Of their liabilities, $1.590,891. --058.03 was duo to individual depositors and $20,944,019 consisted of outstanding circulating notes. There were organized during the year preceding the date last mentioned 2S national banks, located in 15 states, of which 12 were organized in. the eastern states, with a capital of $1,180,000 ; 6 in western states with a capital of $875, --000, and 10 in the southern states with a capital of $1,190,v00. During the year, however, 30 banks volun tarily abandoned their fran chises under the national law, and in the case of 27 others, it was found ne cessary to appoint receivers. Therefore, as compared with the year preceding, there was a decrease of 36 In the number of active banks. The number of exist ing banks organized under state laws is 5708. IMMIGRATION. The number of immigrants arrived in the United States during the fiscal year was 343,_67, of whom 340,468 were per mitted to land and 2799 were debarred on various grounds prescribed by law and returned to the countries whence they came at the expense of the steam ship company by which they were brought in. The increase in immigra tion over the preceding year amounted to 84,131. It is reported that with some exceptions the immigrants of the past year were of a hardy laboring class, ac customed and able to earn a support for themselT.es, and it is estimated that the mpney brought with them amounted to at least $5,000,000. Though it was probably much In ex* eess of that sum, since only those having less than $30 are required to disclose thÂ» exact amount, and It is known that many brought considerable sums of money to buy land and build homes.
