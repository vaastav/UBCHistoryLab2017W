YANKS AT GRAND PRE USED SCALING LADDER AS IN ANCIENT DAYS v Si f Nature's Landmark. The Devil's Tower is thirty-two miles by road from Moorcroft, Wyo. j This ancieiit mass or rock rises 600 i feet above a rounded ridge of sedi mentary rocks, which itself rises 600 feet above the Belle l'ourche River. It was useful to the aborigines as a landmark from which to direct their courses across the plains. Later on the white pioneers of civil ization in their exploration of the great northwest also used it as a landmark. Still later the military wars in the Sioux and Crow Indian country during the Indian wars of the last century directed their marches by the aid of this ever pres ent tower; for it is visible in some directions for nearly a hundred miles.

It is contended by partisans of Germany and arbitrary pacifists in the allied countries that this is not the German program, but the evidence is overwhelming that it is. tn view of the appalling possibil ities of the outcome, it seems to me not unwise to estimate, according :o the facts already before us, how t'-o'gs will probably shape them selves. It the Germans win it is probable that we shall see a thorough change in the system that has prevailed imon;r the nations. The system of nationalities and empires enjoying more or less equal rights and priv ileges will come to an end.
