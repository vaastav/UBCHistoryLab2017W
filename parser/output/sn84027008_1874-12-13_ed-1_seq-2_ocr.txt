The Ciuoicinati Enquirer hos been -staged in a controvorty with some of -iio Administration journals in regard So <U?e accomplishments of Andrew ?Jackson, and it vehemently resents the accusation that tho old hero was a mau o? either "imperious or boorish man? ners," declaring that "we never had a .President who was more olegant in de? mon nor or impressive in his external appearance." That he was often "im ^wesaive," must be admitted, but the JZw/uirer is slightly mistaken in the farmer'part of the assertion. Nor was "al& Hickory"" vory well informed on many subjects on whioh Grant has also cvincod an abundant lack of informa? tion. Ho know little about interna? tional or evou constitutional law; but 'ie /had one of those happily oonsti ' tated minds whioh go across labyrinths <eC eophietry j and through masses of immaterial faots straight to tho true point. A story is told of him that is tlkiotrative of his oharacter. Daring <&e administration of Mr. Monrre, Jackson, in command of aomo troop3, > invaded Florida, aud auptnred Arbuth aot and Ambristor, two Englishmen f:ho, it was charged, inoited the In? diens to depredations, just as the rarpet-baggcrs now incite negroes to ? riot. Ho at onco ordered a court mar Ciai'aud had them bung, with but .'.Ziffle time to prepare for their future plaoe of abode. Ho was arraigned for <ibc offeuao before the Cabinet of Mr. ZX^nroe, and Mr. Adams, the Secretary f >sZ -State, defended him on tho high . /.prouna of international law as ox :nouadea by Grotius, Vuttol and Puf vecdorf. . Jackson, who had quarreled -srith Mr. Monroe, was disposed to re? gard :ho matter as entirely personal. **E>?n Grotius.; d?n Pufiondorf; d?n Vattel/'eaid he; "this is a mere matter ' oot?7eeu Jim Munroo and me." it is also suid of him that, pondiug :flaa question of dispute between this .senntry nad France in regard to the demand for 35,000,000, his znoseage tu -Congress contained a direct and insult ? 'eg throat to Louis Philippe. The Cabinet consulted and urged a cbaugo ?ol the phraseology. Mr. Forsyth, J-?ior_ .Secretary of State, adroitly skaeged the lauguago dictated by the .President, to soften it and muke the -.neoesage more diplomatic in terms and - store conformable to peaceful and - ienrtoous national intercourse. But .?. when Mr. Djnelson, the President's - private secretary, read to bim from the jacoarVshoets, Jackson stopped bim -erben'he got to the part relating to Franco. "Bead that again, sir," aaid .- he; "that, it ie not my language; it has i beau changed, and I will have no other expression of my own meaning thau xay ofu words." The original words ?rare -substituted, and his absolute dic? tation wrang from Franca the money Urbich never could have been obtained throagfu- diplomacy. .. It is -hardly necessary, however, to tiefend the old warrior from the fre ?.jaeut charges of personal rudeness, zee -to any supposed resemblance ho '.mac-boar to Grant. Ho was an out? growth cf, our honest and robust Ame? rican life. He was as courageous as a 3??doe Indian, resolute, aggressive, bristling with belligerency; bat .what iorperfactions he bad were far more &an redeemed by his oonspiouous and i^ecoio virtues. Gen. Grant has many zf his defeots, but, unfortunately, there the similarity ends. If ho possesses any of tbo old soldier's vir aes, except u bull-dog pertinacity?it that may boc-illed aviitue?he has suc? cessfully concealed them from the world, and, ibo Louisville Courier fourmd fears, ho will die and leave us in ignorance of bis possession. -?-??-?

Tiie President's Views on South? ern Afi'a ins and Finance.?Tho New Yurk Journal of Commerce has tho most solid and scrutinizing article on tho President's message that wo huve seen. The Journal refers to tho expo? sition of .ho President's views towards the South, uud says: "So caudid man denies thut it is tbo President's duty to enforce lows of Congress and tho provisions of the Constitution 'with rigor,' (to Uschis own words,) when circumstances ren? der that necessary. Wo blame the President, uot for enforcing tho l ?ws, but for using the whole power ol his oflicu, and the army with it, to bolster np a parry ut tho South. Ho has never appeared on the scene as a judge to ,ir bit ritte between two contending fac? tious, but always us au advocate ready to hack up his urgumeuts for bis side with bayonets." What ho says of the South is. us ubuuj, the Journal holds, ouo-sided. He repeats the oid stories about "white leagues," masked aud armod. to deprive citizens of the freedom of tho ballot by violence and intimida? tion, and snys^the Journal: "But he has not a word to nay of the formidable and murderous combina? tions of blacks who roamed over parts j of the ?onth, murdering, outraging j and robbing, and causing a reigu of terror which the whites could ouly suppress by couuter-movemeuts. There are two very distinct sides to this ques? tion. If there were white leagues, theru were also black leagues, whose crimes mado leagues of uuothor color necessary in the opinion of some of tho best citizens of tho South." Concerning the President's views on finance, the Journal says; ''But whatever his opinions on Linauco may bo intrinsically worth, they have no binding power on Con? gress, and really carry but little weight. They have uo uioro tlTeot than those of uny other mnu who 1ms supcrncially studied financial questions through other men's spectacles, unless it is un? derstood that he would veto every other plan of relief that might be adopted but his own. Tho President j as good as declares that In* is not ob? stinate or tenacious ou thut point, for he says: 'It i:i Ihn d'ily of Congress to devise the method of cor roc ling the evils which are acknowledged to ?xi.st, and not mine,' Tho Secretary of tbo Treasury use:-, language to the same effect, aud adds: 'The Socrotary can do neither more nor less than obey ami execute such laws as Congress mat/ enact.' These we tako to be distinct intima? tion.* that tho Adtni?istr?tiou will not quarrel with tho Congressional ma? jority, whutover they do about the finances. In truth, all tbo financial I recommendations of tins President nud j the Secretary wero intended for p >pn lar effect, and not us outgivings of an ' ?tdminiatrutiou policy to be executed j with rigor uud firmness." ; The Hsdioitl papers are slid discuss? ing the future policy of lue Demo? cratic party, und uro foreshadowing the gravest porils to thr> State in con nequo.ico of its triumph. Of course, tney don't behove anything of the kind. The only "porils" which will re? sult will be to tho Radical party, und their gravity canuot be over-estimated. Tho disclosures of Bidioul corruption will bo fearful. Besides, nn a very in? telligent gentleman of Virginia ex? pressed it, tho Democracy will inflict upou tho Radicals "what they dread more than war, pestilence and fa? mine?the Constitution of the United States." Tai! Tu ans: r OF Yen es. ? Telegrams from various aoarces report the suo? oeaalol. observation of the transit of Venus. The elaborate and coBtly ex? peditions sent to so many points of earth, to note tho movement of the planet as it passes aaross tbe centre of tbo solar systotu, provokes inquiry as to the object. Tbe Baltimore Ameri? can gives i be reason briefly, tbus: "Tho primary object is to ascertain tho distauce of the sun front the earth, which, once fixed, will eua'ole us to de? termine the dist luce of all the various members of the planetary system from the earth and lrom each other, even to I I that of Neptnup, so far removed that j I one of itn dnyj is n cyclo of our years, ! whilst the warmth')! the rays of the 'situ never r.aiohos its perpetual ice an.1. I suow. Onr distauce from the sun is u I yard-stick for measuring other celes? tial distance!', and when that is once definitely knowu, wu have a positive basis to go upon fcr measuring space. Tbo preliminary trouble i* tbut there i are millions of miles of difference in | tho various estimates of the distauce I between the earth aud tbe suu. The j ancient astronomers fixed it at 0,000, 000 of miles; but Eucke calculated i'. at 05,000,000, which has been the com? mon acceptation up to tho preseut time. But tho object to bo attained is absolute certainty, and tbu supposi? tion is that tho modern perfection of science would attain this from the ob? servations of tho recent transit of Venus. It is tho claim of scientists that it will euuble them tc arrive at certainty in their work, and demon? strate it to the popular comprehen? sion. Uudcr such conditions, it is not difficult to uuderstuud the value of these obsnrvatiots." The first observation of the transit was iu 1G30 by Jeremiah Horbachs, a young astronomer. Tbo crudj man? ner of his proceeding is thus told: "He darkeued his room and 1- t in sunlight on u sheet of white paper, through an aperture in a window ..but? ter. It was Sunday, aud tbe pious us tronomcr watched his paper till it was time to go to church. This duty be would uot neglect, although another opportunity to witness tbe trauet of Venus, and demonstrate the wisdom of somoyenrs' study and labor, he knew, would not be offered for n century. Koturuiug from church iu tbe after noou, ho resumed his observation, and tbus describes what followed: "At this time an opeuiug in tbe clouds, which reudernd the miu dihtiuutly visible, seemed hs if Divine Provideue?) en? couraged my aspirations, when, ob! most gratifying spectacle, tbe object of so inauy earnest wishes! I perceived a new spot of unusual maguitude. and perfectly round, which bad just en? tered on tho left limb of the sou.' " With tho parfected instrumentation of the present day the desired object seems to have boon obtained, and us-j trouomy, whieh i.s said to bavo "stood j still for a thousand years, from Ptolemy J to Kopier, hiu at last made a step for- j ward which may astonish, benefit and oulightcu the world. Tho observations of the tram-it in j various parts of tbo world on Tuesday seem to have been atteuded in several localities, as was naturally to be ex? pected, with disadvantages, and iu one loculity, at least, none could be made at all. Prof. Hall, chief of the Ame? rican expedition in Siberia, in a de? spatch from tbe station ut Vladivostok, says that clouds nbsenred the sun from dawn until ueur the arrival of the critical moment, when all became bright, and, as tbe plauet advanced aud touched the sun's limb, the mo? ment wm signuled with accuracy; but owing to tho drifting of haze and clouds between it was impossible to obtain pood photographs oi the con? tact. The moment of the second con? tact wan obtained, however, although tho vapory ?tute of tbo atmosphere continued. When Venus had crept nearly half way ccross the solar dif.o tho huzo disappeared sufficiently to admit of photographic images being taken. Thirteen negatives were exe? cuted, so that it will be possible to map the truck of tbe plauet on the photographic image of tbe sun. Prof. David.um, chief astronomer of the American '-xpedition to Nagasaki, ro ports that cloudy weather prevented an exact record of tbe moment of first contact, but the second was obtained with accuracy, aud also about '200 mi crometric measurements iu tbe course of the observations. About sixty ex? cellent photographs were tiiken of the transit, aud the results aro considered successful. Tbo English parties iu ; Egypt report favorable observations of only tbocloaiug stages of the phoneme-1 non at Cairo and Kmv,. and perfect snccoss at Thebes, where tho artists j obtained excellent pictures t.f the journey of the plauet over the suit's face. The objorvatiou at Teheran, Persia, is reported as very successful. At Shauhui tho English astronomer bed nothing but clouds to gaze at, and no observation at all could bo made. Tho Engl iah observations iu various parts of India, however, were a per-i feet success. Tins Amoricau observa? tion.'; at llobart Town, Van Diemuu's Land, only partly succeeded. It will, \ of course, be months .yet before the ? final results of tbo observations urol figured out, and uutil then wo must] regard with patience tbe present uu- ; certainty with which tho distauce of j our solar luminary and co-ordiuato [ conundrums are surrouudt <-??-?

Hu had an inter? view with a correspondent of the Chi? cago Tribune, from the report of which we copy: "Their women of the supcuor fami? lies," said Hnrt<\ "anrpasa ours in real intriusicstreugth, und are very far supe? rior to t'Hoir men. I never hoard such English spoken us at some of tho pri? vate houses I visited. Propriety with? out frigidity, and a classical amiability met me very frequently. At the sumn time, aomo of tho littie conveuieneea, without which we could uot get along, are wholly absent, from households, otherwise very pert eel. Their cuisine might he remedied.

Harte thought that '?no evil of the South was the surplus ?>! political dis? cussion. The" press was uot enough a news press, but redundant in contro? versy ami pulitieal pen.onulity.
