THETIMES. PORT TOBACCO, MD., Dec. 6, I 87. ; P—U mt Hmfr William B. Stone. It becomes our sad duty to announce the death of Major William B. Stone, of this county. He died at hia residence, near this place, on Sunday last, the Ist instant, of an affection of the brain, under which he bad been suffering for several months past. Majqr Stone was the son of Judge Michael Stone, once Chief Justice of this Judicial District, and a nephew of Thomas Stone, Signer of the Declaration of Inde pendence. Like his distinguished uncle and father, he was trained to the law; and practiced with reputation, and successfully, until 1844. In that year he was nominat ed as Chief Judge of this District by Gov ernor Francis Thomas, and served until 1848. Hir political opponents being in thumajority in the Senate, and having the Governor, his appointment was not con firmed, when he retired from the practice. Sinqe that time he has been entirely engag ed in agricultural pursuits, except on on*e occasion. In 1855 he and the late Senator Merrick were nominated by the Democratic party for the Legislature, and after a long and laborious canvass were elected in the last struggle made by the old Whig party in the county. With his colleague Major Stone served the county ably and faithful ly in the Legislature, and after his term of service altogether retired from public life. In all the relations of life Major Stone furn ished an example worthy of imitation. He was an exemplary husband and father; a kind and affectionate relative; a social and hospitable gentleman; a kind and charita ble neighbor, and. above all, he was a con sistent Christian. Thus are passing away, one by one, the men who were, prominent in the profes sions, and as business and public men,when we first came to Charles county. Soon none will be left. A great change has bpsp made in the social condition of our people since they grew up and lived—a change, we fear, which will not be favora ble to the development of such a class of men in the future. Let us, then, treasure their memories, and imitate their virtues, that their characters may assist in mould ing, as far as possible, those who will suc ceed them in the places and duties of-life. : Congress. Both Houses of the Forty-third Congress met oh Monday last. The usaal joint committee was appointed to wait upon the President, who sent in his Annual Mes sage, an interesting synopsis of which will be found in another column. There has been, so far, but litile business transacted in either, branch. Mr. Sumner offered a bill in the Senate on Monday to erase from the Army Registers and regimental colors the names of battles fought in the late war. As also endeavored to get his Supplemen ts Civil Rights bill before the Senate, aaid gave notice that he would call it up * t the earliest possible moment. Mr. Bbnks, fit the- House, offered his resigna tion as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on account of his differ ences with the administration, but the House refused to accept it. In the same body on Wednesday a resolution of inves tigation into the manner the Board of Public Works of Washington have been spending money in public improvements, was offered by Mr. Roosevelt, and by a de cisive vote referred to the committee on the District, in which Mr. Roosevelt de clared it would be “effectually smothered.” Electoral Tote of Maryland The Maryland Electors for President and Vice President assembled in the Sen ate Chamber, at Annapolis, on Wednesday. The Hon. Frederick Raine was chosen president of the College, and Augustus Gassaway, Esq., secretary. The Governor was -duly notified of the organization of the College, and the credentials were prop erty certified. A brief address from the chair followed. At its close—the motion to. proceed to ballot being next in order —the Hon. A. W. Bradford nominated Thomas A Hendricks; of Indiana, as the choke of Maryland for President of the United States, and when the ballots were cast and.

PORT TOBACCO TIMES. AND CHARLES COUNTY ADVERTISER, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6. 1872. The Maryland State Loan. The Treasury. Department and the Gov ernor have Accepted bids sold a suffi cient amount of the new loan, known as “The Maryland State Loan” (all of which was disposed pf above par), to redeem all of the overdue currency bonds of 1865 and 1.870. The Comptroller has given public notice that this cla?s pf overdue stock is redeemable at the Treasurer’s office, An napolis; and that the interest thereon will cease after the first day of January, 1873. This concludes, for the present, and probably for some time, any transactions m “The Maryland State Loan,” which loan ia solely designed to take the place of the overdue stock and bonds of the State not outstanding, and is not a loan to increase the indebtedness of the State. ■ : JSPThe ceremony of unveiling the sta tue of the late Chief Justice Taney will take place at Annapolis on Tuesday next the 10th instant, at 10 o’clock. The pre sentation address will be delivered in the Senate chamber by S. Teackle Wallis, Esq. The statue is in bronze, by Rinehart, and is the first work of the kind ever ordered by the State of Maryland. - 5aP f *The trial of the young man Jesse W. Uppercue on the charge of having mur dered his aged aunt, Mrs. Amelia Wheat, at her residence, No. 646 West Lombard street, Baltimore, on the morning of the 26th day of August last, was commenced . before his Honor Judge Gilmore in the Criminal Court of Baltimore on Monday. Drowned. On Friday. last, two young men, one named Pfeiffer, and the other Willett, ac companied by a colored man whose name we could not learn, started from Lower Cedar Point in a yawl boat to catch a small boat which was adrift on the Poto mac. The yawl was capsized and two of the party held on to it and drifted ashore. Pfeiffer, who either attempted to swim to the shore or was thrown too far from the yawl to save himself, was drowned. We understand Pfeiffer was a nephew of Mr. Peter Dill, the owner of the Cedar Point t , property, and a promising youth of 18 years of age. The Southern Hafutne.

Horace Greeley, after a short illness, - breathed bis last at about half-past six o’- s clock on Friday evening last, the 29th ult. i The papers are filled with comments up -1 on the life, character and eminent abilities 1 of this great journalist. - It is a sad event 3 which we here briefly record and one that s has caused deep regret wherever the intel ligence has reached. His funeral took i place in New York on Wednesday, when , an immense concourse attended and every i mark of respect was shown the deceased, 3 who had been among the foremost men of i the country. Forgetting past differences, 3 as we determined to do when we advocat t ed the election of Mr. Greeley to the Presi s ency, we now feel deep and sincere regret at the sudden termination of a life which promised so much good for the future of our country. We had hoped his life • would have been spared, and with his ’ giant intellect have aided in bringing a bout the reforms in our political system " which he so ably advocated within the • past few months. But God has decreed 1 it otherwise; and we are taught in this * O 1 dispensation to look to Him for help. We copy the following beautiful and 3 touching notice of Mr. Greeley’s death from the Washington hronicle : When one short month since Mr. Greeley ’ followed 4 the tomb one who bore to him 1 the dear relation of wife—the mother of 3 his children—the marked contrast between j the living and the dead gave little indica tion of the event just announced. The at -3 tenuated form of the dead gave evidence • of a long and weary struggle with disease. Mrs. Greeley had long been an invalid.— The shadow of the dread visitor had pre -3 pared the household, in a measure, for the . event they so vainly sought to put in the a distance. But the roseate health of the veteran journalist, his unconquerable r spirit, his remarkably prudent life, all i seemed to promise a protracted stay and a . vigorous age. To .all appearance consti tutional vigor was unimpaired. Within a few weeks he had outstripped agile • youth in climbing the steep acclivities of ) his native State. He had spoken of a 3 possible return in the distant future to the 3 scenes of his childhood, the home of his youth. Whatever might be the result of • the impending conflict he felt assured of t a welcome and a final resting place among j his kindred. If he had erred he knew that his mistakes would be forgiven by those who needed not to be told what had been the spring of his private and public life. He had sought to make the world 3 something wiser and better for his labors. ■ While there was something of sadness at 3 times in his utterances, as a general thing t buoyancy of spirit was his peculiar char acteristic, and few were prepared to be -3 lieve that a poignant sorrow could bear f him to the earth. Yet it is impossible to j avoid the belief that his private affliction . and public disaster preyed upon him with 1 a power he could not resist. He took up 1 the pen he had so recently dropped and ■ his accustomed place at the editorial desk, ; thinking he could take up the thread of t his uncompleted work and weave on as of yore. The spirits he evoked obeyed him not. A few flashes there were of the won -1 ted fire. But, as his associate tells us, f Richard was not himself again. The wea t ry spirit craved rest, but even that would , not come, short of the grave. The tension had been too great. The elasticity of r spirit and nerve was gone. The bow had : been strung too severely. The chord snap i ped. Weary nature cried “It is finished.” ’ The dying man repeated, with his latest breath, “’tis done.” There was an exultant strain, just be fore the last, when the perturbed spirit ■ found momentary quiet. “I know that imy Redeemer liveth!” was the testimony i and the hope of the dying journalist.— p Those who have been accustomed to re gard Mr. Greeley as an unbeliever, have ing no fixed faith, will rejoice that the greatest of American journalists sought rest where alone it can be found. He had tried many spirits and knocked at many doors that he might enter into the light. Retracing his steps at last he sought and found his Father’s house. All else had failed him. The delusive phantom of Presidential honor he had pursued with almost childish eagerness, eluded his grasp. The tender ministrations of his wife were to be his no more. The journ ■ alistic monument he had built was not to receive the capstone at his hand. He must leave the shaft, as it seemed to him, unfinished. The light shone not upon the pathway of self-appointed labor. But it was permitted to him at last, it would seem, to realize supreme contentment in the bow of promise that spans the highest life. “I know that my Redeemer liveth,” he exclaimed, and in this there was a peaceful calm the tempestuous winds of disappointment could not disturb. The paroxysm of unrest had passed. The mind resumed its normal state. He rec ognized and spoke to friends. He seemed fully conscious of his own condition, and sunk to his rest without a pang or a sigh. There is ground for profound satisfac tion in the fact that the delirum attending his illness passed away, and that there was coherency in his thoughts and words at the last. We shall think more pleas antly of the closing scenes, vindicating, as they did, the deeper convictions of a nature peculiarly thoughtful and inquisi tive. ■ . ■ ■■ How Chromos Are Made* Probably very few, even of those persons who are generally well informed, have the slightest conception of the various proces ses by which those wonders of modem im i itative |art, popularly known as Chromos, are gradually developed, step by step, to a perfection which almost defies discrimi nation in comparing with the original.— 1 The lithographic, or stone process, is that , generally used in this country; but having ! been found too slow, and inherently defec tive for rendering some of the most deli . cate tints, great effort has been adem to • find a substitute, by which a higher de , gree of perfection could be attained,, and the superior productive capacity of relief substituted for the uncertainties and de lays of surface printing. Many years ago, Mr. Charles Stahl, a lithographic engraver of high repute, di rected' his attention to this subject* and 1 afteFyears-.of patient and enthusiastic fte ivotion,he has overcome all difficulties, and has so perfected his process as to in , sure a complete revolution in the art oi . color printing. Messrs, James Sutton & Co., of 58 Mai den Lane, New York, publishers of The Aldine, adopted his-prbeess for the produc i tion of their Premium Chromos, some three t years ago; and, with the increased facili k ties thus placed at his disposal, Mr. Stahl has been enabled to achieve the most ad mirable results, and*the firm are now print - ing Chromos, equal in every respect to the i very best foreign specimens. r The picture to be copied is covered with a transparent sheet of oiled paper, on ’ which a tracing of every outline is made. E" This outline is then transferred to a litho , graphic stone, known as the “Key.” A number of plates, equal ‘to the number ol tints desired, is next prepared, and an im pression from the Key is printed on each, t With the original before him, the artist i fills in with a crayon such portions of the f outline on each plate as he wishes to have , reproduce the particular shade assigned ' to it. 5 The untouched portions of the plate are - then covered with a peculiar preparation, i an d a galvanic bath nicely governed, does , the work of an engraver, but does it as no ' engraver could possible do it—true to a E hair, and finer, if necessary, than the na -5 ked eye can discover. Each plate is print ed in its turn on the paper, and every im , pression must be so adjusted to its prede cessors, that there shall not be the slight -1 est variation. When it is considered that as many as r twenty or thirty plates are often required i —that some portions of a tint are preserv [• ed pure to the end, while others are cover [ ed and affected by one or all succeeding im . pressions—the marvelous skill and knpwl . edge of various combinations of color re , quired of an artist who essays to lay out and complete the- plates for a Chromo, . may be faintly imagined by those who see and admire the splendid results of his la , hours. In The Aldine establishment may be , seen two immense Gottrel & Babcock prin , ting machines, selected for their accuracy of register and perfect distribution.— These presses are constantly occupied in printing the Chromos to be given as pre miums to subscribers to The Aldine for ; 1873. " The process of relief printing has, a , mong many, this very important advantage , over lithography: the printing is not from i surface transfers —never perfect, and con i' tinually demanding renewal — but directly • from the engraving itself, which, being on . hard metal, will qpt wear out. Persons who are satisfied’ with the specimens shown, may be assured that the copies they get will be even better, as practice i constantly improves the adjustment of the colors. Since The Aldine originated the plan of giving subscribers Chromos free, nearly every paper of any pretension has adopted the idea, and many things called Chromos have been extensively advertised and puff ed all over the country. The well-known artistic standard of The Aldine was a guar antee that its Premium Chromos would be everything that thejmpst fastidious could desire; and the spSuneis of “The Village Belle” and “Crossing the Moor,” now be fore us, fully justify every expectation. ■ The superior facilities of the publishers • enable them to deliver a large edition of these Chromos to subscribers immediately, and they can keep pace with a demand e qual to 20,000 pairs per month from Jan uary. It is estimated that before June Ist, o ver 2,500,000 impresssions will be printed • on each of these Chromos, which would give 100,000 pairs. Such an edtion of Chromos of such a grade and size(l4 x 20 inches each), is an utterly unheard-of thing, and a year ago would have caused our slower cousins across the water to laugh at the projector as a fool. But this is not a country of precedents; it is ouly asked—is the thing possible ? and presto ! American enterprise does it! From the Baltimore Gazette. The President’s Message. The message commences with an expres sion of thankfulness for the blessing of peace and prosperity at home, and peace with foreign Powers. The first subject re ferred to is the satisfactory adjustment of the Alabama claims by arbitration, at Ge neva —Mr. Adams and the United States counsel being complimented for the servi ces they rendered. For the distribution of the award, when paid, a Board of Com missioners is recommended. The settle ment of the boundary question, by the de cision of the Emperor of Germany—trans ferring the island of San Juan to the United States—is next made a source of congratulation, as a final and definitive adjustment of all boundary disputes be tween the United States and Great Britain. It is now suggested that the actual line between Alaska and the British possession be surveyed and marked by appropriate natural objects or monuments. On the subject of the fisheries-the Message states that as the British Parliament and the Canadian have passed laws to carry out the pro , \yb?ns of the Treaty of Washington, is asked of Congress at an early day. The total ordinary receipts of the Trea sury for the fiscal year ending June 30, are put at $364,794,229 25. Receipts from sale of coin at $9,412,587 65, making the total net receipts $374,100,867 56. Adding to the above, the balance in the Treasury on June 30, 1871, of $109,935,705 70, the total available cash in the Treasury was $484,- 842,573 15. The total of net disbursements for the same period, was $377,476,216 21, leaving a balance in the Treasury on the 30th June, 1872, of $106,574,356 94. The net reduc tion of the principal of the public debt during the fiscal year was $99,960,253 54. The total reduction from March 1,1869, to March 1, 1872, was $368,696,499 87. The message expresses a doubt as to whether any further reduction of taxation is advis able for the present, and recommends that no more legislation be had on the subject except to correct errors of omission or commission in the present laws. The expenditures of the War Depart , ment for the fiscal year were $35,372,157 20, a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year i of $427,834 62. The estimates for the next fiscal year are $32,801',378 78. During the fiscal year there has been paid for trans portation on railroads over $1,300,000, of which $800,857 was over the Pacific rail-1 road. For transportation by water $626,- j 373 62, and by stage $48,975.84, and for the purchase, of transports, animals, wag- j ons, pay of teamsters, etc., $924,660 64. — - About $370,000 have been collected from f Southern railroads during the year, leav ; ing about $4,000,000 still due. The Quar -; termaster has examined and transmitted e ] to the accounting officers for settlement !-1 $3,671,727 28 of claims by loyal citizens e for quartermaster’s stores taken during the i- war. Subsistence supplies to the amount il of $89,048 12 have been issued to Indians [- The annual average mean strength of the army was 14,101 white and 2,494 colored e soldiers. The total deaths for the year re ported were 367 white and 54 colored, h Attention is called to the various pro n jects which will be laid before Congress i. for the cheaper transportaion of the pro i- ducts of the West and South to the Atlan k. tic sea board. One route to connect the <t Mississippi Valley with the Atlantic, at i- Charleston, S. C., and Savannah, Ga., by i. the way of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers t and canals and slack water navigation to e the Savannah and Ogeechee rivers, has e been surveyed. Second and third new i routes will be proposed for the considera tion of Congress, namely, by an expansion e of the Kanawha and James River Canal to i, the Ohio, and by the extension of the Ches s apeake and Ohio Canal. But the Presi -0 dent is not prepared to recommend Gov a eminent aid until it is shown that such - enterprises are of national interest. He ■* suggests that a commission be appointed - which shall be authorized to take the - whole question of cheap transportation - into consideration. He also suggests the propriety of examining and reporting 3 upon the practicability of opening an al -1 most continuous line of navigable water - communication from Maine to the Gulf of - Mexico, as an internal improvement which - would be of inestimable value in case of -a foreign war. The Report of the Secretary of the Na t vy is briefly referred to, and his sugges , tions recommended to the careful consid j eratiou of Congress. Next in order comes a synopsis of the doings of the Postoffice Department. The 3 receipts were $21,915,426 37; the expendi tures $26,658,192 31. The favorable con r sideration of Congress is asked to the - recommendation of the Postmaster Gener i al for an increase of service from monthly - to semi-monthly trips on the mail steam r ship route in Brazil, for a subsidy in aid of the establishment an of American line -of mail steamers between San Francisco, 5 New Zealand and Australia, for the estab i lishment of postoffice saving banks, and - for an increase of the salaries of the heads r of bureaus. i The President repeats his former recom i mendation for abolishing the banking pri i vilege accorded the national banks; but, 5 believing that Congress will not adopt his ! opinion on the subject, suggests that the * privilege be so modified as to correct its glaring and costly abuses. He also recom i mends the purchase of all the telegraph lines now in operation, and connecting [ this service with the postal service. He i also asks that liberal contracts be author ized for carrying the mails by the Pacific i Mail Steamship Company; the United States and Brazil line; and the California, ! New Zealand and Australian line, these being the only three lines plying between ! the United States and foreign ports which are operated under our flag. The next paragraph of the message re ■ fers to the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which, it is stated, “will show an alarming falling off in our carrying trade for the last ten years, and even for the past year.” The only remedy indirect ly suggested for this state of things is, that Congress shall grant subsidies to the amount of five millions of dollars a year for five years, to the owners of vessels fly ing the United States flag, and trading [ with foreign ports. Congress is asked to give this matter its serious consideration. Under the head of the Department of Pub lic Justice, the Ku-Klux and Enforcement i laws are touched upon, and are declared to have been salutary in their operation. To those Southerners now sentenced to hard labor at Albany Penitentiary, for al leged violations of these latvs, the hope is held out that, at some future day, their cases will be considered. The affairs of the several bureaus con ’ nected with the Department of the Interi or are said to be in a satisfactory condi tion, and the policy adopted at the begin ' ning of the administration in regard to the Indians declared to have been successful in reducing the expenses of management and decreasing the number of Indian for ays upon white settlers. The.proposition to settle, by degrees, the Indian tribes upon the reservation south of Kansas, and organize there a Territorial form of gov ernment, is favorably commented on; but it is deemed necessary, in such event, that ' the Indians should be protected against the encroachments of the whites, and pre vented from disposing of their lands until sufficiently civilized to guard their own rights. The message next treats of the sale of public lands, puts the receipts of the land Office at $3,218,100, and gives estimates of the number of acres, surveyed and unsur veyed, remaining unsold. A brief statement of the workings of the Patent Office is given, but it contains no thing ol special interest. The payments of pensions amounted to $80,109,340 last year; an increase of $6,708,434 over the year preceding. The whole number of soldiers enlisted during the war is estima the at 2,688,523 ; the total number of claims for invalid pensions at 176,000; but the grand total of jiensioners on the rolls on the 30th of June, 1872, was 232,229. The remaining topics discussed are the Bureau of Education; the Territories; the unsatisfactory condition of affairs in Utah; the District of Columbia, with recommen dations of an appropriation by Congress to pay for certain public improvements; the Report of the Commissioner of Agri culture; the Centennial Anniversary; and finally, the Civil Service. The new rules regulating the tenure of office, it is intim ated, will be enforced, and Congress is asked to make the system binding by luw upon future Presidents. jpW’Qne of the mules, the property of the county, was found dead-in Port To bacco yesterday morning. Whether it ; died of the prevailing epizootic, with I which it is said to have been recently suf fering, or from some other cause, it is not certainly known. The mule was found in , a narrow alley, its throat being caught be | tween the sharp-pointed palings of a fence, whhrC.it-died -probably from strangula ! tion. U Familiar Letter. Springfield, 111., Nov. 28 th, 1872. d Dear Times: —A short time previous to the late and last Presidential election, 1 e had prepared a letter for you, which I then it neglected to send; and as it was somewhat s. political in its character, enthusiastically ® exhorting my former friends and fellow citizens to stand strong and firm, staunch and true in the interest of that cause which >- alone, in my estimation, could give any 18 hope or encouraging prospect for the main _ tenance of the civil liberties of our coun e trymen in the future, after the great Elec t tive Franchise day it became painfully ap y parent to me that such a letter would be 0 decidedly “inappropos,” and so I burned s it, and am now writing you another, not v that I wish to have anything to say upon the present situation political. It has been y said: Vox Populi, Vox Dei; and as one who . still feels a lingering spark of pure and - well descended patriotism burning within, I could honestly hope that the Mighty * Ruler is indeed controling the destinies of j our country; and that though we, with e very limited and finite vision, may fail to 1 see clearly the wisdom of the working; yet, when we shall have passed through ’ this dark season of the spittle and the clay, r our eyes may be opened, indeed, to behold f our country rising to a higher destiny, and * her name to an excelsior exaltation. This is Thanksgiving Day—a day in the . which a nation is on its knees before the - Lord. If I were a cynic I might say, yes • Eat less turkey and thank God more, and it will be better for you, (speaking of the 3 nation,) but I am happy to be able to say - that lam not churlish. My country! C> ■ my country! “with all thy faults I love thee ' still.” Go in, then, my countrymen, eat } and stuff, and laugh at him who first cries - out—l’ve got enough. "The people here are i preparing to do the day in such a manner 3 as that it shall lose none of its pristine ’ prestige. In a few hours a turkey, with 1 all the usual concomitant dishes, will be 3 smoking upon nearly every table in Spring field, and while many may fail to truly . thank God for His mercy and loving kind , ness, the man that has still room for the 3 plum-pudding, that inevitable sequence to a 3 thanksgiving turkey, will have abundant reason, I think, to praise the Lord for capa i city. Business operations are in the main r , suspended, the people are well disposed ! and amiable, and the present auspices are , favorable for a day that will live long in the hearts of many as one of true enjoy , ment. And now I am admonished that before I can make my usual dignified and respect able appearance at the table, which I ex pect to adorn, it will be necessary to make sundry changes in my present personel— ablution, a change of raiment, &c., will now require the intervening hours. With the wish that the day may pass no more , to you than I think it will to : your correspondent, I will now close this short and uninteresting page of verbiage. N. B. H. The Great Pictorial Annual.

In addition to an admirable medical treatise on the causes, prevention and cure of a great variety of diseases, it embraces a large amount of information interesting to the merchant, the mechanic, the miner, the farmer, the planter, and professional man ; and the calculations have been made for such meri dians and latitudes as are most suitable or a correct and comprehensive National Calendar. The nature, uses and extraordinary sanitary effects of Hostetter’s Stomach Bitters, the staple tonic and alterative of more than half the Chris tian world, are fully set forth in its pages, which are also interspersed with pictorial illus trations, valuable recipes for the household and farm, humorous anecdotes, and other instruc tive and amusing reading matter, original and selected. Among the Annuals to appear with the opening of the year, this will be one of the most useful, and may be had for the asking.— The proprietors, Messrs. Hostetter and Smith, Pittsburgh, Pa., on receipt of a two cent stamp, ■ will forward a copy by mail to any person who cannot procure one in his neighborhood. The ■ Bitters are sold in every city, town and village and are extensively used throughout the entire civilized world. Cupid’s Ambuscade.—The sly archer, Love, shoots his arrows from many coigne of vantage, but it is doubtful if he delivers his heart-taking shafts from any ambush with more effect than when he aims them from the braids and folds and ringlets of a superb head of hair. Ladies who have not been favored by Nature with this crowning charm of womanhood, can readily and certainly increase the volume of their hair and impart to it a silken lustre by using Lyon’s Kathairon as a daily dressing; while those whom Providence has blessed with a superabundance of this “Glory” of the sex, can preserve it, undiminished, in quantity and undiminished in beauty to the latest period of life. There is a germinating principle in the Kathairon which literally compels the hair to grow. It extirpates scurf, dandruff, and all ex foliations and excresences of the scalp which in terfere with the rapid and healthy development of the fibers. Coughs, Bronchitis and Consump tion, in its early stages, nothing equals Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery.
