It only remains to engross and sign the treaty. That will be done two or three days." Contuins Little Outside Protocol. The members of the commissions say the treaty will contain little outside of the scope of the Washing-ton protocol and the matters directly based thereon, like the provisions for the evacuation of the ceded territories, the transfer of public property therein, and guarantees of the safety of the property and rights of the Spanish citizens remaining there. The details of the last class of ques tions covered by the statement which tlie Americans handed to Senor Mon tero Uios at the last meeting were con sidered Thursday, but all tlie commis sioners refuse to divulge tlie details of the conference. Several points upon which thev were unable to agree were left open ior dip lomatic negotiations. The Spaniards refuse to admit that they had failed to respect former treaties guaranteeing-religious free dom in the Caroline islands, cr that there was a necessity for new guaran tees. .- Extreme Politeness. The conclusion of the work was, ac cording to the commissioners, marked by politeness and all outward evidences of good feeling and relief at the fact that the task was accomplished. SVhen all the propositionsi had been discuussed, Judge Day, president of the American commission, remarked: ''There seems to be nothing more to do but engross and sign the treaty."

Sen ator Vest (.Mo.) saici: "I (lo not want to be captious about thin pension business and do not want to set myself up as a reformer, but this thing of passing a lot ol: pensidn bills simply by the reading of the titles, and when a ciuorum of the senate is not present, has got to be stopped." Alter further referring to the meth ods by wlncli pension bills are passed by the senate, Senator Vest Said: I "Men of the south have sat here and per I nutted these bills to be passed, having .some delicacy about entering objections to the course of procedure. Recent events have obliterated sectionalism, and we are united. We can therefore come here and object to this spoliation, and 1 use the word advisedly, without fear of having our mo tives impugned or our words misconstrued. We ara paying out in round figures 5141, 000,000 annually for pensions, and It is our duty to iind out why it is that, 33 years aft er the close of the civil war, this thing of pension claims shows so enoimous a sum. I have been criticised by some of my people litcausj I have not taken a more deter mined stand on this pension question, 1 want, however, to pay munificently and liberally in pensions. I regard such pay ment as a sacred duty, but 1 do object to tlie passage of these bills without proper consideration and without the same restric tions that are hedged about oilier meas ures." Senator Gallinger (X. H.), as chair man of the pension committee, agreed with Senator Vest in his desire to have the pension bills carefully considered, lie thought a quorum of the senate ought to be in attendance when the pension calendar was considered.
