In President Wilson's message to congress, -which began the short ses sion Tuesday, he spoke of the future and the important problems which -congress Is called upon to solve. The prediction 4s made, however, that the present Democratic congress will not attempt to do very much besides passing appropriation bills, but will wait until March next, when the new congress meets for the long session. The Democratic majority in the pres ent congress has cot, apparently, much confidence in its ability to push through to a successful result any sreat or pressing national enter prise at this time. The most important and practical art8 of Mr. Wilson's message relate co the American merchant marine, to securing ships by which our for eign commerce may be enlarged, and to the "demands" of the army and navy and their commercial allies for a "great army" and "a greater navy." To secure sufficient ships for American ocean commerce, the presi dent recommends the passage of the pending shipping bill, which was dis cussed in the last congress but passed neither house. This is the subsidy bill authorizing the government to buy enough vessels to start an American chipping service on the high seas—a measure similar to the proposed government ownership and. operation of railroads on land. Mr. Wilson says that after ocean trans portation is once provided for, and reasonable rates established, private capital will induced to continue the business and the government can withdraw its support from subsidies. This i3 a national undertaking in volving the most radical changes in our governmental policy, and is open co many objections but the presi dent is willing to try it. It can cer tainly be no less disastrous than the spending of millions allowed in the river and harbor bill for improving uavigation on streams which nature never intended as waterways. The president is opposed to a great army, and says that it is not neces sary, nor ever will be, for our na tional defense. We have the means at hand in our citizen soldiery, the potential militia of the nation, with out turning the country into an armed caA)p and asking our best young men to «pend the best years of their lives in soldiering. He urg es the training, equipment and prep aration of a sufficient militia in all the states as an adequate means of national defense for any internal emergency. As to the navy, he declares that -we already have a powerful bulwark on the seas and expect to continue it —but not for offense or for provoca tion. But, asked the president, "who shall tell us now what sort of a navy to build?" How do the naval experts know that a navy built now will not, in ten years' time, be totally uselesB from the attacks of sub marines, the laying of mines, and the changing inventions in warfare? For the United States, President Wilson's army and navy program strikes the public as wise and suffi cient as does his plea for stopping wasteful and extravagant appropria tions by congress. He truthfully de clares that the people do not object to necessary expenditure, but to ex travagance. Medical examiners of young men, applicants for service in the army and navy, find a tremendous 

IOBS of vitality and a declining physical condition In the majority of the ap plicants. It is stated that only one army recruit in six is now accepted by physicians, and on this basis: to enlist an army of 500,000 would re quire an examination of 3,000,000 men. The war department only wants the strongest and best men physically it can get. The thous -ands of the most unfit young men, in case of a war, would be left. The apparent decline in the vitality of young men is due to several causeB, excessive use of intoxicants and cig arettes being among the most prom inent. The degeneration of the he*rt, the1 arteries and the kidneys have Increased 19 per cent during r- assurer the last census period and the mor tality rate in Massachusetts, New Jersey and sixteen cities has in creased 100 per cent since 1880. In a wild race for pleasure, the aver age young man becomes an old, broken-down victim of his own heed lessness in middle life, unfit for busi ness responsibilities or a citizen's duties. Hon. Champ Clark has been wont to jibe and cast gross ridicule on the lecture performances of Secretary Bryan the star performer on Chautau qua circuits. Colonel Bryan has been .held up to the public view in a most unhappy fashion by the raucus speak er of the house, who, with his well known jocular tendencies has caused the colonel's friends many a pang. But now the shoe is on the other foot. According to the news reports the Hon. Champ Clark's latest appearance oa the Chautauqua platform at De troit promises to be his farewell ap pearance on the circuit. The reason for this is not stated in so many spe cific terms, but it is intimated that it was due to an over supply of that subtile fluid which in certain stages causes lockjaw in a speaker. It is Bryan's turn to sound the loud guf faw, yclept the horse laugh. The question that aroused the greatest interests in the late state election was that of suffrage. There were more votes on the question than were cast for either the United States senator or governor. The suffrage vote exceeded the senatorial vote by 2,247. That is, many voters expres sed themselves on that issue who did not vote for the leading candidates. The amendments had much less rec ognition. The Stutsman county vot ers cast, on the suffrage question, 2,478 votes and the senatorial vote was a little heavier in this county, being 2,501. The majority against suffrage was decisive, but sentiment changes rapidly in this state, and the next expression of opinion maye be more favorable. The legislature will have the next tussle with the ques tion on the proposed amendment passed at the last session. It will probably go to the people. Ex-Governor Divine of Minot be lieves that a new constitutional con vention should be called in North Dakota to provide means for incleas ing the amount of money raised by taxation for various state purposes, or to raise more revenue from sourc es that have heretofore escaped tax ation and which have not been pay ing their just burden of manitaining the institutions of the state. The next legislature, lie believes, will enact legislation regarding good roads, lower interest rates, increas ing immigration, better farming and holding elections every four years, which latter plan will be a great saving in money and should also limit the term of officers more strict ly than is done at present, giving the other fellow a chance. It seems that no one can raise a legitimate objection to giving aid .'the starving Belgians. It is a work of humanity and not for nation ality. It would be the'same if any other country or people were in the same plight. The appeal to Ameri ca would not be turned down. The average American is in a position to be more nearly neutral than any other citizen of any other country but at the same time he is in a posi tion to judge of the merits of a for eign controversy with strict impar tiality. The case of the Belgians, on its merits, appeals not only to Amer icans but to the civilized world as a deserving one, and it is gratifying to see the response which is being met throughout this country to the ap peal. •to There is an old saying that "youth will have its fling" and this applies, sometimes, not merely to a hilarious career or a mere exuberance of youthful spirits. In the matter of boosting North Dakota into a corn state the boys seem to be taking a leading part. They are winning prizes over the men, their elders. North Dakota is pre-eminently a state of opportunities for the young, and if it becomes one of the best corn-raising states in the Union, the boys of the present day will have the honor of making it so.

Estrayed from my place, South half Section 17, Township 141, Range 62, on December 2, 1914, One red and White spotted cow. She is blind in both eyes. Notify Peter Schmidt, Jr., Fried, N. D., if you know where she DESPERATE CONDITION OF THE BELGIANS The latest information in regard to the Belgian refugees is more and more deplorable. The American con sul at Antwerp says in a letter to Henry Van Dyke, American minister at the Hague: "It seems that Bel gium will have to face the danger of famine much earlier than any of us thought possible. If a population of six millions is to be kept alive, food must be sent and that at once." A New York journal says: "A prompt and generous action is plain ly needed. The need sends its cry to every heart. Seven of the nine provinces that compose the kingdom of Belgium have been devastated by the most dreadful war known to history. Thousands and thousands of people have nothing in the world left, not a roof over their heads, no money, no clothes, and no chance of earning a living of any sort. The sight of the poor refugees streaming into Ant werp, women with babies in their arms, their older children clinging to their skirts, men wheeling their decrepit fathers in wheelbarrows or helping along a crippled brother or son, is more pitiable than any words can express." I cannot think that Jamestown has lost its generous spirit, but I am ac tually ashamed to publish the addi tion to the Belgian fund since the re port of Saturday last. The little vil lage of Woodworth has subscribed more money for this cause up to this time than Jamestown has. There are but four days left before what we give must go forward. Is Jamestown going to take a position with the smallest villages in the state in this great work? Up to this time it looks that way. The outlook at the pres ent time is, that we shall send the money to buy a few sacks of flour instead of sending a carload from our local mill, as Stutsman county cer tainly should do. I cannot under stand how it is that we are not show ing our usual interest and generoisty. We need the spirit of Mr. Purcell's two little boys, one of whom took $2 and the other $1 from their little savings banks to give to this fund. They could not bear to feel that Bel gian children were starving a:nd they make no move or sacrifice to help prevent it. Let us arouse ourselves and do what we oughflto do and not suffer the discredit of being on a par with our smallest villages. No personal appeal will be made, as this has been objected to. H. M. TABER, Chairman Belgian Relief. BOUGHT A BALE OF COTTON. The Citizens' National Bank of Jamestown has received a bale of cot ton from Guthrie, Olcla., purchased by President Nierling that all in this vicinity may see what a real bale of cotton looks like, as it is probable that 90 per cent of the residents of this part of the country have never seen an actual bale of cotton. It is standard bale, weighing 500 pounds its dimensions are about 4% 3 by 4 feet. It is partially cov ered with a coarse rope mesh and bound with iron bands. The cotton industry, because of the sudden stop page of exportation on account of the war, has been the objeet of consider able attention recently and through out the land was spread the slogan, "Buy a Bale of Cotton." It is estimated that the United States furnishes approximately seven tenths of all the cotton fibre in the world, although the use of cotton was noted in India three thousand years ago, and in Egypt two thousand years ago. The cotton plant common ly grown in this country is a shrub like annual from two to four feet in height. It's flowers are white or pale yellow or cream color the first day they bloom, dark and red the sec ond day and fall to the ground on the third or fourth day, having a tiny ball of fruit which develops the size of a hen's egg, maturing from August to frost time. About seven months are needed, to mature-cotton. Cotton picking commences usually in September and done by hand, mostly by negroeB, who carry sacks hung around the neck. The cotton is taken to a cotton gin, where the lint or wool is separated from the Beed and compressed under high pressure Into bales of approximately 500 pounds each. 

BELGIAN FUND GROWS. Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 8.—Yester day's receipts for the Belgian relief fund ran well over $150. The larg est single individual contribution that has been received at Governor Hanna's office came in yesterday from Dr. E. P. Quain of Bismarck, he sending in a check for $50. There seems to be a movement on foot in many of the counties to send their help in the way of a carload of flour direct to Belgium from the county in terested, instead of contributing to the cash'fund that Is being raised. THE WEEKLY ALERT A DOUBLY MARRIED MAN. Sheriff Wright returned Saturday with Ray Willey, who was arrested at Sioux City, Iowa, on the charge of abandoning his wife and children, who live or formerly lived in Stuts man county. Willey made no effort to resist t'he officer and came with out a requisition. While In Sioux City the second wife visited him In the jail. He tells a story indicating a bad mixup of family affairs and re lationships. He does not seem to have much regard for wife No. 1 nor for No. 2 and makes some.damaging statements against both. He claims that he was only 15 years of age when first married and his wife was but 18. His first wife resided near Millarton. The Sioux City Journal claims that Willey lived in that city under the name of Calvin Brown and alleges that he was married more than a year ago by the county judge to Miss Nora Eshelman at Dakota City. The cou ples afterwards lived at hotels in Sioux City and Willey engaged in draying but has since sold his team and drays and Baid he was willing to come back and "take his medicine." Two of the six children are said to be at his father's in Iowa. Willey may be tried either on the charge of desertion or bigamy, and the penalty for deserting a wife and abandoning children under six years of age is from one to seven years and for big amy from one to five years. INTERESTING COURT CASE. The time of the district court for the last two days has been taken in the trial of the first jury case, that of Buchanan Elevator Company v. Jennie and James Lees of Buchanan. N. D. This is a suit in which the plaintiff seeks to recover on a promis sory note for $1,900, the note being signed by James Lees, her attorney in fact. Payment on the note was refused on the ground that the note was signed without the knowledge of Mrs. Lees, and also that the money was used in buying grain op tions, which, it is claimed, is gam bling, and debts contracted for such purposes are illegal and uncollect able under the law of the state. J. A. Buchanan of the Buchanan Ele vator company, it is claimed, acted as the agent in the purchase of op tions through the John Miller Grain company of Minneapolis. The op tion transactions covered a period from 1910 to 1913. Mr. Lees losses were heavy, some $3,800, and notes form time to time were given after his margins had been exhausted, and after his cash and securities had also failed. The case was given to the jury late Wednesday afternoon. CHRISTMAS MAIL Suggestions of Postmaster Morris in Regard to Christmas Packages. The following suggestions are of fered as applicable to senders of Christmas parcels: The distribution of Christmas gifts through the United States mall has been greatly facilitated through, the parcel post. It is expected that the amount of mail of this class will exceed all pre vious records, largely due to the in creased weight allowed and the re duction of rates, and other exten sions of the service. The co-operation of the public is urged as essential to the prompt and. satisfactory handling of the Christ mas mail. Firs. Mail your parcels early. Second. In the preparation of par cels, use good quality of wrapping paper use good, strong twine place the name of sender as well as name of addressee on the parcel use pen and ink instead of pencil do not seal parcel or place writing inside unless you wish to pay first-class rate if parcels contain fragile or perishable articles, they sliould be marked prepay the right amount postage on all parcels take them the post office- and' have the clerk rate them for you insure valuable parcels. Parcels valued at Mt more than $25 can be insured by the prepay ment of 5 cents. Pareels in value from $25 to $50 can be insured by the prepayment of 10 cents. Do not seal the flaps of your par cels with Christmas stamps. The postal regulations permit persons sending early packages to place the words "Do not open until Christ mas" on the wrapper. Commencing Saturday, December the Jamestown post office will have an extra clerk and an extra window open for the serving of our patrons. 19, The delivery of Christmas mail will be expedited at Jamestown by the employment of a team and an additional carrier, an allowance having been granted this office by the department for this purpose. Christmas stamps, if used, should _j placed on back Of parcels, that er rors may be avoided in rapid hand ling of mail. HOLSTEIN BREEDERS ASS'N —i Meets December 21-23 at rrew Salem —Notes From Bismarck. Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 3.—(Spe cial).—On December 21, 22 and 23 there will be a school for members of the North Dakota Holstein Breeders' Association circuit held at New Sa lem. A proper place will be provided to keep the stock and special stress will be laid upon feeding, care, and type sof dairy cattle. Tmong those who will take part in the meeting are Dairy Commissioner R. F. Flint, Mr. Rabild of the United States Dairy division, Superintendent Dow ney of the Breeding association, J. H. Sheppard of the Agricultural col lege and Messrs. Hoke and Peters of the dairy department of the Agricul tural college. Commission to Carrington. The members of the state railroad commission will leave Monday even ing for Carrington, where a regular meeting of the commission will be held. It is expected at this meeting that the matters which were had un der discussion at Minot and Devils Lake, the first of this week, will be finally adjusted. Looking Over Coal Land. The state engineer, Jay W. Bliss, will have under his direction in the very near future the matter of look ing over all school land that is to be offered at the next sale, in March, with the idea of ascertaining the coal deposits which may be underlying it. The sale does not include the coal rights which remain with the state. There are a number of western coun ties in which there are valuable coal deposits and all the land remaining to be sold is located in the western part of the state. Auto Tags Cost More. If the interpretation of the law with regard to affixing revenue stamps to all papers to which is af fixed a notoiral seal is as seen here, there will be an increase of ten cents in the cost of each automobile license tag, as it is necessary to have the application for a license signed be fore a notary. Unless the notary is a friend of yours who will take the acknowledgement for thanks, then the tag will cost the man who puts it on the car $3.35, $3 for the tag, 25 cents for the notary and 10 cetns for the stamp. Want Naa-Partisan Law. Legislative Reference Librarian Acker has received a number of let ters from various members of the legislature asking for information on the Minnesota non-partisan law. There seems to be an impression that the law of this state should be changed so that state, legislative and county offices should come under the nno-partisan act, the same as we now have the district and supreme bench judges and the school officers. There was an effort made to pass a law of this kind at a previous ses sion, but it failed of sufficient sup port. Board of Instruction Formed Lieutenant-Colonel Tharalson, Ma jor Frank S. Henry, Major T. C. Pat terson ani Captain James M. Hanley of the North Dakota National Guard, •with Lievtenant F. H. Turner of the United' States regular army, bare ibeen appointed a board of instruc tion for the national guard officers of the state. Lieutenant Turner is an ex-offlcio member with the title of Inspector-Instructor. The board Is appointed to serve until Septem ber 30, 1915, unless sooner relieved by proper authority. Four schoolB of instruction have been named, as follows: An armory school of instruc tion for officers at the station of each company an armory school for non commissioned officers at the station of each company a correspondence school for all medical officers, and an armory school for non-commis sioned officers of the medical corps at Lisbon. It is the intention of hte board to make the examinations more rigid in the future and it is ex pected that those officers who do not pass satisfactory examinations will be dealt with in a. manner that wilL be a lesson to others who may be put in their places if it is found necessary to drop any of them. MANY BIDDERS AT DELINQUENT TAX SALE The sale of delinquent real estate taxes for the year 1913 was held Tuesday at the court house by County Auditor Blewett. A good attendance __ bidders was present and the vari ous pieces of property were offered and sold, mostly at 12 per cent int^r t. Theie was considerable com petition, however, and several pieces were sold at 7 and 8 per cent. Bid ders were present from Wimbledon, Courtenay, Kensal, Medina and oth parts of the county. The list was somewhat larger than that of last year. The county will receive a large sum of money from the pro ceeds of the sale. A good many own ers had paid taxes since the datt of publication.,^. yj.' f*/ "*vk- v' v'- .k'-. tM'-T- 

BELGIAN RELIEF MUNDS INCREASING Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 7.—-(Spe cial).—Governor Hanna received a remittance from Grand Forks for the eBlgian relief fund amounting to $969.35 from Dr. J. B. Taylor, whom the governor had appointed chairman of the committee in Grand Forks. This is the largest single subscrip tion that has been received as yet and goes to show that the people of the state ore going to do their share in extending aid to the suffering. Bot tineau county alone has sent three carloads of flour to Belgium. In speaking of the fact that people of Minnesota ahve subscribed $75,000 to this fund, the governor said: "I believe that in proportion to our pop ulation the state of North Dakota- will send more to Belgium tahn will Min nesota. I am more than pleased with the response that is being made to the appeal in our state." MARRIED AT JAMESTOWN. At the Scandinavian Lutheran church, Monday, occurred the wed ding of Miss Emily Peterson of this city to Charles O. Steen of Pingree, Rev. J. C. Wisnaes performing the ceremony. The witnesses were Mies Olga Hulth of Jamestown and O. A. Ruud of Pingree. Mr. and Mrs. Steen will reside at Pingree where the groom conducts a harness and sad dlery establishment. JAMESTOWN WOMEN URGED TO ACT In National Movement to Send Peace Envoy to Warring Countries. The cause of women as advocates of peace ha sbeen eloquently repre sented in the twin cities recently by a woman from Austria-Hungary. Frau Schwimmer is the name of the woman peace advocate, who is plead ing for this country to send an envoy of peace to Europe to demand, in the name of humanity, that, this terrible war be stopped. Frau Schwimmer in terviewed the president in September last on this question, and it is un derstood that if the people of this country were behind such a project that he would act in accordance with those desires. Frau Schwimmer rep resents a large portion of Europe whose people are opposed to this war, the women who care naught for the glory of militarism or the triumphs of victorious generals, while sons, brothers, and husbands are being slaughtered like so many dumb ani mals to carry out these vain-glorious ambitions. Frau Schwimmer de clares that once the people of Europe, as a whole, were arrogant towards this country, considering it a country without traditions but now the Unit ed States is regarded as the great moral force of the world that it 1b galling to the pride of the various countries engaged in war to propose peace at this time, but if it were urg ed on them from outside, they would gladly listen. The effect in Europe of the war upon men is described as something terrible. All men from 18 to 48 are being taken from every occupation and men of the finest character and most cultivated instincts have been forced to become murderers of their fellow men to carry out the wishes of the war lords. The women of this country are urged by Frau Schwimmer to unite in an effort to stop the war and to put an end to the horrors that threat en to blot out the progress of civiliza tion of the last 500 years and wom an's clubs throughout the country are urged to take some action against this onslaught of militarism by pro posing a peace envoy for Europe. Mrs. A. M. Burt, a member of a St. Paul woman's club, writes to friends in Jamestown, suggesting that the women's organizations here call a joint meeting and send tele grams to the president urging that he dispatch envoys of peace to Europe. A meeting will be held in Washington, D. C., called by Jane Adams of Chica go, for the purpose of endorsing Frau Schwimmer's mission to the United States. This project is wholly international and the welfare of all the women on both sides is being con sidered wholly in the interests of hu manity. At the Woman's Welfare league of St. Paul, Mme. Schwimmer declared that the Red Cross work of various kinds given by the United States wilt only result in prolonging the war and is a waste of time, money and sym pathy. She declares that neutral countries can do a great deal moer by sending envoys as peace messengers of the neutral countries and unite in a demand in the name of humanity upon the warring nations that they cease hostilities and agree to an ar mistice, which will be the first step towards peace.
