Central Ohio j Railroad, we?t of Barnesville, the other j da/, resulting in the death of Mil* Han nab Webster, aged 18 jear*, daughter of Eli Webster. Mia* Webster was sweeping the home about nine o'clock in the mor ning, wben something having attracted her attention she looked out of the window while she continued to sweep, and struck a loaded gun which stood in the corner, causing it to partly fall, wben she caught the muzzle in her hand, just when the muzzle had fallen far enough for the lock to strike tbe floor. Holding tbe muzzle of the gun in her hand when it went off, the ball entered the pit of her stomack, pas ed through one lung and lodged. She was alone when the accident occurred and laid on tbe floor from this time in the morning ustil about 4 o'clock in the evening when her brothers came home from school. She was still sensible, could talk, and related to them all the particulars in regard to tbe fatal accident. She laj weltering in her own blood from morn till night, ere anj one came to whisper soft words of conso lation, or render her anj assistance. She lived until dajlight tbe next morning, during a portion of whi;h time she was able to converse with her friends. Cochtt Court.?The County Court has been engaged, principally, during the last two dajs, in the transaction of civil business. A couple of criminal cases, however, were disposed of. Chas. Butler, a gentleman of color, waa found gailty of stealing a bottle of whisky, and sentenced to one month's imprisonment in the countj jail. The case of John Young, charged with stealing a lot of books, two overcoats and a pistol from the McLnre Honse, while in the employ of that establishment, was dispo sed of yesterday. Mr. A. Williamson, a clerk in the McLure House, testified as to the main facta in the case. The father of the accused, apparently a very honest and respectable German, who keeps a public house in the borough of Birmingham, Pa., was present. He testified that his son had left home some time ago for the purpose of "seeing the elephant." The old gentleman heard from the boy several times, and be ing in hopes that when he had taken a good look at the elephant, he would return home, bad not bothered himself much about him. The old gentleman seemed to regiet very much that the elephant had got the better of the boy. The accused was admitted to bail in the sum of $500. JJfcgr Skating.?The amusement of skating, says, an exchange, unless indulg ed in to an excess, is a Healthy one and those who practice regularly on the ice soon lose that disposition to shrink from every cold breath of air, which is fostered by the confining labors of the close work shop and the counting room. In the East skating has become the "rage"''"for both sexes, and will no doubt be enthusiastically followed this winter by thousands of fair belles, who would ordioarily consider a winter day's walk to Stewart's or some other fashionable emporium, too iatigu iog to be thought of. The fashion has al ready been immortalized in verse, and some susceptible city poet goes off thus : "A modern Adonis went up to the poud, To witness the feats of a sweet little blonde, With two tinny Bkates that like marriage bells ring, Catting hieroglyphics and hearts in device. She was poised like a bird on the wing, For indeed she was the most beautiful thing On ice." Thh Obstruction or Sidbwaucs.? Too mach license is allowed to people who habitually obstruct the sidewalks upon the leading thoroughfare!. On those streets where pedestrians hare no occasion to prom cnade, not a word should be said about the obstructions,which after all are but the bar ometers of business and the tokens of thrift. But upon other streets not whollj given up to trade, the ordinance prohibiting side walk obstructions, is total!/ ignored. Bu siness men located upon these streets which are much travelled should constant!/ hate in mind the inconvenience to which their outstanding boxes, barrels, garbage, Ac., are continnall/ subjecting the hundreds who brush, soil or tear their garments against them. If the cursings could reach the ears of the police there would be some thing to pay immediately. |&?A.

Impo*ta*t To?Ajcco*iiTgv?The following decision of thf Coifamlssioner of the Revenue, is important to a Ytry Urge <-Uis of oar citizen's V When persons are employed by tobac oonlata or dealer* io cigars, whether , in the same town or at a distance, to manu facture cigars, and for this purpose to re. celve tobacco from their employers to be made into cigars, which, when finished, are returned to their employers, sach persons may not be required to pay the value there of, provided, at the request of the assessor, they make out a list, subscribed and awprn to, which list shall state the number of ci gars so made during each month, and as near as may be, the value thereof, with the name and residence of the person to whom the cigars have been returned. If the said employer, to whom the cigars are returned, shall not reside, nor have his usual place of business, in a district io which the list is made out, then the assessor shall trans mit it to the district where such employer resides, to the end that the duties thereoo, under the excise law, may be paid by the employer. But if the parties live in theI same district, the assessor will assess the j amount due in such lists to the employer. I J^TThk Old Stats akd thb New.? The special telegraphio correspondent of the Pittsburgh Gazette has tbe following announcement: When the new State is admitted, the old government of conrse belongs only to the Eastern part of the State. The President has been promised, therefore, thafon the admission of the new State the capital of the old State shall be remored to Alexan dria, where Got Peirpoint will Sx his resi dence, and where what remains of the old State Government will continne its opera, tions. J A resolution proposing to adjourn the Legislature to Alexandria on the 1st of January next was debated in both Houses of the General Assembly yesterday. Holiday Adtbbtisimo.?The shop windows of our merchants and shop-keep ers begin to assume a holiday appearance, and many of them look quite attractive.? Of course all who deal in articles appropri ate for Christmas presents will make the fact known through the columns ot the In telUgeacer so that people will know where to make purchases to the* best advantage. Now is the time for shop-keepers to call public attention to their wares and prepare for the pecuniary harvest that is sure to fol low a liberal expenditure for holiday ad vertising. Ktllbd bv tub Cabs.?A man at tempted to cross the track of the Cleveland and Pittsburgh railroad, near the former place, on Wednesday, in front of a locomo tive. He was caught by the cow-catcher, thrown off the track and killed. The train was stopped and backed up to the spot, the man taken to a neighboring house, and ev erything possible done for him, but be died io a short time.

Late advices from Kansas give an ac count of the arrest of Col. Adams and Lieut. Col. Hayes, of the 12th Kansas vol anteers, in Western Missouri, by General Vaughn of the Missouri State Guards.? Col. Adams had made a successful expedi tion into Missouri, against the guerrillas, capturing about 100 wagons and 50 ne- | groes, and on beiag ordered by Vaughn to I surrender the negroes and property and to I leave the State, expressed his willingness to comply with all the demauda, except to surrender the negroes, which he refused.? Vaughn baring a force ot 1,000 men, with artillery, and Adams only 250 men, the lat ter had no chance but to comply, and has been sent to St. Louis for trial on the 15th inst. Adams is a son-in-law of Senator Lane, of Kansas. A special despatch from the Timu\ cor respondent with Hooker, says that the reb els continue active work on their fortifica tions, although it is regarded aa a ruae to conceal their movement toward Richmond. Flight of the Rebels into Arkansas St. Loci8, Dec. 11.?Gen. Blunt tele graphs to Gen. Curtis that the rebels whom he fought in the battle at Prairie Grove, have probably crossed the Arkansas xiTer. They left all their wounded on the field, and most of their dead uncared for. One hundred of their wounded have died since the battle and a large number of the re* tnninder are-mortally wounded. Their to tal loss is estimated by Blunt at uearly 2,000. Our loss was 200 killed and 500 wounded, roost of the latter will recover. Gen. llerron pots the enemy's long at from 500 to 700 killed nnd 2,600 wounded, and estimates o ur own loss higher than Blunt. Col. Black, of the 37th Illinois Wtts killed and Maj.

LAST SlflBfrS DISPATCfflfo XXXVIIth Congress?2nd Session. Washikgtov, Dec. 11. Messrs. Hall and Sumner presented peti tions protesting against the action of the advisory board of the navy. Messrs. Kinjj, Pomeroy and Howard pre sented petitions is favor of a general bank rupt act. Mr. Browning introduced a bill to ameq4 the act establishing the t rritorial government of Utah and to facilitate the administration of justice in said territory. Referred to Judiciary Committee. A message was received from the Presi dent recommending a vote of thanks to Lieut Geo. W. Morris for the determined valor and heroism be displayed in defense of the sloop of war Cumberland against the rebel iron clad Merrimac. Also, recom. mending a vote of thanks to Lieut. Geo. L. Worden for the skill and gallantry ex hibited by him in the battle between the Monitor and rebel steamer Merrimac. Re ferred to Naval Committee. A communication was also received from the President, answering a resolution of the Senate calling for information and evi dence relative to the Indian barbarities in Minnesota. Ordered to be printed. The resolution relative to the arbitary ar rests of certain citizens of Delaware was taken up. Mr. Morrsll contended that the resolution as it now stood, was not a mere resolution of enquiry, but a charge against the gov ernment and an indictment President Lin I coin. He should vote for no such resolu tion. He claimed that in this state of war and rebellion, with the land full of traitors and spies, the Commander-in-Chief has the right to arrest eucb men. No one, not ! even (be Senator from Delaware, Saols bury, has claimed that these men were Ior*l. There had been many arrests made and i the proper presumption is that the President has been arresting guilty men and simply doing his duty; he, Lincoln, ought to do it. It will not do to pretend that a State and all i'.s people are loyal, it is known that the State of Kentucky has been but a nest of traitors, three out of every four of the able bodied men of Kentucky have gone to rebeldom, and nobody is left there but old women; yet the Senator from Kentuky (Powell) asks for commiseration for these men. That Senator (Powell) had denounced the Government from tbe be ginuing, the same as his colleague who fol loved the logical result of his reasoning and had gone into tbe rebel army, but not a sigle word does that 8euater (Powell) offer against tbe rebels, and rejoices over tbe recent elections, and says tbe lion hearted Democracy are rebuking this Ad ministration. Well, every rebel through out rebeldom rejoices in the same way. It is supposed there will be a peace party in the North that will force this Government into an inglorious peace, and that party encouraged Jeff. Davis and foreign coun tries in their schemes of intervention. There ought to be some proof that these i men were loyal. Mr. Morrill contended there was no ground for complaint that men were arrest ted on suspicion. Men were always arrest ed on suspicion of crime. Mr. Wright moved to amend the resolu tion, so as to make the call npon the Sec retary of War. Wright said he knew no taan was permitted to lire in the South, who had anj sympathy with the North , he would like to see some of the spirit that was shown by Stonewall Jackson when he fonnd 47 of his men skedaddling from the battle, be marched them in front of the regiment and had every men of them shot. Instead of this, we have propositions for Conventions, &c. Mr. Bayard argued at some length to show that the affairs of the State of Ken tucky had nothing whatever to do with the State of Deleware, and that true loyal ty to the country did not emply loyalty to any single Individual. If this is a 'free country the people in it certainly have a right to inquire into the acts of the Presi dent. Mr. Powell said the President bad vio lated the Constitution and be was ready to prove it. He defied the Senator from Maine or any other'Senator on this floor to the lists on the question. He denied that 3 out of 4 of the people of the State of Kentucky were in the rebel army. Three-fonrths of the peoplv of that State were not in arms at all and he be lieved that there were more in the Union than in the rebel army. lie, Powell, wan ted to indulge in no personalities with any Senator here, as there was a way to settle personal matters elsewhere. He wanted Senators to meet bis "rgnments fairly. He did not believe this Union could ever be restored by force of arms, therefore, he had opposed the war and should continue to oppose it. He was in favor of the con vention |proposed by his colleague, Davis. He should also vote for an armistice while that Convention should continue to be in session. He contended that Presi dent Lincoln had violated the Constitution, in enlarging the regular army, in suspen ding the writ of habeas corpus, in arresting citizens, in interfering with the freedom of the press and in bis recent proclamation. Mr. Fessenden was willlog to admit that some things bad been done, apparently without law. The ery that the country was in danger always came from papers sympatizing with the rebellion. Many things may be and must be dooe in times like these, which ordioarily could not be allowed. Does on body doubt the patriot ism of the President of the United States?
