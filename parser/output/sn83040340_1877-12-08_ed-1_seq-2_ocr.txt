Oliver Browx, a son of Old John Brown, and supposed to be the only stir yivor of those who participated with the old man in his -raid on Harper's Ferry, is living on Jay Cooke's island, Gibral tar, in Lake Erie. The State Board of Canvassers has completed the canvass. of the returns of the late election, .and issued a certificate to Mr.-Humphrcys, and he was sworn Into office. The Attorney General will now obtain a writ of quo warranto against Mr.H., and hit right to the office will be tested by judicial proceedings at once. A horrible murder was committed in Pottawattomie County, a few days ago. Rev. Mr. Wblpert, a Methodist minister stationed at , in Clay .County, left his homo about the 1st of November to go to his farm near Topeka for a load of apples. After that time, nothing was heard from him by his friends until a few days since, when it was learned that his team had been sold to a man near Wamego. The person vwbo sold the team a young man named J. D. True was arrested and taken to Louisville, the county seat of Potta wattamie County. A mob took the prisoner, and by threats compelled him to tell where the body of Mr. Wolpert was concealed, after which he was re turned to the officers. A party started out, and found the body of the mur dered man, just where True had stated it to be. It had been left in a ravine, .without covering, and was horribly mu tilated by birds and beasts. The pris oner is confined in the jail at Louisville, and denies that he killed Mr. W., but alleges that one Clark Allen is the .murderer, and employed him (True) to .sell the team on shares. True also says that Allen told him where the body was .concealed. There is great excitement about Louisville and vicinity, and it is eared that the prisoner will be taken .out of jail and lynched. THE FttESlDEM'S MESSAGE- We publish on our outside this week the first annual message of President Hayes, delivered before Congress on Monday last. It is an able and carefully prepared document, and while we do not endorse all of it, it still contains many valuable suggestions which' Con gress will do well to heed. In regard to his Southern policy, we cannot aree with the President in his views concerning its results. It is prob ably true that under it reace and quiet have prevailed at the South to a greater extent that heretofore, but this state of affaire has been the result of the com plete intimidation of Republicans white as well as black through his non interferencepolicy. The same thing might have happened under Gen. Grant's ad ministration, bad he seen fit to with draw federal protection from the ballot box,and there would have been noRepub lican party in the South at the last Presi dential election Samuel J.Tilden would have been in the whitehouse to-day, and Rutherford B. Hayes would have been simply Governor of Ohio. In this opin ion, however, we may be mistaken, and we sincerely hope that we are. It Is pos sible that all classes of citizens in the South are fully protected in -the free ex ercise of all their civil and political rights, but all the evidence we have seen and heard upon the subject so far, con firms us jn the opposite belief. On the silver question the President takes moderate ground. He admits that an additional amount of coin is needed, but thinks that in. making silver an un limited legal tender, an exception should be made in favor of onr national debt. So far as bonds issued since 1873 are concerned this view is probably correct, as since that time gold has been the only coin in this country recognized as mon ey; but in regard to bonds issued prior to that date, we think the case is entirely different, for up to that time the silver dollar had been' the unit of our money, and a legal tender for any amount. We hope, however, that the friends of the silver bill will so modify it as to meet the President's yiews. When a man is hungry "half a loaf is better than no bread," and such a bill as Mr. Hayes suggests is decidedly better than none. Regarding the repeal of the resump tion act, the President expresses himself with great positiveness, as being opposed to any change in the present law. If the silver bill passes, so that both silver and gold can be used, it is possible that resumption may take place at the time contemplafed, without very greatly de ranging the commercial interests of the country, but if it takes place in gold alone, wo look for a general prostration of business, only equaled by the panic of 1873. The President recommends the levy ing of an import duty on tea and coffee. We differ with him again there. Tea and coffee are articles of general con sumption among the poorer classes and nnless the necessity for additional reve nue becomes more pressing than it now seems to be, no tax should collected from them. - The other suggestions contained in the meajage we generally approve." On the whole, the message, though. a very able one, will be decidedly unpopular in "the 'West, for the present, at least. THE 

"DOLLAR 6P 8UR DABD1ES." The Bint of the United States waa es tablished by s act of Congress passed April 2. 1792 for the purpose of provid ing "a national coinage." The act de clares that the "money of account shall be expressed in "dollars or units, dimes or tenths, cents or hundredths, and mills or thousandths." The dollar was taken as the unit or standard, from the fact that prior to the establishment of our independence, the old, (silver) Spanish dollar was largely in use in the colonies and for many years, had practically been the unit of value in most commercial transactions. Prior to the passage of this act, the question as to whether the money of the country should consist of a double or single coinage was discussed by Alexan der Hamilton and other eminent finan ciers, and it was decided that both the precious metals should be used, as either alone was thought to be insufficient. The act also placed the relative value of the metals at 15 to 1. The weight of the silver coins was fixed at 371.25 grains of pure silver per dollar, and gold coins at 24.5 grains of pure gold to the dollar. No gold dollar pieces were coined under this act. Silver alone was used for the coinage of the dollar, and the fractions thereof, except cents and half cents, which were made of copper. At the time the relative values of the two metals were fixed for coinage, silver judged by the bullion markets of the world, was slightly overrated as com pared with gold. In 1803 th'e French government placed the relative value of the metals at 15 to 1, and this proper; tion was also adopted by the Latin Un ion in 1865. No change in the weight or fineness of our coin occurred until 1834, when gold coins were reduced in weight to 23.20 grains.- This change made the relative value of the metals 16 to 1, which over rated gold a little. The silver dollar the unit of value was not changed. Silver had notalien, but gold had risen sligh ly. During this period of forty-two years, although silver was a little overrated, there was no unhealthy influx of this metal, nor was there any perceptible drain of gold. The two metals circu lated side by side, and practically, were of equal value. In 1837, a slight change was again made in gold coins. Their fineness was increased from .899,225 to .900, making the coins contain 23-22 grains of pure gold per dollar, instead of 23.20. The fineness of standard silver was also made .900, and the weight of silver coin (in cluding alloy) was 412 grains. The amount of pure silver, however, remain ed the same 371.25 grains to tbe dollar. The most radical change in our silver coinage occurred in 1853. As before stated, the change in the relative values of the metals made in 1834, slightly un pervalued silver, and this in connection with the vast influx of gold following the unprecedently rich discoveries of thisjnetal in California and Australia, produced a scarcity of silver coin. The government, therefore, reduced the weight of the subsidiary silver coins to 384 grains of standard silver per dollar; restricted their legal tender use to the payment of sums of $5 or less, and dis continued the practice of coining silver for individuals. Up to this time all sil ver coins had been a legal tender to any amount. No change was made in the weight or fineness of the silver dollar piece, -and its legal tender property was not restricted by this act, but its com mercial value was about 4 per cent. more than its nominal worth, and some 7 per cent above that of the new subsid iary coin. Of course,, the government found it more profitable to coin the a nailer pieces, and the coining of the oid-fashioned dollar was abandoned. The weight of pure silver in the old-fashioned "dollar of our daddies," was never changed. It is perhaps, the only piece of coin, (expept, possibly, the copper cent) ever issued from our mint that has not been changed. In 1873, however, its coinage was discontinued by act of Congress, and the gold dollar substituted in its place as the unit of value. At wis time me iractionai silver coins-l were increased in weight from 384 to 385.8 grains of standard silver to the dollar, to make them correspond with the Latin five franc piece. Their legal tender value was also restricted to the payment of sums of five dollars, or less. There is nothing, however, in the act of 1873 destroying the legal tender prop crties of the old silver dollar, but in 1874, a revision of the United States statutes was made, and the wording of the original act was so changed by tbe revisers as to limit the legal tender power of the dollar to the same extent that the subsidiary coins had been restricted in 1873: The committee making the revis ion were instructed to make no changes in the laws then in force. Its duty was simply to condense and simplify the stat utes by throwing out laws which from time to time had been repealed. Instead, however, of confining its attention to the specific object for which it wasappointed the committe made a radical change 'in the law of 1873, and Congress adopted the revision supposing it to be just what ii snouia nave ocen, simply a compen dium of laws already in force.

In making its seventh annual an nouncement, The Liter Ocean reassures its readers aud the public generally of its laitb tonne Republican party and its devotion to Republican principles. Its record the past year has made it more than ever before the great representative Republican paper of the country. The value of such a paper and its influence for good were never more apparent than during the electoral complications of last fall and winter, llie course of The later Ocean during that trying period, won for it the admiration ana lasting friendship of Republican eveiywbere. As an exponent of true Republicanism, to which the public turned for advice and encouragement, The Inter Ocean stood throughout the momentous struggle wituout a peer. There never was a time when Rcpub licans more needed a journal steadfast and true than now. Never before.in tbe history of the country, has there been a period of such political interest and in quiry as is now in tbe immediate future. Great questions are to be discussed and disposed of ; embarrassing complications are to be grappled witn ; fundamental principles are to be defended. Republi can to the core, The Inter Ocean will give all possible informatiou on all political topics, and while treatingopponents with the greatest fairness, will maintain its high standing as an earnest and outspo ken advocate of uncompromising and unadulterated .Republicanism. While The Inter Ocean stands second to 'no paper in country as a political journal, it takes high rank as an enter prising and thorough going newspaper. During the past year it has eclipsed all Western papers in the excellence, com pleteness, and reliability of its foreign dispatches and letters, and has had few equals in presenting in most readable shape general and home news. In every part of the world great events are occur ring, with probabilities pointing to more important in the future. Never before was a good newspaper so important to young and old. In all that goes to make a firftclats newspaper, The Inter Ocean 13 not e.v crllcd by any publication in thocouutry. It is a national newspaper, one that will bo found useful and interesting to Amer icans in every part of the globe. While it especially represents the great inter est.s of the Northwest, it is national in its views and comprehensive in its news gathering. The Inter Ocean makes especial claim as a family newspaper, devoting more at tention than any other political newspa per to departments prepared and con ducted with the wants of the home and the demands of the family in view. The Commercial Department is con ducted with preat care, and everything possible is done to make the market re ports reliable and complete. The Agricultural Department is care fully edited by a gentleman, of ability and experience. The Home Department m of special interest to the ladies, and is devoted to the practical and useful. To Educational Matters especial atten tion is pivon. Believing that the perpe tuity of fie republic depends upon the eilucatr n ol the people, J he Inter Ucean is the warm advocate of the free a:hol system, aid evert t'ring that will im prove and extend it. The. Woman's Kingdom is a new de partment devoted to the interests of that larce portion of the gentler sex who, either from necessity or otherwise, debiro to devote themselves to some useful oc cupation or profession, tor tlie purpose of earning a livelihood. It is -not for the advocacy of any particular issue, but for the general improvement and eleva tion of the female character in ever' dc partment of life. The Question and Answer Depart ment, long a special feature of The Inter Ocean, ts a valuable encyclopedia of in formation, and covers as much ground in the course of a year as many of the elaborate works published at such high prices. The Inter Ocean has the largest aggre gate circulation of any newspaper pub lished in the Northwest. It is sent to more than 8,500 post-offices, distributed in every State and Territory in the Uni ted States, in all the British provinces, and numerous foreign states and coun tries.
