GREAT BRITAIN and Ireland have turned out 54,623,700 gallons of whisky in 1897, over 5,000,000 gallons more than in the previous year. Of this 32, 120,238 gallons were consumed in tho United Kingdom and 4,710,1S1 gallons exported. There arc 193 distilleries sib work in Scotland, 29 in Ireland, nino in England and one in Wales. MRS. FANNIE M. McKoos owns and manages one of the largest ranches in California. It covers 10,000 acres, about 15 miles from San Diego. Since her husband's death three years ago, Mrs. McKoon, although entirely with out experience at that time,has operat ed it so well that it is now one of the most successful ranches in the country. WALTER DARLINGTON, mayor of Con cordia, Kan., is the largest cattle feed er in north central Kansas this fall ritad winter. lie has 1,700 head in the vicinity of Big Bend, Phillips county, 500 head near Harlan, Smith county, and 400 head in the vicinity of Concor diny Cloudy county.

Ulinby, of Brooklyn, has produced an electric tor pedo fcr use in ba'ttles on land. The torpe ini:? are long, cigar-shaped pro jectiles, mounted on rolling trucks. The machinery to propel them is operated by electricity, furnished by means of a wire connecting with tho central station. SNOW statues are the latest form of »r.(.istic freak and their creator is M. Tierre Roche, a French sculptor of gt: pute. The statue is made of copper, aud in the base, is a reservoir of li«iue licd carbonic acid used to generate the cold, and tho moisture which is ab stracted from the atmosphere forms on the surface of the metal as a coating of snow in the course of a few mo ments, and is prevented from thawing by the freezing mixture. AN old-time swindle seems to have been revived in a letter from a pretend ed officcr in the Spanish army, now in a supposititious prison in Spain, who claims to have buried a large sum of money near Brazil, Ind. lie will give one-third of the entire amount to any person who will remit to him by mail the trivial sum necessary to pay his beloved daughter's passage from Spain to the United states aud the necessary expenses of unearthing the treasure. Who speaks first. ON the approach of a thunder storm French peasants often make up a very smoky tire in the belief that safety from lightning is thus assured. By some this is deemed a superstition, but Schuster shows that ttie custom is based on reason, inasmuch as the smoke acts as a good conductor for carrying away the electricity slowly and safely, lie points out that in 1,()00 cases of damage by lightning 0.3 churches and S.5 mills have been struck, whilst the number of factory chimneys lias only been 0.3. NEW YOIIK papers mention a rare case of personal integrity and business houor which has come to light in that city. In 1S61 Mr. Amos F. lino was a member of a firm which failed shortly after the war began. The stock was sold, the debts paid pro rata and re leases were signed by the creditors. Now, after US years, Mr. Eno is paying off the balance of all claims, with four per cent, interest since 18G1, amount ing in the aggregate to about.®.",00,000. Such cases as this tend to strengthen commercial integrity everywhere. The French have a decidedly prac tical way of looking at new methods of locomotion. No sooner was the bi cycle established than a large revenue producing tax was imposed on it, and now it has been decided by the French authorities to impose a tax on motor cars, the tax apparently varying in different parts,according to the density of the population. In the large cen ters of population the tax wilL be a somewhat serious item, and in Paris it amounts to §12 on vehicles for two pas sengers, and.520 on larger vehicles. THE signal corps of the United States army now operates about 802 miles of military telegraphs. The most notable advancc of the year in its system has been the adoption of a combination tel egraph and telephone apparatus which only weighs 10 pounds, aud consequent ly can easily be carried by one soldier. AVitli this apparatus one soldier can telegraph a message to another, while a telephonic conversation with another station can be simultaneously carried on, the distant operators only receiv ing the messages intended for each. OUR national post otliee shows a de ficit of between $15,000,000 and S10, 000,000 this year, while the English government has a surplus of about §!!(!,• 000,000 annually. 'The cause of deficit does not rest with letter postage. That has always paid its way and substan tially supported the whole service. The discrepancy between receipts and ex penditures arises from another source. The loss to the government by second class mail matter is scarcely less than §40,000,000 a year, the established rate for this class being only one-fifteenth .of the actual cost of transmission and -"handling. THIS power of the mayor of Greater hr. New York is greater than that of some VJf'kings.

Within the mayor's irect appointment are 245 heads of de partments, and these control a verit able army of employes, whose salaries aount to 833,000,000 per annum, exauder, king of Servia, is dwarfed this comparison.

HOPE FOR RECOVERY IS HELD OUT. PliyslulBUN Sny tlie I?ul Mny Come nt Any Moment—'The President l.cnvcM for Canton Immediately Upon Ite cciiit of the .Vein Biographical Sketch oC the Aycil Woman. Canton, 0., Dec. 3.—At an early hour Thursday morning Mrs. Nancy Allison JleKiuley, the venerable mother of the presideut, was stricken with paralysis, and her death is believed to be only a question of a short time. Not since Mrs. McKiuley was stricken has there been a favorable feature in her condi tion. That the attack would ultimate ly end in death was the first fear of the family on discovering her illness, and the consultations of tbe attending phy sicians have tended to confirm this be lief. Every effort is being made to ren der the patient comfortable, and what will doubtless prove to be her last ill ness as free from suffering as possible. The paralysis, when it first appeared, was not of a serious form, and seemed only to have affected her vocal chords. MRS. 

NANCY ALLISON M'KINLEY. She was able to walk from her own bed chamber to that of her daughter, Miss Helen McKinley, to give the first, intimation of the attack, and at that time seemed to be in possession of all mental and physical faculties, but soon afterward a change was noticed, and in the afternoon she eank into a con dition of semi-consciousness, in which she has since remained. The President Notified. Mr. Abuer McKinley communicated with the xresident as soon as he learned the serious nature of the illness of his mother, and the president asked that he be advised immediately of every change. Appointments were made for communication by telephone, and tele grams were also exchanged frequently. Soon after noon Mr. Abner McKinle.v notified the president that the sufferer had lapsed into semiconsciousness and promised to communicate further at five o'clock in the afternoon. The president did not wait for the five o'clock message. He responded: "Tell mother I will be there," and at once prepared to start for Canton. He ie expected to arrive here at ten o'clock this morning. I'reHldcnt Leaven Wanhington. Washington, Dec. 3.—President Mc Kinley left the city at 7:20 o'clock Thursday night over the Pennsylvania railroad to hasten to the bedside of his sick mother at Canton, where he will arrive to-day. With him went Judge Day, assistant secretary of state, the two occupying the Pullman car Davy Crockett attached to the regular train. BioKrnphical Sketch. [Mrs. McKinley comes of the race of hardy pioneers who la'ld the founcJaiton ol the American republic. She was i^iss Nan cy Campbell Allison, and was born af New Lisbon. O., in 1809. Her family originally came from England to Virginia, thence to Pennsylvania and finally settled perma nently In Ohio. She was married to William McKinley, Sr., January i, 1S29, and was liv ing in a two-story frame house, still stand ing near Nlles, O., when her distinguished son was born, January 29, 1843. The re moval from Niles to Mahoning county was prompted by a desire to give her children an academic education. Mrs. McKinley was a woman of sterling qualities, frugal, Industrious, pious and proud her son. Her patriotism was strong and passion ate and her Intellectual power was truly wonderful. Her husband died November 24, 1892. Like the mothers of Garfield and Grant, she lived and rejoiced to see her son president of his and her country. When President McKinley entered congress over 20 years ago he was away l'rom his mother much of the time until he retired from con gress to make the canvass for governor in 1891. During his service from 1892 to 1896 as governor he went to Canton fre quently to visit his mother, and he was with her from January, 1896, until he went to Washington last March. Previous to en tering public life the president was al ways located near his parents and tent much time with them.] Killed Eni'h Other.
