The report of the postmaster general to congress made public today and which, so far as it relates to rural 'free delivery, is published elsewhere .in this issue with but slight abridge ment, brings out some very important (acts upon this subject. The expert mental rural free "delivery service inaugurated up to this time "has dem onstrated some remarkable results. The conclusion reached by the post master general that rural free deliv ery can be' extended to every portion of the country adapted to the same at -a net increase in expenditures of $12, 000,000 per year will be of great sur .prise and is a matter of.much con gratulation. It means that rural free delivery will not only be retained 'where it has heretofore been experi mentally tried, but that it will also ,• soon be extended to every home in the land where the population is sufficiently dense to warrant the ser- Tice. Another fact pointed out by the postmaster general, is of much sig niflcance.. It is, that if certain abuses which have grown up with reference •to second-cass mail matter -be abol ished, this reform alone will effect a sufficient saving in expenditures and Increase in revenues to cover the total net additional cost. to ^xtend rural free delivery thruout the entire Unit ed States. That this matter has been worked out to -such a successful con clusion reflects great credit upon Postmaster General Smith and ex First Assistant Postmaster General I Perry S. Heath, who was an ardent advocate of rural free delivery and who claimed from the first that it was a practical measure and would prove ^entirely feasible without imposing an undue burden of taxation in order to bring it about. The republican party in its national platform and President McKinley in his message to congress have indorsed und commend •. ed this great advance in the postal service Of the nation. The report of Postmaster General Smith upon this subject will be read with the greatest interest by residents of the rural dis tricts in this part of the state. In connection with the above it is Interesting to note that-Major John B. Jeffrey, special agent of the postoffice /. department, has completed' the in spection of five proposed new rural free delivery routes in Wapello coun ty, and will recommend the estab lishment of the same at once. Two of these routes extend from Ottumwa, two from Agency, one from Eldon and one from Hedrick. The latter occu pies the extreme northeastern corner of the county. There are already in operation in this county three routes —one from Ottumwa, one from Ba tavia and one from Hedrick. Peti tions are now in circulation, asking for the establishment of a new route starting from Blakesburg, and occupy ing the extreme southwestern corner of the county. Also a petition asking for a route starting from Ottumwa and running out thru the Bear Creek dis trict in the direction of Munterville. Four routes were recently established in Davis county, and several in each of Keokuk, Mahaska and Monroe coun ties. SSps. Sir A 

GOOD R0AD3 PROPOSITION. Free rural delivery of mail is a good roads proposition of the most far reaching importance. The honorable postmaster general in his annual re port to congress says: "Good roads become indespensable and their improvement is the essen tial condition of the service." After the people in the rural dis tricts ftave once enjoyed tne great ad vantage of rural free delivery of mail they will not give up tlie service. The postoffice department must, from the very nature of the case, insist that the roads traversed by rural delivery routes be put in first class condition, and he so kept at all seasons of the year. Here then will be the lever to force the communities to make the necessary expenditures and do the re quired work to make and keep up good roads all tl)e year around. Major John B. Jeffery, who will rec ommend the establishment of seven additional rural mail routes in Wapel lo county, in addition to the three that are now in operation in the count), has conditioned this recowmendation upon the roads traversed by the rdiltae being put in good repair and so kept at aU seasons of the year. We want to say t-bat Major Jeffery has, in ow opinion, the right conception in rogtmi to fcUe »ee delivery eer yiooi thal the people Who, SSilF^-' Su '-i.'Trwv: Semi-Weekly Courier want it should have free delivery ot mail, provided they are willing to com ply with certain necessary conditions in order to make the system complete and put it In first class shape from the starkly Every route laid- out by Major Jeftery 'hi this county,' and so far .as we know, wherever he goes, starts out with at least one hundred families served, who are provided with uni form locked mail boxes erected on posts of a specified size, all of which are neatly painted and numbered. Major Jeftery also enlists and se cures the hearty cooperation of the boards of supervisors of the various counties, thus bringing important In fluences to bear in the line of secur ing good roads and strictly first class service. .As an instance of this good work on' the part of this special agent of the postoffice department/ we note the fol lowing resolutions yesterday adopted by the board of supervisors of Wa pello county which mean a great deal for the future of good roads in this county. Resolutions Adopted by the Board of Supervisors of Wapello County. Whereas, the postoffice department has extended to the residents of Wa» pello county the rural free delivery system, Special Agent John B. Jeftery having recommended the establish ment of seven routes in addition to the three already established, this recommendation being conditioned upon the roads traversed by the routes being put in good repair, and being so kept at all seasons of the year, and Whereas, we recognize the force and importance of the declaration by the Honora'Je Postmaster General, in his annual report to congress, that "good roads are an essential condition of the service." Resolved, by the board of supervis ors of Wapello county, Iowa, that the county bridges and the approaches thereto, and all road work under the control of the board of supervisors, will be put in first class condition and will be so maintained, and that this board will exercise its influence with the road district supervisors to see that all roads are properly worked and kept in good traveling condition at all seasons of the year. Ottumwa, Iowa, Dec. 10, 1900. Mrs. Sarah Kuhn, of the village of Delta, is on trial charged -with the murder of her husband in September. It is alleged that there is a man in tVu1 case, which alleged fact the state will attempt to prove. In a murder case a motive is always sought, and many tirpes the conclusions arrived at are ir.cofrect. At best a motive for a crime, unless confessed by a culprit, is but the outcome of a course of rea soning in one man's brain, and may be far from the truth. No man is infalli ble and a state's attorney is just as liable to reach an incorrect conclusion as any citizen, even tho he has had experience in "criminology." America is helping China out of its trouble in this crisis, and is incidental ly rescuing all of China's enemies from an embarrassing and dangerous position. The Washington govern ment has won. laurels in.this Chinese matter, which the country will be bet ter able to appreciate"-after the epi sedf, ends than it can now. In foreign as well as in domestic politics the ad ministration has won credit for the country Somebody has said that this is a great year for the farmer. In fact it has been said a great many times but the estimate of Director Sage, of the Iowa Weather, and Crop Service, that the tctal value of all crops produced in Iowa the past seaBori amounts to $102 for every inhabitant in the state would indicate that the statement is not lacking in proof. gMNH 1 1
