Webb, our circuit judge, is generally and favorably mentioned for the office of Chief Justice in place of Justice Cole, whose term expires next year. While we have no knowledge of Judge Webb’s wishes in the mat ter, we do know that the members j of the bar of this and adjoining j circuits who have had occasion to practice in his courts are unani- 1 V. . . rnous in pronouncing him a very able judge, and that he would have i their support for the above named position. He is now' completing his second , term, and last spring was unani mously elected for a third term as I judge of this circuit, and lus nom ination now for Chief Justice would meet with the general approval of the bar and the people of this part of the state. Commissioner of Pensions Raum reports a deficiency of $32,000,000 in the allowance for pensions. Mr. J. W. Babcock, of Necedah, was elected to the assembly over K. D.

Tab Pryor, formerly night-watch in the city of Waupaca, was arrested lately charged with the murder of H. C. Mead, October Bth, 1882. The warrant was issued on complaint of Messrs. Wm.

Press: Two years ago Morgan, the democratic can didate for Governor received 430 votes in Adams county. This year Peck, the candidate of the same party for Governor, received 292 votes in the county. It will puzzle even a democrat to figure gains out of these figures. Tuesday morning’s Sentinel con tained the information that the Milwaukee election returns were wrongly canvassed and might be refused by the State Canvassing Board. It appears that the can vassing board of Milwaukee county' was made up of two justices of the peace and a private citizen. We will await further results. PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. Speaker Reed, as tlic hands on the big clock facing him indicated noon, called the House to order and formally declared the second session of the Fifty-first Congress opened and ready for business. After prayer by the Chaplain the President’s message was received. When the clerk began reading the message many of the members were listless or intent upon reading newspapers or writing letters; but as the burning words of patriotism and party loyalty, which not even the sing-song tones of the profess ional reader could make dull, be gan to pour forth every form was erect and the closest attention was paid to every word. Speaker Reed’s face was a study as the read ing of the message proceeded. He smiled most expressively, and from time to time nodded his head in a manner which said as plain as any thing could “those arc my senti ments;’’ and occasionally brought his hands together, as if to con gratulate himself for being a mem ber of the same party as the man who could write such a ringing and timely message just after his party had been defeated. The democrats too paid close attention to the reading of the mes sage, but their faces did not beam with satisfaction at the strong points as did those of the republi cans. Republicans are all con gratulating the President, and the opinion is universal among them that the message is one of the best ever sent to congress; and it is no exaggeration to say that it has made Mr. Harrison more popular with republicans in both branches of congress than he has ever been before, and the party leaders ex press the belief that it will put an affective quietus upon the small, very small minority of the party in congress that lost their heads over the result of the late elections to such an extent as to be willing to abandon one of the cardinal principles of the republican party in order to carry favor in certain quarters. It is now an absolute certainty that no backward steps will be taken by the republicans during this session of Congress. The cry is “forward, forward,” and the marching will be done to the same old party music that has led the party to its greatest triumphs in the past, which will be repeated in the future, just as certain as intel ligence always in the course of time gets the best of ignorance. The republicans are still in control of both branches of Congress, and republican ideas will dominate all the legislation passed between this and the fourth day of next March, and in spite of democratic threats, howls and piteous appeals the original republican programme, mapped out long before the elec tions, is to be carried out to the letter.
