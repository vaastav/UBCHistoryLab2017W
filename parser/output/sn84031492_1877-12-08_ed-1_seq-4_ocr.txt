One hnndred dollars In gold would buy $102.75 In greenbacks at tbetlose. Greenbacks nt the New York Slock Ex change yesterday closed nt 07g. Comptroller Knox yesterday stated that bo should probably not appoint a Receiver for the German National Bank of Chicago be lieving that the bank will bo able to pay oil its liabilities. This view is concurred in by tbo baftkers of Chicago and by all who aro in a position to judge of tho probabilities. , Friends of Mr. Cokbuno indignantly deny that he has received with favor advances from Mr. Evabts looking to the bestowal of Now York patronage in return for tho former’s support of the Administration. Friends of the Administration should lose no time in denying that any discreditable advances wore over made. Senator Davis, of Illinois, is a firm be liever in tho Silver bill, and is confident it will poos the Senate by a heavy vote.' Ho assumes that every Senator is in favor of tho bill in some form who voted to make it the special order for Tuesday, and is evidently encouraged to hope that the bill may receive tho necessary two-thirds vote in the event of a veto. It tarns out that William 0. Oilman, tho forger and swindler now serving out a sen tence in tho Now York Penitentiary, was a member of the Grand Jury that returned tho indictment upon which Hookbt L. Cask, President of tho Security Life-Insurance Company, was convicted and sentenced. This fact ought to have a place among the white marks In Oilman’s prison account. The proposed amendment to the fire ordi nance permitting tho unlimited erection of wooden buildings not over two stories high 13 os to form a continuous cordon of combus tible material around three sides of the city was discussed yesterday by the Committee on Streets and Alleys, and was finally re ferred back to tho Common Connell without recommendation. The amendment amounts to a practical repeal of the fire ordinance, and ought to be promptly voted down by tho Council. Defeated candidates usually find it up hill work collecting damages of newspapers which ventilate their records for the enlight enment of the voters. Mr. Bailbt, of Kala mazoo, who recently ran for office in that sity, undertook a levy of #30,000 upon the TtUgraph on account ol some damaging dls sloaares which appeared in that journal, but the jury, after bearing the evidence, failed to perceive wherein the character of tho gentleman was injured unjustly, and brought In a verdict for the defendant. Cx*UJnlster Wasusunxs’s lecture on 11 The Siege end Commulie of Paris," delivered last Bveuiog at the Tabernacle, attracted and in. '.crested a very large audience. It was an able and impartial review of the series of »vonta beginning with the declaration of war by Nipolion 111. against Germany, includ log the reginu of the Commune in Paris, and ending with the entry of the German army into the French Capital. As liberal au sb* ■tract of the lecture as oar space will allow is given elsewhere in this issue. The Turks aro trying desperately to re lieve Osman Pasha’s army, which is cooped up in Plevna. If the Osar’s army, which has surrounded it, forces it to surrender, the road to Constantinople through the western passes of the Balkans will be open. tioLxiUAJf Pasha, whose base is the powerful fortress of Bbomla on the east, is operating with a relieving army against the Russian forces under the Emperor’s son. If he can break it, he hopes to strike the army which invests Osmax Pasha at Plevna. Suuuuax Pasha has about 85,000 men, and the Rus sian force which he is assailing numbers per haps CO,OOO, but they fight on the defensive. and it will cost the Turku dearly to drive them hack. Bat oven suppose they were driven back upon the linos of tho Investing army, eonld Suleiman thou raise tho siege ? Could tho two separated Turkish armies defeat tho combined Russian army ? One thing is certain, that Osman Pasha’s forces must soon be relieved or they must surrender, as they are nearly out of provis ions. They may have scanty food for a fort night longer, but tho catastrophe approaches daily and inexorably. Sdleiuan may gain some advantages over the Czarowieh, but it Is hardly possible that ho can gain so decisive a victory as will enable him to raise tfaesiege and relieve Osman Pasha’s beleaguered army, which is being slowly starved into surrender. It is related in tho Washington dispatches that a friendly interview recently took place between the President and Senator Patter on, at tho request of the former. Accord ing to all accounts, Patterson was consider ate enough of the President’s feelings to moke no reference to tho obnsivo por tions of his Senate speech, and it is to bo presumed that tho President, not to bo outdone in delicate considera tion, made no reference to the yawning portals of the South Carolina Penitentiary, Patterson insisted that tho President hod destroyed the Republican party In Sonth Carolina, and the President insisted that ho had done nothing of the sort. Harmony being thus happily restored, It may bo sup posed that the interview terminated in the same spirit of friendship and mutual regard in which it was begun. A serious and probably fatal bitch has oc eurred in tho negotiations for the formation of a Ministry satisfactory to tho Loft. Mao- Maqon, presumably swayed by tho appeals of tho Clericals and Bonapartlsts against the complete surrender implied in tbo an. thority given H. Dufaure to organize a Parliamentary Cabinet, seems to have recanted at the last moment, and now insists upon reserving to himself tho sclec lion of tho three most Important Ministers— those of Foreign Affairs, War, and Marine. Dufavoe would listen to np proposition that contemplates the placing of three Cabinet colleagues beyond his control, and promptly withdrew from tho negotiations. M. Batbib has now been assigned tho office of patching up a hybrid Ministry, but there is no pros pcct that tho suddenly-conceived reserva tions of tho President will bo tolerated by tho Loft, or that au adjustment acceptable to tho Chamber of Deputies will bo ac compllslied. THE NATIONAL BAVINQ3-DEJPOSITS. Now that Secretary Sbkbman lias drawn at tention to tho obvious necessity of a national system for the safe-keeping of tho surplus earnings of tho working classes, Congress will scarcely neglect to take the subject under advisement and discuss the means best adapted to the end in view. Secretary Sheehan's recommendation of such a system is hosed upon a popular demand that has been generally expressed since tho many savings-bank failures of the past year, and upon tho snocossfnl experience of other Gov ernments, where Jt bos long been the cus tom to provide a national guarantee for de posits of a savings character. Mr. Sheehan says in bis report t The attend on of Congress Is called to the (treat value to nor fellow-citizens of the organisation of Bomoplan for the collection, safe-keeping. end profltaolo employment of small pleposlta by the people. How far tbla can be done without trench* Ins upon tho proper functions of the State Govern* moot la a question of difficulty; yet It la Important to secure, If possible, a general system throughout the United States. This can hardly be effected by the organisation of a multitude of savings banka, depending upon the fidelity, Integrity, and skill of tnelr officers, but the beneficial objects of such banks might be secured by authorising tho deposit of small sums with any postal money-order office In the United States, and the Issue of Government certificates, convertible on demand of the holder Into 4 per ceut bonds of tho United States of •neb character, description, and amount as will enable and induce prudent persona to convert their cantina Into a pnbllo security of stablo value. The money thos received could be era ployed In the redemption of outstanding bonds bearing a higher rate of Interest. Uy some such system It Is believed that the great body of our public debt, reduced loitasmallest possible harden, could be distributed among oar own people. With a slight modification of existing law this beneficial result would be secured. The deposits now held by aavlmra banks throughout the country amount tolfrta. 104.804, deposited by 2,1100,000 persons, and mostly by deserving citizens, who thus wisely seek to preserve small savings for future need. No object could more strongly appeal to the consider* ate Judgment of Congress. The heavy losses that havo Itceo sustained through savings banks, whose funds have been Improvldcnfly loaned upon Insuf • fide at security, have Indicted- far greater Injury npon the depositors than would a similar lost suf fered by persons engaged la banking arcommerclat pursuits. Tho Secretary, therefore, recommends that authority be granted to Issue certificates for small deposits, convertible Into 4 per cent bonds now authorised by law, the pioeeuda to bo used solely for the redemption of bonds hearing a higher rate of interest, and now redeemable at par. Tho system recommended by the Secre tary of the Treasury is, to all intents and purposes, tbo English system, leaving the details to bo adjusted to tbo working of the departments to which It will be attached. It bos been suggested that a system of bonk ing in vogae in certain parts of Germany might supply the need. Under the German system the deposits are guaranteed by the Government, which oppoiuts the officers of the bonks; a regular linking business is done, loaning by preference to the deposit ors, who are likewise in some sense stock holders, os the Interest they receive on their deposits Is regulated by the profits on the business. It la apparent, however, that such a system would be attended by great risks under our form of Government. A banking business, done under the auspices of the Government, and depending for its honesty and intelligent manage ment upon officials appointed under the usaal political Influences, would not be so safe as the private savings-banks system which is now so generally condemned. Par tisan favoritism would induct incompetent men into the control of tbo banks and lead to the negotiation of bod loans on worthless securities; to moke the Government respon sible for deposits subject to this sort of ma nipulation would simply be to Impoee.npon it an annual burden of defalcations and losses. No system can be adopted'wbich in volves the necessity of the Government, di rectly or by agents, doing anything like a banking business. It is simply a question of affording absolute safekeeping for sav iugs-deposits, and paying a small interest thiireoo, without incurring loss or risk on the part of either the Government or the de positors. The fact that tho Government is a large borrower, and mast of necessity continue to be so for on indefinite period, offers the op portunity for the proposed system of safe keeping of deposits. Be ore lory Bumas states that tho aavlngs-deposits of the coun try amount (o nearly $850,000,000; bat this is not one-balf the amount which the Gov - eminent owes, so that the entye sum of - savinge-depewits coaid bo taken by the Gov ernment without any loss. In fact, there THU 

UHIUAUO TRIBUNE: SATURDAY. DECEMBER 8, 1877-TWELVE FADES. would bo a decided gain for the Government, inasmuch as tho deposits dr savings-bonds would draw only 4 per cent interest, while tho Government would lake up with tho fnnds thus acquired the bonds oh which it is paying ft and ft per cent interest Tho savings of the French people are largely in vested in what are called the “ popular loans,” which is merely another designation for aavings-bonds; in France H has proved a national blessing to have tho Govern, ment debt held by the people, and this is what tho proposed national savings-syslem in this country would load to. It will not bo ncoossary for the Government to hold a large idle fund of money as a reserve where, with to meet the withdrawal of deposits. There will be no panics to contend with when the savings are intrusted with the Gov. eminent, but os a rule tbo current deposits will bo amplo to provide for all the current withdrawals. As an instance of this, it may be mentioned that tho National Banks bavo only been required to keep a reserve of ft per cent as a for their cirenlaU ing notes, which ore protected by Govern ment bonds. No matter how many National Banks suspend, no bolder of Notional Bank notes feels a tremor or oven looks to see whether any of h!s notes ore on tho suspended banks; the 5 per cent redemption is sufficient to take care of all the current demands for redemption, and the bonds are converted in case of suspension as voluntary retirement by any particular bank. There would bo tho same universal and perfect confidence among, depositors with tho Gov. eminent; anything like a ran for the with drnwal of funds could never occur; a very small reserve would be ample guarantee for all demands for money, and the groat bulk of tho deposits (perhaps 05 per cent) wonld go into 4 per cent bonds, either by the vol. uutary conversion of the depositors, or by tho action of tbo Government in taking np ft , per cents and ft per cents with money on which it would be paying only 4 per cent in. terest. The funds in tho hands of tho Postal Agents receiving the deposits would not be nearly so largo as would appear at first thought, and neither the temptation nor op portunity for frauds and defalcations would bo materially increased. There is one phase of the proposed legis lation which should be kept well in mind. There is nothing compulsory about tho sys tern that will at all interfere with savings banks as a private business, except in so far as the Government facilities offer a greater inducement in tho absolute guarantee of safe keeping. Tho private bonks may go on os be fore, offering 5 per cent or ft per cent interest, or any amount they choose, and all those tempted by the promise of a higher rote Will be at liberty to deposit with them. But then tbo risk will rest exclusively with those who take it, and there can bo no outcry that the laws are deficient’ in falling to provide a means for tho safe-keeping of surplus earn lags. Every man, woman, and child will bo duly informed that they can deposit their savings with the Government at 4 per cent, and that they can withdraw their money or convert it without notice or delay ; if under these circumstances their desire for more rapid accumulation prompt them to trust private bonkers, It is a matter of business risk for which they alone will bo responsible. Just now, we fancy, tho bulk of tho savings would go into the Government’s hands. THE SILVER BILL IN THE SENATE. The preliminary rotes on the Silver bill In the Senate leave no doubt that a largo mo* jority of thft body is in favor of tho passage of the bill. That question being determined, tho other ono arises, Will tho President veto tho bill? It is not often that a President has the opportunity, or, having it, avails himself of it, to inform Oongrcss of his per* sonal opinions as to the expediency of a measure. In this coso tho President, in his annual message, laid before Congress in strong and unmistakable language his objec tions to a bill which had already passed one House by a four-ill tbs vot e and was then ponding in tho other House. The theory of a veto is, that the President, in returning a bill without his approval, may give such reasons for his negative that members of Congress shall be influenced to vote dif ferently after hearing these - reasons than they voted on tho first occasion. In this case, however, tho President’s objections have been heard in advance. He and the Secretary of the Treasury have in foot ex hausted their reasoning in opposition to tho bill, and a veto message with any expecta tion of changing votes will be a vain de lusion. Bo vain woald such a proceeding be, that it is more than likely that should the bill pass the Senate by a two-thirds vote, tho President would coniine his action to a protest such os other Presidents "have done under similar circumstances. Should he, however, veto the bill, what are the pros pects of Its receiving the two-thirds vote necessary to make It a law 7 With the ad mission of Eoaris, of Louisiana, the Senate will consist of seventy-six members, and, if oil ora present, fifty-one votes will be re quired to pass a bill over a veto. The Sena tors have, by their votes and otherwise, nearly ail expressed an opinion on this ques tion, and tho Senators may bo classified as for or ogoinst the Silver bill as follows i Statu.
