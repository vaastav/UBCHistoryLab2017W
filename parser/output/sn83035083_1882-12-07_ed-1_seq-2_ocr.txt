SHOCKING AFFAIR ! Frank i'rayne Miases tnc Apple, and Snoots Miss Von Herclin tl.ro oi; I. the Head, Killing; Her Instantly. Cincinnati, November 80th. This ' afternoon at the Coliseuhi Theater, in the fourth act of the play, Si Slocum, i Frank Frayne, in shooting an apple off the head of Ruth Slocum, person ated by Miss Annie Von Behren, miss ed theapple and shot Miss Von Behren in the head. She died in fifteen min utes. Frayne was arrested immedi ately. The curtain fell and the play stoppen. The audience supposed the victim was only slightly hurt. Frayne used a rille of 82-eaithre, and execu ting a backward shot. The catch snap of the rifle was imperfect, nn I slipped just as the hammer fell and blew the cartridges out backwards. Wheu the curtain went down, after the fatal shot, excitement behind the scenes was so great as to create alarm lest a panic might ensue among the audience of 2300. Fray ue's cries and lamentations were so violent that he was heard before the curtain. Manager Fennessy was too much excited to say anything, but he sent a friend to the front to say that the accident was slight, and that tlie play would not proceed farther. The audience then retired in order, though one lidy fainted. Manager Fennessy took charge f Frayne, and though the latter de manded to be locked up, he got Mr H. Heuck to go betore Judge Higley, of the Police Court, and give bond for Dis release from arrest. The bond was fixed at $5,000. Frayne's mental con dition was such that one or two of his friends kept a close watch over him at his hotel. The theater closed tonight and nrobablv will not be opened this week. A coroner viewed the body of Miss Von Behren, and it was then removed to the undertaker's, where it will lie until word is received from her friends in Brooklyn. It is said sbe was en gaged to be married shortly to Frayne. The cause of the accident was the low ering of the barrel by a fault in the spring catch. Frayne's shirt was burned by the powder, and a part of the shell was driven backward. The ball entered the forehead two Inches above the left eye and half an inch to the left of the median line. The apple on her head rested on a hat, aud the bottom of the apple was four inches above the girl's head, though with the make up of her hair and hat it appeared mucli nearer. The shot was Frayne's usual back shot, using the mirror. The place where the ball struck the j'irl's forehead was in a plumb line below the center of the apple. The rille used was a 32-calibre breech loader cartridge ritle, of the J. Stevens pattern, Blade for Frank Frayne, and used by him six years in this act. He says the spring catch, near the breech of the barrel which holds it down, after loading broke or failed, and that the stroke of the ham mer on the cartridge threw the breech up aud depressed the muzzle at the moment of liriug so as to throw the ball downward. About six years ago, at Wood's Theater, iu the same piece, with his wife, who has since died, acting the part of " Ruth Slocum," he shot one of the stage stipes in the foot. The rifle was an old fashioned Ken tucky gun, and the ball, before strik ing the man's foot, passed through the apple and a heavy butt of oak wood placed behind it to stop it. He then explained how careful he was in ex amining his rifle on such occasions, and how safe it was iu his bauds ; ami how he used to employ a navy revolv er aud shoot apples oil' several people's head till the authorities forbade it. He also explained that out of sight of the audience the breech of his gun was held tight to the proscenium jamb by a clamp aud screw, which he carried for that purpose. It appears that he omitted this precaution of late. Pop ular feeling here is sympathetic with the man, but bitter against his busi ness. Fraynesays he will never shoot again. Annie Von Behren was the leading laiiy of the Company, and was less than twenty-live years of age. Her native place was Brooklyn, and she had been on the stage about three years. The Coliseum Theater is closed tonight, of course. oiu ; a it hi: i to siuin.n MBSET! mi iu i' Secret llifctorr of I lie Mar lloule 'Iron lilea. Special to the Plain Dealer. St. Louis, December 4 An edito rial letier in the Post-Dispatch from Washington, written by Jos Pulitzer, referring to the Star Route matters, aud especially to Stephen VV. Dorsey, gives some se'-ret history of the case, obtained, the writer says, from per fecily authoritative though confiden tial sources. When it was first known that Mr. McVeagh really meant, to have Dor y indicted ind presented. Dorsey came from bis sheep rauebe in New Mexico . and went to the White House. General Garfield told Dorsey not to give himself any uneasiness about the outcome, but to return to his raiiehe and feel sure that he (Gar field) would be his friend ; but iu spite of all this McVeagh proceeded with his ease. A retained detective and special counsel collected testimony ami drew, upon piomise of immunity, from a smaller member of the ring, a con fession of guilt which was sure to con vict Dorsey. Alarmed by the reports of McVeagh's doings, Dorsey returned iu the Spring of 1881 to the l,ast. While in New York Mr. McVeagh ictu tliy procured a warrant (or Dor- sfiy's arreet. The warrant v:is utiooi lo he issued, but Horsey had his secret agents everywhere, and bo beard ol tne move by telegraph. He saw his peril. There was only one man who could save h;m. He took the next train to Washington and arrived there late at night. He went from the de pot to the White House ami appealed to Garfield to save him. Garfield then sent for McVeagh. What there ensued may be inferred from the fact thai ttie warrant for Dorsey s arrest was never served, but withdrawn. The incident is historical, and known to be true by Blaine. It lias never been published, but it is true, and McVeagh will not dare to deny it. i mMM THE North Side Rolling Mills, at Chicago, have shut down for want of work, throwing out of employment 1,800 to 2,000 men, The opinion gen erally prevails that the talk about shutting down in the iron and steel works of the country is a scheme got up for the purpose of causing a drop in wages and the price of coal and pig iron, and to frighten Congress into continuing the present exorbitant du ties, or to still further increase the bur thens of the people. But whatever may be the cause ol the scare, it is ipiite manifest that the high tariff tax which now prevails, and which there is little or no prospect of being chang- pl for a year or so, affords no " pro tection" to the thousands of working men who are tli row n out of employ ment whenever there is a panic in the country.

N. Y. Herald, November lti. SBAtll ON 

POUTEB. It has been known for some time past that General I r. S. Grant, having studied the case of General Filz John Porter, concluded that the charges against General Porter were untenable. In this the ex-President but followed the findings of the Scbofield Board. A sense of the long injustice under which General Porter has suffered for now a score of years has stimulated General Grant to publish an article in which he gives the grounds for his present opinion. Of this article but the main points can be given here. Says General (Irani : "General Porter's alleged miscon duct was embraced in three separate cases of disobedience of orders one on the :27th of August and two on the 29tb of August - and in having retreat -edinue .cssarily from the enemy, by that endangering other portions of the army With which be was co-operating. It will be seen that though the offenses were alleged to have beeu committed in August of 1801!, he was continued in command of an army corps until some time in November following, taking an active part in the battles of the day following the date of the last charge, and in command of the defenses of Washington ou the west bank of the Potomac, and also at the battle of Au tietam, some weeks later. It would look at first very singular that an offi cer so wantonly derelict iu the per formance of lfts duty as General Porter was alleged to have been ou the 27th and 29th of August, should have been continued in so important a place of command as an army corps, when so much was at stake as there was on the 30th of August, aud in the defenses of Washington, aud iu the later battles in Maryland when the invasion of the North was threatened. These facts would indicate to au unprejudiced mind that the charges against Porter were au aftef-thought to shift the re sponsibilities of failure from other shoulders aud to place them upon him" General Grant then reviews the facts brought out iu the evidence before the Scbofield Board with characteristic directness aud cogency. In the course of his review he says : 'A literal obedience to the order of the 27th of August was a physical im possibility. It is further shown that General Porter was desirous of obeying it literally, so far as was practicable, but was prevailed upon by his leading Generals against whom a suspicion of disloyalty to their commander or to the cause has never beeu entertained to do what his own judgment approved as the best thing to do ; to make a later start with a view of arriving at his destination as early as it was possi ble for him to arrive there, and to give his jaded and worn troops two hours more of ueeded rest." On this point the following state ment from General Grant is oi great significance : " 1 question very much whether there was au engagement during the w ir, or a series of engagements, con tinuing over as much time as was con sumed in the battles about Bull Ruu In August, 1802, wheu not only one but a number of Generals did not ex ercise their discretion as Porter did ou this occasion, aud with far less justifi cation," With regard to the second case namely, the first or joint order of the 2'.th of August, "to establish commu nication with Pope. the fact that Porter was left with 10,000 men to face Lougstreet, newly arrived in his front with 2o. 000 men, whom Pope believed to lie far distant, is sufficient to account tor the order not being obeyed. Fur ther, so successfully did Porter engage Lougstreet that the latter was caused ' to take Wilcox's Division from in front of Pope iu order to strengthen the line confronting Porter." " Thus," says General Gtaut, " Por ter, without sacrifice of meu aud with out eudaugeriug auy interests, did more for Pope's relief than if lie had gone directly to that General's assist ance. To have done so would proba bly have sacrificed his corps without any benefit, aud jeopardized the Safety of Pope's army. So far as I have in vestigated the case and I have studied it, I think, pretty thoroughly I see no tact to base the charge of retreat upon. 1 do not see that any argument to prove this is necessary, because any reader of history may be defied now to find where and when General Porter retreated during the t ime specified." Upon the " 4:30 p. m. order" Gener al tyrant enters into fuller detail, as this ' is the principal one aud the one that baa most deeply impressed the general public." As maintained by i he prosecution In the court-martial of : SG2, to the apparent satisfaction Of the Court, the situation of the beligereut forces vas on that day, iu numbers and position, as follows, namely : Pope, with 33,000 men, facing Jackson, with 22,0 H) men, while Porter, with 10,000 men, was drawn up obliquely across Jackson's right llauk, Porter's right being towards Pope's left. With this alleged disposition of the forces there was some color iu the opinion which held Porter responsible for hot, attack ing the "enemy's llauk and rear." But the facts now accessible to the world, aud known at the time to Gen eral Porter, show that the actual situ ation was, says General Grant, as shown iu tlie following diagram : As shown by this diagram. General Grant continues, Porter was not in a position to attack the right flank of Jack-on, because he was at least three TOi lei- away and not across his flank as claimed at the court martial. With Longstreel's piis -nce, to have obeyed that older lit would have been obliged with 10,000 men, to have defeated 25,000 mi n n a rho.-et position before he could have moved upon the llauk of the enemy, as the order directed. Re marking upon Geuer&h Porter's appli cation, now before Congress, asking thai be may bo restored to the rolls of the army with the rank that he would have if the court martial had never been held," General Grant says: ' This, in my judgment, is a small part of what, it is possible to do iu this case and of what ought to be done. General Porter should, iu the way of partial restitution, be declared by Cou gress lohave been convicted on mista ken testimony, and, therefore, to have never been out of the army, This would make him a Major General of volunteers until the date might be fix- d for his muster outas of that rank after which he should be continued as a Colonel of Infantry and Brevet Brigadier Grueral of the United States Army from the date of the act, when he should be placed upon the retired list with that rank." General Grant explains that he means no criticism upon the Court which tried General Porter, nor upon the officers with whom he served." It is easy to understand how in 1862, under severe reverses iu the field, the public were ready to condemn to death if d ed he auy officer against whom even a suspicion might be raised. Till within a year Grant himself be lieved the judgment on General Porter was just. In conclusion, Geueral Grant says, iu words we cannot refrain from quoting : " If a solemn and sincere expression of my thorough understanding aud be lief in the entire innocence of General Porter will tend to draw the public mind to the same conviction, I shall feel abundantly rewarded for my efforts It will always be a pleasure to me as well as a duty, to be the instrument, even in the smallest degree, of setting right any man who has been grossly wronged, especially if he has risked life and reputation iu defense of his cauntry. I feel, as stated on a previ ous occasion, a double interest in this particular case, because directly after. the war, as General of the Army, when I might have been instrumental iu having justice done to General Porter, I and later, as President of the United States, when I certainly could have done so, I labored under the firm con viction that he was guilty ; that the facts of the receipt of the .30 oWer were as found by the Court, 'and that I the position of the troops aud.u umbers ! were as given in the first of these dia- grams. Having become better inform i ed, I at once voluntarily gave, as I have I continued to give, my earnest efforts j to impress the minds of my country men with the justice of this case, and I to secure from our government, as far as it could grant It, the restitution due to General Filz John Porter." The (iarfield Claim. Washington, December 2. Claims were allowed by the Garfield Board of Audit as follows : Professional services of Bliss, $0,500; Agnew and Hamil ton, $5,000 each ; Reyburu and Boyn ton, $4,000 eac i ; Edson, $3,000. The bills for services aud supplies were all settled, as were also the bills for the extra services of the Government em ployes, Stewart! ( 'rump being allowed but $;u0, Private Secretary Pruden $200, etc. The total appropriation to pay the claims against the estate was $57,500, of which $35,500 was specially appropriated lor the physicians, etc. The amount was $8,000 less than the amount appropriated, aud the allow ances for outside claims are about $4,000 less than the amount .available, making a total balance of about $19,000 out of the entire appropriation. Protection. One of thestrougest points Gen. Butler made in his canvass of Massachusetts was his exposure of the humbug of protection. The workiugmen of Low -ell cheered him to the echo when he showed them how that they all paid twice the value of every garment they woae, in order to enrich the manufac turing monopolists. His victory, there fore, means a good deal more than than Republican dissatisfaction with the machine. It is significant of an awakening of the people to one of the greatest fallacies that ever beguiled in telligent meu. Brooklyn Eagle. One day last week Governor Foster called several times at the White House, but was unable to obtain an audience with the President, who was engaged iu writing his annual message, aud Foster leit for New York on rail road business. It is said his missiou was to protest against Marshal Hen ry's removal. He considers it unjusti fiable. He considers Henry innocent. He thinks, however, that Arthur had to choose between losing Brewster aud losiug Henry, and that under the cir cumstances he acted wisely. The Marshal himself keeps a stiff upper lip, aud very sensibly declines ,to talk for publication.

RANDOLPH. Correspondence. On Saturday last Mr. John Bill, was digging in a well for Mr. Eugene White, when a two-years old colt, in attempting to leap across the top, fell Into the well and onto Mr. Riltz. The well was about twenty feet deep. Mr. Riltz was considerably bruised, but not so bad as he might have been un der the circumstances. He succeeded in getting out without receiving any broken bones. The colt was not bro't out alive. In its struggles it caused the dirt to cave In until it was nearly coveted, only its head and neck being free. The pressure soon put an end to its life. It seems some horses in the same field with the colt chased it aud caus -d it to take the fatal leap. Mrs. Libbie Conrad lost, the past week, a valuable horse. The animal ran against some sharp pointed object. cutting a severe gash iu its body, from which it died. Mr. Adam Shultz, in the south part of the township, also lost a valuable horse from some peculiar disease. It is said the animal held its head high and would walk over or against every thing that came iu its way. Mies Mary York returned home from Farmingtou. She will remain during the Church revival which is in pro gress here. She assists at the organ, and after the revival here she will en gage in the same work elsewhere. Dec. 4th, 1882. V Thanksgiving service was held in the Disciple Church. Service opened with singing by the choir, followed by the reading of the 147 Ps, by Rev. J. Redinger. Rev. Mr. Moore, of the M. E. Church, spoke from the text : " He hath not dealt so with any nation," a part of the 20th verse of 147 Ps. He spoke of this as being pre-eminently a Christian nation, recognizing God, as the giver and dispenser of all good, both temporal and spiritual ; a people recognizing this fact, aud as loyal citi zens, it was fit that they should come together iu accordance with the proe'.a mation of the President aud the Gov ernor to render thanks for the many blessings we have enjoyed as a nation during the past year. He spoke of the abundant harvest as being more than was expected. That this country was rapidly approaching the time when it would be the store house of nations from which they would draw largely their supplies ; of thecommercial pros perity of the people and the stability of our institutions. We had abundant reason to be thankful for the manner iu which the people, in the majesty of their power had rebuked and crushed machines, combinations and cliques, which had endeavored lo control and shape the pclitical affairs of the country There had been no retrograde move ment in the churches, but a steady ad vance all along the line. What many mistook for infidelity was nothing more than the reaching out of the mind after new truths and the rejec tion of many things which had been taught in the past, but no Bible truth had beeu rejected. It was a very ap propriate and excellent discourse for the occasion. We have only hinted at some of the leading thoughts, without trying to give the connection or lan guage of the speaker.
