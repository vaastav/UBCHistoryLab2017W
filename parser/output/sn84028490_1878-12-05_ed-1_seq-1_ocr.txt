.. HMM)m.W VOL. 45. NO. 27 CANTON, OHIO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER, 5 1878 WM. McClECOR Fublhhu MR. HAYES'S MESSAGE. HE FLUTTERS SLIGHTLY THE BLOODY SHIRT. Advises Money Matters be Left by Congress to John Shermanâ€”And dodges Committal on the Indian Transfer. Fellow Citvstnt oj the Senate and House oBepresen tattm ; Our heartfelt gratitude Is due to the Divine Be ing, who holda In his bands the destinies of na tions, for the continued bestowal, during the last year, of countless blessings upon our country. We are at peace with all other nations. Our publlo credit has greatly Improved, and It, per haps, now stronger than ever before. Abundant harvests have rewarded the labors ef those who till the soil, our manufacturing Industries are re viving, and it Is believed that general prosperity, whloh has been so long anxiously looked for, la at last within our reach, YELLOW FEVER. The enjoyment of health by our people gener. ally has, however, been Interrupted, during the past season, by the prevalence of a fatal pestilence the yellow fever, In some portions of the Southern States, creating an emergency which called for prompt and extraordinary measures of relief. The disease appeared as an epidemic at New Orleans and at other places on the lower Mississippi, soon after mid summer. It was rapidly spread by fugi tives from the Infected cltle and towns, and did not disappear until early In November. The States of Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee have suf fered severely, About one hundred thousand cases are believed to have occurred, of which about twenty thousand, aooordlng to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It la Impossible to esti mate with any approach to accuracy the loss to the country occasioned by this epidemic, It is to be reckoned by the hundred millions of dollars' The suffering and destitution that resulted excit ed the deepest sympathy In all parts of the Union. Physicians and nurses hastened from every quar ter to the assistance of the afflicted communities. Voluntary contribution of money and supplies, in every needed form, were Bpeedlly and gener ously furnished. The Government was able to re spond In some measure to the call for help, by providing tents, medicines and food for the sick and destitute, the requisite directions lor the pur pose being given, In the confident expectation that this action of the Executive would receive the sanction of Congress. About eighteen hun dred tents, and rations of the value of about twenty-five thousand dollars, were sent to cities and towns which applied for them, full details of which will be furnished to Congress by the proper de partment, . The fearful spread of this pestilence has awak ened a very general public sentiment In favor of national sanitary administration, which shall not only control quarantine, but have the sanitary supervision of Internal commerce In times of epl domlos, and bold an advisory relation to the State and municipal health authorities, with power to deal with whatever endangers the public health, and whloh the mnnlolpal and State authorities re nnable to regulate. The national quarantine act approved April 29, 1878, which was passed too late In the last session of Congress to provide the meane for carrying It Into practical operation, daring the past season, Is a step in the direction bore lndloated. In view of the necessity for the most effective measures, by quarantine and oth erwise, for the protection of our seaports, and the country generally, from this and other epidemics, It Is recommended that Congress give the whole ubjeot early and careful consideration, THE SOUTHERN POLICY. The permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection of all citizens In every 1t11 and political right continues to be of para mount interest with the great body of our people, Every step In this direction la welcomed with public approval, and every interruption of steady and uniform progress to the desired consumma Hon awakens general uneasiness and wide spread condemnation. The recent Congressional elec' tloni have furnished ( direct and trustworthy test of the advance thus far mane in tne practical establishment of the right of suffrage, secured by the Constitution to the liberated race In the South ern States. All disturbing Influences, road or Imaginary, had been removed lrom all ot these mate. The three constitutional amendments, which conferred freedom and equality or elvll and pom leal rights noon the colored people of the South. were adopted by the concurrent action of the great body or good citizens wno mamtainea ine authority or me national trovernmem anu me in . togrtty and perpetuity ot the Union at such a cost of treasure and Hie. as a wise and necessary em bodiment In the organlo law of the just results of the war. Tne people or tne rormer siave-noiuing States accepted these results, ana gave, in every nartioable form, asiurances that the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, and laws passed in pursuance thereof, should In good faith, be enforced, and rigidly and impartially, In letter and spirit, to the end that the humblest citizen, without distinction of race or color.should, under them, receive full and equal protection in person and property ana in poimcal rignt ana privi leges, fiv these constitutional amendments, the southern section of the Union obtained a large Increase or political power in congress and in tne Electoral College, and the country justly expected that elections would orocoel. as to the enfranchis ed race, upon the same circumstances of legal nd constitutional freedom and protection which obtained In all the other States of the Union. The friends of law and order looked forward to the oondnct of the' electlous, as offering to the gen eral ndgment of the country an important onnor tunlty to measure the degree In which the right of suffrage oonld be exercised by the colored peo ple, and would be respected by their fellow oil!- en: bnt a more general enloyment of freedom of suffrage by the colored people, and a more just ana generous protection 01 mat ireeaom py tne communities of which they form a part, were gen erally anticipated than the record of the elections discloses. In some of those States In which the colored people have boen unable to make tbelr opinions ieit in tne elections, tne result is mamiy due to Influences not easily measured or remedied by legal protection; but In the States of Louisiana ana soutn Carolina at largo, and lu some particu lar Congressional districts outside of those States, the records of the elections seem to compel the conclusion that the rights of the colored voters uvh ih-uu overriden, ana tnoir participation m me elections not permittea to oe euner gener al THE DUTY OF CONGRESS. It will be for the Congress for which these elec tions were held, to make such examinations Into their conduot as may be appropriate to determine the validity of the claims of members to their teats. In the meantime it becomes the duty of the Executive and Judicial Departments of the Government, each in Its province, to inquire Into and punish violations of the laws of the United States whloh have occurred. I can but repeat what I said in this connection In my last menage, that whatever authority rests with me to this end I shall not hesitate to pnt forth, and I am nnwlll lug to forego a renewed appeal to the legislatures, the oourts, the executive authorities, and the peo ple of the States where these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give theluasittance toward bring ing to Justice the offender! and preventing are- petition of the crime Mo means within my pow er will be spared to obtain a full and fair In Yosllgatlon of the alleged crimes, and to se cure the conviction and Just punishment of the ollty. It is to be observed that the principal appropria tion made for the Department of Justice at the last session contained the following olause: "And iur ueu.jius uisripeniei wnicn may oe incur red in the enforcement of the act aopruved Feb ruary tweniy-eigoi, eignieen nuudred and seven- to one, entitled 'An act to amend an act approved May tnlrlleth. eighteen handed and BAViantv an. titlpd. An ant tn AnfnnA tha h . ni, i the United Slates to vote In the several States of we union, ana ror otner purposes,' or any acts u Biucuumvi tuuieui ur supplementary mere it is the opinion of the Attorney-General that the expenses of these proceedings will largely ex ceed the amonnt which was thus provided, and I call confidently noon Congress to make adequate appropriations to en able the ExecutlveDeparunent to enforce the laws. I respectfully urge npon your attention that the Congressional elections, In every district, in a very Important sense, are Justly a matter of rolitlcail Interest and concern tnronghout the whole coun try. Each State, every political party, is entitled to tne share of power which it conferred by the legal and constitutions! snfTrnge. It Is the right of every citizen, possessing the qualifications pre scribed by law, to cast one unlutimliliiled ballot, and to have tils ballot honestly counted. So long as the exercise of this power and the enjoyraeut of this right are common and equal, practically aswell as formally, submission to the results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all the departments of the 3uvenuent will feel the true vigor of the populat will thus ex pressed. No temporary or adinlnlstaatlve Inter ests of Government, however urgent or weighty, will ever displace the seal of our people In defence of the primary rights of citizenship. They under stand that the protection of liberty rt quires the maintenance, in fuil vigor, of the manly methods of free speech, free press, and free suffrage, and will sustain the fall authority of Government to enforce the laws which are framed to preserve these inestlmaole rights, The material progress and welfare of (he States depend on the protection afforded to their citizens. There can be no peace without such protection, no prosperity without peace, and the whole country is deeply In terested in the growth and prosperity of all its parts. While the country has not yet reached complete unity of feeling and reclprncaloonlldence between the communities so lately and so seriously es tranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the ten dencies are lu that direction, and with Increasing force. The power of public opinion will override all political prejudices, and all sectional or Hinte attachments, in demanding that all ovor our wide territory the name and character of citizens of the United States shall mean one and the same thing and carry with them unchallenged security and respect. OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. Our relations with other countries continue peaceful, Our neutralify In contests between foreign powers has been maintained aid respect ed. The Universal Exposition held at Paris during the past summer has been attended by large numbers of our citizens. The brlof period allow ed for the preparation and arrangement of the contributions of our citizens to this great Exposi tion was well employed In energetic and judicious efforts to overcome this disadvantage. These ef forts, led and directed by the Commissioner-Gen eral, were remarkably successful, and the exhi bition of the products of American Industry was creditable and gratifying in scope and character, The reports of the United States Commissioners, giving its results in detail, will be duly laid before you. Our participation in this International com petition for the favor and trade of the world may be expected to produce useful and In portaut re sults In promoting Intercourse, friendship and commerce with other nations. In accordance with the provisions ol the act of February 28, 1H78, three commissioners were ap pointed to an Internationa', conference on the sub ject of adopting a common ratio between gold and silver, for the purpose of establishing, internation ally, the use of blmetallo money, and securing fixity of relative value between those metals. Invitations were addressed to the various Gov ernments which had expressed a willingness to Earticipate in its deliberations. The conference eld its meetings in Paris, in August last. The report of the commissioners, herewith submitted, will show its results. No common ratio between gold and silver could be agreed upon by the con ference. The general conclusion was reached that it is necessary to maintain in the world the monetary fur ctlons of silver as well as gold, leav ing the selection of the use of one or the other of these two metals, or of both, to be made by each State. HALIFAX AWARD. Congress having appropriated at Its last session the sum of $5,500 000 to pay the award or the Joint Commission at Halifax, If, after correspondence with the British Government, on the subject of the conformity of the award to the requirements of the treaty, and to the terms of the question there by submitted to the Commission, the President shall deem it his duty to make the payment, com munications upon these points were addressed to the British Government through the legation of the United States at London. Falling to obtain the concurrence of the British Government In the views of this Government respecting the award, I have deemed It my duty to tender the sum nam ed, within the year fixed by the treaty, accompan ied by a notice of the grounds of payments, and a protest against any otner construction or tne same. The correspondence upon the subject will be laid before you. The Spar lsh Government hasofllcially announc ed the termination of the insurrection In Cuba, and the restoration of peace throughout that is land. Confident expectations are expressed of a revival of trade and prosperity which it is earnest ly hoped may prove well founded. Numerous claims of American citizens for relief for injuries or restoration of property have been among the incidents of the long continued hostilities. Some of these claims are In process of adjustment by Spain, and the others are promised early and care ful consideration. The treaty made with Italy, in regard to recipro cal consular privileges, has deen duly ratified and proclaimed. No questions of grave Importance have arisen with any otner of the European powers. The Japanese Government has been desirous of a revision of such parts of Its treaties with foreign powers as relate to oommerce, and, It Is under stood, ba. addressed to each of the treaty powers a request to open negotiations with that view The United States Government has been inclined to regard the matter favorably. Whatever restric tions upon trade with Japau are found Injurious to that people cannot but affect injuriously na tions holding commero'al intercourse with them. Japan, after a long period of seclusion, has within the past few years made rapid strides In the path of enlightenment and progress, and. not unreason ably, Is looking forward to the time when her re lations with the nations of Europe and America shall be assimilated to those which thy hold with each other. A treaty looking to thlsend has been made, which will be submitted foo tbe considera tion of the Senate. After an interval of several years the Chinese Government has again sent envoys to the United States. Thy have been received, and a perma nent legation Is now established here by that Gov eminent. It is not doubted that this step will be of advantage to both nations in promoting friend ly relations and removing causes of difference. The treaty with the Samoau Islands, having been duly ratified and accepted on the part of both Governments, is now in operation, and a survey of the harbor of Pago-Pago have been made by a naval vessel of the United States, with a view of Its occupation as a naval station, if found desira ble to the service. OUR RELATIONS WITH MEXICO. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations with Mexico, correspondence has been Opened and sttil continues between the two Governments upon the various questions which at one time seemed to endanger their relations. While no formal agreement has been reached as to the troubles on tbe border, much has been done to re press and diminish them. The effective force of United States troops on the Rio Grande, by astrict and faithful compliauce with Instructions, has done much to remove ihe sources of dispute, and it is now understood that a like force of Mexican troops on the other side of tbe river is also making an energetic movement against the marauding Indian tribes. This Government looks with the greatest satisfaction upon every evidence of strength In the national authority of Mexico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent or punish In cursions upon our territory. Kelnatant to assume any action or attltade in the control of the incur sions, by military movements across the hnrrinr. not imperatively demanded for tbe protection of ine uvea anu properly 01 onr own citizens, 1 snail take tbe earliest ODnortnnltv. consistent with ih proper discharge of this plain duty, to recognize the ability of the Mexican Government to restrain effectively violations of onr territory. It Is pro posed to hold next year an International Exhibi tion in Mexico, and 11 is believed lhat the display of the agricultural and manufacturing produets of tbe two nations will lend to better understand ing and Increase commercial intercourse between their people. With Brazil, and the Republic of Central and South America, some steps have been taken to ward the development of closer commercial inter course. Diplomatic relations have been resumed with Columbia and with Bolivia. A hnnnrt.n question between the Argentine Republic and Paraguay has been submitted by those Govern ments for arbitration to the President of the Unit ed States, and I have after care'nl examination, given a decision upon it. A naval expedition up the Amazon and Madeira rivers, baa brought back Information valuable both for scientific and commercial purposes. A like expedition la about visiting the coast nr a m ca and tbe Indian ocean. The reports of diplo matic and consular officers In relation to the de velopment of our foreign commerce, have furn ished many facts that have proved of public in terest and have stimulated to practical exertion the enterprise of our people. THE FINANCES. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury fur nishes a detailed statement of the operations of that Department of the Government, and of the condition of Ihe public finances. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the flsca! year ended June 30, 1878, were 1257,76.1,878.70! the ordinary expenditure for the same period. were 823J,964,32.80 leaving a surplus revenue for lbeyearof2J,79,l.M. The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending Juno 30, lu"'.), actual and estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter commencing July 1, IMS, 873,389,743.43 ; estimated receipts for the remaining three quarters of the year, 81 91, 110, irHi 67. total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, 8204,500,000. Tbe expendi tures for the same period will be, actual and esti mated, as follows : For the quarter commencing July 1, 1878, actual expenditures, m 311,578.27; aud for the remaining three quarters of the yean tne expenditures are estimated at nu,7;r,4j 73 making the total expenditures 1210.100,000 and leaving an estimated surplus revenue, lor the year ending June 8t, 1070, of 8 '4,4('0.000. The total rerdnts rinr'i e I in-next fiscal year, ending June :vi msi . -i-t according toex- Istlng laws. v. ii :i.w-..4ii,68; leaving a sur plus of 828 17u I ,, i i, ml ear. In the foregoii'it statements ot expenditures, ac tual and estimated, no amount Is allowed for the sinking fund provided for by the set approved February 25, 1HI12, which requires that oue per cent, of tbe entire debt of the United States shall be purchased or paid within each fiscal year, to be set apart as a Kinking fund. There has been, however, a substantial compliance with the con ditions of the law. By its terms, the publlo debt should have been reduced between 1802 and the close of the last fiscal rear, 8018,361.800 .28 ; the ac tual reduction of the ascertained debt, lu that period, has been 8720,1111.730 61; being lu excess of tbe reduction required by tne sinking luntl act 8202.2S2,933.33. The amount of the publlo debt, less cash In the Treasury, Novembor 1, 1878, was g2,02l,200,0H:i,18- a reduction since tne same date last year, ot .!, 150,617 30. 'ihe progress made during the last year, in re funding the public debt at lower rates of interest, ts very gratnying. ine amount ot tour per cent, bonds sold during the present year prior to No vember '23,1878, Is 8100,270,'JOO, and six per cent, bonds, commonly known as five twenties, to an equal amount, have been, or will be redeemed as calls mature. It has been the policy of the Department to place tne tour per cent. Donas wttniu easy reach of every eltizen who d sires to invest his savings. whether small or great, In these securities, Tbe Secretary of the Treasury recommends that the law be so modified, that small sums may be In vested, and that through the postofltc.es or other agents oi tne (iovernment, tne freest opportunity may be given In all parts of the country for such investments. Thelbest mode suggested Is, that the De partment be authorized to Issue certificates of de posit, of the denomination of ten dollars, bearing interest at the rate of 3.05 per cent, per annum and convertible at any time witbin one year after tneir issue into tne iour per per cent, doiios au thorized by tbe refunding act, and to be Issued only in exchange for United States notes sent to the Treasury by malt or otnerwise. sucn a provision of law, supported by suitable regulations, would enable any person readily, without cost or risk, to convert his money Into an Interest bearing securi ty of the United States, aud tbe money so received could oe applied to tne redemption ol six per cent, bonds. The coinage of gold during the last fiscal year was 152,08,1WU. Tbe coinage of silver dollars, un der the act passed February '28, 1878, amounted ou the 23d of November, 1878, to 81'J,811,5tO. of which amount 81.084 017 are lu circulation, and the bal ance. 814 820,603, Is still the possession of the Gov ernment. With views unchanged with regard to the act under which the coinage of sliver proceeds, it has been the purposo of the Secretary faithfully to ex ecute the law, aud to afford a fair trial to the mea sure. In the present financial condition of the country I am persuaded that the welfare of legitimate bu siness and industry of every description will be best promoted by abstaining from all attempts to make radical changes in the existing financial legislation. Le, it be understood tbat durlr.g the coming year the business of the country will be undisturbed by governmental interference with the laws allecting it, and we may confidently ex pect that tbe resumption of specie payments, which will take place at the appointed time, will be successfully and easily maintained, and that it will be followed by a healthful and enduring revival of business prosperity. It the healing influence of time, the Inherent energies or our people ana the boundless re sources of our country, have a fair opportunity, and relief from present difficulties will surely fol low, THE 

ARMY. The report of the Sncretary of War shows that the army has been well and economically sup plied, that our small force has been actively em ployed, and has faithfully peiformed all the ser vice required of it. The morale of the army has improved; and the number of desertions have materially decreased during the year. The Secretary recommends 1. Tbat a pension be granted to the widow of the lale Lieu t Henry a. Benner, istn inraotry, who lost his life by yellow fever while in com mand of tne steamer "j. m. unamners, sent witn Buppliei for the relief of the sufferers in the South from that disease. 2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for the benefit of the bolrs of deceased officers, as suggested bv the Paymaster General. 3. Theadoptlou by Congress of a plan for the publication of the records oi the war or tne He bullion, now being prepared for that purpose. 4. The increase of tne extra per diem of sol dier-teachers employed In post-schools, and the liberal appropriations for the erection of build ings for schools and libraries at the different p08tS. 6. Tbe repeal oramendmentof the actof June 18, 1878, forbidding the "use of the army as a posse comttatus. or otnerwise, ror tne purpose or execut ing the laws, except in sach cases and under such circumstances by tbe Constitution or by act of uongreas." 6. The passage of a joint resolution of Congress legalizing tne issues ot rations, tents, ana meat clues which were made for the relief of sufferers from vellow fever. 7. thi t provision be made for the erection of a nre-proor ouuding ror tne preservation oi certain valuable records, now constantly exposed to de struction by lire. These recommendations are all commended to your favorable consideration. THE ARMY. THE NAVY. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that the navy has Improved during the last fiscal year. Work has been done on 75 vessels, ten of which have been thoroughly repaired, and made ready for sea. Two others are in rapid progress towards completion. Tbe total expenditures of the year, including the amount appropriated for the deficiencies of the year, were 817,408,892.03. The actual expenses chargeable to the year, ex clusive of these deficiencies, were 113,306,914 09, or 1707,100 18 less than those of the previous year, ana St, 928,077.74 less tnau tne expenses, including the deficiencies. Tbe estimates for tbe fiscal year ending June 80, 1880, are 814 .502 381.45 exceeding tne appropriations 01 me present yearoniy ,,, 049.75; which excess Is occasioned by tbe de mands of the Naval Academy and Marine Corps, as explained In the Secretary's report. TheaD- prnptiattons for the present fiscal year are 514, 528,481.70, which, in opinion of the Secretary, wii be ample lot all the current expenses of the Del partment during the year. The amount drawn from the Treasury from July 1 to Nov. 1. 1878, is j.i.4o,;ih.h, 01 wnicn iu ueti.o nan oeon reiuna ed. leaving as the expenditure ror that period 84. 609,563.40, or 520,899.'24 less than the correspond ing period of the last fiscal year. THE 

POSTAL SERVICE. The report of the Postmaster General embraces a detailed statement of tbe operations of the Post office Department The expenditures of that De partment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were 134 165,084.49. The receipt, Including sales of stamps, money order business,, and official stamps, were 129,277,516 95. The sum of 1290.436.90 Including in the foregoing statement of expendi tures, Is chargeable to preceding yean, so that the actual expenditures for tbe fiscal year ended Jane 30, 1878, are f 18,874,647.60. The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to the revenues of tbe Department, was 15,307 ,65182. The expenditure for tbe fiscal year ending Jane 80, 1880, are estimated at t36.671.9oO, and the receipt from all sources at $30,664,023 90, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated ont of the Treasury of 86,907,876 10. The report call atten tion to the fact that the compensation of postmas ters and of railroads for carrying the mall Is regu lated by law, and that tbe failure of Congress to appropriate the amonnt required for these pur poses does not relieve the Government of respon sibility, but necessarily increase the deficiency bills which Congress will be called npon to pass. In providing for postal service the following questions are presented : Should Congress annu ally appropriate a sum for Its expenses largely In excess of its revenues, or should sach rate of postage be established as will make the Depart ment self-sustaining 7 Should the postal servioe be reduced by excluding from the malls matter which does not pay Its way f Should the number of post routes be diminished T Should other me thods be adopted which will Increase the reve nues or diminish the expense of the postal ser vice 1 Tbe International Postal Congress, which mot at Pari May 1, 1878, and continued In (vision un til Jnne 4 , of the same year, was composed of del egates from nearly all Ihe civilised 00 an tries of the world. It adopted a new eoavtnttoo, lo lake tho plauc of the treaty concluded at Borne, Oct. 0, 1874; which goes Into effect on the first of April 1870, between Ihe countries whoso delegates have signed it. It was ratified and approved, bv aud with the consent of the President, Aug. 13, 1878. A. synopsis of this Universal I'oslal Convention will be found tho report of the Postmaster (ieuer al, and the full text In (he appendix thereto. In It:-origin the Postal Union comprised 23 coun tries, having a population of 3Ti0,0ti0,(00of people. On the 1st of April next It will comprise 43 coun tries and colonies, with a population of more 'ban 650,000,000 of people, and will soon, by the : O es slim of the few remaining countries and colonies which maintain organized postal service, consti tute, lu fact as well as In name, as Its new title in dicates, a Universal Union, regulating, upon a uniform basis of cheap postage rates, the postal Intercourse between all civilized nations. Some embarrassment has arisen out of the con flict between the customs laws of this country aud the provisions of the Poslal Convention, lu regard to the transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this country by mall, It is hoped that Congress will be able to devise some means of reconciling the dilliciiltles which have thus been created, so as to do justice to all parties Involved. THE 

COURTS. Tbe business of the Supreme Court, and of the courts in many of the circuits, has increased to such an extent during the past years that addi tional legislation Is Imperative to relieve and pre vent the delay of justice, and possible oppression to suitors, which is thus occasioned. The encum bered condition of these dockets Is presented anew in the report of tile Attorney (lonernl, and the remedy suggested Is earnestly urged tor Con-gres-ionai action. The creation of additional cir cuit Judges, as proposed, would afford a complete remedy, and would involve an expense at the present rato of salaries ot not more than 800,000 a THE INDIANS. The annual reports of the Secretary of the Inte rior and of the Commissioner of Iudlau Affairs present an elaborate account of the present con dition of the Indian tribes, and of that branch of public service which ministers to their interests. While the conduct of tbe Indians generally has beeu orderly, and their relations with their neighbors friendly and peaceful, two local dis turbances have occurred, which were deplorable In their character, but remained, happily, con fined to a comparatively small number of In dians. The discontent among the Bannocks, which led first to some act of violence on the part of some members of the tribe aud finally to the outbreak, appears to have been caused by an In sufficiency of food on the reservation, and this Insufficiency to have been owing to tbe Inade quacy of the appropriations, mada by Congress, to the wants of the Indians, at a time when the Indiana were prevented from supplying the defi ciency by hunting. After an arduous pursuit by the troops of the United Statec, and several en gagements, the hostile Indians were reduced to subjection, and the larger portol them surrender ed themselves as prisoners, In this connection, I desire to call attention to the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that a suffi cient fund be placed at the disposal of the Exec utive, to be used, with proper accountability, at discretion, In sudden emergencies of the Indian service. The other case of disturbance was that of a band of Northern Cbeyennes who suddenly left their reservation In the Indian Territory and marched rapidly through tbe State of Kansas and Nebraska in the direction of their old hunt lng grounds, committing murders and other crimes on their way. From documents aecompa- nylng the report of the Secretary of the Interior, It appears that this disorderly band was as fully supplied with tbe necessaries of life as the 4,700 other Indians who remained quietly on the reser vation, and tbat the disturbance was caused by men ot a restless and mischievous disposition among the Indians themselves. Almost the whole of this band bave surrendered to the mill taty authorities, and it is a gratifying fact that, when some of them had taken refuge in the camp of tbe Red Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners and readily gave them up to the officers of the United States, thus giving new proof of tbe loyal spirit which, alarming rumors to tne contrary noiwunstamuug, mey nave uni formly shown ever since the wishes they ex pressed at the council of Sept., 1877, had been complied with. Both the Secretary of the Interior and Secreta ry of War unite In the recommendation that pro vision be made by Congress for the organization of a corps of mounted ''Indian auxiliaries," to be under the control of the army, and to b'i used for the purpose of keeping the Indians on their reser vations and preventing or repressing disturbance on their part. I earnestly concur in this recom mendation. It is believed tbat the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the Government, would con siderably weaken tbe restless element among the Indians by withdrawing from It a number of young men and giving them congenial employ ment uuder the Government, It being a matter of experience that Indians in our service almost without exception are faithful In tbe perform ance of the duties assigned to them. Such an or ganization would materially aid the the army in the accomplishment of a task for which its nu merical strength is sometimes found insufficient. But, while the employment of force for the pre vention or repression of Indian troubles is of oc casional necessity, and wise preparation should be made to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humane aud clvilizlngagencies for the ultimate solution of what Is railed the Indian problem. It may be very difficult, and require muob patient effort, to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian to tbe restraints of civilized life, but experience shows that it Ib not impossble. Many of tbe tribes which are now quiet and or derly and self-supporting were once as savage as any that at present roam over the plains or In the mountains of the far West, and were then consid ered iuaccessble to civilizing Influences. It may be Impossible to raise them fully up to tbe level ol the white population of the United Stales, but we should not forget tbat they are the aborigines of the country, and called the soil their own on which our people have grown rich, powerful, and happy. We owe It to them as a moral duty to help them in attaining at least that degree of civ ilization which they may be able to reach. It is cot 'only our duty It is also our Interest to do so. Indians who have become agriculturists or herdsmen, aud feel an interest in property, will thenceforth cease to be a warlike t nd disturbing element. It is also a well authenticated fact that Indians are apt to be peaceable and quiet when their children are at school, and I am gratified to know, from the expressions of Indians them selves and from many concurring reports, tbat there is a steadily Increasing de-ire, even among Indians belonging to comparatively wild tribes, to have their children educated. I Invite atten tion to the reports of tho Secretary of tbe Interior and Commissioner of Indian Affairs, touching the experiment recently inaugurated, in taking flay Indian children, boys and girls, from different tribes, to the Hampton Normal Agricultural In stitute, In Virginia, where they are to receive an elementary English education aud training in agriculture and other useful work to be return ed to their tribes, after the completed course, as interpreters, Instructors, and examples. It is re ported that the officer charged with the selection of those ohildren might have bad thousands of young Indians sent with him had it been possible to make yrovlslon for them. I agree with the Seoretary of tbe Interior in saying tbat the "re sult of this interesting experlmeut, If favoiable, may be destined 10 become an important iacior In the advancement of civilization among the In diana," The question, whether a change In the control of the Indian service should be made, was, at the last session of Congress, referred to a committee for Inquiry and report. Without desiring to an ticipate that report, I venture to express th hope that In the decision of so Important a question, the views exoressed above mav not be lost sight of, and that the decision, whatever It maybe, will arrest farther agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect npon tbe lervloe as well a on tne Indians mem- Mire. HOT 

SPRINGS. In the enrollment of the bill making appropri ation for sundry otvll expenses, at the last ses sion of Congress, that portion which provided for the continuation ot the Hot Spring commission waa omitted. As tbe commission bad completed the work of taking testimony on the many con flicting claim, the suspension of their labor, be fore determining the rights of claimants, threat ened, for a time, to embarrass the Interests, not only of the Government, bnt also of a large num ber of tbe citizens of Hot Springs, wbo were wait ing for final aetlon on their claims before begin ning contemplated improvements. In order to prevent serious difficulties, which were appre hended, and at the solicitation of many leading citizen of Hot Springs, aud others Interested in ihe welfare of the town, the Secretary of the In terior waa authorized to request the late commis sioners to take charge of the record of their pro ceedings, and to perform such work as could properly be done by them under such circum stances, to facilitate the future adjudication of the claim at an eariy day. and to preserve tbe Metoj of toe claimant on ill their right should be finally dete-mlned. The late commissioners compiled with the request, and retort lhat the testimony. In all the cases, has been written nut, examined, briefed, and so ananged as to facili tate uu esrly settlement when authorized by law. It Is recommended that Ihe requisite authority be given at as early a day In the session as possible, and that a fair compensation be allowed the lat ter commissioners for the expenses incurred aud the labor performed by them since the 2Uh of June last. TIMBER ON PUBLIC LANDS. I Invite tbe attention of Congress to the recom mendations made by tbe Secretary of the Interior with regard to tbe preservation of the timber on the public lands of the United StaUs. Tbe pro tection of the public property Is one of the first duties of Ihe Government, Tbe Department of tbe Interior should, therelore. be enabled by suffi cient appropriations, to enforce the laws In tbat respect But this matter appears still more Im portant as a question of publlo economy. Tbe rapid destruction of our forests Is au evil fraught with tbe gravest consequences, especially In tbe mountainous districts, where the rocky slopes, once denuded of their trees, will remain so for ever. There Ihe Injury, once done, cun not be re pa red. I fully concur with the Secretary of the Interior in the opinion that, for this reason, legis lation touching the public timber in the moun tainous Slates and Territories of the West, should be especially well considered, and that existing laws, in which the destruction of the forests is not sufficiently guarded against, should be specially modified. A general law concerning thit import ant subject, appears to me to bo a matter of ur geut public uecetsity. AGRICULURE. From the organization of the Government, the Importance of encouraging, by all possible means the Increase of our agricultural productions bas been acknowledged aud urged upon the atten tion of Congress and the people as the surest and readiest means of Increasing our substantial and enduring prosperity, The words of Wssbington are as applicable to day as when, In bis eighth annual message, he said : "It Is not to be doubted that with reference to either Individual or national welfare, agricul ture Is of primary importance. In proportion as nations advance In population and other circum stances of maturity, this trutb becomes more ap parent, and renders the cultivation of toll more and more an object of public patronsge. Institu tions for promoting it grow up, supported by the public purse-and to wbat object can it be dedi cated with greater propriety ? Among tbe means which bave been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of boards composed of proper char acters, charged with collecting and diffusing in formation, and enabled, by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist the spirit of discovery and Improvement contributing dou bly to the increase of improvement by stimulat ing to enterprise and experiment, atd by draw ing to a common center tbe results everywhere of individual (kill and observation, and spreading them thence over tbe whole nation, Experience accordingly hatb shown that they are very cheap Instruments of immense national benefit.'1 The great preponderance of the agricultural, over any other Interest In tbe United Stales enti tles it to all the consideration claimed for it by Washington. About one-half of the population of the United States is engaged In agriculture. The value of tbe agricultural products of the Uni ted States for the year 1878, is estimated at three thousand millions of dollars. The exports of ag ricultural products for the year 1877. as appears from tbe report of the Bureau of Statistics, were 524,000,0C0. The great extent of our country, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables us to produce within our own borders, and by our own labor, not only the neoessarles, but most ol ihe luxuries that are consumei in civilized coun tries. Yet, notwithstanding our advantages of soil, climate ana intercommunication. 11 appears from the statistical statements in tbe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture, tnat we import an nually from foreign lands many millions of dol lars worth of agricultural products which could be raised in our own country. Numerous questions arise in the practice of ad vanced agriclulture which can only be answered by experiments, often costly and sometimes fruit less, which are beyond the means of private Indi viduals, and are a just and proper charge on the whole nation for the benefit of the nation. It Is a good policy, especially In times of depression and uncertainty In other business pursuits, with a vast area of uncultivated, aud hence unproduc tive territory, wisely opened to homestead settle ment, to encourage, by every proper and legiti mate means, the occupation and tillage of tbe soli. The efforts of the Department of Agricul ture to stimulate old aud Introduce new agricul tural industries, to improve the quality and In crease the quantity of our products, to determine the value of old or established the importance of new methods of culture, are worthy of your care ful and favorable consideration, and asslstand by such appropriations of money and enlargement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by tbe present favorable condition for the growth and rapid development of this Important Interest. The abuse of animals In transit is widely at tracting nubile attention. A national convention of societies specially interested in the subject bas recently met at Baltimore, and the facts develop ed, both In regaid to cruelties to animals and the effect of such cruelties upon tbe public health, would seem to demand the careful consideration of Congress, and the enactment of more efficient laws for the prevention of ihese abuses. 

EDUCATION. The report of the commissioners of the Bureau of Education Bhows very gratifying progress throughout the country, in all the Interests com mitted to the care of this important office. Tbe report Is especially encouraging with respect to the extension of the advantages of the common school system, In sections of the country where the general enjoyment of the privilege of free schools is not yet attained. To education more than to anyothcr agency we aro to look, as the resource for the advancement of the people, in the requisite knowledge and ap nreciation of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, audi desire to repeat the suggestion con In my former message In behalf of the enactment of appropriate measures by Congress for the pur-po-e of supplementing, with national aid, the lo cal systems of education In the several States, CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY. Adequate accommodations for the great library which Is overgrowing tho capacity of tho rooms now occupied at the Capttol, should bo provided without further delay. This Invaluable collec tion of books, manuscripts and Illustrative art,has grown to buch proportions, in connection with the copyright system of the country, as to demand the prompt and careful attention of Congress to save it from injury In Its present crowded and Insuffic ient quarters. As this library is national in It character, and most, from the nature of the case, Increase even more rapidly in tho future than in the nost. it cannot be doubted that the people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its usciuiucss. The appeal of the Regent of the Smithsonian Institution for the means to organize, exhlblt.and make available for tbe public benefit the article new stored away belonging to the National Mu seum, I heartily recommend to yonr favorable consideration. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The attention of Congress 1 again Invited to the condition of the river-fioat of the city of Washing ton. It la a matter of vital Importance to the health of tbe National Capital, both temporary and permanent, that the low land in front of the oity, now subject to tidal overflow, should be re claimed. In their present condition, thee flat obstruct the drainage of the city, and are a dang erous source of malarial poison. The reclamation will Improve the navigation of the river, by re stricting and subsequently deepening it channel, and it Is also of Importance, when considered in connection with the extension of the public ground and the enlargement of the park, west and south of the Washington Monument. The report of the Board of Survey, heretofore ordered by act of Congress, on the Improvement of the harbor of Washington and Georgetown, 1 respectfully com mended for consideration. The report of the Commissioners of the District ot Columbia presents a detailed statement ol the affairs of the DIstrldt. The relative expenditures or tne united mate and the District for local purposes la contrasted, showing that the expenditures by the people of tbe Dlsrlict greatly exceea loose 01 tne uenenu Government. Tbe exhibit is made in connection w th estimates for tbe reaulalt rerair or tne deieo tlve pavements and sewers of the city, which 1 a connection, a plan 1 presented for the perma nent funding of the outstanding lecunue 01 tne District. The benevolent reformatory, and penal inatira Hons of tbe District are all entitled to the favor able attention of Congress.'- The Eefbrm School need additional building and teachers. Appro priations whli h will place all ihese Imtltutlori In a condition to bet on e models pf usefulness aud hem tlcenre. will be ngarded by Ihe couulry a liberality wisely betowed, ine commissioner, wim evident justice, request ttentlon to Ihe discrimination made bv (lonureiai against the District in tbe donation of laud for the support of the public schools, and ask that the same liberality that has been shown lo the Inhab itants 01 mo various states ana territories or the United States may be extended to the District of Columbia The commissioners also invite attention fothe damage Inflicted upon publlo and private Inter esla by the present location of the depot aud and switching tracks of the several railroads en tering ihe city, and ask for legislation looking to tbelr removal. The recommendations and sug gestions contained in the report will, I trust, re ceive the careful consideration of Congress. Sufficient time has, perhaps, notitlapsed since the reorgaiilzuilou 0: the Government of the Dig tr ct, under the recent legitlatlon of Congress, fer the expression of a confident opinion aa to its suc cessful operation, but the practical results already attained are so satisfactorily lhat tbefriends of the new Government may well urge upon Coiigressj the wisdom of its continuance, without essential modification, until, by actual expeilcnoe, lis ad vantages and defects may be mure fully ascer R.
