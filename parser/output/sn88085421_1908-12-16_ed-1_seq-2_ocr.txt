HAY WILL GET THE JOB. It' seeTns that Mr. Kay spent a lot of money advertising himself as a repub lican aspirant for the lieutenant-gover nor's job; and now there are some people who would interpret the pri mary election law, which is one of its haziest passages prohibits candidates froru playing the advertising game, as disqualifying Mr. Hay from holding the office t'o which he was elected. If Hay can't have the job. why. it is reas oned, Mr. Coon, the present incumbent, will hold on. ' Of course, anyone with half an eye can that this is but a skirmish in the big light which is soon to be pulled off for the governor's cha'-r. It is now realized tliat Cosgrove, whom the people named as governor, cannot live to serve his term, even if he lives to be inaugurated. If Cosgrove dies be fore inauguration day, it is generally believed that' the present governor, Al bert E. Mead, who was defeated at the primaries, will continue in the position, unless the legislature should call a social election. Rut if Cosgrove lives to be inaugu rated, and Hay is inaugurated, the Wilbur man will stand an excellent' show of inheriting the governorship before his term expires. Just now, the lieutenant-governorship is a big prize, and if Hay can be disqualified. Coon will hold on That Coon hopes to fall heir to the executive office is undeni ably true. But back of it all remains the cold tvard fact' that the people chose Cos grove for governor. Knowing the probable importance of the position, they chose Hay, for lieutenant-gover nor. If Cosgrove fails to serve out his term, the succession, by all the rules of common decency, belongs to Mr. Hay. And The Evening Statesman ven tures guess that 'in such an event, Mr. Ha.v will get the job. AND 

COXGRTSS LAUGHED. If the reports from Washington are to be believed,, congress did not get ex cited about the president's les majes te message yesterday. The} United Press report' has it that "the senate enjoyed as a huge joke a. part of the mesage". and that Vice-President Fairbanks , somewhat "lessened the merriment jn some degree by rapping for order." The Associated Press, or dinarily mire conservati\*>, declares that' "repeated peals of laughter" greeted the reading of the' message. It is little wonder that congress laugher—it is a healthy sign that con gress should laugh when the president of the Vnft'ed States proposed that newspapers which criticize his action should be muzz ed by placing the pro prietor in jail. The World aptly states Mr. Roose velt's position when it says: "This is the first time a president ever asserted the doctrine of les ma jeste or proposed, in the absence of specific legislation, the criminal pros ecution by the government of citizens •who criticised the conduct of individu als, who may have had dealings with th?. government. eXither the king of Great Britain rrcr the German emperor would venture to arrogate such power to himself. John Adams' attempt to enforce the sedition law destVoved the federalist party in America. Yet, Mr. Roosevelt, in the absence of law, offi cially proposes to use all the powers of the greatest government on earth to cripple the freedom of tlie press on the pretext that the government itself has been libelled—and he is the gov ernment." Rack of all this, however, is the fact that' Mr. Roosevelt retorts with personal abuse and cries of "stop thief," when at the outset all that was wanted was a plain statement of facts. But* as long as congress laughs at such silly outbursts, the country can probably survive such displays of Rooseveltism. 

WHEN THE PREACHER LEAVES THE PULPIT. The Chicago Inter-Orean contains a leader of criticism of the conduct of the Rev. Charles Aked, pastor of the Fifth Avenue Baptist church of New York, who left his pulpit and made- the assertion that "both the great American political parties were so evil that it was impossible to say which was the worst." Discousing-'upon the propriety of a ministers leaving his pulpit for politi cal purposes. The Inter-Ocean contains the following very sarcastic criticism: "A comparison of the president of the Unittd State:*-to a 'tree toad' by a wellknown female agitator was among the other amenities of the oc casion. "Earlier in the day there had been a suffragette riot at a meeting of women who opposed woman's suffrage. "At this meeting the Rev. Dr. Ly man Abbott had read a letter from the President saying in substance that, while personally not opposed to wom an's suffrage, he did not consider the question immediately important. "Dr. Abbott, although a preacher, had some excuse for his appearance in this political controversy. For some years he hffs been only nominally in t'he pulpit; he ,appeared chiefly as a messenger; and his wife was one of the leaders of the original movement against woman's suffrage. "But the utterances of Mr. Aked, who is by present vocation a preacher of the gospel, and whose only status is as such. must move laymen to inquire w.hat was thhe call that brought this gentleman from England to our shores. Was it to preach the gospel or to pro mote political agitations? Did he come to save souls or to make stump spopchos of doubtful credibility on woman's suffrage? The questions an swer themselves. "We do not doubt that Mr. Aked is persona'ly a good man of the most benevolent intentions. And therefore he illustrates well what happens usual ly to the preacher who leaves the pul pit and yields to the suggestions which incessantly beset him to become a po litical cat's paw. "The first thought of the authors of any risky or desperate political scheme is to cloak it with respectable names. And what name more respectable than that of a minister of the gospel? The office to which he is set apart at once gives the impression that he is an honest man who would not counten ance %vrong. "And so with the best intentions the preacher often becomes a promoter of diorder, misinformation, and even falsehood. Read Mr. Aned's words; they point the lesson. "Such is the risk run by the preach er when he leaves the pulpit and for gets that his business is with the souls of men and their he forgets that his mission is not to fight in the political arena or to wrestle in the market place, but to preach the | gospel of Jesus Christ that by its power men may be turned from their sins and led to a better living." Pin-haded policemen and mayors in the northwestern part of the state have resumed the manufacture of anarchists by refusing to allow Emma Goldman to speak in their towns and by throwing into jail at every turn of the road. "Why is it that all of the country newspapers haven't mentioned the fact that "we are glad to se our old friend, the Congressional Record, on our exchange table again"? And Mr. Roosevelt just can't under stand how anybody would dare to say anything back to him. But' probably Mr. Pulitzer enjoys the advertising—just the same as any newspaper would. Uneasy lies the head of the city em ployes these strenuous, economizing days.
