FAIR SAN LEANDRO. "Where the llonie-Seekers Go for Comfort and Quiet. A Prosy Little Town Built Up in the Kidst of Fruit-Orchards -Garden Sass-Some of Its Good Things Talked About. Bill Nye, the humorist, was very much Impressed with San Francisco Bay. One day whiln crossing it he suddenly inter rupted a long dreamy silence by remarking dryly to bis companion, "There's one thing like about this bay; there ain't no flies on it." ■ This little incident- recalled a day or two ago during a visit to San Leandrn, an enchanting little hamlet on the other side of tho bay, where, so it is fabled, the Olym pian gods gathered ambrosial nectar to re fresh their immortal steeds. A newspaper man was strolling up and down Its beau tiful avenues, taking in the sights. Every few rods he noted small gatherings of natives (not N. S. G. W.) lounging lazily around, discussing, perhaps, the President's message, or, more likely, Mr. Blame's cor respondence wit'i Crispi. Much to his sur prise he could not understand a word that was said, except occasionally something that sounded like "lauialt1," and lie mar veled thereat. It was deemed the proper tiling to engage some of these ruddy sous iv conversation. They might impart some valuable ii'eas and assist the man of news in obtaining the right sort of information to write up the town. What appeared the most approachable group was approached. The leader of the conversation, or more properly the autocrat, was standing, and, as the intruder drew near, gave him a some what Indifferent but attentive ear. " This is a nice little town you've got here," remarked the man of write-ups, with a copyrighted smile. " Hell ida boot I" was the prompt and confidfbt reply. "No flies onna dthese town." San Leandro Is certainly a most beautiful spot, and fully merits the pride of her in habitants. People in search of riKSIUABLE I! M: 9 Will travel much further and fare much worse. It is not a place that must be made; it is already made. The pioneer's work is done, and has been well done. It simply re mains for the home-seeker to take posses sion. Additional beautifying, of course, will not be forbidden, but if another flower or shrub were never planted, still the place would be a fit übude fur the most romantic fancy. The plr.ee has It; objections; if it had not, it would hava no place in this troublous world. Bat beside its many virtues the objections fade into comparative Insignifi cance. San Leaudro has a future, That also can be said of other places, no doubt. But San Leandro has something more than a future, which, if pictured now, would read like a fairy tale, or an improbable ro mance. One has only to familiarize himself with San Francisco and surroundings to appre ciate the possibilities of San Leandro. The gieat metropolis is bounding, ahead with gigantic strides. Each successive year her industrial marts ore swelled by thousands and thousands more. While her domains are abundantly ample for the increase, the . rigors of her climate drive a very large per centage to seek shelter under a more con genial sun. The law trade winds that sweep the great peninsula may inspire no fear or dread in the man of business who is min tiling dally in thu activities of commer cial life, but when the bustle is . put aside for the peace and quiet ■of home life, then he desires above all other things to be comfortable. He likes to feel that he can sit down in the summer sunshine, without an overcoat on, or eat his evening meal without th« ac companiment of n roaring fire. Again, thousands of the surging multitude desire cheap houses. Title, they can skirt the outer districts of San Francisco and find ■ plenty of lots FOR $25 A 

FIIOXT FOOT, And they will rind also that it is just as completely in Nature's embrace as the sum mit of Mount Shasta, and almost as un available for any purpose, so far as accessi bility and communication are concerned. And, still again, a Very large proportion of city people desire the quiet ai:d retirement of subui ban life for the sake of their fami lies. A large city is nut a desirable place In which to rear and educate the young. Not only is the social atmosphere bad, but the physical atmosphere is even worst). These are the chief reasons for the popu larity of subuiban homes in the vicinity of San Francisco. The first thing to be con sidered is ease and readiness of communi cation; next, the attractiveness and ad vantages possessed by the locality. Both of these questions satisfactorily answered, the success of the future is assured. l£ those and other much more trying ques tions can be answered mote satisfactorily than by San Leauilro, that place-should step quickly to the front and demand the palm. San Leandro Is located about eight miles south of the center of Oakland, and is reached by the same line of railroad that penetrates that entire district between the Pay and the high ridge of hills to ttie east. It lies on what to the eye is apparently li>w and level ground, but, as a physical fact, is fuity-nve feet above the tides, and a part of the almost imperceptible slope from the bay to the base ot the lulls. The. slightest undulation is hardly discernible in any di rection for miles around, and the vision is almost unobstructed along the avenue) till the view is lost in the distance. The incorporated portion of ths town is about a mile and a half square, and when THE LAST CENSUS Was taken contained a population of 2014. II has, of course, very considerably in creased since then, and besides a goodly portion of the town has settled outside tbs corporate limits. So it will not be enlarg ing upon the trutu to put the entire popula tion at 2500, or possibly 2800. Although the t inn is old it seems to pos sess surprislnely few of the objectionable features of old towns. Its original geog raphers must nave bad an eye far into the future when they laid it out. Its avenues, instead of being narrow, stingy and irregu lar, are broad And even, and do matter where one stands the same impression pre vails. It was not an attempt to make streets aud save laud; it was a very success ful attempt to make a beautiful town with broad and majestic avenues regardless of laud. Too often it is the case In country towns that the streets are neglected—have a gen eral uncomely and untidy appearance—and the first impression the visitor cets is that the inhabitants are sluggards. Ramshackle fences lop and stagger on both sides, side walks are nothing but cowpaths through weeds, sand or mud ; streets left exactly as nature made them—ungraded, irregular, full of ruts and hummocks, and a conslaut men ace to passing vehicle). How different in San Leanlro. Every street and avenue in that delectable little hamlet 1* as smooth and even as a race course. The roadways are all graded and macadamized with as much care and skill as an exajtiug CITT GOVERNMENT Would require. The sidewalks nre from twelve to intern feet in width and equally well graded, Both sides of nearly ail the avenues are lined with stately gum trees or poplars. There is hardly a &nabby fence in the town, and the class of dwellings is a long way above the country average. A great many of the little homes planted there are positively elegant, They are in most cases the residences of San Francisco business men, who found there all that could be desired In a suburban home, and have expended all their energies in making them pleasant and attractive. Many of the extensive fruit-growers of the surrounding country have also built charming homes here and there, all giving to the town the general air of comfort and luxury. It cannot be said that San Leandro is a madly enterprising place. Indeed, the very reverse is more nearly the truth, and the neighboring towns are much given to mak ing uncomplimentary remarks about their fair but indolent sister on that account. After all, such a state of things is not to be wondered at, and is nothing unusual. A suburban town that really has no other pur pose but to provide homes is very rarely a place for business. People don't go there for business, and would rather have the business transacted elsewhere. The fact that the place has pride enough to keep her self looking so neat and trim all the time Is almost enough said in her favor. Society is of the very best. Besides the better class of residents, who have all their Interests there, are a great many thrifty fruit-growers, who have extensive interests In the surrounding country, and about USO families, the heads of which do BUSINESS In San Francisco. This fools up something like 300 families, and a "better quality could not be desired. The school is large and well patronized, having eight teachers ami accommodating between 300 and 400 pupils. The urgent need of greater facilities has already been mot by voting $5000 to build a roomy addition. Three churches also iidorn the town, and their pastor* do not. teach morals to empty benches. Better evi dences of a healthy toue of society could hardly be desire I. It has been said in more or less derision that San Leandro Is a Portuguese colony. The fact Is the great bulk of extensive gar dening uod much of the email fruit industry in and surrounding the place is carried on by Italians and Portuguese who have set tled in the place. They are a thrifty lot, • much more peaceable than the tough native element, aid very largely in keeping up the neat appearance of town, and, as a general thing, are all pro ducers of some kind or other. During the dull seasons they lounge around the town more or less, and as they are about the only purely gtay-at-home|. ilass this accounts for the fact that a stranger may go from end to end in the daytime aud not hear a dozen words in English. The time to see San Leaudro at her best Is in the evening, when all her people are at home and there issume interesting social event on hand. The day may have reminded one of Sunday in a country church-yard, but the scene will have been greatly transformed louz before midnight There are no hygienic objections to San Leandro. A healthier place would be HAItl) TO FIND. Whenever it shall become necessary to drain the town the best opportunities are afforded. The elevation is sufficient to give a good fall, and no engineering difficulties whatever stand in the way. The water supply could not be more perfect and com plete. San Leandro is located at the base of the hills in which Lake Chabnt nestles, and its jure crystal water flows in iron arteries all over the town with a pressure of 300 feet elevation. Fire, hydrants aro set at sate distances and a weil-organizcd hose company gives the town absolute protection against lire. A fire engine, indeed, Would be a hindrance. The pressure is naturally greater than an engine could give, and by simply attaching the hose to the hydrant a force is obtained that puffs out a lire in no time. Generous use of this line water supply accounts, too, lor the large number of beautiful yards and lawns. I The country surrounding San Leandro, and of which she originally formed a part, has been noted since the early days of Cali fornia for Its wonderful truit-producing qualities. There is no better soil. It will grow anything luxuriantly that can be pro duced In tho semi-tropics. It has become actually famous for us garden "truck," the abundance and excellence of which has been for many years the boast of the San Francisco and Oakland markets. Cherries, apricots, pi tines, pears, peaches, almonds, raisins and grapes are rais-d in wonderful abundance, and even inside the town limits are still a great many beautiful orchards. The chief industry all summer long is of course the fruit harvest, triul no one can realize ITS MAGNITUDE Without having witnessed it. Car-load after car-luad leaves the station daily forEaßtern markets. New York, Chicago and New Or leans, and so well established is the reputa tion of San Leandro fruit in those markets that the supply is never equal to the de mand. San Francisco gets but very little of the best products ot this fertile country. The one question of great importance to San Leandro is that of communication. When it is assured equal privileges with Oakland. Alameda and Berkeley the race will be no uncertain one. At present but seven trains connect the town daily with San Francisco. This affords all perhaps that is needed for a certain class, but it does not begin to meet the general wish. When the number has been doubled, from 500 to 800 will take advantage of them instead of 200, and a still greater number will increase the traffic In like proportion. For every addi tional train the value of property increases 10 per cent, and in some cases the mere pros pect of increased traveling conveniences puts new "tiffenina in the prices. A short time ago 11. W. Meek, a wealthy resident of Hay wards, obtained a franchise to build an electric railroad from Brooklyn Station, East Oakland, to Haywards, a distance of sixteen miles, and running ri^ht through San Liandro. At a single bound property in that town went Dp 33% percent. it is believed the road will be running iv less than a year, ami then values will take, another jump, for it will bring Oakland right into the town, and, to a certain extent, overcome the drawbacks of the seven-train limit. The power-house of th's system will be erected on the Warner tract, just north Of the town,. Two fairly good-sized manufacturing es tablishments are already located iv San Leandro, and others are promised when the season is ripe. The Bis: Agricultural Works give employment to 100 men, and the Hopper Agricultural Works employ about forty men. One of the excellent features of San Lean dro industry is the farming of small tracts. Many a family is well supported on the profits of five and ten acre tracts, all turned to fruit and vegetable raising. The town boasts of a fairly good town hall, a weekly paper, two public plazas and two or three hotels. 

PROVING CP TOO HIGH. Vnclo Sam May Drop the City Cemetery Suit. The suit of the United States against the city and county for the condemnation of fifty-four acres of the City Cemetery will be called to-day in the United States Circuit Court, but t.'ie Government will likely ask a continuance. District Attorney Garter thinks there is a movement cv foot to prove the value of the land to a much higher figure than it is worth. He said yesterday lie heard that the city would try to realize $0000 nn acre, which he claims is a price bo exorbitant that it is absurd. Iv view of this movement he may ask a continuance that he may fortify him self with the figures of the ex..ct value of that and contiguous lands;. "There am uo graves on the land to be condemned," he Bald, "and I do Dot see why the cily and county should bo alter double the amount the land is really worth. I be lieve in the payment of a just price. Be sides, it will be of advantage to this com munity to have the land condemned, as it will mean the expenditure of thousands of dollars to built the fortifications to be erected and thousands more periodically to keep them equipped. If they prove up the land too high, the amount at the disposition of the Government will prove inadequate and I will have to move a dismissal of the case." DESPONDENCY AND DEATH. Juliu* Strutz Being Out of Work Com. iiiittei" Suicide. About 1:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon Mrs. Menie!z, the proprietor of a 1 .dging home at 331% Bush 6treot, went into ona of the rooms fur the purpose of cleaning it, but was horrified to find the inmate, Julius Strutz, fully dressed and dead upon the bed. She summoned tho Coroner and the body was taken to the Mnrgue. It was le.irned thai the deceased was 50 year* of age, a native of Germany and had been connected with the liquor tradr. nut for two months had not been employed. It w;vs also learned that a friend, Captain SJar tm by name, who keeps a saloon at the coi nrr of Stockton and O'Farrell streets, had been helping .Strutz financially foi some time. He wna despondent on account of bt-iu^ out of work ami had 011 one or two occa sions told Martiu that he proposed making an end of his existence. In the watcr bucket in tne room was found a pharmacy label Diarked **JJ (jr. sulphate moruhine," with which it is supposed the uutortunate ended his existence. OVER EIGHT MILLIONS. Heary Output of Sugar In California. Bounty l p ii. The entire siu.«r output for California for this year amounts, according to the com piled figures of the Internal K-veoue De partment, to 6,670,138 pounds. Tills is con siderably larger than any previous year's Sroiluct and under the bounty clause ot the [cKinley bill, which proviaos for the pnv ment of two cents n pound, ths producers will realize $161,402 70. This is quue >n item in the way of liqui dating the expenses of a plant. While the above figures show the actual amount of suzar claiified nnd the bounty to be paid, they do not include the syrups and molas ses, which the Government nas allowed to bo kept over until next year to give them time to precipitate their sugar. This will be a vast saving and will increase the fig ures of this year's crop aud the consequent bounty claims. Increaaed Kate of Denth.

SAN KKANCFSCO. JJj^PAY. DECKMBKR 15. ISDI-EIGHT PAGES. SEA AND SHORE. Loss of the K. M. S. Moselle Near Colon. Attempt at Suicide—Fast Steam Service—No tice to Mariners—A Law point for Shipping Men. The loss of the R. M. S. Moselle, near Colon, in the early part of November was reported at the time in The Call, together with the fact th.it every one oil board except the captain was saved. By the steamer San Juan from Panama some ad ditional facts regarding the wreck of this fine steamer have been learned. The Mo selle was on her way from Port Simon to Colon and struck on the rocky coast during a dark and stormy night. All efforts to keep her off the rocks proved futile because the heavy sea lifted the (loomed ship higher and blither on the rocks every minute. When daylight came, Captain Howsell cave ( orders to lower tho boats and saw his pas sengers safely in them. lie then ordered the officers and crew to follow, but he himself refused to leavo the vessel. Tho heavy laden boats reached the wharves at Colon without an accident, and then the crew turned their attention to save the captain if possible. The steamer Avon arrived in Colon durum the day aud pro ceeded to the scone of the wreck. She re mained by the stranded vessel for some time, but as no sigu of the captain could be seen she returned to Colon. The crew kept up a close watch along the shore, and held themselves in readiness to assist Captain Kowsell should he attempt to reach the shore by swimming, as the sea nnsfartoo heavy to attempt to reach the vessel with a boat. .Late in the evening, however. Captain Ki'wsell was leen standing on the rail with a life-preserver around him. He waved his hand to the watchers nn shore and then sprang into the sea. He made little headway toward the shore, how ever, on account of the strong undertow, and at last P. Miller, fifth officer of the ill fated steamer, lastnued a rope to his waist and boldly sprang into the sea. Miller was a fine swimmer and rapidly nude his way towaid the struggling man, and would have reached him, but Captain ltowsell was seen to throw up his hands and disappear be neath the naves. Miller was hauled back to shore more dead than alive. He was badly cut and bruised by Contact with the sharp rock*, and it is thought that Bowsell was fatally injured by being dashed against the uuseeu rocks. AX INSANE PASSENGER. Among the passengers from Eureka yes terday on the steamer Los Angeles was J. C. Holtz of Eureka. No one noticed any thing strange in his actions until trie steam pr had been several hours at sea and was off Fort Bragg, Then without warning he walked to the rail and leaped Into the sea. The cry of "Man overboard 1" was raised and the vessel stopped. A lifeboat was low ered and rowed toward the struggling man, who was a first-class swimmer ami whs using all his skill to koep on the surface of the water. To the credit ot the crew Holtz was picked up within nine minutes from tho time he sprang over the rail. lie was returned to the steamer, and after he had been fur nished with a change of clothing waslocked up in one of the state-rooms and kept there until the vessel reached this city. A search of his clothes brought to light a biuli-book. Showing that he had S3OO to his credit. After being locked up he became very vio lent, and as soon as the steamer reached her dock be was turned over to a police officer and taken to the Home for Inebriates. Holtz is a painter by trade and lias lived in Eureka for a number of years. Outside the heads the weather yesterday was hazy with a northeast wind, sixteen miles an hour. The barometer stood 30.22. NEW AND GRAPHIC. The Hydographic Om'ce in this city has received a new and graphic method of work ing out azimuths and hour angles, by which all use of tallies of logarithms and calcula tion is rendered unnecessary—.1 pencil aud parallel rule being all that is required, tiding the latitude, declination and altitude the azimuth Is promptly found, and by the use of the same functions nn other lines the hour angle. G. \V. Litllebales, the author, who is the assistant in charge of the Division of Chart Construction, has spent much time in the production of this chart, ami vouches for its accuracy within the necessary limits of exactness requiied and possible at sea. It will certainly be appre ciated by the uavieator us a si.uple method. It is unofficially reported that after the first of the year the Pacific Mail Steamship Company will establish a fast steam service between tills port and Panama, touching only at the principal ports en route, dis patching a steamer from San Francisco on the sth, 15th and 25th of each month. On the 15th ii steamer touching at all ports will also b« dispatched. It is expected that the steamer Sunol will bo Ei\en the berth at Washington-street Wharf heretofore occupied by the steamer Donahue. The change will be appreciated by those who patronize th« Stinol, and will result in an increase of business for that steamer. It is also reported that the Donahue will receive a thorough overhauling, and be again Used as a passenger boat. NOTICE TO MARINERS. Robert E. Kerkam, Chief of Division, Weather Bureau Service, has issued the following notice to mariners: The ol»eiver at TatoOßh Island (Cipe Flat ten-) has all facilities fur Mgnailni: and reporting voxels pa9«iuK thai station. ;iu<l can see en tiiely acinus Hie strait iv clear weather.

Shot well, wno is also Manager. H. T. Emery is Secretary aud the liank of California Treasurer. Dispatches from London state that the British bark Itedale, bound from Cardiff to Santa Rosalia, has returned to Cardiff through stress of weather. WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME? Ship-owners and captains are very anx ious regarding the outcome of the effort to make the ship Undaunted liable for waves of the three seamen who died while the ves sel was in Itio Janeiro. Captain (Lewis claims that the contract ended with death, and ho Is willing to pay the amount due up to th it time, as has been the custom at this port In such case. The law relating to the subject is nut very clearly defined, and the Federal courts in Massachusetts and also In North Carolina many years ago decided that the death of the man ended the contract, while a court in Pennsylvania decided that the heirs of the dead seaman are enti tled to receive full pay to the end of the voy age, as if the man had lived to be paid off. As the amount in this case ii quite a large one, the case will have to be decided by the Circuit Court, and clearance papers cannot be issued to Captain Lewis until the decis ion is rendered, in spite of the fact that his ship will be ready for sea on Thursday. The Noonday Ri.ck bell buoy has gone adrift, but will be replaced at the earliest date practicable, when due notice will be published of the fact. In the meantime navigators should be extremely cautious in approaching the vicinity of this rock, which lies hidden, with nothing to indicate its position. Captain Minor, formerly of the ship Olym pla, has been appointed to command the bark Wakofield, vice Captain Howes, who was severely injured by a cable-car a few days ago. MOVEMENTS OF VESSELS. The moves yesterday were the James Drumm to Folsorn street, Star of Aus tria to the seawall, Oakworth to Port Costa, Helen Mar to the Union Iron Works, Coi-quernr to the Oil Works, King Arthur to Vallejo street, Sir! us to Howard No. 1, Lucknnw to Oakland and the Glengarry from Port Costa to the stream. To-day the Knight of St. Michaels will come down from Port Costa, the Tropic Bird will no to Mission Xo. 1, the Bat tint Accania into the stream, the Dunnerdale to the Union Iron Works, the Star of Russia and Blue Jacket to Port Costa and the Commodore, Mercury and Tain o' Shanter tow to sea. Arrivals were confined to the steamers Rival and Noyo from . Fort Bragg and the Los-Angeles from Eureka. Departures were the whaling-bark Triton for a cruise, and the schooner Nettie Suud borg for Eureka. CHARTERS ItEPOKTED. Among the latest reported charters are the following: Government iron ship Adelaide, 1281 tons, will load redwood lumber for Liverpool. British ship l>nlarig, 1681 tons, lumber from tiiis port to Callao—chartered by J. W. Grace & Co. The British ship Ii -nlarig has accepted a charter to load lumber from this port to Callao. She arrived here from Dunkirk, France, under charter to l>ad wheat back at 455, but the charterer could not keep his engagement, hence the change. A ltnd-Huircl Chinaman. 1A little amusement was created in Judge Worley's court yesterday by a strange coin biuatlou seeu to tUo prliouet'sdoek. A fiery red head, the deformity of a hunchback find j the alnioii't-eyed face of a native : of trie celestial Kingdom. The eninp >Mt« entity re sp' utled to the name of (Sow Yung. • anil: .Km ill' on the charge of selling lottery tick -1 ts. Hii strange appttar&UCe was aecoubt»d . for !>y Ills deformity (if lieinc hunchbacked, which excited so much ridicule that the un fortunate Mongolian had attempted tn ob literase his natur il appearance as much us posMnle, and had eschewed the Chinese drew, curled up his queue and put on a red wig. v A FARCE-COMEDY. Graphic Description of a Gunto inalan Election. " The election of General Eeyna Barrios to the Presidency of Guatemala spems as sured," said Major A. 11. Nave, who has re cently thrown uu a commission as Army Instructor, wi:icli he held from President Barilla*. "Barillas favors his candidature for self ish reasons. During the two years of his Dictatorship und the live years of his Presi dency, Barillas has confiscated property worth gI(),O'.K).O(X>, and appropriated the I plunder to himself. A portion of tlie spoils is in five large coffee plantations aud the balance is in cash. " When the election is over next month. Baril!:i9 will make an extended tour abroad, feaiing personal consequences should hs re main at home. His solo desire now is to see a man elected as his successor who will pro tect his. interests and save, his ill-gotten gains from reconfiseation. Barrios is op posed to the present system of official rob- Dery in Guatemala, and will hold every man's propel ty Inviolate, aud so Barillas in dorses him. "The election will bo a farce-comedy. The only votes ca--t will be by the soldiers, who will be largely Inlluenenced by their officers, with whom they are 00 the most intimate terms. Few of the civilians pay any atten tion to the contest, but the alcalde of each district will gravely prepare a bogus le port, giving the number of votes which he is pleased to declare have been cast for the enndidatp he favors. "liarilhis has the revision of this list, and will doubtless remedy any defects in the election returns, even supplying nnssinc votes, should they be necessary for an elec tion. The choice of a President by topular vote in Guatemala is rather a hollow honor." 

MINISTERIAL UNIONS. Kirn, 11 Ira I. ICanltin ou Individual Responsibility. Tho Congregational ministers yesterday a'ternoon listened to a lay sermon by Deacon Ira P. liaukin ol tho First Congre gational Church on tho subject of "The In dividual Responsibilities of Church Mem bers," in which he held that greater cau tion should be exercised in the admission of members to the congregation*, and when once iv they should bo impressed with the fact that they were individual workers in the iuterests of the church. The President reported that tlie commit tee which was appointed to confer with similar committees from other ministerial bodies in regard to a mass-meeting on be half of the sufferers frMn the recent earth quake, in Japan had been unaMe to secure the protiosed conference, lie said it was probable the idea of the proposed luass uieeting nnuld be abandoned. A communication was received from the Chicago Congregational Clul) asking that the San Francisco soctety join it iv a me morial to Congress on behalf of the Euro pean convention for the repression of slav ery in Africa, the United States nnd France being tho only nations which havo refused to join the convention. Their refusal is based on the ground that th ■ leading coun tries «f Kurope desire to parcel out Africa among themselves. The communication was referred to the officers of the society with power to act. At a meeting of the Methodist ministers, the President, Upv. G. W. lieaUy, read n paper on the subject of psychology, in which he considered the question of the relation of hypnotism to the operation of the Holy Spirit, and held that all who possessed such influence should use it iv tho interests of religion. The contents of tbe paper were discussed by Key. Messr*. Slmonds, Buck, Hammond. Wylhe and liovanl. U«v. James Woodworth of (he Young People's Societies of Chriati.m Endeavor addressed the meeting, and aske t that the Epworth leagues be Induced to co-operate with his union so far ax to send delegates to the meetings of thn Executive Committee ami j to the quarterly conventions of 'he soci eties.

KECKLE.SS DRIVING. Justice Cook Champions the redestri »llh' Uißllts. On the sth of November a coal-dealer named Giovanni drove atom; East street, near the Clay-street Wharf, but handled his horses so negligently that they knocked down a ship-builder named John Krlckson. The latter was badly hurt and brought suit In the Justices' Couit to recover $299 damages and costs. He claimed that !>y rea son of his injuries he was unable to work and that his wages amounts! to $30 per week when be w;is employed.

Lately there were received two car-loads of peach trees at Auburn, Placer County, from Kansas.

Speaking of the Supreme Court decision be Mid: "I notice th;it some nf the authorities quoted by the Supreme Court were written by Justice Khodea and myself, but evidently the Supreme Court h;is not Interpreted them as wo understood tliPin, but that of course inui.r- no uilTerence now. "in this whole matter I have not been animated by any partisan spirit or motive. Isimpiy wished to carry out the law as I thought it to be and »till think. I have bean subjected t> attack for what I have done, but I presume that was to have beeu ex pected. "I have no hesitancy in telling you that i certainly shall uot ask for a rehearing. Ihii m itter lias b"Pn heard so much in nne form and another that a rehearing would not, in all likelihood, alter the conclusion that I believe the Supreme Court has hon estly reached. If it wen 1 a private matter of my own 1 should probably ask for a rehear ing." The Grand Jury—those men who composed the invalid body—will meet at 3 o'clock this afternoon, fcum a brief report for presenta tion to Judge Wallace and disband as soon as possible thereafter.

Mrs. Marie Guichiirneaud, a lodging house keeper at 513 Howard street, entered Warrant Clerk l'aucliosi's office yesterday with her eye full of ire and her mouth full of lamentation;, due to the treatment she claimed to have received at the hands of one ol her lodgers, a Mrs. Britton. She said that the lodger mentioned is delinquent in her room-rent, and on being requested to vacate, smashed her in the face, threw a bucket of slops over her, threatened to throw her over the banisters, and otherwise maltreated her. Such Are Juries. Lizzie Leontine was tried before Judge Slack yesterday forgrand larceny, being ac cijsej of stealiuK SSO from t'aioliue Franks, but tlie jury dUaureed aud was discharged. It was tliuus;lit there was no evidence to con vicl, still the jury surprised everybudy by voting ten Inr cuiivictiim. pure alcohol to make Wolff's Acmb Bi^ackino. Alcohol is good for leather; it is good for the skin. Alcohol is the chief ingredient of Cologne, Florida Water, and Bay Rum tho well known face washes. We think there is nothing too costly to uss in a good leather preservative. Acme Blacking retails at 20c. and at that price Bells readily. Many people are so accustomed to buying a dress ing or blacking at sc. and 10c. a bottlo that they cannot understand that a black ing can be cheap at 20c. We want to meet them with cheapness if we can, and to ac complish this we offer a reward of for a recipe ■which will enable us to make Wolff's Acme Blackino at such a price that a retailer can profitably sell it at 10c. a bottle. We hold this offer open until Jan. Ist, 1803.
