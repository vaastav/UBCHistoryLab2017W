Second and third, new routes will be proposed for the consideration of Congress?namely, by an extension of the James River and Kanawha canal to the Ohio, and by extension of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal. I am not pre pared to recommend Government aid to these or other enterprises until it is clearly vjiown that they are not only of national in terest, hut that when completed they will be of a value commensurate with their cost, j That production increases more rapidly than the means of transportation in our country hfis tveen demonstrated by past experience, j That the unprecedented growth in popular Hon and product"} of the wholb Country will mjuire additional facilities and cheaper ones for the more bulky articles of commerce to reach tide-water aiid a market will be de iKinded in the near future is equally demonstrable. I would therefore suggest cither a committee or commission, to l>e authorized to consider this whole question and to report to Congress at some future day ?or its letter guidance in legislating on this important subject. The railroads of the country liave been rapidly extended during ?he last few years to meet the growing de mand of producer^; and reflect much credit; upon the managers engaged in their construc tion. In addition to these, a project to facili tate commerce by the building a ship-canal jjround Niagara Falls on the United States .idr. which been agitated for many years, will no doubt be called to your attention at t!ii- session. Looking to the great future growth of the country and the increasing demands of commerce, it might be well, while on this -ubject, not only to have examined and reported upon the various practicable routes lor connecting the Mississippi with tide-water on the Atlantic, but the feasibility of an almost continuous land-locked naviga tion from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico. Such a route along our coast would be of great value at nil times, and of inestimable value, in ca-e of n foreign war. Nature has pro vided the grades for part of this route, and the ol?>tacles to be overcome are easily within ?!x -kii! of the engineer. I have not alluded thi- subject with the view of having any further expenditure of public money at this titnc than may be necessary to procure and place all the necessary information before Congress in an authentic form to enable it hereafter, if deemed practicable and worthy, to legislate on the subject without delay. NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of the Navy, herewith aecompnnying, explains fully the condition of that branch of the public ser * i'v, its wants and deficiencies, expense* in < rn d during tlic i?ist year, and appropria tions for tia -aiiic. It also gives a complete history ot the service of the navy for the |u-t year in addition to regular service. It is evident that, unless early steps are taken to improve our navy, in a very few wars th? United States will be the weak ?-t nation upon the ocean of Hllgn-.it Powers. V. ith an energetic, progressive, business peo ple like ours, penetrating and forming busi ness relations with every part ot the known world, a navy strong enough to command the respect of our dag abroad is necessary for the full protection ot their rights.

The report of the Secretary of tbe Treasury will ?ibow an alarming falling off in our carrying trade for the last ten or twelve years, and ?ten for tbe post year. I do not believe that public treasure can be better expended in tbe interest of the whole people than in tiding to recover this trade. An expenditure of $5,000,000 per annum fbr the nextfivejvear*, if it would restore to us our proportion of tbe carrying trade of tbe world, would be profitably expended. Tbe price of labor in Europe bas so much enhanced within the last few years that the cost of building and, operating oefcari steamers in tbe United States is not so mufch gr&tfer th*' in Eiihopej ahd I believe tbe time hasarfiK - for Congress to take this subject into serious consideration. 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. Detailed statements of the disbursements through the Department of Justice will be furnished by the report of tbe Attorney I General; and though these have been some what increased by the recent acts of Con gress to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of the Fnio.ni and to enforce the provisions of the fburceCutH ariloHditieHt t&.iiie bbnStttu tion of tbe United States and the amenti: racnts thereto, I cannot question the neces sity and salutary effect of those enactments. Reckless and lawless men, I regret to sayi have associated themselves together in some localities to deprive other citizens of those rights guaranteed to tbem by tbe Constitu tion of the United States, and to that end have committed deeds of blood and violence; but the prosecution and punishment of many of these persons have tended greatly to the repression of such disorders. 1 do not doubt that a great majority of the people in all parts of the country favor the full enjoyment by all classes of persons of those rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution and laws, and I invoke the aid and influence of all good citizeus to prevent organizations whose objects are, by unlawful meaus, to in terfere with those rights. I look with con fidence to the time, not far distant, when the obvious advantages of good order and peace will induce an abandonment of all combina tions prohibited by tbe aets referred to, and when it will be unnecessary to carry on pro secutions or iufij^.j)unisbmcnt to protect citizeus from the'SSyless doings of such com binations. Applications have been made to me to pardon persona convicted of a viola tion of said acts upon the ground that clem ency in such cases would tend to tranquillize the" public mind; and to test the virtue of that policy I am disposed, as far as my sense of justice will permit, to'give those iipplica tions a favorable consideration, but any action thereou is not to be construed as in dicating any change in my determination to enforce with rigor such aets so long as the conspiracies and combinations therein named disturb the peace of the country. It is much to be regretted, and is regretted by no one more than myself, that a necessity has ever existed to exccute the enforcement art. No one can desire more than I that the necessity of applying it may never again be de manded. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. The Secretary of the Interior reports satis factory improvement and progress iu each of the several bureaus under the control of the Interior Bopartment. They are all in ex celfent condition. The work which in some of them tor some years has been iu arrears has been brought down to a recent date, and in all, the current business bas been prompt ly dispatched* INDIANS. The policy which was adopted at the be ginning of this Administration with regard to the management of the Indians has been as successful as its most ardent friends anti cipated, and it has within so short a time re duced the expense of their management, de creased their forays upon the white settler*, tended to give the largest opportunity for the extension of the great railways through the public domain and the pushing of settle ment.h into more remote district? of country, and at the same time improved the condition of the Indians* The policy will be main tained without any change excepting such as further experience ttiav show to be neces sary to render it ttiore etiicient. The subject of converting the so-called Indian territory south of Kansas into a home for the Indians, and erecting therein a territorial form of government, is one of great importance as a complement of the existing Indian policy. The question of removal to that territory has within the past year been presented to many of the tribes resident upon other and less desirable portions of the public domain, and has generally been received by them with favor. As a preliminary step to the organization of such a Territory, it will be necessary to confine the Indians now resident therein to farms of proper size, which should : be secured to them in fee; the residue to be used for the settlement of other friendly In dians. Efforts will be made In the imme diate future to Induce the removal of as many peaceably-disposed Indians to the Indian Territory as am be settled properly without disturbing the harmony of those already there* Thcro is no Other loca tion now available where a people who are endeavoring to acquire a knowledge of pass torlal and agricultural pursuits can be as well accommodated as upon the unoccupied lands in the Indian Territory;, A territorial go vernment should, however, protect the In dians from the inroads of whites for a term of years, until thev become sufficiently advanced in tin- art? of civilization to guard their own rights, and from the disposal of the lands held by them for tbe same period. 

LANDS. During the last fiscal ycir there were dis posed of out of the public lands 11,864,075 acres, a quantity greater by 1,01)9,270 acres than was disposed of the previous year. Of this amount 1,370,320 acres were sold for cash, 389,460 acres located with military warrants, 4,671,332 acres taken for home? steads, 603,613 acres located with college scrip, 3,554,887 acres granted to railroaas, 465,347 acres granted to wagon roads, 714,755 acres given to States as swamplands, 560 acres located by Indian scrip. The cash re ceipts from all sources in the Land Office amounted to $3,218,100. During the same period 22,016,608 acres of the public lands were surveyed; which, added the quantity before surveyed, amounts to 583,364,780 acres, leaving 1,257,033,628 acres of the public lands sstill unsurveyed. The reports from" tbe subordinates of the Land Office contain interesting information in regard to their respective districts. They j uniformly mention the fruitfulness of the soil during the past season and the increased yield of ail kinds of produce. Even in those State* and Territories where mining is tbe principal business agricultural products have exceeded the local demand, and liberal ship ment* have been made to distant points. PATENTS. Duriug tbe year ending September 30, 1872, there were issued from the Patent Office 13,626 patents, 233 extensions, and 556 certificates and registries of trade-marks. During the same time 1ft,587 applications for patents, including reissues and designs, have been received, and 3,100 caveats filed. The fees received during the same period amounted to $700,954.80, and the total ex penditures to $623,553.90, making the net receipts over the. expenditures ?77,400.96. Since 1836 200,000 applications for patents have been filed and about 133,000 patents issued. The office is being conducted under tbe same laws and general organization as were adopted at its original inauguration, when only from 100 to 500 applications were made per annum. The Commissioner shows that the office hasoutgTown the original plan, and that a new organization has become neces sary. This subject was presented to Con gress in a special communication in, Febru arv last with my approval and the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and the sug gestions contained in said communication were embraced in tbe bill that was rejwrted to the House by the Committee on Patents at the last session. The subject of the reorgani zation of the Patent Office as contemplated by the bill referred to is one of such import ance to the industrial interests of the country that I commend it to the attention or Con grew?. Tbe Commissioner also treats the subject is W1I bcreiofore refold to? W foe. wjs*t#?ora pQle^JgS for tbc working force and necessary dUw of, the offiw. It U impossible to transact the busi ness of the office, property, without more that must bo comultsd hourly iri tbe trails action of business. The whole Patent Office building will soon be needed, if it is not al ready, tor the accommodation of the business of the Patent Office. MareioHSt The amount paid for pensions in the last fiscal year was $301,093.40?an amount larger by $87,084.84 than wan paid during the preceding yean Of this amount ?231, 849 were paid under the act of Congress of February 17> 1871* to survivors of the war of 1812: ; The annual increase of fjensions by the legislation of Congress has more than "kept pace with the national yearly losses from the rolls. The act of Congress of June 8,1872, has added an estimated amount of $750,000 per annum to the roils without increasing the uumber of pensioners. Wecannot, there fore, look for any substantial decrease in the expenditures of this department for some time to come, or so long as Congress con tinues to so change the rates of pension. The whole number of soldiers enlisted in the W^r of thfc;rebellion was2;p88^23: The to tal number of claims for invalid pensioners is 170,000. being but six per cent, of the whole number of enlisted men,. The total num: ber of claims on band at the beginning, of the year was 91,689. The number received during the year was 28,574. The number disposed of was 39,178, making a net ^ain of 12,004. The number of claims now on file is 79,085. On the 30th of June, 1872, there were on the rolls the names of 95,405 inva lid military pensioners, 113.518 widows, orphans, and dependent relatives, mak ing an aggregate of 208,923 army pen sioners. At the same time there were on the rolls the names of 1,449 navy pen sioners, and 1,730 widows, orphans, and dependent relatives, making the whole number of naval pensioners 3,179. There have been received since the passage of the act to provide pensions for the survivors of the war of 1812,30,551 applications prior to June 30, 1872, Of the^e there were allowed during the last fiscal year 20,126 claims; 4,845 were rejected during the year, leaving 11,580 claims pending at that date. The number of pensions of all classes granted during the last fiscal year was33,838 ; during that period there were dropped from the rolls lor various causes 9,104 names, leaving a grand total of 322,229 pensioners on the rolls on the 30th of June, 1872. It is thought that the claims for pensions on account of the war of 1812 will all be disposed of by the l?t of May,' 1873. It is estimated that $30,480,000 will be required for the pension service during the next fiscal yc:ir. . . THE CENSUS. The ninth census is about completed. Its early completion is a subject of congratu lation "inasmuch as the use to be made of the statistics therein contained depends greatly on the promptitude of publication. The Secretary of the Interior recommends that a census be taken in 1875, which recom mendation should receive the early attention of Congress. The interval at present estab lished between the Fedoral census is so long that the Information obtained nt the decen nial period as to the mateiial condition, wants, and resources of the nation is of lit tle practical value after the expiration of the first half of that period. It would probably obviate the constitutional provisions regard ing the decennial census taken in 1875 should it be divested of all political character, and no reapportionment or Congressional repre sentation be made under it. Such a census; coming as it would in the last year of the first ceutury of our national existence, would furnish a noble monument of the progress of the United States during that century. 

EDUCATION. The rnpidlyincreasing interest in educa inrr !?, m1?0*6 e?wuraging feature in the * f i\ \ history or the country, and it is no doubt true that this is due, in a great mea* ture, to the efforts of the Bureau of Educa tion. lhat office is continually receiving evidences which abundantly prove its eft? ciency from the various institutions of learn ing and education of ail kinds throughout the country. The report of the Commis sioner contains a vast amount of educational details of local interest. The hill now pend ing before Congress providing for the ap propriation of the net proceeds of the sales j of public lands for educational purposes to aid the Oates in the general education of their rising generation is a measure of such great importance to our rcxil progress, and is so unanimously approved by the leading friends of education, that I recommend it to | to the favorable atteution of Congress. territories. Afthir* in the Territories are generally satisfactory. The energy and business ca pacity of the pioneers Who are settling up the vast domains not yet incorporated into btates arc keeping pace in internal improve ments and civil government with the older communities. In but one of them (I'tah) is the condition of affairs Unsatisfactory except tl,e ^uiet of lhe citizeu mav be dis^ turned by real or imaginary danger of Indian hostilities; It has seemed to be the policv of the Legislature of Utah to evade all response bilit.y to the Government of the United States, and even to hold a position iu hos tility to it; ?' I recommended a tiareful revision of the present laws of the territory by Congress and the enactment of such a law as the one proposed in Congress at its last session, for lustance, or something similar to it, as will secure peace, the equality of all citizens bo loie the law, and the ultimate extinguish j ment of polygamy, Since the establishment ot a territorial government tor the District' , ot Columbia, the improvement of the condi tion of the city of Washington and sur roundings, the increased prosperity of the S ?T lL ob3ervable to the most casual \isitor. i he nation, being a lar^e on-nrr nf property 1? this city', sboSld Zfr S the citizeus of the District a just portion of the expens^e of these improvements.

AGRICULTURE. The report of the Commissioner of Agri culture gives a very full and interesting ac count of the several divisions of that Depart ment?the horticultural, agricultural, statis tical, entomological, and chcmical-und the benefits conferred by each upon the agricul tural interests of the country. The whole report is a complete history in detail of the workings of that Department in all its branches, showing the manner in which the farmer, merchant, aud miner is informed and the extent to which he is aidod in his pur suit. The ^Commissioner makes one recom mendation, that measures be taken by Con gress to protect and induce the plauting of | forests, and suggests that no part of the pub- i lie lands should be disposed of without the condition that one-tenth of it be reserved iu timber where it exists, and where it does1 not exist inducements should be offered for planting it. CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION. In accordance with the terms of the aetof Congress approved March, 1871, providing for the celebration of the one hundredth an niversary of American independence, a commission has been organized, consisting of two members from each of the States aud territories. This commission has held two sessions, and has made satisfactory progress in the organization and in the initiatory steps necessary for carrying out the proyisions ot the act and for execuiing,also, the provisions of the act of June 1st, 1872, creating a cen teunial board of flnance. A preliminary report of progress has been received from the president of the commis sion and is herewith transmitted. It will be the doty of the commission at your coming session to transmit n full report of the progress made, and to lav before you the details relating to the exhibition of Ameri can and foreign arts, products, and, manu factures, which, by the term# of the act, is to be held under the auspices of the Govern* teSfflBte in tbe city of dffeeos wttfe graft ititereft asm^kinga cen tury of greater progress and prosperity than to recorded iu tbe htetery of toy other na tion, and as serving" a further good purpose in bringing together on our soil peoples of all the, commercial nations of the earth In a manner calculated to secure international good-feeling. cmi, service. An earnest desire has been felt to correct abuses which hove grown up in the civil service of tlie country through tbe defective method of making appointments to office. Heretofore Federal offices have been regard ed too much as the reward of political serv ice. Under authority of Congress rules have been established to regulate tbe tenure of office and the mode of appointments It cannot be expected tbat any system of rules can "bfe entirety effective, and prove a perfect remedy fflr the existing evils, Until ' they bavo been thoroughly tested by actual practice and amended according to the re quirements of the service. During my terifi of office it shall be my earnest endeavor to so apply the rules as to secure the greatest possible reform in the civil service of the Government, but it Trill require the direct action of Congrej-s to render the enforce ment of the system binding upon my suc cessors; and I hope that the experience of the past year, together with appropriate le gislation by Congress, may reach a patisfac tory solution df this fyuestioii and secure to the public service for dll time a practical me thod of obtaining faithftfl and Efficient offi cers and employ^. . U. S. Qr^nt. Executive Mansion^December 2, 1872; Beportof the Secretary of the Treasury fBY 

TEXEGUAPH TO THE DISPATCH.] Washington, December 2.?The Treasury report says that the necessity exists for a new issue of uational bank notes. Tbe Sec retary exonerates Assistant Treasurer Hill bouse from neglect of duty in the stamp division of the Assistant Treasury at New York. The Secretary again recommends the passage of a bill to amend and consolidate the navigation and customs collcction iaws of the United States. He says as the leading pursuits of the country are now stronger than ever before in the possesion of adequate capital and a supply of intelligent laborers there may be a moderate reduction from time to time in the rate of duties, as the diminishing expenses of the Government shall permit, without either alarming capital or injuring labor. He says the circulation of the banks should be fixed and limited, and tbat power to change the volume of paper in circulation within limits established by law should remain in the Treasury De partment. A degree of flexibility in tbe volume of currency is essential for two reasons. First, the business of the Depart ment cannot be transacted properly if a limit is fixed and the power to raise the cir culation above or reduce it below tbat limit is deuied. Secondly, there is a necessity every autumn for moving the crops without delay from the Southwest to the seaboard, that they may be on hand for export and consumption as wanted. The problem is to find a way of increasing the currency for moving the crops, and diminishing it at once when that work is done. This is a necessa ry work, and inasmuch as it cannot be con tided to the banks the power should be re posed in the Treasury Department Believing that the country is not prepared to sustain the policy of contraction, the Secretary considers the means by which the value of our currency may be" improved. The basis of a policy of improvement must be found in a sturdy refusal to add to the paper circulation until it is of the same value essentially as coin. This being accepted as the settled purpose of the country, there cau be no permanent increase of the difference between paper and coin, and an opportunity will be given for the intluence of natural causes tending upon the whole to a better financial condition. All legislation limited in its operation to the paper issues of the banks and of the Govern ment, whether bearing interest or not. and which in its effect shall tend to diminisn the market value of coin, will be foilnd upon analysis to contain a plan for contracting the volume of paper currency; and all legis lation so limited which does not contain such a plan will prove ineffectual. The Secretary* without proceeding to tbe discus sion of* the general subject of resuming specie payment, thinks all will hive been gained that is of value when the Treasury shall be prepared to pay the demand notes of the Government in coin and the banks shall be prepared to pay their notes either in coin or legal-tender notes, and then our good future wiH clearly appear in this, tbat our paper currency is not exclusively of national bank notes nor exclusively of United States notes.

LATEST FOREIGN NEWS. The Crisis in France. VERSAILLES IN UPROAR AGAIN*. Paris, December 1?In the National As sembly yesterday afternoon, before the min utes of the previous sitting were approved, 31. Baragnon, a Conservative deputy, pro tested against the vote of Friday on the re solution of Minister Dufourc bein^r recorded, because several of the deputies were absent, and he did not believe the result was a fair expression of the will of the Assembly. M. Batbie said he considered that the vote eloquently demonstrated on which side a conservative policy could be found. This remark gave rise to great excitement in the chamber. Many members protested agaiust the language of M. Batbie. and recrimina tions passed backward and forward between the oppo>ing parties. A deputy from Paris questioned the Gov ernment in relation to the encouraging ad dresses which had been sent to Thiers by municipal councils during the present con troversy. He accused the Government of eonniving at and inviting them. M. Le Franc, Minister of the Interior, warmly defended the action of the Govern ment in receiving the addresses, and an nounced that he accepted for himself the principal of ministerial responsibility. The agitation in the Assembly at this point bccame very great. M. Duval made a violent attack upon the Government. 4< Hence forth/' he said, neither Orleanists, Bona partists, or Legitimists will exist, but pir ties will unite lo arrest the fatal descent of the country." lie continued at length iu a violent strain, and concluded by moving a resolution declaring that the municipal coun cils had violated the laws of the country, and that M. Le Franc, in receiving the addresses for the President, had also failed to observe them. Amid much excitement the Assem bly proceeded to vote on the motion, and it was approved by 305 yeas against 299 nays. The result caused a great sensation in the chamber, and the sitting was immediately brought Lo a close. Throughout the entire debate party feeling was inflamed to its high est pitch. The gloomiest impressions pre vail this evening in Paris. It is believed that it will be impossible for President Thiers to govern the country under present circum stances. The monarchists declare that they 1 will oppose Thiers to the bitter end unless he i disavows all responsibility tor the course of Gambetta. [8V TELEORAPn TO THE
