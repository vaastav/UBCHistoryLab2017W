JL • • • Government By ELIHU HOOT. Secretary of State CUE first fruits of democracy are, many of them, crude and unlovely. Mistakes are many, partial failures are many and sins not a few. The capacity for self government does not come to man BY NATURE. It is an art to be learned, as well as an expression of character to be devel oped among the great numbers of men who exercise popular sover eignty. To reach that goal toward which we are pressing forward, the gov erning of the multitude, we must first acquire the knowledge that comes from UNIVERSAL EDUCATION, the wisdom which fol- lows practical experience, that personal independence and self respect befitting men who acknowledge no superior, self control to replace that external control which democracy rejects, RESPECT OF THE LAW, obedience to the lawful expressions of the public will, consider ation of the opinions and interests of others equally entitled to a voice in the state, a loyalty to the abstract conceptions of one's country as inspiring as that loyalty to personal sovereigns which has so illumined the pages of history, the SUBORDINATION OF PERSONAL IN TERESTS TO THE PUBLIC GOOD and love of justice, mercy, liberty and order. All these we must seek by slow and patient effort. iNo student of our times can fail to see that not America alone, but the whole world, is swinging away from the old governmental moorings End intrusting the fate of civilization to the capacity of the POPU LAR MASS to govern. Nor can we fail to see that the world is making substantial progress toward more perfect popular self government. I believe it to be true, viewed against the background of conditions a century, a generation, even a decade ago, that the government of my own country has ad vanced in the intelligent participation of the great mass of the people, the fidelity with which they are represented, respect of the law, obedi ence to the dictates of SOUND MORALITY and in effectiveness and purity of admiration. Nowhere is this progress more marked than in Latin America. Out of the wreck of Indian fighting, race conflicts and civil wars strong and stable governments have arisen. Peaceful succession in accord with the people's will has replaced the forcible seizure of power PERMIT TED BY THE PEOPLE'S INDIFFERENCE. The rule of law supersedes the rule of man. Property is respected, individual liberty is respected, and the national faith is held sacred. This progress has not been equaled everywhere, but there has been PROGRESS every where. The present affords just cause for satisfaction, and the future i:s bright with hope. Not by national isolation have these results been accomplished. No nation can live unto itself alone and continue to live. The growth of each nation is part of the development of the 

RACE. THERE MAY BE LEADERS, AND THERE MAY BE LAGGARDU, BUT NO NATION CAN LONG CONTINUE FIRST IN THE ADVANCE OF THE GENERAL PROGRESS OF MANKIND, AND NO NATION NO" DOOMED TO EXTINCTION CAN REMAIN FARTHEST BEHIND. The Islander is pleased to note that the consolidation of the Bellingham Reveille and the Puget Sound American is not to result in the discarding.of the name of the former or in its sub ordination through hyphenation} or otherwise. The editor of this paper has been a reader of the Reveille ever since .it: first began carrying its morning messages to the people of the north west, sixteen years ago. During all of its history as the pioneer daily paper north of Seattle it has maintained an enviable repu tation for integrity and enterprise, conservatism and sound judg ment in its treatment of public questions of general importance, and it has seldom gone far astray in purely local matters. It would be little short of reprehensible to drop or belittle a name s which for a quarter of a century has been so prominently and < worthily connected with the development of- the northwest and j has occupied such an honorable place in the journalistic history 5 of the state.
