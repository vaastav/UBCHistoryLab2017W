Oar cossu are at least so far blockaded that we cannot ex change our surplus prodacts for either gold o (ho necessary arms, munition, and other things acedfal to the prosecation of ths war. I assume, therefore, without further remark that this war must be conducted- so far as Its flnau ces are concerned, upon credit; and that thir credit is expressed by tbe paper Juues, or promises to pay, of the Confederate States,-individual Statet Banks, and other corporations having authority tc create such issues. If this authority were confined to a single bod tnimated by the sole desire, w better from l tercei or patriotism, of maintaining unimpaired tbe rels tive value of its itsuea, ts compared with the ordi aary and necessary commodities of trade, then would be less reason for the grave apprehension; '.hat now fill the breast of every intelligent states man and patriot. This however is impracticable md it remains only, therefore, for eazh to folio v- ibe best dictates of its own judgment, and for eacl to assume voluntarily such sacrifices a patriotism ted the love of country may inspire. Paper issues have long been, and will perhapr -ontieue ts be the dernier resort of weak govern menu in a crisis like that through which we art .tow passing. Capital is always sensitive to thi teast approach of danger, and credit even more so In times like these, gold shrinks instinctively as i vre, back into the rnosfsecure and unsearchabl tiding places and nothing but the strongest temp ation can bring it to light.

But the creditor class mu?t ufler to just the extent that the deh or cites are (tee fitted. It would then be but another and more tJious, and far more dangerous and disastrous tyi em of bankrupt law, since it is but the tubstitu ion of a public debt for that of individuals. Take a single case A. borrows of B. ten thou and dollars, payable in sixty dajs. Hi iavests tbe whole amount in wheat at seventy-fire cents per ouahel. Being the debtor, he is, of course. tLe 'icnester man ot the t wo, and entitled to the sympathy tnd protection of legislator, jidge and jury, as igainst the unrelenting Shylock who insists on ayment under the absurd pretext that he need, .he money himself. He takes advantage of the aw'a delay, garners his wheat in some secure place until ptper issut-s tave become so abundant, that he readily exchanges his wheat witb the Gov srnmont for twenty thousand dollars In treasury notes. He has t.ius been enabled to exsncrate nimself from debt and pocket ten thousand dollars B. has at last got his ten thousand back again without loss, for he was getting interest all the ime. A is ten thousand dollars richer and no bod ajrt. Bat softly, A and B with the large pile of paptr oefore them begin toestimue its worth. But whether they wish to buy coin, or the neceeaarie if life, they find that the twenty thousand will onh bay what the teu thousand would have bought when the loan was made. A h oaly therefore five thousand dollars richer while B, (good for him he- had no business saving money to lend out at inter ett,instead of spending it as fast as he made it) finds himself five thousand dollas poorer. But aa A being a borrower mmt hare been a de ierving man, wnue a D.-mg a lender must time seen an extortioner of honest men, this wholo thing aaa seemingly resulted only in ihi transfer of (be (houtaud dollars from ths pocket ot the kbylock to mat of a need and a deserving man.

I&v We hive received by our "sub marine express" the Louisville Journal, of tbe Gib Inst., wh:sh is one day later .from the North than we have before ha& " The following editorial leader, on Lucolx's mes sage, is so remarksble au article, thai we transfer it in full to our columns : We are sorry to be constrained to acknowledge that the President's message is on the point of chut solicitude to thu conservative msn ot tbe countn ny no means satist tctory. nay, the message is on tha point deploraoly unsatisfactory. We make the contes.ion lranklr. becauie it is true, and because k oenooves tne inyal men of the country not only to lace the truth confessed bd firmly to grapple uUh il insianltj. ine point to wmch we refer is of course tbe lu t ire policy of tbe administration with respect to ilavery. Cencerniog this point in its principal spec; the XBfeesage contains tne foUswing pas sage : Also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well -i tbe obligations of law,insteaa of transcending, t have adhered to the act of Congres to confiscate property used lor insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon tbe ssme lulj-ct shall be proposed its pr- prietj will be duly considered The Union must be preserved, ,aud hence all desirable means ut be employed We uhould not be in haste to 'eteimino what radical and extreme measures which may reich the lojal, as well as tlsa disloyal. ire indi(.ensable." It is impossible to look upon this as anything more or less than the expression of an indirect and unmanly concurrence in tne policy asserted recent iv by CoL Cochrane and approved bv Secref-rv Cameron to the moniacution and shame of evry lojalminin Kentucky. The passsge is lacking in propriety as wolully as in statesmanship. Tbemtn nr is as bad as tbe matier. Both are deeply uo- wonny. i ne rresideat, witnoat boldly assuming ine responsiDiuty or recummeodingsuciiaconuica lion law aa the antislavery zealots demand, encour ages them to go forward ai.d enact their law: and without openly approver, the policy of emancipa tion. ne giv s the partisans ot tbe policy to under stand that ia the end they will not be disappointed In short the clear import of this passage of tbe uesssge is that not enly is the President not irre concilaoly bottile to radical coa"iels, but he enter- ams them kindly and even meditates their adop .ion. The pasage is virtually a hint to Congress hat. if that body will ti.ke tbe responsibility oi tutborizingor ot recommending extreme measures. '.he President will probably take tbe responsibility f approving them and of carrying them out. And the several Dills and resolu Ions proposing extreme measures which bare been already introduced into one or the other nousa witb oreroowenrz mam testttions of favor, show that Coogr ss will not be low to act upon thu bint Congress H apparent) nent on such action.

Dec C Tbe tat dispatches of Sec retary Seward to Mr. Adams are dated November 11. As snowing tbedirlemitic relation of England and the United States at that time, we copy it : Tbe case in regard to the pirates engaged by the insurgents of this country practically stands thus: Every moral Power and ever commercial Power except one practically excludes them from' their ports, except when in distress, or for any other visit of any kind longer than twenty-four hours and from coals except for twenty-four hoars con sumption, Great Briuss. as we are given to under atsnd by the answer of rl Russell, allows these pirates to visit her ports and stay at their, own pleasure, receiving aupplies withont restriction. We find it d ffi alt to believe that the Govern ment ot Great Britain hts constituted this excep ii m alter tall diliberation. I intimated in a pre ceding despatch a hope that the subject might be recoi sidered before it should be necessary for us to consider what .remedies we can adopt to prevent the evils which mast result to our commerce from the policy thus indicated by Great Britain. I have consulted on the subject with Lord L oca, and he may perhaps communicate with his g3vernnse.it thereupon. In tbe meantime I am directed by the President to instruct you to recall the attention ol hrr il)-s:y's Government to the question under the ii.fia.Eces of a spirit of peace and friendabip and with a desire to preserve what remains of s commerce mutually important to both countries. A rather sharp correspondence has taken place between Minuter Pike and the Government of the Qague, touching the reception ol the Sumpter at Caracea, which resulted in an ordr forbidding nther Jaff Davis' vessels or ours to stay more than twenty-four hours in tbe Dutch ports. Tt. this our Government exnressed a qualified gratifl cation as being the best argument practicable. At one point in the discuseisn, before the Dutch Government arrived at this conclaston.Mr. Seward wrote to Mr Pike that, unless tbe conduct of the Governor General of Curacoa is placed in a bettei light, it will become necessary to consider what means we can take to protect in the Drts cf Neth- erland oar national rights, which canuot be surren dered or compromisid Fpeciil Diipalih fo it Sew Trk Xvednj Putt. WaanisaTox Dec. 6. The President avows hi purpose to adhere to a cautious and prudent poll cy in relation to foreign affairs. There need be no apprehension of the occurrence of hostility betweei the United States and Great Britain. Unless thi British Government sbould seek a pretext for war (here is no ground for serious diflhulty. Tbe Gov rnment feels no a- xiety on this subject, believing that temperate policy will allay excited feelings and tend tacemnt the friindly relations between the two countries.
