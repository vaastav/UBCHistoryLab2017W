Mtlm WffMg WnM FISK BROS., - - R. E. FISK, - Editor. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 7. 1S83. THE MESSAGE. The President's message to Congress, of which we gave a portion yesterday, and give the whole to-day, though it may seem a lengthy document to look at as a wlioh', is really very brief considered in its treatment of the numerous questions included. It is a sound, sensible docu ment, aud will be read with satisfaction by the great majority of our people. With good reason the people regard these mes '-ages of the President with exceeding in terest. Virtually the President has a voice in legislation to the extent of one third of both houses of Congress. A pub lic recommendation of a pending measure of legislation is equivalent to a pledge that he will give his approval to such a measure when passed by both bouses of t ongre-s. THE 

REVENUE. More than was cveu expected the Presi dent lias favored the reduction of the rev enue-. As a matter of simplification of the collection of internal revenues, and ---; Publiahers. the release of the greater number of ofii- ; rial-, we have no doubt that tb- President j is right in recommending the abrogation of all tux on distilled spirits, but there are : other matters deserving We know of no good of consideration, reason whv all or the greater portion of relief from taxa- ! tion should go to the benefit of the manu- j facturer* of, dealers in, and users of dis- j tilled spirits. On the contrary, we thin the liquor business should at least be con tent with its proportionate share of reduc- i tion. If either branch of the internal revenue is to be abolished entirely, we would say let tobacco have the first j chance. Rut we do not favor either of j these steps; rather let all interests as far as possible share in the benefit of the re duction. Let the tax on spirits be re duced from 1*0 to 50 cents per gallon, and on tobacco from 16 to 8 coats per pound. We believe it would be better even for these interests not to have such an ex treme change made at once. Though it is said that this form of taxation is unpopu lar, it cannot be said that public opinion has any doubt about its being as just and equitable a way to raise part of the reve nue as any that has ever been devised. Our main reason, however, for retain ing in a reduced form taxes on both li quors and tobacco is that there may be greater room for reduction of tariff duties. Though believing distinctly in the doc trine of protection, we recognize the ne cessity for our manufacturers to adjust themselves and their interests to a des cending scale of duties iu anticipation of the time coming when they can go into all ] i i the markets of the world against all com petitors and not confine their vision to the home market alone. Our ambition for the United States is that it should not be merely a producer of raw material, as the policy of the Democratic party in tends, but a manufacturer also of this raw material, which is more profitable even than the production. And beyond this we aim to have our full share in the trans portation of both raw products and man ufactured articles. Any policy that does not aim at all of these objects we believe is defective. 

SHIPS AXP onIHNANCE. Among the disadvantages of our ship building interests the President does not mention the greater cost of material, as well as of labor, taxes and interest on money. We do not fall in altogether with the notions of the Secretary of the Navy that the place to begin a revival of our commercial marine is in building ships of war. It is beginning at the wrong end. It is the general opinion that it is impos sible under our system of naval boards to get a good or an economical war vessel constructed. If we have any war ships built they should be let to private builders. This is an era of big guns, and there is no good reason why we should not have the best if not the biggest in the world. We propose no aggressive warfare, but we are getting some large interests down along the seacoast that need the cover of the most effective guns that can be made. A certain measure of preparation lor de fense is the surest way to insure peace. 

POSTAL REDUCTION. Nothing could be better presented thau the President's views on the reduc tion of letter postage. Other postal re forms are desirable, but this is foremost and should be made at once. Civil. SERVICE REFORM. The words of the President on this sub ject will probably excite most surprise among many of his old political associates political opponent present.* . j and his t<»r himself he *ivc evidence to turiher than anv as well. As the most conelu Jiow that he has gone of his predecessors in j ! abstaining from removals from office. Without having aimed at any specialty in this line the President shows a record that rather silences the professional civil *crvice reformer. JRut he goes a great deal further than any one else before him in jiointing to the possibility of settling thi* reform in legal shape at once. He say* to Congress, Pass the bill now before you—the Pendleton bill—to the support of which the Democrats pledged themselves when they had little prospect of getting into office. Pass this bill aud send it to me and it shall have my approval forth with. Taking his official acts, his recom mendations and pledges, President Arthur is the best practical civil service reformer that lives to-dav. it is of a a a of ! 

DECAY OF SHIPPING INTERESTS. ! There is no subject of general interest on which such gross ignorance is mani . fested as in regard to the causes of the de cline of our shipping interests. The edi tor of the Independent , who would consider it a reproach not to be credited with the average intelligence of his party, used these words in his Sunday morning issue: "The Republicans have not been content to destroy the American navy, and make it a national reproach and disgrace, but they have swept the American mercantile marine from the oceans, as with a besom of destruction." This is a pretty broad charge to make for one who cares to be considered truthful. If this is true, it ought to be capable of being shown. And if the reasons given for the truth of the assertion cannot stand a moment's inves tigation, we are warranted to infer that no betterare held in reserve, and that the whole fabric built on the basis of false as sumptions is as unsubstantial as a mirage. It is asserted that our shipping took the lead in the carrying trade of the world down to 1860, when the Republicans came into power. Rut wasn't it about that same time that States Rights Democracy blos somed out into secession, open rebellion, and brought England the coveted oppor tunity to satiate her envy of our commer cial success. With hardly a pretense of ; observing neutrality, England was ready j to furnish privateers, she was swift to ac knowledge belligerent rights, and could : bave hardly done more under an open de claration of war. The animating cause of England's conduct was not so much ! sympathy with the cause of the South as j jealousy of our commercial rivalry. The j »South gave England the opportunity, and d a " from the sea i j j she was swift to improve it to sweep our Instead of damaging our commerce a paltry fifteen millions, the actual damage would have been under estimated at a thousand times that sum. If ever another war occurs between the United States and England, which we ] hope may never he, this debt will be i brought out aud collected in full. Eritish i privateers under the Confederate flag drove our commerce from the seas. Rut why did it not return when ihe war ended? The fact that it did not and nev has to this day, shows that other er causes have been in operation. It is easy to see what this cause has been, without being very sharp-sighted or witted. So long as ships were built of wood, America could easily lead the world, but when the time came that they were to be built of iron, England had the same advantage in her mines of coal and iron in close prox imity to each other and to the sea coast, with plenty of skilled and eheap labor. Here is a good reason, a full reason, the true reason without involving the necessi ty of dragging in any question of internal politics. Whether we had high tariff' or free trade would have mattered little or nothing. We cannot manufacture iron j anywhere in the United States under any circumstances as cheap as in England. We cannot get labor as cheap because here there is more opportunity for labor ers to set up for themselves on a frontier homestead. Free trade might give us a little more ocean commerce, but it would take away more land commerce, which is iu every way more desirable aud profitable. Nor has it been a dead loss to us as a nation that our capital has been withdrawn from the seas, for otherwise we should not have had our extensive railroad system com pleted, which has been of more value to us a hundred fold than all the ocean com merce of Great Britain. Rut we recog nize the fact that the time has come for our nation to begin again to compete for the rule of the seas. Our railroad system has reached the coast line, and its next extension must be on the water. How shall this be done? Can we expect ocean commerce to go back to wooden vessels? J It never will. Iron will be exchanged for 1 steel, but the era ol wood lias gone for * — - - -- & - ever. We might as well expect the agri culturist to reject the steel plow to return to the crooked stick of our primitive plowmen. Either one of three things. We must patiently wait the time that will come, though we can't say how soon, when it will cost more to manufacture iron in England and less in the United «States, or we must in some way pay out of the Na tional treasury a bounty to American ship builders that will compensate the extra cost, or we must change our registry law, passed in 1792 and allow an Ameri can registry to any vessel owned by Amer ican capital, no matter where it was built. As the case stands to-day,.if an Ameri can capitalist, wanting an iron or steel ship for any purpose, should submit his plans, the same in every particular, one to an American and another to an English ship-building firm, the English builder would take the contract at $100,000 less and make more money on the job than the American possibly could. No change of tariff laws can wipe out this margin of advantage that the Englishman enjoys at present. Rather than wait an indefinite time, and rather than adopt a system of bounties, we say let us have free trade in j ships and give a register on the strength ! of ownership. MEETING OF CONGRESS. According to the Constitution, Con gress meets to-day at the National Capi tal, and there is just three months till the 4th of March, when its term of existence expires. We somehow have an idea that it is going to be an eventful session. There is plenty to be done, and unless we greatly uiistake the disposition of the Republi cans, they will take the people at their word and give them retrenchment, civil service, etc., to their hearts' content, or leave the responsibility of its failure on the Democracy. de edi the but be it And the that the as the of ac de as our the we be SOUTH AMERICAN AFFAIRS. No one can find fault with the Presi dent's position towards the South Ameri can States. All seems to have been done consistent with our position of mutual friendship. If we would have gone fur ther we had need to put our army and navy on a war footing. Such armed in tervention the country is not prepared to recommend. If it were a strong foreign country that was seeking so to humiliate and dismember Peru, we have no doubt that the spirit of our people would not only approve but demand even armed in tervention. If we were to do more than tender our friendly offices in the quarrels of the Spanish-American States, we should be involved in endless and expensive wars in which there would be neither profit or glory. Very likely in the end we should incur the hostility of all these people as a recompense for our interference. We are not rich and strong enough to carry the game through to all its probable conse quences, and the game is not worth the powder. So long as we offer only our peaceful offices as umpire, the nations of Europe cannot be jealous, and the States that decline our kind offices must respect our motives and in time will be very will-1 ing to avail themselves of our active friendship. It is a pity that the peace convention called for last November, of all the na tions of this continent, was allowed to miscarry. We hope the mistake will be corrected at an early day, and the scope of questions to be discussed at such a con vention may be enlarged to include com mercial relations as well as those of peace arid war. Inter-oceanic canals and inter continental railways and telegraph wires So of in or or to will soon consolidate this whole continent into virtually one great republic, provided we can secure full reciprocity of trade. The President makes a strong point against Chili for persisting in her exces sive demands and the territorial dismem berment of her adversary, against the ad vice and kindly remonstrance of friendly powers. No nation can afford to place it self in such a position. Peru is not more I completely subdued now than was Ger many after the battle of Jena, yet sec how the position was reversed sixty years la ter. Chili is a very weak country—all length and no width. Almost every square mile of it is exposed to fire, and it may be cut into a dozen pieces by an en terprising enemy. Our sympathies were all with Chili throughout the war, nor has anything occurred to change our compara tive estimate of the two countries and people. For their own sake, their own strength, honor and peace, we wish the Chilians would be less overbearing and heavy handed in this hour of their tri umph. Their position will require the constant maintenance of an army and navy that will overwhelm them in debt, exhaust their resources, and divert their attention from the civilizing and profita ble activities of peace to the demoralizing, barbarizing and impoverishing occupa tions of war. We hope our government will put itself, out a great deal to court the favor of the South and Central American States. Let us have first class missions aud the very ablest and most influential Ministers to all these countries. Let us be well repre sented at Caracas iu July next, the cen tennial celebration of the birth of Boli var. That industrial exposition may be made the occasion of winning friends and good customers. Let us cultivate the arts of peace as generously as the nations of Europe do the arts of war, and as a result, within another century the wealth of the United .States will be greater thau that of all Europe, and if not as populous, at least possessed of more elements of strength. _ Democratic demagogues have made J some of the iron workers believe that their | J employers were making enormous profits. 1 lm der' shelter of excessive duties.

It owners ot the iron that it is not true, and the prospect of a possible reduction of those duties is clos ing up many establishments already. No one believes that mill owners would stop work while they were making good profits. Our opinion is that the interest of labor ers is as much involved as that of the cap italist in a protective duty on iron. If the laborer votes for a policy that closes the mills, he throws himself out of em ployment, for no one expects mill owners are going to do business and risk thèir capital for the fun of the thing, or even chiefly for the interest of those who do not know enough to see their own interests and help to protect them. Under the singular heading of "The Real Issue," the Independent this morning proceeds to deal itself and its party the even goes to the extent of declaring itself in favor of protection incidentally. Well, this is about all that the majority of the Republicans want, "a tariff that shall yield a sufficient revenue to the Govern ment and at the same time protect as much as may be home industries." Nobody in the Republican party advocates a prohibi tory tariff that we have heard of. The best answer to the charge that the tariff on iron and steel is prohibitory is the fact that over $20,000,000 of revenue came last year from these two items of import.

Washington, December 1, 1882. To the Senate and House o f Representatives of the United States : It is provided by the Constitution that the President shall from time to time give to Congress information of the state of the Union, and recommend to their considera tion such measures as he shall judge neces sary and expedient in reviewing the events of the year which have elapsed since the com mencement of your session. Foreign Affairs. First, your attention is called to the grati fying condition of our foreign affairs. Our intercourse with other powers has continued to be of the most friendly character. Such slight differences ashave arisen during the year have already been settled or are likely to reach an early adjustment. The arrest of citizens of the United States in Ireland under the recent laws of that country has led to a somewhat extended correspondence with the govern ment of Great Britain. A disposition to re spect our rights lias been practically mani fested by the release of the arrested parties. Inter-Oceanic Canal. The claim of this nation in regard to the supervision and control of the inter-oceanic canal across the American isthmus has con tinued to be the subject of conference. It is likely that time will be more powerful than discussion in removing the divergence be tween the two nations whose friendship is so closely cemented by the intimacy of their relations and the community of tlicir inter ests. Our Russian Relations. Our loug established friendliness with Russia has remained unbroken. It has , prompted me to proffer the earnest counsels i of this Government that measures be adopt to be of the of at of cd for suppressing the proscription which the Hebrew race in that country has lately suf fered. It has not transpired that any Amer ican citizen has been subjected to arrest or injury, but our courteous remonstrance has nevertheless been courteously received. There is reason to believe that the time is not far distant when Russia will be able to secure toleration to all faiths within her bor ders. Protection for Trade Marks. At an international convention held at Paris in 1880 and attended by représenta tives ol'the United States, an agreement was J | \ It a If reached inWespect to the protection of trade marks, patented articles and the rights of manufacturers and corporations. The for mulating into treaties of the recommenda tions thus adopted is receiving the attention which it merits. Submarine Telegraphy. The protection of submarine cables is a subject now under consideration by an inter national conference at Paris. Believing that it is clearly the true policy of this Govern ment to favor the neutralization of this means of intercourse, I requested our Minister to France to attend the convention as a dele gate. I also delegated two of our eminent scientific men to attend our representatives at the meeting of an international commis sion at Paris for considering the adoption of a common unit to measure electric force. In view of the frequent occurrence of con ferences for the consideration of important ! matters of common interest to civilized na tions, I respectfully suggest that the Execu tive be invested by Congress with discre tionary power to send delegates to such con ventions, and that provision be made to de fray the expenses incident thereto. Citizen Naturalization. The difference as to the effect of a judg ment and certificate of naturalization has not yet been adjusted, but it is hoped and be lieved that negotiations now in progress will ; j result in the establishment of the position ; I I in which seems to this government so reason able and just. Exports of Spain. I have already called the attention of Con-1 gress to the fact that in the exports of Spain ! and its colonies onerous fines have lately been imposed upon vessels of the United States for trivial, technical offenses against local regulations. Efforts for the abatement of these exactions have thus far proved un successful. I regret to inform yon, also, that the fees demanded by Spanish Consuls in American ports are in some cases so large when compared with the value of the cargo as to amount in effect to a considerable ex port duty, and that every remonstrance in this regard have not as yet received the at tention which they seem to deserve. German Exposition. « The German Government has invited the United States to participate in an interna tional exhibition of domestic cattle, to be held at Hamburg in July, 1883. If this country is to be represented it is important that in the early days of this session Con gress should make a suitable appropriation for that purpose. Diplomacy With Italy. The death of Mr. Marsh, our late Minister of is to Italy, has evoked from that government expressions of profound respect for his ex alted character and for his honorable career in the diplomatic service of his country. The Italian Government has raised a question as to the propriety of the recognition in hi$ dual capacity of the representative of this country, recently accredited both as Secre tary of Legation and of Consul-General of Rome. He has been received as Secretary, but his exequatus as Consul-General has thus tar been withheld. Extradition Treaty With Belgium. The extradition convention with Belgium, which has been in operation since 18?4, has been lately supplemented by another. The Senate has signified its approval, and ratifi cations have been duly exchanged between the two contracting countries. To the list of extraditable has been added that of the as sassination, or attempted assassination, of the Chief of State. Negotiations with Switzerland. Negotiations have been opened with Switzerland looking to a settlement by treaty of the question whether its citizens can denounce their allegiance and become citizens of the United States without obtain ing the consent of the Swiss government. I am happy to inform you that the immigra tion of paupers and criminals from certain of the cantons of Switzerland has substantially ceased and is no longer sactioned by the authorities. The consideration of the sub ject prompts the suggestion that the act o i August 3,1882, which has for its object the I return of foreign convicts to their own coun i try. should be so modified as not to be open to the interpretation that it effects the extra | dition of criminals on preferred charges of ; erime. Relations with Turkey. The Ottoman Porte has not yet as : seated to the interpretation which this government has put upon the treaty of 1830 in relation to its jurisdiction rights in Tur key. It is probable, however, that this difference will be adjusted by a general re vision of the system of jurisdiction of the United States iu the countries in which your I attention has lieen already called by the j Secretary of State. Mongolian Migration. The recent legislation restricting the im i migration of laborers from China has giveu rise to the question whether Chinamen pro I ceeding to or from another country may law fully pass through our own. Iu construing the act of May 6th, 1882, in connection with the treaty of November 1,1880, the restric tion would seem to be limited to Chinese immigrants coming to the United States as laborers, and should not forbid a mere transit across our country. I ask the attention of Congress to the subject for such action, if any, as may be deemed advisable. Interest in Liberia. This country has recently had occasion to 1 manifest an interest in the republic of Liberia by seeking to aid the amicable set : tlement of the boundary dispute now pend j ing between that republic and the British ! possession of Sierre Leone. Hawaiian Reciprocity, j The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will become terminable after September 0,1883, on two months notice by either party. While certain provisions of that compact may have proved onerous, its existence has fostered commercial relations which it is important to preserve. I suggest, therefore, that early consideration be given to such modifications of the treaty as seem to be demanded by the interests of our increasing trade with lroth Hayti aud San Domingo. 1 advise that pro vision be made for diplomatic intercourse with the latter by enlarging the scope of the mission at Port-au-Prince. I regret that a certain class of American claims against the government of Hayti have thus far been urged unavailingly. Mexican Indian Marauders. The arrangement with Mexico provides for the crossing of the frontier by the armed forces of either country in pursuit of hostile ! * ias been amicably settled, Indians. In my message of last year I call ed attention to the prevalent lawlessness on the borders and to the necessity of legisla tion for their suppression. I again invite the attention of Congress to the subject. A par tial relief from these mischief's has been sought in a convention, which now asks the approval of the Senate aud awaits action, as does another touching the establishment of the international boundary between the United States and Mexico. If the latter is ratified the action of Congress will lie re quired for the establishing of suitable com missions of survey. The boundary dispute between Mexico and ! Guatemala, which led this Government to proffer its friendly counsels to both parties, ! Yenezuela--Centcnnial Celebration. ; No change has occurred in our relations j with Venezuela. I again invoke your action ! in the matter of the pending awards against ! that republic, to which reference was made j by a previous message from the Executive at i your last session. ; An invitation has been received from the government of Venezuela to send represen tatives in July, 1883, to Carracas, for parti cipation in the centenuial celebration of the birth of Bolivar, the founder of South American independence. In connection with the event it is designed to commence the erection at Caraeeas of a statue of Wash ington and to conduct an industrial exhibi tion, which will be open to American pro ducts. I request that the United States be represented, and that suitable provision be made therefor. Chinese and Japanese Indemnity Fund. In the interest of justice toward China and Japan I trust that the question of the return of the indemnity fund to the govern ments of those countries will reach at the present session a satisfactory solution, which I have already recommended, and which has recently been foreshadowed by ; Congressional discussion. Corea and Egypt. The treaty lately concluded with Corea j awaits the action of the Senate. Daring the late disturbance in Egypt the ; timely presence of American vessels received recognition as a protection to the persons I and property of many of onr owncitizens, I and of the citizens of other countries, whose this governments expressed their thanks for ! assistance " ______________ side, and Chili on the other, began more . outli American Allairs. The elevation of the grade of our mission in Central America to the plenipotentiary rank, which was authorized by Congress at its late session, has been since effected. The war between Peril and Bolivia on the one than three years ago, on the occupation by Chili in 1880 of all the literal territory of Bolivia. Negotiations for peace were con ducted under the direction of the United States. The allies refused to concede any territory, but Chili has since become master oi the whole coast of both countries, and of the capital of Peru a year since, as you have already been advised by correspondence transmitted. In January last this government sent a special mission to the belligerent powers to express the hope that Chiu would be dis posed to accept a money indemnity for the expenses of the war, and to relinquish her demand for a portion of the territory of her antagonist. This recommendation, which Chili declined to follow, this government did ex The as hi$ this of has has The of as of by I of the o the of as this this re the the im as of if to of set the a the not assume to enforce nor tan it be en forced without resort to measures which would be in keeping neither with the tem per of oar people nor with the spirit of oui institutions. The power of Peru no longer extends over its whole territory, and in the event of our interference, to dictate peace would need to be supplemented by *he armies and navies of the United States Such interference would almost inevitably lead to the establishment of a protectorate result utterly at odds with our past policy injurious to onr present interests, and fall ot embarrassments for the future. For effec t ing the termination of hostilities upon terms at once jnst to the victorious nations and generous to its adversaries, this government has spared no efforts to save snch as might be involved by the complications which 1 have indicated. It is greatly to be deplored that Chili seems resolved to exact such rigor ous conditions of peace, and indisposed tn submit to arbitration the terms of an ami cable settlement. No peace is likely to be lasting that is not sufficiently equitable and just to command the approval of other nations. The Proposed Peace Congres*. About a year since invitations were ex tended to the nations of this continent to send representatives to a peace congress to assemble at Washington in November, 188 - 2 . The time of meeting was fixed at a period then remote in the hope, as the invitatiou itself declared, that iu the meantime the disturbances between the South American republics would be adjusted. As that ex pectation seemed unlikely to be realized, I asked for an expression of opinion from the two Houses of Congress as to the advisa bility of holding the proposed eonvention at the time apointed. This action was prompt ed in part by doubts which mature retie« - tion had suggested as to whether the diplo matic usages and traditions of the govern ment did not make it fitting that the Ex ecutive should consult the representatives of the people before pursuing a line of policy somewhat novel in its character and far reaching in its possible consequences. In view of the fact that no action was taken by Congress in the premises, and that no pro j vision had been made for the necessary ex penses. I decided to postpone the convention, and so notified the several government* which had been invited to attend. I am unwilling to dismiss this subject without as suring you of my support of any measures the wisdom of Congress may devise lor the promotion of peace on this continent and throughout the world, and I trust the time is nigli when, with the universal consent ol' the civilized peoples, all internal differences shall be determined without resort to arms— by the benignant processes of arbitration. Diplomatic Representation. Changes have occurred in the diplomatic representation of several foreign powers dur ing the past year. New Ministers from the Argentine Republic, Austria, Hungary, Bra zil, Chili, China, France. Japan, Mexico, the j Netherlands, and Russia have presented j their credentials. The missions of Denmark i and Venezuela at this capital have been j raised in grade ; Switzerland has started a i plenipotentiary mission to this government, and an embassy from Madagascar and a Min ister from Siam will shortly arrive. < >ur di plomatic intercourse has l>een enlarged by the establishment of relations with the new kingdom of Sierra, by the creation of a mission to Siam, and by the restoration of the mission to Greece. The Shah of Persia has expressed his gratification that a Charge d'Affairs will shortly l>e sent to that country, where the rights of our citizens have been hitherto courteously guarded by the repre sentatives of Great Britain. Security on the High Sea*. I renew my recommendation of such leg islation as will place the United States in harmony with other maritime powers with respect to the international rules for tin prevention of collisions at sea. In conformity with your joint resolution of the third of August last, I have directed the Secretary j of State to address the foreign governments on , in respect to a proposed conference for con j sidering the subject of the universal adop the j tion of a common prime meridian to In j used in the reckoning of longitude aud in as of the is re to at be | 1 ! the regulation of time throughout the civi ; lized world. Their replies will in due time j be laid before you. Exchange ot Publications. ) Au agreement was reached at I'aris in 1 187.'» between the principal powers for the j exchange of official publications, through ! the medium of the representatives of their ! foreign departments. The admirable system j which has been built up by the enterprise j of the Smithsonian Institute affords a prac j tical basis for our cooperation in this scheme, and an arrangement has been effected where j by that institution will perform the nee I essary lal»or under the direction of the De i partaient of State. A reasonable «-ompensa l tion. therefore, should he provided by law. Diplomatie and Consular Service. A clause in the act making an appaopria* : tion for the diplomatic aud consular service ! contemplates the reorganization of bot« branches of such service on a salaried basis, leaving the fees to inure the benefit of the treasury.
