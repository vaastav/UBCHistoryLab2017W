Pixley, representative of the state council of defense for Wiscon sin, has written a series of articles for the Chicago Tribune, revealing A. C. Townley*s Nonpartisan league in North Dakota in its true light as a socialistic, un-American organization. It has captured North Dakota and has foothold in Minnesota, South Da koto and Wisconsin. It is trying to get a start in Iowa, and it is import ant that Iowans, and particularly Iowa farmers, understand the facts with regard to its campaign. •To quote Mr. Pixley: g§f If you walk into the headquar ters of the Nonpartisan league in St. Paul, Minn., where A. C. Townley, the former Beach, N. D, farmer, who built the league, is to be found, you probably will 4e greeted by the sight of a large American flag. If you asked if the league is helping to win the war, you would be told, undoubtedly, that it is the most important factor, because food is the most important factor and its members all are engaged in the production of food. If you asked Mr. Townley if he helped float the last Liberty Loan he would answer in the affirma tive. .The league is loyal if you ask its organizers. As a matter of fact, when its in fluence is considered, the Non partisan league is one of the greatest assets of the kaiser and his allies, especially in the great northwest, proudly proclaimed by its citizens as the bread basket of the world. Not because its mem bers have not sent their sons to war. Many of them volunteered and many, more are in the nation al army camps. Not because its members refused to buy Mberty Bonds, because many of them did buy, but because the whole trend of thought in the league is against government. It is socialistic. The socialists do not believe in this •f )•, and the organizers and heads /.Cr the Nonpartisan league are so ciallsts. The Nonpartisan league captured I the North Dakota houfee, and, in re iponse to the urging of John H. Worst, then president of the North Dakota Agricultural college, the league lead era decided to abolish the state's con stltutlon so they might have state socialism. They framed a new consti tution which would have put the state Into bankruptcy, but fortunately its adoption was blocked by the holdover senators after it had gone through the bouse on a strict party vote. The league may obtain a majority of the senate in future elections, and if It does the future of North Dakota Is sealed. For Instance, one of the sections in the proposed constitution reads as follows: The state, or any political sub [^Sfdivision thereof, may issue or guarantee the payment of bonds )n excess of the debt limit speci 'Silled in this article provided such bonds are secured'by first mort £*ages upon real estate or upon -property of public utilities or in f,f|'dustries. This section not only authorized the Issuance of the state, county, town ihip, city or village bonds without lim ft for "public utilities, enterprises or industries," but, in connection with Cud other section, made the state school treasury from which these bonds without limit, except the limit of the fund, might be cashed. The present constitution contains a provision which safeguards public funds by making the private use of such moneys an embezzlement. This section was omitted entirely. Mr. Pixley closes one of his articles with this paragraph: The experience in North Dako (ijsfcita is indicative of the program ^contemplated in other states. Of '%imore importance at this period of tpiour national history, however, is blithe attitude the Ndnpartisan Vr league takes on the prosecution of the war It proclaims \ts loy- taltyas from the housetops, but it goes as near to the limit of the r".»ilaW it dares. It has hampered $2 the work of patriotic people and organizations wherever its Uter is ature has been circulate^, not by "-bold statements which might incur the punishment given to convict ed traitors, but by insidious at tacks, carefully veiled, which have an influence not to be underesti mtaed. Iowa farmers and working men are ftaing asked to become members of the Nonpartisan league. Its prom ises and prospectus are cleverly framed. Its organizers are convincing talkers. It is essential that the truth about its real identity and its real aims be kept before the minds of loyal Iowans so that its iniquitous influence phaii not be permitted to fasten ex travagance and socialism upon this state. THE 

COAL PROBLEM. The Bache Review, frankly an or gan of what is ballad "big business,' Age-Gazette's view of the coal sltua tion in the following manner: The coal rituation is the most serious national menace-r-a men' ace, as the Railway Age-Gazette says, to the prosperity of the country and to the success of its military operations. One hundred million tons of production in 1917 over 1916 were estimated to be necessary in order to meet the industrial and military needs of the country this year. At the end of October the increase was only 41,000.000 tons ahead of the same period in 1916. "In consequence, there is a, general shortage of coal for domestic, for industrial, and for other purposes. The concerns engaged in the manufacture of munitions complain that maximum output by them is prevented by inability to get sufficient- coal. The railroads are in danger of not being able to get enough. The householders in communities all over the country are being ra tioned by their sellers and ljve in constant dread lest they shall be finable to keep themselves warm this winter." The Gazette claims that thjs condition of shortage and failure to produce the amount needed for the year is due to operators not having dealt with labor in a suffi ciently liberal spirit to keep up production, with the result that mines all over the country have been shut down. The real fault, however, appears to have been in an arbitrary fixing of prices below the point where production would be stimulated, and, in fact, below the point where the smaller con cerns could, without loss, continue to mine. The result has been the shutting down of these smaller concerns, affecting a round per centage of the total. As a matter of fact, much of the shortage in coal is the result of the iniquitous custom which has grown up through many years of practice and by which the railroads and public utili ties concerns have been able to con trol the coal industry and the prices at which coal has been sold not only to them but to the public. The failure of the public to buy coal in summer time even at compara tively lower prices than prevailed in winter has made it necessary for coal operators to sell to bis consumers railroads and public utilities—at prof itless prices in order to keep mines in operation during the summer months. This could have been met by govern ment supervision years ago, and it is to be hoped that the present federal fuel administration will Jeal with the situation before next year. The solu tion lies in the establishment of storage facilities for coal, so that the summer's surplus can be stored for winter distribution and consumption. This would make an increase in the cost of summer coal, owing to the ex pense of storage and extra handling, but it would preserve a supply, per mit mines to work throughout the year, enable operators to keep their forces of men intact and prevent pan ic prices as well as winter shortages of coal. Any increase due to storage cost would be equalized in the long run by the lower average price which would be the result of an unfailing supply and abolishment of the contrticf "sys tem by which railroads and utilities have forced private consumers to pay the profit on all the coal produced. THE 

CHALLENGE TO US. Thdre is much food for thought in the declarations by Field Marshal Hin denburg and General Ludendorff, re ported in Associated Press disoatches yesterday. Local defeats and the sur render of shell-torn, smoke blackened terrain. Hindenburg says, are of no moment in deciding the outcome of the war. Lude.ndorff declares that bat- ties do not win wars now. but thn spirit of the peoples engaged in the, struggle. There are no decisive sejtions by the two men who are at the head of Germany's fighting forces' news of further retreats in Flanders jng* or farther south. But it is a fact th:u spired by German or British minds. a,one-painstaking the kaiser's arms have been framed laboriously by the general staff and the same agency has elaborated like the yellowest journal on .the story of every German victory. Chancellors have proclaimed to the reichstag and to the German public the invincibility of the submarine and of Hindenburg's armies, and nothing has been left un done to keep the German public loyal through the varying fortunes of the imperial warriors. On the other hand, nothing of low intrigue, of barbaric plotting, Inhuman butchery or wanton destruction of property has been omitted in the cam paign Germany is waging to discour age the peoples of enemy countries Bernstorff practiced in America we know the fate of the Lusitania we know how Argentina't little merchant vessels and their crews were marked for utter destruction.

McElroy re moves one of the men who did much to create a high standard for the agri cultural development of Wapello coun ty. More than thirty years ago he came to Ottumwa, at a time when the possibilities of Iowa's rich farming sections were only beginning to b'? realized. His progressiveness and th« success which it brought encouragcd others in the community, and every movement looking to further develop ment of the county's resources receiv ed his encouragement. Several years ago Mr. McElroy served the county as a member of the board of supervisors, and gave to his work as an official the same measure of industry and business judgment that had won his individual success. Road and bridge improvement and the careful stewardship of the coun ty's funds were notable features of his administration. The farm is the basis of Iowa's pro gress. Tlie generation of faVrnefs'to which Mr. McElroy belongs has laid the foundtaion for' further advance ment of the future. Their pioneer work bequeaths to those who succeed them the opportunity to achieve great er development of the states vast pos sibilities. A WAR COUNCIL.

AMERICA'S WAR AIMS. A careful reading of President Wil son's message, delivered to congress yesterday, will supply ample answer and united ito all those who have demanded and other countries fiSht*n8 ciding blow. The prance's' marvelous courage, And Eng land's stubborn grit depends on us, for here is the world's storehouse. Here are the foodstuffs and the money which can prevent starvation in the European countries with which we arc allied. Ours is the opportunity to strengthen those peoples and our own armies, by ourselves "keeping a stiff upper lip." But we must not permit our optimism to be founded on anything less substantial than JstiU pies, the people of the United States, back here at home, must^strife« the de-, our are to be heard l°*^e TTnitoH af- !know the nature of America's war knowledge that we and everyone on whom wo can exert the least influence are doing everything ppssible to make victory a certainty. Loyal support of the Red Cross and the other legitimate war work funds, conservation of food and other resources, unfailing industry in every productive trade—these are the means by which each of us can ex press his patriotism, and must, if we are to win in the war of peoples. To national defense which as- sumes to be a supreme war council u'ia ,ime for times, he adds. jneton to recognize the need for a At first reading, perhaps, these a.vj 1 officialdom in Wash- centralizpd war authority which can- influenced by political ambl- tlonR or considerations. It is time to tics. an(j center front and. possibly, a means of pre- maximum force upon the task of win paring the German public for the the whole nation's demanding to Summod up in languagft ieS8 elegant than the president's these aims, as he enumerates them are: To crush or at least to banish from the councils of the nations the militaristic power of the Ger man government To discuss peace with the Ger man people only when they shall be represented in the peace coun cil by spokesmen whom the world can trust and who are winding to accept the common judgment of the other nations as to the future bases of international law and hu man rights To demand absolute justice to ally and enemy alike in the settle-, ment of the questions arising from the present war To permit no nation selfish profit as a result of victory over any other obtain reparation of Bel­ gium's wrongs To insure Belgium and France against invasion To free Austria-Hungary, the Balkan states. Turkey and its de pendencies from German domina tion To liberate the Teutonic, peo ples from the absolutism of the militaristic autocracy which has enslaved them, but without inter fering with their internal politics and without demanding dissolu tion of either the German or Aus tro-Hungarian empire To prevent any of the nations with which America is allied from interfering with peaceful enter prises of Germany as a mistaken and selfish means of avenging the wrongs Germany has done in the war To permit peoples to determine the form of government under which they shall live, provided it shall not give a ruler autocratic power. •-4Y *.-• Certainly thore can be no criticism of this catalogue of objects on the score of indefinite ness with the possible exception of a single point. That has to do with the manner in which the German public, enBlaved as it is by the kaiser's mili tary absolutism, is to give assurance to the world that its government will abide by a treaty of just peace, unless one of two things shall have transpir ed in the meantime. These alterna tives are Either the kaiser must be forced by the German people to substi tute for his autocracy a constitu tional government, or The armies of the United States and our allies must administer a military defeat to Germany which shall give the victors the right, to demand governmental reform in the empire of the Hohenzollerns as a purging through which the kaiser must pass before his en voys may be admitted to the peace councils as Germany's represent atives. At least the president has silenced the critics who declared his note in reply to Pope Benedict demanded abdi cation by the kaiser. The demand was not made in so many words, and offi-Jicapable. a possibility that the arguments of the president will appeal. Obviously, then, it behooves us and the peoples with who^n we are allied to support the fearless statement of peace terms by convincing not only the German "pe'ople but the German monarch as well that their military de feat is inevitable. Thus the whole thing comes back to' the question of armed strength and to the necessity for armed superiority on the part of ourselves and our allies. With us it means more, for we have undertaken not only to furnish an army, but to feed it and our allies, and to furnish supplies and money with Vocal appreciation of the president's eloquence and forceful language does not help one whit to Win the war. He has told the world what Germany must do to obtain peace, but he and all the world know that only a series of mili tary reverses can force either the Ger man public or the German monarch to meet the conditions he names. And those military reverses will be possi ble to inflict only if you and I give our utmost service to the government in support of the policies to which the president's message commits us. state of war wfiich in fact has existed for many months. it is of the highest importance that we "clear away all impediments to success," as the president says, "and make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole, capacity and force as a fighting unit." Although there is no reason to be lieve that he had it in mind, the A feature of the president's message which cannot be passed without com ment, and one, too, which replies to those critics of the governments war policy who have declared America was being made a victim of the greed of her European allies, is the declaration that, in the event of victory over the kaiser's autocracy, "we shall be free to base peace on generosity and justice to the exclusion of all selfish claims o^ advantage even on the part *',c™rs* This is definite notice to England, France and Italy that territorial aggression and the cornering of wofld markets shall not be permitted as a result of any victory in which America may be interested.

With Jolly Robin following close behind him, Jasper Jay flew directly to the cross-roads, almost half way. to the village. Once there, he perched himself upon the sign-post at the four corners. And Jolly Robin set tled himself upon one of the boards that were nailed to the post. "Here we are!" said Jasper Jay. "You see how easy it is." "When will the post begin to move?" Jolly Robin inquired a bit anxiously. He had waited a whole day to begin his long journey to the south so it was only natural that he should want to start at once. "What's that you say?" asked Jas per Jay. And when Jolly repeated his question Jasper began to scream with laughter. "Well, that's a good one!" he said at last. So you thought the post was going to pull itself out of the ground and fly away with you, did you?" "Why, yes!" Jolly Robin replied. "Aren't these wings?" he asked, look ing down at the boards. "They're al ready spread." he observed. It was some minutes before Jasper Jay could answer him, for he was The decisive break with Austria was inevitable. It is a proper step toward laughing again.

All you need do is to follow this road to which the hand points." Then I shall have to fly, after all," Jolly Robin said. He had expected to haile a ride. And naturally he was disappointed.
