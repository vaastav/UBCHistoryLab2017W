BDLKELEY'S PLEDGE TO 00V. Sl'LEAN . STATEMENT MADE THAT SENA- . TOR PROMISED SOT TO TBI' FOR ANOTHER TERM. Down In this part of the state there - cornea a general ". statement on the part of certain Republicans, says the 2ew Tlaven correspondent of the '. "Hai-troi-tl Times, that there was gentlemen's agreement made between Senator Bulkeley and ex-Governor McLean that the former would not enter the senatorial fight for another term. It was stated that this agree ment was made In the presence of a third party, a prominent tiaruoro county man. Rank and file Kepub- . licaos hereabouts who have heard of thia agreement are wondering- how ' much foundation there is to the story: They think that if such an agreement was made that it could be easily veri fied and that the witness of such an understanding is one of those fear less. Independent individuals who - wouldn't hesitate to come out pub licly and declare whether the story ' was a dream or a fact. The friends of Qeorge P. McLean In this part of the state who have heard of the agreement do not hesitate to say that if Senator Balkeley was a party to any such agreement he should pull right out of the senatorial race and . leave the field free and open to Gov- ernor McLean or whoever wanted to oppose his candidacy. One of the McLean men made this statement: ' "From what I can learn after an '- investigation of this report I am sat isfied that governor McLean would ' neve- have-gone Into the senatorial fight had he beiWed for a moment 'that Senator Bulkeley would . run again or" would run against him. We all know; how1--inttmate- -these . two' gentlemen have 'been in the past poli tically, and we all know that they have been the -very warmest kind of friends. It is true now that they are . friends to-day but hardly in the same sens as that which marked their inti macy in days gone by. With this well-known friendship between those two leaders in the Republican party, ,it doesn't strike the McLean men in Connecticut that McLean' would de liberately go into a contest for a seat . now . occupied by Senator Bulkeley." An ardent Union League c! a b sup porter of Senator Bulkeley when he was asked about this reported agree nent between the senator and the x-governor characterised the story as merely a game of talk.. He added: "If there was a third party present at the time it was sHd that the two men made the agreement it would be a Very easy matter in my judgment s to get a statement from the third party that would settle all further controversy on this point. I think myself that had such am agreement been made the statement of the wit ness thereto or of any other witness would have long aao appeared in print and set at rest the disputed point. I don't think that Senator Bulkeley with his well-known politi cal shrewdness would handicap him self for Bis , political ambitions by making any such arrangement with . Governor McLean or any other K publican in the state.'

Board of Aldermen conveys the Impression of a close knowledge of and familiarity" with the gov ernmental affairs of the city, and such Is undoubtedly the fact, for his prolonged experience as City Clerk has made him fully acquainted with municipal conditions. He recommends the application of business principles and rightly asserts that the city's finances should be placed "on a sound basis." True economy Is not, he says, the overlooking of needed public Im provements, but rather such as "will not delay progress 6r postpone necessary Improvements." Equalization of taxation, by which is meant the full value assesa ments which are required by law, has been promised, and that prom ise "must be scrupulously kept." The Mayor suggests that the electric light investigation be con tinued, as a possible means of obtaining reductions In both public, and private rates. He recommends the purchase of dock frontage adjoining the small city dock at the foot of Wall street. Mentioning the fact that the new State tax will add a mill to the annual tax rate, he suggests economy of expenditure else It "will rise beyond reasonable bounds. He Indicates a disposition to push the placing of the principal ar teries of travel in first class condition, a most worthy purpose. He expresses regret over the loss of harbor area, and suggests a careful watch against further injury to the harbor. But for the doubt whether the contract entered Into by the previous administra tion with the railroad can be overturned, he might, and ' probably would, have made a recommendation upon that matter. But for the reference to equalization of ' taxation, the message might have won the approval of the Taxpayers League. If. how ever, it meets the wishes of the thousands of other voters. Mayor Buckingham can dispense with the league's approval. V THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE President Taft's message to Congress deals at somewhat greater lengti than has been the Presidential custom with foreign affairs, perhaps In recognition of the current belief that this country has be come "a world power" instead of an Isolated and negligible Item in the list of nations. A very significant statement in the message Is that "the appre hension which gave rise to the Monroe Doctrine may be said to have nearly disappeared" and that neither It nor any other Amer ican policy "should be permitted to pperate for the perpetuation of irresponsible government, the escape of Just obligations, or the insid- ; kus allegation of dominating ambitions on the part of the United State." ' I Upon the matter of tariff revision, the President has appointed the new Tariff board, with Instructions "to secure information as to the cost of production of such goods In this country na the cost of their production In foreign countries." This Is the information which should have been secured by the Congressional tariff-revising committees, but was not. The President states that if such Infor mation shows "that the rates of duties Imposed by the present tariff are excessive" under, the Republican protective principle formulated last, year that Is. more than the difference In cost of production, with W reasonable profit" he will not hesitate to Invite action by Congress. But he anticipates that the work of Investigation "will take two or three years." The President cons.Jers "economy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue" as "perhaps the most Important question" pending. , He states that the estimates for expenses for the year ending June 30th next aggregate $12,818,000 less than the Appropriations, and that the Treasury anticipates a surplus of $35,831,000.' Departmental esti mates,' he saya, "have been cut t the quick,", while "projects and improvements" have been postponed. He 'advocates the dismissal, withe pensions, f "old employees who have outlived their energy and usefulness" as "Indispensible to any proper system of economy.1 ''"'.'"" e In the matter of probing the sugar frauds, the President . depre cates an investigation by Congress as it 'might by giving Immunity and otherwise prove an embarrassment in securing conviction of the guilty parties." Can the President mean that a Congressional com--mlttee would knowingly permit "those higher tip" In the Sugar Trust to escape punishment by calling them " as witnesses and grant ing Immunity in exchange for evidence? s If so, he has' become dis trustful of "the powers that be". In Congress, and In our judgment, with good reason. ' , ; J . With regard to the maximum and minimum clause of the tariff act, President Taft cites the words "unduly discriminatory" . and In terpret then! as meaning that the maximum rates are not to. be Im posed unless he finds discriminations that are "without good and fair reason." He does not expect any tariff war on account of the clause in the tariff act, and says: "No one Is seeking a tariff war or a condition in which the spirit of retaliation shall be aroused." This assurance will quiet Canadian apprehensions and perhaps check Ca-. nadian threats of retaliation. ' In the Interest of economy, the President has ordered a reduc tion of 145,000.000 in War Department estimates, by "cutting off new projects and suspending for one year all progress In military mat ters". Including therein non-recruiting of the army up to its present authorised strength. , He recommends the retirement of officers who "do not show such aptitude and skill and character for high com , mand" as to justify their eventual promotion. " Of our coast defenses, the President thinks that "In some re spects they are rather more elaborate than' under present conditions ere heeded to stop an enemy's fleet from entering the harbors de fended." ' He suggests, however, the erection of a fort at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, and the establishment of ' "an extensive naval base of Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not in the Philippines." He has cut down the estimates for naval appropriations by $38,-' 000.000, and for new 'naval construction to two first-class battleships and one repair vessel. This Indicates that, he iees no necessity for this country to take part Id the British-German -competition over the construction of great fleets of dreadnoughts.. .. The President classes as "the greatest need lri our American in stitutions" a "change in Judicial procedure, with a view to reducing" Its expense to private litigants In civil cases and ' facilitating the dispatch of business and final decision in both civil and criminal cases." He recommends a commission of Investigation,' which shall "make recommendation with a view to simplifying and expediting the procedure as far as possible and making It a inexpensive as may be to the litigant of little means." With regard to Injunctions, the President recommends the enact ment of a law forbidding the Issuance of any Injunction without pre vious notice and hearing, unless the court finds from evidence that otherwise "immediate and Irreparable Injury Is likely to ensue", and in such case the Injunction shall expire In seven days or less. Suggestions of amendments of the Anti-Trust and Interstate Com- . merce laws ace promised, to appear in a special message. . Referring to the annual deficit In the Post Office Department, the President suggests the imposition of a higher rate of postage upon magazine and periodicals, they being "mach heavier than News papers" and containing "a much higher ' proportion of advertising to reading matter", while "the average distance of their transportation is ' three and a half times as great." "The real necessity and entire practicability of establishing postal savings banks". Is urged by the President. He believes that "they will be productive of the utmost good", and he does not approve the Aldrlch plan of postponing action until after the report of the Monetary Commission. He does "not see why the one should be tied up with the other", from which we Infer that he does not favor mak ing postal savings banks mere subsidiaries of a great central bank. He advocates ship subsidies for lines between our Atlantic sea board and the eastern roast or South America. well an lines from the wet coast of the United States to South America. China.. Japan, and the Philippines. He promises an early special message ou the conservation of na I tional resources, including Improvement of waterways, reforestation, and preservation of water-power sites. le recommends that candidates for Congress and campaign com mittees be required to file statements of contributions and expendi ture a point not covered by the existing law. ' Presumably the recommendation refers to candidates for the Senate as well as the House. In conclusion President Taft predicts "a substantial business ex pansion", and attributes the high cost of living to the increase In gold production and "the, more expensive mode of living", but refuses to", accredit the tariff with any responsibility. Upon the latter point, his new Tariff board may throw a light to change his opinion. As compared with his predecessor's messages. President Taffs deliverance Is brief. It contains no pyrotechnics and does not even remotely refer to "malefactors of great wealth": ' possibly, this omission will be remedied In the promised special messages. Its most praiseworthy feature Is the reference to the necessity of economy. We recommend its careful consideration; possibly, readers will reach the conclusion that the Rooseveltian policies have indeed been abandoned. tel. seia The Royal Hotel and Cafe
