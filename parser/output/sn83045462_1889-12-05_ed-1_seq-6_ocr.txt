PKAISE FROM THE OTHER SIDE. A Conservative Democrat'* Opinion of the President's Message There are still but few men in Congress who have read the President's menage with care and are ready to express anything more than a general opinion on it. The great mass of democrats will speak of it slightingly and the republican* will praise it, whether they have read the message or not. Some few on both sides, with whom The Stab reporter has talked b ive considered the document carefully and there is no very widejdifference in their estimate ?f it. They generally agree that it is just such a document as they expected; that it is conser vative in its tone and that the propositions are clearly stated. There is a difference of opin ion among democrats as to the declarations. coscnxiso THE 

SCPEKVIHION OF ELECTIONS. Some of the southern men declare that the President has taken a radical position on the subject and they are disposed to criticize him severely. Other democrats, who have given especial attention to this clause, say that they reg.:rd it as conservative. Mr. Mutclilerof Pennsylvania, speaking with a Star reporter, stated practically what a num ber of other thoughtful democrats had said. He thought that the utterance on the super vision of elections was conservative and that it did not agree with what had come to be the popular impression of what the policy of the republican party would be. He said be thought the I'resident took issue with the followers of the Sherman Idea of a federal election law and that, while maintaining the right of Congress to take charge of congressional elections, held that such action was not necessary and not politic. He said he thought it indi cated that the republican party was not of one mind on this subject, and he would venture to say that the effect of the President's message would be to prevent the passage of any such bill as that proposed by Senator Sherman. 

SPEAKING OF THE TA&IFF CLAUSE in the message. Mr. Mutcliler said he could not ?ee. as far as the simple declaration went, that Mr. Harrison differed far from Mr. Cleveland, exccpt as to the tobacco tax. He declared that there should be an enlargement of the free list, and for a revision of the tariff, with proper re gird for the protection of the interests of American capital and labor. This was practi cally incidental protection, as Mr. Cleveland had advocated it. It was not. in Mr. Mutcliler's opinion, at all in accord with tha republican platform, adopted at their last national con vention. it was more in accordance with the earlier platforms of the party. liiLLS NEvT AND OLD.
