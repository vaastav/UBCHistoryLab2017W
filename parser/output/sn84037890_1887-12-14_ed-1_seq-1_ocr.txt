'Dotibtleia it is about bushier of tho state, for I know that thou art ever full of gicat Ideas and plans for my welfare and my people's. So. even ns 11 queen should I havo come, though I neatly fear tho dark nloiie;' mid again iho and gavo him n glanco fi 0111 her gi ay eyes. At this point I thought It w Iso to movo n llttK'.slnco Mfrets"of tho state" should not Iw m.ulo public jirojierty, but she would not let mo go far, tiereniptorily stopliig mo ithln flvo vninU or so. saying that sli f enrol surprl.se. Bo it camoto jmss that, however unwillingly, I heard all that passed. "Thou knowest, Nylepthn,"sald Sir Henry, 'that (tutu fornono of thesa things thnt I nsked thco to 1110 at this lonely place, waste not tho tlmo in pleasantry, but listen to inc, for I lovo thee." As ha wild tho 11 01 ds I saw her face break tip, as It weio, mid change. Tho coquetry went out of It, nnd In iti placo thero shone a great light of lovo, which seemed to glorify it, and niako it like that of tho mnrblo nngel overhead. I could not help thinking that it must havo lieoii 11 touch of piophctlc Instinct which made tho long dead ltadcnias llmuiii tho features of tho ungcl of his lmplring vision b) si inngon likeness of his own descend-ant. Kir Heniy nUo must hnvoobservcu und Ui'ii struck by tho llkeniss, for, catching tlio look uiwii Njleptha'a face, ho glanced quickly from it to tho moonlit statue, and then back ngaln ut his belovwl. "Thou uayest thou dost lovo me," sho said, In o low voice, "and thy voice rings true; but bow am I to know that thou dost sjwak tho truth? Though," sho wenton, with proud humility, and iu tho stately third person which Is so largely used by tho "I bo as nothing In tho eyes of my lord" and tho couvtesicd towards him "who conies from ninon' a w utidci f ul people, to whom my peo ple uro butililldii.il, ct hero nml a queen and u leader of men, mid if I would go to a battle n hundred thousand spears man sporKio in my (lain llko stars glluiuieiing down tho path of tho lient moon.

Let my lord pardon mo if I weary my lonl, but It hath pleased my lord to say that ho loves mo, Nyleptha, a queen ot the ZU'Vnult; and therefore would I say, thut though my lovo nml niy hand bo not much to my lord, jet to 1110 aro they nil." 'Ohl"sho cried, with 11 sudden and thrilUi g change of volee, and 11 odlf ylng her dignified modoof ndiliesi "oh, how can I know that thou lovost but niol How can I know that thou w lit not weary of 1110 mid seek thlno own place again, leaving me desolnto? Whl U thero to tell 1110 but that thou lovest somo other woman, somo fair woman unknown to me, but who yet draws breath beneath this Mine moon that shines on mo to-night? Tell tno how mil I lo knoivP And she clasped her hands and stretched them out towards him, mid looked appoallugly into his fnco. "Nyli'pthn," answered (Sir Henry, ndopting tho way of havo told thco thnt I lovo thro; how am I to tell thco how much I lovo thco! Is there, then, n measure for lovo? Yet wlil I try. I say tiU that I havo novcr looked upon another woman with favor, but this I hay, that I love thco with all my llfo and with all my strength; that 1 lovo thco now, and shall lovo theu till I grow cold in death, ayo, and as I bollcvo, boyond my death, and on and on forever; I say lhat thy Tolooismujiloto my car, and tby touch ai water to 11 luirsty land; that when thou art thero tho woild h lienultful, nud when I see thoo not It Is ns though tho light was dead.

Kyleptha. and at thy side will I die." Ho paused and enzod nt her earnestly, but ho hung her head llko a Illy, and said never n wuru. Mfii: lieore the ttatue. "Look I" ho wenton, pointing to tho fctatuo I 011 which the moonlight played so brightly. I "Thou seest that nngel woman who rests her hand upon tho forehead of tho sleeping man; unit thou seest how nt her touch bis soul flames up nnd shlnei out through his flesh, even ns n lamp nt the touch of tho Are; so Is , it with 1110 nud thee, Xyleptha. Thou host ' my foul nud called it forth, and now, Nyleptha, it is not mine, not mine, but 1 thine, and thine only. Thero is no moro for 1 1110 to say; In thy bands Is my llfo. And he I leaned back against tho pedestal of tbo ' statue, looking very pale, nnd his eyes shin ing, but proud and hniidsonio us a god. Klowly, slowly she raised her head, and filed her wonderful ei'es, nil alight with tho greatness of ber passion, full upon bis face, as though to read his very soul. Then nt last sho spoke, low Indeed, hut clearly as a silver bell: "Of n truth, weak woman that I am, I do I lielinve thee. Ill will be tho day for thee, and for mo afo, If it be my fato to learn that I have believed a lie. And now hearken unto tne, O man, w ho hath wandered here from far t o steal my heal t nnd make tne all thine own. I put my band upon thino baud thus, and thus I, whoso lips havo never kirsed lieforo.do kiss thee 011 the brow; and now by m hand, nud by that llrst nnd holy kls, ay, by my Ienp1e's weal nnd by my throuo that llko enough I shall loso for thee, by the uamo of tnv high house, by the sacred stone and by tho tternal majesty of tho Bun, I swear that for thco w ill I live and die.

And after that I really do not know what happened, for I could stand it no longer, nnd cleared oft to refresh myself with a Utile of old society, leaving them to settle it their nnn way, and a very long time fhey wero about it, Somo thnoouarters of an hour afterward tho "pair of doves" came strolling toward us, Curtis looking slightly silly, nnd Kyleplba remarking calmly that the moonlight made very pretty effects on tho marble. Then, for sho was iu a most grnclous mood, sho took my hand nnd said that I was "her lord's" dear friend, und therefore most dear to her not a wonl for my own sake, you sec Next sho liftvd Umslopogaas' ax and examined say lug signillcanlly as sbo did so that ho might soon have causo to uso it in defense of her. After that sho nodded prettily to us all, and casting 0110 tender glanco at her lover, glided off Into the darkness llko a beautiful vision. When wo got back to our quarters, which we did without accident, Curtli asked me, jocularly, what I was thinking about. "lam wondering," I answered, "on what prlnciplo it is arranged that somo peoplo should find beautiful queens to fall in lovo with them, while others And nobody at all, or worse than nobody, and I am also wondering how many brave men's lives this night's work will cost." It was rather nasty of me. pet haps, but somehow all tho feelings do not ovapornto with age, and I could not help being a little jealous ot my old friend's luck. Vanity, my sons, vanity of vanities! On the following morning Good was informed of tho happy occurrence, and positively rippled with smiles that, originating somowhero about the mouth, slowly traveled up his face liko tbo rings in n duck pond, till they flowed over tbo brim of his eyeglass and went whci 0 sweet smiles go. Tho fact of tho matter, however, was that not only wan Good rejoiced about the thing on its own but nlso for personal reasons. Ho adored Soints qulto as earnestly as Sir Henry adored Nyleptha, and bis adoration had not altogether prospered. Indeed, it had seemed to him and to mo also that tbo dark Cleopatra liko queen favored Curtis in her own curious, Inscrutablo way much moro than Good. Thei cforo it was a relief to him to learn that bis unconscious rival was permanently and satisfactory attached in another direction. His faco fell a little, however, when bo was told that tlio wholo thing was to be kept as secret as tho dead, above all from Sorois for the present, inasmuch as tho political convulsion which would follow such an announcement at tho moment would bo altogether too great to face, and would very possibly, if prematurely made, shako Nyleptha from her tbrono. That morning wo again attended in the throuo hnll, mid I could not help smiling to myself when I compared tho visit to our last, ud reflecting that If tho walls could speak they would havo strange tales to tell What actresses women nrol Then, high jpon her golden throne, draped in htrr blazoned "kaf or robo of state, sat tbo fair Nyleptha; und when Sir Henry came 111 a Httlo late, dressed In tbo full uniform of an ofllccr ot her guard, and humbly bent himself before her, she merely acknowledged his salute with n careless noil and turned her head coldly aside. It was a very largo court, for not only did tbo ceremony of the signing of . tho laws attract mniry outsldo of thoso whosu duty it was to attend, but also the lumor that Nasta was going to publicly ask the linml of Nyleptha in marriage had gone broad, with tha result that tbo great boll iras crowded to IU utmost capacity, Thero were our friends tho priests In force, headed cy Agon, who regarded us with a vindictlvo rye; and a most imposing band they were, wilh their long white embroidered robes girt with a golden chain from which hung the flshllko scales. There, too, were n number of the lord, each with a band of brilliantly attired ntU'iiilnuts, mid piomlnent among them was Nastn, stroking his black beard meditatively and looking unusunlly unpleasant. It was a splendid and impresslvo sight, esuecLdlv when tho ofllccr .bavin? read put Men Taw It wus h .ndeu to tbo queens to sign, wbereou tho trumpets blared out and tbo queens' gumil giouuded their S'learswltha criih in salute Tills reading and signing of tbo laws took 11 long time, but at last it camo to an end, tho last 0110 reciting that "whereas certain distinguished strangers, eta," nud to confer 011 tho three of us the rank of "lords," together with certain military commands and large estates bestowed by tbo quovns. When It was read tbo trumpets blared mid the spears 1 lashed down as usual; but I saw somo ot tho lords turn and whisper to each other, while Nasta ground bis teeth. Tlioy did not like tbo favor that was shown to us, which, under all the circumstances, vas not pet haps unnatural Then thero camo a pause, and Nasta stepped forwunl, and bowing humbly, though with no humility in his eyo, craved a boon at tbo bands of the Queen Nyleptha. Nyleptha turned a little palo, but bowed graciously, and prayed the "well beloved lord" to speak on, wbereou in a few straight I forward, soldier like words ho asked her band in marriage Then, lieforo sho could And wonls to answer, tho High Priest Agon took up the tale, and In a speech of renl eloquence and power pointed out the many advantages of tho proposed alliance bow it would consolidate the kingdom; for Nasta's dominions, of which ho was virtually king, were to much what Scotland used to bo to England; how it would gratify tho wild mountaineers nnd bo popular among tho for Nastn was a famous general ; how It would set her dynasty (Irmly 011 tho throne, and would gain tho blessing nnd approval of tho "Sun," I. p., of the ofllce of high priest, and so on. Many of his arguments wero undoubtedly valid; and there was, looking at it from n.iolitical point of view, everything to bo said for tlio marriage. But, unfortunately, it Is difficult to play tho ganio of politics with tho ertoiis of young nnd lovely quccm ns though they wero ivory effigies of themselves on a chess board. Nyleptba's face, whllo Agon siioutcd away, was n perfect study; she smiled, indeed, hut beneath tho smilo it set like n stone, and her eyes began to flash ominously. At last he stopped, and sho prepared herself to answer. Boforo she did so, however, Sornis leaned toward her and said, In n volco sufficiently loud for me to catch w hat sho said, "Bethink thee well, ray sister, cro thou dost speak, for methlnks that our thrones may hang upon tby words." Nyleptha mado no answer, and with a shrug and n smite, Sorals leaned back again and listened. "Of a truth a great honor has been done to me," she said, "that my poor band should not only bavo been asked in marriage, but that Agon hero should bo so swift to pronounce tbo blessing of tho Sun ujiou my union. that iu (mother minute ho would havo wed us fast ere the bride had said her say. Nasta, I thank tbeo, and I will bethink me of thy wonls, but now as yet I bavo no mind for marriage; that Is a cup of which none know the taste until thej' begin to drink it. Again I thank thee, Nasta," and she mado as though she would rise. Tho gieat lord's face turned almost as black as bis beard with fury, .for be know-that tho words amounted to a final refusal of his suit. "Thanks bo to the queen for her gracious words," bo said, rest raining himself with difficulty and looking anything but grateful, "my heart shall surely treasure them. And now I cravo another boon, namely, tho royal leavo to withdraw myself to my own poor cities in tho north until such tlmo as tho queen shall say my suit naj' or J ea. Mayhap," he added, with a sneer, "tho queen will bo pleased to visit ma there, nnd to bring with her tbeso stranger lords," nnd ho scowled darkly toward us. "It Is hut a poor country and a rough, but wo aro a hardy race ot mountaineers, and thero shall bo gathered 30,000 swordsmen to shout a to her." This 6eecli, which was almost a declaration of rebellion, was recoived in complete silence, but Nyleptha (lushed up and answered it with spirit, "Ob, surely, Nasta, I will come, and tho strange loids In my train, and for every man ot thy mountaineers who calls tbeo princo will I two from tho lowlands who call mo queen, ain.Vre will see which Is tho stanchest breed, lit. (hen farewell." Tho trumpets blured out, the queens rose, nnd tho gi eat assembly broko up In murmuring confusion, and for myself I went homo with a heavy heart, foreseeing civil war. After this there was quiet for a few weeks. Curtis and tho queen did not often most, and exercised the utivost caution not to allow the truo relation lu wtiich they stood to each other to leak out; btt, do what they would, rumors as bard to trace as a buzzing fly in a dark room, and yet quite as audible, began to hum round nud round, nud at last to settle on her throne. CHAPTER XVII. THE BTORM BREAKS. And now It was that tho troublo which at first had lftcn hut a cloud as large as a man's band began to loom very black and big upon our horizon, namely, Sorals preference for Sir Henry. I saw tbo storm drawing nearer and nearer; and so, poor fellow, did be. The affection of so lovely and highly placed a woman was not a thing that could In a general way bo considered a calamity by any man; but, situated ns Curtis was, it was a grievous burden to bear. To begin with, Nyleptha, though altogether charming, was, it must bo admitted, of a rather jealous disposition, and was somewhat opt to visit on her lover's head ber indignation at tho marks of what Alphonse would have called the "distinguished consideration" with which her royal sister favored him. Then tho enforced secrecy of bis relations to Nyleptha prevented Curtis from taking some opportunity of putting a stop, or trying to put a stop, to this falso condition of affaiis, by telling Sorals, in a casual but confidential way, that he was going to marry her sister. A third sting lu Sir Henry's honey was that ho knew that Good was honestly ami sincerely attached to tbo ominous looking, but most attractive, Lady of the Night, Indeed, poor Bougwnu was wasting himself to a shadow of his fat and jolly self about ber, his faco getting so thiii that his eyeglass would scarcely stick in it; while she, with a sort of careless coquetry, just gavo him encouragement enough to keep him going, thinking, 110 doubt, that ho might houseful as a stalking horse. I tried to givo him a hint, in as delicate a way as X could, but ho flew into a huff and would not listen to mo; so I d"termlned to let ill alone, tor fear ot making it worso. PoorGoodlbo really was very ludicrous in his distress, nnd went in for all sorts of absurdities, under the belief that ho was advancing his suit. Ono ot them was tbo writing with tho assistance of ono of tbo grave ami reverend seigniors who instructed us, and who, whatever may bavo been tho measure of bis erudition, did not understand how to scan a line of a most intermliiablo lovo song, of which tho continually recurring refrain was something about "I will kiss thee; oh yes, I will kiss theel" Now among the it is a common mid most harmless thing for young men to serenade ladles at night, as 1 believe they do in tbo southern countries of Europe, and sing all sorts ot nonsensical songs to them. Availing himself of this custom, Good him that ho would serenade Sorals, whose private apartments, together with those ot her maidens, were exactly opposite I our own, 011 tho farther el Jo of a nariow courtyard which divided one section of tha great palace from another, Acconllngly, having annul himself with a native zither, on which, being an adopt with the light guitar, ho had easily learned to strum, be proceeded at midnight the fashlonahlo hour for this sort of cuUrnuutlng ton.ako night hldoous with his timorous yells. I wns fast a leep when they begun, but they soon woko mo up for Gcod ios.sees n tremendous voice and has no notion of time and I run to my window place to see what was tho matter. And there, standing in tho full moonlight in tho court yard, I erceired Good, adorned with an enormous o.trlch feather headdress and a flowing silken cloak, which It is tbo right thing to wear upon these occasions, and shouting out tho nbomlua bio song which he mid the old gentleman bad evolved, to a jerky, jingling accompaniment. From tbo direction of the quarters of the maids ot honor came a succession of faint snlggerlugs; but the apartmeuU of Sorait herself whom I devoutly pitied If sho happened to be there wore silent as the grave. There was absolutely no end to that awful song, with Its eternal "I will kiss theel" and at last nolther I nor Sir Henry, whom I hud summoned to enjoy the sight, could stand it any longer; so, remembering the dear old story, I put my bead to tho window opening and shouted, "For Heaven's sake, Good, don't go on talking about it, but kiss her and let's all go to sleep l" Thut chocked him off, and wolind 110 moro serenading. Tbo wholo thing formed n laughable In a tragic business. Well, tlio more Sir Henry held off tho mora Sorals camo on, n.s Is not uncommon in such coses, till at lost things got very queer indeed. Evidently she was, by somo strange pervorslty of mind, quite blinded to the true state of tbo enso; nnd I, for one, greatly dreaded tho moment of ber awakening. Sorals was a dangerous woman to bo mixed up with, either with or without one's own consent. At last tbo evil moment camo, as I saw it must come. One (hie day, Good having gono out hawking, Sir Henry mid I were sitting quietly miking over tho situation, especially with reference to Hornis, when a court messenger nt rived with a written note, which wo with some difficulty deciphered! mid which wns to tho effect that "tho Queen Sorals commanded tho attendance of the Lord Incuhu In her piivate apartments, whither ho would bo conducted by the bearer." "On my wonll" groaned Sir Henry. "Can't you go Instead, old fellow!" "Not If I know It," I said with vigor. "1 had rattier faco a wounded elephant with a shot gun. Wash up own dirty dishes, my boy. If you will bo so fascinating you must tako the consequences. Ain't you just in for it now, that's all r" "You remind mo of when 1 was going to bo (logged at school and the other boj's came to console me," ho said, gloomily. "What right has this confounded queen to command my attendance, I should like to know! I won't go." "But you must; you aro ono of her officers and bound to oboy her, and she knows it. And after all it will soon bo over." "That's just what they used to say," he sold again. "I only hopo sho won't put a knlfo into mo. I believe that she is quite capablo of It." And off he started very faintheartedly, and no wonder. I sat and waited, and at tho end of about f minutes he returned, looking a good deal worse than when he went. "Give ma something to drink," he said hoarsely. I got him a cup of wino, and asked what was the matter. "What is tho matter? Why, if ever there was troublo there's trouble now. You know when I left youi Well, I was shown straight into Sorais' private chamber, and a wonderful place it is; nnd there she sat, quite alone, uion a silken couch at the end ot the room, playing gently upon that zither of hers, f stood before her, and for a whllo sho took no notice of me, but kept on playing and singing a little, and very sweet music it was. At last sho looked up and smiled. " 'So thou art come" eho said. 'I thought that perchance thou hadst gone about the Queen Nyleptba's business. Thou art ever on her business, and I doubt not a good servant nnd a true.' "To this I merely cowed and satdlwai thero to rocelvo the queen's word. u 'Ah, yes. I would talk with thee, but be thou seated. I cannot lift my neck so high,' and she made room for me beside ber on the coucb, placing herself with her back against tuo cnu, so as to nave a view of my face. " 'It is not meet,' I said, 'that I should make myself equal with tbo queen.' " 'I said be seated,' was her answer; so I sal down, and sho set to work to look at me with those dark eyes of hers. There she sat, like an incarnate spirit of beauty, hardly talking at all, and when she did, very low, but all the while looking at tne. There was a white flower In her black hair, and I tried to keep my eyes on it and count the petals, but it was of no use. At last, whether it was ber gaze, or the perfume on ber hair, or what I do not know, but I began to .feel as though I was being mesmerized. At but sho roused herself. " 'Incubu,' sho said, 'lovest thou power r "I replied that I supposed all men loved power of one sort or another. " Thou shalt have It,' she said. 'Lovest thou wealth P "I said I liked wealth for what Jt brought " 'Thou shalt have it,' she said. 'And lovest thou beauty T "To this I replied that I was very fond of statuary and architecture, or something of that soi t, at which she frowned, and there was a pause. By this time my nerves were on such n stretch that I was shaking like a leaf. I know that something awful was going to happen, but she held me under a kind of spell, nnd I could not help myself, u 'Incubu,' she said at length 'wouldst thou bo a Ling? Listen, wouldst thou bo a king! Behold, stranger, I am minded to make thee king ot all and husband of Sorais ot tho Night. Nay, peoco, and hear me. To no man among my people hod I thus opened out my secret heart, hut thou art an outlander, and therefore do I speak without shame, knowing all I have to offer and how hard it had been to theo to ask. See, a crown lies at thy feet, ray lord Incubu, and with that foituuo a woman whom some have wished to woo. Now mayst thou answer.' " 'Oh, Sorals,' I said, 'pray do not speak thus' you see I had nottimoto pick am choose my words 'became aro putting us both in an aw kward position. I am going to marry your sister Nyleptha, Sorais, and I love her.' "Next moment it struck me that I had said mi awful thing, and I looked up to see the results. When I spoke, Sorals' faco was bidden In her hands, and as my words reached ber she slowly raised it, and I shrank back dismayed. It was ashy white, and ber eyes were flaming. She got on to ber feet and seemed to be choking, but tho awful thing was that sho wns so quiet about it all Once sho looked at a sldo table on which lay a aud from It to me, as though she thought of killing mo; but sbo did not take it up. At last sho spoko ono word, and one only "'Gol' "And I went, and glad enough I was to get ut cf It, aud here I am. Givo mo another cup ot wine, there's a good fellow, and tell mo what is to bo done." I shooic my head, for the affair was indeed sorlous. An 0110 of tho poets says, He' I hath no fury llko a woman scorned, moroeipeclully if tho woman is aquoen and a Sorals, mid indeed I feared the very worst, including I in 111 incut danger to ourselves. "Nyleptha must bo told of all this nt once," I said, "nnd perhaps I had better tell her; sho might recclvo your account with suspicion. Who Is captain ot her guard tonight?" "Good." "Very well, then, there will bo no chanco of ber lielug got at. Don't look surprised. I don't think thut her sUter would stick at that, I suppose 0110 must tell Good of what has happened." "Oh, I don't know," said Sir Henry. "It would hurt bis feelings, poor fellow! You see, ho takes n lively personal interest in Bornls." "That's true; nud after all peibaps thero is 110 need to tell him. Ho will And out tbo truth soon enough. Now, you mark my words: Sorais will throw in her lot with Nasta, who is sulking up in the north thero, and there will be such a war as has not lioen known in for centuries. Look there!" and I pointed to twocouit messengers who wero speeding away from tho door of Bornls' pilvato apartments, "Now follow me," and 1 1 nn up a stairway Into an outlook tower that rose from the loot of our quarters, taking tho spy glass with me, ami looked out over tho palace wall Tho first thing we saw was one of tho messengers speeding towards tho temple, bearing, without doubt, tbo' queen's wonl to tho High Priest Agon, but for tho other I searched In vain. Presently, however, I spied a horseman rushing furiously through the northern gate ot tho city, and in him I recognized the other messenger. "Ah I" I said, "Surals is a woman of spirit. Bho is acting at once, and will striko quick and hard. You have Insulted her, my boy, and blood will flow in rivers before the stain la washed away, aud yours with it It she can s s get hold of you. well, I'm olt to Nyleptha. Just stop where you lire, old fellow, and try to get your norves straight again. You'll need them all, I can tell you, unless I have observed human nature in the rough for flf ty years for nothing." And off I went accordingly. (CONTINUEO NEXT WEEK.) THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. A few Extracts Upon Salient Points. FUNCTION OK THE TREASURY. Wben we consider that the theory of our Institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of bin Industry and enterprise, wllh only such deduction as may be his share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the Government which protects him, It la plain that (he exaction of more than this Is indefensible-extortion, and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice. This wrong Indicted upon those who bear the burden of national taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil consequences. The public Treasury, which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people's tribute to Its legitimate objects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding place for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and the people's use, thus crippling our natloual energies, suspending our country's development, preventing Investment In productive enterprise, threatening financial disturbance, and Inviting schemes of public plunder. THE 

RESPONSIBILITY. I have deemed It my duty to bring to the knowledge ol my countrymen.an well as to the attention of their repre sentatives charged with responsibili ty of legislative relief, the gravity of our financial situation. The failure of the Congress heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident the very nature of the dlfllculty must necessarily produce, caused a condition of financial distress and apprehension since your last adjournment which taxed to the utmost all the authority and expedients within executive control, and these appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued Inaction of Congress, the responsibility must rest where it belongs. Though the situation, thus far considered, Is fraught with danger which should be fully realized, and though it preseuts fea'.ures of wrong to the people as well as peril to the country, It is but a result growing out of a perfectly palpable aud apparent cause, constantly reproducing the same alarm ing circumstances a conjested national treasury and depleted monetary condition in the business of the cauutry, It need hardly be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy we can only be saved from alike predicament In the future by the removal of its cause. 

WHERE IT GOES Our present tariff laws, the vicious, Inequitable, and Illogical source of unnecessary taxation, ought, to be at once revised and amended. These laws, as their primary and plain effect, raise Hie price to consumers of all articles Imported and subject to duty, by precisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus the amouut of duty measures the tax paid by those who purchase for use these Imported articles. Many of these things, however, are raised or manufactured in our own couutry, and the duties now levied Uon foreign goods aud products ure called protection to these home manufacturers, because they render it possible for those of our people who are mauufacturers to make these taxed articles aud sell them at a price equal to that demanded for the Imported goods that have paid customs duty, Bo It happens that while comparatively a few use. tne Imported arti cles, millions of our people, who never use aud never saw any of the foreign products, puichase and use things of the same kind made In Ibis country, aud pay therefor nearly or quite the same enhanced price which the duty adds to the Imported articles. Those who buy Imports pay the duty charged thereou Into the public treasury, but the great majority ofnur citizens, who buy the domestic articles of the same class, pay a sum at least approximately equul (o this duty to the homo manufacturer. 

NECESSARY FOR REVENUE. It Is not proposed to entirely relieve the country of this taxation. It must be extensively continued as the source of the Government Income; aud In a readjustment of our tariflTthe Interests of American labor eugaged lu manufacture e hould be carfully considered, as well as the preservation of our It may be called protection, or by any other name, but relief from the hardships aud dangers of our pres eut turliriuwH should be devised with especial precaution against Imperiling the existence of our manufacturing Interests. aRAIIUAL REDUCTION. Out the reduction of taxation demanded should be so measured as not to necessitate or Justify either the loss of employment hy the worklug man nor the lestenlng of his wages; aud the profits still remaining to the manufac turer, ufter a necessary readjustment, should furnish uo excuse lor the sucn lice of the Interests of his employes either In their opportunity to work or. iu the diminution of their compeni tlon, Nor cau the worker In wV lures fall to understand that high Urlff'ls claimed to be allow the payment nf B wages It cerUlnlj ,,,,,. large iuorease lo.

He receives at the desk of his employer his wages, aud perhaps before he reaches his home Is obliged In a purchase for family use of an article which embraces bis own labor, to return In the payment of the Increase in price which the tariff permits, the hard-earned compensation of many days of toll. DIFFICULT. The difficulty attending a and fair revision of our tariff laws la not under-estimated. It will require on the part of (be Congress great labor and care, aud especially a broad and natloual contemplation of the subject, and a patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unreasonable and reckless of the welfare of the entire country. A CONDITION. Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be Improved by dwelling upon the theories of protection aud free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets. It Is a condition which confronts us not a theory. Relief from this condition may Involve a slight reduction or the advantages which we award our home productions, but the entire withdrawal of such ad vantages should not be contemplated. The question of free trade Is absolutely Irrelevant, and the persistent claim made In certain quarters.thatall efforts to relieve the people from unjust aud unnecessary taxation are schemes of so-called free-traders, is mischievous and far removed from any consideration for the public good. The simple and plain duty which we owe the peo ple Is to reduce the taxation to the nec essary expenses of an economical operation of the Government, and to restore to the business of the country the money which we hold in the Treasury through the perversion of governmental powers. These things cau and should be done with safety to all our danger to the opportunity for remunerative labor which our working men need, aud with benefit to them and all our people, by cheapening their means of all subsistence and Increasing the measure of their com- forts. Comments on the Message. New York World. The admirable message of the President has given to the Democratic party what it has long lacked an Issue and a leader. The Issued Is tax reform. The leader Is the Presideut. New York Times. Mr. Cleveland his done an act of statesmanship in the best sense. Recognizing a great duty.he has performed -it with courage, with firmness and at the right time. And he has performed it so that every honest man must see that It is an honest act. .. New York Sun. It Is not a commonplace document, for It Is simple, Intelligible and coher ent, and the quality of brevity is chief ly due to the fact that all other topics of national interest are dismissed Inn lump or postpoued as Inconsequential In the presence of one problem of supreme importance, the question of tariff revision. Courier-Journal. The message of the Presideut, which was sent to Congress to-day takes the breath out of official veterans, who think that such a document should be Infinite In length and universal In detail. It Is, ou the contrary, very short, very much to the purpose and treats only one single question of national Interest. That Is, of course the tariff. Thus, at least, the issue which the timid have been trying to evade, and the corrupt to suppress, has arrived at the front, taking precedence of all other Issues. The politicians cau no longer confuse It. The people can no longer be cheated. The Democratic parly stands upon its natural lines of and attack, with the banuerof Revenue Reform fully unfurled aud its proper chief In the saddle. London Times. No message ou record Is more remarkable for a bold, outspoken disclosure of a novel policy, hitherto opposed or ignored by both political parties. It Is still more remarkable that Mr. Cleveland has the courage to confront the serried phalanx of protectionists on the eve of a contest for the Presidency. 80 far as England is concerned, it Is questionable, whatever the Impulse there nioval of the burdens ou American Industry, whether America will not confront us In forelgu industry, whether America will not confront us luformldable rivalry lu both home and foreigu markets.
