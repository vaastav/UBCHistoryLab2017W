The other colleges that had exhibits at the show were very much impressed with the' suc­ cess our college had in capturing prizes, considering the number of animals shown by the college and the fact that at was the first exhibit made by the college. The steer "Bob" 'brought the most glory to the college by winning first prize as a two year old grade short­ horn steer and the .prize as the champion grade short-horn of the show. He also won second prize in a class, against two year old grades of all breeds. "Bob" was bred on the farm of Col. J. B. Power but has been in the possession of the college ever since calfhood when Professor Hichards recognized in him the mak­ ing of an international candidate. The feeding of "Bob" ihas "been directly in charge of Mr. tLanxon, one of our students, and it is gratifying to the college that our students as a' result of their training are capable of per­ forming tasks of this nature. with such credit. The result of the prizes won at the show demonstrate that North Dakota is capable of breeding and feeding as successfully as it can be done in any state of the union. When we consider that on an avexs •age 75,000 to 80,000 .people visited the show daily, there is no doubt but that many people were more impressed with the possibilities in (North Dakota than they were before looking over the college exhibit.

Pierce, president of the Waters Pierce Oil Co., that in so doing he had never considered that it was anything that the people of Texas would object to. "Why, I have borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars from Pierce," he said, "and I tottd people time and time again when the Tennessee bank­ ruptcy cases were being talked about that 'I not only had that transaction but many others with Pierce. "I once went to him to borrow $156,000. I knew of some securities I could 'buy by which I could make a few thousand dollars. Pierce told me that he did not have that amount of money at hand, but went out to a bank and went my security. "I paid the money back to Pierce and I made several thousand dollars oil the deal. ,. v. *"£he attorney general's office did not need to go to the records of Pierce's office to know that I had bor­ rowed money from him. I could have told them that." 1 railroads would not he able to provide the seed specials this winter on ac­ count of the Item of expense and that the "Soo" was as yet undecided but feared that the interstate commerce law would prevent, theW providing their accustomed train.
