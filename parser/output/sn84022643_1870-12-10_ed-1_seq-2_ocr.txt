V. 3. Official Paper for Oregon. SATURDAY, DECEMliKR 10, 1870. niiV. T. 8. KKSiOAI.l,. Oar lathers, Where are .thej? and oar prophets, do they live forever ?" One of Oregon's most distinguished citizens has gone from the walks of men fallen ma one of the majestic firs amidst the stillness of the forest. All that was mortal of Thomas Simpson Kendall is dead, bat he has left tho impress of his mind upon all those among whom he moved. Dr. Kendall was great wore in .what he was, than in what he did. lie might bare .risen to distinction in almost any of the walks f life, but he chose instead an humble sphere. With him there were do distinctions of persons. The pessant was the equal of the prince, and the nater,of the slave. Socially he knew no difference. Ilis nature was eminently genial, and his colloqual powers good. These, with bis almost universal store of general knowledge, and his sinsular freedom from anything like ostentation, rendered him one of the most compan ionable of friends. , But it was on the rostrum that he ap peared to the best advantage. Tall, straight, and commanding in person, whenever occasion occurred to wake the latent fires of his nature, he arose to the full measure of the genuine orator. In argument he was overwhelming, and often indulged in most impassioned elo quence. Dr. Kendall was one of the early pioneers of Oregon, and has been identi fied with her interests for more than twenty-five years. lie assisted in mold ing her institutions, and laying the foundation of our present and prospective prosperity. As a patriot, his devotion to country never faltered, even amid the darkest hours of her trial ; but then, as in his early manhood, his voice was ever beard in defense of the eternal principles of justice and the inalienable rights of man. But he has gone, his face no more, cheerful greetings, ber him as he was. ory. We shall look upon We shall miss his But we will remem Pcace to his mem- pletlon of the o. 4c C Railroad to Albany. The 8th day cf December, A. D. 1870, will ever be remembered as the most eventful in the history of tbo city of Al bany. On that day the track of the Ore gon & California Railroad was completed to her doors, and the snort of the iron horse was heard within her precincts. Hundreds, of our citizens, many of whom had yet to see the first train of car or an iron rail, assembled on the depot grounds in the Southern suburbs of the city, long ere the train was announced to arrive, waiting anxiously but patiently the arrival of the first passenger train to Albany. Ben Ilolladay telegraphed to our Mayor on Wednesday night that he would be at the Albany depot by half past twelve P. M., but owing to some de lays, and the tact that the track was not layed a sufficient distance beyond the depot to make room for the construction train, then on the track, until about 2 o'clock, the train did not arrive until that time. A Reception Committee, the City Council, city and county officers, firemen, and a large concourse of our eitixens, headed by the Albany Brass Band, and Marshaled by City Recorder, A. N. Arnold, bad formed in pro cession at tho Court House, and marched out to the grounds, were in readiness to receive Ben Holladay and guests, and tender them the hospitalities of our city. Dr. E. R. Geary, Chairman of the Re ception Committee, upon the arrival of the can, introduced Mr. Ilolladay to Mayor Stanard, . who, in a neat little speech, presented to hint in behalf of our citizens, for tbe use of the locomotive Albany, a beautiful flag. Mr. Ilolladay received the flag, and introduced Hon. J. H. Mitchell, of Portland, who delivered a neat speech just fitting the occasion. This was followed by the presentation of a flag, gotten up by the ladies for the locomotive J. B- Stephen, which has done all the hard" work, hauling construc tion trains, eto., on the road. - It was the flag of the occasion, and . was pre' tented by Mrs. A. J. Duniway, ia a few well-chosen and elegant words. Dr. Loryea was. sent to the front, and made one of his happy, mirth-provoking speeches. Miss Ada . Mendenhall then presented three beautiful signal flags, gotten tip ia the most tasteful manner, in s speech which done the little lady great credit. Judge Mitchell responded, eonf pfimentrbs: Miss Ada highly for her taste and spirit. This was followed by a speeoh from a military gentleman, whose aatne we did not learn. Then came speeches from Mr. Caplci, o f Portland, humourous and patrioti o ; one from Ben. Harden,, ft "West-Sider," only such as Ben. could make; another from W. C. Johnson, Escj., of Oregon City; a few appropriate raoiarks were made by Luth "er Elkias, E, of this eitr. and oroba- Wy one or two others, whose names have soaped our memory. There were some two or threo hundred gentlemen on the are, fa of Mr. Hoi La 4 y, repress tativo men of Salem, Oiegou City and Portlard. About 4 o'clock P. M. the i "toot" of the locomotive warned all that the train was about to start, and soon after the locomotive Allan, .with her five car loads of precious freight, started on her return trip. Thus, despite all prophecies, drawbacks aod mishaps, which had to be met in the undertaking of so great an enterprise, we are pleased to be able to chronicle this morning tho fact that Albany is now a real, live, railroad town. Eastern News. Congress convened on the Cth. The President's message was received and read in the House, and greeted with great applause. We shall probably be able to lay the message be fore our readers next week. Matters in France are progressing about as usual. The French government claim great sue cesses in the recent battles before Paris. On the other hand Minister Washburn's Steretary writes from Paris that the French have been beaten at all points but one, and the end is near at hand. Man Shot. Ou Thursday night two railroad men got into a rouh-and tumble fiht in the bar-room of the St. Charles a third party, Mr. C. G. Smith, caught hold of one of the parties and attempted to pull him away from the other, both being on the floor at ' the time. During tho scuffle, a pistol in tho pocket of one of the. fightengors exploded, the shot taking effect in the left lex of Mr. Smith, just above the knee. It is reported that the physicians at tending, Dtp. Rice and Alexander, thought the bone had been crushed by the ball, and amputation of the limb would be necessary. Commercial. We notice no mate rial change in the San Francisco market quotations. Albany dealers are paying 80c for wheat. Wheat is quoted in Salem at 85c ; in Portland at 95e(i81. There are no evidences of a further advance just yet, nor, so far as we can see, is there any indications that the article will fall below present quotations immediately. The war between France and Prussia shows no signs of abatement, and its con tinuance will doubtles keep prices up to the presenc figures. From present indi cations there will be no general E uropeau war, and no general advance in prices need be looked for from this cause. Salem.- The Salem municipal elec tion on last Monday resulted as follows : The Republicans elected their Mayor, Recorder, Marshal and Treasurer, and four Councilmcn ; the Democrats elected four Councilmcn. This latter result was as great a surprise to Democrats as Repub licans, and could have been avoided had the Republicans apprehended any such result. Silver-ton. Eleven of the Bullen family, living near Silverton, Marion county, have had the smalt pox, seven of whom died, five of them within seven days... The family of T. M. Davenport are all about again, and of the four in the family of Joseph Davenport taken with tho disease, all are said to be im proving. So says the Salem Statesman. Mrs. Annnie M. Hard, of Port Lud low, (W. T.) has been appointed Inspec tor of Customs, and will travel on one of the boats running between Victoria and Olympia. Telegraphic Summary. Washington Dec. 6. The Presi dent's Message to the United States Sen ate and House of Reuresentatives in Congress assembled, opened by announc ing a jear of peace and prosperity as having passed since the last assembling of Congress. It is a comparatively brief document, written in a clear business like way, which presents at a glance a review of public affairs for the past year, and tl.e present situaiiou of the country. The main facts stated are already famil iar to the public through the papers. In reference to the Alabama question the President says: '"I regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for an adjustment of the claims against Great Britain, growing out of tho course adopted by that Government durinz the rebellion. The Cabinet of London, so tar as its views have been expressed, does not appear to be willing to concede that ber Majesty's government was guilty of neglect, or did any act during the war by which the United States has any just cause ot complaint. Uur arm and unal terable convictions are directly the reverse. 1 therefore recommend to Congress to authorize the appointment of Commis sioners to take proof of the amounts and ownership of vessels, and 'their claims, and that authority be given for a settle meat of those claims by the United States, so that this government shall have ownership of all private claims, as well as responsible control of all demands against Great Britain, and whenever her Majesty's government shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of tho claims, the United States govern ment will enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire lor a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both nations. Raleigh, N. C, Dec. 3. The Demo- cats in the Assembly are debating reg ularly about impeaching Governor J tr oer. , Washington, Dec. 3.- Congressmen are arriving rapidly. There will oortain It be a quorum on Monday. M. Treil-hard has received his creden tials. ;; M. Berthenay departs for f fifca on Monday. . Cbicaoo, . Dee. 3. The Journal $ Washington special says that Senator Spencer,' of - Alabama, who has just srriTed, ssys tae Denoerats will elect s Senator from that State to succeed Warner. The question as to when the Pacific Railroads are bound to pay interest on bonds loaned to them by the Government, is still betore the Attorney General, and will not be decided for some time. It involves difficult questions at law. The roads, through their attorneys, claim that by the provisions of the law interest is to be paid, one-half in transportation money, and five pe r cent, of the net earnings, and whatever remains is not due until the bonds mature. Salt Lake. Dec. 3. A few davs since E. F. Tracy, agent of Wells, Fargo & Co., in this city, received a dispatch irom Allto, devastating that two law yers, named Bonnifield and Rand, of lko, said to be counsel tor Dan. Taylor, one of the C. P. R. R. robbers, had after consultation with Taylor, suddenly left for the East. Tracy nli-ced the matter in the hands of the police here, and he had a detective on the track, who, soon as Ronnifield and Rand arrived here on the train, followed them west of this city to near where Taylor was captured, and arrested them in the act of digging up the- stolen treasure, amounting to S3, 000 in greenbacks, and 45 ounces in gold dust, which was taken from them, and in digging down further, found 8300 in coin. The prisoners are now in cus tody. They say Taylor told them where the treasure was hidden, and to a.ct. as his counsel. " London, Pec. 3. A telegram, dated Tours, December, 2d, says, it is officially stated to night that one or two days must elapye before the fruits of the movements now in progress may be lully reaped. Up to this time successive steps have been taken and every moment brings nearer to each other -the armies of the Loire and of Paris. During the fighting on the 30th Ducrot and Vinoy captured four Prussian guns and mauy prisoners. Advices from Paris to November30ih, state that an order has been issued to the press to the effect that military move ments and particulars, not sanctioned by the Government officials, are not to be published, on pain of suppression. The military authorities have made public the following details of recent events around the city : On the 28th, at day breuk, a cannonade opened from the forts on the south of the city. Next day Generals Vinoy, Buzenval nud Dcspreau made their way out ot the fortifications, on a rcconnoissance south of L' Hay and ; Choissey Lo Roi. They attacked the positions of the Prussians, and also dislodged them at Grauvillers. Their loss was severe.

V inoy had positions greatly in advance of Ducrot. The latter stopped, owing to a sudden rise iu the river, brought about by the Prussians breaking away the dam, and not on account ot any resistance offered. The Prussians retook Chanipaigne, but the French again took it. The 1'russiaus, and not the French demanded a truce to bury their dead. The Army of the Loire made a success ful forward movement. All the rail ways iii this part of the country have ceased temporarily to take passengers, owning to the cuormous movements of troops. i London, Dec. d.

He deplored this as adding fresh difficulty to the Alabama embroglio. cited his American experience, and de scribed the sentiments of Americans on these questions.

At Birmingham, last evening, a large meeting was addressed by Harold, Vicar of St. Peters, Rogers, Jacob and others. Resolutions in favor of a peace Congress were adopted.
