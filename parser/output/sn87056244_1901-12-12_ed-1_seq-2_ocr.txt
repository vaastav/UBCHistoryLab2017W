THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE AXATICIIY. A grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist pcsition was afforded bv the attitude of the law toward m this very criminal who had just taken the life of the president. The people would have torn him limb from limb if it had not teen that the law he de fied was at once invoked in his behalf. So far from his deed being committed on behalf of the peopie against the government, the government was obliged at once to exert its full police power to save him from instant death at the hands of the people. Moreover, his deed worked not the slightest dislocation in our govern mental system, and the danger of a recurrence of such deeds, no matter how great it might grow, would work only in the direction of strengthening and giving harshness to the forces of order. o manwill ever be restrain ed from becoming president by any fear as to his personal safety. If the risk to the president's life became great, it would mean that the office' would more and more irae to be rilled by men of a spirit which would make them resolute and merciless in deal ing with every friend of disorder. This gi eat country will not fall In to anarchy, and if anarchists should j ever become a serious menace to institutions, they would not merely be stamped out, but would involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their doctrines. The American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame. Prosperity. During the last five years business confidence has been restored, and the nation is to be congratulated because of its present abounding prosperity. Such prosperity can never be created by law alone, although it is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. If the hand of the Lord is heavy upon any country, if Hood or drought comes, human wisdom is powerless to avert the calamity. Moreover, no law can guard us against the consequences of our own folly. The men who are idle or . credulous, the men who seek pains not by gen uine work with head or hand but by gambling, in any form, are always a source of menace not only to them selves but to others. If the business world loses its head, it loses what legislation cannot supply. Fundamentally the welfare of each citizen, and therefore the welfare of the aggregate of civizens which makes the nation, must rest upon individual thrift and energy, resolution and in tellegince. Nothing can take the place of this individual capacity; but wise legislation and honest and intel ligent administration can give it the fullest scope, the largest opportunity to work to good effect. THE NEW 

INDIAN. If the Indian is made to labor like other people, and if his tribal rela tions are destroyed as suggested by the - president in his message, then will all the romance and poetry and every unique, characteristic be taken away from the red man and he will be but a common every day plodding citizen. The Indian must come to it, though. This is a practical age that has lit tle to do with traditions and senti ment of the past. Lo must under stand that his brow has got to sweat and he will be obliged to use his strong right arm in daily toil if he cares to live. lie must put away hi3 gun, his scalping knife, his trinkets, his beads, his feathers, his buckskin attire, his blankets, his indolence and his dreams of the - war path, of over coming the white man and re-possesj-ing the land once owned and ruled by his fathers, and go to work. A new Indian is coming upon the scene of action. All of his powers which have ever naturally been of the best, will be developed under the new order of things. He will be thrown upon his individual resources, made to feel that he is a man and all of his manly traits brought to the front. If this had been done long ago instead of keeping the Indian as a national ward to be misused by unscrupulous govern ment agents, and made to think he was nothing but a child constantly needing a parent's care, the .race would have been much better off and the country spared an immense ex pense. The Roosevelt idea that "the Indian should be treated as an in dividual like the white man," is the right one and no time should be lost in making a practical application of the idea in abolishing the agencies, destroying tribal relations and giving tlie Indian an opportunity to rise in the world on his own meiits. In a few years he will never be referred to as Lo, with the untutored mind. South Bend Tribune. 

CONSERVATISM IN PROSPERITY, In the great prosperity of recent years Indiana's golden share of it has been so marked as no longer to occa sion surprise, 'mere was and is so much in Indiana on which to base solid prosperity that favorable trade conditions only were needed to ac count for the large increase in wealth and population that has been the state's happy history in recent years. The phenomenal gas field, which a do zen years ago began to lay the found ations of a new Indiana, is still a source of immense wealth. Succeeding it even too fast is the oil development which promises to add to wealth in the future as gas has added in the past. Happily, Indiana's coal fields, as yet an almost undisturbed source of wealth, are here to supply the scarcity of other kinds of fuel, and in their development to become another source f prosperity. The inexhaust ible stone fields must increase their business with the country's prosperi ty. More than this, the fine clays are coming to their own in a growing ap preciation of their possibilities, while, we are just at the beginning of the development of the Portland cement industry, in which the State promises to take a lead. Meanwhile in all other of the feat ures of a prosperous community, Ind iana is growing mightily. . The exten sion of the free rural delivery system, greater in proportion in this state than in any other, and the multipli cation of inteurban roads become great factors in aiding in the distribu tion, and to a certain extent in the creation Of wealth, With all this ex perience teaches that now is thft time to be conservative. "We' know that prosperous times can not last always. As the secretary of the treasury has pointed out in his report, "it is a familiar fact in the past, and it will be a recurrent fact in the future that unsettling influences come in at unex pected periods to disturb finances and menace credit operations. One or more events occurring in succession or possibly operating together, disturb confidence in the situation";and then the secretary goes on to cite "a mark ed example in the so-called panic of 1893," when within a period of less than twelve months, bank credits were contracted bv more than $400, 000,000. Confessedly in the opinion of bank ers and fianciers as well as bv the' earn est words of the comptroller of the currency and the secretary of the treasury, neither our banks nor our currency system are as easily to en counter these adverse conditions. The secretary, in striking phrase, says, "admirable in many respects, exper ience shows that oar banking system is devised for fair weather, not for storms." So great business interests and small business interests are vital ly concerned in shaping a course that may hold fast if a storm comes, and may avoid the storm as far as possible. There is so much in the present pros perity in Indiana that has the solid est of foundations that we should be short-sighted were we to fail to be as conservative in all ways as possible, to be slow to enter on speculative ven tures, remembering that dull times as well as prosperous times come and may not be stayed, but that those who in the prosperous times have shaped their ventures right and have preserv ed the fruits of them, are they who ean tide over lean years with a mini mum of distress. The people of Indi ana are In a position to illustrate this as they did during the last "hard times." They will show their wis don and self-restraint by following such a course. Indianapolis News.

Left when but a boy to fight his battles practical ly alone, he strove with such diligence and determination as to accomplist adequate rewards for his efforts, at the same time winning the esteem and confidence of all who knew him. He was united in marriage Aug. 3, 1901, with Miss Effie Finney who with a large circle of relatives and a host of sympathising friends is left to moum her sad loss.
