SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS. We are passing through a period of moral and economic reaction that demands a readjust ment of both thinking and doing in order to meet its exaction, and this process is bound to be pain ful.

We know that pessimism weakens and is deadly to every enterprise poisoned by its pre sence; but too much optimism is like too much wine; and is likewise a dangerous indulgence in the presense of serious work. We must realize that a difficult problem lies before us and each must give the best that is in him or her for its solution, or be counted a coward and slacker, says the Bolivar County Commercial. And that means individual effort and self denial on the part of every man and woman, girl and boy in the community; not given grudgingly and reluctantly, hut. bravely, faithfully, and cheer fully. It is an individual duty that cannot be passed on to our neighbor; and as we perform it or shirk it, our place is fixed in our self-respect and the respect of the community, while our character is by the one course or the other strengthened or weakened. The first step to lie taken by the faithful is to quit wasting; pay all that you possibly can on your debts; if you cannot pay the whole ac count, pay it in part, and make no more debts until existing ones are discharged. The old story of the travels of a five dollar hill paying a hun dred accounts and then coming back to its origin al possessor has a fine opportunity for application in this community right now. Sell anything that you can do without and start paying up. Then get down to real work of production or service; one is as necessary and as honorable as the other. Nothing is shameful, but idleness and waste. Economy does not mean parsimony; spend ing is necessary to the economic life of the com munity; self-denial does not mean the renuncia tion of the comforts of life; it means the giving up of joy-rides, unwholesome amusements, fri vols and follies upon which such large sums have been wasted by our people during prosperous days. If we can get together on a program of work are the ed without whining, spending without waste and debt-paying to the limit of our resources, within twelve months we will ail be better off and hap pier, too, than during the recent orgy of extra vagance, from which we are, now, painfully try ing to recover. Arthur Brisbane has the following to say about the war profiteer; "When a thing is abso lutely complete, you may have to admire, al though you may not approve. The rattlesnake needs to bite only once, the scorpion allows her young to fet'd on her living body, the tarantula stings the big bumble bee right back of the brain, paralyzing that large bee forever; the basilisk could kill you with a look, They are all wonder fully thorough, but basilisk, tarantula, scorpion and rattesnake would all take off their hats, if they wore hats, to grafting profiteers that stung Uncle Sam in the war. For instance; An iron hinge was lacking on a door leading to the cook ing department of a ship at Norfolk. The hinge was bought for eighty-three cents. A blacksmith screwed it in place. An assistant blacksmith helped him, master mechanic supervised the job. The Shipping Board received and paid a bill for "material and labor" of $161. William R. Morton, investigator, testifies to this.

Foni every possible viewpoint, Ben Humph reys would adorn the governor's office. He tow ers above the men who have held that office in recent years like a mountain above a mole-hill. In statesmanship .executive ability and exalted principles, Mississippi has produced few men in recent years who are his equal. Up in Washington Ben Humphreys ranks among a relatively few men who have a real in fluence in Congress.

Ben Humphreys is one of this number. • girl be it our can ac If the voters of Mississippi want ernor next time, Ben Humphreys is their man.

BAD TIMES ON THE FARM. Low prices of farm products have put a crimp in the buying power of the farming munities, But experience shows, The Nation's Business declares, that depression in agricultural sections caused by low prices of farm products are not lasting, nor so severe as those in industrial com centers which proceed from lack of manufactur ing activity and consequent unemployment. On the whole the farming community can furnish its own subsistence and can tide itself over bad times. Too, the accumulated supplies, the abundance of which caused the depression are daily diminishing in volume and cannot be replenished until another harvest. Thus the na tural operation of the law of supply and demand tend to remedy the trouble. The cotton-growing South is distressed over the low price of cotton. It is not a new experi ence, however, and the South has always recover ed and gone on to greater prosperity, but it is an acute phase while it lasts. to her or until for ent die row, the were 35 rule bills cluded The hicle er many had -O HIGH SOUNDING TERMS.

She determined right there if her husband was a general auditor she was going to live up to it.

Both Senate and House expect to plunge immediately into work tomor row, organization under republican control having been affected last spring at the first regular session of the present Congress, were organized, except for a few va cancies and enlargement of the House appropriations committee from 21 to 35 members under the new House rule centralizing all appropration bills in the committee. The Senate's unfinished business, pending and awaiting debate, with protracted discussion in prospect, in cluded the Kenyon-Kendrick bills to regulate the meat packers and other adjuncts of the livestock industry. The bill was expected to be the ve hicle for numerous speeches and oth er debate by senators on political events, domestic and foreign, and many other subjects. The house also had many bills waiting on its calend Committees ar. Although all pending bills die when Congress adjourns in March, little general legislation was planned for the present session by leaders. The appropriation bills, originating in the house, were to be given right of way, in the hope of passing all by March and having the decks clear for oth er legislation in the proposed ape cial session of the new Congress next April. Many new bills and resolu tions were ready for introduction, however. With general expectation that wish es of President-elect Harding and other republican leaders would pre vail regarding legislative action dur ing the present session, no immediate move regarding American interna tional relations was contemplated by the republican leaders. There was much speculation today among re turning members of Congress wheth er President Wilson would return the Treaty of Versailles to the Senate. Treaties before the Senate foreign committee, without prospect of early action, were the Polish treaty, the proposed Anglo-American-French pact protection of France and the 1 treaty with Columbia. The Auatrian treaty has not yet been submitted by Preaident Wilaon. Kevenue and taxation questions are to have early consideration of Senate and House leaders and committees, but general sentiment appeared to be 1 for deferring action until after Pres ident Harding's inauguration. Pre Uminary work on bills to revise tariff and internal revenue probably will be started during the present session, i however, to exercise action at the j Continuance of several old and the launching of several new congression- j al investigations also are planned, j The Senate committee investigating i housing conditions and the House I body inquiring into shipping board i affairs are to be continued, accord-1 ing to present plans.

The senate priv ileges and elections committee's in quiry into the Newberry-Ford Sen atorial election contest, in Michigan also is pending, but is not expected to have concluded until after disposi tion of Senator Newberry's appeal to the Supreme Court from his conviction of violating the election laws. Hundreds of nominations, including many appointments ,are to be sent to the Senate soon by President Wilson, but republican leaders declare pri vately that there is little chance of confirmation of many of the appoint ments. Officers nominated will hold over and function, but with the vir tually certain prospect having suc cessors appointed by the new repub lican President and confirmed by the next Senate. The session which began today was the third of the Sixty-sixth Congress. The first, the special session conven ed May 19 and adjourned Nov. 19, 1919, and the second, convening Dec. 1 adjourned last June 5 before the national political conventions. for new session. !

EXPENDITURES ESTIMATED WASHINGTON, Dec. 6-Another peace-time estimate of nearly five bil lions of dollars for the government expenses during the fiscal year 1922 faced congress when it reassembled today. The exact figures, as trans mitted by Secretary Houston, were $4,653,856,769, an increase of nearly one billion dollars over the appropria tions for the current year, but $211, 000,000 less than estimates submit ted a year ago. Continuing war costs were directly reflected throughout the estimates in dicating that the government might be on a four billion dollars basis for some years to come, as compared with the one billion dollar maximum pre ceding the war. The single item of interest on the public debt was al most the pre-war maximum al appro priations, this total being $922,650, 000. In addition there was an esti mate of $265,754,864 for the war debt sinking fund. Of the individual departments the army and navy, as usual, asked for the greatest amounts, the estimate for the military establishment being $699,275,000 and for the navy $658, 522,231. The total estimates as given by Mr. Houston follow: Legislative (congress) $9,324,040; Executive (White House and govern ment departments) $125,448,379; Ju dicial (Supreme Court) $1,680,215; Department of agriculture $41,989, 379; Foreign intercourse $11,983,848; Indian affairs $11,989,703; Pensions $265,190,000; Panama canal $16,187, 256; Public works $250,928,194; Postal service $585,406,902; Miscellaneous $675,154,741 ; Permanent annual ap propriations $1,300,776,361. These estimates, prepared by the Democratic administration are for the operation of the government dur ing the fiscal year of the new Repub lican administration. Republican leaders of the senate and house al ready have forecast a sharp cut in the total and within the week the house committee will begin the work of shaping the bills which will carry the sums for the various departments. The estimate for the postal ser vice will NOT actually figure in gov ernmental expenditures since the pos tal revenues practically cover the cost of operation. "Included in the estimates for the army and navy is a total of $95, 000,0000 for development and main tenance of the air service in the two defensive branches of the govern ment. The navy asks for $85,000, 000 and the army seeks $60,000,000. Chief among the estimates for the navy is one of $184,000,000 to con tinue the 1916 three year building program. Pay for the navy person nel exceeds it by by $923,910. The army's greatest single item is $215,659,830 for the pay and mile age of officers and men. Subsistence costs for the force is estimated at $64,490396. An appropriation of $74, 808,000 is proposed for the national guard.

PRESIDENT RECEIVES COMMIT TEE. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6—President Wilson received the congressional committee appointed to notify him congress was in session, while stand ing the Blue Room. He told the com mittee he would "communicate with" congress tomorrow, but he did not in dicate whether he would address the congress in person. The impression of the committee however, was that the President would not address congress in person. G. W. Strickland Died Here Sunday Morning Mr. G. W.
