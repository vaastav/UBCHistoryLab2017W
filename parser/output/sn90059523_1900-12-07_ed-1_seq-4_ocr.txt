They are equally unreliable. England's foreign commerce, the most immense, as it is the most far reaching, the world^-haa ever known, is, pure and simple, the product of protection. We use the word protection advisedly. It is the most of fensive that can sound in Democratic ears. Protection is today, and has been since responsible legislation was first formulated in England, the great policy of the British empire in regard to'its maritime interests. I Now that England has won through well-considered and liberal national poll cy toward shippers, the virtual control of the world's commerce, what more natural than that she should disaffirm any policy on the part of a commercial rival which might head in the same di rection? She finds quite a clever advocate of this idea in the current number of the j Forum.- It is Mr. Benjamin Taylor, and lie lives, by the way, in Newcastle on-the-Tyne. Mr. Taylor is a bright man. He knows how to state a case in half, to make the better seem the worse and to keep out of sight all facts r. hicta might injuriously affect his case. j Mr. Taylor, very wisely for his cause, [takes up the contributions of Mr. Eu gene Chamberlain, the present commis i Bioner of navigation, to the literature of .the subject and seeks to meet their con tentions. How illy he succeeds is made very plain by his entire article. Let us see how at the outset he avoids the main facts involved in the case at issue. In the early paragraphs of "his article he says: I "The British government does grant what are called mail subsidies to certain steamship companies; and British ship ping and ship building have thriven as the shipping and ship building of no other country have done. But there is jio connection between the two facts, ffhe ogress of British merchant ship ping is in no sense or degree due to the (payment of mail subsidies, which are simply remuneration for cargoes car ii. i. That cargo is postal matter, but | the money paid for the carriage of it is lust as much freight as the money paid foy me: chants for the carriage of Man chester cottons or American Hour. If the iUnited states commissioner of navigation j falls into the error of connecting Brit ish maritime prosperity with mail sub sidies, it is not surprising if the fallacy is pretty current in the United States." This sort of special pica of - confession and avoidance will deceive nobody. It is , bad enough as it stands, but when it is •followed up by matter far less covert ■in its nature and effect, its true nature as a plea is made plainer. _*or instance, in discussing these same subsidies, tho 'amourt of which Mr. Taylor, literally dare not, for the integrity of his argu ment set forth, this advocate of foreign shipping interests says of them: 'They are only attractive indirectly in respect-to the prestige attaching to the night to fly the Royal Mail Hag, and many of these mail steamship owners will confess to you, in the confidence of private intercourse, that the game is not .Worth the candle. They are in it, and they continue in it, as is the custom of all men of commerce, to run in grooves; but they are by- no means the beneficent ly endowed beings that Mr. E. S. Cham berlain's argument may lead the gen feral reader to believe." Why does not Mr. Taylor tell us how little they are endowed? He has every variety of figures to give on different phases of this subject, but not a single ■one to show how much her majesty's government pays for carrying mall ►freight." } But, mi-leading as his position is, he ?would not urge that England has never put forward her national funds to aid !her shipping. He would be -laughed at for the contention. And no student of this question who is anxious to see American shipping develop to reasonable proportions will delude himself for a moment with the belief, after nearly forty, years of experience, that there .can be anything like a spontaneous growth of American foreign shipping. No; •-.either Mr. Taylor's arguments or figures, nor those of any other of the ad vocates of his school, touch the. vital question of how best to promote the for eign shipping of the United States. 

COLONIAL aOVERXMEATS. • From the treatment of the Philippine Question in the president's message it is •fevldent that he hopes, ultimately, to govern those Islands not as colonies, but as United States territory under the con stitution as it now stands. Already are ,the Hawaiian Islands and Porto Rico lUnited States territory, with practically a territorial government. The Philip pines, however, are a harder proposi tion, owing not only -to a state of war, tout to the various degrees of civilization "existing among the inhabitants. The plan of the president for the gov ernment of the islands, while not ex plicit, has the virtue of meeting the pres ie'nt demands. The mingling of civil and military authority Is always a delicate problem, especial so when .any,: portion* ,of .the people to -be governed arc in arms against the proposed authority. .- Government of -the Philippines by the Taft commission and the _military arm of the United States is unique in the-his tory of colonial ; governments. No one will -contend that it is a constitutional government, but there are -some things which must be done without authority, if the authority cannot be found in the constitution.*- The government: of the Philippines at the present time is a war measure—their government under the .constitution, should the - war ' suddenly cease, is an other proposition^^Considering the Ha waiian islands and Porto \ Rico" as colo nial dependencies, the United^ States is still *an infant in colonial possessions. Great Britain. stands first. as a colonizer, then ; comes - France, followed by the Netherlands and Belgium. Germany has 11,000,000 colonial '■ subjects— United States about the same ' China, Russia and Turkey have de pendencies over which a kind of su zerainty is claimed,'but the colonial rela tions as we understand them do not ex ist. 7 At this time the nature of the govern ments adopted for the colonial posses sions of the leading civilized nations is of absorbing interest. Great Britain gov erns her vast colonial population (375, --000,000) under one of three forms. First, colonies having a responsible local gov ernment, in which the crown has only a veto on legislation,-and the home gov ernment controls no' public officer ex cept the governor; second, Colonies pos sessing representative legislative institu tions, with a reserved veto power in the crown, but in which the home govern ment retains control of ail public-, offi cers; third, crown colonies hi which the crown has entire control of legislation, and the administration of public affairs is carried on by the home-government. Of the first class, Canada, the Austra lian confederation,'• _ Cape ; Colony and Newfoundland are . examples. _- The Ber mudas, the Barbadoes and the Bahamas represent the second class. The work ing of the third classes seen in Gibral tar, Hongkong and India. The govern ment of India is under the control of the secretary of state for India, the imme diate authority being vested in a vice roy appointed by 'the crown. The local government is conducted largely by the natives. French Algeria is governed by a governor general appointed by the home government, and is under the con trol, of the-ministry. The. chamber of deputies legislates for the colony, ln Madagascar the same system prevails, except the civil authorities act in con junction with the military forces occu pying the island. . The government of French colonies differs from that of the British in the fact that the colonies send .a senator and two deputies to represent them in the French assembly. These representatives are usually selected by a council. The government of the East India Netherlands' resembles the sec ond class- of "British colonial govern ments. German.colonies are governed directly by the crown. The problem' of governing", the . hetero geneous- millions of the Philippine group to the satisfaction of, not all, but a ma jority, and still keep within the constitu tion, is a delicate proposition. Without a constitutional amendment the only feasible method is to erect, or cause to be erected, territories out of those por tions of the islands having a homogene ous population, capable of understanding the principles of civil government. The president speaks of the Filipinos j as the nation's wards. Just what legal j meaning the word will grow to have re- ! mains to be seen. The greatest difficul ty which will confront us in the assimi lation of this East.lndian territory will not arise in the problems of local gov ernment of the natives, but in the In dustrial complications that will develop, in the United States when the country is thrown open to the influx of the Eastern • hordes. Possibly congress can find a remedy under the "constitution— the president recommends none. THE CLATTtWf-BBLWR
