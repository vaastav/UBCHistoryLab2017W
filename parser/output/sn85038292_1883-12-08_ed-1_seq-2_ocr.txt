£ltc grwomtfc WESTMINSTER, MD. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1883. Position of the Democracy. Those Republicans who were counting upon Democratic blunders in Congress for success next year must feel depressed over the first move of the Democracy. The election of Hon, John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, by so overwhelming a vote, is an aggressive step on a platform of revenue reform. Mr. Carlisle is an able and consistent revenue reformer, ile is not a free-trader, for free trade by the nature of oipj government and the opposition of the people to national direct taxes, is an impossibility; but ho is for reducing the pub lic expenses to the lowest limit consistent with an efficient public service, and the reduction of the taxes to an amount only sufficient for the needs of the government. Just how this will be effected, has not yet been settled, and there is a difference of opinion among Demo crats. Some are for a reduction of the tariff —not a radical change, but a gradual one, the periods of reduction set a considerable time ahead. Others favor an abolition of the in ternal revenue. Mr. Carlisle, himself, favors a revisloujof the tariff, at all events —an equal ization—as the present one is discriminating in its character, and some of its provisions are simply buncombe. We doubt not that under Mr. Carlisle’s leadership a genuine revenue reform, such as the people declared for in 1882, when they changed a Republican ma jority of about twenty in Congress to a Demo cratic majority of seventy-six, will be accom plished—at least the policy of the government will be set in that direction, for it will take some years of gradual approach to bring the government back to the ante-bellum days of economy and frugality. Although Mr. Carlisle has been in Congress but six years, his ability, sincerity and sound tariff and financial views have given him a national reputation. He has always been outspoken on revenue reform, and his large vole shows that the country accords with his views. To his one hundred and six votes should be added the thirty given to Mr. Cox, making one hundred and thirty-six to fifty two for Mr. Randall. Even that does not show the strength of Mr. Carlisle s position on revenue reform among Democrats, for Mr. Randall received some votes —four from Ma ryland, at least—on personal grounds. His vote was mainly from the Southwest and the great West, though he got a vote from Massa chusetts, two from California and the only vote from Nevada. Mr. Cox, who stood on a platform very similar to Mr. Carlisle s, re ceived his thirty votes from the following states —one from Alabama, three from Cali fornia, one from Illinois, one from Indiana, one from lowa, two from Massachusetts, two from Missouri, thirteen from New York, five from Ohio and one from Tennessee. It is thus seen that Mr. Carlisle’s platform is en dorsed by every section of the country. What is thought of Mr. Carlisle’s election and the position of the Democratic party on revenue reform may be learned from the ex tracts from leading Democratic, Republican and Independent papers throughout the coun try published in this issue. It will be ob served that the New York Times, the leading Republican paper in the couutry, says that Mr. Carlisle’s views are endorsed by a great many Republicans as well as the Democratic party, and warns its party that if it resists j revenue reform it will go before the country next year obviously weak. The Issue of 1884. Revenue Reform will be the leading issue of 1884. The Democrats have made it so, j and they will go before the country on that | platform confident of success. It will be an j aggressive campaign, fought upon principle. Tariff for revenue was a plank in the last Democratic national platform. Although the j party shrmik.from its discussion, the Repub cans took it up and made their whole fight | upon it. Yet, while they lost the Presidency, [ the Democrats had a majority on the popular . vole, and would have elected their candidates j but for the wholesale corruption of voters by money in Indiana, Ohio and New York par ticularly, and throughout the country in gen eral. Tariff for revenue won in Ohio last October, and will win in nearly every Western state next year. The South with Ohio, Indi ana and Illinois, with their 210 electoral votes, can elect a Democratic President without the aid of any Northern, Eastern or Pacific state. Yet both New Jersey and New York can be carried on the platform of revenue re form, also California and perhaps other states. The four Democratic congressmen from this . state voted against the views of their constit uencies in the Democratic caucus last Satur day night. Whether they did it as a personal favor or for the hope of position, it was wrong. Neither the one nor the other should weigh with representatives of the people. If they voted their sentiments, it was wrong, and a misrepresentation of those who elected them. A representative of the people should sink self and reflect the views of his constituents. None other can be a representative man. Maryland Democrats are opposed to protec tive tariff's for the sake of protection, and when their delegates voted for Randall for Speaker of the House, they voted against the sentiments and interests of the party. Let us send new men to the next congress. President Arthur transmitted his third an nual message to Congress on Tuesday. It is shorter than such documents usually are, yet i too long for the columns of a weekly paper, j and we publish a synopsis of it from the Bal timore Sun. This will be sufficient, for it is I a good summary, and few of our readers would care to read the whole message. The President has not said much to pro voke criticism, favorable or otherwise. The most of his message is a mere recital, in a business way, of facts and figures, and con tains but few recommendations. Alexander K. McClure, editor of the Phil adelphia Times, who for some years squinted j towards Democracy, is now giving evidence of dementia. He is for opposing the South ern “sectionalism’’ of the Democrats, as al leged in the election of Carlisle ns Speaker, by nominating Grant, “the strongest candi date northern sectionalism can present,’’ who would carry more southern states than any Republican in the country." If McClure does not need a straight jacket, then he is entitled to the cap and bells. . . —— Congress has organized and gone to work, j but little will be done until after the commit- | tees are formed in the House, which will be done next week. Two amendments to the constitution have been proposed in the Sen nte —one on civil rights of negroes, and the other to prohibit the manufacture, sale and importation of alcoholic liquors. Quite a number of bills have been introduced in each house on various subjects, many of which will not, and should not, ever get further than committee-rooms. The Virginia Legislature convened on Mon day last, the Democrats controlling both branches. In the House a member elected as a Mahoneite voted with the Democrats in electing officers. It is thought that other Democratic Readjusters will return to their old party before the session closes. In the Senate on Wednesday a resolution was intro duced requesting Mahone to resign as United ; States Senator. Senator Wickham voted i with the Democrat* in organizing the Senate, i The Speakership. | Hon. John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, was i on Saturday night last nominated for Speaker 1 of the House of Representatives by the Dcm ! ocratic caucus, and was formally elected at the opening of the session on Tuesday over Keifer, who. together with the officers of the last House, were renominated by the Repub lican caucus. Mr. Carlisle had two com petitors for Speaker, Hon. Samuel Randall, of Pennsylvania, and S. S. Cox, of New York. The vote in canons stood—Carlisle 106, Ran dall 52, Cox !!0. Hon. John B. Clarke, of Missouri, was nominated for clerk over J. D. C. Atkins, of Tennessee, the vote standing 95 to 92. John P. Lccdom, of Ohio, was chosen for sergeant at-arms by acclamation; J. G. Winlcrsmith, of Texas, was nominated for doorkeeper, and L. Dalton, of Indiana, for postmaster. These were all formally elected at the session of Congress on Tuesday. The Democratic caucus, on motion of Gen. Slocum, of New York, unanimously voted to continue all the old soldiers employed by the last House. 

SKETCH OF MU. CARLISLE. Mr. Carlisle was born in Campbell (now Kenton; county, Ky., Sept. 0, 1885. After completing his studies he taught school in his native county and later at Covington. He studied law with ex-Gov. Stevenson, who has since been in the United States Senate, and who is as fond as he is proud of his pupil. Mr. Carlisle’s entrance into politics followed close upon his admission to the bar. In 1859 he was a member of the State House of Rep resentatives; was nominated for presidential elector on the Democratic ticket in 1804, but declined; was elected to the State Senate in 1860 and re-elected in 1869; was a delegate at large from Kentucky to the national conven tion at New York in the summer of 1868; was nominated for Lieutenant-Governor of Ken tucky ip May, 1871; resigned his seat in the Senate in June, 1871, and served as Lieuten ant-Governor for the four years following; was a presidential elector for the State at large in 1870. His congressional career be gan March 5, 1877, when the Forty-fifth Con gress commenced, and he has therefore been only six years in achieving a national reputa tion for robust and vigorous leadership. Mr. Carlisle’s views on public questions are indicated in the following extract from a speech made two years ago, before his name had been seriously canvassed in connection with the speakership contest: “In the broad and sweeping sense which the use of the term generally implies, I am not a free-trader. Of course, that is under stood. At least it should be. I will add that, in my judgment, it will be years yet before anything in the nature of free trade would be wise or practicable for the United States. When we speak of this subject we refer to ap proximate free trade, which has no idea of crippling the growth of home industries, but simply of scaling down the iniquities of the tariff schedule, where they are utterly out of proportion to the demands of that growth. After we have calmly stood by and allowed monopolies to grow fat, we should not be asked to make them bloated. Our enormous surplus revenues are illogical and oppressive. It is entirely undemocratic to continue these burdens on the people for years and years after the requirements of protection have been met and the representatives of these industries ' have become encrusted with wealth. This is I the general proposition on which I stand. The rest is mere matter of detail, to be settled with judgment, discretion and caution, but at the same time iu a perfectly fearless spirit. There has not been a time in twenty years when the people were so thoroughly aroused on this subject, and it is the true policy of the Democratic party to make its appeal to the ; voting masses, and meet this hydra-headed ■ monopoly in solid phalanx.” COMMENTS OF THE PRESS. From the Baltimore Sun: “What Mr. Car- ; i lisle’s election does mean is revenue reform, directed by a wise and conservative intelli gence. For this the Democratic party has ] unequivocally declared, and as a party it is to be congratulated upon the possession ot the | ; courage required to take its stand in the out set upon so important a principle. There is no “Democratic mistake" here. The cry of “Wolf!” cannot prove effective against so popular a programme.” New York Times, Republican: “Thenom ination of Mr. Carlisle shows that there is j more life in the Democratic party than had j been generally supposed, and of a healthful sort, which is a matter for congratulation all around. Mr. Carlisle is by far the best rep i resentative among the candidates for the noin : ination of those Democrats who have cottyic | tions and conscience, and it is a good thing for the country that they are found to be in the majority—and a considerable majority— -lat Washington. Mr. Carlisle has a definite | and intelligent policy, which he has plainly | set forth and lived up to with unusual fidelity. J Mr. Carlisle will undoubtedly form his com | mittees so as to bring before the House the i qu stion of further reduction of the tariff’, j He will certainly be sustained in it by the ap- I proval of a very large portion of the Republi- I can voters. If the Republican Representa [ lives on the committees and in the House [shall offer to this policy a blind and partisan '’opposition, then they will so far force the Rc- I publican organization to follow them, and it | is not improbable that the canvass of next year may be one between the Democrats for rational revenue reform and the Republicans for extreme protection, and in such a canvass, with reference to this issue, the Republicans would obviously be weak, because they would be arrayed against the best interests and the strong tendency of the people. The nomina tion of Mr. Carlisle in itself shows a public opinion throughout wide sections of the coun try strong enough to overcome completely the tactics of the mere politicians and to defy the influences exerted by the most highly pro tected industries. That opinion is not by any means confined to the Democrats. It is na tional.” New York World (Dem.): “Mr. Carlisle’s | canvass has been simply an appeal to Demo cratic sincerity. He is not elected as a free trader or an extreme protectionist. He will have no special interests to subserve. He I will not be expected to make Republican alli ances. He is a revenue reformer. In this he is in accord with the large majority of his party and in antagonism to Republicanism, which opposes every retrenchment and re form.” The New York Herald (Ind.) says: “At last there is a promise of a Democratic party. Mr. Carlisle was last night chosen Speaker by the Democratic caucus at Washington. That means a change, a very great and beneficent change,’ iu Democratic policies. It means I that the old fogies of the party, the men afraid j of their principles, have lost their hold, and j the young men of the party —the men to whom politics mean something more than mere office-getting- —have come to the front. If the Democratic leaders have energy and in telligence, the caucus action of last evening J means a sweeping Democratic victory next ; year. For the first time in many years there | is before the party a fair prospect of such | popular favor as they have long been seeking | :by many devious and false roads. At last ; they are on the right track. The result is a ! severe disappointment to the Republican pnl ! iticians, who exclaim illogically but loudly i that it gives them the next presidency." i Philadelphia Press, (Rep.) “The noinina ; tion of Mr. Carlisle has the merit of being a j plain, bold, unequivocal avowal of the regnant Democratic spirit and purpose. There is no i disguise about it. Mr. Carlisle is the ablest I champion among all the Democratic Repre i sentatives of the opposition to protection. He will organize the House against the exist ing tariff', and lead the attack upon it. flic resuit simplifies the issue between the two : parties, and makes a straight, direct fight on the commanding question of protection. Chicago Herald [Deni. I “Mr. Carlisle was distinguished in the last Congress for the vigor and clearness with which he discussed the ; ordinarily dismal topic of the tariff, ft is his : | position on this question, and only this posi tion, which secures him the present leader ship, and will of neccessity force an issue be- i tween the parties in 1884 on the line which Randall sought to avoid. Revenue reform is to become a living question. From the Boston Herald (Ind.) The action of the Democratic congressional caucus in nominating Mr. Carlisle for Speaker is the | j most assuring evidence of returning political 1 sense and courage which the Democratic par jty has given for twenty years. It indicates ! | that the party has convictions and a policy, \ and is not afraid of one or ashamed of the other. It means that the controlling element of the party proposes to abandon the course pursued for the last deeade of marching in the rear of the Republican party and to lead the | way to the front. It justifies the existence of the’ Democratic party, by placing it in oppo sition to the Republicans, and committing it to the work of tax reduction and revenue re form. ( The Danville Riot. The Grand Jury of the Hustings Court, of Danville, Va., charged with the investigation of the circumstances of the recent riot, have reported that they have no presentments to make. They say that the negroes forced the light, and that the whites used their firearms in defense of their lives, which were in immi nent danger, and by their courage and pluck in standing up against such odds saved the ; lives of handl ed* of people in the city. | | Capt. Noah Fairbank, who commanded the j i first steamboat in Virginia waters, died at I Fredericksburg, Va., Saturday, at the age of i 97 years. President Arthur’s Message. From the Baltimore Sun. The President's message, delivered to Con gress on Tuesday, opens with the usual ence to the foreign relations of the United States, which he is able to state are every where peaceful. Of more immediate interest, ! however, is the recommendation, made by the | Secretary of the Navy and indorsed by the President, as an important measure of national defense in case of war with any foreign power, that immediate steps be taken for the creation of an interior coast line of water-ways across the peninsula of Florida, along the coast from Florida to Hampton Roads, between the Chesapeake bay and the Delaware river, and through Cape Cod, thus recognizing more or less directly the national character of the pro jected Chesapeake and Delaware ship-canal. Commercial treaties have been made with Servin, Roumania, Corea and Madagascar: legations have been established in Persia, Corea and Siam, and it is recommended that the interests of American citizens resident or trading in Bulgaria and the Central American States be cared for by the presence of consu lar representatives of the 1 nited States, i Reference is made to the Brazilian export duty on coffee, and to the penalties for technical faults applied to American vessels and cargoes in the Antilles, and the sugges tion is made that retaliatory measures applied to Spanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and Puerto Rico might not be barren of good re sults. Attention is called to the work of the International African Association in the Con go valley, and Congress is reminded that it may be advisable for us to co-operate with other commercial powers in promoting the rights of trade in that region “free from the interference or political control of any one nation.” No large reduction of revenues is advised. Congress is reminded that a tariff bill has been recently passed, the results of which are not yet sufficiently apparent to war rant a further modification of the tariff or in ternal revenue laws. He states, however, that the legislation referred to has cut down the income of the government some fifty or sixty millions of dollars — a statement at vari ance with that made by the Secretary of the Treasury, who puts the net reduction at but $30,000,000. The surplus of revenue over ex penditure, which the President estimates at $60,000,000, it is recommended should be spent in rehabilitating our navy and providing coast defenses. The suggestion of the Secre tary of the Treasury us to the proper method of perpetuating the national bank system is approved. It is accordingly recommended that the tax of 1 per cent, on the circulation of the national banks be repealed, and that the amount of the circulation allowed on-bonds deposited for security be increased to 90 per ! cent, on the market value of such bonds. , 1 The effect of this would be to make it profita ] ble to the banks to base their circulation on ‘ 4 per cents, which are not redeemable till , 1907. With respect to the disposition to be j made of trade dollars the President and Sec retary of the Treasury, while not favoring ex j actly the same plan, are in subtantial agree | ment. The former recommends that the trade dollar be accepted by the treasury and the | mints as bullion at a small percentage above | the current market price of silver of like line- I ness. The Secretary suggested simply that I the standard silver dollar be exchanged, dol | lar for dollar, for the trade dollar, the latter to be regarded as so much bullion bought under the act of 1878. Approval is given also the : Secretary of the Treasury’s plan for the con solidation of certain customs districts, and it is added that by the reduction of internal rev enue districts, recently perfected, their num ber has been reduced from 120 to 83. Dwel i ling on the unprotected condition of our extend \ ed sea-coast, the number of large and wealthy I cities with which it is dotted, the age and ; weakness of our works of defense, their in | ferior armament and imperfeettorpedo equip ; ment, the President urges the reconstruction of our navy and the building of plant for the manufacture of heavy ordnance, and points to the overflowing condition of the treasury as a I fact that renders the present the proper time ; for the inception of so patriotic a work. At tention is called to the growth of the number of postoffices from 46,231 in 1882 to 47,863 in 1883. The recommendation is made, adver sely to the views of the Postmaster-General, that the rate of postage on drop letters, which at present is two cents where the carrier sys | tem is established and one cent elsewhere, be I made uniform by reducing it everywhere to I one cent. Reference is made to the long- I mooted proposition that the government should assume the same control over the telegraph j that it has always exercised over the mail, but the President is unable to accord his ap proval to the project. The suggestion is made, however, that the government should be authorized to exercise some sort of supervis ion over interstate telegraphic communica tion. The fees of jurors and witnesses in the Federal courts, fixed by laws of old date, are insufficient. It is recommended that they be increased, and that district attorneys stud ; marshals be paid by salaries, rather than as at present, by fees—a change which, it is sug gested, may diminish the number of prosecu tions made mcarly for the sake of fees. Con gress is invited to consider the important ques tion whether Federal aid may not with pro- | priety be extended to public primary educa- ! tion in parts of the country where the percen tage of illiteracy is high. The failure of the j anti-polygamy legislation of March, 1882, is j cited, and the strong recommendation is made that Congress repeal the act upon which the existing government of Utah depends, assume control of the Territory, and establish in au thority a commission with powers fitting it to deal effectively with the Mormon problem, i The queston of regulating interstate commerce is presented for consideration. The right of railway corporations to reasonable profits is j conceded, but Congress should protect the people from injustice. The effects ot the civil-service act in the short time during which i it has been in operation are pronounced ben- ! ■ eficiat. The act passed by the Senate at its \ last session regulating the presidential succes sion is recommended to the favorable consid ! eration of the present Congress. It is asked | i that the Executive he empowered to veto | particular items of an appropriation without | I imparing the validity ot other items which meet his approval. In concluding, the Pres ident recommends the passage of a new civil rights bill guaranteeing to the colored citizen the right secured to him by the fourteenth amendment. Exciting Scene in a Court-Room. A correspondent of the Journal at Prescott, i | Arizona, gives the following account of a 1 tragedy enacted in a court-room, in which j Judge French, the Chief Justice of the Terri- i tory, was presiding at the trial of a case euti- I tied Kelsey vs. McAtee, regarding a water ! right for irrigating purposes : “In arguing a question regarding the ad missibility of certain testimony in the case on i trial Attorney-General Churchill and District i Attorney Ruch became greatly excited and I finally came to blows. While the officers i were endeavoring to restore order McAtee, ; the defendant, drew a knife, rushed upon a man named Moore, aged seventy, and inflict ed a fatal wound. Then, turning on C. W. i Beach, late editor of the Prescott Miner and son-in-law of Kelsey, the plaintiff, stabbed ( him in the nock. He then made a rush for the court reporter and was about to plunge his knife into him when Mr. Beach drew a re- | volver, sending a ball through McAtee s spi- I nal column. • “Order was immediately restored. Moore j and McAtee will die. Mr. Beach will re- i cover.” Makes One’s Hair Stand on End. From the Baltimorean : The proprietors of the Democratic Adrocate, i Westminster, Md.. announce that their jour nal has entered its 19th year. It is one of the most readable papers in the State, but in times of high party excitement the editors do exhibit their fierce Democracy with an inten j sity that fairly makes one's hair stand on end. The Advocate has the courage of its con victions, and is thoroughly Democratic. It is ■ ! not blown about by every wind of doctrine. It does not run after false gods. It renders no half-hearted service to its party. It believes , in supporting Democratic principles, and that those principles cun best be sustained by | maintaining the organization of the party against all insidious efforts to weaken or de- j stroy it. I Scientists have been puzzling their wits over | the cause of the lurid mornings and evenings ! we have had recently. May it not be traced i to a reflection of the “bloody-shirt" Mahone has held high advanced since the late elec- ; tion ? Always Interesting. ( From the Emmi/lshai f/ Chronirle : The Democratic Adrocate published at Westminster entered upon its Nineteenth Volume last Saturday. Its progress has been steadily onward from its foundation. It is an 1 excellent county paper and is always inter : esting, and as such is a most welcome ex i change in our office.

On the eve I of his departue he was waited upon by about fifty of his friends and presented with a hand- | some purse, well filled, accompanied by an , address expressive of the sincere regret felt at j the separation, and well wishes for Father Crowley's future. William Cromwell, a well-known young i man, residing in the vicinity of Mount Carmel, ’ Frederick county, while return ing on Tuesday ; evening from a visit to a neighbor, found a large : butcher knife, which he carlessly stuck into his left boot leg, allowing the blade to pro- j trade. In getting over a fence the sharp edge of the knife struck his right leg, severing the main arteries of the limb. He fell to the I ground in a helpless condition, and it was only after a considerable time that his feeble cries were heard and he was taken -to his j home. He had lost so much blood, however, I that his life could not be saved, his death oc curring Wednesday morning. Carlisle’s Speech. Following is Hon. John S. Carlisle's speech upon taking the chair after his election as speaker of the House of Representatives on Monday: Gentlemen* of the Horse of Represen tatives : I thank you sincerely for the high honor conferred upon me by the vote just taken. To be chosen from the membership of a great body like this to preside over its deliberations is a distinction upon which any citizen might properly congratulate himself, and I assure you that your kindness and par tiality are fully appreciated. At the same time I realize the fact that the position to which you have assigned me is one of very great labor and responsibility, and, while pro foundly grateful to you for this manifestation of your confidence, I shall enter on the dis charge of its duties with a serious distrust of my capacity to meet in an acceptable manner the requirements of this office. I promise you, however, to devote to your service all the zeal and all the ability of which lam possessed. Gentlemen, the maintenance of order on the floor is essential—absolutely i essential —to the intelligent systematic trans action of public business, and I earnestly in voke your assistance in the enforcement of the rules adopted for the government of our pro ceedings. The large addition to the mem bership of this House, resulting from the late apportionment of Representatives, makes this duty even more difficult than it has been be fore, and without your cordial co-operation and support I cannot reasonably hope evenly to discharge the ordinary daily duties of this office. That you will cheerfully co-operate j with me in every proper effort to preserve I order and to facilitate the business of legisla tion, I have no doubt. I Sudden and radical changes in the laws and regulations affecting the commercial and in dustrial interests of the people ought never be made, unless imperatively demanded by some public emergency ; and, in my opinion, under existing circumstances, such changes would not be favorably received by any considerable ! number of those who have given serious at tention to the subject. [Applause.] Many re forms are undoubtedly necessary, and it will be your duty, after a careful examination of : the whole subject in all its bearings, to decide | j how far they should extend, and when and in • what manner they should be made. [Ap | plause.] If there be any who fear that your action on this, or any other subject, will ac tually be injurious to any interests or even afford reasonable cause for alarm, I am quite j sure that they will be agreeably disappointed. [Applause. ] What the country has a right to expect is strict economy in the administration of every j department of the Government; just and j equal taxation for public purposes ; a faithful I observance of the limitations of the Constitu- j tion, and a scrupulous regard for the rights ] i and interests of the great body of the people, j ! in order that power to protect them against | encroachment from every direction. What- j ! ever can be done, under the circumstances j surrounding us, to meet this expectation, ought to be done, in my judgment. [Applause.] But, gentlemen, without detaining you fur ; ther, I am ready to take the oath of office pre- j scribed by the Constitution and the Laws and proceed to the complete organization of the House. The suit of Charles D. Gilmour, formerly of Washington, against Carl Schurz fors3oo,- i IKK) damages, has been removed from the i Supreme Court of New York to the United j I States Court.
