His Secret Majesty sits enthroned at Washington, with Ste vens and Wadeand Fornevas his min isters of State. Time was when the laws of our country were made in the light of day, when every member of the legislative body was permitted to lake part in thedeterminaiion of ques tion- before it, when a free peopleeould sit in the galleries and listen to all the arguments adduced on all sides of siu h questions; but now a parli/.an majori ty meet in secret- conelave, and deter mine, as partizans, not as honest legis lators, what laws are to he enacted ai: 1 what, measures are to be rejected. To night they resolve to pi-- a certain bill; to-innrrow it wiil be reported in the House and passed under the gag of the previous question and the whip and .-pur of the slave-drivers of the Rump. The minority are allowed to protest and—that is all. The pa--uge of the measure has been pre-determin ed by the secret C-twits, and nothing can prevent its adoption. Now, we submit, in all candor, is this legi-lation according to the spirit and intent of a Republican government? Are our laws to be made by a secret Cawus, in stead of an open L'i/iskdnn Are the minority to be considered as nonenti ties who have no brains to think, and no tongues to speak, or rather who have no right to exercise their brains in thinking, or their tongue- in speak ing? If so, let the people know it. If so, King Caucus mu-t he slain! We say, given- Revolution, give us War, give us Death, rather than such -la very ! XVIII oovr vol TRY HIM? Mr. Mongrel, why don't your recon structed, regenerated Supreme Court proceed with the trial of Jefferson Davis ? You have called him "traitor," you have accused him of murder, you have damned him as the vilest incar nation of all that is evil and hateful; now, why don't you try him, anil if found guilty of treason, or murder, or arson, or larceny, by a jury of his peers, empaneled according to law, punish him according to the grade of his of fence? Why do you keep him im mured in that fort down by the sea, boarding and clothing and guarding him at the expense of the government? If his guilt be so patent and indisputa ble, there can be no doubt of his convic tion. You would try a common felon, a horse-thief, a highway robber, or a murderer, but this criminal of crimi nals, this prince of traitors (so your vocabulary runs; you refuse to try, and through your negligence lie remains unhanged. Yet you prate about the "punishment of treason," and "trai tor-" being made "odious." Ah ! ye hypocrites! You are afraid lest the Supreme Court will define "treason" a somcthiug el-e than what you have been preaching fur the last six years. You fear that your own Judge Chase, holding his old State Right views, under which he and you nullified the Federal Fugitive Slave Law, will be compelled to decide that Davi* is not ffttifh/ of In ■son. We understand you, and the people will, sooner or later, learn to understand you. You had better try that man in prison down at Fortress Monroe. Your masters, the people, are beginning to inquire into the cause of your delay. Look out! oh, ye slippery, there are some sharp turns in your path, around which you will find it troublesome to wriggle. You had better try Jeff. Davis before the next election in Pennsylvania. THE Franklin Ileposilory seems to think that a political organization oyght not to rejoice at the overthrow of doctrines which it combats, but only over the attainment of the sjwils by the success of it- candidates for office. Not an unnatural conclusion to he arrived at by Col. M'Clure. THE Franklin Ileposilory, of last v. eel,. -ay- that there are forty candi dates for th- Mongrel nomination for t U. S. Senator. DIM. TIMES. "Business is dull!" Such is the ex clamation we hear, now-a-days, from every body. Well, is it any wonder ; that business is dull?" For the year ; ending June 30,1806, the Federal (lov er u men t collected from the people of > the United States, over fee hundred ; millions of dollars in the shape of tax es. For the present year the estimate j : from the samesourccs is; hundred and \ffty millions of dollars! In 18-3S-9, a fellow by the name of Ed. McPherson, whom some of the Mongrels in this Congressional district may remember, got himself elected to Congress, on the | ground that the people were taxed too ; heavily to keep up the government, which was then administered at a cost of about niin!y millions per annum, and j without any Interna' It- venue Tax \ whatever. All the financial troubles of the country were then laid at the j j door of the Democracy, because, as was j alleged, the expenditures of the Gov ernment bore too heavily upon the pro ductive industry of the country! If, ' McPherson and his party stated the ; true cause of the depression in business i then, how much greater reason is there , to believe that the same cause quintup led in degree, is at the bottom of the dudne-s in business, now? The fact is that the Mongrel Rump Congress has legislated capital into the hands of the i few an 1 taxed the many so outrageous- I ly, that we are fast tending toward a financial pmic. A change in t'ae polit ical complexion oi Congress must lie I and will he had, ere this state of tilings | can be remedied. , Tin: Rump Congress, as will be seen hv the proceedings of Monday last, are about to begin the work of legislating I the President out of office. The cow ardly knave- dare not impeach him. They are afraid of the wrath of the people. Impeachment would cause I the populace to pause and think even in the midst of the whirlwind before : which they are being driven to the dev il. Hence the plotting miscreants who load and drive the Rump, mean to ac complish by indirection, what they fear to undertake by an open and un disguised effort. They wiil take the pardoning power from the President; they will rob him of the appointing power; they will pass laws over his veto and compel him to execute them ; and thus they will shear him of all strength and make the Presidential of fice a blank in the government. With the Executive thus blotted out of ex istence, we -hall be ruled by an oligar chy, a miserable, corrupt and tyran nical (aliens, in defiance of the Consti tution and in utter contempt of the in- j tere-tsand safetv of the people. Thus i- our form of government about to he overturned. Thus is the rebellion of the Rump being quietly carried for ward to -ueee—. Will we, ought we, I can we submit to tyranny like this? The Democrat- of Bedford county held a jollification on Monday !a-i cel ebrating the defeat of the Con-titution- ! al Amendment in the late elections. The Gazette in one of its headings on ; the subject, has the following: "Hick ory may be lien t bin cannot be broken." The "unterrified" of Bedford have a better way of bending to iheir defeat than that of other counties.—Hunting don Globe. That's a fact, Brother Lewis. Don't f you remember that Douglas flag-raising in S toner-town, six years ago? There was quite a bender then and there, but nothing was broken.

Ac. Correspondence of the Bedford Gazette. WASHINGTON, D. C., i Dec. I, 1860. j MR. EDITOR: —I arrived here yester day and found a half a dozen Senators and about twice that number of M.C's scattered about at f he different hotels. They are a shabby looking set and I instinctively clapped my hand on my pocket-book whenever I came near one of them. Old Thad. has been ! ! hobbling around here for some days, i It is said that he is preparing articles! of impeachment upon which Andy Johnson is to he tried by the Bump Senate. I have no doubt that Thadde us would like to have the President I kicked out, hut he is a little afraid of the effect which an attempt at that sort of thing would have upon the future of the Mongrel party. He may have been thinking seriously of preferring article- of impeachment against the President, but some of the moneyed men of his party have doubtless put j martingals and holding-hack-straps on j him, and I think he win beeurbed, and if necessary, thrown back upon his i haunches, by the Jehu- who drive the Bump wagon. Chase, the peripatetic, speech-making, caucusing, Jeff. Davis dodging, negro-palavering "Chief Jus : tic" has been to see the aforesaid Tlmd deus, and lias, doubtless, given him a wordof caution. The slippery Salmon has no idea of having the chances of i the next Mongrel candidate for th< Pn-idcncy, spoiled by any -ueh foolish operation as the impeachment of ITes i blent Johnson. This is quite natural. Salmon expects to be that candidate | himself. There is some speculation here as to the political tone of the forthcoming message of the President. The best information lean get on the subject, as-ures me that Mr. Johnson will not j abandon any of the positions assumed iby him during th past year. He need not re-iterate those positions in his inc.—age. He has stated them fully in former messages and in public speeches. He has urged the propriety of their a doption by Congress, which the latter ha.- persistently and insultingly rcfu - (1 to do, and now he can do nothing more than wait for Congress to act. The Amendment proposed at the last session is dead, there being no possibil ity of its ratification by the constitu tional three fourths of the States, hence Congress will be compelled to set up a new programme. With reference to this the Pre-ident occupies the vantage ground, for he has defeated the former i plan of Congress and am, in the same manner, defeat any unconstitutional or improper proposition. Therefore, the President can afford to wait until ('ongress moves. There is still some talk about the re moval of Secretary Stanton. I doubt whether there is any pro!lability of ■ such an auspicious event occurring very soon. However, should a change le made in the War Office, I hope some able Pennsylvania!! will he made the ; new Secretary. The Keystone State is always the battle-ground in Presiden tial elections, and a vigorous and ear nest man in the Cabinet would in-ure a Conservative triumph in that State. 1 know that Stanton permitted Thad. Stevens to use the patronage of the War Department against the political friends of the President in the late campaign, if Mr. John-on knows this, he ought not to expect the people to support him so long as he encoura ge- such treason in ids own Cabinet. If lie is ignorant of it, it i- high time : that heshouid beenlightened in regard to it. It can easily he proved, and if the President desires the evidence it will be laid before him. A "mass welcome" is to be given to the Buuiperson the 10th in-t., under the auspicesof the Shoddy contractors, Uniform-manufacturer-, Sutler-, Camp follower- and such Cotton-stealing (ien ; erals as Banks and Butler, connected I with the late war. They have invited the true soldiers of the country to par ticipate in their humbug, with the double purpo- • of over-aweing the President and of committing the sol diers to an endorsement of Congress ional usurpation. But the real secret at the bottom of this movement is, j that the chaps who are at the head of it, have "axes to grind" which grind i iugthey want to have done on the C'on gre -ional grind-stone. Hence, they I hope to propitiate the grim Bout well ' and the terrible Stevens, by tickling their vanity and appeasing their ap i petite for the "creauturn -omforts." | Congress will meet on M nday next, i Lively times may be expected among the Solous of that laxly, i hear that j an effort will be ma le to provide, by j the pa-sage of a law, for the assembling ! of tiie next Congress on the nth of March, IXO7, theday following the ex piration of the legal existence of the present Bump, so that Congress may be in continual session and take the government in its own hands. A re publfan proposition, truly! But e nough for this time from PBY.

The question of raising the negro to full political equality with white men, says the Age, cannot be detached from the general one connected with a i speedy and satisfactory adjustment of i j tlie issues now dividing the States, j | They are indissolubly associated. \ So long as the Radicals insist upon making the acceptance of the doctrine : of negro suffrage by the South neees-j I sary in order that their claims for po I litical fellowship may be considered, ! so long will they act in a manner cal culated to keep the States apart and ! alienate the people. The negro ques- j | tion is one full of danger in the future. 1 It is so recognized by aU the leading soldiers and statesmen of the country. The following sentiments expressed in ; General Sherman's well-known letter to Chief Justice Chase, just after the' ■ close of his great march v are important | jas bearing upon this point. The Gen- j | eral writes as follows: STEAM EU PRUSSIA, BEAUFORT JIAKRUB, \ M:Y 6, JSO6 —S o'clock P. X. J I am not yet prepared to receive the I negro on terms of political equality, for the reason it will raise passions and i prejudices at the North, superadded to | the causes yet dormant at the South, that might rekindle the war, whose i fires are now dying out, and which, by i skillful management might he kept j down. As you must observe, I pro pose to work with known facts rather ; than to reason ahead to remote conclu ■ I sions. j **•***•* We can control the local State capi tals, and, it may be, slowly shape po-! litical thoughts, hut we cannot combat; existing ideas with force. I ■■HI/ honestly that (HE (insertion openly \ "f your ideas of universal neyro suffrage ! as a fixed policy of our general govern men I, to be bucked by physical power,, will produce a new war sooner or later, i and one which, from its desultory char .! acter, will be more bloody and destructive I than (he hist. L think the changes ne ! cessary in the future can he faster and j more certainly made by means of our Constitution than by any plan outside of it. * Now, if we go outside of the ; Constitution l'or a means of change, we i rather justify the rebels in their late , attempt, whereas now, as General Sco : lieid tells us, the people of the South are ready and willing to make the ne- I cessary changes, without shock or vio j lence. 1 felt the last war as bitterly : and as keenly as any man could, and 1 ' fruit! ly confess myself afraid of a new ' war ; and a new war is hound to result | from the action you suggest of giving I to the enfranchised negroes so large a share in the delicate task of putting the Southern States in practical working relations with the general government. M:\VS AMI OTHI:K ITEMS. j —On Thursday last Secretary Seward read at a special Cabinet meeting the draft of his dispatch to Minister Bige ; low, commenting on Napoleon's breach ! of faith in not withdrawing the French i troops according to agreement. After 1 thcdespatch was read the Cabinet voted j unanimously that its tone he made i stronger by insisting that the French j troops be withdrawn in pursuance of ; the previous arrangement to that effect. | Another despatch from Washington states that the only cause of the delay on the part of France arose ironi the fact that it has been thought more pru dent to remove the whole of the French troops from Mexico at once. No offi cial confirmation of the report that ■ General Sedgwick had crossed the Rio ■ Grande has been received at Washing ! ton, and it is therefore believed that I the statement is untrue. i —-We have from Salt Lake a report that Brigham Young is about to retire | temporarily from his capital, and take up his abode on a plantation owned by | him, sonic sixty miles south of Salt !

THE HI JIP < o\(, S:I:SN. WASHINGTON, Dee. 3. The weather is as pleasant as could he desired. The galieries of the two branches of Congress are densely crowd ed. Those of the House are not suffi ciently large to accommodate all seek ers of admission. The members of the House are present in full force. Long before noon the men of both parties were seen shaking hands with marked cordiality, and conversing on other subjects than politics. A mere looker on would scarcely suspect that differences ever divided them, so hearty are they in greeting. 

SENATE. The Senate was called to order at 12 o'clock precisely, by Mr. Foster, presi dent, protein. Prayer hv the Chaplain, Rev. Dr. Gray, of the Baptist church. Mr. Anthony presented the follow ing resolves, winch were severally adopted : That the Secretary inform the House that a quorum of the Senate is assem bled ; that the hours for meeting of the Senate he twelve o'clock, until otherwise ordered; that a committee of two lie appointed to join a commit- j tee of the House and wait upon the President to receive his message. Mr. Sunnier said if there was no bu- | sine.— before the Senate he would move i to call up Senate hill No. 1, "An act to regulate the elective franchise in the District of Columbia." 

HOUSE. The Rev. Dr. Boynton opened the House with a prayer of thankfulness for the results of the late elections, which tend, he said, to establish the principles of liberty to all classes and conditions of men. The roll of members was called, when one hundred and forty-six answered to their names. Three new members were sworn in from Tennessee and two from Kentucky. A committee was appointed to wait on the President and inform him that Congress had assembled and was ready to receive any communication. Mr. Eliot, Mass., asked leave to in troduce a hill to repeal the 13th section of the act of July 17th, 1862, which section authorizes the President to grant pardon and amnesty to persons who took part in the rebellion. Mr. Finck, Ohio, objected, and the rules were suspended so as to allow the bill to bo introduced. (Mr. Eliot's bill was then put upon | it- passage, and was passed by a vote of | 111 to 23. A resolution was adopted calling for ! information as to the arrest and escape of John 11. Surratt. A hill was introduced and referred, directing the sale of $2,000,000 of gold by the Secretary of the Treasury, ev ery Monday; also, a bill for the meet ing of Congress on the Ith of March. 2 p.m. —The President's message has just been received.
