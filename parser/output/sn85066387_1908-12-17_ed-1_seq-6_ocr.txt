BAILEY CRIES "GROSS IXSUI/T" Bailey objected to the resolution be cause it did not direct the committee to inquire into the "very trross and wan ton" -words of the president's message. "No action." he said, "should.be taken on the resolution until that point is covered. Either congress is th*> most infamous body that ever assembled in any country of the world or it will take some notice of this most wanton and gross insult ever given any body in the world." Aldrich insisted that the resolution provided for just what Bailey advo cate. TiUman insisted that according to tli« president's message congress is composed of a lot of "rascals and scoundrels who belong In the peniten tiary." i:\DIU\ATIb.V I.V 

SE.YATE Hale replied that there had been a great deal of "restlessness and indig nation in the senate." "Th<?r<? is no restlessness et the White House." retorted Tillman. "They ar* content and calm as can be there." Culberson said the message "was a deliberate, studied and gratuitous in sult to the congress by the president" Newlands declared that the question* at issue was whether the secret service had been used to investigate congress man in the pursuance of the?r legisla tive duties, or-was only to detect fraud in the duties devolving upo;i the ex ecutive departments. He was not at tempting to apologize for the president, but wanted to have the senate avoid any hasty and improper language. Agreement Not a Treaty 

WASHINGTON-. Drc I «*— Secretary Hoot, before the senate committee on foreign relations today, pointed out that the only obligation upon, either party to the entente between -the' United States and Japan relating to the maintenafnee of China's integrity is that they shall consult with each other before undertaking any action concerning Chinese affairs, and there fore the agreement does not assume the character of a treaty. If no ac tion Is taken' by the r committee the .whole matter will remain as nego tiated by the secretary of state. Nominated for Office WASHINGTON, Dec.

Examination, of these archives by Charlton and Rogers show, however; that neither, at the time, of the first examination nor how. were there any lists of stockholders in the old: or new Panama canal company except those contained in the formal" minutes..

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind^. Dec. 16. — The Indianapolis News, mentioned in the special messages on the Panama canal deal, sent to .congress yesterday by President Roosevelt, today issued a're ply to the chief executive. It says: "It is difficult to characterize-fully the latest outbreak of the president without resorting to the use of lan guage as undignified and. blameworthy as that which puts the president's ut terance In a class by itself in, the offi cial literature of the high office he holds. Whatever provocation • ". -Mr. Roosevelt may have felt pricking his soul nothing could justify or extenuate the torrent of invective and virulence whjch he poured out In a state paper upon the head of private citizens. No one in hie sober senses can fail to re gard the performance as a grave dero gation to the dignity of the presiden tial station, a pitiable exhibition of towering rage on the part of the chief magistrate and the source of humilia tion and chagrin to the entire country." -Bryan Blames Roosevelt. 

LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. 16.—Comment ing on the trouble between President Roosevelt and Joseph Pulitzer of the New York World. William J. Bryan comes out strongly on the side of the latter and .warns 'the president that he can not muzzle the press. Under the heading, "President Oversteps f> the Limit." Bryan will say in his^Com moner: "President Roosevelt has sent t<vcon gres3 a message which announces a new and dangerous doctrine. It is the duty of every publisher and every be liever in free speech and a free press to rerent the president's attempt to use the government to terrorize those who would criticise the action of pub lic officials. "It is a matter of little consequence whether the charges made by the New York World are true or false— that be determined- by a suit at law in the ordinary" way— but it is a matter/ of great importance that every editor and every other individual shall be free to express his opinion on any subject con nected \u25a0with public affairs."
