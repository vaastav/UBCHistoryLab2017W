Both fighters completed their training yesterday and professed themselves as ready and fit for the best battle of their lives. For Beckett, victory means fame and a chance for farther world glory. For the Frenchman, who has been In the spotlight for years, victory means enough money to resume op erations on his mining property In the region devastated by Germany. Beckett is not the least bit wor lied. He Is not given much to tails log. but he did say in his slow, heavy way, "I shall win. Dempsey next." Carpentier, more volatile, smiled happily and said: "I mean to win, and am confident 1 shall beat Beckett. Perhaps not! very easily, but I shall beat him." Considerable British money went on the Frenchman today. Carpentier has always been a prime favorite In London, and some of the fans took a hunch from the statements of Bugene Corrie, Eddie McGoorty and other notables that Beckett would lose.

(By Press Henry L. Farrell, United Staff Correspondent] NEW YORK, Dec. 4.—II there were not so many "ifs" to consider, doping the winner of the Carpentier-Beckett fight tonight in London would be a simple process. London, after seeing both battlers, ha made Beckett a 5 to 4 favorite, fie appears to be the logical winner. In a twenty round battle the old axiom of brains being better than brawn does not always go. Carpentier, a boxer of the scientific Beckett packs the well known wal lop and if Georges is able to dance away from him through the fight un til the Welshman gets tired he has a chance to win on points. On the other hand, Beckett's rush ing, slugging tactics may force the Frenchman to lay aside some of his science and mix it. Xhe Englishman Extra Innings. New York Is the meeting. Mrs. C.
