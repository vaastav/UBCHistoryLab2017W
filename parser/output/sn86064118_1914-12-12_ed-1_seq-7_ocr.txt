TULSA, OKLA.. STAR r & :,:-. 9 EMPTY MARKETS TURN TO AMERICA Europe Will Need Our Help, Says President in Message to Con gressShips Our Greatest Need New Tasks and Du ties Imposed on United States by the War. 7ashlngton, Dec. 8. The necessity for legislation to prodvlde for trans portation of our commerce by sea was strongly urged by President Wilson In his message to congress today. Tho president pointed out that tho markets of tho greater part of tho world are mpty and that ours Is tho duty to sup ply tho needs not only of tho coun tries of Kuropo, but nUo of tho coun tries which hitherto have looked to Europo for their supplies. Tho mes ago in part follows: Tho session upon which you are now cntorlng will bo tho o'oslng session of tho Sixty-third congress, a congress, I venturo to say, which will long bo re membered for tho great body of thoughtful nnd constructive work which It has dono, In loyal response to tho thought and needs of tho coun try. Whllo wo have worked at our tasks of pcaco tho circumstances of tho whole ngo havo been altered by war. What wo havo dono for our own lnrl nnd our own peoplo wo did with this best that was In us, whether of char acter or of Intelligence, with sober enthusiasm and a confidence In tho principles upon which wo were acting which sustained us nt every step of tho dim cult undertaking; but It Is dono. It haB passed from our hands. "Wo faco now tasks, havo been facing them theso six months, must faco them In tho months to come face them without partisan feeling, like men who have forgotten everything but a common duty nnd tho fact that wo aro representatives of a great people whoso thought Is not of us but of what America owes to herself and to all mankind In such circumstances as theso upon which wo look amazed and anxious. Europe Will Need Our Help. War has Interrupted tho means of trade not only but alBO tho processes of production. In Europo it Is destroy ing men and resources wholesalo and upon a scalo unprecedented and ap palling. There is reason to fear that the time Is near, if It be not already at hand, when soveral of tho coun tries of Europo will find It difficult to lo for their peoplo what they hnvo hlth r'.o been always easily nblo to do, many essential nnd fundamental things. At any rato they will need our help and our manifold services as they havo never needed them before; and wo should bo ready, moro lit and ready than wo havo ever been. If Is of equal conscqucnco that tho nations whom Europo has usually sup plied with Innumerable) articles of manufacture and commerco can now get only a small part of what they formerly Imported nnd eagerly look to us to supply their all but empty markets. Hero aro markets which wo must supply, and wo must find tho means of action. We Need Ships. It Is a very practical matter, a mat ter of ways and menus. Wo havo the resources, but aro we fully ready to use them? And If wo can mado ready what wo havo, havo wo tho menns at hand to distribute it? We aro not fully ready; neither havo wo the means of distribution. Wo aro willing, but we are not fully nblo. We havo the wish to servo and to servo greatly, gener ously; but wo are not prepared is wo should bo. Wo aro not ready to mo bilize our resources at onco. Wo nro not prepared to uso them Immediate' and nt their best, without delay and without waste. To speak plainly we havo grossly erred In tho way in which wo havo stunted nnd hindered the development of our merchant mnrlno. And now, when we need ships, wo havo not got them. ( havo como to ask you to remedy and correct theso mistakes and omis sions. Tho tlmo and tho circum stances nro extraordinary, and bo must our efforts bo also. Use and Conservation. Fortunately, two great measures, finely conceived, tho ono to unlock, with proper safeguards, tho resources of tho national domain, tho other to encourngo tho use of tho navigable waters outsldo that domain for the generation of power, have already passed tho house of representatives and are ready for Immcdlato consider ation and action by the senate. With tho deepest earnestness I urgo their prompt passage. And there Is another great pleco of legislation which awaits and should rccelvo tho sanction of the eenate: 1 mean the bill which gives a larger measure of self-government to tho peo plo of the Philippines. I cannot believe that the scnato will let this great measuro of constructive Justice await tho action of another congress. Its passago would nobly crown the record of these two years of memorable la bor. An Important Duty. But I think that you will agree with mo that this does not complete tho toll of our duty. How aro wo to carry our goods to tho empty markets of which I have spoken if wo havo not tho certain nnd constant means of transportation upon which all profit ablo and useful commerco depends? And how nro wo to get tho ships If wo wait for the trado to dovclop with out them? Tho routes of trade must bo actually opened by many ships nnd regular sailings nnd moderate charges before streams of merchandise will flow frco ly and profitably through them. Must Open Gates of Trade. Ilcnco tho pending shipping bill, discussed at tho last session, but as yet passed by neither houso. In my Judgment such legislation Is impera tively needed and cannot wisely bo postponed. Tho government must open theso gates of trado. I very earn estly hope that tho congress will adopt this exceedingly Important bill. Tho great subject of rural credits still remains to bo dealt with, and it Is a matter of deep regret that tho dllllcultles of tho subject havo seemed to render It imposslblo to completo a bill for passage at this session. Dut It cannot bo perfected yet Economy Is Urged. rioforo I close, may I say a fow words upon two topics, much dis cussed out of doors, upon which it is highly Important that our Judgments should bo clear, deflnlto and steadfast. Ono of these Is economy In govern ment expenditures. Tho sort of economy wo ought to practice may bo effected, and ought to bo effected, by a careful study and assessment of tho tasks to bo per formed; and tho money spent ought to bu mado to yield the best possible returns In efficiency and achievement And, llko good stewards, wo should so account for every dollar of our ap propriations as to mako It perfectly -evident what it was spent fof and lti what way It was spent. It is not expendlturo but oxtrnvn gance that wo should fear being criti cized for; not paying for the legiti mate enterprises nnd undertakings of a great government whose peoplo command what It should do, but add ing what will benefit only a fow or pouring money out for what need not havo boon undertaken nt nil or might have been postponed or better and more economically conceived and car ried out. The nation is not .ilggardly; It Is very generous. It will chldo us only If wo forgot for whom wo pay money out and whoso money It is wo pay. Theso are largo nnd general stand ards, but they aro not very difficult of application to particular cases. The National Defense. Tho other topic I shall take lcavo to mention goes deeper Into tho princi ples of our national llfo and policy. It is tho subject of national defense. It cannot bo discussed without first nnsworlng eomo vory searching ques tions. It is E-ild in somo quarters that wo aro not prepared for war. What is meant by being prepared? Is it meant that wo aro not ready upon brief no tlco to put a nation in tho field, a na tion of men trained to arms? Of courso wo aro not ready to do that; and wo shall novor bo In tlmo of peace so long na wo retain our pres ent political principles, and institu tions. And ..Uat Is it that it is sug gested wo should bo prepared to do? To defend ourselves against attack? Wo hnvo always found means to do that, and shall find them whenever It, is necessary without calling our peo ple away from their necessary taska to render compulsory military servlco In times of pcaco. Fear No Nation. Wo are at pcaco with ..11 tho world. No one who speaks counsel based on fact or drawn from a Just and candid interpretation of realities can say that tbcro is reason for fear that from any quarter our indepen dence or tho integrity of our territory is threatened. Dread of tho power of any other nation wo aro incapablo of. Wo aro not Jealous of rivalry in tho fields of commerco or of any other peaceful achievement Wo mean to live ourllves as wo will; but wo mean also to let live. Wo aro, indeed, a true friend to all tho nations of tho world, because we thcraten none, covet tho possessions of none, desire tho overthrow of none. Our friend ship can bo accepted and Is acccptod without reservation, because it is of fered In a spirit and for a purpose which no ono need over question or suspect Therein lies our greatness. We are tho champions of peaco and of concord. And wo should bo very Jealous of this distinction which wo J havo sought to earn. Just now wo ' should bo particularly Jealous of It, because It Is our dearest present hopo that this character and reputation may presently, In God's provldcnco, bring us an opportunity to counsel and obtain peaco In tho world nnd reconciliation and n healing Bettlo raont of many a matter that has cooled and interrupted tho friendship of nations. This 1b tho tlmo abovo nil others that wo should wish and ro solvo to keop our Btrcngth by self-possession, our Influenco by preserving our ancient principles of nctton. Ready for Defense. From tho first wo havo had n clear and settled policy with regard to military establishments. Wo never havo had, and whllo wo retain our present principles nnd Ideals wo never shall have, n largo standing nrmy. If asked, nro you ready to defend yourselves? Wo reply, most assured ly, to tho utmost; and yet wo shnll not turn America Into a military camp. Wo must depend In every tlmo of national peril, In tho futuro as In tho past, not upon n standing army, ror yet upon a roservo nrmy, but upon n citizenry trnlncd nnd accustomed to arms. It will be right enough, right American policy, based upon our ac customed principles nnd practices, to provldo a system by which every citizen who will volunteer for tho training may bo mado familiar with tho uso of modern arms, tho rudi ments of drill and maneuver, and tho malntcnnnco nnd sanitation of camps. Wo should encourngo such training nnd mako it a means of dlscipllno which our young men will learn to valuo. Tho Natlonnl Guard of tho states should bo developed and strengthened by every means which la not Inconsistent with our obligations to our own peoplo or with tho estab lished policy of our government. And this, nlso, not becauso tho tlmo or oc casion specially calls for such meas ures, but becauso It should bo our constant policy to mako thoso provi sions for our natloual peaco and safo- ty. Moro than this carries with It a re versal of tho wholo history and char acter of our polity. Moro than this, proposed at this tlmo, permit mo to say, would mean merely that wo had lost our self-possession, that wo had been thrown off our balanco by a wnr with which wo havo nothing to do, whoso causes cannot touch us, whost vory exlstcnco affords us opportun ities of friendship and disinterested Bcrvlco which should mako a ashamed of any thought of hostility or fenrful preparation for troublo This Is asBurodly tho opportunity foi which r. peoplo and a government like ours wero raised up, tho opportunltj not only to speak but actually to om body and exemplify tho couusols ol peaco and amity and tho lasting con cord which is based on Justlco and fall and generous dealing. . Ships Our Natural Bulwarks. A powerful navy wo havo alwayi regarded as our proper and natural means of defenso; and It has alwayi been of dofenso that wo havo thought, never of aggression or of conquest Hut who shall tell us now what sort of navy to build? Wo shall tako lcav to bo strong upon tho seas. In the futuro as in tho past; and thero will bo no thought of offenso or of provo cation In that Our ships aro out natural bulwarks. When will tho ex ports tell us Just what kind wo should construct and when will they be right for ten years togethor, if th relative efllc'ency of craft of differ ent kinds and uses continues tc chango as wo havo seen It change under our very oyes in theso last fow months? Dut I turn away from tho subject. It Is not now. Thero Is no new need to discuss It Let there bo no miscon ception. Tho country has been misin formed. Wo havo not been negligent of national defenBO. Wo are not un mindful of tho great responsibility resting upon us. Wo shall learn and profit by tho lesson of every experi ence and evory now circumstances; and what Is needed will bo adequately dono. Great Duties of Peace. I closo, as I began, by reminding you of the great tasks and duties of peaco which challenge our best powers and Invito us to build what will last, tho tasks to which wo can address ourselves now and at all times tho freo-hcartcd zest and with all tho finest gifts of constructive wisdom wo pos sess. To dovclop our life and our re sources; to supply our own people, nnd tho peoplo of tho world as their need arises, from tho abundant plenty of our fields and our marts of trado; to enrich tho commerco of our own states and of tho world with tho products of our mines, our farms, and our fac tories, with tho creations of our thought and tho fruits of our charac terthis is what will hold our atten tion nnd our cnthuslarm steadily, now and in tho yenrs to como, as wo strive to show in our llfo as a nation what liberty and tho inspirations of nn emancipated spirit may do for men and for societies, for Individuals, for states, and for mankind',
