X.-Abroad President Taft's "swan song" message sounds as if the swan had got hold of a lot of things that were foreign to its usual menu, but which were highly relishable to able bodies as weH as moi-ibund birds. According to Cousin Bill about the biggest thing we possess is our for eign trade, notwithstanding that we don't produce enough to fatten our selves, and the biggest thing that has been done for us in four years is Bill's Herculean labor in converting the state department from an "archaic and in adequate machine" into a forceful and well greased engine for the promo tion of American sales abroad at lower prices than the American can take advantage of. He calls particular attention to the fact that in thus cleaning the state department stables of sloth, inefficiency, impotency and other augean filth, he has retained in office a big bunch of ministers, ambassadors, consuls, smaller diplomats and other left-overs from previous administrations. This note of the song is so full-voiced that one is justified in suspecting the mother swan is either trying to mollify the Bull Moose or to save some of her own chickens from the hungry and prowling democracy. However, the message indicates that our foreign business is good and that Uncle Sain is some diplomat all along the line from measly little Liberia to the august court of St. James. Jt is not a state paper that ' will set the archives afire, but it surely is full of cheer to exporters. The Produce Combine's Corner On Food The prosecuting attorney of King county has taken steps to prosecute a Combination of seven wholesale produce dealers of Seattle who are accrued of controlling the prices on fruits and vegetables to the injury of both the pro ducer and the consumer. This combine supplies many of'the retail mer chants of Tacoina and when it was organized one year ago it was frankly stated in letters sent out to fruit and vegetable shippers—those who actually produce the foodstuffs of the Northwest, that because the seven firms in the combine could buy in carload lots, they naturally expected to control or fix the prices. The avaricious custom of Seattle produce merchants have been a by-word with fruit and vegetable shippers in Pierce county for years. In one season, the berry growers of Vashon Island were gouged out of more than one thousand dollars by one Seattle firm; and ever since then the Yashon growers have; preferred to ship their berries through the Tacoma market Jhe activity of the King county authorities will be warmly welcomed by the smaller fruit and vegetable growers of this section of the state for the threat to exclude "kickers" fronj the Seattle market has invariably put the quietus on any action that the growers might have contemplated. Surely the start ing point in the war on high prices is with the agency which invents the hi"h price system, and with market produce, it appears to be the wholesale pro duce combine that invites investigating. What's What? Also the National Cash Register company is under investigation as a trust, as the dispatches voluminously report in the world at large Tn fact there seems to be reason for visioning a faint, rosy dawn of guapicioii about this business. Is it possible that every big concern in the country has decided to have itseJt investigated on trust charges—for advertising purposes? What 1 There are so many eggs in storage in New York, it is said, that dealers fear the prices may drop to ten cents a dozen by New Year's. Let's try to bear it with Christian fortitude. Already four Tacoma stores have the only original and positively genuine Santa Claus on exhibition/ Must be rather puzzling to the kids when they shake hands with the white-whiskered quartette all in one afternoon. Every day we can think of something to say to bring fresh praise to the win ter climate of Puget Sound, albeit some of us affect to scorn it. For instance, the golf enthusiasts enjoy their game all the year 'round, while in the east the links are buried 'neath an everlast ing blanket of snow and ice. Next! Lest you forget, we say it yet: D. Y. Next time the city builds a gravity water system if any of the present commissioners are around they will advocate doing it by day's work with ont contractors.
