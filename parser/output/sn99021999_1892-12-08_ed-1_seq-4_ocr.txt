OF COUltSK-South Omaha is a first- class city as well ns a city ot the first class. Tins council has nt last lot the con tract for removing the election booths from the streets. They never will bo mlssca. IF DAVID B. HILL becomes attorney for the Equitable Life Assurance com pany wo fear that Us policies may be come unsettled. OMAUA'S herd of buffalo will have to 1)0 tenderly cared for if they arc to out live the complicated legislation in which they are involved. REV. JENKINS LLOYD JONES , a Chicago cage minister , has denounced smoking us worse than drinking. A man with such a nutno is liable to indulge any fantastic notions. GENEUATJ BOOTH has stated that the "In Darkest England" scheme is $325- 000 in debt. This is a deplorable exhibit of what promised to bo a most beneficent scheme of practical philanthrophy. Now thnt the sonsou of snow has arrived it is a good thing to remember that the only way to Icoop sidewalks free from snow and ice is to clean them frequently instead of making ono big job of it , THE local weather observer would make a very poor calamity howler , for ho is disposed to look on the bright side of things. Fair weather with stationary temperature wus the prediction for Wednesday. Blizzaids are inscrutable. IT is not pleasant for Mayor Bomls to have so many of his veto messages re jected , but MS ho is usually right , as in the election officers' pay matter , ho can afford to bo overruled by the council , which always tries to Dlay the grand fitand. Tni ! proof of the pudding is in the oaiing. When a paper which claims to too a great circulating medium hns to solicit patronage by circular nnd fills its wants columns , which are supposed to yield a largo part of its revenue , with free advertising , for people who are obliged to advertise , it is proof positive that the concern hns no bottom or else the bottom is dropping out of It. Tun farmers of South Dakota seem to "ho very much in earnest in their efforts to prevent the combination of elevator men , millers and rallroiids from stran gling the anti-options bill at Washing ton. Tholr petitions ought to have some weight , but if it Is true that a paid lobby is worldii ? ngainst them it will take a largo number of petitions toovor- coruo that influence. The attack should first bo directed against the lobby. THIS report of thu commandant at the Soldiers' and Sullori' homo at Grand island indicates some retrenchment in the expenses of that institution and rccommtMirts others. A saving of $5,000 during the currant year ever the preceding - coding year , while the number of in- males hiis boon eomowhat increased , tmealiB well for the manugomont , pro vided that it him not been affected at tlio expanse of the comfort of the old Veterans. Tins proportion of farmers in the state of lown to the total population is very largo. In the census year of 1800 there were 888,517 families in the state , and of thin number 2)5-ll.j ( ) ! were on farms. There were 1-54,093 who owned their farms and 00,787 who rented. The fact that nearly half of the farmers had no incumbranca on their land indicates n condition of prosperity. Real estate purchase and improvements caused nearly 80 per cent of the debt on farms nnd homos in the Httito. FOR ways that are dark and tricks that are vain the young acrobat of the JF , takes the bakery. His latest performance in pleading ignorance ne to how to prepare bids for city advertis ing almost beats his tfumo of bluff on the licuneo notices. Ho actually sent a message to the council asking for speci fications on the advertising proposals when ho know the law us well as the aisoge. lie know that for twonty-flve yours nil bids on city advertising won based on the prlco per equaru ol tar. lines nonpareil. lib liad secured con tracts or ) that-basis through the old council combine for 18SO and 1890 aniJ did not need to jog his memory because those contracts nnd rates are all or roco'rd. But ho wanted a llttlo more free advertising for the Fake Mill ant Jio got it. TO nKPKAL Till ! SlM'Ktl ACT. Senator Hill of Now York hna Intro duced In the United States sonata n bill to roponl tlio silver net under which the government IB required to purchase 1,600,000 ounces of silver monthly. This nrcortls with domoorntlo policy ns defined - fined In the national platform of the parly. It is also In conformity with the view of Senator Sherman , who has sn'.d several times thnt the net ought to bo repealed because It Is nn embarrass ment to the Kovornmont nnd has failed to accomplish whiit wns expected of It in.relation to the prlco of stiver , and very lllcoly of other republicans. Ills therefore to bo expected that Senator Hill will have the support and assist- nnco of the Ohio senator in his olTort to secure the repeal of the silver purchase net , nnd It Is qvilto possible that the bill for this purpose will pass the senate. In the house , however , It Is HUoly to ho chnrp'iy ntita oniz.od. A democratic member of the house wns quoted recently - "tho Sherman silver cently us ssiylnc ; thnt ver law cannot bo repealed" unless the eastern democrats tire willing to glvo us free cotnngo and allow our state banks to Issue circulating notes. The dem ocrats of the south nnd west are bound to have moro money of eomo kind. " This undoubtedly rollocts the Bcntitnnnt of the fiouthcrn and west ern democratic representatives with very few exceptions , and It foreshadows an interesting contest , over the money question within the democratic party. The admission must bo made that the existing silver not , under which the product of Iho American mines Is pur chased by the government , has not kept up the .price of silver. Its Immediate ollect wns to advance the market value of ihe wlnto metal , but this was speedily lost and the prlco wont steadily down ward. Over 5-1,000,000 ouiu'es wore pur- chnsoa during the last fiscal year at tin average price of 91 cents per oum'o , the highest price reached in the year boinjr $1.021 and the lowest 83 cents. While , however , the law has not boon success ful , as it was expected to bo in main taining the orlco of silver , it has boon the moans of adding over $110,000,000 to the currency since its passage , and un less there is some legislation proposed which will continue at least this ralo of currency Increase the southern and western democrats generally will op pose the repeal of the Sherman act. Eastern democrats will not support a measure for the free and unlimited coin age of silver. They are fully committed against that policy by their course at the first session of this congress , nnd there is not the slightest reason to ex pect n change. They will bo found equally persistent , it is not to bo doubted , in hostility to any proposition 'or ' allowing stale banlcs to issue cur- cney. The promise , therefore , seems to be good for an interesting conflict , with the conditions somewhat unfavor- iblo to the repeal of the silver purchase net by this concrress. GREAT CANAL PROJECTS. Tharo are now no loss than three lant canal projects , involving the ex penditure of many millions of dollars , which are soon to bo brought up for the consideration of congro&s. One is the Nicaragua canal and the other ; ! are two different projects for connecting the great lakes and the Atlantic ocean by waterways of sufllcient size to accommo date largo vessels. An effort will bo made to secure 3100,000,000 for the prosecution of the work on the Nicar agua canal. President Harrison is in favor of government aid of this project , and the convention that nominated him also declared in its favor. It is pro posed that the bonds of the company blmll bo guaranteed and that the gov ernment shall control the canal. In his message to congress the president says that "It is impossible to overstate the viuuo from every standpoint of this great enterprise , " and this view is taken by many members of congress as well as by an inlluonllnl portion of the public press. President Harrison's message also warmly commends the plan of construct- iug an American ship canal around the falls of Niagara and the opening of ship communication bolwoon the great lakes and one of the seaport towns. "Wo should not hesitate , " ho says , "to avail ourselves of our great natural'trade advantages. Wo should withdraw the support which is given to the railroads and steamship lines of Canada by a trnfllR that properly belongs to us , and no longer furnish the earnings which lighten the otherwise crushing weight of the enormous public subsidies that have boon given to them. " The presi dent only touches upon this subject brlelly In the course of his discussion of our relations with Canada and treats it rather as an international matter than as one of strictly commercial importance to this country. The Itittor aspect of the question should not bo overlooked. As the president himself says in another portion of hla message , the coast wise trido on the great lakes amounted in 1800 to 23,205,050 tons. The total vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit river that year was 21,081,000 tons , or nearly as great a ton- nutro as entered and cleared from the ports of London and Liverpool combined during the same year , nnd it is to bu borne In mind that the season for the Detroit river was only 228 days. The estimated freight tonnage for the De troit river for the present year Is 25,000- 003 tons , against a little moro than 23- , 000,000 tons In 1891. Those figures givu Bouio idea of the enormous freight tradio of the great lakes and its rapid growth , nnd show that there in ample foundation for the increasing sentiment in favor ol a moro adequate outlet to the sea than is now afforded. It has boon Intimated that n soon us the oiuml which Canada it ) now building at the See is finished , which will glvo that country a wntor- way ot not loss than fourteen foot in depth at any point from Lsko Superior to the sea , the Wolhind and all othoi Canadian canals will bo closed , to Amcrl can shipping , and American commorct going by the St. Lawraueo routu musl bo carried in Canadian bottoms , Till : throat may uovor ha carried out , but i is uudoniablo that in the emergency o war between this country nnd Great Uritain the lakes would bo absolutely controlled by the latter under the proa out conditions. It la said t hat the Brit Ish nnv.v has moro than 150 warships whoso draught would admit , them Into the lakes through the Canadian canals. Hut It U the commercial side of this question that most strongly appeals to the average citizen. In the wosl It touches Interests that nro vital nnd In the cast it Is constantly attracting greater attention. Senator Hill nnd Congrossinm Tracy of Now York are making active preparations to got n bill throuch congress providing for the 1m- mediate construction of n ship canal through that stuto. The proposed route Is up the Hudson river to the Krlo canal nnd thence along the line of the latter to BiilTnlo. The bill will provide for a waterway 200 foot wide , with an average depth of twenty feet. Tha cost of this great enterprise is estimated at SloO- 000,000. Such a canal would moot nil the demands of commerce from the hikes to the sea and would bo available in the event of war. It would put nn end to r.illroad extortion , which is now somewhat feebly restrained during the summer months by the iiiotTeolual old Erie canal with Us little 200-ton boats , which can only carry half tholr capacity of freight on account of Insulllclcnt water. The obstacle which the friends of the project fathered by Senator Hill will llrst meet will bo the question of its nrac- Ucablllty. Among those in the north west who are clamoring for n ship canal are some who S'ty that the route across the state of Now York would bo ti fail ure on account of thonaturoof the coun try , the gront distance , and the supply of water at the summit level. They favor going around the falls of Niagara on the American side and thence into the St. Lawrence. The Chamber of Com- mcrco of Dulutli has called a deep water convention to bo hold In Washington after the holidays , when it is expected that the whole subject will bo exhaust ively discussed by inon who have made a study of it. 01' ' IMMlOltATIOX. Senator Chandler , chairman of the sonata committee on immigration , has introduced his promised bill for sus pending Immigration one year , which it Is understood Is concurred in by the members of the committee. The text of the pleasure is not at hand , but it is presumed that it is so drawn as not to interfere with visitors to ttio World's fair , though it will occur to everybody that there is danger of such a law prov ing troublesome In this direction. Of course the intention is to keep out the immigrants who come with a view to remaining , but will it not bo practica ble for some such to get in on the state ment that they are hero simply as vis itors ? On the other baud will it bo possible to avoid some nnnoyanco and trouble in discriminating ? However , Senator Chandler and the committee of which ho is chairman have thought this matter out very carefully and undoubt edly the bill is so framed as to avoid the possible difficulties indicated. The object of proposing to suspend immigration for a year is understood to bo to avert the danger of nn invasion of cholera. There is unquestionably rea son to fear that the plague will visit this country next year unless the great est possible precautions are taken to keep it out. High medical authorities in Europe are ot the opinion that the disease will bo widely distributed in Europe next summer , and if such should bo the case it would bo impossible to prnvont its coming to this country if unrestricted immigration ivont on. ITowovor rigid our quarantine regula tions might he if wo allowed ordinary immigrants not now prohibited by law to come in wo should subject ourselves to the danger of n cholera visitation that might become epidemic. Prom this point of view , therefore , the pro posal to suspend general immigration until the danger from the pluguo has passed is justifiable. Self-preservation is the first law and it would be a mis take , perhaps a very crave one , not to regard it in this matter. But the motive for suspending immi gration must bo clearly doiiuod , to the end that the world may understand that it is in no sense a concession to the de mand of certain elements for the erec tion of a Chinese wall against Europe ans , however worthy , who desire to como to the United States in order to avail themselves of the privileges and opportunities of American oiti/.onshlp. Hostility to immigration has recently boon assuming a more iiggresslvo * suirlt and there Is reason to baliovothat it has won favor with men who not very long ago were In hearty accord with the un broken policy of the country In this matter. It will not bo well to allow this Foiitimcnt to grow unchallenged , or wo shull in u few years bo placed in a posi tion whore wo muy begin to realize dc- cndonco instead of experiencing pro gress. This country cannot advuhco as it should do and reject the industrious and thrifty of ether lands. Lot ua pro tect ourselves against cholera , or any ether plague by every moans available , but no advantage must bo taken of a possible danger to make a permanent departure from a policy to which the country owes its wonderful progress and pi asperity. Reports concerning the growing wheat crop , while varying greatly in different localities , are generally favorable and the outlooU for next year , so far an It la indicated , leads to the belief that n crop exceeding tlmt of the present year will bo harvested. This is looking a long way ahead , but the men who uiako crop ; a study always 'oogln to predict au soon as the seed is In the ground. It Is stated by the Cincinnati Prlci Current that the visible supply of wlienl has now got above 70,000,000 bushels and will probably go still higher. The tendency , however , toward the enlarge' montof warehouse- stocks is thought tc bo practically ut an end for thjs season , though it way bo sonic time before anj considerable diminution ot those avail able supplies will ba apparent. Thgrc are now about 27,030,000 bushels more of wheat in sight in this country limn at this lime lust yea" , but the ovi- donee points to the fact thnt the actual aggregate supply in the United State : ia about 75,000,000 bushels losi than il was then. This is supposed to moai : that while ttio regular warehouse stocKi indicateuu increase of 27,000,001 bushels the smnllor warehouses nnd the farmers Imvo fully 100,000,000 bushels less than the amount of tholr holdings a , yoarnpo. The tremendous outpouring of wheat during several weeks of the fall has enabled the grain experts to fix their estimates with some degree of nccnrncy. They could hardly concolvo whore It all came from , hut they are now convinced that the farmers were unloading about all they had , which Is probably the true explanation. XO DVl'l.KX 

COUNCIL. The proposition to crealo a lower nnd upper branch of the city council Is slightly premature for n city of our present population. Only cltlos of half a million population can nlTord the lux ury. ury.What What wo do need IB a inayornnd coun cil with moro distinct powers. The mayor should bo the responsible honii of the city government. Ho should have absolute power to appoint the heads of departments for a fixed period and they In turn should have the appointment of their subordinates without Interference by anybody except when charges of mis demeanor or incompotoncy are sustained against thorn. In ether words , the coun cil should have no voice In the selection of executive officers , being purely it leg islative body. The council should , however - over , have the right to Investigate and try appointive city olllctnls for miscon duct and when a majority of that body finds such olUcers guilty nnd declares tholr places vacant the mayor should bo compelled to fill the vacancy. The mayor should have oo-ordlnnto power with the council in the making of contracts , nnd in cnso ho refuses to ap prove any contract which has received the approval of the council the Jonly remedy should Ho in the courts. In ether words , In all ctuea whore contracts are disapproved by the mayor the contrac tors'recourse should bo an application for mandamus. If the objections of the mayor are found to bo frivolous or against public policy the courts will order him to sign th < contract. If , on the other hand , his ' bjcctions are based on legal grounds or In the Interest of good government they will .sustain him and the contract will bo declared void. Under the present system a cor rupt combination in the council or a factional combination can override the mayor's veto and destroy all the safe guards which were intended to bo thrown around the lawrnnhing power. The duplex council would not obviate the defects of the present ayslom. It would not stop the disgraceful traffick ing in p'aces by councilman or the dic tation of unlit apnjintmonts by the threat thnt all thOgood appointments would bo rejected unless the bad ones could bo saddled on the mayor. The duplex council would not do away with the dangerous influence which contractors and 'frnnchiscd cor- poratioiib exert on the council. It would only multiply corruption. The sate and practical reform would bo to Increase the pay of the mayor and councilmen so as to get first class busi ness men of known integrity to devote their whole tlmo to the city's business nnd then t6 center the responsibility for good government.- much as possible upon the mayor by depriving the council of the power to dictate or trade patronage and by giving the mayor's veto of contracts and jobs greater weight than it now has. If con tracts smuggled through Iho council were liable to n chock by the mayor thnt could only bo sot aside by the courts , boodllng would becorao loss ro- munoratlvo to the parties who are in terested in public work contracts or schemes for franchises.

STRIKING CASK IX'OJ.V2' . After more than twenty yours of hard- fought , complicated litigation with the Illinois Central railroad , Chicago has nt last made good her claim to the ownership of the lake front The relations of Chicago to the Illinois Central in the dispute over the lake front are very much the same as these of Omaha with the union depot grounds. The Illinois Central has had actual possession of the lake front for nearly forty years , but the supreme court of the United States has just is sued Its decree that the occupancy of this tract of land by the Illinois Central did not convoy a title. The disputed lake front was really an accretion of earth made and improved by the rn 11 road company at its own ex pense , while the Omaha depot grounds were bought outright by the city and deeded to the company on condition thivt it should forever maintain its pas- Bongor nnd freight transfers at Omaha. This part of the contract never has been compiled with by the road. The so- called union depot has uovor boon any thing but a local station of the Union Pacific. The moro fact that the road has hld undisputed possession would , n the light of tlio recent tloclslon of the supreme court , scarcely constitute a clear title. title.The The lowest estimate of the value of the Chicago lukojfront is $75,000,000 , Some parties pln6'd It us high as $500- 000,000. But Chl9 ? $ > , unlike Omaha , htus dared to bravuvtho displeasure of the Illinois Central-and ether roudn , while Omaha is uj\iys \ ducking under for fear that a few jobbers will bo cut off from special favors in the shape of and rebates-1 TJIH vital question of the hour in South Omaha is whether that city lias 10,000 population. Ttio muddle into which this questjqn has thrown the Magic City U nn u'nJcfHunnto ono for its public schools , for ft loaves a doubt as to whether it is the duly of the county commissioner * or the city council to levy taxes for school purposes , it being an open question whether South Omaha is n flrftt or second-class city. It appears thnt the property owners have not boon required to pay school taxes slnco 1887 , the rovoiluo from the saloons provlngsuf- flciont for the purpose. Now that this source Is no longer equal to the demand the question of authority to levy n school tax arises for the first time. Expressions of opinion by loading clll- zons of the town , as given In Tun IJr.K , show that they nro In favor of having a census tikon : nt once In order thnt It may bo determined whether the popu lation Is in fact 10,000 or moro , and if It is they propose that saloonkeepers shall pay $1,000 instead as $500 , as at present. Tills looks llko a rational way outof the difficulty. The moro sensible thing would bo , however , to tnko the necessary slops for annovatlon to Omnhn.

With liberal appropriations by congress our place can easily bo maintained and American prestige in this particular can be made still more conspicuous. Ail Kxploiloil Theory. CMcagn Tribune. The bombardment of the skies Texas , paid for by the people of the United States through the medium of the national treasury , has ended in failure. The mial test lasted from sunset to sunrise , and the noise of tlio explosion was heard at a distance of thirty miles. Some clouds gathered over head , but they yielded no rain , though a trace of moisture was observed at a point in the vicinity. Everybody who witnessed the experiment , except General Oryenforth nnd his backers , seems to have been convinced that the effort failed to help the theory. Those who are committed to it claim to the contrary , and state it to bo the intention to experiment in South Dakota next year. It is fair to presume that this will bo done if a fresh appropriation bo made , and not other wise. The chances for such an appropriation are not flattering. Possibly the country has seen the last of these abortive attempts at raiumakiug for the present. -
