RETURNED TO EARTH. RETURNED TO EARTH. Interment of All that Pertained to the Mortality of Thos. a. Hendricks. His Body Consigned to a Vault Embowered With Brightest Flowers—A Magnificent Funeral Accorded the Dead Vice-President. INFLUX OF VISITORS. Ikdiakapoms, Ixn., December 1. The mortal remains of Thomas A. Hendricks, "the fifth Vice President of the United B tabes to die during his term of office, were conveyed to the tomb to-day. The event was made memorable in many respects by the presence of a tremendous concourse of people from all parts of the Nation to wit nefts the simple rites which preceded the in terment. The presage of inclement weather on the day of the funeral, which was given . yesterday, was verified only to the extent of a wintry, leaden sky, and a thick atmos phere doting the early hours unusual to this latitude. The heavy fog of the pre ceding afternoon still bung over the city when the day broke, but as the hours wore on lifted somewhat and became less im penetrable. The early morning trains on all the rail ways brought delegations from the Na tional Capita and ail the leading cities of the Union, together with an influx of peo ple from all the interior cities and hamlets of Central Indiana and Illinois. 

DISTINGUISHED MOURNERS. The Cabinet was represented by Secretary of btate Bayard, Secretary of the Interior Lamar, Secretary of the Navy Whitney, Secretary of War Endicott, and Postmaster General Vilas. The Supreme Bench of the United States was represented by Associate Justices Hat th ws and Blatchford. . The U. K. Senate was represented by Sen ators Edmunds, Allison, Pugh, Harris, Conger, Blair, DolphVest, Beck, Camden, Vance, Jones, Voorhees, Payne, Palmer and Harrison. - The committee representing the House of Representatives was composed of W. R. MorrisonJ. Blount, H. A. Herbert, W. 8. Bolman, W. M. Soringer, W. P. Hepburn, g. B. Ward, W. W. Phelps, J. J. Kleiner, Thomas Ryan and P. Dunn. The number of active and ex-members of the lower Souse present In addition to those named was very large. The Governors of Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and Kentucky were present, attended by their staffs and numerous State officers. Major General Schof ield was the chief repreHentative of the U. 6. army present. Ex-President Rutherford B. Hays and General William T. Sherman were distin guished guests, the latter accompaning a delegation from St. Louis. 

SCENES ON THE STREETS. The official and other notable delega tions were met on their arrival by local ' sub-committees and given tickets of admis sion to St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, to be present at the church services, and as signed positions in the funeral column. The train arrivals swelled the multitude .. on the streets to an extent to impede the ordinary progress on all the chief thor oughfares. Washington street presented a black mass of humanity hours before the services were entered upon at St. Paul's, and long before the passage of the column ' the windows of ita business blocks were filled with occupants. The eye rested on a waiting multitude, which occupied appar ently every vantage point along the broad thoroughfare. - Perhaps the most effective draping is that at the post-office building, where wide bands of black cover the wall space of the first story, leav.ng only the doors and win dows .visible, not a line nor spot of white ra ievea the entire building. ' The County Court-house, where the re mains lav in stato until Monday evening, and the State House, are tastefully draped, out in much less elaborate "style, ow ing to their much more massive ex teriors. A striking feature of the drap ery of buildings is the almost universal use of white material as a border) or in bows- or rosettes upon the black! Le gends are very few. One btl&iness house on Washington street has the words, ' I am free at last" the last words of the dead Vice President. Portraits of the deceased,, all shrouded in black, are profusely hung in windows. The general effect tells in mute eloquence of the high respect with which the OOOole Of TnH i H n o YM-il i q r-tra A leUow-townsman, and of the tender sympa . thy which moves them to thus try to miti- gate the grief of her upon whom the blow -of this National bereavement has fallen with heaviest force. ... 

LAST LOOK AT THE DEAD. At 9 o'clock Mrs. Hendricks entered the tm "?roer lat leave-taking, accompanied by he' brotfeifr and Mrs. Morgan. The or- deal was most trying, and the desolate WCnnan seemed to be ntfcerlv nrrwf.rnr.fvV clinging to the last to the clay so soon to be hidden forever from her view, and impress ed with the life-like appearance of the dead.' She desired to preserve this last scene, so, late as it was, she sent for a pho tographer to take a picture of the casket. Be fore he arrived delegations from distant cities began to come, and were permitted to nasi) thnmvli nnH view the remains. While the photographer waseengaged at his work the members of the 'abinet, the Judges of the Supreme Com and others from Washington entered and were unfortunately detained a few minutes by the process. It was 11 o'clock when the casket was replaced and the stream of visitors again passed by and out through the side door. Shortly after this the pail-bearers arrived. The draped hearse and the carriages for the family and friends were marshaled before the door, and the jinjurBuoiu were maae ior tne FINAL REMOVAL OF THE BODY. This was done without further leavetak- mtc. - be police and military keot the cnri- ous bu always respectable mass of people out of the way, and the little cavalcade moved quietly with its military escort through denselv lined streets to the Cathe dral or bt Paul. SERVICES AT THE CHURCH. The casket was borne into the church at 11 :40 o'clock, the vast congregation having already been seated, with the exception of the immediate relatives andthe church ves try.

Thirteen pews to the right of the central aisie were reeervea ior tne lamuy, wniie the vestry and members of the local com mittees occupied pews in front to the left. The pew occupied by the dead Vice-President in his lifetime was the tenth from the front, to the left of the middle aisle when facing the altar. It was distinguished by its comrtleta envntnritnpnt iti hlhr-k blnth. and the Tact that it was unoccupied. The church .is a modest brick structure. square and oblong, but commodious with al, seating nine hundred people, but hold ing within its walls, in this instance, fully one thousand. Its sharply slanting roof is supported on brick columns forihihg part of the side walls, but is also sustained by two tiers of arches which spring from the right and left centers of the auditorium, meeting at the apex of the roof. The in terior is naturally dark, being lit by dor mer and narrow side windows all in stained glass, a large field of the same filling in the space over the altar in the rear of the church. The main and side doors were heavily draped in black. The interior deco rations were plain but effective, consisting of a festooning of crape from the central arches, the pulpit and chancel rail having a drapery of white and black intermingled. The central arches were completely drap ed, and the sides of the church were panel ed in black. On the front interior walls of the church were two large designs of the Greek cross, in the rjrevaUinir sable color. The dark shrouding of the interior was re lieved by only three floral pieces, all hand some in design. On the altar .inside the chancel rail was a plain cross composed entirely of white flowers, contributed by the ladies of the parish. On either side of we aitar was a sneai or wneac un tne iace of the pulpit was a column of white roses, with purple flowers at one side, forming a ladder. At its base was the inscription "September 19, 1816V" and at its top "No vember 25, 1885." On the summit of the column was perched a white dove. The de sign bore the Latin sentiment, "Stat magnt Komims gtorta." ineaesign was tne gut of the Ohio Club of Cincinnati. In front of the lectern was the national shield, "con tributed by the Yondota Club, of Toledo. This design had a background of green, faced with red, white and blue flowers, with the exception of a central monogram com posed of the letters "T. A. H." in pink, yel low and white rosebuds. The interior of the church and chancel was brilliantly ngnteo. When the casket had been placed in front of the chancel rail, the choir sang the an them, "Lord, let me know my end." The lesson for the dead was then read by Rev. Dr. Jenckes. This was followed by the singing of the hymn, "Lead, Heavenly light" by the choir, the audience joining. Rev. Dr. Jenckes, speaking from the lec tern, delivered a touching sermon from the following text: "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, what soever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there pe any praise, tuna ontnesetnrngs." ran. When the speaker had concluded. Mrs. Doner, of Chicago, sang "Rock of Ages," the Bishop closing with prayers and bene diction. The casket was then lifted and borne from the church, the audience re maining seated. iranng tne progress or tne runeral column from the house to the church there was a slight drift of sleet in the air which contin ued throughout the period of services in the CathedraL In the church edifice, THE PLACE OF HONOR. Was accorded to ex-President Hayes-hls full beard and hair showing the whiteness of advancing years. He sat immediately in the rear of the pews occupied by the vestry and reception committee. In the pew di rectly in his rear were Secretary Bayard and Other members of the Cabinet. To their left were seated the committees from the U. S. Senate and House of Representa tives, wearing flowing sashes of white over their right shoulders, closed at the left side with rosettes of black crape. Immediately in their rear were the officers of the U. S. Army, in full uniform. On the north side of the church were the Governors of the Slates present, with their staffs. THE FUNERAL PROCESSION. The bells of all the citv churches betran tolling when the remains were taken from the house, and continued their pealing dur ing the continuation of the church rites ana while the procession was on its long march to Crown Hill Cemetery. There was very little delay in the movement of the great column when once the distinguished people who had composed the church audi ence had been assigned their carriages.

The latter was drawn by six black horses, wearing the black paraphernalia worn by the animals attached to the funeral car which bore the remains of General Grant to the grave. On either side of the hearse was a guard from the Indianapolis Light Infantry, carrying their guns at the position of "reverse arms.'' An escort of citizens, composed of Oscar B. Hord. William Henderson, Gen eral Fred Knefler, Aqnila Jones, James H. Rice, V. T. Malott and General James R.

The third division was composed of all non-military organizations. It was pre ceded by the local Irish-American organi sations, followed by the marching political clubs, which had taken part in the recent Presidential campaign. The fourth grand aivision was made up of local municipal organizations, including the Fire Department, with their steamers neavuy orapeu. The column took arp its line or march at 12 :4 p. m., but its progress was retarded in the business district owing to the block ading crowds, which far outnumbered the moving column. It proceeded slowly through the great masses of people on Washington street. The military organi zations attempted to march with comnanv front, but were repeatedly compelled to break into columns of fours and move by the flank. The carriages were driven three abreast. The movement was slow, the hands playing dirges, making the pro- i tmn bu uuiw ujiuw-b unperceptiDie until the 'column merged upon Merid ian street, a broad and handsome avenue leading to the entrance to the beautiful Crown Hill Cemetery. The cortege moved on uy me oanosume nomes oi roe weajtny, whose windows and sidewalks were filled with great throngs standing respectfully. The broad thoroughfare stretched out into the country beyond the limits of the city, and when the head of the column came within sight of the cemetery, a mile dis tant, the Indianapolis Light Artillery be gan to fire rhinute guns, which was con tinued until the hearse approached the grave. Shortly before the column entered upon the final stage of its journey the sleet be gan to fall more sharply, accompanied by a cold wind. The carriages containing the mourners and notable participants were all closed against the inclemency of the weather. THE COLUMN ENTERED THE CEMETERY Under a splendid stone arch, completed yesterdav, and was the first to pass under it. Windmcr throuch a thick Growth of beech and maple trees, the military divis- I ion came upon a large open view, and approaching THE OPEN GRAVE On the Hendricks family lot, which occu pies the most commanding view of the grounds, turned to the left, and then again to the right, finally completely encircling the tract of which the Hendricks plat forms a part. It constitutes historic ground for Indiana. To the east rises the marble shaft erected to the memory of General Jeffer son C. Davis. Iininedintelv opposite lie the remains of Oliver P. Morton. A little to the north is the grave of General E. R. 8. Canby. To the northwest another piece of rising ground is dotted with simple head stones of seven hundred of Indiana's soldiers - who lost their lives on the battle-field. The Hen dricks lot is graced with a simple column Of polished Maine granite, thirty feet high and seven feet at the base. It was erected three years ago, when Mr. Hendricks was deemed to be in failing health. The lot contains the grave of Morgan Hendricks, the only child born to Mr. and Mrs. Hendricks, who died in 1851, in his third year. This grave was completely imbedded in flowers by the friends of the sorrowing widow. The grave opened to deposit all that was mortal of Thomas A. Hendricks is the counter part of a mausoleum, having been encased completely in stone. Look ing into the open grave, to the view there was only a bed of evergreens, smilax and cut flowers, the stone inclosure having been lined with these beautiful emblems. When the hearse had halted near the lot the casket was borne to the grave, the ven- eraDie tlisnop JvuickerDacker preceding it and readings the verses for the dead, and after the lowering: of the casket. Rev. Dr. Jenckes read the committal service, the isishop closing with prayer and benedic tion. Only the widow and her supporters approached to the grave, the remaining multitude standing off, silent spectators. The head of the funeral column entered the cemetery at 2:46, the hearse reaching the grave at 2 : 54 o'clock. The closing rites at the grave were performed a few minutes after 8 o'clock. The procession was one hour and five minutes passing a given Jioint, and the rear of the column had only eft the business portion of the city a few minutes before the first division "had ap proached the cemetery. SCENES AT THE GRAVE Were impressive. There was no special re straint upon admittance to the cemetery. ana several nunarea persons naa gatnerea about the grave before the funeral party arrived. The body of the procession had disbanded after passing beyond the city limits, and only the military, with the mounted escort, entered the cemetery. The space reserved about the grave had only been defined by placing a line of plants and evergreen twigs, which was quite suf ficient to protect from intrusion. Just be fore the head of the column came up the crowed was pushed back further to give ample room to the friends, who were as signed the side of the grpxe from where the column approached. This order was cneeriniiy ooeyea. When Mrs. Hendricks, leamnr upon the arm of Mrs. Korean, stepped upon 'the matting placed alongside the grave and be- lore tne casxet was removed rrom the hearse, she paused to look down into the last resting place of her dead, only to see a picture of Iovliness in its lining of green leaves and flowers. Then she turned to the grave of her child, which had been made glorious with a covering of smilax and flow ers, and read in letters of white his baby name, "Morgie," and on the top of the grave, on a neia oi wnite, in purpie letters, the sentence. "And a three-fold cord shall not be broken." The tender love which she discerned in this treatment of her treasure by sympathetic friends, seemed to give her courage ior tne last oraeai. tier glance then caught the monument decorated with the National flag enveloping a life-like portrait of her husband facing the grave, and she turned with the bravery of heroism to witness the last rites. There had been no rainfall for a brief period, but the sky was lowering. Just as the coffin was placed beside the grave tnere was a might sprinkling oi ram, caus ing many to recall the old saying, "Bless ed are the dead whom the ram rains on." The Columbus Barracks Band at this point played the American hymn and the read ing of the service followed. Mrs. Hendricks only leaned more heavily upon Mr. Moi gan, resting ner oeaa at last upon nis shoulder, but her self-control was bravely maintained. While the service was read the Congres sional Committee, the members of the Cab inet and other distinguished visitors, stood upon the other side of the grave. The words of the clergyman were now and then drowned by the sound of the minute guns, which kept firing until after the interment was over. When the coffin had been lowered into the grave by the colored assistants of the undertaker, and there was nothing remain ing to be done for the placing of the stone, and the filling of the grave was to be at tended by the cemetery force there was a moment's pause, and tne silence was broken only by the minute gun. .Then Mrs. Hen dricks and the friends of the family passed the still open, but not repellent grave, and took their carriages. The people who had waited so respect fully then flocked to the grave to get o nearer view. The military order. Forward march, started the soldiers homeward, the carriages rapidly rolled away, and the dis tinguished dead was left alone. Among those who have borne something more than the ordinary sorrow of this be reavement is the rector, Mr. Jenckes. Ii v a -observed that during the reading oi h s brief address his voice more than once failed, and when, at the close, he pronounc ed his farewell, the word became almost b wail of grief. Tears were seen to start in many eyes, and sobs were audible in differ ent parts of the church. This feeling wa intensifed as that thrilling solo, "Rock o Agoe," was sung. ., - We are under obligations to the entn prising and sprightly Evening Post.

Reform in the Civil Service to be Enforced. —Suspension of Silver Coinage— Polygamy to be Crushed—Conservative Course on the Tariff Question Advised. Washington, December 6. The message is quite a long document something over 20,000 wordU. It deals at length with all important public questions. The President gives very positive expression to his view concerning civil service reform, and insists on it being carried out in the public ser vice. He thinks it as yet an experiment where experience is constantly suggesting improvements. In the matter of tar iff revision he deprecates such sweep ing action as might cripple the na tional industries, but favors an equalization, and such reductions as the question of revenues will admit. Upon the silver question he reaffirms the views he ex pressed at the time the unlimited coinage men of Congress addressed him their letter. He favors either an immediate suspension of coinage or giving discretion to the Presi dent to suspend it When in his judgment the public interest demands it. Upon the Indian quest'ott tho President occupies about the position of Commissioner At kjils. He favors liberal attempts to render the Indians self-supporting, and bring them as rapidly as possible under the operation or tne law, line otner citizens, tie routes de cided ground on the Morman question, and favors vigorous measures for the extinction of that evil. He insists upon the Chinesa receiving the full protection of the law. In the matter of internal revenue, he suggests that changes might be made which nil! make the law less annoying.lt is said that ha favors considerable reduction of taxation. All the subject nannd above are treated at length and in Very positive terms. In call ing attention to the death of the Vice Pre ident, Mr. Cleveland takes occasion to re commend legislation on the subject of the succession. He ftlno sets forth the necessity of providing: more definite legislation sv erning the counting of the Electoral votes. His position in regard to a new navy, coast defense and internal improvements have not yet become known, but it is believed that he v'll recommend a very liberal course in all these matters. The Presi dent devotes considerable space tu the ag ricultural interests of the country, and urges Congress to do all in its power to aid in their development. It is not expected that the message will go in before Tuesday. THE 

MORMON TROUBLE. One Battery of Artillery Ordered to Fort Douglass—Uneasiness of the War Depa tment. Washington, December 0. The War De partment has recently received such re ports from its officials in Utah regarding the very unsettled condition of affairs in that Territory, growing out of the en forcement of the laws against polygamy, as to cause some uneasiness, but no alarm. The recent shooting of a Mor mon by a U. S. Marshal created a great deal of excitement among the Mormons, and some apprehension was felt at Salt Lake that tnere would be an uprising among them. A battery of artillery was recently ordered from Omaha to Fort Douglass, which is situated a few miles from Salt Lake City. This movement, however, was not particularly on account of any fear of a Mormon rebellion, but had been in contemplation for some time. The force now at Nort Douglass consists of a full reg lncntof infantry and a battery of artillery, ind is under command of General McCoolt. in the event of trouble in Utah all the troops in the Department of the Platte, .-insisting of about 3,000 men, could be con centrated at Fort Douglass in a very few aours. No serious trouble, however, is ap prehended by army officials. Big Fire at Indianapolis. Indianapolis, December 6. One of tbe largest fires that has visited Indianapolis in years occurred at 2 o'clock this after" noon, entirely destroying the linseed oil manufactory of J. P. Evans & Co., the only industry of the kind in the city. The milis contained about 100,000 bushels of flaxseed, 25,000 gallons of oil and a considerable quantity of oil cake. A stiff oreeze was blowing from the west, causing the fire to burn with great fierceness, and for a time there was great dauger of the flames spread ing to adjoining property, in which :vent a great conflagration would have followed. By bard and skillful work on the part of the firemen, several of whom wore slightly injured, the flames were con rued to the building in which they origi nated. The building contained all the ma chinery used in manufacturing linseed oil. The building, valued at $30,000, was totally destroyed. The machinery, worth 45.000, s damaged to the extent of $35,000, and the flaxseed is nearly a total loss, making the entire loss not less than $150,030. Tbe in surance aggregates $102,500.

How Can the Destruction and Extinction of American Game Be Prevented? Mr. Ernest Ingersoll, in a paper just published by the American Geograph ical Society, makes a startling record of the extinction of wild animals from this continent by the settlement of the country. Much of this lamentable de crease of animal life was unavoidable. But Mr. Ingersoll does well to descant upon the ruthless waste of one of our most valuable resources. Only twenty five years ago the great plains were covered with huffaloes, and Mr. Inger soll says: " I myself have seen steam boats halted on the Upper Missouri by swimming bands of these linest of wild cattle." But the extension of the Paeilic railways has been made the occasion of a needless extermination of t' -m. The elk, moose and deer-have si u-- - ed a similar fate, until now it is said tnat the elk, which eight yei'- ago re seen in thousands on the .ins of the Sweetwater and in the Wind River Mountains, have practically been diiv en to their last refuge in the Southern Rocky Mountain plateau. Mr. Ingersoll shows that this baleful disturbance hi the natural order of ani mal life is not limited to the lnnd alone. Seals, which once disported in the At lantic surf along this coast southward to Cape May, have retired to the New foundland or Labrador coast. The habitat of the oyster on our Atlantic coast has seriously -decreased. The feathered tribes, especially the prairie chicken, the wild turkey, ducks and all game birds, have been sadly de pleted, and still the slaughter goes on almost unchecked. Mr. Ingersoll suggests that an arrest might be put upon this uncalled-for destruction Dy making and enforcing "a law which should permit so-called sport to be indulged only by a selected few who had proved their capacity for common sense and self -restraint."

Probably fatal. A shrewd piece of rascality is reported from Union Township, Hancock County, where four farmers have lost $250 each at the hands of a scoundrel. Tbe fellow was selling lightning rods and took notes for $25, which now turn up as notes for ten fold that amount. The farmers of that community are indgnant over the swindle, and swear that they will take vengeance on the scapegrace if be again makes his ap pearance. An old man named William Cooper was fatally injured at the Ohio Stove Works, Eiyria, by the stove at which he was work ing bursting, a piece of which struck him on the head.

They were standing on the track between two sections of a freight on the L, B. & W. road at the crossing of the two roads, when one section of the train suddenly backed, .striking the two men, throwing them under the wheels, and crush ing them almost into pieces. They both died within a few hours. Welty has a wife and four children. Burgher was a young unmarried Swede.

The Supreme Court decided the Daggett habeas corpus case on the 1st Jndges Owens, Fol- lett, Atherton and Johnson were on tbe off A thortni. nnsl Ta r.n.. ww.n na bench when Chief Justine Owens aunonn ed that the decision of the Court was that Edward Daggett be discharged from custody. No dissenting opinion was spoken, and it is therefore understood tbat Judge Johnson, Republican, agrees with the three Democratic Judges in the case, and that the decision is unanimous.
