A Friend's Greeting. I'd like to 4e the sort of friend that I you have been to me, I I'd like to be the help that you've been always glad to be, I'd like to mean as much to you each minute of the day As you have meant, old friend of mine, to me along the way. I'd like to do the big things and the splendid things for you, To brush the gray from out your skies and leave them only blue I'd like to say the kind things that I so oft have heard And fee! that I could rouse your soul the way that you've stirred. I'd like to give you back the joy that you have given me, Yet that were wishing you a need I hope will never be I'd like to make you feel as rich as I, who travel on Undaunted in the darkest hours with you to lean upon. and I'm wishing at this Christmas time that I could but repay A portion of the gladness that you've strewn along my way. And could I have one wish this year, year, this only would it be I'd like to be the sort of friend that you have been to me. —Detroit Free Press. JUST A MATTER OF PATIENCE. Des Moines is viewing with disgust the number of packages of Christmas booze that arrive by express. It is noted that one shipment of over 400 packages arrived In one day. What of it? And why not? Des Moines, of course, could not the expect that closing saloons would stop the thirst of graduated boozeflghters who esteem a Christmas drunk a per sonal liberty and a great joy. And counting Des Moines' hundred odd thou sand inhabitants, 400 packages of booze isn't much. Also Des Moines need not worry overmuch about the quality of the squirrel whiskey that these fellows are getting. That's their lookout. If they skin the linings off their stom achs it only means fewer packages next Christmas when many of them will have gone where the craving for logwood and tobacco juice and prune juice doesn't affect them. About so many will get the stuff, about so many will get drunk and be thrown into jail or buried from the hospitals and the like. Nobody can stop the real and geunine boozer who prides himself upon his degradation. He must go on to the finish, with rare exceptions. The point is that thousands of men are better off because the saloons are prone, not that certain whiskey suicides are committing hari kari with squirrel whiskey. And, at that, they axe not getting much faster results than they might get with Somebody's Ten Year Old. There's headache and poverty and heartbreak and death and murder in it all whether it was made in a cellar in Kansas City or in a private distillery down in Kentucky. Des Moines will just have to lef them go. They are on their way. It's only a question of time and not a long time at that. It is a question of wait ing until the poison works. That 8 all. WHEN WE WENT TO TOWN IN BOBS. Pretty sharp weather this, with the mercury flirting with zero and the crisp snow crackling under foot, pretty brisk weather, but Christmas weather, the old fashioned kind of Christmas weather that was favored when we were boys and girls. Times change, however. In those older days snow at Christmas was con sidered a trade necessity. Nowadays good sharp weather with dry roads are the hope of the merchandizes People do not change much except as they adapt themselves to the progress of in ventive advancement hut the automo bile has changed the ideas of merchan disers from "good sleighing" to good automobile roads. In those old days it was a day's journey to the big town with a span of Morgan bred horses ami the bob sleds. If you remember we took the wood rack off the bobs, cleaned the snow out of the wagon box and put that on the sleds, filled the box with clean oats straw, piled in three or four buffalo robes and a quilt or two as a prelimin ary. Then after the team had been hitched and the crowd was ready we carried out the bricks and the big stone that mother had been baking in the cook stove oven and wrapped them Bound Advfee. iii & hcrss or two where "What are you doing, Thoma»?" mother and the girls could put their the father of the young man on 14 tfcem.

The breath of the horses changed to rapid puffs of steam and that of the pas sengers gathered In white fllligree upon the heavy buffalo where it was drawn up close about their shoulders. A cold day but a merry one. The younger boys pleading cold feet got out to run behind the sled and the driver slipped away from them by a simple loosening of the reins for no boy was ever born who could keep his place with old Bet and Fan when they had their heads. 40* A. How th^y begged before they were permitted to catch the"-®nd -board and pull themselves in. How they panted and their eyes shone and they cuddled down under the robes warm, full blooded and happy. There was lots of fun going to town in a bobsled those days. Still and cold the fields stretched away on either side spotted with the- cattle stringing out from the straw stack to the cornstalks. The smoke from the farmstead chimneys stood straight as an iron bar toward the zenith. The willow hedges were marvels of frosted beauty. And in the cold silences the sleighbells rang keenly musical jls we went to town In the bobsled. Every generation hW. its pleasures. We are past the bobsled era. We run out the six cylinder, fix the chains and set side curtains. We whirl at railroad speech to the town thirty miles away and looking at our watches pleasantly remark that we took an hour and ten minutes to cover the distance. The buffalo robe has gone with old Bet and Fan but there is plenty to keep us warm. And arrived we buy "nick nacks" for Christmas that mother would have held up hands of holy horror over when we went to town in the bobs. Still -we haven't changed much. We are the same folks with the same ties and the same affections and impulses. The boy that drove the auto is as good a boy as he who tooled old Bet and Fan and the rest of the folks are like those who sat under the buffalo robes of another genera tion. It doesn't matter so much how we go as thkt we go together. Not the bobs and the horses and the rushing cars matter but the folks they carry, And men and women and families are the same and the children laugh and the young folks smile and love rides across the miles in an auto as 1t used to do when we went to town in the bobsled. THE BUSINESS FIELD. In contrast to the usual experience at this season, there is no general lull apparent in the commercial world. December, with its preparations for inventorying, is, ordinarily, a month of diminishing activity, except for the holiday trade yet in the present In stance the tendency is steadily toward expansion rather than contraction. This fact is made clear not only by the tenor of advices from all leading cen ters, but also by the statistics of bank exchanges, which measure business volumes. Thus, clearings at the prin cipal cities this week were 64.0 per cent in excess of last year's, and 39.8 per cent larger than in 1913. while payments outside of New York showed gains of 29.4 and 20.5 per cent, re spectively. 1 Why so much. fuss over the pack ages thus sent in? If all the booase and beer shipped in to Individuals were placed beside the amount of drink the saloons purveyed in one day it would be as gills are to gallons. Why so much worry over the old soaks who will drink anything from Jamaica ginger to sulphuric acid? Why not more joy over the fellow who has quit and who is paying for real coal in stead of slack, getting groceries on time where he couldn't have got trust ed for a plug of tobacco and whose family is looking forward to a real Christmas? Moreover, other barometers reflect the same trend, gross earnings of rail roads reporting for the first week st December disclosing an increase of 15.6 per cent over 1914, and it is significant of the remarkable improvement in the position of the transporting companies that these interests continue to make provision for needed equipment and extension. In view of the frequent complaints of shortage of rolling stock, however, the accumulation of about 3S.000 in the number of idle freight cars last month is considered surpris ing. Further light on the enormous traiTic movements is shed by the most recent returns of foreign commerce, merchandise exports from the thirteen principal customs districts last week being valued at fully $98,400,000—a total only slightly below the high rec ord attained in the third week of Oc tober. Holiday demands are exceeding ex pectations in the dry goods markets and the trade is ra-uch encouraged by the developments in this quarter. Owing largely to tb- firmness of raw materials and the seriousness of the dyestuffs situation, prices are steadily advancing and Jobbers generally re port satisfactory profits for the half year ending Dec. 1. Salesmen return ing from their territories In the south and middle west tell of a volume of business far in excess of. last season and prospects are for even heavier trading during the late winter and early spring months. In all lines prices are strong, with an upward ten dency, due to the steady advance in leainei. The latter continues active, tho some branches of the jobbing trade are commencing to feel the effects of the approach of the holidays and in ventory taking time. Thmout the en tire market the statistical position favors holders, as many buyers, not withstanding recent liberal purchases, are short of goods. No Tim* isr "How about Your New Stenogra pher?

TIMES-REPUBLICAN, MARSH ALLTOWN, IOWA: DECEMBER 20,1915. Topics of the Times The town of Manning has broken into the lime light with promised per mits for the saloon after Jan. 1. How ever it is going to be pretty hard to establish a "state of Manning", now adays. Dubuque made it once but that was a long, long time ago children. The Washington Press is encourag ing Clifford Thorne to run for con gress. The state would hate to loose Mr. Thorne from his present efficiency on the railroad commission but Clifford would make a mighty good Iowa con gressman. And the First needs a good congressman. The present administration sheds ultimatums as easily as it rained last June and July. The selection of St. Louis as its con vention city is a death blow to any hope that the party would favor na tional prohibition. It couldn't be done in St. Louis and any delegate get away uninjured. Perhaps if we had that army of a million men and a navy big as all out doors we'd be a little less prolific of ultimatums. As it is an ultimatum ranks with an unacknowledged mort I gage. I So far as that is concerned there were a lot of weddings on the same date that are likely to have more ef feet on the future of America than the presidential affair. Some men who Are strong for a cur few law never spend an evening at home. That Wilson family is a mighty nice I one but it wouldn't need a dray to bring home prizes from a beauty show, The idea of good road building is like that of barn building. Don't use a 2x4 where the strain culls for an 8x8. This road business is a very ordinary matter of simple, common sense and experience. However, Mr. Ford will be in the lime light again- when he gets back home and -cuts the price of a car to somewhere around $300. They'll take notice of Henry then. 

IOWA OPINION AND NOTES. "The young man's first mild worry over Christmas is, what does she want? His second and great worry is, how to get it," reminds the Hampton Chronicle. "An optimist," says the Sioux City Journal, "is\. saloon man who thinks the Iowa supreme court can be In duced to invalidate-the Clarkson law." "People who are complaining 'be cause President Wilson's message to congress is tame never had the oppor tunity to find fault on that score with any of the messages of Roosevelt," says the Webster City Freeman Tr«»une-, fJU&S The Iowa Otty Anoan inquires, "Which is the better—the republican method or pavtog as go and laying up a surplus or the free tra'de method of squandering all along-the line and of soaking the people, for more taxes." "A congress perpetually in session will mean that the American idea of government is a failure," declares the Iowa City Citisen. "If we have statutes that are blue laws why are they not repealed?" de mands the Carroll Herald. "Every law should be enforced, and, if we have any that are not suited to present day con ditions, they should be repealed." Says the Waterloo Times-Tribune: "Speaking about bartenders taking up farming after Jan. 1, they ought to be a success at raising corn, rye and hops." Iowa Newspapers
