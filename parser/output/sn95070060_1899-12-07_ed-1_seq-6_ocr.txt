linn snh talk on auy othor toplo than ordi nary domestio eoncornH but I Haw cer tain thlnga I had formed a plau for tho night that roqulrod nemo courage Reoalllng Lu oottaH expression of tho morning that I might expoct a ropetition of tho expe rience which if a dream hud hud tho appearance of a most formidable reality I prepared to profit by tho warning In a wny sho hnd oortulnly novor meant that I should Satisfied that If thoro was ny truth lu my suspicious thoro would bo an aot performed in this house to night which if seen by mo would for ever Hottlo tho question that was agitat ing tho whole countryside I mado up -my mind that no lockod door should in terfere with my opportunity of doing so How I effected this result I will relate in a fow minutes After on evening more solemn than tho day but characterized as the two jxrovious ones had not boon by a long talk with tho two girls together I wont to my room in a state of seeming fatigue that evidently mot with the approbation f Lucotta who had accompanied mo to my door with a lighted candle I hear you had Bomo troublo with matches last night said she You vrill find thorn all right now Hannah must bo blaraod for some of this care lessness Then as I bogan some reas suring roply sho turned upon mo with a look thut was almost fond and throw ing out hor arms cried eutruatiiigly Wont you givo mo a little kiss Miss Buttorwortk Wo have not given you tho best of welcomes but you oro my mothers old friend and sometimes I feel a little lonely I could easily boliove that and yet 1 found it hard to embrace her Too many shadows swam between Althcas chil dren nnd myself Sho haw my hesitancy a hesitancy I could not but have shown oven at tho ritk of losing her confldeuco nnd puling slightly dropped her hands with a pitiful binilo rou dont like mo sho said I do not wonder but I was in hopes you would for my mothers suko I have no claims myself That you must bo suro I am thoroughly convinced of You are an interesting girl and you have what your mother had not n se rious sido to your nature that is any thing but displeasing to mo But my Jtlssos Lucotta are as rare as my tears I had rather givo you good udvicoj and that is a fact Porhaps it isas stronga1 proof of affection as any ordinary caress might bo Perhaps sho murmured but sho did not cnoourago mo to givo it to her notwithstanding Instead of that sha drew buck and bid me a gentle good sight which for somo reason inuda mo sadder than I wished to bo at a crihis demanding so much nerve Then sho walked quickly away and I was left to fnco tho night alone Knowing that I should bo rather weakened than holped by tho omission of any of tho little nets of preparation with which I am accubtomed to call my spirits for tho night I went through them all with just as much precision as if I hud expected to spend tho ensuing liours in rest When all was douo ami only my cup of tea remained to bo quaffed I had a little struggle- with myself which endod In my not drinking it at all Nothing not even this com iortablo solaco for an uiihutisfactory day bhould htand in tho way of my bo ing tho completo mistress of my wits this night Had I known that this tea contained a boporifio in tho bhupo of a littlo harmless morphine I would have found this net of self denial much easier It was now 1 1 Confident that noth ing would bo douo whilo my light wns burning I blow it out and taking a caudle nnd matches in my hand softly opened my door and after n moment of in ten bo listening btepped out and closed it carefully behind mo Nothing could be btiller than tho houso or darker than tho corridor Am I watched or am I not watch ed thought I and for an instant stood undecided Then seeing nothing and bearing nothing I slipped down tho ball to tho door beyond inino and open ing it with all tho euro possible stepped inbido I know tho room I had taken especial aioto of it in my visit of tho morning I knew that it was nearly empy and that there was a koy in tho lock which I could turn I therefore felt more pr lot s safo in it especially us its window was uudarkened by tho branches thut huug to thickly ucross my own casomont shutting me in or seeming to ehut me in from all communication with tho ontsldo world and tho unknown guard ian which I hud been assured constantly at t endod my summons That I might strengthen my npiritH by one glluipso of this sanio outsldo world before settling down to tho watch I hod set for myself I stepped softly to tho window and took ono lingering look without A holt of forest illumined by a gibbous moon met my eyes nothing else Yet this sight waswelcomo nnd it was only af tor I had boon struck by tho possibility of my own figure being neoni at tho cahomaut by somo potwibla watoh or in tho shadows bolow that I found tho hardihood necessary to withdraw Into tho darker precincts of tho room nnd begin that lonely watch which my doubts and expectations rondorod neces sary Thin was tho third I had boon forced to koop and it wns by far tho most din mal for though tho bolted door bo twoen mo nnd tho hall promised mo personal safety there prosontly roso in somo fnroff placo a smothered repeti tion of thut sumo rat tup tap which bad sent tho shudders ovor mo upon my sudden entrance into tho houso early In tho morning Heard now it brought a weakness upon mo which I did not know oxistcd In my nature and whilo with this recognition of my feminine susceptibility to impressions there camo a certain prido in the stnnchnoss of pur poso which lod mo to rostraiu all ac knowledgment of it by any recourse to my whistlo I was mora thun glad when oven this sound ceased and I had only to expect tho swishing noise of a skirt down tho hall nnd that steulthy look ing of a door I had taken tho precau tion of loavlng It camo sooner than I oxpected camo just lu tho way It had tho provlous night only thut tho porson paused a momout to listen beforo hastening back Tho silence within must lmvo satisfied hor for I hoard a low sigh liko that of relief boforo tho stops took thomsolvos back That thoy would turn my wuy gave mo a momentary concern but no I had too completely lulled their sus picions or let mo bo faithful to all the possibilities of tlio caso tuey put per haps too much confidence in tho powdor with which thoy had seasoned my nightly cup of tea for them to doubt that I was soundly tishiop in my own quarters Three minutes after I had followed thoso steps as fur down tho corridor as I dured to go for sinco my lust appear ance in it a candle had been lit in the main hull and faint as was its glimmer it was still a glimmer into tho circle of which I folt it would bo foolhardiuoss for mo to stop At somo 20 paces then from tho opening I paused and gave uiybolf up to listening Alas thoro was plenty now for mo to hear You have heard tho sound wo all havo heard tho sound but fow of us in a dosolato structure such as I stood lis teuiug lu and at the hour nnd under tho influences of midnight Tho measured tread of mon struggling undor n heavy weight and that weight how woll I know it as well us if I had soon it as I really did in my imagination It camo from tho adjoining corridor from tho room I had found no oppor tunity of entoriug that day and it ap proached surely and slowly tho main hall near which I was standing but in such n position it would bo impossible for mo to seo anything if thoy took tho direct courbo to tho head of tho stairs and so down as there was every reason to expect thoy would I did not dare to advance howovor so conccntrntod my faculties anew upoii listening till sud denly I porcoived on tho great white wull in front of mo tho wall of tho main hall I mean toward which the opening looked thooutliuoof a shadow puss and roalied that tho candle hud been placed iu such n position that tho wall nnibt receive tho full bhadow of this pibhing cortego And so it wan I miw it hugo dihtorted mid suggestive beyond any picture I over behold tho pabbiug of a body to its loug homo car ried by hlx anxious figures four of which scorned to bo thoso of women But that long homo I Where wns that likely to bo It was a questiou bo im portant that for a momout I could think of nothing but how I could follow them without running tho risk of dibcovory Thoy hud reached tho head of tho btuirs by this time and I heard Miss Kuollys low linn voico enjoining sileuco

to the small portion of our citi zens who are agin tho government on Its Philippine policy It is giving too great dignity to their opposition to call thorn traitors they are simply chumps The democrats declare tho presidents mossago an noknoledgment and plea for greed This might bo interpreted that thoy concede to Mr McKinloy tho offlco as long as he wants It How otherwiso could hia greedy cravings bo satisfied Dr Gntllng tho famous gun expert has invented an automobilo plow which It Is claimed can do the work of eight men and 12 horses How much this remarkable maobino may coast is not

would look ob though there was an ample field for temperance reformers and a detach ment of W C T U lecturers should soon be enroute Those who have been clamoring for an increased currency circulation should derive some consolation from the annual report of Secretary Gage of the treasury department who Bays that Tho total comage during the year 1899 was 180855076 gold 108177180 silver dollars 8254700 subsidiary silver 9400877 minor 950010 This means an inciease in the circulation of coin of about 2 per capita which added to that already in circulation places the circulation per capita another notch higher tluin auy couutry in tho world The decision of the United States bu premo court iu the Addystone pipe case is a severo ono to the much talked nbout trusts and monopolies aud it begins to look as though another important ques tion was being settled without the aid of Mr Bryan It is a shame to thus take away Mr Bryans campaign thunder with which he bos been ramming his batteries for notion but the people in terested will probably be satisfied even though the reform is brought about under President McKinleys administra tion This decision means that it is probable that the present federal law govornlng trusts is sufficient for the people when they havo a competent at torney to prosecute This decision while not of itself sufficient to restrain all trusts from doing business opens the way for thoir prosecution by the trade interests affected and further gives to congress tho power of strength ening aud improving the law for such cases provided To Curo Ia
