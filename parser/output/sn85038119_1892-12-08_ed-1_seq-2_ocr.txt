Lewis Green, Editor Proprietor Subscription Price. $150 St Ajtdrew Jackson's Day comes before tbo Inangration. It must be celebrated, The comet, tbe Republican party and the Logan Gas Co. went out at about tbe same time. Eiela's comet, is supposed to be with other obsunre luminarils in the place or its origin, Biela-fcldt. J at Gould, the millionaire, is dead and buried. He will not live in song nor in poetry. The wrecker will be longest remembered at the firosides of desolate homes he made, his memory a horrid spectre in the night of selfish speculation. The grief of his kindred is all that is worth respectful regard that attach es to him. The world moves on, and is none the better that he passed over it. His accumulated millions, pqneezed from the honest toilers of thiscountry, grasped from the clutch of equally as unscrupulous public public robbers did him no good, and will be no blessing to those who succeed to it. Give the "Wean" a rest. Bro. Cullman of the New Lexing ton Hearld and who is chairman of tbe Columbian Fair Committee on mines and mining, Gov. Campbell's right hand man, and Cleveland's constant and consistent supporter, has cast his eye upon the antagonists of Camp bell and Cleveland, and in his last issue, muses and amuses thus. "It is amusing to observe how much certain Democratic editors are in love with Psasident-elect Cleveland at this time. We have reference to those who would like to secure Mr. Cleveland's autograph to a postmaster's commission, or other federal appointment i Prior to the National convention these same 'cheeky ducks" were loud in theirdenunciation of Mr. Cleveland, declaring that "he could not be elected;" "That it was political suicide to nominate him;" "That he was nothing but a Mugwump," and most infamous and abusive of all, "that Mr. Cleveland was a scound rel." The most rabid Republican in the land was not as veliemerit and untruthful ot the President-elect as these gaily office-seekers who now . ask special favors of tke administra tion, notwithstanding the fact that a large majority of the Democrats are opposed to their receiving any political recognition. And Mr. Cleveland should see that the will of the majority prevails, and that political tricksters are relegated to inocuous desuetude. The weary should be given a rest Congress. Congress met on last Monday. There has been no business transact ed yet, and no matters of consequene will be considered until after the Holidays. The Presidents message is a tame production for a State Paper. It is merely a synopsis of the reports of the various departments. Toe gush displayed over the pro gress and prosperity of the country is anti-deluvian. It was current re publican campaign oratory. The country is progressive and proper ous because the American man is superior to calamity, and rises in his strength, and goes on up in spite of the load of taxes imposed on him by Republican legislation. This is aprogressive country. Mr. President we have got out of the woods and have good farming land before us. ME. 

OUTHWAITE SCOEESHIS POLrnOAL FOES. AnaJTells What the Democrats Must and May do. A number of well known Demo crats from Washington attended the Democratic jubilee, where there were fire works, bands of music, marching and speeches in recogni tion of their recent victory. Among the speakers was Representative Joseph H. Outhwaite, of Columbus. Mr. Outhwaite was received with enthusiastic applause, and in point ing out the work of favoritism done by the recent Republican Congress, said that at the dictation of a selfish, unscrupulous and dangerous lobby, they changed the tariff laws so as to enable their favorites to make large fortunes every year through tribute levied upon the people. Upon a hypocritical pretext of protecting American labor, they placed in the hands of many em ployers, to some degree, the power lo say when the laborer should have work and how much he should get, and at the same time robbing him of a part of his daily wages in eccret The monopolists' tariff bill "was framed and passed to corner the markets of tbe country for cer tain manulacturers, to enable them to get higher prices for their pro ducts and to guarantee them such profits as they thought they ought to have. The people were to pay tributes to still further enrich the monopolists, so that the monopo lists might take care of the peo ple. Another iniquitous measure they pressed through the House, the Da venport election bill. Its purpose was to take from the people the control of their own elections and j place them in the hands of millions of the party bosses. Its object was lu kuuuiui i as luu uiu jiai l ujiuii us seat af power and hold the people within its grasp whether they ap proved its policy or not A Con gressional election followed this session of Republicanism. Every district that had been robbed of its representation in the Fifty-first Congress returned, with an increas ed majority, a Democratic mem ber. In 1890 thecylone of the people's indignation sweptaway a considera ble portion of the Republican edifice. This year it has come back for a part of the foundation. Once more and a hole in the ground will be all that will be found. But these reckless po litical leapers did not heed the warn ing of 1890. They assembled in Na tional Convention at Minneapolis and instead of confessing their man ifold sins and wickedness and re penting of their evil ways and hum bling themselves before the people, they reaffirmed their adherence to their mischevous policy and all that it signified or embraced. On that platform they weic going to carry every Northern State but Nevada. They came nearer losing every Northern State but Vermont. In half a dozen States it has required the official count to determine which candidate has won the electoral vote. And there is my own Ohio. On Thursday, November 10, news flash ed across the county that Ohio had gone Domocratic, that her electoral vote would go to Grover Cleveland. Amazement, another morn risen up on mid-noon. Well, the offictel count will give us one electoral vote out of twenty-three, and that is something to be proud of from a State that has cast its solid electoral vote for every Republican Presid ent Next time the Democratic Committee in Ohio will not rest sup inely on the verge of victory. But besides carrying all theNorth era States, the Republican managers were going to carry several Southern States, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia. Alabama and Virginia all were theirs until the people answered then boastful -laims at the polls with enormous Demo cratic majorities in the aggre gate some hundreds of thou sands. When the people were complain ing of the evils of McKinleyism, Republican leaders of the House said: "Well, what are you going to do about it? The law has come to stay, the Senate stands between you and its repeal." Now even that LAST BULWARK OF MONOPOLY HAS been swept awat. The people have committed to the Democracy all the power necessary to rcadopt the principles of our party in nation al legislation. A wise and patriotic use of that power will insure Dem ocratic ascendency for many years to come. A deficiency in the income from which we must pay the ex penses of the nation already threat ens us, yet we must reduce the bur dens of an unequal and unjust tariff without shaking the foundations of our industrial system. We must so legislate upon this vital subject as to leave manufacture uncrippled, remove unwise restriction from com merce and relieve agriculture from unfavorable discriminations. Above all we must emphasize the principal that no American citizen shall be made to pay tribute as the slave of another to the amount of his earn ing for a day or an hour." One Man Who Got nn Inheritance That Vfai Not Meant for Him. "Spealrinfj of coincidents," said Edgar E. Hill, who, according to the St Louis Globe-Democrat, addressed the Little Hatchet club in the corridors of the Laclede, "reminds me of an experience I had p. couple of years ago. 1 was bookkeeping in San Francisco, when I received a letter stating that my uncle, John C. Hill, of New Haven, Conn., had left me a legacy of five thousand dollars. I immediately went to New Haven, was identified, and, after due legal formali ty, the money was turned over to me and I placed it in bank. 'The very next, day I met my uncle, whom I supposed was dead. lie had just returned from a six months visit to Scotland, the land of his birth. The fact quickly developed that the John C nill who had died was an entirely different man, and that the legacy was intended for another Edgar E. Hill, rrho had failed to show up. I had crossed the continent, wasted two months' time and secured a snug sum of money only to find that I had mistaken another man's pocket for my own."

Tnn slow progress of the thirty fe male students at Yale is very discour aging. They have not learned the yell yet. TUe new electrical laboratory to bo erected at Johns Hopkins will be a roomy one-story structure of corru gated iron, illuminated from tho roof by large skylights. Trffi oQcial count of students at Cor nell university has just been completed, showing 1,544 now in attendance. This figure is higher by 100 than at the cor responding period last year. Social life at Vassar presents inter esting phases to the 130 new students who have this year ended its freshman class and are being initiated in the va rious clubs and societies of the students. Bishop Hurst, of the Methodist church, is industriously pushing the movement for the establishment of the American university in Washington. It is his hope and expectation that an en dowment fund of $10,000,000 will be acenred. 1893. Harper's Magazine. ILLUSTRATED.
