Robert Buchanan's well-written farce- comedy, "The Strange Adventures of Miss .Brown," which Americans have read about for two years, was 'first 'seen in this city last night at the Grand. The play is' an other one of those innocent and extremely laughable pieces which England turns out now and then without rhyme or reason, and which for the very extravagance or the nonsense result in what the press agents generally term a screaming success. The fun begins when Herbert Sparling, as Captain Courteney, appears In Mrs. O'Gal- lager's dress and is admitted to a girls' seminary as M!s Brown. The veteran John Rogers has displayed all the fine taste for feminine loveliness of an Ed Rice or a Charley Hoyt In selecting the girls who make up the hoydenlsh pupils of this seminary. They are ull model pudIIs until tha disturber Miss Brown is admitted to their exclusive resort, after which the devil Is to pay. In. some respects the school scene recalls the laughable situations In De Wolf Hopper's "Dr. Syntax," except that the Miss Brown affair is far more amusing. Sparling is an expert on the piano, and sings ballads in a way to capture the hearts cf the seminary girls as well as the audi ence. He is certainly a most delightful en tertainer. His love episodes with the dif ferent maidens who ore strangely attracted to the new pupil furnish continuous merri ment, at times the audience growing even hilarious. As a farce-comedy "Charley's Aunt" Is not to be compared with this production, and It Is easy to believe the stories of its great success In the larger cities. Jn addition to sparling there are several fine opportunities for other mem bers of the company, and their work was well appreciated. The play is remarkably ireo from any suzestivtness or vulgar double entendre, which is somewhat of, a surprise. Judging from the rare opportuni ties of the suolect. "Miss Brown" will re- ma'n here to-night and to-morrow, with a edneaday matinee. Xordlcn. Concert Off. The Nordlca concert which was billed for English's Opera House to-night has been declared off by Dickson & Talbott, upon the receipt of information that Mme. Nor dlca Is 111 at Cincinnati. Tho following telegram was received at 9 o'clock last night from F. P. Wright, Nordica's man ager, at Cincinnati: "Nordlca does not 'sing to-night, account illness. Will not be, able to sine to-morrow night. Doctor says will bo all right for Dayton Wednesday night. This was the first Information Messrs. Dickson & Talbott had of the Illness of Mme. Nordlca. and It is their belief that she must have taken suddenly 111 last night. The dispatch was dated at Cincin nati at 8:43 p. m.. and it is probable that the performance at. Cincinnati had begun when It was discovered that Mme. Nordlca would not be able to appear. The sale of seats'for the concert here had not been large. '-but the announcement that the concert will not take place will be a disappointment to the lovers cf hlch- ciass music, Mesrrs. Dickson & Tal- r.ott say that ail tickets will b redeemed eitner at tne Pembroke Arcade ticket of fice or at the box office to-night. Park "A Boy Wonted." . It is quite an expentlve company and a clever production that Clay Vance and Harry Blaney have put out this season and which opened for three day yesterday at the Park Theater.

PEARL-STREET AFFRAY.' William Iloacli and Ills Brother-ln-Lnw Have a Fight. About 9 o'clock last night the patrol wagon made a hurried call to 307 West Pearl street, where It was reported that a man was being murdered. Officers Mc Casey and Butcher had arrested William Roach and his brother-in-law, also named Roach, the former with a slight knife wound in the thigh and the latter with a dangerous contusion on the head inflicted by a stone thrown by William Roach as the concluding argument In a family row. Wil liam Roach was brought to the station and slated for assault with intent to kill, while his more dangerously wounded brother-in-law was turned over to Dr. Elsenbels for surgical treatment.

WILL MAKE STEEL' RAILS. Reason the American Company's Plant Shut Down. When tho American steel works closed down Saturday night none of the officers of the corporation were In the city and the superintendent could give no definite rea son for the shut-down. Daniel G. Reld, of Richmond, came to the city yesterday and explained that the reason of the closing was that the company is getting ready to manufacture steel rails and in order to do so has to make a number of improvements and put in various new machinery. "When we bejfln making rails." said he. "the working force will be increased to five or six hundred men. Our market Is as good as could be expected. thouRh the prices are a little off. We have disposed of all the steel billets we could get out," HOW IT WAS RECEIVED. (Concluded from First rage.) have a far higher regard for Mr. Cleveland had he simply announced that the United States government was opposed to the cause of Cuban liberty and sympathized with Spain's effort to crush the revolution. The message will not make a particle of difference one way or the other so far as the revolution is concerned. If the soldiers of Gomez and Maceo realize that tho meas ure means that the United States will not raise a finger to stop Weyler's butcheries they will fight with that terrible energy that is born of despair. Cleveland's talk about autonomy only shows how little he really knows of tho real state of affairs. The idea of autonomy Is dead. Scarcely any one In Cuba, even among tho Spanish themselves. considers it seriously. The Autonomist party went to pieces months ago. For us now there are left only the two alternatives Independence or exter mination." Manuel A. Recclo de Morales: "I resigned my position as a leader of the Reformist party, which is similar in its aims to the Autonomist, because I became convinced that absolute independence is all that can save Cuba," Dr. Henry O. Seayas: "The President s message is decidedly unsatisfactory to both sides. The Cubans have a right to expect more, but the consolation remains that he treats Spain with the scorn which she de serves for her weak and cruel rule. Toward the end the President promises that at some future time his attitude will be clearly defined. Let us hope then, that he will act In accordance witi the expressed wish of the American peopU" Dr. Rafael Navarro, of the Cuban sani tary 'corps: "Cleveland does not say any thing in his message; he does not mean to hay anything. It is words, words, and only words. My hope 13 In Congress." Mrs. Carlos Manuel Cespedes, widow of the President of Cuba during the last war: "Perhaps Mr. Cleveland Is really more friendly to Cuba than his message would indicate. From motives of policy, perhaps, he has refrained from expressing the sym pathy he really feels." , Delegates Estrada Palma and Joaquin Castillo "declined to be interviewed, but de clarod through their secretaries that they would issue an official statement within a short time. THE 

LONDON PRESS. British Editor, Thoajrh Not Enthnsl- nstic. Commend the Message. LONDON, Dec. 8. All of the newspapers this morning havo editorials on President Cleveland's message. Most of them regard the . message as one of rather minor im portance, except so far as it concerns the Cuban question, to which phase tho bulk of the comment is devoted. The Dally News, the Liberal organ, says of tho Cuban portion ' of the message: "President Cleveland's argument Is clear enough that no country possesses the right to foster a perpetual source of trouble, and that Spain must either grant autonomy or sell. Spain, however, will probably re fuse to do anything of the kind. Her pro verbial pride will be much hurt by Ameri ca's Interference. She will be disposed to Insist upon her right to wallop her own niggers as long as she pleases, and Europe, being very sensitive Just now on the sub ject of the Monroe doctrine, Spain will probably be influentially supported if she holds out. We hope she will not prevail because autnomy is best for Cuba and best for Spain." The editoral in the Times Fays: "The tone and spirit of the message are worthy of all praise. It is a pity that the modera tion and balance of mind which Mr. Cleve land has Just displayed were not more con spicuous last year when he startled two continents by a menace of war. If the Venezuelan question had been handled as Mr. Cleveland now handles the Cuba ques tion, he might have averted the disruption of tho democracy and have kept Bryan and Bryanlsm in their previous obscurity. The present message gives the soumlest ad vice in the most unexceptional language, nor. can tho least complaint be made of the character of the warning addressed to Spain. It Is not Improbable that Spain will take offence, but clearly Mr. Cleveland Is actuated by friendly feelings and Spain will do well to acquiesce. Otherwise, the way will be clear for the Influence represented by Mr. Call's resolution In the Senate yes terday. If Spain closed now with Mr. Cleveland's overtures it would be difficult for tho McKlnley administration to steer a new course." The Chronicle. Liberal, in common with other papers, congratulates both countries on the prospects of the adoption of a gen eral arbitration treaty. It says: "It Is clear that tho Cleveland administration means to conclude the great reform before resigning office." On the proposed Cuban pettlement the Chronicle says: "We . be lieve the time has passed when the Cuban Insurgents will accept any solution plac ing Spanish officials over them, even nomi nally. There is no mistake, however, about the warning President Cleveland addresses to Spain, and Spanish statesmen should be aware that the Derhocratlc government la far more pacific and conservative In its foreign policy than the comin.tr Republican government is likely to be. Spain has to face a humiliating dilemma, but she could not fight the United State. for twenty-four hours. Therefcro she should sell Cuba quickly, but he would be no friend of the United States who would advise her to buy Cuba," The Standard. Conservative, says It thinks that Spain had better accept Mr. Cleveland's friendly counsel, as Mr. McKin ley is not likely to be less exacting than Mr. Cleveland. "The Monroe doctrine." says the Standard, "is making great strides. It is a large, bold policy, not quite free from danger. Fortunately, ,aa far as England is concerned, the prospect of the arbitration treaty makes tho risks of trou ble small. Altogether It Is a dignified and able message." $421,718,965

BOLTERS IX VITED. Silver Republican Senators Asked to Attend a Caucus To-Day. WASHINGTON. Dec. 7. The Republican members of the Senate to-day decided to hold a caucus at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. When the determination was reached an interesting situation at once presented Itself. The silver Republican Senators who bolted the St. Louis plat form and ticket were an unknown quantity In their political affiliations and whether or not to Invite them to attend the caucus was an undecided matter. Many confer ences-were held. Senator Chandler, of .New Hampshire, being particularly active in recommending that the bolters be notified of the caucus, which is practically an In vitatlon to attend. Senator Chandler took tho position that the votes of these men would bo needed In passing a tariff bill. Senator Quay, it is understood, took the sam view. It was finally concluded that notices should be sent them as before. This result placed the burden of action on the silver Republicans. They conferred until late In the night to Fettle on a line of policy. Senator Dubois, of Idaho, is. . or was. secretary of the caucus. He will re sign this place, as he has been more active than many of the others In the recent cam paign and was one of the most urgent in advocacy of a bolt at St. Louis. There has been a tendency among some Republicans to pursue a conciliatory course toward the silver Republicans, especially as a number of them have declared in favor of protec tion, and Senator Mantle's paper has been quite positive in this direction. It is not believed that either Senators Pettlgrew, Mantle or Cannon will attend the caucus, although they would noz be required to in dicate their views. The purpose of the caucus is to outline a programme for the session. EARLY CROP OF PLU3IS. McKlnley Will Have About 200 Tost- offices to Bestow Tiext March. WASHINGTON. Dec. 7. During the first few weeks after President-elect McKlnley assumes hi9 duties he will have the privi lege of making about 150 nominations of presidential postmasters. The Senate dur ing its session beginning to-day will have about 400 cases up for action. During the recess of Congress there have been 1C4 nom inations of postmasters which must now be submitted to the Senate for confirmation or rejection. All nominations to fill va cancies caused by the expiration of com missions or postmasters at presidential oi flces during this month and January and February must also b submitted, together with nominations for alout fifty lower- class offices which will be raised to the presidential rank on Jan. 1. These swell the list to about 400. Every Congress, how ever, leaves some cases not acted on. These are returned to the postmaster general as not confirmed. Judging from past records It is probable that there may be in the neighborhood of half a hundred of these unacted-on cases where disposal will be left to Mr. McKlnley. The remainder of I fie list io uo consiaerea oy jir. Aiciviiuey during the early weeks of his administra tion will be made up by about one hundred officers whose official commissions expire during1 the first three weeks of jaarch. Practically all or the offices where com missions expire between now and tho in coming of the new administration are of the smaller class. Money Spent on Armenians. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.

HANNA THE PRESIDENT 3IAKER ENTER TAINED BY COL. J' S HAY. Chalrmnnnhlp of the Committee on In- nucuurntlon Arrangement De clined by Mr. WoodwnrU. NASHVILLE, Tenn., Dec. 7.-Robert L. Taylor, called Governor-elect of Tennes see, cannot take his seat and bo inau gurated as Governor, under the Constltu- tlon of Tennessee, on Jan. 15, when the gubernatorial term of Peter Turney ex pi res. This Is worrying his followers and office-seeking admirers a great deal. Gov, Peter Turney will hold over a month, at least, if not two months. When George N. Tillman, the Republican candidate, files his notice of contest, which he Is now prepar ing, under the Constitution, Governor Tur ney will hold over until his successor has duly qualified, and Bob Taylor must be qualified by the Legislature after a thor ough investigation of all the frauds charged. Rob Taylor's silver committee Is at its wits' end to find some loophole of escape. Taylor is in the same boat that II. Clay Evans found himself In two years ago elected on the face of the returns. The Democratic Legislature passed the cel ebrated contest law for the sole purpose of finishing Lvans, which they did. Now the shoe pinches; tne contest law. so friendly and welcome then, has now become the Nemesis of the party. The law has not been repealed, and cannot be until the Legislature meets, and Mr. Tillman will file his notice of contest before that time, and under the provisions of that law, wnlch is now welcome to tho Republicans and such a thorn to the Democrats, the contest must be conducted rigidly.

It will be my pleasure to give my heartiest support to the gentleman named and to aid in every possible way to make the cere monies the most brilliant and memorable In history on the Inauguration of Presidents."

KEIFER'S VIEWS. He Thinks -Mark Hnnna Would Prefer a Tarn In the Senate. NEW YORK, Dec. 7.-Ex-Speal:er J. Warren Kelfer, of Ohio, who Is In the city. says he thinks Senator Sherman will be a candidate for re-election. "Suppose he is called to accept the treas ury portfolio?" an interviewer asked. "I know nothing about Cabinet slates. but I do not think the Senator will go Into the Cabinet. My opinion Is Mark Hanna would rather be Senator than to accept a cabinet portrono. l nardiy tnink fie will care to become a Cabinet officer. I am op posed," he continued, "to the inngiey bill because of Its ad valorem duties. We should return to specific duties and a discriminat ing protective tariff. I believe that If It is necessary to have a high tariff on certain products and Industries in order to foster them we should not hesitate at all. On other articles we should have the tariff high enough to pay the expenses of the government. I do not believe we should call an extra session and prolong the tariff agitation ror months, probably for a year. because It retards business greatly. People do not know what to do until the tariff question has been settled. TAMMANY FOR PEACE. W illing to Foriclve the Gold-Standard Men Who Doited. NEW YORK, Dec. 7.-Not for years has there been so large an attendance at a monthly meeting of the Tammany society as there was to-night.

Bourke Cockran and the other members of the Tammany society who had bolted the Chl cago ticket for the nominees of the Indian apolis convention. This is the language Mr. Croker is reported to nave used: A mu nicipal campaign must not be fought on national Issues. To win. we must have the aid of all our friends. Keep the doors of Tammany wide open. Let us only try to control local politics and not men's con science." The death of Colonel John R. Fellows, for many years a. member of the society, af forded an opportunity ta extend the olive branch to the lolters. and Thomas F. Grady presented a tribute to the dead, which was s I read upon the records. The sentiment of the meeting was stronKly for conciliation of the seceding Democrats. Major MeKInley'a Visitors.

Disease is like a devil fish. It h&a one body with many diverging arms. The tnn who is grasped by one of the e ami may possibly act see that it is di rectly connected . with the others. Nine diseases out of ten start froa the same cause. The arms are all attached to the same bodr. Impure blood reaches out in all directions over the human body. It stretches out a tentacle and grasps one orgun or another. It attacks the liver and the sufferer is said to have "liver complaint" It attacks the lungs, and he is said to have consumption. It reache his kidneys, and the doctors say he has kidney disease and treat his kidneys. These so-called diseases are only sytaptosia. They all reach back to the same cause, and that cause is impure blood. And impurt blood is usually caused by imperfect diges tion. The way to kill a devil fish 1 to at tack its head and body. It might be killed by cutting off its arms, but it would take a lor time. While one was being cut off, others would fasten themselves on the ictira. The way to cure disease is to cure ths cause of the disease to go right at th head of the matter. There is no use treat ing symptoms. Disease cannot exist in a body that is perfectly pure and full cf healthfull, strength-givinjr properties. It can be made pure by the ue of Dr. Pierce's great medicine, the ' Golden Medical Discovery." It is because of its wonderful, blood purifying and invigorating qualities that this remedy is so marvelous in its ef fect oa diseases of the throat, bronchiil tubes and lungs. It cures ninety-eight per cent, of all cases of consumption. It 6topa lingering, chronic coughs, and builds up those who are " run-down," emaciated or debilitated from any cause. It makes found, firm, healthy flesh. It makes people stronjr. It invigorates the blood, and stimulates the action of every organ in the body. The three thinjrs that it does are the three things that must be done in every case before health can come. It steadies and strength ens the nerves; makes digestion rrfect: makes the blood pnre and rich. There is nothing in the world just like it. There is nothing in the world that is "Just as good," though dishonest druggists will sometimes tell you so, for the sake of the profit tue7 will make on inferior articles.
