Va. c Thursday, December 5, 1907, i 11 j The President has Congress on bis j hands again, and the indioitions are that it will be an elephant. , The Secretary ol the Navy, Mr. Metoalf, wants Congress to spend some . $70,000,000 in building battleships. Toe country would be a great deal . better off if the government would | spend that amount io maki g good ? roads throughout tbeUuited States. 1 Senator Foraker, ol 0jio, has announced himseif as a candidate for the Republican nomination for ttje presi- f dency. Of course he doesn't expect ? to get it, but he'll probably succeed in ? b-.aung Talt out ot it.

Fatal Wreck at Shenandoah Junction A disastrous and fataj railroad wreck occnrre>l about 1.30 o'clock la?t Moadav morning on toe BtUimore & Omo Railroad a few hundred Tarda west of Shenandoah Junction. Train No. 12, the ill fited Diquesne Limited?the B A 0 s fastest ptesenger train?was involved, and three of its passengers were killed and a dozen others iojared. The accident occurred in a peculiar way. Freight train N > 2697 was ou the siding jest above the J unction, waiting a signal to proceed, which would not be given it nntil the Limited should pass. Freight train No 1823. with E-igineman Elwards at tbe throttle aod Firemao Kayser on tbe tender, came in on the same track behind No. 2697 and plunged into the rear cud with great force, throwing the ciboose to one side and hurling several other cars over ou the main track. Ju-?t at that instant the passenger. train caune along at tre mendous speed. The engine struck one of tbe freight cars a glancing blow, and tbe combination baggage and smoking car had its front end smashed in, bur both went on ahead, being stopped within a few hundred feet, tbe coach derailed. Toe dav coach plunged into the freight wreckage with full force, and the shock was so fearful that it was throve into the held north of the track*, where it lay upon its side. Two Pullman sleepers that were in tbe rear of the train were derailed *"d nn? wa<* badlv broken at the lor ward end, bat their occupants were cot seriously injured. Toe passengers in the diy coach bad a frightful experience Three were instantlv killed?W. L F Hoff man, aged 36 yeare, and his daughter. Nellie, 15 yeare old, of Btltimore. and a man whose name wan given as A. Beveridge, of Ctmeron, W. Va , though hie identity has not yet been fully establia&e 1. About a dozsn othera were ioj ired, ol whom three o ily remain in ibe ho-pita! at M trtiasburg. None of the traio men waa serious ly hurt. The engine of the express train waa but eligUtlr damaged, and ite occupauts were unharmed. Conductor Henry Hill and Flagmm Powell. who were in the caboose, miraculously eaotpei injury wiieo it waa etruck by ttie engine, an 1 the engineer and fireman of No. 1823 jumped when they saw that a collision was in* evitable. After the first shock was over, the occuptnts of the shattered p-iessnger coacn began to mtke tu?ir wav out of the death trap. By the light of m?tch e? aud burning paper they extricated themselves, until the train men came with lanterns to help them Toe dead were laid to one eide and the bidly injured were carried out aud sheltered ia the Pullman cats Within an hour a relief train with half a dozen physicians had b?en sent out from Mirtinaburg and wrecking trains summoned trom Brunswick, Cumbsr lurid aad Mtttiusburg. All of the killed and injured were taken to Mirtinsbarg, where the dead were prepired for burial by ^V. 3. Wilea apd the injured were cure! for at the King's Diughter's H^pital. By five o'clock the dead and injured had been taken to Mirtinsburg, aud those who were lucky enough to escape bad been transferred to another train aud taken on to their destination. A large force of worauieo begtn to remove the wreckage and repair the tracks, an 1 by nine o'clock one track was clear'ed and trains got by. Many persons from Shepherdstown, Charles Town an l t te surround ing country visitel the scene of the accideat and watched with interest the work of clearing up the wreck The engineer of N > 1823 said that nis engine was only m >ving at six or seven miles an hour when he struck the other train, but from the loots of the locoantive, which was simply a mi-8 ot shatterei iron and tangled pipes, and from the way the freight hod hdAn t.hrOWII about, it ii mOSt ceruin-tbat ha was goiog much faster It was do gentle bump that caused Huch a wreck. A coroner's inquest was hell in Mtrtinsburg Mori lay night, before Coroner K.ine It. Wis shown that Conductor Bill whs asleep in the caboose of train No 2697, and that Flag nan Powell was *l*o in the ca boose, after having placed torpedo-* on the track behind him. E igineer E I wards, of No. 1828, declared that the trouble was cause 1 bf the failure of the air-brakes Although he did bis best, the air would nqt work, aud his tiain gathered speed after it passed the summit at Boobs When he fouo<f that be could not stop his train and that it wascercain to c?use an accident, be blew his whis'le to warn the men iq the caboose ahead of him I and then he and his fireman jumped. Tne coroner's jury rendered a verdict that the accident was due to negligence of Conductor Bill and Fltgman Powell, of No 2697, an i E igi Deer El wards, of No 1823. The members of the jury thought that the conductor and fltgman should have warned the traio following them and that the engineer should have put on bis brakes soooer than be did, as his fireman had told him that the other ? % m . at 0 I tram was just nbea 1 ot bitn none 01 the train uiea wis arrastei, as the legal proceeding* seem to be somewbu complicated?the accident occurring in J-ffersoa coanty, while the inquest was held in Berkeley county. Among the dox-?n pereoas who were injured was J. Ghiswell D ike, of Washington, a former resident ot this county, who was on the train as extra express messenger. He was badl^ cut about the head and knee, but was not dangerously injured. Bute's Attorney James M.
