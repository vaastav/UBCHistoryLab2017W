Pretty soon now the eyes of the whcle state will be turned towards To peka. It's time Topeka was washing her face and looking her best. Ex-Mayor Rose, of Kansas City. Kan., has paid $1,562.64 into the su preme court. We judge it doesn't pay to play horse with that august body. Adolphus Bntfeh, : the millionaire brewer, favors an Income tax. But would Mr. Buch promise not to make it up in froth on the top of the glass? President . Roosevelt will send six special message to' congress this week. President Roosevelt and his trusty typewriter must be pretty busy these days. t will be interesting to note if Thomas C. Piatt of New York, votes that Senator Smoot is not a proper man to represent Utah in the United States senate. It Is said that the Rock Island has discontinued its practice of "confiscat ing" coal. This ought to help some in abating the coal- famine in R,ock Island townr. ' Ex"-Senator Burton used to claim that he "made" Roosevelt, and every body knows what happened to Burton.

Governor-elect Hughes was enter tained at dinner at the "White House recently, but neither Senator Piatt nor Senator Depew, from Mr. Hughes' elate, were present. The- women continue to crowd the jrien out of their Jobs. This year thirty-six women were elected county superintendents of schools, an increase cf eleven over two years ago. A Salina colored woman who at the Lg of 97, kicked her husband out of th house, is now suing for a divorce because he never came back. It is pretty safe to guess that he won't con test It. While wa are agitated from time to time for fear our supply of gas will run out. it i3 soothing to note that a well flowing ten million feet a day has Just been "brought in" at Chanute and that the pressure is bo strong in the well that it blew out its tubing. Mr. Madden of the postofliee depart ment, is Inclined to make rulings detri mental to the publication of legitimate fournals in order to obliterate the postal deficit, but Congressman Mur flock has pointed out that much of the trouble, comes from fraud in the de partment itself. Now let the depart ment get busy. Noting that Senator Fred Dumont mlth announces that he sh&U cast his rote for Judge W. A. Johnson for Fnltett States senator, and advises the public to keep its eye on the Judge, the Parsons Sun says: "That is just what Kansas has been doing for the past thirty years and the more it looks Mt him. the better it likes blra. Judge Johnston has eiven the state more years of faithful service and received less for it than any other man in pub lic life. A a. lawyer he could have made tea times the amount he has re ceived in the, way of salary and today have been a rich . man instead of a comparatively poor one in this world's goods But Kansas has been the richer by hia service. In addition to increasing the salaries of the Bupreme judges the Sun would like to see the legislature enact a law placing the justices of the supreme court on the re tired list after a cer-ain age with a pension fcr their old age. Instead of electing Judge Johnston to the senate, increase the salaries of the supreme justices to an amount equal to that of the United States senators and retain him on the bench where he has so long: served the state with honor and v.here he can and will be of more service to the state than in the senate." . A 

GOOD WORD FOIi 1911. There is usually such a disposition among other Kansas towns to throw stones at Topeka, largely from force of habit doubtless, that Topeka finds it rerreshing to discover something be sides a rock coming in this direction. Topeka has no desire to crowd or be little other Kansas cities. In fact, To peka feels that it really belongs to the rest of the state, being the state capi tal; and so it has become accustomed to being the target for the rocks. It ap preciates other things occasionally, however, and it is therefore glad to note these sensible remarks in the Wichita Beacon: "The Topeka committee has deter mined to present its points to the legis lature and leave the semicentennial plans in Us hands, "Topeka realizes that the event is larger tnan any city can shoulder and it wisely unloads the proposition upon the state. "Just after the election there was heard a threat that Topeka should be punished for daring to give a majority against the Repuoiican candidate for governor. But probably the men who uttered that foolish menace have since seen the absurdity of it. "But Topeka evidently felt the threat because she now insist ; that it is the celebration and not the city of Topeka that is uppermost. The committee even goes so far as to say if the legislature prefers Wichita or some other city to Topeka, it will be all right. "Now Wichita would not antagonize Topeka and if that city showed any feel, ing in the matter - Wichita would be more likely to aid" than to hinder. But If it is a fact that the proposition for a semicentennial celebration is state wide and not the least bit local, then Wichita will reflect before advising the state to enter upon a scheme which may prove an expense to the taxpayers. "No doubt an exposition is a grand thing for a state and probably the pro posed one, which should be held at the capital if held at all, would result in the long run in profit to the state. It would simply be spending money for ad vertising which would come back ten fold in the following decade. "But the taxpayers are beginning to find government too expensive. The ccst per capita seems constantly in creasing and the tremendous gain in assets has been accompanied with cor responding demands for governmental purposes. The tremendous growth in wealth and taxable property does not cut down the tax rate perceptibly. ' "Where shall the line be drawn? When shall the knife be used for prun ing? It seems impossible to cut out any precedents. Appropriations made in the past have become fixed and if the line is to be drawn it must be on untried grounds. "It is only fair to add that the Topeka committee offers a first lien on receipts to the state to make good the appropri ation and the committee honestly be lieves that the appropriation would be but a loan, but there is no guaranty to this effect. "The state should be ready to act this winter if at all because there Is none too much time to make arrangements if the fair is to be held." This is a fair statement. The legisla ture should not, and will not, undertake the semicentennial proposition unless it will be ji benefit to-the state. There it no doubt, however, but what it will pay for itself many times over. The cost per individual will be infinitesimal, but the results will be exceedingly beneficial to the whole state. The proposition should be carefully ' considered in all its phases, and then the whole state should pull together to make the celebration a gigantic success. 

TIIE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT. Here is a little Christmas editorial so full of gentle humor and suund sense that it must Inevitably find wel come in the minds and hearts of men. It is the very last thing in the Decem ber number of the American Maga zine: "Christmas comes but once a year, and the reformer is sorry it comes so often, because It breaks up with a lit tle 24 hours of sunshine the melancholy work of making the world better. I know what my friend, the Enthusiast over there, is saying to himself. He is lamenting the fact that I permit the frivolity of a Christian festival to di vert me for a day from the cares and anxieties of the Responsible Person. Is there no political meeting in Hoboken or Coharies that I can attend on the night of December 25, when by the Grace of God I hope to be whittling a turkey? Why should I be beaming down on my well-fed (or soon to be well-fed) children, cracking old jokes, clashing at the savory white meat and probing for the stuffing, when I might be addressing a meeting of the down trodden in some centre of freedom and tyranny? A few enlightened words from me might spur indignant citizen ship to the last superb effort that will land Hans Machsnixsaus as coroner, and thus at once abolish poverty, crime, suffering, boodle, graft, disease, and lynching in the south. But I refuse to utter them. I refuse to permit the Christmas feeling that mounts within mo to be put aside by any other feeling, human or political. If there is one man at that reform meeting on Christmas night, I say disenfranchise him strike him from the rolls, deprive him of speech, reform him into the shape of a donkey! Nay, if the great Hans Machsnixsaus Is there himself, if he is anywhere but beside his own Christmas tree with a fur cap on his head and false white whiskers on his chin, then may he never achieve his crown. May he never hold inquest on me or mine. "I agree with you, this is no time for laggards. We must hasten to the toy shops. . A grave question presents It self to the manhood of America. It is, fellow citizens, what am I going tu give my wife? Shall our children starve while John I. Rockefeller gluts him self on, boiled. milKT ' No,, a ; thousand times no; they may have indigestion, but starve? Never! The real issue be fore the American people today, the issue that cannot be confused by, false reasoning or obscured by the hired scribblers of plutocratic tyranny Is: 'Is there a Santa Claus?" And when the masses of liberty-loving people, a vast majority ef the -peeple, rise in their might and their - .nighties, and creep with bare feet into the parlor and see the stockings bulging,, they will decide a3 with one voice that there is. They may not put it that way. They may just say: 'Oh, look what I got!' But it will come to the same thing. "Who-wants to change this spirit for any ether? Who fails to see in it the beginning o all ', good work in the world? The spirit of Christmas, the unselfish selfishness of giving happiness and taking it, the desire to do good if it is only for one day, and only towards one's own and the beggar at one's gate, this Is the true source of all right im provement. You cannot go to the pat ent office in Washington and take out a patent that wilt transform men into angels. The way upward, long and ted ious as it. is, lies through the hearts of men. It has been so since the Pounding of the Feast. And nothing has been proved more clearly in the political his tory of the race than, this, that good will to men has done more to improve government than laws and wars. Let us close down our desks for the year. If you want to find me for another week, I will be tn the wonderful little toy shop round the corner." Topeka is to have a new vaudeville theater, and you know if there is any thing Topeka really needs it is a few more vaudeville theaters. Now that W. A. S. Bird has been made a Great Incohonee of the Red Men, there is no longer any doubt con cerning whom he will vote for for Lnited States senator. Speaking of that white crow that has recently been donated to Baker univer sity, why doesn't some one put out a little salt and catch that Resubmission Temperance club at Junction City? Only little over a week now till the school ma'ams will be here. This department expects a pair of military brushes for Christmas. This department is bald headed. Contributed: Some one has been so unkind as to suggest that the thoughts of a state officer who was "vindicated" recently at the polls are of a cryptocrystalline order. JAYHAWKER JOTS Iola expects to have a DeForresf wireless telegraph station in the near future. Fred Trigg asks what will that Ah Sin club do at Junction City now that the joints are closed? ,;, Hiattville, down in Bourbon county, boasts of a team of horses whose com bined ages are 78 years. The Meade News is pleased to an nounce that the- mud has dried jip out there until a four-horse team is no longer required to pull an empty wagon. The Iola Register will abandon its weekly edition and publish only a daily after January 1. The average Kansas man wants his news fresh these days. A Missouri Pacific brakeman at Hia watha has escaped being injured by the cars only to be thrown down by the festive banana peeling, resulting in a broken arm. Noting that a negro in Texas was tried for a crime, convicted and exe cuted within two hours, the Leaven worth Times is anxious to know what delayed the proceedings. This is the time of year, says the Leavenworth Post, when a whole street can be thrown into a state of ex pectancy by the mere appearance of an express wagon around the corner. Attention is called to the fact that A Mad Love" which has bumped up against love's usual difficulties on the Kansas circuit, really has no connec tion with Bent Murdock's feeling for Governor Hoch. The man who claims to be the first white child born in Doniphan county has reached the responsible position of road overseer at Robinson. He was born at a boat landing on the Mis souri in 1853 and moved "out west" to Brown county in 185 7. Crop story from the Brown County World: An Everest farmer has one acre of alfalfa he has cut twice for hay and once for seed five tons of hay over seven bushels of seed. The hay is worth J 10 a ton, the seed $8 a bushel, or more than $100 for the acre. Everest Enterprise: Uncle Davo Graham was aroused the other night by a noise in the chicken house. Tak ing his gun he went out to investigate. On entering the house the first thing he saw was a black object. Taking de liberate aim at the supposed skunk he let him have it. When the smoke cleared away Uncle Dave went up to review the remains and was surprised to find that he had killed one of the best hens he had. QUAKER REFLECTIONS. TProm the Philadelphia Record. There may be germs in ktssea, but most of us are willing to believe that we are immune. Making mountains out of molehills ought to be a paying business for the real estate man. He must be a good boy who can keep a job In a rubber factory without getting bounced. It doesn't do any good to lock the sta ble door after tne horse is stolen, unless you want to save the automobile. Nell "She's a perfect cat. Belle "Nonsense! She's just as much afraid of a mouse as any of the other girls." Ha "What would you say If l should ask vou to marry me?" She "I should say you had more nerve than I gave you credit for." Muggins "I hear you have gotten square with that troublesome boy next door." Buggins "Yes: my boy got the measles and gave it to him."

Holton Recorder. A 

GOOD SUGGESTION. Every teacher, in the higher grades' of our public and private schools should have President Roosevelt's mes sage to congress read and discussed. A paragraph or section of it could be ta ken each day. We suggest that de bates upon the principal parts of the message, would add interest to the ex ercises, and would bring before the pu- pns tne problems which are now con fronting the American people. These students in our schools, are the citi zens ol the near future, and they should not be permitted to pass out into the world, without a knowledge of the great questions which they will be expected to answer at the polls. Western School Journal. 

GOOD ADVICE. A man who has said and done less splendid things than President Roose velt might fuss with the Bellamy Storers through the -newspapers. The president would well leave the job to such a man. Ottawa Herald. REFORM AT BURRTON. - A wave of reform is sweeping over Burrton, The powers that be have suppressed the-raffles, slot machines, and all kinds of games of chance; the merchants are forbidden to dispose of their goods on Sunday, and it isi said that the restauralits have been order ed to close upy shop promptly at 12 o'clock on Saturday nights.

Is whether there are any circumstances under which he could. Holton Signal. THE DIFFERENCE. It -will be noted that Frank Grimes paid the claim against him like a 1 gentleman and an honest man. "A. R.

Kingman Journal. FROM OTHER PENS LET JUSTICE BE SWIFT. The delays of the law are proverbial. The delays of California are particular ly scandalous. The delays of California law as administered in this city in im portant criminal cases have been a dis grace to civilization. It is lime that this juggling with Justice should cease. The witnesses are bere. There is no end of competent lawyers. The public wel fara demands that the courts give these cases the right of .way and expedite the trials. If Schmitz is an innocent man he should be cleared of the stigma now attached to him. If he is guilty, lie should be in the penitentiary. It is not good for this city that its government should be headed by a man indicted for bribery. It is not decent. He should be placed before a Jury at once. He is re ported to have stated, in an interview in an eastern city, that a "majority" of the grand jury which indicted him had themselves been under indictment for crime. We here know that the present grand jury is composed of respectabla citizens no one of whom has ever been even suspected of violating any provis ion cf the criminal law, and of whom but one or two have ever been active in politics. If Schmitz is starting in on that kind of a defense, the quicker he is compelled to make it in open court the better. San Francisco Chronicle. NEW AT THE
