ISLAND POSSESSIONS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED. (Bj* Assoclstril G*?*??5.? 1 "WASHINGTON". D. C. Dec. 3.?The ? ""-"residenfs annual message to Congress ? ?went in this year, for the first time, in ! print. Two copies for the two branches of the House were printed on paper of tho same .size as that which was used heretofore for the written copies, thong the paper is a heavy white, instead of the blue tint, which has been in use. Each copy was richly bound in brown morrocco. with stiff covers, with simple gold border and lettering, lhc- words on the front being "Message of tli; Presi? dent of the b'niled States, 1901." The President treats all of the impor? tant topics before the country in his vig? orous -style, and the document makes in? teresting reading. The President begins his message by a recitai of the- assassination of Presi? dent McKinley at Bu**~a~0, calling atten? tion to the fact that he JE the third oi the last seven elected Presidenti* to be killed. The circumstances of his mur? der, he declares, has "a peculiarly sin? ister significance." After a high tribute to tne late Presi? dent, and an exposition of the nature of anarchy, he says: "I earnestly recommend to the Con? gress that in the exercise of its wise discretion it should take into conside? ration the coming to this country of anarchists or persons professing princi? ples hostile to all government and jus? tifying the murder of those placed in authority. Such individual:! as those who not. long ago gathered in open meet? ing to glorify the murder of King Hum? bert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and the law should orsure their rigorous punishment. They and' those like them should be kept out of this country: and if found lier?? they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came; and far-reaching* provision should be mai.-1; for the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls more urgent? ly for tho wisest thought of the Con? gress. "The Federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the President or any man who by the Constitution or by law Is in line of succession for the presi? dency, while the punishment for an un? successful attempt should be propor? tioned" to the onormity of the offence against our institutions. Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race, and all mankind shotiiu band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offence against the law of nations, like piracy and that form of manstealing known as the slave tra-ie. for it is far blacker infamy than either. It should be so declared' by treaties amener ali civilised nowers. St.eh ireaties would prive to the Federal Gov? ernment the power of dealing with the crime. N3t"on8l.1*ros-*tfr"'v. The great prosperity of the nation is the next subject treated of by the mes ?sage. In this connection it says: "The tremendous and nighly complex industrial development which went on ?\1?? ever Accelerated rapidity during tho latter half of the nineteenth century brings us face to face, at the beginning of the twentieth, with very serious socia, problems. The old laws, and the old customs, which had almost the binding torce of law. were once quite sufficient to regulate the accumulation and distri? bution of wealth. Since the Industrial changes which have so enormously in? creased the productive power of man? kind, they are no longer sufficient. "The growth of cities has gone on be? yond comparison faster than the growth of the country, and the upbuilding of the great industrial centres has meant a startling increase, not merely in the aggregate of wealth, but in the number of very lar-je individual, and especially of very large corporate, fortunes. The creation of these great corporate for? tunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental action, but to natural causes In the business world, operating in other countries as they ope? rate in our own." "The process has aroused much antago? nism, a great part of which Is wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer ihe poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never before has the average man, tho wage worker, the farmer, the small trader. been so well off as In this country and at the present time. There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth; yet it remains true that a fortune accumulated In legitimate busi? ness can be accumulated by the person specially benefited only on condition or conferring immense incidental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise, ot the type which benefits all mankind can Duly exist if ihe conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards or success." 

TRUST QUESTION. Ur-jes Deliberation in Dealing With Combina? tions of C ipital. The portion of President Roosevelt's message dealing with what is known as the "Trusts" Is of peculiar interest. He eays: "An additional reason for caution In Sealing with corporations is to be found In the international commercial condi? tions of to-day. The same business con Sitlons which have produced the great aggregations of corporate and individual wealth have made them very potent lac tor? In international commercial competi? tion. Business concerns which have tbe ?argest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men are natura,|y :hose which take the lead in the strii?? 'or commercial supremacy among the na? tions of the world. America has only iust begun to assume that commanding .??osition in ' the international business world ? which we believe will mor? a-;d ??ore be hers- It is of the utmost. :m fcrtance ?that thia ACuUtion be not jcopuic ed. especially at a time when the over? flowing abundance of our own na.aril resources and the skill, business energy, and mechanical aptitude of our people make foreign markets essential. Under such conditions it would be most ui wise to cramp or to fetter thi youthful sli^ngth of our Nation. All in One Boat. "Moreover, it cannot too ?.dten l.c flut? ed out that to strike with Ignorant vio? lence at the interests ol ??no set of men almost inevitably endangers the interests of all. The fundamental ru'i; l? *?ur ra? tional life?the rule which ur.dtr?ies ail others?is that, on the whole, and in the long run, we shall go up or down to? gether. There are exceptions; and in times of prosperity some will prosper far more, and in times of adversity some will suncr far more, than others; but. speak? ing generally, a period, of good times means that all share more or less in them, and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater or l<"ss de? gree. It surely ought not to be necessary to enter into any proof of this state? ment: the memory of the lean years which began in lsSd is still vivid, and we can contrast them with the conditions in this very year which is now closing. Disaster to great business enterprises can never have its effect limited to the men at the top. It spreads throughout, and while it is bad for everybody, it is worst for those farthest down. The capitalist may be shorn of his luxuries; but the wnge-worker may be deprived of even bare necessities. Hatred and Fear. "The mechanism of motlern business Is so delicate that extreme care must lv taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorane?*?. Many of those who have m.ade it their vocation to de no'.ince the great industrial combinations which are popularly, although with tech? nical inaccuracy, known as "trusts.'* ap? peal especkiHy to hatred and fear. These are precisely tho two emotions, particu? larly when combined with ignorance, which unfit men for the exercise of cool and steady judgment. In facing new industrial conditions, the whole history of the world shows that legislation will generally be both unwise nnd ineffective unless undertaken after calm inqairy and with sober self-restraint. "The first essential in determining how ? deal with the great industrial combi? nations is kr.owle-dge of the facts?pub? licity. In the interest of the public, the Government should have the right to In? spect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in interstate business. Publicity is the .only sure rem? edy which we can now invoke. What I further remedies are needed in the way j of governmental regulation, or taxation, ? can only be determined after publicity has been obtained, by process of law, and in the course of administration. The first requisite Is knowledge, full and com? plete?knowledge which may be made public, to the world. Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other associations, de? pending upon the statutory law* for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and full and accurate information as to their operations should be made public regu? larly at reasonable intervals. Laws on Trusts. The large corporations, commonly call? ed trusts, though organized in one State, always do business in many States, often doing very little business in the State where they are incorporate*!. There is utter lack of uniformity in the State laws about them: and as no State has any ex? clusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in practice proved impossible to get adequate regulation through State action. Therefore, in the interest of the whole people, the Nation should, without interfering with the power of the States in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regulation over all cor? porations doing an interstate business. This is especially true where the corpora? tion derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic ele? ment or tendency in its business. There would be no hardship in such supervision; banks are subject to it, and in their case it is now accepted as a simuple matter of course. Indeed, it is probable that super? vision of corporations by the National Government nee?l not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a State as Massachusetts, in order to produce ex? cellent results. Amend Constitution. When the Constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth century, no human wisdom could foretell the sweep? ing changes, alike in industrial and poli? tical conditions, which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth cen? tury? At that time it was accepted as a matter of course that the several States were the proper authorities to regulate, so far as was then necessary, the com? paratively insignificant and strictly lo? calized corporate bodies of the day. The conditions are now wholly different end wholly different action is called for. I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the National Government to exercise control along the lines above in? dicated; profiting by the experience gain? ed through the passage and administra? tion of tho interstate-commerce act. If,, however, the judgment of the Congress is that it lacks the constitutional power to pass such an act. then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to con? fer the power. New Cabinet Officer. The President next recommends the cre? ation of a new Cabinet officer, to be known as the Secretary of Commerce and Industries. This course, he says, "is. one phase of what should be a comprehensive and far-reaching scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose of broad? ening our markets, securing our business interests on a safe basis and making firm our new position in the InternailA'Aal in dustrial world; while scrupulously safe? guarding the rights of wage-worker and capitalist, of investor and private citizen, so as to secure equity as between man and man in this r?public," 

CHINESE EXCLUSION. Thinks Act Should Be immediately Re enacted. Dealing with the welfare of the wage earners, the message declares that their Interests are of more vital import to the people of the nation than any other save the welfare of the farmers. "If the farmer a~d wage-workers are well off," says the President, "it is abso? lutely certain that all others will be well off, tco." He declares that wages are higher to elay than ever before and the standard of living higher. "Not only," he says, "must our labor be protected, by the tariff, but it should also be protected so far as it is possible from the presence in this country of any laborers brought over by contract, or of those who, coming freely, yet repre? sent a standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our men in the labor market and drag them to a lower level. I regard It as necessary, with this end in view, to re-enact immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers and to strengthen it wherever necessary in order to make its enforcement entirely effec-. tive." The message then recommends legisla? tion to do away with the competition of convict contract labor in the open mar? ket; from legislation to enforce the eight hour system, and recommends the protec? tion of women and children from excessive hours of labor. As to Unions. On the important subject of unions, the message says: "The most vital problem with which this country?and for that matter, the whole civilized world?has to deal, is the prob? lem which has for one side the better? ment of social conditions, moral and physical, in largo cities, and for ?another side the effort to deal with that tangle of far-reaching questions which we group together when we speak of "labor." The chief factor in the success of each man? wage-worker, farmer and capitalist alike?must ever he the sum total of his own individual qualities and abilities. Second only to this comes the power of acting in combination or association with others. Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wage-work?2TS, when managed with forethought, and when they com? bine insistence upon their own rights with law-abiding respect for the rights of others. The display of these qualities in such bodies is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves. Finally, there must also in many cases be action by the Government in order to safeguard the rights and interests of all. Under the Constitution, there is. much mere scope for such action by tho State and the municipality than by the. nation. But on points such as those touched on above the National Government can act. "When all is said and done, the rule of I brotherhood remains as the indispensable I prerequisite to success in the kind of na | tional life for which we strive. Each man must work for himself, and unless he so works no outside help can avail him; but each man must remember also that he is indeeel his brother's keeper, and that while no man who refuses to walk can be carried with advantage to himself or anyone else, yet that each at times stumb'ies or halts, that each at times needs to have tho helping hand out? stretched to him. To be permanently ef feetive, air must always take the form of helping a man to help himself; and we can all best help ourselves by joining to? gether in the work that, is of common interest to all." Immigration Laws. The present immigration laws are pro? nounced as unsatisfactory, and rigid laws are recommended to exclude anarchists, and to allow in this country only desirable citizens. ? "Afil persons," it says, "should be ex? cluded who are below a certain standard of economic fitness to enter our indus? trial field as competitors with American labor." THE 

TARIFF. Any General Change at This Time Most Unwise. On the tariff the message is emphatic, declaring there is general acquiesence in tho present system. "Nothing," says the President, "could be more unwise than to disturb the busi? ness interests of the country by any gen? eral tariff change at this time. Doubt, apprehesion, uncertainty are exactly what We most wish to avoid in the interest of our commercial and material well-being. Our experience In the past has shown that sweeping revisions,of the tariff are apt to produce conditions closely ap? proaching panic in the business world. Yt it is not only possibe but eminently desirable, to combine with the stability of our economic system a supplementary system of reciprocal benefit and obliga? tion with other nations. Such reciprocity is an incident and result of the firm es? tablishment and preservation of our pres? ent economic policy. It was specially provided fcr in the present tariff law. For Reciprocity. "Reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first duty ia to see that the protection granted by the tariff in every case where it is needed is maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for so far as it can safely be dope without injury to our homo indus? tries. Just how far this Is must be de? termined according to the individual case, remembering always that every applica tio of our tarifT policy to meet our shift in??, national needs must ha conditioned upon tho cardinal fact that the duties m-ust never'be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad.: The well being of the wage-worker is a prime consideration of out entire -policy of ??"oon-c-mic legislation. "Subu'ect to tlds proviso of the proper Protection necessary to our industrial well-being at home, the .principle of recl ?procity must command our hearty sup Port- The phenomenal growth of our export trade ephasizes the urgency of the need for'wider maTkets and for a liberal policy in dealing with foreign nations. "Whatever la merely petty and vexatious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom wc dis? pose of our surplus products in the long run, directly or indirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us something in return. Their ability to purchase our products shouGd as far as possible be se? cured by so arranging our tariff as to enable us to take from them those pro? ducts which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor, or the use of which wiil be of marked benefit to us." The President closes this subject by commending, to Congress the considera? tion of the reciprocity treaties of his pre? decessor. 

GOLD STANDARD. Fixing Currency on That Basis Timely and Judicious. The President recommends vigorous ac? tion to restore the American merchant rmarine to the ocean. He says: "At present American shipping is under certain great disadvantages when put in competition with tho shipping of foreign countries. ?Many of the fast foreign steamships, at a speed of fourteen knots ot above, are subsidized; and all our ships, sailing vessels and steamers alike, cargo carriers of slow speed and mail carriers of high speed have to meet the fact that the original cost of building American ships is greater than is the case abroad; that the wages paid Ameri? can officers and seamen are very much righer than those paid the officers and seamen of foreign competing countries; a/nd that the standard of living on our ships is far superior to the standard of living on tho ships of our commercial ri? vals," The message speaks of the act of "March 14, 1900, to establish gold as the standard money as "timely and judicious." "The National Banking Law," It says, "in many. respects furnishes sufficient liberty for the proper exorcise of the bank ing function; but there seems to be need of better safeguards against the derang? ing influence of commercial crises and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of the country should be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade and commerce." Strict economy, but not nigpardlyness in public expenditures is recommended. Interstate Commerce. In regard to the Interstate Commerco act of 1SS7, the President says it should be amended. He gives his reasons thus: "The railway is a public servant. Its rates should,be just to and open to all shippers alike. The Government should see to it that within its jurisdiction this Is so and should provide a speedy, inex? pensive and effective remedy to that end. At the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are the ar? teries through which the commercial life, blood of this.:?nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enact? ment of legislation which would unneces? sarily interfere with the development and operation of these commercial agencies. The subject is one of great importance and calls for the earnest attention of the Congress." 

ARID LANDS. President Makes Strong Reccoramendation ior Their Reclaimation. On the important subjects of forestry and game protection and the irrigation and reclamation of the arid lands of the country, the President says: Public opinion throughout the United States has moved steadiiy toward a just appreciation of the value of forests, whether planted or of natural growth. The great part played by them in the creation and maintenance of the national wealth is now more fully realized than ever before. Wise forest protection does not mean tho -withdrawal of forest resources, whether of wood, water or grass, from contributing their full share to the wel? fare of the people, but. on the contrary, gives the assurance of larger and moro certain supplies. The fundamental idea of forestry is the perpetuation of for? ests by use. Forest protection Is not an end of itself; it is a means to in?rrease and sustain tho resources of our country ?and the industries which depend upon them. . The preservation of our forests is an imperative business necessity. \Xe have come to see clearly that whatever destroys the forest, except to make way for agriculture, threatens our well-being. At present, the protection of the forest reserves rests with the General Land Office, the mapping and description of their timber with the United States Geo? logical Survey, and the preparation of plans for their conservative use with the Bureau of Forestry, which is also charged with the general advancement of prac? tical forestry in the United States. These various function should be united in the Bureau o"-Forestry, to which they prop? erly belong. The wise administration of the forest ?reserves will be not less helpful to the interests which depend on water than to those whicli depend on wood and grass. The watt?.- supply itself depends upon the fore?t In the arid region it is water, not land, which measures production. The western half of the United States would sustain a population greater than that of our whole country to-day if the waters that now run to waste were saved and used for irrigation. The forest and water p.-oblems are perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States. Game Laws. Certain of the forest reserves should also be made preserves for the wild for? est creatures. All of the reserves should be better protected from fires. Many of them need eptoicl protection because of the great injury done by live stock, above all by sheep. The increase in deer, elk, and other animals in the Yellowstone Park shows what may be expected when other mountain forests are properly pro? tected by law and properly guarded. Some of these areas have been so de? nuded of surface vegetation by overgraz? ing that the ground breeding birds, in? cluding grouse and quail, and many mam? mals, including deer, have been exter? minated or driven away. At the same time the water-storing capaciti' of the surface has been decreased or destroyed, thus promoting floods in times of rain and diminishing the flow of streams be? tween rains. The -forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams in flood and re? plenishing . them in drought they make possible the use of waters otherwise wasted. They prevent the soil from washing, and so .protect the storage reservoirs from ?llins* ud. with silt For est conservation. is therefore an essential condition of water conservation. National Function. Tho forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve.the waters of the arid region,. Great storage works are necessary to equalize the flow of streams and to save the flood waters Their con? struction has been ?conclusively shown to bo an tm*dertaking too vast for private effort. Nor can it bo best accomplished by the individual States actifig alone. Far-reaching Interstate problems are in? volved; and the resuorces of single States would often be inadequate. It is properly a n-ttfonal function, at least in some o? its features. It is as right for the Na? tional Government to make the. streams and rivers of the arid region useful by engineering works for water storage as to make useful the rivers and harbors of the humid region by engineering works of another kind. The storing of the floods in reservoirs at tho headwaters of our rivers is but an enlargement of our pres? ent policy of river control, under which levels are built on the lower.reaches of the same streams. Tho Government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it does other public works. Where.their purpose is to regulate the flow of streams, the water should be turned freely into the chan? nels in tho dry season to take the same course under the same laws as the natu? ral flow. The reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands presents a different prob? lem. Here it is not enough to regulate the flow of streams. The object of the Government is to ellspose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon it To accomplish this object water must be brought within their reach. The pioneer settlers ori the arid public domain chose their homes along streams from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaim their holdings. Such opportunities are practically gone. There remain, however, vast areas of public land which can b?; made available for homestead settlement, but only by reservoirs and main-line canals imprac? ticable for private enterprise. These ir? rigation works should be built Dy the National Government. The lands re? claimed by them should be reserved by the Government for actual settlers, and the cost of construction should, so far as possible, be repaid by the land re? claimed. This distribution of the water, the division of the streams among Irri? gators, should be left to the settlers themselves in conformity with ?State laws and without interference with those laws or with vested rights. The policy of the National Government should be to aid irrigation in the several States an 1 Territories in such manner as will en? able the people in the local communities to help themselves, and as will stimulate needed reforms in the State laws f nd regulations governing irrigation. Foundation Already Laid. The reclamation and settlement -jf the arid lands will enrich every portion of our country, just as the settlement cf the Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought prosperity to the Atlantic States. The increased demand for manufactured ar? ticles will stimulate industrial produc? tion, while wider home markets and lhe trade of Asia will consume the larger food supplies and effectually prevent Western competition with Eastern -0ri culture. Indeed, the products ef irriga? tion will be consumed chiefly in upbuild? ing local centers of mining and other in? dustries, which would otherwise not. come into existence at all. Our people, as a whole, will profit, for successful home making is but another name for the up? building of the nation. The necessary foundation has ...ready beep laid for the inauguration of the policy just described. It would be unwise to begin by doing too much, it'or a great deal will doubtless be learned, both as to what can and what cannot be safely attempted. by the early efforts, which must of necessity be partly experimental in character. At the very beginning the Government should make clear, beyond shadow of doubt, its intention to pursue this policy on lines of the broadest pub? lic interest. No reservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy selfish, personal or local interests; but only in accordance with the advice of trained experts, after long investigation, hag shown the local? ity where all the conditions combine to make the work most needed and fraught with the greatest usefulness to the com? munity as a whole. There should be to extravagance, and the believers in the need of irrigation will most benefit their cause by seeing to it that it is free from the least taint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the public moneys. 

FOREIGN POSSESSIONS. Recommends Development of tbe Island cf Hawaii. The message treats at great length of the new possessions of the United States. It recommends the development of Ha? waii along American lines, calls atten? tion to the thriving condition of Porto Rico and intimates that Cuba will soon be in condition to start life as her own mistress. In regard to the Philippines, the mes? sage says: "In dealing with the Philippine people we must show both patience and strength, forbearance and steadfast res? olution. Our claim is high. We do not desire to do for the islanders merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peo? ples by even the best foreign govern? ments. XVe hope to do for them what has never before been done for any people of the tropics?to make them fit for self government after the fashion of the reallj free nations. ' "History may safely be challenged to show a single instance in which a master? ful race such as ours,, having been forced by the exigencies of war to take pos? session of an alien, land, has behaved to its inhabitants with the disinterested zeal for their progress that our people have shown in the Philippines. To leave the Islands at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter of murderous anarchy. Such desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against humanity. The character of Governor Taft and of his associates and sutTordinates is a proof, if such be needed, of the sincerity of our effort to give the islanders a constantly increasing measure of ? self-government, excietly as fast as they show themselves fit to exercise it. Since the civil govern? ment was established not an appointment has been made in the islands with any. reference to considerations of political in? fluence, or to aught else save the fitness of the man and the needs of the ser? vice." Encourage Business. "It is necessary," continues the Presi? dent, "that the Congress should pass ? laws by which the resources of the isl? ands can be developed; so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can bo grant? ed to companies doing business in them, and every encouragement be given to the incoming of business* men of every* kind." The need of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines is pointed out, and Congress urged to make some provision for it. ISTHMIAN CANAL. New Treaty Ready^ for., Confirmation of Senate. On the very important subject of the NicarasEua Canal tha 'rngscaarq says: "No single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this conti? nent is of such consequence to the American people as the building of a canal across the Isthmus connecting North and South America. Its import? ance to the Nation is by no means lim? ited merely to its material effects upon our business prosperity; and yet with view to these effects alone it would be I to the last degree important for us in-. mediately to begin it. While its bene- i fieial effects would perhaps be most mark- i ed upon the Pacific, coast and the Gulf and South Atlantic States, it would also great- j ly benefit other sections. It Is emphati? cally a work which it is for the interest of the entire country to begin and com? plete as soon as possible: it is one of those great works which only a great nation can undertake with prospects of success, and which when done are not only permanent r.ssets in the nation's material interests, but standing monu? ments to its constructive ability." "I am glad to be able to announce to j you that our negotiations on thi?? subject with Great Britain, conducted on both sides in a spirit of friendliness and mu- ? tual good will and respect, have result- I ed In my being able to lay before the i Senate a treaty which tf ratified will en- i able us to begin preparn.ti.-ins for an Isth mian canal at any time, and which guar antees to this Nation every right that it ! has ever asked in connection with the canal. In this treaty, the ol?l Clayton- ! Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as in? adequate to supply the base for the construction and maintenance of a ne? cessarily American ship canal, is abro? gated. It specifically provides that the United States alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal and shall regu? late its neutral use by all nations on terms of equality without the guaranty or interference of any outside nation from any quarter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before the Senate, and if approved the Congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantages it secures us by providing for the build? ing of the. canal." The Monroe Doctrine. The President commands the Monroe Doctrine, which should, he says, "be the cardinal feature of the foreign policy of the two Americas, as it is of the Unit? ed States." Then he continues: "This doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any Ameri? can power, save that it in truth allows each of them to form such as it desires In other words, it is really a guaranty of the commercial independence of the Americas. We ? do not ask under this doctrine for any exclusive commercial dealings with any other American State. AVe do not guarantee any State against punishn-.-nt If it misconducts itself, pro? vided that punishment does not take the forni of the acquisition of territory by any non-American power. NEW 

NAVY. Wants to See it Upbuilt and Greatiy Im- | proved. The message declares that the work of upbuilding the navy must be steadily continued. He points out that it is the best way to secure peace to maintain a navy of irresistible power. The great necessity for training men for the ser? vice is "enlarged on, and the formation of a national naval reserve is recommenu ed. As to the army the President is of opinion that it should not be increased, but should be kept up to the highest de? gree of efficiency. He makes these re? commendations: "A general staff should be created. .?. for the present staff and supply depart? ments, they should be filled by details from the line, the men so detailed re? turning after a while to their line duties. It is very undesirable to have the senior grades of the ?army composea' of men who have come to till the posi? tions by the mere fact of seniority. A system should be adopted by which there shall be an elimination grade by grade of those who seem unfit to render the best service in the next grade. Justice to the veterans of the cfvi! war who are still in the army would seem to require that in the matter of retirements they be given by law the same privileges ac? corded to their comrades in the navy. Fittest to Survive. "The process of elimination o? the least fit should be conducted in a man? ner that would render it practically im? possible to apply political or social pres? sure on behalf of any candidate, so thai each man may be judged purely on his own merits. Pressure for the promotion of civil officials for political reasons is bad' enough, but it Is tenfold worse where applied on behalf of officers of the army or navy. Every promotion and every detail under the War Department must be made solely with regard to the good of the service and to the capacity and merit of the man himself. No pres? sure, political, social, or personal, of any kind, will be permitted to exercise the least effect in any question of. promotion or detail; and if there is reason to be? lieve that such pressure is exercised at the instigation of the officer concerned, it will be held to militate against nlm. In our army we cannot afford to have re-wards or duties distributed sa?.*e on the simple ground that those who by their own merits are entitled to the re? wards get them, and that those who are peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen to perform them. Increase ot Pay. "A great debt is owing from the pub? lic to the men of the army and navy. They should be so treated as to enable tliem to reach the highest point of ef? ficiency, so that they may be able to re? spond instantly to any demand made upon them to sustain the interests of the nation and the honor of the Hag. The individual American enlisted man is probabiy on the whole a more formiu able fighting man than the regular ot any other army. Every consideration shouid be shown him. and in return the highest standard of usefulness shoulu be exacted from him. It is well worth while for the Congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted men upon second and subs?quent enlistments should not be increased to correspond with the increased value of the veteran soldier." The Militia. In regard to the militia the President has to say: "Action should be +*?ken in reference to the militia ar.d to the raising of vol? unteer forces. Our militi*;? lav.- is obsolete and worthless. The organization and armament of the National Guard of the several States, which are treated as militia in the appropriations by ?p?=? Congress, should be made identical witii those provided for the regular forces. The obligations and duties of the Guard in time? of war should be carefully de? fined, and a system established by law under which the method of procedure or raising volunteer forces should be- pre? scribed in advance. It is utterly impos? sible In the excitement and haste of Im? pending war to do this satisfactorily if the arrangement's ha?>e not been made long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing in the first volunteer organizations called out the training of those citizens who have already had ex? perience under arms, and especially for the selection in advance of the officers of any force which may be raised: for careful selection of the sind necessary! is impossible after the outbreak of war." Tribute to Veterans. ? To the Gray and the Blue the Presi? dent na-?'? this tributei ? I No other citizens deserve so well ot the republic as the veterans, the survi? vors of those who . saved the Union. They did the one deed which. If lett un? done, would have meant that all else ia our history went ior? nothing. But for their steadfast prowess in tho greatest crisis of our history, alt ' our annals would be meaningless, and our great ex? periment in popular freedom and sen government a gloomy failure. Moreover, they not only left us a Salted nation, but they left us also a heritage the memory of the mighty cfeeds by which the nation was kept united. We are now inder? one nation, one In fact as well as m name: we are united in our devotion to the flacr which is the eymboj of national greatness and unity; and the very com? pleteness of our union enables us" all. In every part of the country, to glory In the valor shown alike by the sons of tne North and the sons of the South in the times that tried men'? souls." 

CIVIL SERVICE. Recommends Extension of the Rules to Dia trict of Columbia. The President comes out strongly for civil service. He commends the merit system and says all applicants should havo a "fair field and no favor.*" He continues: "I recommend' the passage of a law which will extend the classified service j. to the District of Columbia, or will at : least enable the President thus to ex : tend it. in my judgment all haws pro I vieiing for the tempor?re- employment of j clerks should hereafter contain a provi j sion that they be selected under the i civil service law." On the Indian question the President has pronounced views. He favors recog? nizing the red man. and not as a tribe. On this subject he says: Tho Indian should be treated as an individual?like the white man. During the change of treatment inevitable hard? ships will occur: every effort should bo | made to minimize these hardships; but | we should not bee:? use ot them hesitate to make the change. There should be a continuous reduction In the number of agencies." He commends next the St. Douls ami Charleston Expositions to the good-will of the people; favors public libraries, and recommends that the Census Office be made a permanent Government bureau. Rural Free D:livery. In speaking of the great growth of th? postal service, the President says: "It is just that the great agricultural population should share in the improve? ment of the service. The number ?if ru? ral routes now in operation is fi.W). prac? tically all established within three year?. and there are 6.0X) applications awaiting action. It is expected that the number in operation at the close of the current fiscal year will reach 3.600?. The mall will then be daily carried to the doors of 3.700.000 of our people who have here? tofore been dependent upon distant of? fices, and one-third of all that portion of the country, which is adopted to It will be covered by this kind of service. The Open Door. The recent Chinese imbroglio is next treated at some length, and the subject is concluded as follows: "We advocate the 'open eloor' with all that it implies; not merely the procure ment of enlarged commercial opportuni? ties on the coasts, but accesa to tho in? terior by the waterways with which China has been so extraordinarily favored. Only by bringing the people of China into peaceful and friendly community of trade with all the peoples of the earth can the work now auspiciously begun be carried to fruition?- in the. attainment of this purpose we necessarily claim, parity of treatment. under the conventions, throughout the Empire for our trade and our citizens with those of all other pow? ers. ' The message is brought tj a close witft these words: "We reverently thank the Alm'.ghty that we are at peace with the nations of mankind; and wc firmiy intend ?.nat our policy shall be such as to continue un? broken these international relations of. mutual respect and good will."
