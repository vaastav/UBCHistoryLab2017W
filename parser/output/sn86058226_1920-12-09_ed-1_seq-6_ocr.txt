Senator Watson's Suggestions The , Chicago New? has the following to say about Senator Watson's, suggestions relative to the revenue problem: y' "On the many' recent utterances by influen tial nemberi of congress respecting the solution of .the -.revenue problem the most sensible are tKbse p Senator, Watson of Indiana,' who appre ciated; the 'necessity of immediate action by con gress fox relief of the overburdened taxpayer as welt "Saof .letiimate i business struggling with the difficulties of readustment from a war to a peace basis . ; "The Indiana senator advocates repeal of the excess profits taxes, but he does not stop there. He; also favors: a reduction of the present, sur taxes on the large incomes, a proposal which de serves serious consideration from those. who telieve in equity as a basic principle of taxation. I ; "Finally, Senator Watson urges the-extension ; of the time for the payment of the war debt over I a period of 60 years. It is to be hoped that in this, as in the other proposals, he reflects a grow- ing sentiment among congressional -leaders. The treasury department has adhered stubbornly to I its origjnal idea that the war debt ought to be discharged within 25 years. Such a policy would J be -unjust to the taxpayers and detrimental to " business It would prevent any substantial re- 1 duction 'of the crippfing taxes imposed by the j war revenue law. 2 "A sound policy of national economy and a I due regard for the stability of national industry ; urge the extension of the time for the discharge ! of the war debt over the period suggested."

WALT MASON THE EXPENSIVE LUXURY. My auto keeps me busted, my stand off goes no more, in shops -where I was trusted in happy days of yore. "N'ay, nay," exclaims the grocer, when for some prunes 1 go; "you've grown too blooming slow, sir, in paying what you owe. You blow for gas and rub ber. th coin yoH-owe for rice, bo :hase yourself, you lubber, ' or else bring In the price." - My auto is a daisy; It fairly burns 'the soil; but it has made me lazy, l balk ' at honest toil.. The old blue sheep needs shear ing, I ought to bale some hay, but here t am careering gome forty versts away. ' . The kitchen should be paint ed, the roof is gaping wide; but who would get acquainted with work, when he can ride? My wife is sorely need ing '.some deecnt rags to wear, but. I've been pinched for speeding and have no coin to spare. My auto keeps me ' busted, mechanics get my - wad ; some ,bolts must be adjusted," some carbon; must be thawed; she needs an overhauling, which costs two hundred beans, the while the kids are bawling for bread and wholesome greens. Ah, gee," the merchants mutter, when I would buy some wood some codfish or noine butter "your credit is no good; and once," they say, embittered, ''like some bright twinkling star, your credit glowed and' glittered before you owned a car." - Today's Talk By George Matthew Adams t ... . i 1 ON THE SIDE OF THE ANGELS. ; A really great critic, speaking of the ' writings of a famous man, said that t (here were times when he wrote "on 'the side of the angels!" I And what he meant by this, I be- j lieve, was-that there were times whenj. ". that writer became so intensely sin-1 r ere and beautiful -in thought that vhat he said was beyond criticism. We are all the time doing things of which we are ashamed. 'We make many mistanes. But just the minute that we feel sorry m our hearts, we walk over on the side of the angels The average man's capacity for FREE TO : ASTHMA SUFFERERS i Free Trial of a Method That Anyone Can Use Without .Discomfort or Loss of Time ' We have a method for the control oi ; Tsthma, and v want you to try it at our expense, iso matter whether your case is of long standing or recent de velopment, whether it is present as oc casional or chronic Asthma,' you should send for a free trial of our method.

FREE TRIAL COUPON FrtONTIER ASTHMA CO.. 'Room 151N. Niagara sand. .Hudson .Streets, Buf falo, N.-Y. T - i :; ' Send free trial of your method to: ception everywhere in the United States. It refers to the enactment of legislation to provide for immediate relief for the men who were dis abled in the World war. Congress will not ignore this recommenda tion, for its members feel that the present sys tem is not giving satisfactory results and are convinced that remedial legislation is heeded at once. The time that elapses between the filing of a claim for compensation and the final disposition of the case is shamefully long, as a number of disabled men in And again, the some cases is so the generosity of One cannot blame the young men whose pro ductive ability has been seriously impeded for objecting to the manner in which their claims are handled. ' They gave generously of their life and its possibilities for the great ideal of democracy, and now, with victory assured, they seemingly are forgotten and their plight is unnoticed. Congress cannot act too soon to remedy this situation. Let it reorganize the department that handles compensation claims, so that red tape is eliminated and service men are rewarded "as they deserve. The Budget System Undoubtedly congress will act again, on bud get legislation. The bill, which President Wilson vetoed because it contained provisions to which he objected, was only the forerunner of legisla tion that is sure to be enacted within a reason ably short time. It has taken the national legislators a long time to see the advantages of applying to federal Lbusiness those tions have been using with success for many years ; but the sincerity of congress on the meas ure cannot be doubted now. The adoption of a budget system will tend to cut down unnecessary expenses and will enable the government to approach its expenditures from a scientifically sound viewpoint. The con fusion of the old system will disappear. No longer will one committee draft revenue meas ures and another pass on appropriations, without reference to actual facts. good and kindness is much greater than that for wrong and error and one reason for this is that he gets so much more for good than for evil. The one who does wrong never feels com fortable, whereas the one who does a worthy thing at once is thrilled with the desire to do a better one. I like to think of my angels as very human and loveable. I don't like to think of their wings if they have any. I like to think of them as the in visible figures of my better self the self that is "righteous altogether" vital, strong, gentle, full of under standing, not free to anger, wholly un selfish, clean a working self. Somehow or other, I always get very near to discouraged folks because, I guess, I have been there so many times myself But still more because I fancy that the angels are just a little nearer them than anybody else. And the big business of angels is to inspire! feo let's go on the side of the angels as often as we can. When Lincoln spoke those immortal words "with malice toward none, with charity for all," he walked over and stood on the side of the angels. And every time the business man feels a human soul working with him in stead of a mere employe, he too associates with the ideals of angels. We can all be so much better than we are. Let us keep trying!
