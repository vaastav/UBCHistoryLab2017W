'Washington, Dec. 3.—The following Is the full text of President Roosevelt's message to the second session of the Fifty-ninth congress: To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: As a nation we still continue to enjoy a literally unprecedented prosper ity; and it is probable that only reckless speculation apd disregard of legitimate business methods on the part of the business world can materially mar this prosperity. No congress in our time has done more good work of importance than the pres ent congress. There were several mat ters left unfinished at your last session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will complete before your adjourn ment. I again recommend a law prohibiting all corporations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already past one house of con gress. Let individuals contribute as they desire; but let us prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making contributions for any political purpose, directly or indirectly. Another bill which has just past one house of the congress and /which is ur gently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring upon the govern ment the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists in many of the states; it exists in the District of Columbia by act of the congress. It is of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for the de fendant on the merits should be set aside. Recently in one district where the government had indicted certain per sons for conspiracy in connection with rebates, the court sustained the defend ant's demurrer; while in another juris diction an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under it, and two defendants sentenced to impris onment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflict with each other, but it is unfortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At pres ent there is no way by which the gov ernment can cause such a conflict, when It occurs, to be solved by an appeal to a higher court; and the wheels of justice are blocked without any real decision of the question. 1 can not too strongly urge the passage of the bill in question. A failure to pass will result In seriously it. •n f.f, y ■ ' f n 7 V / Wm V/ 1 f' \ IT President Roosevelt. hampering the government In its effort to obtain justice, especially against wealthy individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may also prevent the government from obtaining justice for wageworkers who are not themselyes able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of an inferior , court has been against them. 1 have specifically In view a recent decision by a district Judge leaving railway employees with out remedy for violation of a certain so called labor statute. It seems an absurd ity to permit a single district judge, against what may be the judgment the immense majority of his colleagues ion the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "uncon stitutional," and then to deny to the 'government the right to have the su preme court definitely decide the ques tion. of Criminal Prosecutions. It is well to recollect that the real efficiency of the law often depends not upon the passage of acts as to which there Is great public excitement, but upon the passage of acts as to which there is not much public excitement, because there is little pub lic understanding of their importance, while the interested parties are keenly alive to the desirability of defeating them. The importance of enacting into law the particular bill in question is further increased by the fact that the government has now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law In those trust and interstate commerce cases where such a course offers a rea sonable chance of success. At first, as was proper, every effort was made to en force these laws by civil proceedings; but it has become increasingly evident that the action of the government In finally deciding, In certain cases, to un dertake criminal proceedings was justi fiable; and tho there have been some conspicuous failures in these cases, we have had many successes, which have undoubtedly had a deterrent effect upon evil-doers, whether the penalty inflicted was in the shape of fine or Imprison ment—-and penalties of both kinds have already been inflicted by the courts. Of course, where the judge can see his way to inflict the penalty of imprison ment the deterrent effect of the punish ment on other offenders is increased; but sufficiently heavy fines accomplish much. Judge Holt, of the New York district court, in a recent decision admir ably stated the need for treating just severity offenders of this kind, opinion runs in part as follows: "The government's evidence to estab lish the defendant's guilt was clear, conclusive and undisputed. The case was a flagrant one. The transactions which took place under this illegal contract were very large; the amounts of rebates returned were considerable; and the amount of the rebate itself was large, amounting to more than one-fifth of the entire tariff charge for the transporta tion of merchandise from this city to Detroit. It Is not too much to say. In my opinion, that if this business wa* carried on for a considerable time on of this nature with His that basis—that is, If this discrimination in favor of this particular shipper was made with an 18 instead of a 23 cent rate and the tariff rate was maintained as against their competitors—the re sult might be and not Improbably would be that their competitors would be driven out of business. This in its nature is deliberate and premedi tated. I think over a fortnight elapsed between the date of Palmer's letter re questing the reduced rate and the answer of the railroad company deciding to grant it, and then for months after wards this business was Carried on and these claims for rebates submitted month after month and checks in payment of them drawn month after month. Such a violation of the law, in my opinion, in its essential nature, is a very much more heinous act than the ordinary common, vulgar crimes which come be fore criminal courts constantly for pun ishment and which arise from sudden passion or temptation. This crime in this case was committed by men of education and of large business experi ence, whose business standing in the community was such that they might have been expected to set an example of obedience to law, upon the main tenance of which alone in this country the security of their property depends. It was committed on behalf of a great railroad corporation, which, like other railroad corporations, has received gra tuitously from the state large and valu able privileges for the public ience and its own, which performs quasi public functions and which is charged with the highest obligation in the trans action of its business to treat the citizens of this country alike, and not to carry on Its business with unjust discriminations between different citizens or different classes of citizens. This crime in its nature is one usually done with secrecy, and proof of which It is very difficult to obtain. The interstate commerce act was passed in 1887, nearly 20 years ago. Ever since that time complaints of the granting of rebates by railroads has been common, urgent, insistent, and altho the congress has repeatedly past legis lation endeavoring to put a stop to this evil, the difficulties of obtaining proof upon which to bring prosecution in these cases is so great that this is the first ease that has ever been brought in this court, and, as I am informed, this case and one recently brought in Philadelphia are the only cases that have ever been brought In the eastern part of this coun try. In fact, but few cases of this kind have ever been brought in this country, east or west. Now, under these circum stances, I am forced to the conclusion. In a case in which the proof is so clear and the facts are so flagrant, it Is the duty of the court to fix a penalty which shall in some degree be commensurate with the gravity of the offense. As be tween the two defendants, in my opinion, the principal penalty should be imposed on the corporation. The traffic manager in this case, presumably, acted without any advantage to himself and without any interest in the transaction, either by the direct authority or in accordance with what he understood to be the policy or the wishes of his employer. "The sentence of this court in this case is, that the defendant Pomeroy, for each of the six offenses upon which he has been convicted, be fined the sum of 31,000, making six fines, amounting In all to the sum of $6,000; and the defendant. The New York Central & Hudson River Rail road company, for each of the six crimes of which It has been convicted, be fined the sum of $18,000, making six fines amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $108,000, and Judgment to that effect will be entered in this case." crime is one which 's conven Evasion by Technicalities. In connection with this matter, I would like to call attention to the very unsat isfactory state of our criminal law, re sulting In large part from the hab't of setting aside the judgments of Inferior courts on technicalities absolutely un connected with the merits of the case, and where there Is no attempt to show that there has been any failure of sub stantial Justice. It would be well to en act a law providing something to the effect that: No judgment shall be set aside or new trial granted in any cause, civil or crim inal, on the ground of misdirection of the jury or the improper admission or re jection of evidence, or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure unless, in the opinion of the court to which the application is made, after an examina tion of the entire cause, it shall affirma tively appear that the error complained oi has resulted In a miscarriage of justice. Injunctions. In my last message I suggested the en actment of a law in connection with the Issuance of injunctions, attention hav ing been sharply drawn to t by the demand that the right ing injunctions in labor cases wholly abolished. It Is at least doubtful whether a law abolishing altogether the use of injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts; in which case of course the legislation would be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of injunctions. It is criminal to permit sympathy with criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy violence there should be no of the power of the courts to deal with them In the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the .power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated last year. In this matter of injunctions there Is lodged in the hands of the Judiciary a necessary power which is nevertheless subject to the possibility of grave abuse, it is a power that should be exercised with extreme cafe and should be sub ject to the jealous scrutiny of all men, and condemnation should be meted out as much to the judge who fails to use It boldly when necessary as to the judge who uses It wantonly or oppressively. Of course, a judge strong enough to be fit for his office will enjoin any resort to violence or intimidation, especially by conspiracy, no matter what his opinion may be of the rightB of the original quar rel. There must be no hesitation In dealing with disorder. But there must likewise be no such abuse of the in junctive power as is Implied in forbidding laboring men to strive for their own bet terment in peaceful and lawful ways; nor must the injunction be used merely to aid some big corporation in carrying out schemes for its own aggrandizement. It must be remembered that a prelim inary Injunction in a labor case, if granted without adequate proof (even when authority can be found to support the conclusions of law on which It is founded), may often settle the dispute between the parties; and therefore if granted may do Irreparable et there are many judges who the matter of apply should be e or property by mob Impairment improperly wrong. Y< assume a matter-of-fact course granting of a preliminary Injunction to be the ordinary and proper judicial disposition of such cases; and there have undoubt edly been flagrant wrong by Judges In connection wi putes even within the last few years, altho I think much less often than in former years. Such Judges by their un wise action Immensely strengthen the hands of those who are striving entirely to do away with the power of injunction; and therefore such careless use of the injunctive process tends to threaten its very existence, for if the American peo ple ever become convinced that this process is habitually abused, whether In matters affecting labor or in matters af fecting corporations, it will 1 be well-nigh impossible to prevent its abolition. s committed th. labor dis Criticism of the Judiciary. It may be the highest duty of a Judge at any given mombnt to disregard, not merely the wishes of individuals great political or financial power, but the overwhelming tide of public senti ment. and the judge who does thus dis regard public sentiment when It is wrong, who brushes aside the plea of any spe cial Interest when the pleading Is not founded on righteousness, performs the highest service to the country. Such a Judge is deserving of all honor; and all honor cannot be paid to this wise and fearless Judge if we permit the growth of an absurd convention which would forbid any criticism of the judge of an other type, who shows himself ttmld in the presence of arrogant disorder, or who on insufficient grounds grants an in junction that does grave injustice, or who in his capacity as a eonstruer, and therefore in part a maker of the law, In flagrant fashion thwarts the cause of decent government. The judge has a power over which no review can be exer cised; he himself sits in review upon the acts of both the executive and legisla tive branches of the government; save in the most extraordinary pages he is amenable only at the bar of public opin ion; and it is unwise to maintain that public opinion in reference to a man with such power shall neither be exprest nor led. The best Judges have ever been fore most to disclaim any immunity from criticism. This has been true since the days of the great English Lord Chancel lor Parker, who said: "Let all people be at liberty to know What I found my judgment upon; that, so when 1 have given it in any cause, others may be at liberty to judge of me." The proprieties of the case were set forth with singular clearness and good temper by'Judge W. H. Taft, when a United States circuit Judge, 11 years ago, in 1895: "The opportunity freely and publicly to criticize judicial action Is of vastly more Importance to the body politic than the immunity of courts and Judges from unjust aspersions and attack. Nothing tends more to render Judges careful in their decisions and anxiously solicitous to do exact 1 justice than the conscious ness that every act of theirs is to be subjected to the intelligent scrutiny and candid criticism of their fellow-men. Such criticism is beneficial in proportion as it is fair, dispassionate, discriminating and based on a knowledge of sound legal principles. The comments made by, iearned text writers and by the acute editors of the various law reviews upon judicial decisions are therefore highly useful. Such critics constitute more or less Impartial tribunals of professional opinion before which each judgment is made to stand or fall on Its merits, and thus exert a strong influence to secure uniformity of decision. Hut non-profes sional criticism also is by no means without its uses, even if accompanied, as It often is, by a direct attack upon the judicial fairness and motives of the occu pants of the bench; for if the law is but the essence of common sense, tIre pro test of many average men may evidence a defect in a judicial conclusion, tho based on the nicest legal reasoning and profoundest learning. The two important elements of moral character In a Judge are an earnest desire to reach a Just conclusion and courage to enforce it. In sofar as fear of public comment does not affect the courage of a judge, but only spurs him on to search his consicence and to reach the result which approves itself to his inmost heart, such comment serves a useful purpose. There are few men, whether they are Judges for life or for a shorter term, who do not prefer earn and hold the respect of all, and who cannot be reached and made to pause and deliberate by hostile public criticism. In the case of judges having a life tenure indeed, their very independence makes the right freely to comment on their decisions of greater Importance, because it is the only practical and available in strument In the hands of a free people to keep such judges alive to the reason able demands of those they serve "On the other hand, the danger of de stroying the proper influence of judicial decisions by creating unfounded preju dices against the courts justifies and re quires that unjust attacks shall be met and answered. Courts must ultimately rest their defense upon the inherent strength of the opinions they deliver as the ground for their conclusions and must trust to the calm and deliberate Judgment of all the people as their best vindication." Sound Judgment of the People. There Is one consideration which should be taken into account'by the good people who carry a sound proposition to an ex cess In objecting to any criticism of a Judge's decision. The instinct of the American people as a whole is sound in this matter. They will not subscribe to the doctrine that any public servant is to be above criticism. If the best citi zens, those most competent to express their judgment in such matters, and above all those belonging to the great and honorable profession of the bar, so profoundly influential in American life, take the position that there shall be no criticism of a judge under any cir cumstances, their view will not be ac cepted by the Americarv people as a whole. In such event the people will turn to, and tend to aceffpt as Justifiable, the intemperate and improper criticism uttered by unworthy agitators. Surely, it is a misfortune to leave to such crit ics a function, right in Itself, which they are certain to abuse. Just and temperate criticism, when necessary, is a safeguard against th* acceptance by the people as a whole of that intemperate antag onism towards the judiciary which must be combated by every right-thinking man, and which, if it become widespread among the people at large, would consti tute a dire menace to the republic. of THE 

NEGRO PROBLEM. President Says Mob Law In n Menace to the Country. In connection with the delays of the law, I call your attention and the atten tion of the nation to the prevalence of crime among us, and above all to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up, now in one part of our country, now in another. Each section, north, south, east or west, has its own faults; no section can with wisdom spend Its time jeering at the faults of another section; it should be busy trying to amend its own shortcomings. To deal with the crime of corruption it is neces sary to have an awakened public con science, and to supplement this by whatever legislation will add speed and certainty in the execution of the law. When we deal with lynching even more Is necessary.- A great many white men are lynched, but tlie crime is peculiarly frequent in respect to' black men. The greatest existing cause of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black men, of the hideous crime of rape—the most abominable in all, the category pf crimes, even worse than murder. Mobs frequent ly avenge the commission of this crime by themselves torturing to- death the man committing it; thus avenging in bestial fashion a bestial deed, and reduc ing themselves to a level witli the crim inal. Lawlessness grows by what it feeds upon; and when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations and lynch for many other kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the lynehings are not for rape at all; while a considera ble proportion of the individuals lynched are innocent of all crime. Gov. Candler, of Georgia, stat ed on one occasion some years ago: "I can say of a verity that 1 have, within the last month, saved the lives of half a dozen Innocent negroes who were pursued by the mob, and brought them to trial in a court of law in which they were acquitted." As Bishop Gal loway, of Mississippi, has finely said: "When the rule of a mob obtains, that which distinguishes a high civilization is surrendered. The mob which lynch es a negro charged with rape will In a little while lynch a white man sus pected of crime. Every Christian pa triot in America needs to lift up his volee in loud and eternal protest against the mob spirit that Is threat ening the integrity of this republic." Oov. Jelks, of Alabama, has recently spoken as follows: "The lynching of any person for whatever crime is in excusable anywhere—It is a defiance of orderly government; but the killing,of innocent people under any provocation infinitely more horrible; and yet in nocent people are likely to die when a mob's terrible lust Is once aroused. The lesson is this: No good citizen can afford to countenance a defiance of the statutes, no matter what the provoca tion. The innocent frequently suffer, and, it is my observation, more usual ly suffer than the guilty. The white people of the south Indict the whole colored race on the ground that even the better elements lend no assistance whatever in ferreting out criminals of their own color. The respectable col ored people must learn not to harbor their criminals, but to assist the offi cers In bringing them to justice. This is the larger crime, and. it provokes such atrocious offenses as the one at Atlanta. The two races can never get on until there is an understanding on the part of both to cause with the law-abiding criminals of any color." Danger of Race Hatred. Moreover, whore any crime commit ted by a memoer of one race against a member of another race is avenged in such fashion that it seems as if not the individual criminal, but the whole race. Is attacked, the result Is to exas perate to the highest degree' race feel ing. There is but one safe rule in dealing with black men as with white men; It Is the same rule that must be applied in dealing with rich men and poor men; that is, to treat each man, whatever his color, his creed, or his social position, with even-handed jus tice on his real worth as a man. White people owe it quite as much to theni selves as to the colored race to treat well the colored man who shows by his life that he deserves such treat ment; for it is surely the highest wis dom to encourage in the colored race all those Individuals who are honest, industrious, law-abiding, and who therefore make good and safe neigh bors and citizens. Reward or punish the Individual on his merits as an in Evil will surely come in the end to both races if we substitute for this just rule the habit of treating all the members of the race, good and bad. alike. There is no question of "social equality 1 or "negro domination" involved: only the question of relent lessly punishing bad men. and of se curing to the good man the right to his life, his liberty, and the pursuit of his happiness as his own qualities of heart, head and hand enable him to achieve it. Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race is the negro criminal, and above all the ne gro criminal who commits the dread ful crime of rape; and it should be felt as in the highest degree an offense against the whole country, and against the colored race in particular, for a colored man to fail to help the officers of the law in hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal, every such infamous offender. Moreover, in my judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, as is the case with murder; assault with in tent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least in the discretion of the court; and provision should be made by which the punishment may follow' immediately upon the heels of the offense; while the trial should be so conducted that the victim need not be wantonly shamed while giving tes timony, and that the least possible publicity shall be given to the details. The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands of civ ilization; that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell therein. No man can take part in the torture of a hu man being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means just so much moral deterioration in all the children who have any knowledge of it. and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next generation of Americans. Let justice be both sure and swift; but let it be justice under the law, and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob. IN make common dividual. Need for Negro Education. There is another matter which has a direct bearing upon this matter of lynching and of the brutal crime which sometimes calls it forth and at other times merely furnishes the excuse for its existence. It is out of the question for our people as a whole permanently to rise by treading down any of their own number. Even those who them selves for the moment profit by such maltreatment of their fellows will in the long run also suffer, shortsighted policy can than, in the fancied interest of class; to prevent the education of an other class. The free public school, the chance for each boy or girl to get a good elementary education, lies at the foundation of our whole political situ ation. In every community the poor est citizens, those who need the schools most, would be deprived of them if they only received school facilities proportionately to the taxes they paid. This is as true of one portion of our country as of another. It is as true for the negro as for the white man. The white man, if he is wise, will de cline to allow the negroes in a mass to grow to manhood and womanhood without education. Unquestionably ed ucation such as is obtained in our pub lic schools does not do everything to wards making a man a good citizen; but it does much. The lowest and most brutal criminals, those for instance who commit the crime of rape, are in the great majority men who have had either no education or very litle; just as they are almost invariably men who own no property; for the man who puts money by out of his earnings, like the man who acquires education, is usually lifted above mere brutal criminality. Of course the best type of education for the colored man, ta ken as a whole, is such education is conferred in schools like Hampton and Tuskegee; where the boys girls, the young men and young wo men. are trained industrially as well 'n the ordinary public branches. The graduates schools turn out well in the great ma jority of cases, and hardly any of them become criminals, while what little criminality there is never takes the form of that brutal violence which in vites 'lynch law. Every graduate Of these schools—and for the matter of that every oher colored man or man—who leads a life so useful and honorable as to win the good will and respect of those whites whose neigh bor he or she is. thereby helps the whole colored race as it can be helped in no other way; for next to the himself, the man wli No more be imagined one and school of these wo negro can do most to help the negro is his white neighbor who lives near him; and our steady effort should be to hotter the relations between the two. Great tho the bene fit of these schools has been to their colored pupils and to tho colored peo ple, it may well be questioned whether the benefit has not been at least as great to the white people among whom these colored pupils live after they graduate. Exciting Mob Vengeance. Be it remembered, further, that the individuals who. whether from folly, from evil temper, from greed for office or in a spirit of mere base demagogy indulge in the inflammatory and incen^ diary speeches and writings which tend to arouse mobs and to bring about lynching, not only thus excite the mob but also tend by what criminologists call "suggestion," greatly to increase the likelihood of a repetition of the very crime against which they are in veighing. When the mob is composed of the people of one race and the man lynched is of another race, the men who in their speeches and writings either excite or justify the action tend of course, to excite a bitter race feel ing and to cause the people of the op posite race to lose sight of the abom inable act of the criminal himself; and In addition, by the prominence they give to the hideous deed they doubtedly tend to excite In other bru tal and depraved natures thoughts of committing It. Swift, relentless and orderly punishment under the law is the only way by which criminality of un The Preaching of Class Distinction Is this type can permanently be sup press 

CAPITAL AND LABOR. Severely Condemned. In dealing with both labor and capi tal, with the questions affecting both corporations and trade unions, there is one matter more Important to re member than aught else, and that is the infinite harm done by preachers of mere discontent. These are the men who .seek to excite a violent class hatred against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise and proper movements for the better control of corporations and for doing away with the abuses connected with wealth, Into a campaign of hysterical excitement and falsehood in which the aim is to inflame to madness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogs and foolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign of destruction sometimes seek to associ ate themselves with those working for a genuine reform in governmental and social methods, and sometimes mas querade as such reformers. In reality they are the worst enemies of the cause they profess to advocate, Just as the purveyors of sensational slander in newspaper and magazine are the worst enemies of all men who are en gaged in an honest effort to better what is bad in our social and govern mental conditions. To preach hatred of the rich man as such, to carry on a campaign of slander and invective against him, to seek to mislead and Inflame to madness honest men whose lives are hard and who have not the kind of mental * training which will f iermit them to appreciate the danger n the doctrines preached—all this is to commit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthy principle and tradition of American national life. Moreover, while such preaching and such agitation may give a livelihood and a certain notoriety to some of those who take part in it. and may result in temporary political success of others, in the long run every such movement will either fail will provoke a violent reaction, which will itself result not merely in undoing the mischief wrought by the demagog and the agitator, but also in undoing the good that the honest reformer, the true upholder of popular rights, has painfully and laboriously achieved. Corruption is never so rife as in com munities where the demagog and the agitator bear full sway, because in such communities all moral bands be come loosened, and hysteria and sen sationalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as between man and man. In sheer revolt against the squalid anarchy thus produced men are sure in the end to turn to ward any leader who can restore order, and then their relief at being free from the intolerable burdens of class hatred, violence and demagogy is such that they cannot for some time be aroused to indignation against mis deeds by men of wealth; so that they permit a new growth of the very abuses which were in part responsible for the original outbreak. The one hope for success for our people lies in a resolute and fearless, but sane and cool-headed advance along the path marked out last year by this very con gress. There must be a stern refusal to be misled into following either that base creature who appeals and panders to the lowest instincts and passions in order to arouse one set of Americans against their fellows, or that other creature, equally base but no baser, who in a spirit of greed, or to accu mulate or add to an already huge fortune, seeks to exploit his fellow Americans with callous disregard to their welfare of soul and body. The man who debauches others in order to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruption with the man who debauches others for financial profit; and when hatred is sown the crop which springs up can only be evil. or else Duty of the People. The plain people who think—the mechanics, farmers, merchants, work ers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe it to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be given pop ular government is to elect an un worthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever such an issue is raised in this country nothing can be gained by flinching from it. for in such case dem ocracy is itself on trial, popular self government under republican forms is itself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just as evil a thing as the tri umph of the plutocracy, and to have escaped one danger avails nothing whatever if we sucuumb to the other. In the end the honest man,whether rich or poor, who earns his own living and tries to deal justly by his fellows, has as much to fear from the insincere and unworthy demagog, promising much and performing nothing, or else performing nothing but evil, who would set on the mob to plunder the rich, as from the crafty corruptionist, who. for his own ends, would permit the common people to be exploited by the very wealthy. If we ever let this government fall into the hands of men of either of these two classes, we shall show ourselves false to America's past. Moreover, the demagog and corrup tionist often work hand in hand. There are at this moment wealthy reaction aries of such obtuse morality that they regard the public servant who prose cutes them when they violate the law, or who seeks to make them bear their proper share of the public burdens, as being even more objectionable than the violent agitator who hounds on the mob to plunder the rich. There is nothing to choose between such a re actionary and such an agitator; funda mentally they are alike In their selfish disregard of the rights of others; and it is natural that they should Join in opposition to any movement of which the aim is fearlessly to do exact and even justice to all. Railroad Employees' Hoars. I call your attention to the need of passing the bill limiting the number of hours of employment of railroad employees. The measure 4s a very moderate one and I can conceive' of no serious objection to it. Indeed, so far as it is in our power, it should be our aim steadily to reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general introduction of an eight-hour day. There are industries in which it is not possible that the hours of labor should be reduced; just as there are communities not far enough ad vanced for such a movement to be for their good. or. if in the tropics, so sit uated that here is no analogy between their needs and ours in this matter. On the isthmus of Panama, for in stance. the conditions are in every way so different from what they are here that an eight-hour day would be ab surd; just as it is absurd, so far as the isthmus is concerned, where white la bor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work is done by alien black men or by alien yellow men. But the wageworkers of the United States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely Industrial standpoint and from the civic stand point it should be our object to do what we can in the direction of secur ing the general observance of an eight hour day. Until recently the eight hour law on our federal statute books has been very scantily observed. Now, however, largely thru the instrumen tality of the bureau of labor, it is be ing rigidly enforced, and I shall speed ily be able to say whether or not there is need of further legislation in reference thereto; for our purpose is to see it obeyed in spirit no less than in letter. Half holidays during summer , should be established for government employees; it is as desirable for wage workers who toil with their hands as for salaried officials whose labor is mental that there should be a reasona ble amount of holiday. Labor of Women nod Children. The congress at its last session wise ly provided for a truant court for the District of Columbia; a marked step in advance on the path of properly caring for the children. Let me again urge that the congress provide for a thoro investigation of the conditions of child labor and of the labor of women in the United States. More and more our people are growing to recognize the fact that the questions which are not merely of idustrinl but of social im portance outweigh all others; and these two questions most emphatically come in the category of those hlch affect in the moat far-reaching way the home life of the nation. The hor rors incident to the employment of young children In factories or at work anywhere are a blot on our civiliza tion. It la true that each state must ultimately settle the question in Its own way; but a thoro official investi gation of the matter, with the results published broadcast, would greatly help toward arousing the public con science and securing unity of state action in the matter. There is, how ever, one law on the subject which should be enacted Immediately, be cause there is no need for an investi gation In reference thereto, and the failure to enact it is discreditable to the national government. A drastic and thorogoing child-labor law should be enacted for the District of Colum bia and the territories. Employers' Liability. Among the excellent laws which th* congress past at the last session was a employers' liability law. It was g marked step In advance to get the rec ognition of employers' liability on the statute books; but the law did hot go far enough. In spite of all precau tions exercised by employers there are unavoidable accidents and even deaths involved in nearly every line of busi ness connected with the mechanic arts. This inevitable sacrifice of life may be reduced to a minimum, but it cannot be completely eliminated. It is a great social injustice to compel the employes, or rather the family of the killed or disabled victim, to bear the entire bur den of an Inevitable sacrifice. In other words, society shirks is duty by laying the whole cost on the victim, whereas the Injury comes from what may b* called the legitimate risks of trade. Compensation for accidents or deaths due in any line of industry to the actual conditions under which that industry is carried on, should be paid by that por tion of the community for the benefit of which the industry is carried on—■ that is, by those who profit by the in dustry. If the entire trade risk is placed upon the Employer he will promptly and properly add it to the legitimate cost of production and as sess it proportionately upon the con sumers of his commodity. It is there fore shoul trade" upon the employer. Neither the federal law, nor, as far as I am in formed, the state laws dealing with the question of employers' liability are sufficiently thorogoing. The federal law should of course include em ployees in navy-yards, arsenals, and the like. clear to my mind that the law J place this entire "risk of a Investigation of Disputes. The commission appointed by the presi dent October 16, 1902, at the request of both the anthracite coal operators and miners to inquire into, consider, and pass upon the question in controversy in con nection with the strike in the anthracite regions of Pennsylvania and the causes out of which the controversy arose, In their report, findings, and award exprest the belief "that the state and federal governments should provide the ma chinery for what may be called the com pulsory investigation of controversies be tween employers and employees when they arise," This expression of belief is deserving of the favorable considera tion of the congress and the enactment of its provisions into law. A bill has already been introduced to this end. Records show that during the 20 years from January 1. 1881, to December 31, 1900, there were strikes affecting 117, 509 establishments, and 6,105,694 employees were thrown out of employment, ing the same period there were lockouts, involving nearly 10,000 estab lishments, throwing over 1,000,000 people out of employment. These strikes and lockouts involved an estimated loss to employees of $307,000,000 and to employers of $143,000,000, a total of $450,000,000. The public suffered directly and indirectly probably as great additional loss. But the money loss, great as it was, did not measure the anguish and suffering en dured by the wives and children of em ployees whose pay stopt when their work stopt, or the disastrous effect of the strike or lockout upon the business of employers, or the increase in the cost of products and the inconvenience and loss to the public. Many of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred had the parties to the dispute been required to appear before an unprejudiced body representing the nation and, face to face, state the reasons for their contention. In most instances the dispute would doubtless be found to be due to a misunderstanding by each of the other's rights, aggravated by an unwillingness of either party to ac cept as true the statements of the other as to the justice or injustice of the mat ters in dispute. The exercise of a ju dicial spirit by a disinterested body representing the federal government, such as would be provided by a commis sion on conciliation and arbitration would tend to create an atmosphere of friendliness and conciliation between con tending parties; and the giving each side an equal opportunity to present fully its case in the presence of the other would prevent many disputes from developing into serious strikes or lockouts, and in other cases, would enable the commis sion to persuade the opposing parties to come to terms. In this age of great corporate and la bor combinations, neither employers nor employees should be left completely at the mercy of the stronger party to a dis pute, regardless of the righteousness of their respective claims. The proposed measure would be in the line of securing recognition of the fact that in many strikes the public has Itself an interest which cannot wisely be disregarded; an interest not merely of general conven ience, for the question of a just and proper public policy must also be con sidered. In all legislation of this kind it is well to advance cautiously, testing each step by the actual results; the step propbsed can surely be safely taken, for the decisions of the commission would not bind the varties in legal fashion, and yet would g < e a chance for public opin ion to exert its full force for the right. Withdrawal of Coal Lands. Dur 1.005 It is not wise that the nation should alienate its remaining coal lands. I have temporarily, withdrawn from settle ment all the lands which the geological survey has indicated as containing, or In all probability containing, coal. The question, however, can be properly set tled only by legislation, which in my judgment should provide for the with drawal of these lands from sale or from entry, save in certain especial circum stances. Th* ownership would than remain in the United States, which should not, however, attempt to work them, but permit them to be worked by private individuals under a royalty sys tem, the government keeping such control as to permit it to see that no excessive price was charged consumers. It would of course be as necessary to supervise the rates charged by the com mon carriers to transport the product as the rates charged by those who mine it; and the supervision must extend to the conduct of the common carriers, so that they shall in no way favor one competi tor at the expense of another. The with drawal of these coal lands would consti tute a policy analagous to that which has been followed in withdrawing the forest lands from ordinary settlement. The coal, like the forests, should be treated as the property of the public and its dis posal should be under conditions which would inure to the benefit of the public as a whole. 

CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS. Recommends Some Minor Changes In Laws Recently Enacted. The present congress has taken long strides in the direction of securing er supervision and conti ol national government over prop by the >1 . . . . . corporations engaged in interstate business—and the enormous majority of corporations any size are engaged in interstate busi ness. The passage of the railway rate bill and only to a less degree the passage of the pure food bill, and the provision for increasing and rendering more effec tive national control over the beef packing industry, mark an important advance in the proper direction. In the short session it will perhaps be difficult to do much further along this line- and It may be best to wait until the'laws have been in operation for a number of months before endeavoring to increase their scope, because only operation will show with exactness their merits and their shortcomings and thus give oppor tunity to define what further remedial legislation is needed. Yet In my judg' ment it will n the end be advisable In connection with the packing house in spection law to provide for putting a date on the label and for charglnr the cost of Inspection to the packers. of All
