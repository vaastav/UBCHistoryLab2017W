Another darirg train robbery has occurred in Texas. Senators Stanford and Stewart have prepared several Pacific coast bills. Her. Mr. Berry, of England, has declined the Plymouth Church pastorate. An attempt was made on Saturday to assassi nate M. Ferry iv Paris. The Crown Prince's throat is said to be heal ing. The jury in the McCord case, in San Francisco has again tailed to agree. THE SLAVE CASES TO BE HEARD. At San Francisco on Saturday :t large number of the female slaves held on one of the i-teamers by eustonLs officers, and prevented from landing, were before the I'nited States Circuit Court on writs of habeas corpus, sworn out, of course, by in terested slave masters. For :i time it ap peared as if there was to foe a conflict of authority between customs and judicial officers, and perhaps resistance by the Col lector of tin- Port tv the orders of the Court. Bat this was avoided, and the women, pending the hearing of the cases, are to be transferred to and detained on a steamship of the passenger' company that remains in the harbor, while that they leave is to sail. Judge Sawyer well re marked that until it is determined that the women are to Ite landed or remanded, the carrier who brought tlipm here must con tinue to keep them in < ustody. They are to be permitted to consult with their counsel — though that is a farce, the poor wretches not even knowing what " coun sel" is, nor have tliey any idea whatever of the relations of client and attorney; but they are not to l>c approached without consent of the Court, and the Court ought to see to it that no Chinese slave-broking ngents manage to get the ear of these women. If that is permitted, even through the fiction of " counsel," they will be terrorized and made to testify to whatever the masters desire. One of the very lx.'.st suggestions in the entire matter came from I'uited States I *i.-trii L Attorney Carey, who asked for an order of Court that the slaves l« photographed, in order that no ex changes can l>e made. The Court con curred with him, and thug an effectual check is pat upon the old-time game of passing oil Old bags whom the slavers are glad to have sent back to China, for young and likely Blares. It no >r looks as if the eases al>out to Ik? heard will result in the complete exposure of the inner workings of the whole infamous Chinese slave trade. The customs authorities are understood to be thoroughly prepared and ready for the contest, while the slave-dealers are em ploying all manner of influences, together with money and chicanery, to compass their defeat. They do not stand at cor ruption fur an instant, and if they can buy the slaves oat of the grasp of the law they will do so. Perjnry has do terrors for them, and they swear to any desired state of facts with amazing nonchalance. The Federal I 'ourt.-. announce that they arc deeply interested in the matter, and pro po» to sift it to the bottom, and as a first step have refused to admit the women to bail. Th:it procedure in the p:t.st has been the means of landing not a few who Otherwise would now he back in China. Judge Sawyer on Saturday said from the ('irrnit bench : None of these women will be allowed to go at large on bail. If they waut to return to China they eai! do SO. ii they ilo not they will be con- Bned until their eases are disposed of. and this whole subject thoroughly Investigated. We do not propose to be imposed upon it we can help lt.br this claw of people. I do not proposeto discharge these "women on bail or let them ro out ofth. custody of the Marshal. I propose to uivr the Collector and District Attorney every lacility for fei rot Ing out thcie ensus nnd* liuding out if these women have h light to land, ami punishing any offense if any has !>eeu com mitted, l have become suspidoas from the Urge number of these women arriving that there is some Imposition practiced, and I pro pose to make an Investigation as to the number of women who have pone away. ( laufobku i.s to be congratulated upon the anointment <>f Senator Stanford to tin- Chairmanship <>f the Committee on I'ublic Building*. Hi-, hi^li business capacity, his knowledge of the needs of California and the justice of her claims for Federal attention will in his now position secure for the State ;i hearing as to public buildings that it bag not before obtained. It may be barely possible that the very unfortunate hitch which has brought the erection of the Federal building in this city to .-i standstill, can be overcome so that we shall not havo to wait two years longer before tlio work will be commenced. Hie appropriation for the public building in Sacramento p:used without diffi culty; the mi.' was selected and the money paid, and at a time when the Legislature v. - in session. After its adjournment, however, it was learned from Washington that no further step* otmld be taken until the I J esi>lature ceded, by formal act, all jurisdiction over the property, to the Fed e-al Government. Aj the Legislature does not meet until 1 8 S'.t the chances for getting th. work under way before 1890, or four yean after the making of the ap propriation l>ecame very poor. The regulation is a wise one. aud all that. but it does soem that some arrangement ought to be made by which tiie delay can be avoided. The t Government :\.-. well as the city torn by tin- unfortunate blunder, and yet, at the proper department at Washington foiled to call the attention of the State to the matter, thoogh tlu» latter is presumed to know the law, it does appeal U 1* a great hardship that for lack o> a simple formality a -.■rclv-needed public work should come to a standstill. The appro priation was in the first place too small, and the oost of a pro|>er sit.- haa proveil it. It is probable that it will l>e increased at the present > ; .:ioi> and :::.i! to give us a Federal buDding here commen surate with the needs of the departmeata and the character and stead/ growth c.i" the city.

PROFANITY. Take Not the Name of the Lord thy God In Vain. Rev. R. L McHatton, pastor of the ! Christian Church on Eighth street, between ' N and O, in a sermon on cursing, among other things said : It is distressingly sad to observe how prevalent is the sin of pro fane sweating. You cannot walk down X street without hearing some one profane | the name of our God. All classes are ' addicted to the habit. Little boys are not ' far behind their fullgrown companions. : Even women forget their moral superiority ! and take in vain the name of that one who is their Supreme Friend. Men in high ! position, as well as those in the meanest i paths of life, lift up their voices in dishon oring God. It is sad to have to say that this is a profane nation. Kngland is not j much belter and Continental Europe is still worse. Once a Hindoo dignitary visited England, and when he returned TO HIS HEATHEN HOME Wrote a letter, in which he said : " The English are a most religious nation, since they continually cail upon the Supreme Being." The man who cannot swear is said to be ineligible to a mateship on a Mississippi steamboat. Parrot's are taught to swear, and to use profanity is the first thing that the Chinaman learns. Even in fidels, who claim there is no God, are ex perts in defaming the came of him whom they say does not exist. Profanity seems to be on the increase. With the secular izing of the Lord's Day has come an in crease of drunkenness, murder and profan ity. When a man uses this holy day for picnics, excursions and all kinds of games, prize fights and baseball, he soon learns to hate that One to whom this day belongs. HE FORGETS THE CHURCH And "ler moral instruction, and soon openly curses by the God so much revered by the better element of this nation. Any use of tl.e name of the Deity, other than in wor ship, instruction, adoration, respect, or that required by the civil government, is curs ing. It is just as much a sin to curse by Jesus Christ as it is by His Father. Cursing is calling upon God toannihilate somebody. If you get mad at your horse, you ask the Lord to damn the poor creature. Now sup pose he would answer that prayer — may, you would lose your hoise. You quarrel with a fellow-man, and in your anger you call upon the Great Kuler to destroy him. How would you feel if your enemy should drop dead at your feet? You would flee from the presence of the Almighty. I have heard men ask the Lord to DAMN THEIR OWN CUILDREN. What is meant by that word " damn " as used in this sense? It is asking God to send some one to hell and to keep him there forever. Stop and consider what you are doing. You would not have God send your child there ; you would not desire your neighbor to live with the devil ; you would uot ask to have your worst enemy sent to that dreadful place. Hen who are perfect gentlemen in other respects, have contracted this foolish and wicked habit. Others curse because they think it is manly. Some boys think they are men when he can raise a mustache, smokes his first cigarette, and takes his first dram. The bully of the community is the champion swearer, and the younger loafing element admire and imitate him. Swearing is use less; there is nothing to be gained by this evil practice. It does not make your lan guage more beautiful or forcible. it is vuloar. If it is useless and vulgar and there is no reason for it, it is inexcusable. It is dis honoring God. When your child uses vul gar language correct him. Keep him out of company that swears until lie has formed his character, and burn every dime novel that you can lay your hands upon. In many of tueiu the heroes are the worst of characters, and use vulgar and profane language. In contrast with the dienataries of our day those of our earlier history are far superior. I wish to call a witness that must be respected by every true American one whose name stands at the very head of patriots. From his quiet tomb we must call that one who is justly denominated the Father of his country. Here is an army order of George Washington: lIKAiHiVAHTEHS, MOORE'S llorsK I West point. July 20. 1799. / Mauy and pointed orders have been issued against that unmeaning and abominable cus tom of swearing, notwithstanding, with great regret, the General observes that it prevails, if possible, more than ever; his feelings are con tinually wounded by the oaths and imprecations of the soldiers whenever he is in hearing of them. The name of that Being from whose bouutiiul Koodaess we arc permitted to exist and enjoy the comforts of life, is incessantly im precated and profaned in a manner that is as ivaiutm as it is shocking. For the sake there fore of religion, decency and order, the Gen eral hopes aud trusts that the ollicers of every rank will use their influence aud authority to check a vice which is as unprofitable as it is wicked mid shameful. If the officers would raake it an unavoidable rule to reprimand, and if that does not do. punish soldiers for offenses of this kind, it could not fail of having the >Il sired effect. GKOBGE Wasiii.nc.ton. You have seen the utter uselessness, the reai vulgarity, and alarming influence of this sin ; will you not promise me to 1! sis) from Mich an unclean practice? For the sake of your own temporal welfare, as you love your wife and children, and us you prize the future <jf your nation, 1 beg of you cease to profane the nunie of God, who has blessed you. protected your family, and guided the affairs of our" Republic. We cannot expect a continuation of His favors if we disregard His plainly-published com mand. God cannot bold him guiltless who takes His name in vain. SOCIAL AND PERSONAL.

Hkcord-Union : It was to be ex ' pected that so important a public document as the President's recent message would receive general attention; it was not surpris ing that it should be criticised and unfavor ably commented upon by those holding j different views; but the deteirniued effort ' to misrepresent the President's utterances, and the persistent falsification of his views j by the Republican press, ia as astonishing ■ as it is scandalou3aud disgraceful. Nothing , better ought to be expected, perhans, from ; the followers of the " Plumed Knight," j when their leader hastened, with indecent precipitation, to attack and demolish the President's views and recommendations j before he knew with certainty what they ■were. He was so anxious to get the ear of I the American people in advance of other j candidates for the Republican nomination j for the Presidency, that, upon no better i authority than a mere telegraphic abstract ! of the message— which was necessarily ira i perfect and obviously incorrect — he "bast ! ened to be interviewed, and dispatched at once his " corker" by telegraph to his organ in New York. Having thus put himself in the forefront of the Republican party, and stolen a march on John Sherman by strat egy, and having sounded the keynote, fair play could no more be expected from his followers than a stream could be ex pected to rise above its source. The people are told that Mr. Cleveland's policy will ruin the country ; that he ad vocates free trade : that, if his policy pre vails, our manufacturing interests will be ruined ; that American laborers are to be compelled to compete with foreign labor at reduced wages, and in the end starved to death. In short, that the whole country is to be railroaded to the "demnition bow wows.' Neither Mr. Utaine nor his lieu tenants quote from the President's message to sustain their charges, lor the very excel lent reason that they can rind nothing in it to suit their purposes. They prefer to set up a man of straw of their own making, label him " President Cleveland," and th?u proceed to mock at and deride and spit upon him. Now, what are the facia. The country is being taxed beyond the needs of the Gov ernment, and a large surplus is accumu lating ia the National Treasury. Heretofore the Burploa lias been used to redeem the bonds of the Government and ilius reduce the national debt, but all the bonds which could be taken up at the option of the Gov ernment have beea redeemed, and nothing is left to absorb the surplus which continues to accumulate. On the first of the present month this surplus amounted to $55,218, --871 19, and the estimate of the Treasur'v Department is that— on the first of Jane next— it will amount to $1 lo.U'XUXxj. Un less Congress resorts to wild or extravagant measure? to use up this surplus, and pro vides for the reduction of taxation, it must continue to increase, and the money which should be in the channels of trade will be locked up in the Government's vaults This is an alarming state of affairs and must speedily result in a financial crisis widespread ruin and universal distress, un less measures are adopted to stop thi hoarding and prevent it in future. The revenues of the Government are derived from two sources— a tarill' levied upon im ported goods and taxes upon tobacco and spirituous liquors. The President does r.ot recommend that the latter should be re leased from taxation, because, he says they are not, strictly speaking, necessaries! and there is no just came of complaint on the part of the consumers of those articles He favors rather a readjustment of the tariff on imports. He would reduce the revenues by a radical reduction of the duties imposed upon raw material use." in manufactures', or its free importation- by enlarging the tree list by including many articles not produced in the country and by making such reductions in duties as can safely be done without injury to manufact urers or imperiling the interest of the labor ing class. Particular attention is invited to his language in this connection. He says "ln a readjustment of our tariff the in terests of American labor engaged in man ufactures should be carefully considered as well as the preservation of'our manufact ures. It may be called protection or by any other name, but relief fr..m the hard ships and dangers of our present t.iriil laws should be devised with eepecitil pre caution against imperiling the existence of our manufacturing interests." He emphasizes this by leferring to it again in the following language: "But the reduction of taxation de manded should be so measured as not to ne cessitate or justify either the torn a/ employ meat tiy the worldngman /cr the lessening of his wage*, and the profits still remaining to the manufacturer, after a necessary I c idjust nient, should furnish no excuse fur the men fee of the interetti t>f liit employes in either tlnir opportunity to work or the diminution t>f their comj/ciwi'ttiou. ■■■ In the face of this piain language Mr. Blame and his satellites hold up their hands in holy horror, and declare that the President is the enemy of the manufact urers and the workingnien. Pah! If she policy of the President should be carried out, Hie manufacturers and workers would be benefited rather than injured. The free, introduction of the raw material wr.uld give a tremendous impetus to man ufacturing. The manufacturer would be able to produce bis goods at a cost us ranch less than at present as tlie amount of the tariff taken from the raw material. He would, therefore, be able to pay better wages to his employes :uid Btitl make as much profit as he now does; orheeodd pay them the same wsgfs he now doe and make a greater i>rt.t"n, or seii his goods at a less price to the consumer. Mure ihac this; it would enable many to enlarge their trade by successful competition in foreign markets. Isut this is not all. The intro duction of the raw material free of duty would revive ship-building, now driven al most out of existence by the high tarilF, and thus be the n.eans of giving profitable employment to millions of capital and thousands of men. All the gabble indulged in about free trade is unadulterated rot There is not a line in the President's message, nor an idea conveyed, which savors o! free trade. No candid, sensible man will pretend that there is, nor can the American people be •It i - ived by the hypocritical pretensions of demagogues to the contrary. The English press has been misled by an imperfect syn opsis of the message in connection* with Mr. Blame's remarkable "interview, but, upon receipt of the full message they will discover their mistake and whittle a differ ent tune. In conclusion, Messrs. Editors, permit me to say that 1 am amazed at the conduct of the Rnorwp-TJaiOB and the llee. Since when did they become the champions of protection? If my memory is not at f.tuit, the Keookd-I'nion has been at infinite pains to educate its readers in the doctrine and principles of free trade. I seem to re member reading some very able articles in its columns which preached the gospel of free trade. As for the Bee, it is a radical freetrader. It wants taxes of all kinds abolished exc?pt I pon "land, and would ad mit everything produced on the face of the globe free of duty. Still these two organs of public opinion are displeased with the President because, they say, he is in favor of free trade. How they" can iook their patrons in the lace without sharuefacedness and confusion, is more than I can under stand. J. r.
