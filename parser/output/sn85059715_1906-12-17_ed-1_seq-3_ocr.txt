K?T7 Protection For- the Paelle Coot How Under Diaciuudon?Mr. Kaha Aakn #5,000,000 For Sabnariae Torpedo Boat*-Hew IpelUas la Doomed By CHARLES W. ARTHUR Washington, Dec. 17. ? [Special.]? The proposed investigation of the so called lumber trust which is culled for in resolutions offered by 8enutor Kittredge of South Dakota and Representative Miller of Kansas Is perhaps of more general Interest than any similar movement which has been set on foot since the present agitation against great combinations of capital commenced. The only Investigation that approached It In this respect was that of the alleged beef trust. A very large percentage of the people In the United States do not use Any of the products of the Standard Oil company, for Instance, and so are not directly Interested In the prices charged by that concern, but nearly everybody eats meat, and everybody Is Interested In the cost of commodities snId to be controlled by the lumber trust. Everybody sits in a chair and eats from a table or writes from a desk or in some other way Is concerned as to whether the cost of wood manufactures is high or low. Mr. Kittredge and Mr. Miller appreciate this and are therefore of the opinion that something should be done at once. Prices are admittedly higher than in former years, and the purpose of the proposed Investigation. If It Is inaugurated, will be to disclose arhatliop n. tinf tilt* Illi-rtMKO In by conditions. Many members of congress are of the opinion that some very grave injustices will be uncovered If the mutter Is. gone Into thoroughly. Japanese Soaro Passed. The so called Jupanese scare seems to have passed over entirely. The legislators from California are uot talking about the president's message, which they so vigorously resented at first?that is, the part of it relating to the Japanese?and those prophets who persisted In declaring that the president was negotiating a new treaty with Japan despite denials from the highest possible source have at last quieted down. But there Is still an undercurrent of opinion to the effect that sooner or later we shall have trouble with Japan. When Representative Kahn of California introduced a bill appropriating $5,000,000 for the construction of submarine torpedo boats to be stationed along the Pacific coast he specifically disclaimed any thought of hostilities with Japan in the near future. Yet of course the friction over the Japanese school question in San j Francisco and the general "cockiness" j of the Japanese in the far west, to use a term which Californians say best j describes the attitude of the Nipponese j out there, were the factors which led j him to Introduce the bill. Diplomat- [ ically the situation is quite serene. The Japanese have been much impressed by President Roosevelt's warm expressions in his message. That is exactly the effect he wished to produce, so if there is an understanding between liiin and the California congress- j men conditions Tiinv be said to bo satis factory all around. Still many believe J it is unwise in the extreme to leave i our long Pacific coast line as nearly unprotected as it is. and there are numerous evidences that authorities generally are in favor of preparing; for possible war in these pipiug times of peace. Instead of beiug in the nature of a defiance they believe that the strengthening of our west count defenses will go further toward averting; hostilities in the future than any amount of diplouiucy. N?w Spoiling Doomed. The new, or simplified, form of spelling; put into effect by President Roosevelt hist summer Is decidedly not popnlur In congress, and there is little doubt that within the next few weeks both houses will act In such a way as to effectually prevent the use of the new form In official documents. Even the president's message, it appears, cannot be published with "thrus" and "thos" and "klsts" in it. Congress provides the money for government printing, and therefore, it is contended, iias ample power to say what form of spelling shall be observed, especially since the new method necessitates additional work, which increases the cost of all government documents in which it appears. If both houses do not accept that paragraph of the legislative, executive and judicial appropriation bill which stipulates that all spelling shall be according to Webster, the joint committee on printing will bring in a similar provision. The paragraph in the appropriation bill might go out on a point of order, but the other would have to be voted on, and welt Informed members say there Is no doubt of what the result would be in such au event. LittU Work Before Recess. Not a great deal of work will be done In the few days which intervene between this date and adjournment for the Christmas holidays. The legislative appropriation bill, which whs reported a week ago. will have been sent Liver to the senate from the house when the recess is taken, but aside from that little important legislation will bnve been enacted. The legislators will assemble again on .Tun. 3 after the two weeks' holiday, and then they will have to got clown to business in earnest In ardor to get through with what must be done before March 4.
