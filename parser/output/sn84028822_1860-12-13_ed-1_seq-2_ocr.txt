KANSAS AND UTAH. At the period of my inauguration I was con fronted in Kansas by a revolutionary government, existing under what is called tlio 1 npel;a consti tution. Its avowed object was to Biibdiic the ter ritorial government uy force, nnd, to hi lugurato what was called the Tupcka government in Its stend. To accomplish this object an extensive military orgnnlitliui wi formed, and ita cotu inind entrusted to the mol ilnlcnt revolutionary leaders. Under these ciicumstnnces. It became mv Imperative duty to exert the whole coiistitu tlntml power of tho Kxccutho to prevent tho flames of civil war f om again raging In Kansas, which in the excited Mute of the public mind both North and South, might, have extended into the nclglihoiing Str.tcs. The hostile parlies in Kansas had been Inflamed against each oilier bv cmlsarics both from the Nortluind the South, to a degree of maliguity wtthout n parallel In our history. To prevent actual collision, and to assist the civil magistrates in enforcing tho laws, n strong detachment ot tlio army was stationed in tho Territory, ready to aid the marshal and his deputies when lawfully called upnn,ns a posse enmitat us In thu execution of civil and criminal process. Still, the troubles in Kansas could not have been permanently settled without an election bv the people. Tho ballot box Is the surrcst arbiter of disputes among freemen. Under this eonvlc tion, every proper effort was employed to Induce the hostile parties to veto at tlio election of dele gates t-i framo a Statu constitution, and after. wnrds at the election to decide whether Kiinsis should ho a slave or a free State. The insurgent party lofnsed to vote nt either, lest this might bu i-oiiiiilertd a recognition on their part of tlio Tor rilmial government established by Congress.. A better sphit, however, seemed soon after to pie vail, nnd tho two parties met face to I'nco nt the tliinl eh-clinn, held on the fust Monday of Jaiiil ary, Hft", fur members of Ihn I.t-gislntuio nud Statu nllleers under the I.cconipton conMitiition. The result was tho triumph of tho niitl-slavorv mrtv nt thn polls. This decision ol the ballot- hox'proved clearly that this partv weio in tho majority, and rcmovou -no iinnier ol civil war. Krom that tlmn we h.ivo hoard little or nothing nl tho Topcka government; nnd all erious danger of revolutionary troubles lu Kansas wus then at an end, Tho I.ecnmpton constitution, which had been thus recognised at this Stale election by tho voles ofhnth polilie.il parties In Kansas, was transmit ted to mo wllh the request thai 1 should present it to Congress, 'i hs I could not luvo rctused to do without ilohiting my clearest and strongest convictions nl duty, iho constitution, and all the proceedings which preceded nnd followed its for mation wero fnlr and regular o-i theh- face. I then believed, and experience has proven, that tie Interests nf tho pcoplo of Kansas would bine been best consulted bv Its admission us a State in In the Union, especially as the majority, within n brief peiio I, could have amended tlio coustitiiti u according to their will nnd pleasure. II fraud existed in nil or aiiv of theso proceedings. It was not fortlic 1'iosidciit, but for Countess, to luvcstl gate nud determine tho question of fraud and whit ou;ht to lie Ita consequences. If, nt tho two first elections, thn majoritv icfuscd to cxeiclse (tin elective fmuchlsn could iuinlid.ile an election fairly hold under lawful nnthorlly, even If the) had not subsciiucntly voted at the thinl election It Is true that Ihe whnlo constitution had not been submitted to the peoplo, as I always desired; but the precedents nro numerous nf tho admission of States Into the Union without such submission. It would not comport with mv present purpose to rovlcw tho proceedings of Congress upon the I.eeompton constitution. It is sufficient to observe that tholr final action has removed the vestige ol serious revolutionary troubles. Tho dcsiior.itc hand recently assembled under a notorious outlaw, in the Southern portion of the Territory, torestst tlm execution nf Iho laws and to plunder peaceful rltUens, will, I doubt not, bo spcdlly subdued and brought Injustice. Had I treated tho I.ccomptlo.i Constitution as a utility and refused tn submit It to Congress, It Is not not dilTicult lniauinci whilst recalling tlio po ultion of the country nt that moment, what would h.no been tho disastrous coiiscouenses, both in and nut of the Territory, from such a ilcrltiction of duty on tho p.ii tof the Kiecutlvo, IVnre hn been restored within tho Territory of Utah, which, at the commencement of my admin istration, wns In n state of open rebellion. This was the more dangerous as tho people animated bv a fanatical spirit and entrenched within tholr (llxtiint mountain fastnesses migh have made n long nnd formidable resistance, tost what It nileht. it was necessary lo hi ins thorn into suire- mill III llio uuiuuuiliuu em mu ions, ouuiiu im lev therefore, as well ns humanity, required, lint this object shmild, II possinio, no nrcomputiieii without tho effusion of blood. This could only lie effected bv sendlfli; a military force into tho Territory sulricloutlj strong to convince mo people that resistance would bo hopeless, niul nt the same llmo to offer them ft pardon for past ofTen cos on condition of Immediate submission to tho ton eminent. This Dollev was minuet! wilh eml ncnt success; and the onlj cause for regret Is the heavy expenditure required to inarch a large de- tatchmcnt ol tne army to nisi remote region ami to turulih It sntisistance. Utali is now compata lively peaceful and quiet, nnd the military force has been withdrawn, except Ihat portion ol It ne cessary to keep the Indians in check and protect llie'einlgraut trains on the way to our l'aciuo pos sessions. 

FINANCES. In 'iny first annual inossago I promisei! to eiuiilov my best oxeitluns, in co-operation with Congress, lo reduce the expenditures of thu governmeut within thu limits ot a wise and. judicious 6?onumv. An overflowing treasury hat produced publts of prodigality am! oxtravitmnco which. could only bo grad ually, cprruotud.

Whilst Iho books of tlio Treasury show on actual I'zpeiiilliiiro of S.i-,,818,474 72 for Ihe year ending mi tho 80th June, 1M0, in eluding $I,010,C07 70 for tho contingent ex ponses of Congress, thoio must bo deducted Irom this amount the stun of 54,1200,000 W, ' with thu Interest Upon. It of $150,000 uppro pilated by tho act of tho l.itli February, 18C0 "lor the purpose supplying the deficiency In' the revenue and defraying tho expenses of tho Post-office Department for tho year ending 30th Juno, 1860." This sum, thcrol'oro, just ly chargeable to tho year 1839, must bu de ducted liom the sum of $50,848,474 G3, in order to ascertain thu expondlturos for tho year, ending on tho 30th Juno, 1800, which leaves a balance for tho expenditures of that year ol $55,402,405 40. Tho Interest on tho public uoot, including treasury notes lor mo aamu fiscal juar ending- 80th Juno,, 18C0, amounted to $;), 177,314, 02, which, added to tho nbnvu sum of $55,102,405 40, makes the aggregate of $58,570,7cO 08 It ought injustice to bo observed that sov oral of thu estimates from the departments for thu yuar ending 30th Juno, 1800, wuru ro-1 duced, by Con. rex below what was and still I ductm-it compatlblo with thupiitnic interest. , Allowing a liberal margin ol $2,.uu,uuu lor this reduction and for other causus, it may ' be safoly asserted that the sum of $G1, 000,001), i or nl inu most u2,uuu,uuu,,isainpiy suiuuiuui i to administer the covcrnmcnt and to pay tho interest on the nubile dobt .unless contlngunt events should hereafter render extraordinary expenditures necessary. This result bus been attalno I In a consider able degree by tho care exercised by tlio ap . proprlato departments In entering Into public contracts. I havo myself never interfered with the award of any such contract except in a single c.iso with thu colonization society deeming It advisable to cast thu wholu res ponsibility in each casoon tho proper head i l tho depaitinunt, with tho general instruction that these contracts should always bu given to tho lowest and best bidder. It has ever been my opinion th.it public contracts aro not a Icgittmato source of patronage to bo conferred upon pcrsonalorpolltlc.il livoritus but that in ull such cases a public otlicur is bound to act lor the government asu prudent individual would act for himself. AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE, ETC. It It with great satisfaction I communicate tho fact, that slnco tho ihtu ol my lust annual message, not a single slavo has boun import ed into tho United States, In violation of tliu laws prohibiting thu Afi lean slavo trade. This statement Is founded upon a thorough examination and Invnstlgatlon of tho subjuct. Indued, thu spirit which pruvailed somo timo slnco among a portion of our follow-cltlzuns in favor of this tradu teems to havo entirely subsided. I also congratulate you upon tho pullc son timont which now exists against tho crimo ot sotting on foot military expeditions within tho limits ol tho United States, to procood from thoncu and malc,o war upon tho pooplo of iinnllotiding istates with whom wo aro at peace, in tins respect n nappy cnangu uas liccn clloctud since tho commencement in my administration. It surely ought to bo tho piaycr ot every Christ.an and patriot that such expeditions may novur again roceivu con nton.iiioo In our country or depart from our shores. i,' It would bo usolosg repetition to do moro than refer, with earnest commendation, to my former recommendations in favor ot tho Pacific ltiiilioad oftho grant ol powor to tho President to employ tho naval force In thu vicinity for tho protection of tliu lives mil property (it our leUow-ciliens passing in transit over tho diU'orent Central American routes, against siiddonjmd lawless outbreaks and duprodatlonsj and also to piotuct Anior ic m merchant vossols and their crews nnd csrgous against violent and itnliiwfiil kuizuru and confiscation in tho ports nt Mexico and tho South Amoiicaii republics when theso may bo In a disturbed und -evolutionary condition. It is mv settled conviction that without such a power wo do tint nfiurd that piotectlon to thosu engaged in the commerce ol tho country which thoy have a right to demand. 

AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE, ETC. ELECTIONS OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. I again recommended to Congress tho pas sago of a law hi pursuance of tho provisions oftho Constitution, appointing a curtain day, previous to tho 4th of March, in each yuar ol an odd number, for tho eiection of Kcpro suiitatlvus thioughout all tho States. A simi lar powut liss already boun exorcised, with general appiubation, in tho apolntment ofthu aamu day throughout thu Union fur holding thu election for oloctors fur President and Vicu riuMilunt of thu United Status. My at tention was ii.iincstly dlruc.tud to this subject fioin thu fact that Iho 3-jth Cougiuss tei initi aled on tho 3d ol March. 1850, without mak ing tho nucessaiy appropriation I'or thu ser vice of tho Post Oilleu Ihip'iitniunt. I was thou forced to consider tlio best romudy fur tills omission, and an immediate call ofthu present Congress was thu natural rusort. Upon Inquiry, huwuver I nsci-i tallied that (lltucn out of thu tlility three States compos ing tho Confederacy wore without repioson tatlves, and that consequently, theso Alteon States would bo disfranchised hy such a call. Tltesu fiftuon States will bu 1,' tho somn con dition on tho 4th of Match next. Ten of th em cannot elect representatives, according to existing State laws, until different periods, extending fioin tho beginning of August next until the months of October und Novctnbir. In my last message I gave warning that in a timo of sudden nnd alarming danger, thu salvation of our Institutions may depend up on thu power ofthu President to asemblo a full QongtCjts, to meet theumcigeucy. 

TARIFF. It is now qtilto uvhlout that tho financial necessities oftho government will requlie a modification ot thu tarlir dining your present session, fur thop rpose of Increasing tliu rev. etiuo. In tills aspect I desire to rulterato tho iccommondiition contained In my lust two nnnmil inussigea, In favor of Imposing specif Ic. instead of advalorem duties on all import, ed articles to which those can bo properly applied. Krom long observation nnd exper ience I tun convinced that specifloduties aro necessary, lioth to protect tho revenue and to secure to our manufacturing iniorests that amount or Incidental itnuoiiragement which unavoidably insults from a revenue tarilf. As nu abstract proposition it may bu ad mitted that ndvalorcm dtttlus would in thoo. ry bo the most just and equal. Hut If tho ex perience of this and all other commercial na tions has demonstrated that such duties can not bu assessed nnd collected without great fraud upon thu revenue, that it Is tho part of wisdom to resort to specific duties. Indeed, from thu very nature of nn advaloram duty, this must bo tho result. Under it the Inevit able consoqucncd Is that foreign goods will bo sutured at leas than their true value, The treasury will therefcro, loso the duty on the dlllVrunco between iholr real and 'ficticious value, and to this oxtont wo aro dfrautled. Iho temptations which advalorom duties present to a dishonest Importer aro ir reslstaldu. His object Is to pass ,hls goods through tho Custom llouso at the "cry lowest valuation necessary to save them from con. flsciitlon. In this hu too often succeeds In i-pilu of tho vigilance of tho revenue ollleots. tho purchaser and another for tho Custom Ilenou the rusort to falso Invoices, one for House, ami to tho ether expedients to defraud tho government. Tho honest importer pro. duces his (uvolco to. tho collector, stilting tho nctual prlco nt which I us purchased tliu aiticlu u broad. Not so the dishouost liiiportor nnd tlio agent ol Ihu loroigu in mtu aoliirvr. And irvr. Aim huru it may be oborvetl that it very largo piopoitiou of tho manufacture huportud from abroad nr conlgood for aale to mission merchants who are moro agents em ployed by tho manufacturers. In uteh cases no actual sale has boon. mad o to fix their val- he. The foreign manufacturer. If he bo dishon est, prepares aii Involco of the gbods not at their nctual value( but at tho very lowest rate necessaty to escapo dutoctlon. In this manner tho dishonest Importer and tho foreign ninhnfacturor enjoy a decided advantago or er tho honest merchant. Thoy are thus en allied to undersell their fair trader, and drive him from the market. In fact, tho operation him from tho market, in .ystomhairo driven irom tho mirsiilts ofhnnorablo cotn'morcu many of that class of regular and conscientious merchants iviioso character, throughout tho world, Is thu tirldo of our country. The romody for theso evils is to bo found In spcalflo ilittlus, so far ns this may bo prac ticable.. Thoy dispense wllh any Inquiry at tho Custom llouso Into tho actual cost or valim of tho article nnd it pays tho precise amount of duty previously fixud bylaw. Thoy present no temptations to the appraisers of foreign goods, Mho receive, but small salar ies, and might by undervaluation In a fow cases, rendur thomsclvos Independent. Besides, specific dtttlus host conform to tho requisition in tho constitution that "no prof urenco shall ho given hy any regulation of commcrco or ravonuo to tho ports of onu Stato over thoso ornnother." Under our ad valorem syMcm such preferences are to some oxtont Inovltablo, npd complaints havo often been mado that tho spirit of this provision has bcon violated by a lower appraisement of tho samo articles at one. port man a; anoin cr. An Impression strangely enough provalls to somo extent that specific duties aro neces sarily protective duties. Nothing can bo moro fallacious. Great Britain glories in free trada, and yot her wholu rovonita Irom im ports is at tho present moment colluded un der ti system nl specific duties. It Is a strik ing fact in this connection, that, in the com mercial treaty ot 23(1 January, 1-C0, between France and rltigliind, onu of tho articles pro vidua that tlio udvalorem duties which It ! in ,oscs .shall bo fiinvet led into spoc'tfls duties within sin months from its date, nnd these are to bo usccitalncd liy making an avcr.ig" of tho micus for six months muvloits to that time. 'I'hu luvorsn of the proposition would bo nearer to Ilia trutli, uucauso a mucn larger amount of revonuo would bo collected by moiuly converting the advalorem duties of a tariff Into cmilvalcnt specific dntles. To this extent tho revenuo would bs Increase , and In tho samo proportion tho specific dut might bo diminished. Specific duties would secure to the American manufacturer the Incidental protection to which ho fairly entitled under a revenue tariff, and to this surely no person would object. The framers of the existing tariff liavo gone further, and in a lib eml spirit liavo discriminated in favor of large and useful branches of our manufactures, not by rais ing tho rate of duty upon the Impoitatlou of similar articles from abroad, butwhat is the same in effect by admitting articles free ol duty, which enter in to the composition of their fabrics. Under thu present system It has often been ro- maiked that this Incidental protection decreases w hen tho manufacturer needs it most, and increas es when he needs It least, nnd constitues a sliding which nlwaj s operates against him. The revenues ofthu country nro subject to similar fluctuation instead ol npproiicintig a steajy standard, as would be tho case under tho system of specific duties, they sink and ilsu with the sinking and ilsing pri ces theof articles in foreign countries. It would not be dilticiilt for Congress to arrange a system of specific duties wh ch would afford additional sta bility both to revenue and our manufactucs, nud wllliout Injury orlnjustico to nny interest of the country. This might be nccomplishcd by ascer taining tho average valno of any given article for nsciiesof years at the placo of exportation, and by pimply converting the rate of advalorem duty upon It which might be deemed necessary for rev enuu purposes, into tho form of a specific duty Such an nrrnngement could not Injure the consum er. If ho s'lould pay a greater am .unt orduty one year, this would bo counter-balanced by a lesser amount the next, nnd in tho end the aggregate would bo the same. I desiro to call jour immcdiato attention to the present condition of the Treasury, so ably and clearly presented by the Secretary in his icport to Congress, and to recommend that measures bo promptly adopted to enable It to discharge its pressing obligations. The other recommendations of tho report me well worthy of your favorable consideration. I herewith transmit to Congress Ihe reports of the Secretaries of War, of the Navy, of the Inte rior and tho i'ost.nnster General Tho recom mendations and suggestions which they contain are highly valuable and deserve your careful nt tciitinu. The report of tlio Postmaster General details the cireuuisl..iiices under which Cornelius Vanderbilt, - limy request, ngiucd in Ihe mouth ol July last, to ci ivy tho ocean mills between tho Atlantic ami nud Pacific coasts. Mad he not thus acted, this important Intercommunication must have been sus pended for a season. The I'ostm istcr General had no power to make him any other compensa tion than tho postage on tho niail matter ho might carry, it was known at tho timo that those post ages would fall I'arshortof nn adequate compensa tion, as well ii3 oftho Eum which tho samo service had previously cost the government. Mr. Van deibitt, w ith a conimcndnblo spirit, was willing to rely upon the-Justico of Congress to miko up the deficiency; nud I the re fore recommend that nn ap propiiatiou bo granted for this purpose I should do great injustice to tho Attorney Gen. cinl were 1 to omit the mention of his distinguish ed ccrvico3 in tho measures adopted nud prosecuted by him for I he defense oftho government against the numerous and un founded claims to land in California, purporting to have been made by tfie Mexican Povornuicnt previous to the treaty of cess-ion. Tho successful opposition to theso claims h is s.ued to Iho United States, public property w ut til miiiv millions uf dollars, and to individiia's holding titles to them to nt least an equal amount. It has lo en icpie-eiited to mo, from sources wh eh I I'eeni reliable, that thu inh ibitants In sev eral portions of Kain is Ii .vu been reduced nearly tu a stile of starvation, "on account of the nhno3t total failure of th ir imps, whilst the liu vcfls in every oilier portion of the couutry havo bcon abundant.

Tho destitution ap pears to bo so general that it cannot bo relieved by piivate contribution, nnd they nro in'such indi gent circumstances ns to bo unablo tn purchase the necessaries of life for themselves. I refer the subject to Congress. If nny consitutlonal measure for their relief can bo devised, 1 would recommend its adoption.
