An Earnest Dofenso of the Nineteenth Cen tury Club Member Not Hound b tho , Opinions Expressed by Speakers A I.lat of Subjects of DUcnlon to HhoiT that tbo Association Is Not Frivolous. Mr, CourtlanJt P.ilnier wis found this morning; by a Would reporter at hla residence, No. 117 East Twenty-nut street. lie was sitting In the front room of the sntt In which the Nineteenth Century Clun has bo often discussed leading questions of the day. " What do yon think of Judge. Barrett's resigna tion from tho club ?" the reporter asked. " I think Judge llarrctt's courso Is cowardly I Yes," Mr. Palmer continued after a moment's reflection, "cowardly. Ho was no more com mined to my views than ho was to thoso of any I member of tho club. "My views aro my own; they do not represent, necessarily, tho mind of tho club on tho point In question any more than any other member's do. "Hitherto I have always regarded Judzc Dar ren s a sincere, ftatliBa inan. If tho sentiment attributed to him be true, why, Judgo Barrett Is mistaken. " i he Supreme Court of the United States simply decided in r gard to the Anarchists' case that the decision of the Supremo Court of Illinois did not fall under its Jttr s notion. This judgment of the Supremo Court did not say anything as to tho merlin of the case or the Justleo of tho verdict. " I think a man In my position, slnco I am re girded a associated with the capitalistic body, in regard to t no An rchUts, Is honiBt and entitled to respect. I lullevc they were executed far more bee iufc titer wero Anarchists than becauso they were murderers. , "I consider tnem as laboring for n pood end tho abolition of poverty and that from their standpoint they were hon st thinkers. I do not comm-nd their means nor Indorse tnelr standpoint, but I do believe they Were martyrs 1 1 their principles, and If the su preme court of Illinois nad possessed the courage of the Court of Appe Is It woHd bavo acted In the Anarchists' case as the latter did In Sharp's. ' I am somewhat lrrlta'ed, I confess, by this stand of Judvc llarrett's, and think It rather mean. How Is he commuted to my views any more thin Mr. Naoh Davis is, who Is a member of the club? The motto of the club Is, Test all things. Hold fast what I true." "Judge Barrett's remark that the club had taken of late to discussing things for amusement more than for earnest Inquiry Is sufficiently refuted by the subjects which the club has taken up of late. They rtgard live and Important questions. " Tho next dlscu-slnn concerns literary proprie torship. Very soou David Welles will ulscuss the auestion of protection ami free trade. Another iscusslon will be on establishing a school for dra matic art. "Col. Ineersoll will soon cross swords with some prominent dlvln, If any will meet him, on the subject of religion. That doesn't look llko frivolity," added Mr. Palmer. "Will the tealgna ton of Mr. Carnegie and Jndgo Barrett affect tho nitib at all;" ' No. The majority of the clnb will not be nf fece I at all. Mr. Carnegie's remarks were some what uncourteous, since I was uebarred, by my position, from taking any stand against them.'1 RED TOP UNDER A SNOW BLANKET. The President's Country l'lnco Being Made Itendy for tho Holidays. srrciAL to Tmc world. Washington, Dec. 18. The snow that foil yester day has blown and drifted In the country roads about Washington, rendering them well-nigh Im passable. This afternoon The Would correspond ent drovo In a light cutter out over tho glistening snow to tako a look at -Bed Top, the President's country place, which for tho first time this season wore its winter dress of dazzling white. The air was as sharp as Jack Frost can make it in this lati tude, but tho snn shown brightly and the bills and valleys aloug the picturesque Wocdley lane, road echoed the merry jingle of sleigh belli. After twenty minutes rapid driving a sharp tarn In tho road suddenly disclosed a full view of tbo ctiarmlug vllia where tho Presi dent and Mrs. Cleveland nave spent the happiest hours of their weddid life. But It was "Hed Top" no longer, lbu red tiles and shingles which cap the cupolas, gable roofs and verauuas, and which were heretofore the first objects tnat broke upon the view as the wavf rer climbed the hill, were lust to sight under the heavy mantle of snow that sparkled like diamond dUBt In the rays or the setting sun. Driveway and paths were blotted out completely, and great drifts of snow Isy under the port-cochere. The course of the main drive could be followe I, however, by the long line of rose-bushes that uorder It, which are the President's particular pride and care. Oiten In the early summer, wnen he csn steal an hour or two from weightier responsibilities, he dons an old wide-brimmed straw hat and, clad In a linen dus ter that has done duty for Mayor, Governor and president, potters among his roses, loosening the toll at their roots and pruning their twigs With a bone-handled pocket knife, yellow with age, that Was old when the duster was new. To-day the roses wore winter coverings of straw nd little white caps of snow set Jauntily on one side. Though tho big gate stood hospitably open, the driveway showed neither wheel track nor foot- frint, except where an Inquisitive dog had made an ncunlon naif way to the house and there, fright ened at bis own temerity, bad scurried back again. Tho boughs of t he big tree, which the President gavo Mrs. Cleveland for her very own, and under watch the fair mistress of Oakvtew delights to sit busied with some light task on pleasant summer days, bung heavily laden with bqow. Even tho wire fences and the telephone line that connects Mrs. Cleveland's boudoir at the White House with the pretty villa loosed like glistening wnlte ribbons strung from post to post, life big windmill baek of the cottage creaked and groaned on Its perch In the air, and now aud then, meetlug a sudden gust I of wind, sent the snow flying from its whirling I arms. At the houso curtains were drawn and 1 blinds clo.ed. A tnln column of smoke, however, curling from the chimney proclaimed the fact that at least a servant hud been left in charge. Ills Sxpccted that Bed Top will be put In gala attire urlng the coming week, as botti the President and Mrs. Cleveland spend much time there during the Christmas holidays. Air.

(SPECIAL TO Till WORLD.l Washington, Dec 18. It is remarkaldo how the hand of tho great James U. Blame W felt In the halls of Conue.s. Although absent he Is present at all times In the minds of the Itepubllcans. Many Congressmen who are willing to discuss frcelr all matters of legislation and will give their vlows on tho tariff become Instantly silent when Ho nsrao of the Maine statesman Is meutloned. Thero are a fow strong Blaine men llko Senator Kuione II lie and Congressman William Walter Phelps, who are always glad to put themselves on record as staunch supporters and are watching after Ms Interests. But the foremost men In the ltepul.lloan ranks In both House and Senate have nono of this loyalty. Tho majority of the delegation from Maine have very llltlo to say for Blaine, and when they are cornered on the question they talk very guardedly. Tom Beed, of Maine, tho acknowledged leader of tho Kepubllcan host! In the llouso, was onco an avowed enemy of Blaine and Fryo would bo pleased to Bee some other man head tho Kepubllcan ticket next year. Blnlno has fow friends among tho leaders In the Senate. John 6herman watoncs every move with cat-like anxiety and senator Ed munds Jealously guards his views, taking care never to mintlon tho Maine statesman's name. Senator Hawley, who ts Mippoed to be afflicted with a beo In his bonnet. Is guarded as to whst ho sayB and carefully avoids any reference to him. Senator Allison, although not one of the Blaine watchers, Is possessed of a strong and growing backing, and whllo he has nothing to Bay against Blaine be believes that any one, ot half a dozen men will poll Just as many votes lu 1888. It Is pretty well known that a great many of the Itepubllcans in the Fiftieth Congress do not person ally favor Mr. Blaluc Many of them wcro strong Blaine men In years gono by, but they havo lost their loyalty. They think that ho has been given moro han a fair chance, and that It Is time now to try some other man. Some of tnem had doubts about whether ho would fight out anothor cam paign, but his promptness In running to the trout with his Interview on the President's message has demonstrated that Blaine has by no means abandoned tho field. The fact that " Joe " Manlsy waB on hand to engineer the convention to Chicago, and that his trusted lieutenants are now booming him In New York, tints an end to all doubiB. If too Maine statesman is to head the national ticket In the next campai ti the members of Congre-s will have to take oif their coau and go Into the llghL For this reaBon tney are extremely cautious about puttliw themselves on record, however much they are opposed to nlm. There Is little spontaneous euinuslasni tor Illalno lo be found In cither house, but no member cares to antagonize the absent sta esman until It Is seen h'iw largely he will flgnro at the National Conven tion. Just at present the Itepubllcans In and ont ot the House are making every postble effort to Induce Hnonknr Carlisle in anuoint William Walter Fnelps to a position on the Wavs and Means Committee. This, It la said, la being done In the lutereat of Blaine, who wants a good friend on this cry Im portant committee. A well-known Republican Con ressman who does not favor Mr. Blaine said to The Would corrc.pondeut to-day: "Ore it pres sure nas been brought to bear upon Mr. Carlisle 'o secure this place for Mr. Phelps, bnt li Is douut nl whether ho will get it. In the first place, Mr. Pnelps Is lrom New Jersey. From ItBdelegat on lu the House Mr. larllslewdl encounter some of the most violent opposition he Is apt to meet with in the Impending struggle over the tariff. '1 he Ways and Means Committee will originate the Tariff bid, and Mr. Carlisle Is likely to think tnat tne Unlit made against him by Itepubllcans and protection Demo crats on the floor of the House will be bitter enough without putting any more high-tariff men on the commlttio than he is obliged to." 

CHINESE OPIUM REFINERIES. i Product of Ten Factories In the Northwest Smuggled Into This Country. SPECIAL TO THX WORLD.l Ottawa, OnU, Dec ia Mr. Wolff, the special customs agent of the Dominion, arrived here last night on very Irai on.int bus nets with tho Oovern inent regarding alleged falsification ot Invoices on which goods are being Imported Into Canada from the United States. In couversatlon with a Would correspondent Mr. Wolff said that a short tlmo slnco he visited British Columbia to ascertain the amount oj smuggling going on In that proviuce, tho guilty parties and modus operandi. In the course of his lnvest'gatlons he had learned that enormous quantities of opium are being smuggled Into the United states from points In that and other provinces In the Dominion. He got into the conn dence of several Chlnsmcn purposely to report to the American authorities how business was being carried on. This Information he has communicated to cus toms oflKlals on the other sldo ot the line. Ho says the revenue of tho United States Is being de frauded to sn almost incredible extent In the item of opium alone. He loarned tnat from British, Columbia large quantities ot manufactured opium are being Bent oast over the Canadian Pacific, wnlch finds its way Into tne United States at vari ous points along tho Si. Lawrence Blver, notably at Brockvllle. There are now eleven factories refining crude opium in Victoria, any one of which Is sufficient to supply the local demand of the Chinese In lhat province. Tne production of the other ten, as a matter of course, finds Us way Into the United States. The process- of manufac turing or refining Is Inexpensive, and adds Utile to tne original cost of the crndo article, hence the enormous profit In marketing It across the Hue without payment of duty. , In British Columbia u larpe business Is done In smuggling the articles from Cadboro Bay to San Jnan Island, where It is held nntll placed on board sloops or small steamers and taken to Seattle, Townsend or Tacoma, Con-lderable quantities are also shipped to Sau Francisco lu lumber-laueu ves sels from Victoria. Detroit Is also a receiving point from this side of the line. A Scheme to Explore Hnbylon. Philadelphia, Dec 18.
