Frank Ransom's partner will not bo city attorney for awhile yet. The Omaha Evening Bee Is the newspaper - paper of largest circulation In Douglas county. Under modern medical science even smallpox has .become a comparatively harmless contagion. The B.CQ does not have to give Its ad vertising away. Advertising worth hav ing Is worth paying a fair price for. Charter revision committees are al ready In active operation In Lincoln , South Omaha and other Nebraska cities. Now let the Omaha committee get to work. A business i legislature conducted on business methods , giving the people leg islation in the Interest of economy , Is the demand of the people irrespective of political party. With a new trial ordered , in the Oerter gambling case the efforts of the gam blers' gang to have the attorney who defended Oerter appointed to prosecute him will be redoubled. The ice harvest has commenced , but the harvest of the Ice companies Is de ferred until next summer , when people will probably bo compelled as usual to pay prices prevailing in the tropics. The decision of the supreme court In the Bartlcy bond case is hardlycalcu , lated to give encouragement to State Treasurer Meserve In his quest of sure ties on his new official bond. If congress does not expedite the army reorganization bill It will not bo for lack of pressure from the friends of volun teers whose mustering out must await the enlargement of the regular army. Hostilities will now be resumed be tween the state of Nebraska and the Hartley bondsmen. There is still room for hope that a portion of the vacuum In the state treasury may bo refilled. The Bartley bond case will go to a trial shortly and the sheriff will be given another chauco to impress a few moro intelligent jurymen into the serv ice who never even heard of such a man as Bartley. The local popocratlc organ finds It hard to determine over which it shall shod the roost tears the extinction of the Broatch claim to the mayoralty or the nufflnc out of the Hcrdman gang of outlaw police commissioners. Applicants for liquor licenses or drug gists' permits will toke notice that by the decision of the supreme court of Ne braska The Omaha Evening Bco is the newspaper of largest circulation by law entitled to the publication of all license notices. The War Investigating commission Is attempting to llnd out why the Spanish prisoners of war were sent home at the expense of thltj government. That Is an easy one. It was cheaper to send them homo than to feed them , especially In view of. the appetites cultivated by long continued short rations. Tbo announcement from Lincoln that the populist state committee had settled up the financial affairs of the late cam paign with still a balance In the treas ury will be ad news to the hungry popocrats who see no chance of securing a dividend until another campaign. A campaign surplus Is a sure sign of cam paign mismanagement The report comes from Chicago that all hard and fast agreements regarding freight and passenger trafllc having been declared Illegal , the railroad man agers will adopt another plan to etop the mutual throat-cutting. Each Hue is to nmko its own tariff ehect , so thu fact that thu rates from all competitive points are the sumo on all roads will bo only a coincidence. In the railway ver nacular this will be no pool , no traffic association , but simply "an agree ment , " and when It Is all done the pub lic pays the freight A HIUIITBUUS Nebraska taxpayers will hall with satisfaction the righteous order of tlio supreme court for a now trial In ilia Hartley bond cane1. At the time the ver dict was broughtIn last February , wip ing out all liability of the sureties on the bond , The Bi'o denounced It as an unmltlgatqd outrage in the following emphatic language : The verdict rendered by the jury In the suit brought by the state to recover on the bond at Joseph S. Hartley the amount em bezzled by him during his second term as state treasurer li an unmitigated outrage upon the people of Nebraska as well as a travesty upon law and justice. The make-up ( of this jury made It practically certain from the start that the state could not secure a verdict at Its hands whatever the proofa might be. Out nobody , not even the attorneys of the defending bondsmen , believed that these twelve men couM be persuaded to bring In a finding relieving Bartley and his sureties from all responsibility. The evidence presented In the bond suit was the eamo as that upon which Bartley had been convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to a twenty-year term In the peni tentiary. The charge of the judge positively Instructed the jury that the bond was valid and that the bondsmen must be held re- sponslbfo for whatever shortage was proved to have originated during the.t.wo yca.rg for which Ita given. While there might have been an honest difference of opinion as to the amount embezzled by Bartley during his second trrn , no honest man who heard and undercut he charge could render a ver dict thai ould nullify the bond and release the suretu. . from every dollar of obligation. The proa that a verdict In favor of the state was demanded a * a vindication of Gov ernor Holcomb's action In approving the bond Is very Ingenious , but It Is not for a jury to rob the taxpayers In order to cen sure the governor. The governor's reckon ing must be with the people at the ballot box or with the legislature when It cornea to review his acts. A censure that costs the taxpaylng public of Nebraska from $400,000 to $600,000 Is rather en expensive way of expressing displeasure. In bringing In such an outrageous verdict In defiance of the Instructions of the court the jury throws upon Douglas county the burden of another costly re-trial which the supreme court win undoubtedly order. It la bad enough that this county has been obliged to stand the enormous expense of Dartley'a criminal prosecution with the In cidental coat of boarding him for en Indefi nite time. To Impose upon the county -the further burden of & third trial of the bond suit Is 'utterly without justification. The case against the Bartley bonds men will have to be tried again and it is hoped with better success for the state. The legislature , however , should reim burse Douglas county for the tremendous deus expense it has been put to in the prosecution of Bartley and his bonds men because this expense properly be longs to- the people of the whole state. OBJECT LESSON FOlt FREE TRADERS. An English paper remarks that the American export figures are so prodig ious as to confound free traders and thu time has arrived for England to con sider her whole economic position. While the exports of the United States have been rapidly increasing , at no time more so than since the present tariff act went Into effect , the export trade of England has declined. A short time ago the president of the Brit ish Board of Trade said he regretted to have to confess that the exports for the year which ended with October had decreased $13,000,000 , "chiefly through the alteration of the United States tar iff " further that " , observing "although wo ought not tO'be surprised that we are being so rapidly overhauled in exports by other nations , especially by the United States and Germany , It is a re grettable fact that while since 1801 the exports of the United States have in creased 18 per cent , Great Britain's ex ports have decreased 5 per cent. " But such facts have no weight with the American free traders , who go on in sisting that our tariff policy Is a hin drance to our export trade. It should be understood that British reference to our exports relates entirely to manufactured products. It is the in crease in this direction that Is signifi cant. This it is that completely upsets the free trade contention that our pro tective policy kept us out of the world's markets and that we could never expect Industrial supremacy until we aban doned that policy and adopted the Brit ish economic system. The facts are most conclusive against free trade doctrine , yet It continues to have adherents and advocates , though evidence is not lackIng - Ing that their number is decreasing. 

CARELESS PEA'SION LEGISLATION. At the last session of congress Sen ator Galllnger , chairman of the senate pension committee , referred , dcprccat- ingly to the carelessness and haste of pension legislation. He said that of the many private pension bills Introduced at every session very few received the con sideration that should bo given such measures , but they were rushed through regardless of their merits. The New Hampshire senator Is a sincere friend of the pension system , but he had seen so much abuse of It In this way that he felt it to be bte duty , as it unques tionably was , to call attention to the matter and to urge that more considera tion bo given to these bills. Senator Vest of Missouri has an nounced that he proposes to have a stop put to this sort of loose pension legisla tion. Ho declared in the senate on Thursday that "this thing of passing a lot of pension bills simply by the reading of the ttltlcs and when a quorum of the senate is not present has got to be stopped. " The chairman of the pension committee agreed with him and so will the people. Everybody desires that those who have a just claim upon the beneficence of the government shall re ceive it , but it Is the duty of the representatives of the people to know that the claims for pension presented to them are just and meritori ous and it is a gross Injustice to thu people ple to allow sucu claims without having given them adequate investigation. The statement of Mr. Vest that pension bills are passed in the senate simply by the reading of their titles and when a quo rum of the scnato Is not present Is a serious reflection upon that body. Doubt less the house of representatives Is guilty of the sumo looseness. .Such careless voting away of the public money cannot bo too strongly condemned and with the pension account steadily growing It is time to put an end to hasty and reckless pension legislation. There Is no demand on thu government which calls for closer scrutiny than that of pounlon and there Is none that \ \ given lea * . A change In this particular will meet with universal approval and thcro can bo no doubt would effect a considerable saving to the national treas ury. AX OUST/Icorm ; 

TKKATV. A resolution has been Introduced In the United States senate declaring It to be the sense of that body that the presi dent enter into negotiations with the government of Oicut Britain for the purpose of abrogating or modifying the Olnyton-Hulwer treaty "DO far and to the extent that the MI inn may be deemed to prevent the United States from owning , constructing , controlling or operating an Intcroeeanlc canal ncrons the isthmus of Darleu. " This treaty , negotiated forty-eight years ago , Is held by some to Interpose an absolute barrier to the acquisition of military control of the Nicaragua canal by the United States. It provides that neither Great Britain nor the United States shall In peace or hi war ever ac quire "any exclusive control over the said ship canal , " that "neither will erect or maintain any fortifications command ing the same" and that the two govern ments will guarantee the neutrality of the canal and Invite other nations to enter Into similar agreements with them. It has been urged by some of our statesmen that the treaty has In effect been abrogated by reason of the violation of some of Its terms by the British government , but others hold that It is still in force and it Is needless to say that this Is the British view. He- ferrlng to what President McKInley said In his message favoring the con struction of a translsthmlau canal the London Times said : "If the freedom of the waterway Is secured to the ships of all nations , as In the Suez canal , we shall not need to stand strictly on claims which originated when circumstances were altogether different. " Other Brit ish papers have clearly indicated that they regard the Clayton-Bulwer treaty as being in full force and also that the United States will be expected to com ply with all lt conditions and re quirements , should the government construct and control the Nicaragua canal. But as auggcsted in the remarks of the London Times , Great Britain might not insist upon claims made under altogether different circumstances If the canal should be neutralized , that Is , If it should remain open to the ships of all nations , whether In time of war or In peace. Otherwise It is not doubted that Great Britain would protest and very likely with the support of ttie other maritime powers. The advocates of government control of the Nicaragua canal do not want It neutralized. In peace it would of course be open to the ships of all nations , but they desire that It shall be In the power of the government to declare It closed to the ships of any other nation In time of war. In other words , they want the United States to have the exclusive military advantage of the canal. The treaty stands in the 'way of this. As suming that the senate resolution will be adopted , the question Is will the British government agree to abrogate the treaty or to make such modification of It aswill permit the United States to have exclusive control of the Nicaragua canal without any guar antee In regard to Its neutralization In peace and war ? It is very doubtful , for obviously such a concession might place Great Britain in a very awkward position , since it would certainly en counter the vigorous protest of other maritime powers. There could not be a more auspicious time , however , for en tering upon negotiations with a view to the abrogation or modification of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. That compact has for years been a source of more or less Irritating controversy between the two governments and it is clearly In the Interest of friendly relations that this cause of. difference and dispute , growing out of conflicting interpreta tions , be removed. The proposed nego tiation should be authorized and entered Into as soon as possible. THE 

PAPER OF LARGEST CIRCULATION. The decision just rendered by the su preme court interpreting the law relat ing to the publication of liquor license notices In the newspaper of largest cir culation In the county in which the ap plication Is made is a complete victory for The Bee on the points at issue. It establishes , as far as the court could dose so , the right of The Omaha Evening Bee to all advertising by law required to be published In the paper of largest circulation in this county. This decision should furthermore ef fectually put at rest the absurd pre tense made by the publishers of the Morning World-Herald and the Evening World-Herald that for purposes of legal advertising those two papers constitute one paper under the fictitious name of the Dally World-Herald , whose circula tions can be combined for comparison with the circulation of The Omaha Even ing Bee. The supreme court substan tially declares that there Is no such newspaper as the so-called Dally World- Herald and the decision has the unani mous concurrence of all the judges. So many misleading statements have been made with reference to the con tests for liquor license publication that it is not impertinent to inform the pub lic correctly upon several points. From the enactment of the present license law In 1881 The Omaha Evening Bee has been continuously the paper of largest circulation in Douglas county and thereby entitled to this advertising. No applicant who advertised bid notice In The Omaha Evening Bee has ever been refused a license on the ground of de fective publication. In nil pretended comparisons of circulation before police boards thu publishers of the Morning and Evening World-Heralds have com bined the circulations of these two pa pers against that of The Omaha Even- lug Bee , yet In every instance The Omaha Evening Bee has shown a cir culation to bona fide paid subscribers in this county In excess of the com bined circulations of those two papers , in most Instances In excess by several thousand. These facts should be of Interest not only'to the general newspaper reader , but also to the newspaper advertiser , who here has tangible proof of thu mi- pcrlor circulation of The Bco over all compoHtom. The planting of jovery new gun In the batteries Intended for the defense of the harbors of the United States wirves as a basis for a war-scare article In the newspapers War deportment officials affirm that nothing In this Hue is being done except to put In place the guns on hand and being built. The fortlllca- tloim were planned years ago and the construction 1ms gone steadily forward fin fast as appropriations would admit and will be continued In the future until a fiy.stem of fortifications which will umku the coast line cafe from at tack is completed. The mounting of more gnus , therefore , Is no sign that trouble of any kind Is anticipated. On the contrary , to remain In a defense less condition would be to Invite trouble with any naval power which might think it had a grievance against the United States. How gratifying that when the SpanIsh - Ish leave Cuba It will be Impossible to carry tile island itself away with them. Having- neglected no opportunity to take everything movable , they seem still to be looking for more. It has been cus tomary for certain officials of whom a bon'd was required to put up cash with the understanding that the money would be returned to them , but It now develops that the higher Spanish offi cials have either spent or appropriated this trust money. Unless the officials who must stand this loss differ ma terially from their superiors they have long ago made up for this misfortune by appropriation of public funds on their own account. Three regiments of regulars destined for the Philippines arc to be sent from New York by way of the Suez canal. Enrouto they will make several stops at European ports , and the people of those countries will have nn opportunity to gee what manner of man It was that confounded European military critics. If they look for gold lace and gay trap pings they will be disappointed , but In a mlxup they will find the bluecoat a pretty shifty fellow. Congress Is not doing just the right thing by the noted members of the Canadian commission , who have several times been present as guests at Its ses sions. They would have enjoyed a spe cial performance showing Speaker Reed presiding and Bailey of Texas In a state of active eruption. The constitution of Nebraska requires the annual reports of state officers to be In the hands ol the governor ten days before the opening of the legislative sesslpn. It remains to be seen whether this provision will afford opportunity for another exhibition of sham reform. A Connotation Purse , Philadelphia Times.

Friendly Interest In Weyler. Philadelphia Ledger. Naturally we Americans take more Inter est In Spanish politics now than we ever did before , and we follow General Weyler's fortunes with peculiar attention because we feel so well acquainted with him. Just now It looks as If the former tyrant of Cuba was about to become the political boas ot Spain. A Trace to Wnr. Globe-Democrat. France Is giving one strong guaranty that the peace of Europe , eo far as she can Influ ence peace , will not be broken for two years at feast. She gives this assurance through her International exposition of 1900. A world's fair is something more to France than It Is to any other country. It Is a mat ter of national sentiment and patriotic pride to every Inhabitant of France , while In the pther countrlca which have them such affairs are chiefly regarded as business enterprises , which are got up to make money for their promoters and to advertise their country's resources and capabilities. Plain Tulle In Bent. Chicago News. Sir Edmund J. Monson , England's am bassador to France , thinks the press , the In novations ot the mother country , and the originality of the American mind "ever restleealy watching to Improve everything" will , perhaps , "end by whipping the diplo matists of the old school oft the earth. " It Ambassador Monson refers to diplomatists of the kind that delight In "European concert * " in aid ol barbarism and the repression of people striving for freedom from oppres sion , It Is to be hoped his prediction will be fulfilled. That would be a "consumma tion devoutly to be wished. " The soonsr they get off the earth the better for the cause of humanity , liberty and progress. Itch ( or OtHce Holding. Rocky Mountain News. Offlceholdlng has become a mania. The official Itch has become a disease which permeates all'classes from the smoky at mosphere of a justice of the peace's court and the dingy room of the police sergeant , to the elegant appointments of the state executive and the dignified precincts ot the white house. Once the mania Is fastened on a man It clings to him for life. Two or four years In public office unfits a man for ordinary business , and he drifts Into politics , there to stay , In the effort to gain a pre carious living off the public. Every city , every state capital and the national capital are full of men whose lives have been wrecked by office-holding and politics. It Is not a healtfu ! sign. It Indicates a weak ness that Is not creditable to American man hood. It has been fostered by the spoils system , which Is one of the unexpected I growths on our system of government. TUB 

I'HKSIDKNT'S MESBAUG3. Chicago News ( Ind. ) : On the whole , the message Is a calm , conservative , business- Ilka review of the condition and needs ot < hu country , entirely frco from boasttulnots and Indicating the "safe" qualities the president has conspicuously displayed , It Is the measured statement of one who has made history as well as of one who can In telligently review It. Philadelphia Ledger ( rrp.i ) The reticence of the president's message as to the future status of the posiwslons coming to us un der the Paris treaty will be generally ac cepted by the American public as prudent and sagacious. This reserve ot the execu tive respecting the disposition of our pros pective Island ncqutsltl&ns and the relation In which they shall stand to the union Is entirely proper at this time , and In taking this course the president has observed the limitations of executive functions. Indianapolis Journal ( rep. ) : The whole message bears upon Its face the purpose ot the president to lay before congress and the country the general acts of the administra tion , the condition ot public affairs nnd our relations with other nations. What recom mendations ho has made will not arouse partisan hostility or create dissensions In his own party. If the country does not nnd new policies set forth , It will find that President McKtnley IB the head of an administration and Is familiar with all affairs ot the gov ernment. . . . Philadelphia Tlmes , ( dcjm.l : The president ventures upon no suggestions concerning the revenue , though the estimate of a deficiency of $112,000,000 in the current fiscal year would Indicate that the subject Is not unim portant. This Is perhaps the most Con spicuous omission In a message that Is , In general , a comprehensive report ot a success ful year , and a statement of the require ments growing out of new conditions. He has apparently confined his ImmeJIate recom mendations to such as ho may reasonably hope to have acted upon nt once. Brooklyn Eagle ( dem. ) : In the very re spects In which Mr. McKInley Is sometimes critically called a halting , cautious or 1m- posltlve president , he has shown himself In the past the mauler of clement and concil iatory statesmanship , needful to the unity and efficiency of the republic In great crises , and we think he will show himself , and wisely , that kind of a president always. As , however , he has never failed to act with pre cision and wUdom , when action has been called for , so win he fall neither to denote nor to take effective action when It shall again bo called for , as often It will be , in the days that are at the door. N w York Times ( dem. ) : In declining to "discuss at this time the government or the future of the new possessions which will come to us aa the result of the war with Spain , " President McKInley renounces that leadership of public opinion which our great presidents have cherished as the noblest ot their privileges. "Such discussions , " Bays the president , "will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified. " No. That will be too late. They are appropri ate now , lu order that the people may form and express their opinions before the senate takes up the consideration of the tieaty. Detroit Journal ( rep. ) : The recommenda tion of the president that the standing army bo Increased to 100,000 men docs not , It ap pears from the message , mean necessarily a permanent Increase to that number. But as the Philippines , Porto Rico and Cuba will each require garrison * of soldiers , and as It Is'the Intention to discharge the volunteers at the earliest moment that they can be replaced by regulars , It Is possible that for a year or two the full number of 100,000 will be under arms. When tran- qutllty Is restored to Cuba and the Philip pines the site of the army may be again re duced to proportions more in keeping with the peace policy of this nation. 

POLITICAL DRIFT. Mr. Simon , the new senator from Oregon , Is the smallest man In congress smaller i than General Wheeler and Senator Wilson , who weighs onlyi 98 pounds. If , .  Olive/ Hazard Perry Belmon't succeedjfex- Governor Flower as president of the Demo- cratlc club of New York , the organization supported by Tammany. Belmont , like Flower , Is an anti-free sliver man. The efforts of the yellow democratic clique to oust Joe Bailey from the leadership In congrcs are not prospering. Speaker Reed recognized the Texas statesman as the demo cratic leader , and the speaker know * a leader when he eeei one. William M. Bunn , one of th men men tioned for the republican nomination for mayor of Philadelphia , Is a westerner ot much experience. He waa territorial gov ernor of Idaho under President Arthur , and led a lively fight against Mormonlsm In that section. Charles J. Dumar , former president of Typographical union No. 6 , New York City , Is a candidate for appointment by Governor Roosevelt as commissioner of labor statis tics. Mr. Dumar , who was one of the origi nal Roosevelt men , Is endorsed for the posi tion by practically all the trade organiza tions and labor unions of the state. He is also vouched for by Seth Low , Samuel J. Compere and many leading republicans and independents. Only two large states in the country will have democratic governors after January 1. These are Mlesourl and Texas. Texas chose a governor at the recent election ; Missouri didn't. All tba most Important states have , or will h&vo after January 1 , republican governors New York , Pennsyl vania , Ohio , Illinois ; Massachusetts , New Jersey , Indiana , Michigan , California , Ken tucky and Wisconsin. Governors were elected In twenty-one of the forty-five states this year , and there will be elections for gov rnor In only a few states next year , notably Ohio , which the republicans carried overwhelmingly at the late election ; Iowa , which Is again se curely In the republican column ; Ken tucky , which Is again democratic ; Mary land , which has a republican governor , but Is doubtful between the parties ; Missis sippi , In which suffrage Is more restricted than In any other state , and Rhode Island , which still adhere to annual elections for governor. With the exception of Mary land , none of these states can b regarded as close. The hottest local fight of a generation Is on In Chicago. The street railways are Im portuning the city council for a fifty-year franchise In accordance with the notorious Allen law , which created such a scandal In the last legislature. The first and the best of existing franchises expires In 1903. An ordi nance providing for the fifty-year extension Is now before the council. A majority of the members favor the extension on the terms proposed by the companies 3 per cent of the grow receipts be paid into the city treasury , but without reducing the C-cent fare. Mayor Harrison announces bis opposi tion to the measure and will veto It. The problem before the corporations Is to secure enough votes to override a veto. At the last count they were thirteen votes short. Mean while the warmet kind of Indignation meet- Ings are being held throughout the city to denounce extension.

OT1IRH I.ANIHI THAN OURS. > ) Dr. von Mlquer'a expulsion policy tor It is attributed to him seem * to bo causing a good deal of trouble between Prussia and her neighbors , It began with the expulsion of a hundred or more Danes from Schlcswlg. That was particularly exasperating to the Danes , because Schleswlg was formerly a Ianl h province and was forcibly wrested from Denmark by Pruesta In 1804 , where fore expelling the Danes from It seems to them llko expulsion from their own right- fur home. But the Prussian government did not stop there. It went on to expel a num ber of Dutch folk from Westphalia. Then It drove from Brrslau some Pofish Jews who had ventured across the border. And flnatty it expelled , also from Brcslau , n number of Austrian Sla\s , from Bohemia , Denmark and Hottand had not ventured of ficially to remonstrate , though their news paper press raged against King William's government not against him personally , since he was then on his pilgrimage to the Holy Land. But Austria has not been so cotnptacint. Her prime minister Is the great Bohemian Slav nobleman , Count von Thun , ' and ho spoke and acted with decision. Ho prevailed upon the Imperlar foreign min ister , Count Ooluchowskl , a Slleslan Pole , ' to make strong protest and he assured the Relchsrath that Austrlans In Prussia would be protected or , If necessary , retaliatory measures would be adopted. That , of course , made trouble. Down to that moment many Important Prussian Journals had disapproved i or questioned the wisdom ot Dr. von Mlqucl'9 policy , But these utterances at , Vienna turned them Instantry to hot support of the government. Bo at present they are showing their teeth and growling all manner of dire menaces at Prussia's or Germany's ally In the triple alliance and even sug gested that Prussia Is entirely ready to see that alliance dissolved. A letter from St. Petersburg to the Ham burger Correspondent glvea some Interest ing detail of the activity and energy dis played by the Russians at Port Arthur. The writer says that the work ot deepening { I and enlarging the harbor goes on day and night and before long there will be water for the largest Ironclad. In the town masons , carpenters and all sor's of artisans are busy. Storehouses , arsenals , government buildings spring up In a night and the place Is rapidly araumlug a clvlflzed appearance. Private enterprise keeps pace with official activity. The number of commercial houses which establish branch offices there is dally Increasing. Contrary to Its custom , the Russian government is doing everything to promote the development of the place. Pos tal affalra are zealously regulated and pri vate steamers and men-of-war keep up regu lar Intercourse with Chefoo and Nagasaki. From the Russian poitofflce at Cbefoo dairy communication by land with Irkutsk , via Tientsin , has been 'organised , so that from Port Arthur the most distant spot In Euro pean Russia can be reached in about four weeks , while only a short time ago months were necereary. Telegraphic communica tion , which is still by way ot Vladlvostock , leaves much to be desired , but the govern ment is devoting serious attention to this point. It la positively stated that the gov ernment intends soon to begin building ex tensive docks , etc. * Rahelta , a strip of rand on the Red Sea under the nominal protection ot Italy , Is just now said to be coveted by France and Russia , while In Rome It Is asserted that English Influence Is being brought to bear upon the Italian government to part with it to the British empire. The other day , as waa told by a cable dispatch , a party of French marines landed there and only with drew after several sharp messages had passed between Rome and Parts. Rahelta Is said In official circles In London to be of as much Importance to England as to Itaf/ . This is recognized as a fact In Rome. The territory lies half way between the French settlement of Tadjura and Obok , and the Italian colony ot Aseab , forming the west ern coast of the Btraltn of Bab-el-Mandeb. It ! believed that In hostile hands In the case ot war , It might neutralise the dmppr ? tance ot the I land ot Psrlm , which , as a possession of Great Britain , represents the key to the Red Sea from the Indian ocean. With the exception ot this possible strate gical ! Importance , Rahelta Is recognized In Paris as well as In Rome , but perhaps not In London , to be next to worthless. The coast Is almost completely deserted. Ten miles to the north of the point opposite P rlm there is a small and Inconvenient bay , where only small ships can eater. Thence n path , about five miles long , leads to the village known as Rahelta , capital of the region , and the only settlement of any Importance. Prof. Glusjppe Sapeto , the representative of the Rubattlno Steamship company in the Red sea , was the founder ot the Italian possessions In this part ot Africa , as he purchased for Italy the terri tory of Assab and waa Intrusted latsr on with the task ot enlarging it. December IS , 1880 , acting on behalf of the Italian government , he signed with Bercban , the self-styled sultan of Rahelta , the treaty by which the latter accepted the Italian pro tectorate , receiving in exchange a yearly money compensation , Not long ago tb question of Rahelta was brought up in the British House of Commons , when the rumor got abroad that Menelek , whose vassal , the "sultan" of Rahelta is , had ceded the.ter ritory to Russia. Since the defeat of the Italians by the Negus , three years ago , their traders nave practically abandoned that part of the coast Some significant figures have Just been published by M. Noel , a Frenchman , show ing the rates of mortality In tht French army , especially In the colonies. It ap pears that while the mortality of French officers In France In 1895 was 5.07 per 1,000 , In the "colonies" It was 39.8 , nearly eight times as great. It was greatest among lieutenants , especially the unaccllmatlzcd , In detached posts , least among seniors leas exposed. Among the troops the mortality I per 1,000 WM a * follow * ! Franco , 6.01 ; At- ' * > , 12.27 ! Tunis , 11.4 ! tht marine , It ; colonial army , 42.9 $ , Here the men In lh "colonies" sufferrd times just seven M much as At home. It scorns that the Itst men are removed from their accustomed X i . . work , the smaller their mortality ; the " * * r moro exacting the military aervlcs required , the greater the mortality ; the moro men uro "selected , " the less the mortality In the army , Th Inference Is that many of the rccrulU In the French army undergo a very superficial medical examination on conscription and are really unfit for active service , tropical or other- wise. The highest death rale In France among soldiers la under twenty-three years of age ; after this mortality declines. ! the various garrisons In France the lowest mortality , 3.18 per 1,000 , Is at Lille , and the highest , 8.01 , at Clcrmont ; chiefly due , In 1S95 , .to Influenza , pulmonary diseases , and typhoid fe\cr. In Algeria the death rate Is Influenced essentially by typhoid fever. Both thcoo death rates are low compared with 103.1 In Madagascar and 107.1 In the Sudan ( West Africa ) . In the home army the heaviest mortality Is dur ing the period of Instruction that Is , num bers of French conscripts succumb In trainIng - Ing ; In the colonies It Is the prolonged ex posure which kills. General Lord Kitchener's appeal for funds to found a Gordon Memorial college at Khartoum was responded to with truly remarkable alacrity , the 1500,000 required having been subscribed within a week. No memorial ot the hero ot Khartoum could have been devised that would have beta moro fitting than the establishment ot a seat of learning at the place where be wai overtaken by the deluge of barbarism. Ac cording to Lord Kitchener the Institution will carefully abstain from all efforts In proselyting , It being considered preferable to make good Mohammedans than bad. Christians of the natives. In this under taking , ns In others , the Sirdar bids ( air to provo his sagacious foresight. There are 20,000,000 Moslems In Kordofan and In the Bahr-el-Ghazel region , nnd their recon ciliation to British rule Is quite as Impor tant as was the defeat of the Dervlfhe * .
