Time for Nuptials of Daughter of the. President is Fixed. Washington, Dec. 15.—Representa tive Longworth spent .Thursday after noon at the White House, where soma Mends had been asked to congratu late Miss Roosevelt and himself. They also had the pleasure of seeing the very handsome diamond ring which Mr. Longworth has long had in readinefes for the emergency which he faced yesterday. It is a hoop of dia monds, perfectly matched stones, five in number, in a dull gold band. Miss Roosevelt Is having reset and will pre sent to her fiance tfie famous pearl ring which was presented her by the Sultan of Sulu. It was announced to day to the friends who called to extend congratulations that the wftddlng will be on February 17, probably at 4 o'clock though this latter Is not quite decided. It is also likely that Miss Roosevelt will jvear her mother's wedding gown, which has been carefully preserved for her by her grandmother. Mrs. George C. Lee, of Brookline, Mass. This gown was to have been the one worn by Jrfiss Roosevelt when she made her debut four years ago, but Mrs. Roosevelt dis suaded her from this and advised her to keep the gown for such an occas sion as that set for February. Miss Roosevelt drove to the capitol yesterday with Representative Long worth in the smart high cart which her father gave her about a year ago. She did not alight, however, to receive the congratulations of the" assembled statesmen, but after a smiling good-by to her future* husband drove directly back tq the White House, where she has been busy all day answering telephone calls and telegrams. As a little more than two months remain for the wedding the details are being hurried somewhat. Mr. Longworthy is still un able to say whether he can get away for* a long European trip, and Miss Alice, who is ambitious for him and determined not to interfere with his political prospects, Is willing to put off the Journey even until next autumn. After the wedding the young couple will, after a short visit to Mrs. Long worth, rent a furnished house here and will also spend some time at the White House. Mr. Longworth is anxious to bring his bride to his home city, Cin cinnati, and he is planning such a trip just as soon as things lull a little in congress during the post Lenten sea son.' '-v..:-? 

VALIDITY IS UPHELD United States Circuit Court of Ap peals Hands Down Decision Estab lishing Validity of the So-called "In contestable Clause" in Life Insur anse Policies. Boston, Dec. 15.—A decision estab lishing the validity of the so-called "incontestable clause" in life insurance policies, was handed down yesterday in the United States circuit court of appeals. TIhe insurance company claimed an agreement as to the In contestability was merely -conditional •upon the insurance having been in force because at the time of delivery of the policy the insured was not in good health. The coitrt finds the ar gument as to the aJbsence of continu ous force Is predicated upoin the fact of not appearing In the policy. The court declares that if the defendant's argument Is adopted, the policy in tsead of being inoontestable, Is con testable always. *£"V: t" if* k. *.^5 7k im*"i -S '\tx h4^-£' Railway Magnate Tells His Side of Quarrel With Ryan About The Equitable RYAN SAID WANTED HIS HELP Harriman Claims Ryan Asked Him to Aid in Getting His Nominee Elected Chairman of the Board Insurance Committee Probing Equitable Pur chase. 'i New Tork, Dec. 15.—E. K. Harriman was called to the stand when the insur ance investigating committee opened its session today. Harriman said he learned) of the sale of the Hyde stock on the day that Ryan bought it. He telephoned to Ryan and asked him if he had bought It. "Ryan said the pur chase was conditional," said Harri man, "and that he wanted to see me and talk with me, and wanted my help. I criticised his plan and wanted to know what he meant by it. Ten or fifteen minute's later I went to Ryan's office. He told me he had decided to buy the stock and said it was time for him to make a name for himself. He said he had decided to buy Hyde's stock, providing he could get his nom inee elected chairman of the board. He said he had made a good deal of money and never had done anything to make a name for himself. I ques tioned his motive. He had told me he wanted my help that I was the one man in New York whose help he de sired." "What kind or help?" asked Hughes. "To help him get his nominee elect ed chairman .of the board replied Harriman. Asked upon what ground he had criticized Ryan's plan, Harriman ^re plied: "Well, it was rather staggering to anybody, that Ryan wanted to control the Equitable or should have control Of it." "I told him," continued Harriman. ,"that if I was satisfied he was acting from a pure and unselfish motive in the Interests of the Equitaible I would help him. He told me his plan. I did not tell him then I wanted a share in the Hyde stock. I assisted him to get his nominee elected, because I be came satisfied that with Morton in oharge aired if Ryan were sincere the affairs of the Equitable would be safe. In another interview witlh ^tyan at wWch Root and Cravath were present, I said to Ryan: 'You want my co-oper ation?' He said, 'Yes.' I said: 'I will take half your stock If you will let me name two trustees.' Ryan refused and told me I had promised to help him, if I was satisfied. I said this was my way of toeing satisfied. I do not rememlber what else I said. I may have said/what these gentlemen said I did. I intended, unless I was satisfied of his motive, to oppose his control of the society and thought it ought to be stopped. "I know whom he had selected as trustees, ibut did mot know his plan to divest himself of control of the stock. I wanted two trustees independent of Ryan. I thinik that any trustees named as Ryan named" them must be to a certain extent under, his control, especially as he had named a man out of his own organization as president. I •did not demand the right to name two trustees, but merely tlhat they should be Independent of Ryan. I offered to turn my stock over to the society, if all did. I don't see wihy he sihould not make the trustees a hundred if his motives were pure. I was not a phil anthropist an'd did not consider it such for him to pay $2,500,000 which he was going to get out it when lie got con trol of the society. It was because of my interest in the Equitable that I wanted a share. There was no possi bility of a panic. No one but Ryan had such a view. I doubt whether he had it." Harriman said that he was instru mental in preventing bills from being introduced in the legislature, to aid one faction in the Equitable to get control of the society. 'It has been openly charged," said Hughes, "that you get your political influence thru your rela tions with Odell." "I should say that Odell gets his po litical influence thru his relations with me," responded Harriman. He said that he is in politics and has some po litical influence, and he did not con sider it improper if he did use his po litical influence against Ryan. "Noth ing improper in Ryan's conduct of the Equitable has yet come to my atten tion," he said, "and I have not had time to attend to it. If anything had come to my attention I should have acted." Harriman said that when the move was on foot to give control of the Equitable to James W. Alexander and friends, by means of legislatve action at Albany, he wired certain persons at Albany to keep him Informed as to the progress such proceedings might make. Persons from whom he had requfested Information, lie said were Governor Higgins and the late Speaker Nixon. Before giving the names, Hurrimar. consulted his counsel, saying he wished to spare the men, and not bring their numes into newspaper headlines. Further on in his testimony Harri man, in speaking on the subject of Odell and political influence, said: "Mr. Hughes, you spoke about Odell, and my having political influence because of my relations or affiliation wjth him. I would like to say that all last spring during the Equitaible controversy, be tween its inside factions, that Odell was not here, nor was he communi cated with aljout it, so that he had no hand in t'he matter Whatever." "And during that period were ypu In consultation with members of legisla ture?" asked Hughes. "Not specially. I had insurance matters watched at Albany to see what attempts were being made to use the legislature improperly." "When you refer to the possession o.f political influence thru relations to you, you mean because of the many important mutters in which you are Interested for which you stand?" "Yes, in many ways." "Haven't you in prominent position ieferred to, a great many subjects that come before the legislature?" "No, have no special interest In many matters that come before tin legislature." "Well, I was referring to matters af fecting the railroads, banks and trust companies." "No, I never had any hand in that." "Well, I don't just understand what you meant by political influence thru relation to you," said Hughes. "Any common citizen has some In fluence." said the witness, and If any body in politics can get the friendship and backing of the people who have no political end to serve, why that gives them more or less standing." "Now, Odell might resent such a statement as that. I don't nknow whether he would or not, but I think if I was in politics I would try to ge: as many men as possible of promir ence to be friends of mine." Harriman Contradictions. Hughes read Harriman's previouo testimony In which he said he did not try to buy the Hyde stock and Harri jnan said he did not then have In mind his attempt to get the Ryan hold ings, but meant he made no attempt to buy the stock direct from Hyde. Har riman asked Hughes If he did not think that answer was proper and Hughes said he thought it was that Harriman had in mind only that he made no offer to Hyde. Hughes asked what Harriman did at Albany to pre vent mutuallzation of the Equitable. Harriman objected to telling, but Hughes insisted and Harriman said that in the Equitable trouble Hyde of fered to trustee the stock as| Ryan dii later. The suh-committee- trncs s' 

O'CLOCK. EDITION. MARSH ALLTO WN, IOWA, FRIDAY. DECEMBER 15,1905 6V~. the Equitable had recommended mutuall zation. It was put into the hands of lawyers to take care of. This was at Albany. "The Alexander faction went to Albany to oppose the plan, said the witness, and Mr. Pratt went there to represent the committee of policy holders. .. Harriman Saw Higgins. "I was neutral not with either fac tion. I was in communication with men who were to inform me if there was any possibility of the Alexander faction succeeding. I do not want to tell you what t'hey reported, "tfhere was mo bill introduced. I took steps with some members of the legislature to let me known if the bill was intro •duced. I told them what I wanted to know. 1 don't want to go further, but I will consult -with counsel and if they say I should I will do so." Senator Armstrong consented and the three men went into an ante room to confer When they returned Harriman said 'he had had communication wltJh t!he late Speaker Nixon and Governor Higgins. He requested that if anything came to their notice that the people in the Equitable opposed to, that the Alex ander faction ibe notified. The umder stan'dln'g was not that the governor or speaker Should take any other action. Harriman in leaving the witmess stand said his reason for wanting to keep Higgins' anid Nixon's name out of the newspaper headlines is that most peo ple read only the headlines.

Special to Times-Republican. Toledo, Dec. 15.—The case of the state of Iowa vs. John Gunning, charg ed with the shooting of S. E. Berger, went to the jury this morning, and an early verdict is looked for. The de fense rested its case late yesterday afternoon and the arguments before the jury were concluded with the ex ception of the closing plea for the state which was made by Judge J. R. Caldv ell this morning. The court then instructed the jury. It is generally believed that the state has made a strong case. There is, how ever, considerable sympathy for the de fendant on account of his age. It is believed he was a victim, of his temper more than a desire to kill his neighbor. The sole line of defense, however, was along the theory that the gun was ac cidentally discharged while an attempt to disarm Gunning was being made. This view was combatted by the state's most credible witness who claimed Berger was shot before the attempt to disarm Gunning was made. The sec ond trial of Gunning for attempting to kill D. Hinegardner will be continued until next term. DIVORCE BEFORE WEDDING. Intended Husband #f Mt. Ayr Girl Re turns to Costa Rican.,Home. Special to Times-Republican.
