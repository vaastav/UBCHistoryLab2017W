IMPORTANT FEATURES Of Some of the most important parts of President McKinley's message to congress are herewith presented to our readers: that is to say the subjects that have claim ed the people's attention the past year: viz: the Chinese affair, the Philippine trouble, army recom mendations, trusts, etc. THE CHINESE 

QUESTION. Concerning a settlement of the Chinese troubles the President says: "The Russian proposition look- in to the restoration of imperial power in Pekin has been accepted as in full consonance with our own desires, for we have held and hold that effective reparation for wrongs suffered and an enduring settlement that will make their recurrence impossible can best be brought about under an authority which the Chinese nation rever ences and obeys. While so doing we forego no jot of our undoubt ed right to exact exemplary and deterrent punishment of the re sponsible authors and actors of the criminal acts through which we and other nations have suf fered grievous injury. "For the real culprits, evil counselors who have misled the judgment and diverted sovereign authority to their own guilty ends, full expiation becomes im perative within the rational limit of retributive justice. "I regard as one of the essential factors of durable justice the se curity of adequate guarantees of liberty of faith, since insecurity to those nations who may embrace alien creeds is scarcely a less ef fectual assault upon the right of foreign worship and teaching than would be the direct invasion thereof. "The matter of indemnity for our wronged citizens is a question of great concern. Measured in money alone, sufficient reparation may prove to be beyond the abil ity of China to meet. All powers concur in emphatic disclaimers THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. should be unselfishly discharged, and devolved upon this govern ment a moral as well as material responsibility toward these mil lions whom we have freed from an oppressive yoke. 'WARDS OF THE NATION.' "I have on another occasion called the Filipinos 'the wards of the nation.' Our obligation as guardian was not lightly assumed. It must not be otherwise than honestly fulfilled, aiming first of all to benefit those who have come under our fostering care. It is our duty so to treat them that our flag may be no less beloved in the mountains of Luzon and by the sons of Mindanoa and Ne gros than it is at home, that there, as here, it shall be revered as the symbol of liberty, enlight enment and progress in every av enue of development. "The Filipinos are a race quick to learn and to profit by knowl edge. He would be rash who, with the teachings of contempo raneous history in view, would fix a limit to the degree of culture and advancement yet within reach of these people, if our duty toward them be faithfully per formed. 

ARMY RECOMMENDATIONS. "It must be apparent that we will require an army of about 60,000, and that during present conditions in Cuba and the Phil ippines the President should have authority to increase the force to the present number of 100,000. Included in this number, author ity should be given to raise native troops in the Philippines up to 15,000, which the Taf t commission belives will be more effective in detecting and suppressing guer rillas, assassins and ladrones than our own soldiers. "I renew the recommendation ! made in my last annual message to avoid. It must not be used to invite conflicts, not for oppres sion, but the more effective main tenance of those principles of equality and justice upon which our institutions and happiness depend. Let us keep always in mind that the foundation of our government is liberty, its super structure peace. William McKini.ky. 'Executive Mansion, Dec. 3, 1900.' EL 

PASO URGES MINERS TO ATTEND. of any purpose of aggrandizement that congress provide a special through dismemberment of the medal of honor for the volunteers, I am disnosed to think regulars, sailors and marines on empire due compensation may be made in part by increased guarantees of security for foreign rights and immunities, and most important of all, by the opening of China to equal commerce to all the world. These views have been and will be earnestly advocated by our representatives. "The government of Russia has put forward the suggestion duty in the Philippines who vol untarily remained in the service after their terms of enlistment had expired." TRUSTS. The trusts receive little atten tion in the President's message. Refering to this evil, lie says: "In my last annual message to congress I called attention to the necessity of early action on a that in the event of protracted j remedy of such evils as might be divergency of views in regard to found to exist in connection with combinations of capital organized into trusts, and again to invite indemnities, the matter may be relegated to the court of arbitra tion at The llague. I favorably attention to mv discussion on the incline to this, believing that subject at that time. high tribunal could not fail to reach a solution no less conducive to stability and enlarged prosper ity of China itself than immedi ately beneficial to the powers." THE 

PHILIPPINE TROUBLE. On the Philippine question the President embodies the report of the Taft commission, and adds: "Later reports from the com mission show more encouraging COMMERCIAL EXPANSIONISTS CAUTIONED. In conclusion the President sounds a note of warning with reference to extravagant legisla tion, saying: "In our great prosperity we I must guard against the danger it invites of extravagance in gov ernment expenditures and appro priations and the chosen repre- advancc toward insuring the ben- scntatives of the people will, I efits of liberty and good govern ment to Filipinos in the interest of humanity and with the aim of building up an enduring, self support and self-administering community in these far eastern seas. I would impress upon the congress that whatever legislation may be enacted in respect to the Philippine Islands should be along j these generous lines.

CONVENTION (ALL TO MEET IN EL PASO JANUARY !6tH, 1901. The project for holding a meet ing of mining men in El Paso, January 16, 1901, for the purpose of organizing a mining associa tion to cover the country tributary to El Paso is steadily making headway. At the preliminary meeting, held November 3, a com mittee, consisting of Messrs. Felix Martinez, A. W. Gifford, Major S. M. Davis and H. S. Church, was appointed to raise funds and make other necessary preliminary arrangements for circulating a call for the meeting. The com mittee met a few days ago and approved a draft of a call to be circulated. The committee also decided to 'send Major S.M. Davis and Mr. R. L. Wooten out among the mining towns of the surround ing country to call upon the lead ing mining men personally and secure their signatures to the call. Mr. Wooton will cover the Mexi can field tributary to El Paso, along the Mexican Central and Sierra Madre railways. Major Davis will cover New Mexico and Arizona. Major Davis will start tomorrow on this mission over the El Paso and Northeastern rail way. The above committee easily secured by subscription a pledge of sufficient funds to defray the expenses of circulating the call and other preliminary arrange ments. Following is the lan guage of the call: "Whereas, the mining business of the southwestern districts has grown so rapidly during the last two years; and, "Whereas, the promotion, de velopment and the best interests of the mining production demand an organization for the better and more advantageous understand ing and protection of these inter ests; and, "YThercas, the city of El Paso, Texas, is by far the most central ly located, and is possessed of better facilities and advantages beneficial to the requirements of the mining business; "Therefore, we, the under signed, hereby unite in calling a meeting of mining men and oth ers interested to be held at El Paso, Texas, January 16, 1901, for the purpose of organizing a mining association to represent western Texas, New Mexico, Ar- economy which in a season of na nd northern Mexico, plenty husbands for the future In this era of business activity and opportunity caution is not untimely.
