"Whisky has d'Wio a vast deal of harm in thernlfed states" He would continue to tax It in order to reduce Its consumption, and that it may do some good. The temperance people will please take notice. He t hen appeals to national pride by urgln? the ex )<e?diture of a part of the surplus in seaboard forti- j flc?uons, and commends to democratic perusal ' the powerful le'rer on the snhj-ct by the | law Aamnei J.

The wool-grower^ ! are then defended against the attacks <4 the message, and a warning given to the south- l ??rn states of a check in their present progress if. j in pursuant of the new policy, they get free Iron I and coal, while tobacco Is taxed. Mr. Blaine would J contlnue'o tax whisky so long as there Is whisky | to tax, and when the National tiovermnenf should nave bo use for the money, would divide the tax ! among the Federal I nlon, with the specific object of lightening the fax on real estate.

Too great vigilance in correcting this notab.e source ot destructive nres cannot be ?>&*r*ed. Another danger which Is of the season In preparation If not in appearance Is that which results from cut ting for use ice so polluted as to convey infectious disease. The Xcw York Su? publishes scientific oplm.>ns which cast suspicion upon much of the Ice tut from the Hudson for use ?u New York city. Typhoid fever bacteria, the scientists say, can stand freering, and by modern met hods of examination are found In large quan tities in m -'.*ed ice. if the s-wage from Troy, Albany and smaller places on the Hudson can dahij^roustj pollute the river for a distance 0f thtrtv miles frotu Albany, as assr-feil. it will be .d1 lsable for cutters of ).e in tvthr r localities to take care that they are not also storing tjpaoiU I?v?t an>t choi ra to <Uspen~e to their customers.
