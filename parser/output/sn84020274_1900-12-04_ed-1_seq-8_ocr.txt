He who lights against right, truth and logic and yet would justify his course to men must be an artful dodger. The Globe-Democrat has shown clumsiness rather than art in its dodging. When recently The Kepubllc con victed the Globe-Democrat of willfully misstating the circumstances attending the election, the Globe-Democrat re sorted to the thug's device of "starting a rough house" by calling The Republic names. When now The Republic points out that the Nesblt law was a protest against Julius Wurzburger as Election Commissioner, the Globe-Democrat dodges with, 'The Republic and Its re formers accept the Nesbit law. Thnt settles it." This sort of logic may prove entertain ing and satisfying to tiie Globe-Democrat and the ring it represents. It is the same sort of argument that Mayor Zieg eniiein used when he felicitated his fellow-citizens on the fact that the moon was still shining. St. Louisans are neither charmed with the adroitness nor deceived by the logic of such an artifice. HIGH OLD LORRY TIMES. There was every reason why the open ing session of the Congress now begin ning the ninety days of legislative work with which Its life will terminate should have attracted to Washington a vast horde of lobbyists, attorneys, secret agents of monopoly corporations and others w hose object it is !o influence, for gain, the making of laws In the national capital. Although tl.s is a closing session of Congress, it comes at n time when a. President has just been re-elected to succeed himself, thus receiving an in dorsement of ids policies which shall embolden him to push them to their ex tremes lengths. Mr. McKlnley's policies, dictated by Mark Hanna in the interests of the trusts, an: such as open up a vast field lor lobbyists and monopoly agents. There's to be a lot of syndicate legisla tion, contract letting and creating of places for hungry office-seekers. The tinm to get jour "inflooence" at work is right now. It Is safe to say, therefore, thnt all the class Interests which are in line for benefit under the sway of commercial ized politics will be generously repre sented in Washington from now until the holidays. Tho American people will in all likelihood be the most Inadequate ly represented clement. This is because the Republican party is in power, pledged to dothe bidding of the trusts, and liecatise the trusts are hostile to the people. 

IMPORTANT TO HANNA. It was characteristic that Mark Han na. in a consideration of the most impor tant lulls 1o come before Congress in the session now begun, should have placed the Haiinn-Paync-Fryc-Staudard Oil ship-subsidy bill second on ills list, In sisting that it is "a just measure, de voted to the upbuilding of the American merchant marine." Even the members of Mr. Hanna's own party in the National Congress fail, as a body, to agree witii him as to the urgent necessity for the swift passage of the shiiHsubsIdy bill, or that it is a just and widely beneficent measure. It has been stated by at least one Repub lican Senator that the ship-subsidy bill may easily await the action of the next Cougres", giving place to moie necessary 'legislation during the present short ses sion. A Republican Congressman from the President's own State and Mark Hanna's own district finds himself un able to support the measure because he is opiwsed to the subsidy Idea, the tax ing of the many for the benefit of the . lew. It is now apparent, however, that Hnnna proposes to push tho Ilnnna-rayne-Frye-Standnrd Oil shln-suliely bill through in this session, as hclns sec oiiil in importance on the. list of urgent legislation. It is certainly of importance to Hanna, promising to vastly increase his wealth and that of the syndicate of which lie Is the head. And tills is the tlnal test after all, under the McKinley regime the test of a law's alue to Hanna and the syndicate. It is in order to expect the early passage f the ship subsidy bill. 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President McKinlcy's message to the Cougiess which coiiened in Washing ton yesterday for the completion of lis laboi-, is of exceptional historic aliie as outlining, at the dawn f a new cen tury, the p.tlio of a great Government which had but just been born when tho present century began. The message recites facts which Jus tify national pride. It oilers indispu table proof of the most marvelous na tional gtowth kuowu to the world's his tory. It necessarily shows that this Government now stands in the front rank of Hie world's greatest Powers, a Government that logically exercises the strongest single iutluence in the settle ment of all international iuestiotis of the first magnitude. It Is, perhaps, inevitable that great nnd sudden dangers to the American spirit and the true American policy should have been brought into being by this Government's recent tremendous in crease of power anil prestige. It may be taken as similarly logicul that Mr. McKinley, standing for the party most susceptible to the glamour of the new prospect of world-wide territorial ac quisition created by the results of the war with Spain for the liberating of Cuba, should iu his message advocate a foreign policy which is more or less of a surrender to the sudden temptation. It is al.so logical that the President should have made no effective utterance in opposition to the ominous growth of the trust evil, a growth for which ids party's friendliness towards the trusts is so largely responsible. The President's message is a confes sion that, in so far as it is possible to Mr. McKinley and the Republican party, the Government is to 1h administered on lines of imperialism and of class-privilege that are foreign to the spirit of its founders. Politically speaking. Mr. Mc Kinley has good warrant for the tone of ids message. His campaign for re-election was necessarily made on these is sues, the Democratic assault on the trusts and imperialism being exception ally fierce. The people at the polls sup ported Mr. McKinley in this conlllct of J oninlon. All that now remains to be seen Is whether or not the people best knew what was good for themselves and for the country when they extended the Mc Kinley leae of power for four years more. Tiie President himself is faithful, in Ids message, to those tilings for which he stood In the campaign which ended In his re-election to the Presidency. 

KEEP THEM DISTINCT. In his recent aide discussion of the city's condition and prospects Mr. Fred erick N. Jndson seems to have confused the evils that arise from misgovemmeut with those that arise from Charter and constitutional limitations. Accordingly lie reached the conclusion that St. Louis's troubles arose as much from an antiquated Charter and from unjust obligations and limitations placed upon the city by the State Constitution as from municipal inisgoverument. Reflection will readily show that the immediate troubles of the city are not due to Charter defects or to constitu tional limitations but to Ziegcnhciulsm. It Is known that St. Louis has Jogged along prosperously as recently as three years ago with street lights and street cleaning even by block patrol, with enough money to feed its paupers and to buy medicines for Its indigent sick and to build an occasional street and sewer. It is known that, so far from accumu lating a deficit at the rate of .fl.'ii.tiOo a year, St. Louis built a new !f2.0m.(KHl City Hall with current revenues without issuing a single bond. These undoubted facts prove beyond doubt that we can under the present Charter and State Constitution get along comfortably. St. Louis is not doing so and has not been doing so for several years past. The present trouble of St. Louis is due to Ziegenheinisni and to nothing elss. It Is equally admitted that if St. Louis Is to make Itounds and leaps forward, as she should do in preparation for the World's Fair, Charter nnd constitutional changes are imperative. This is nothing new. It was n-eognized years ago. A Charter Amendment Commission sat and recommended Charter changes dur ing Mayor Walbridge's term. When le eently Charter amendments were voted on by St. Louians they were defeated because of lack of confidence in Mayor Ziegenheln and ids helpers and because plain public demands like that for the merit system were disregarded in the submission of the amendments. St. Louis's Charter Is antiquated and the city Is unfairly limited by the State Constitution, tint that does not cause tho city's present troubles. That prevents marked progress. It does not compel retrogression, and municipal government has retrograded very seriously. 

COMPLETE THE FUND. There could be no more stimulating in centive for friends of the World's Fair than the knowledge that with the com pletion of the local subscription of ?."., 000,000 the great enterprise will be placed on the firmest financial footing and that the most vigorous and active work on the Exposition itself will imme diately follow. The effect of this definite and assured endeavor will be felt not only in St, Louis and throughout Missouri, but in Washington and extending direct to every State Iu the Union. In St. Isolds the permanent World's Fair organization will be formed and the World's Fair officers elected to direct the undertaking to its successful culmina tion. In Jefferson City the General Assem bly of Missouri will promptly take up the work of preparing for a State ex hibit that shall reflect due credit on the World's Fair State. In Washington the Congress now in session w'.H uked for the appropria tion from the Federal Government al ready agreed upon. In the ether States of the Union the various Legislatures will beieqtichted to authorize ami provide for State exhibits that shall illustrate this country's prog ress in tiie arts and sciences, in com merce and Industry. The foundation for all this work, as for the entire fabric of the World's Fair, must of necessity be found in the com pleted voluntary subscription of .'.tHHi, 000 from the people of the World's Fair Cltj. The appeal to civic pride iu this essential is potent indeed. The marked enthusiasm now manifested iu behalf of the World's Fair by St. Louisans should speedily culminate iu the completion of the local fund. The announcement to the woild that St. Louis's investment of $.-.,000,000 iu tiie World's Fair has been made will proe the World's Fair ear nestness of St. Louisans beyond all fur ther question. This announcement should lie forth coming before Congress adjourns for the holidays. Every St. Louisaii should as sist in making it ccttain. A united etTort to this end Is now inpcrathely in order. Complete the World's Fair fund. Woi Id's Fair success depends upon it. DE WET AND MARION. McKinleyitcs will doubtless be en raged anew by W. T. Stead, the English man, who pees lit to call the Roer Gen eral De Wet the Francis Marlon of o day and to point out that the cruel war of extermination now being waged by the English In South Africa is similar to the relentless tactics employed against Marion in the last century. This thing of finding among the patriot Roers of the present time a reproduction in tyie and spirit of the patriot Ameri cans of 1770 is embarrassing to the Mc Kinley administration, which lias as sisted England In crushing the Rocrs-. McKlnie. ite organs will have no good word for this man Stead, who dares to rebuke his own Government ami to pub licly note the American Government's betrayal of the American spirit. When England's imperialist newspapers begin calling Stead a traitor and a liag-furler you will see the Tory organs of McKin ley imperialism fall promptly into line and take up the hue and cry. It Is nec essary that they shall discredit such a man he dares to hold human rights higher than syndicate plots for conquest and the looting of weaker nations. Down with the idealistic fool: Nevertheless there are many Ameri cans and Englishmen whose hearts sick en at sight of the great and. sinful tragedy licing enacted in South Africa. In the honesty of their souls they can not call wrong right, nor rejoice in the national extinction of a manly and God fearing people. And it may be that this spirit shall prevail against the Mark Hanna and Cecil Rhodes commercial syndicate spirit, ultimately saving the Roers from subjection to an alien gov ernment. God lias not yet finally judged between the two peoples. A Republican party organ thus voices what seems to be the most unique claim to consideration that has yet been put forward In politics: "In consideration of the magnificent race Mr. Flory made for Governor, it would certainly be a very graceful act on the part of Gov ernor Dockery to appoint Mr. Flory to the vacancy iu the office of Railroad Commissioner." Announcement of Governor Joseph W. McClurg's death seemed to bother the Republican party organs. Some said he was "the last Republican Governor of Missouri." Others seemed to smell an unpleasant inference in this and said he was "the latest Republican Governor of Missouri." Mr. McKinlcy's message to Congress declares. In effect, that he shall continue working for empire and the trusts, and that he believes the people at the polls in November sanctioned such service. One noteworthy attraction Is pos sessed by tiie session of Congress which has Just opened: It will make the $3,000, 000 Federal appropriation for the Louis iana Purchase Woild's Fair. It was natural that the President's message should have a good word for the ship-subsidy bill. Mark Hanna, the bill's greatest lienelieiary, doesn't elect Presidents for his health. First and foremost among the Impor tant duties awaiting the incoming Gen eral Assembly of Missouri is the electlou of the best Democrat aailable for Speaker of the House. Washington just at present Is the par adise of lobbyists and the secret agents of trust monopolies. Rich pickings of imperial loot and special privileges con stitute the at miction. When the people of St. Louis lift their chic slogan of' "Nothing Impossible!" It means just what it says and it's sound ing iu splendid World's Fair ohnuc right now. It is appalling to think what an awful brand of politics would figure in the Wot Id's Fair movement if Zelgenhien istn and the Globe-Democrat could have their way. Is it the fault of the Nesbit bill that St. Louis's paj rolls were recently bur dened witii such atiame as that of Judge of Election Alirenhosterbae imcr? What a pity that the new century which comes in at midnight of Decern lier ol will find St. Louis in almost pri meval darkness. Reading between the lines of the Pres ident's message, Americans learn that they are In for four yean; r.f imperialism and trustisiu. St. Louis's foundation for the World's Fair a local subscription of $3,000,000 will be of a solidity appropriate for the Solid City. March of the Christina Children.
