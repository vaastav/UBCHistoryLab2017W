-- --(KlW Mxsaassi fi i, t 1 P, i 'V V s f titrate ftMfil "WEDNESDAY, DEC. 10, 1884. The reputation of a newspaper ib not made upon prevarication or downright falsehood. On matters which are plainly in the mind of the people, the pettifogger's coloring of facts is simply disgusting. Fifteen indictments have been found by the U. S. grand jury in ses sion at Omaha against persons in Gage county, charged with frauds in reference to the sale of the Otoe In dian lands. It was thought at the time that there wa3 considerable meanness going. Congress met on the 1st, and the president's message received and read. No business of importance transacted. In a few days members will arrange business and go to work in earnest, and it is to be hoped that their work in the way of law making, &c., will be of benefit to the nation. The Pierce Elkhorn Valley Ntxcs, the Times and other papers of North Nebraska arc advocating the appointment of Dr. Hear as TJ. S. Marshal, in case a democrat ib to be pnt in place. The Dr. is able, honor able, gentlemanly, and his appoint ment would doubtless satisfy the great body of Nebraska democrats. Our exchanges are calling for radi cal changes in our revenue laws, more especially those referring to the col lection of taxes. The five per cent penalty which is to be added after Jan. 1st, seems to be the main object ive point of attack. A little attention could also be very judiciously given to the twenty per cent portion of the law. Rev. T. B. Lemax, of this state, left the other day for Baltimoro to at tend the centennial conference to be held in that city from the 9th to the 17th of December. This conference is held to commemorate the organiza tion of the M. E. chnrch, which took place in Baltimore City, December, 1784. Rev. Leman was appointed by the board of bishops to represent Nebraska in that conference. Concerning railroad legislation by the next legislature the Central City Nonpareil remarks, "Let the legisla ture do its duty aud the republican party will be covered with glory. Let it do nothing aud it will be cov ered with odium and be buried be neath righteous indignation." In an other place the samo paper remarks that 'the coming legislature can look for a lively kick if it fails to give the state suitable railroad legislation."' It is claimed at this late date that Booth killed Lincoln because he did not pardon Beall, the confederate spy, and that lie did not assassinate the president for any political reasons whatever. This icniarkable informa tion has been communicated by letter to a prominent ex-union officer in Baltimore. The facts and circum stances surrounding: and connected with the assa-sination of president Lincoln all tend to contradict the statements in this wonderful letter, and prove it to be false in every par ticular. General Lor an and wife were heartily received at Washington the other evening by several hundred citizens, friends, who called at their residence to welcome them back to the capitoi. A section of the marine band was in attendance and the house was decorated from top to bottom, outside and in, with bauuers, lanterns and flowers. The parlors and library of the mansion were crowded with ladies and gentlemen, while those for whom thrre was no standing room filed through in procession, paying their respects with hand shaking and words ot welcome in passiug. Tiik.kk is a universal demaud in Nebraska for a law fixing the maxi mum of railroad tare at three cents a mile, aud also making a reduction on freights. The Fremont Tribune re marks : There is no reason why passenger rates in Nebraska should remain at four cents per mile when they are only three cents on the east and Kan sas on the south. Neither is there any reason or justice in paying one half or two-thirds us much for haul ing froight from Omaha to Fremont an is charged for hauling it from Chicago to Omaha. It is hardly a fair proposition cither to ask a farm er to give the railways one bushel of wheat or two of corn to haul another to market. Tun Ashland Gazette gives a sad account of Lew Cropscy, formerly of Lincoln, Neb., who at oue time stood well with his fellow men having en joyed many positions of honor aud trust in the state, among them secre tary of the state senate, and at one time TJ. S. consul to Chemnitz: he was admitted to I he hospital the other day at Washington, a brokcu-down, destitute man, a total wreck. lie had at one time a happy home one of the stateliest houses in Lincoln, and he waB happy with a wile and little ones. His wife wae compelled to obtain a divorce on account of his dissipation, and be became a wanderer on the face of the earth, and now occupies a char ity hospital. Wm. Tick of New York writes us: "Hope you have become reconciled to the election of Grover Cleveland. I assure you we of tbo state of New York are, and hope to have an honest administration." Being a reader of the Journal, Mr. Tice knows what wo thought of the situation. We confess, now, in the light of a few circumstances, to a slight hope that -Cleveland is not altogether in har mony with the extreme southern wing of his party, and may be able to withstand their demands in a degree. We muEt say, however, to friend Tice, that "reconciliation" is hardly the word to describe pur feelings; en durance would be better. If the democracy, with Cleveland, can give us an honest, patriotic administra tion, the Journal, will be pleased, and partially reconciled to defeat Electiea Frad. It is generally admitted now by the citizens of Chicago that a fraud was committed upon the election returns in the second precinct of the eigh teenth ward in the Brand-Leman vote. The precinct is republican. The Blaine electors received 390 votes, the Cleveland electors 288 votes. On the night of election Leman the republi can candidate for senator bad 420 votes, and Brand 274. This was the report of the vote on the night of the election, and supposed to bo correct, and the evidence in the further inves tigation seems to prove beyond doubt that the ballots were tampered with and changed in pursuance of a pre meditated and carefully executed fraud. Among the circumstances adduced in proof of the fraud was the fact that the republican ticket was counterfeited with Brand's name substituted for Leman's, and that these spurious ballots were employed to the number of two hundred or thereabout, in order to establish the falsehood that Brand had carried the precinct, and, having thereby a ma jority of the votes in the district, was elected senator instead of Lemau. Since noting the facts above, the poll books, ballots, certificates, &c, were submitted to Governor Hamil ton who baB rendered a decision after a thorough investigation of the facts and evidence in the case he awards the certificate to Lemau. The decis ion of the Governor is very long iu reviewing the evidence and the cir cumstances surrounding the returns and we content ourselves with ono remark of the Governor in which he said he could not, in judgment and conscience, find that Brand was duly elected in a just and lawful maimer, or that he was elected at all, and that by the genuine returns that Leman received a majority of 304 votes, and is therefore elected. Mr. Vest offered a resolution in the senate directing investigation into leases of land in the Indian Ter ritory, for grazing or other purposes, by Indian tribes ; the number of acres embraced in said leases, their terms and persons or corporations becom ing lessees; also the circumstances under which the leases were made, means used in obtaining them, and whether authorized by law. Vest claims that these leases were obtained from the Indians by fraud and bribery. This resolution elicited some discussion and went over one day. In the house Follet, as a ques tion of privilege, presented a reso lution in which be desired to impeach Lot Wright, United States Marshal for the southern district of Ohio, of high crimes and misdemeanors for unsurping authority in violation of the law by appointing special and general deputy marshale to serve at the several voting precincts in Cin cinnati during the Ohio election, en couraging fraudulent voting and in timidating legal voters. Keifer made a point of order against the recep tion of the resolution, but the speaker overruled it, aod alter a long dis cussion the resolution was passed. Five men demanded hands up of tho passengers on the Little Rock, "Mississippi River & Texas road, last Saturday night within three miles of Little Rock, Ark. ; they stopped the train, took completo possession, switched the train, and the five mask ed robbers went through it, relieving the passengers of money and other valuables worth $4,000. They also broke open the express safe, obtaining about $3,000 more. A dispatch da ted the 7th says that bloodhounds were, early in the morning, put on tho trail of the robbers and followed straight into Little Rock. Before noon Joseph Cook, J. C. Jones, John Clifford, Charles Campbell aud a boy named Parker, had been arrested. Three of them have been identified as among the robbers. A report comes from Hamilton, Ohio, that George Snyder, a farmer, living near Darrlown, was arrested the other night charged with the mur der of his mother. She was about 75 years old, and had been missing for lour weeks. His 6tory about the matter is that he had paid his mother $125, interest on a mortgage she held on his farm, aud when taking her to tho railroad station ou her return home, two robbers demanded her money, when refuted, killed and buried her and made him promise by threats of death not to reveal it. The body was disinterred and found iu night clothes. The supposition is that he killed her in his own house. Recent news from private officials in India states that there is a danger ous condition of affairs in that coun try. The feelings of the natives were never so excited against England as at the present time, and foreign emi saries are at work among the natives stirring them up to strife and pre paring them to make an explosion. Officers in high command have sent to England urgent demands for au thority to form camps of refuge for women and children, in order to be ready in case of mutiny. The gov ernment baB been warned that it is on the eve of a great trial. The committee on organization of the independent Irish-Americans has decided to continue the assembly dis trict organizations under the name of the Irish-American Protective Union, and has adopted an address urging their fellow countrymen to organize Irish-American Protective Union clubs everywhere in the United States to resist English free-trade. The discovery has recently been made that the evasion of the tariff law is being practiced in New York and Boston, where galvanized- iron and steel sheets are being imported through the custom house at the same rates as tin plates. The duty on these sheets is three-fourths of a cent per pound more than tin plates. President Artknr'M Message to Congress. As is our custom, we give a very brief summary of the more important recommendations of tho president's message : A more precise and definite method for counting the electoral vote, is recommended. It is of the gravest importance that this question be solved before conflicting claims to the presidency shall again disturb the country. Onr relations with all foreign pow ers continue to be amicable. "Our relations with Germany, a country which contributes to our own some of the best elements of citizen ship, continuo to be cordial. The United States have extradition trea ties with several of the German states, but by reason of the confederation of these states under the imperial rule, the application of such treaties is not as uniform aud comprehensive as the interests of the two countries require, aud I, therefore, recommend tho open ing of negotiations for a siugle con vention of extradition, to embrace all the territory of tho empire." During the past year the increasing good will between our own govern ment aud that of Mexico has been variously manifested. The treaty of commercial reciprocity, concluded Jan. 20, 1SS3, haa been ratified and awaits the necessary tariff legislation of congress to become effective. This legislation will, 1 doubt not, be among the first measures to claim your attention, as a full treaty of commerce, navigation aud consular rights is much to be desired, and such a treaty, I have reason to believe, the Mexican government stands ready to conclude. Some embarrassment has been occasioned bv the failure of congress at its last session to provido means for the due execution of the treaty of July 29, 18S2, for the resur vey of the Mexican boundary and the relocation of boundary monuments with tho republic of Nicaraugua. A treaty has been concluded which au thorize the construction by the Uni ted States of a canal, railway aud telegraph line across the Nicarauguan territory. By the terms of this treaty sixty miles of the river San Juan, as well as Lake Nicaraugua, an inland sea forty miles in width, arc to con stitute a part of the projected enter prise. This covers for actual canal construction seventeen miles ou the Pacific side and thirty-six miles ou the Atlantic. To tho United States, whose rich territory on the Pacific is for the ordinary purpose of commerce practically cut off from communica tion by water with the Atlantic ports. The political and commercial advan tages of such a project can scarcely be overestimated. It is believed that when the treaty is laid bofore you the justice aud liberality of its pro visions will command universal ap proval at home and abroad. THE 

SOUTH AMERICAN COMMISSION. The Central and South American commission, appointed by authority of the act of July 7, 1884, will soon proceed to Mexico. It has been fur nished with instructions which will be laid before you. They contain a statement of the general policy of the government for enlarging its com mercial intercourse with American states. The commission have been actively preparing for their responsi ble task by holding conferences in the principal cities with merchants and with others interested in Central and South American trade. THE NEUTRALITY LAWS. The president recommends that the scope of the neutrality laws be so enlarged as to cover all acts of hostil ity committed iu our territory and aimed against the peace ot a friendly nation. NATURALIZATION LAWS. Special provisions applying to per sons serving in the army or iu mer chant vessels, should be made to include those who serve in tho navy or marine corps. The status of per sons of foreign birth or parentage should be more clearly defined, so as to strengthen the hands of the gov ernment iu protecting its citi.enB abroad. THE 

TREASURY DEPARTMENT. The condition of our fiuauces and the operation of various branches of the public service which are con nected with tho treasury department arc very fully discussed in the report of the secretin y. It appears that the ordinary revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1884, were : From customs, $195,GG7.4S9.7G ; from in ternal revenue, ."fl2l,5SG,072.51 ; from all other sources, $3l,SGG,307.G5; total ordinary revenues, $34S,519,5G9.52. The public expenditures during the same period were : For civil ex penses, .1522.312,907.71 : for foreign in tercourse, $l,2G0,7GG.fi9 ; for Indians, G.475,999.29 ; for pensions, $55,429, 228.3G; for the military establish ment, including river and harbor im provements and arsenals, $39,429,003, 30; for the naval establishment, including vessels, machinery and improvements at navy yards, $17,292, G01.44; for miscellaneous expendi tures, iucluding public buildings, light houses aud collecting the rev enue, $43,939,710 ; for expenditures on account of the District of Columbia, $3,407,049.02; for interest on the public debt, $54,578,378.40; for the sinking fund, $40,790,229 50; total ordinary expenditures, $290,91G,483. 83; leaving a surplus of $57,003,390. 09. As compared with preceding fiscal year, there was a net decrease of over $21,000,000 in the amount of expen ditures. The aggregate receipts were less than those of the year previous by about $54,000,000. The falling off of revenue from customs was nearly $20,000,000 of this deficiency and about $23,000,000 of the remainder was due to the diminished receipts for internal taxation. The secretary estimates the total receipts for the fiscal year, which will end June 30, 1885, at $330,000,000, and the total expenditures at $290,120,201:10, in which are included the interest on the debt and the amount payable to the sinking fund. This would leave a surplus for the entire year of about $39,000,000. THE VALUE OF EXPORTS from the United States to foreign countries during the year ending June 30, 1884, was aB follows : Do mestic merchandise, $724,964,852 ; for eign merchandise, $15,548,758; total merchandise, $740,513,609 ; specie, $67,133,383 ; total exports of merchan dise and specie, $807,04U,yy2. The cotton and cotton manufactures in cluded in this statement were valued at $208,900,415; the breadstuff's at $162,554,715 ; the provisions at $114, 416,547, and the mineral oils at $47, 103,748. During the same period the imports were aB follows: Merchan dise, $667,697,693; gold and silver, $37,426,262; total, $705,123,955. More than 63 per cent, of the entire value of imported merchandise consisted of the following articles: Sugar and molasses, $103,844,274; wool and woolen manufactures, 157,542,292 ; colice, $49,000,7110; iron and steel and manufactures thereof, $41,643,599 ; chemicals, $38,464,965; flax, hemp, jute and like substances and man ufactures thereof, $33,403,398; cotton and manufactures of cotton, $30,454, 476; hides aud skins, other than fur skins, $22,350,906. I concur with the secretary of the treasury In recommending the imme diate SUSPENSION OF COINAGE of silver dollars and the issue ot sil ver certificates. This is a matter to which in former communications I have moro than once invoked the at tention of the national legislature. It appears that auuually for the past six jears there havo been coined, in com pliance with requirements oi the Act of Feb. 2S, 1878, more than twenty five million silver dollars. The num ber outstaudiug is reported by the secretary to be nearly one hundred and eighty-five million, whereof but little more than forty million, or less than 22 per cent are iu actual circula tion. The mere existence of this fact 6cems to me to furnish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal of the statute which has made such fact pos sible, but there arc other and graver considerations that tend in the samo direction. The secretary avows his convictions that unless this coinage and the issuance of silver certificates be suspended, silver is likely at no distant day to become our sole me tallic standard. The commercial dis turbance and the impairment of natioual credit that would be thus occasioned can scarcely be over esti mated. I hope that the secretary's suggestions respecting the withdraw al from circulation of the one-dollar and two-dollar notes will receive your approval. It is likely that a considerable portion of the silver now incumbering tho vaults of the treas ury might thus find its way into the currency. As in his message of "S2, tho presi dent recommends the abolition of all excise taxes excopt those on distilled spirits. GOVERNMENT IIONDS. More than $100,000,000 ot the three per cent bonds have been redeemed the past year. Those outstanding amount to little over $200,000,000, one-fourth of which will bo retired through the operations of the sinking fund during the coming year. How to avert the contraction of the cur rency caused by their retirement is a question of constantly increasing im portance. The President recom mends a bill permitting the issue, by National banks, of notes equal to the face value of deposited bonds. 

INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS. The amouut drawn from the treas ury duriug the fiscal year was $8,228, 703 54, leaving a balance of $3,112, 5S0.G3. DEFENSES. The importance of protecting im portant cities on the seaboard is set forth. $00,000,000 is the estimated cost of proposed defenses, with an immediate appropriation ot one-tenth the sum as a commencement. MOHMONIgM AND POLYGAMY. The report of the Utah Commission will be read with interest. It dis closes the results of recent legUIatiou looking to the prevention aud pun ishment of polygamy in that Terri tory. I still believe that if that abom inable practice, can be suppressed by law, it can only be by the most radi cal legislation consistent with the restraints oi the Constitution. 1 again recommend, therefore, that Congress assume absolute political control of the Territory of Utah, and provide for the appointment ot a commission with such governmental powers as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put into their hands. MORE AP.OUT FOREIGN TRADE. In the course of this communica tion reference has more thau once been made as to the policy of this Government as regards the extension of our foreign trade. It seems proper to declare the general principle that should, in my opinion, underlie our national efibrts in this direction. The main conditions ot the problem may be thus stated : We are a people en gaged iu mechanical pursuits, and fertile in invention. We eover avast extent of territory rich iu agricultural products, and in nearly all the raw materials necessary tor successful manufacture. We have a system of productive establishments more thau sufficient to supply our own demands ; the wages of labor arc nowhere else so great ; the scale of living of our artisans clashes is sucti as tends to secure their personal comfort aud the development of those higher morals aud the intellectual qualities thai go to the making of a good citizen ; our system ot lax and tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in excess ot the present needs of the Govern ment. These are elements from which it is sought to devise a scheme by which, without unfavorably changing the condition of the workiugincu, our merchant marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition aud new mark ets provided for the sale beyond our borders of the manifold fruits of our industrial enterprises. The problem is complex and can be solved by no single measure of innovation or re form. The countries of the American continent and the adjacent islands are for the United States the natural market of supply and demand. It is from that we should obtain what we do not produce in sufficiency, and it is to them that the surplus productions of our fields, our mills and our work shops should flow, under conditions that will equalize or favor them in comparison with foreign competition. 

RECIPROCITY TREATIES. Four paths of policy seem to point to this end : Firr.t, a series of reci procal commercial treaties with the countries of America which shall fos ter between us and them and unham pered movement to trade. Tho con ditions of these treaties should be the free admission of such merchandise as this country does not produce iu re turn for admission free or under a favored scheme of duties of our pro ducts, the benefits of such exchange to apply ou these goods carried under the flags of the parties to the contract ; the removal on both sides from ves sels so privileged of all tonnage dues and national imports, so that their vessels may ply unhindered between our ports, and those of other contract ing parties, though without infringing on the reserved home coasting trade ; the removal or reduction of burdens on the exported products of those countries coining within the benefits of the treaties and the avoidance of the technical restrictions and penal ties bv which our intercourse with those countries is at present ham pered. Secondly, the establishment of the consular service of the United States on a salaried footing permitting the relinquishment of consular fees not only as respects the vessels under the silk and its manufactures, $49,919,128; J national 11-ig, hut nUo a ropecte ves- j-els i t lie inaty nation- carrying goods entitled to the benefits of the treaties. Thirdly, the enactment of mea-urcs to tavor the con-tructiou aud umiutc uauce ot a steam-carrying marine uuder the flag ot the United States. Fourthly, the establishment of a uniform currency basis for the coun tries of America, so that the coined products ot our mines may circulate ou equal terms throughout the whole system ot commouwcalshs This would revive h monetary union ot America whereby ihe output oi the bullion-producing countries and the circulation of those which yield nei ther gold nor silver could be adjusted iu conformity with the population, wealth and commercial needs ot c-ich. As many of the countries luruish no bullion to the common tck, the sur plus production of our rumen aud mints might thus be utilized, and a step taken ioward the general remoii iti.'ition of silver. To Ihe accom plishment of these cuds, so far as can be attained by separate treaties, the negotiations already concluded aud now in progreM have been directed and Ihe favor with which this en larged policy has thus tar been re ceived, warrants the belief that all its operations will ere long embrace all, or ncail) all the countries of this hemisphere. It is by no means desirable, howev er, that the policy uuder confedera tion should bo applied to thoso countries alone. The healthful en largement of our I rade with Kurope, Asia and Africa should besought by reducing t a rill burdens ou such ot their wares as neither wo nor the other American States are fitted to produce, and thus euabliug ourselves to obtain in return a belter market for our .supplies of food, ot raw male rials aud of the manufactures in which we excel. It seems to me that many of the embarrassing element iu the great national conflict between protection and free trade may thus be turned to good account, that the revenue may bo reduced so as no longer to overtax the people, that protective duties may be retained without becoming bur densome, that our shipping interests may be judiciously weighed, the cur rency fixed on linn basis, and above all such annuity of interests estab lished among the states of the Amer ican system, as will be of great aud of ever-increasing advantage to' them all. All treaties iu the line of this policy which have been negotiated, or in process of negotiation, contain a provision deemed to be requisite under the clause of the Constitution limiting to the House of Representa tives tho authority o originate bills for raising revenue. A 

NATIONAL 1SANKRUPT LAW. Iu view of the general and per sistent demand throughout the com mercial community ' for a national baukrnpt law, 1 hope that the dif ferences ot sentiment which have hitherto prevented its enactment may not outla.-t the present sesion. A PENSION TO GEN. GRANT. I recommend that iu recognition ot the eminent services of Ulysses S. Grant, late General of the armies of the United States, and twice Presi dent of the nation, Congress confer upon him a suitable pension. 

MISCELLANEOUS SUGGESTIONS. Certain of the measures that seem to me necessary and expedient I have now, in obedience to the Constitu tion, recommended for your adoption. A respects others ot uo. Ies3 im portance I shall content myself with renewing the recommendations al ready made to the Congress without restating the grounds upon which such recommendations were based. Tho preservation of forests on the public, domain, tl.e granting ot Gov ernment aid for popular education, the amendment of the Federal Con stitution so as to make effective the disapproval, by the President, of par ticular ideas in appropriation bills; the enactment of statutes in regard to the filling of vacancies in Presi dential office, and the determination of vexed questions respecting Presi dential inability, are measures which may justly receive your serious con sideration. 

CONCLUSION. As the time draws nigh when I am to retire from the public service, I can not refraiu from expressing to the members of the Natioual Legislature with whom I have been brought into personal and otlicial intercourse, my sincere appreciation of their unfailing courtesy, aud of their harmonious co-operation with the Executive in so many measures calculated to promote the interests of the nation, aud to my fellow citizens generally I acknowl edge a deep sense of obligation tor the support which (hey have accorded me iu my administration of the Government.

Lozier, tho night clerk of the Railroad hotel at North Platte, Neb., tho other night was found tied and gagged in the dining room and the house robbed of about two hun dred dollars. One Hart was arrested and identified by Lozier as the man who robbed him. Hart at the hear ing proved an alabi and was discharg ed. A warrant was then issued for Lozier, and just before it was served he weut into a room of the hotel an shot himself in the left breast. II died in two hours. It is reported in recent news from London that Mr. Foster passed through London the other day, hav ing signed the commercial treaty of the United States with Spain.

Patten answers the description of Pusey in every particular, but claims it is a case of mistaken identity. Recent Shanghai dispatches say the native press is certain that China will succeed in reconquering Tou- quin. The uninesc tactics seem to be to retire and allow the French to fol low them into the deadly passes of Tonquin, thus weakening their lengthened line. James C.
