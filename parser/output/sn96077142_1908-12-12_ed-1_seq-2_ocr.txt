PRESIDENT TO CONGRESS Message Read to Both Houses of National Assembly LEGISLATION CALLED FOR financial Standing of the Nation Do dared Excellent Control of Cor- , porationa, the President Thinks, Should Be Left to the National Government Labor Leaders Come In for Criticism Respect for Law Vital to the Well-Being of Country. "Washington. The message of Presl elent Roosevelt was read In both houses ef congress Tuesday. In sub stance the document was as follows: Te the Senate and Houm of Represen tatives: The financial tending' of the nation at the present time Is excellent, and the financial management of the na tion's Interests by the government dur-lag- the last seven years has shown the est satisfactory results. But our cur rency system Is Imperfect, and It Is ear neatly to be hoped that the currency commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do way with the existing defects. During the period from July 1, 1901, te September 30, 1908, there was an Increase In the amount of money In circulation of $902,991,399. The Increase In the per capita during this period was $7.06. Within this time there were several occasions when It was necessary for the treasury de partment to come lA the relief of the money market by purchases or redemp tions of United States bonds; by Increas ing deposits In national banks; by stim ulating additional Issues of national bank otes, and by facilitating Importations from abroad of gold. Our Imperfect cur rency system has made these proceedings necessary, and they were effective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of 107 Immensely Increased the difficulty of . ordinary methods of relief. By the mid dle of November the available working balance In the treasury had been reduced te approximately $6,000,O0d. Clearing house associations throughout the coun try had been obliged to resort to the expedient of Issuing clearing house cer tificates, to be used as money. In this emergency It was determined to Invite subscriptions for. $50,00,000 Panama canal bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent, certificates of Indebtedness authorised by the act of June 13. 1898. It was proposed to redeposlt In the national banks the proceeds of these Issues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional circu lating notes of national banks. The moral effect of this procedure was so great that It was necessary to Issue only $24,631 .SS0 of the Panama bonds and $15. 436,600 of the certificates of Indebtedness. During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, the balance between the net ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses of the government showed a surplus in the four years 1902, 1903, 1906, and 1907. and a deficit In the years 1904, 19P5, 1908 and a fractional part ef tr.e fiscal year 1909. The net result was a surplus of $99,283,413.54. The flnan lal operations nf the government during this period, based upon these differences between receipts and expenditures, re sulted In a net reduction of the interest bearing debt of the United States from $987,141,040 to $S97,2f3,990, notwithstanding that there had been two sales of Panama canal bonds amounting In the aggregate to $04,631,980, and an Issue of three per oent certificates of indebtedness under the act of June 13, 1898, amounting to $15,436,600. Refunding operations of the treasury department under the act of March 14, 1900, resulted in the conver sion Into two per cent, consols of 1930 of $200,309,400 bonds bearing lilfther rates of Interest. A decrease of $8,687,966 In the annual Interest charge resulted from these operations. In short, during the seven years and three months there has been a net sur plus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, a reduction of the Interest-bearing debt by ninety millions, in spite of the extraordinary ex pense of the Panama canal, and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual Interest charge. Control of Corporations. As regards the great corporations en caged In Interstate business, and espe cially the railroads, I can only repeat -what I have already again and again said In my messages to the confess. I be Here that under the Interstate clause of the constitution the United States has complete and paramount right to con tret all agencies of Interstate commerce, and I believe that the national govern ment alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure Justice from, and to do Justice to, the great corporations which are the meet Important factors In modern busi ness. I believe that It Is worse than folly to attempt te prohibit all com binations as Is done by the Sherman anti-trust law, because such a law can be enforced only Imperfectly and un equally, and Its enforcement works al most as much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that Instead of an un wise effort to prohibit all combinations, there shall be substituted a law which hall expressly permit combinations which are in the Interest of the public, but shall at the same time give to some Agency In the national government full power of control and supervision over them. One of the chief features of this ontrol should ' be securing entire pub licity In all matters which the public has a right to know, and furthermore, the power, not by Judicial but by execu tive action, to prevent or put a atop to very form of Improper favoritism or other wrongdoing. The railways of the country should be put completely under the Interstate com merce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. The power of the commission should be made thoroughgoing, eo that It could exercise complete supervision and control over the Issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should be eummary. . . . Rates must be made as low as la compatible with giving prop er returns to all the employee of the rail road, from the highest to the lowest, and proper return? to the shareholders, but they must not. for Instance, be re duced In such fashion aa to necessitate a cut In the wages of the employee or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits of honest shareholders. Telegraph and telephone companies en caged In Interstate business should be put under the Jurisdiction of the Inter state commerce commission. Iti la very earnestly to be wished that our people, through their representatives, should act In this matter. It le to the Interest of all of 'us that there ehould be a premium put upon In dividual initiative, and Individual ca pacity, and aa ample reward for the great directing Intelligence alone com petent to manage the great buslneee op erations or to-day. It Is well to keep In mind that exactly aa the anarchist la the worst enemy of liberty and the reaction ary the worst enemy of ' order, eo the men who defend the rights of property have most to fear from the wrongdoers ef great wealth, and the men who are championing popular lights have most to fear from the demagogues who In the name of popular rights would do wrong to and oppress honest business men, honest men of wealth; for the success of either type of wrongdoer necessarily In vites a violent reaction against the cauee the wrongdoer nominally upholds. . , Need of Centralization. The proposal to make the na tional government eupreme over, and therefore to give It complete control over. the railroads and other Instruments of Interstate commerce ie merely a propos al to carry out to the letter one ef the prime purposes, If not the prime purpose, for which the constitution was founded. It does not represent centralisation. It represents merely the acknowledgment of the patent fact that centralisation haa already come In business. If this Irre sponsible outside business power Is te be controlled In the Intereet of the general public It can only be controlled In one way; by giving adequate power of con' trol to the one sovereignty capable of ex erclslng auch power the national govern ment. To abandon the effort for national control means to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to render like ly continual bursts of action by atate leg islatures, which cannet achieve the pur pose sought for, but whloh can do a great deal of damage to the corporation without conferring any real benefit oa tne public. There ahould be regulation by the na tional government of the great Interstate corporatlens. Including a simple method of account keeping, publicity, supervision of the Issue of securities, abolition of rebates and of special privileges. There ehould be short-time franchisee for all corporations engaged In public business: Including the corporations which get power from water rlghta. There should be national aa well as state guardianship er mines and rorests. The labor legisla tion hereinafter referred to ahould con currently be enacted Into law. To accomplish this, means a certain In crease In the use of not the creation of power, by the central government. The power already exists; It doee not have to be created; the only question Is whether It shall be used or left idle and meanwhile the corporatlona over which the power ought to be exercised will not remain Idle. The danger to Amer ican democracy lies not In the least In the concentration of administrative power In responsible and accountable hands. It lies In having the power Insufficiently concentrated, so that no one can be held responsible to the people for Its use. Concentrated power ie palpable, visible, responsible, easily reached, quickly held to account . Democracy Is In peril wherever the administration of po litical power la ecattered among a variety of men who work In secret, whose very . namee t are un known to the common people. It Is not In peril from any man who derives au thority from the people, who exercises It In sight of the people, and who Is from time to time compelled to give an account of Its exercise to the people. Legislation for Wageworker. There are many matters affecting labor and the statue of the wageworker to which I ehould like to draw your atten tion, but an exhaustive discussion of the problem In all Its aspects Is not now nec essary. I believe In a steady ef fort, or perhaps It would be more accurate to say In steady efforts In many different directions, to bring about a condition of affairs under which the men who work with hand or with brain, the laborers, the superintendents, the men who produce the market and the men who find a market for the articles produced, shall own a far greater share than at present of the wealth they pro duce, and be enabled to Invest It In the tools and Instruments by which all work la carried on. As far as possible I hope to see a frank recognition of the advan tages conferred by machinery, organisa tion and division of labor, accompanied by an effort to bring about a larger ahare In the ownership by wage-worker of rail way, mill and factory. Postal Savings banks will make It easy for the poorest to keep their sav ings in absolute safety. The regulation of the national highways must be such that they shall serve all people with equal Justice. Corporate finances must be supervised so as to make It far safer than at present for the man of small means to Invest his money In etocks. There must be prohibition of child la bor, u.tnlnutlon of women labor, short ening of hours of all mechanical labor; stock waterinc should be prohibited, and stock gambling so far as la possi ble discouraged. There should be a progressive Inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial education should be encouraged. Ae far as possible we sheuld lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium upon thrift, hard work, and business energy; but these quaJltlee cease to be the main factore In aocu mulatlnc a fortune lone before that fortune reachee a point where It would be seriously affected by any Inheri tance tax auch as I propose. It Is emi nently right that the nation ahould fix the terme upon which the great for tunes are Inherited. They rarely do good and they often do harm to those who Inherit them In their entirety. There ahould no longer be any palter Inc with the question of taklnc care of the wageworkera who, under our pres ent Industrial aystem, become killed, crippled, or worn out as part of the regular Incidents of a given busi ness. As far aa concerns those who have been worn out, I call your attention to the fact that definite steps toward providing old-ace pen sions have been taken In many of our private Industries. These may be In definitely extended through voluntary association and contributory achemee. or through the agency of savings banks, aa under the Massachusetts plan. 1 Urgent Need ef Reform. Our present system, or rather no sys. tern, works dreadful wrong, and Is of benefit to only one class of people the lawyers. When a workman Is Injured what he needs Is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the certainty of relief through Immediate administra tive action. No academic theory about "freedom of contract" or "consti tutional liberty to contract" should be permitted to Interfere with thle and similar movements. Pending a thoroughgoing Investiga tion and action there le certain legis lation which ahould be enacted at onoe. The law, passed at the laat session ef the congress .granting compensation to certain classes of employee of the gov ernment .should be extended to Include all employee of the government and ahould be made more liberal In Ita terme. There le no good ground for the distinction made In the law be tween those engaged In hesardous oc cupations and those not so en gaged. The terms ef the act pro viding compensation should ,be made mere liberal than' In the present act. A year'a compensation Is not ade quate for a wage-earner's family In the event of hie death by accident In the couree of hla employment And In the event of death occurring. Say. ten' or eleven montha after the accident the family would only receive aa compen sation the equivalent of one r two months' earnings. In this respect the Cnroslty of the United States towards Ita employes compares most unfavora bly with that of every country In Eu ropeeven the poorest I renew my recommendation made In a prevloue message that half-holidays be granted during aummer to all wage workers In government employ . I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour day should aa rapidly and ae far ae practi cable be extended to the entire work being carried on by the government; the present law should be amended to embrace contracta on those publlo worka which the present wordlnc of the act eeems to exclude. Would De utile Salaries' of Judges. X most earnestly urge upon the con gress the duty of Incrsaslnc the totally Inadequate salaries now given to our Judges. On the whole there Is no body of publlo servants who do aa valuable work, nor whose moneyed reward Is so Inadequate compared to their work. Be ginning with the supreme court the Judgee ehould have their salaries dou bled. It ie not befitting the dignity of the nation that Its most honored publlo eervants should be paid auma ao email compared to what they would earn In private life that the performance of publlo service by them implies an ex ceedingly heavy peountary sacrifice. . It Is earnestly to be deelred that aomo method should be devised for dotnc away with the lone delaya which now obtain In the administration of Justice, and which operate with peculiar sever ity against persons of email meana, and favor only the very criminals whom It Is moat desirable to punish. Theae lone delays In the final decisions of cases make In the aggregate a-crying evil; and a remedy ehouiJ be devised. Much of this Intolerable delay la due to Improper regard paid to technicali ties which are a mere htnderance to Justice. In some noted recent cases this over-regard for technicalities has re sulted In a striking denial of Justice, and flagrant wrong to the body politic. Labor Leadera Crltlcleed. At the last election certain leaders of organised labor made a 'violent and sweeping attack upon the entire Judi ciary of the country, an attack couched In auch terms as to Include the most upright honest and broad-minded Judges, no less than those of narrower mind and more restricted outlook. Last , year, before the house com mittee' on Judiciary, these eame labor leaders formulated their de mands, specifying the bill that contained them, refusing all compro mise, stating they wished the principle of that bill or nothing. They Insisted on a provision that In a labor dispute no Injunction ahould Issue except to protect a property right and specifical ly provided that the right to carry on business should not be construed as a property right; and In a second provis ion their bill made legal In a labor dis pute any act or agreement by or be tween two or more persons that would not have been unlawful If done by a single person. In other words, this bill legalised blacklisting and boycotting In every form, legalising, for Instance, those forme of the secondary boycott which the anthracite coal strike com mission so unreservedly condemned; while the right to carry on a business waa explicitly taken out from under that protection which the law throws over property. The demand was made that there should be trial by Jury In contempt cases, thereby most seriously Impairing the authority of the courts. All this represented a course of policy which. If carried out would mean the enthronement of class privilege In Ite crudest and most brutal form, and the destruction of one of the most essen tial functions of the Juditcary In all civ ilised lands. The violence of the crusade for this legislation, and Its complete failure. Illustrate two truths which it Is essen tial our people should learn. In the first place, they ought to teach the workingman, the laborer, the wage worker, that by demanding what Is Im proper and Impossible he plays Into the hands of his foes. Such a crude and vicious attack upon the courts, even If It were temporarily successful, would inevitably in the end cause a . violent reaction and would band the great mass of cltlxens together, forcing1 them to stand by all the Judges, competent and incompetent alike, rather than to see the wheels of Justice stopped. The wageworkera, the workingmen, the laboring men of the country by the way in which they repudiated the ef fort to get them to cast their votes in response to an appeal to class hatred, have emphasised their sound patriotism and Americanism.-- Such an attitude le an object lesson in good cltisenshlp to the entire nation. Judicial 8ystem Sound. Our Judicial system Is sound and effective at core, and It remains, and must ever be maintained, as the safeguard of those principles of lib erty and Justice which 'stand at the foundation of American Institutions; for, as Burke finely said, when liberty and Justice are separated, neither Is safe. There are, however, some members of the Judicial body who have lagged be hind In their understanding of these great and vital changes In the body politic, whoee minds have never been epened te the new applications of the old principles made necessary by the new conditions. Judgee of thle etamp do last ing harm by their decisions, because they oenvlnce poor men In need ef protection that the courts of the land are pro foundly Ignorant ef and out of sympathy with their needs, and profoundly Ignorant or hostile te any proposed remedy. To such men It seems a cruel mockery to have any court decide against them on the greund that it desires to preserve "liberty" in a purely technical form, by withholding liberty In any real and con atructlve sense. There are certain decisions by various courts which have been exceedingly det rimental te the rights ef wage-workers. This Is true ef all decisions that decide that men are, by, the constitution, "guar anteed their liberty" to contract to enter a dangerous occupation, or to work an undesirable or Improper number of hours, or to work In unhealthy surroundings; and therefore cannot recover damagee when maimed In that occupation, and cannot be forbidden to work what the legislature decides le an excessive num ber of hours, or to carry on the work under conditions which the legislature decides to . be unhealthy. Decisions such as those nullify the legislative effort to protect the wage-workers who most need protection from those employ ers who take advantage of their grind ing need. They halt er hamper the move ment for securing better and more equi table conditions of labor. There la also, I think, ground for the belief that substantial Injustice la often suffered by employes In consequence ef the custom ef courts Issuing temporary Injunctions without notice to them, and punishing them fer contempt of court In Instances where, aa a matter of fact they have no knowledge of any proceed ings. Organised labor la chafing under the unjust restraint which cornea from repeated resort to twe plan of . procedure. Ita discontent haa been unwisely expressed. . and often Improperly expressed, ' but ' there Is a aound basis for . It, and the or derly and law-abiding people of a com munity would be In a far stronger posi tion for upholding the courts If the un doubtedly existing, abuses could be pro vided againet ; Injunction Must Remain. - . The nower of Iniunctlon is a rreat equitable remedy, which should on no ' account be destroyed. But safeguards should' be erected acalnst Ita abuse. In substance, provision . should be made that no Injunction or temporary re straining order issue otherwise than on notice, except where Irreparable Injury would otherwise result; and In such case a hearing on the merits of the order ahould be had within a short fixed pe riod, .and. If not then continued after hearing, it ahould forthwith lapse. De cisions should be rendered immediately, and the chance of delay minimised la every way. Moreover, I. believe' that the procedure ahould be sharply defined, and the Judge required minutely to etate the particulars both of hla action and of hla reasons therefor, eo that the congress can If It desires examine and Investigate the same. For many . of the shortcomings of Justice in our country our people as a whole are themselves to blame, and the Judges and Jurlea merely bear their ahare together with the publlo as a whole. It is discreditable to ua aa a people that there should be difficulty In convlctlnc murderers, or In bringing to Justice men who as publlo servanta have been guilty of corruption, or who have profited by the corruption of publlo servants. The reeult Is equally unfortunate, whether due to hairsplit ting technicalities In the Interpretation of law by Judgee. to sentimentality and olass consciousness on the part of Jurlea. or to hyaterla and sensational ism In the dally press. For much ef this failure of Justice no responsibility whatever Ilea on rich men aa auch. We who make up the mass of the people cannot shift the responsibility from our own eheuldere. But there la an Impor tant part of the failure which haa spe cially to do with inability to hold to proper account men of wealth who behave badly. The Modern Corporation. The huge wealth that haa been accu mulated by a few individuals of recent years, in what haa amounted to a so cial and industrial revolution, has been aa recards seme of theee Individuals made possible only by the Improper use of the modern corporation. A certain type of modern corporation, with its officers and agents, Ita many Issues of securities, and its constant consolida tion with allied undertakings, finally becomes an instrument so complex as to contain a greater number of ele ments that, under various Judicial de cisions, lend themselves to fraud and oppression than any device yet evolved In the human brain. Corporatlona are necessary Instruments of modern busi ness. They have been permitted to become a menace largely because the governmental representatives of the people have worked slowly in provid ing for adequate control over them. Our , great clusters of corpora tions, huge trusts and fabulously wealthy multimillionaires,' employ the very best lawyers they can obtain to pick flaws In statutes after their passage; but they also employ a class of secret agents who seek, under the advice of experts, to render hostile legislation Innocuous by making It un constitutional, often through the Inser tion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping provisions against the Interests of the parties inspiring them; while the demagogues, the cor rupt creatures who - Introduce black mailing schemes to "strike" corpora tions, and all who demand extreme,. and undesirably radical, measures, show themselves to be the worst ene mies of the very publlo whose loud mouthed champlona they profess to be. Real damage haa been done by the manifold and conflicting interpretations ol the interstate commerce law. Con trol over the great corporations doing Interstate business can be effective only If It Is vested with full power In an administrative department a branch of the federal executive, carrying out a federal law; It can never be effective If a divided responsibility Is left In both the states and the nation; It can never be effective if left in the hands of the courts to be decided by lawsuits. ' Respect for Law Must Bo Upheld. The courts hold a place of peculiar and deserved sanctity under our form of gov ernment. Respect for the law Is essen tial to the permanence of our Institu tions; and respect for the law Is largely conditioned upon respect for the courts. It Is an offense against the republic to say anything which can weaken this re spect, save for the gravest reason and In the most carefully guarded manner. In no other nation In the world do the courts wield such vast and far-reaching power as In the United States. All that Is nec essary is that the courte as a whole should exercise this power with the far sighted wisdom already shown by those Judges who scan the future while they act in the present Let them exerclae thle great power not only honestly and bravely, but with wise Insight Into the needs and fixed purposes of the people, so that they may do Justice, and work equity, so that they may protect all per sons In their rights, and yet break down the barriers of privilege, which Is the foe of right ) Forest Preservation. If there la any one duty which more than another we ewe It te our children to perform at once, It le te eave the for ests of this country, fer they constitute the first and most Important element In the conservation ef the natural re sources of the country. . . . Just aa a farmer, after all hla Ufa making hie living from hie farm, will. If he ia an ex pert farmer, leave It as aa asset ef in creased value te hla aen, ao we ehould leave our national domain to our chil dren, Increased In value and not worn out There are email sections of our own country. In the east and In the west in the Adlrondacka, the White mountains and the Appalachians, and In the Reeky mountains, where we can already eee for ourselves the damage In the shape of permanent Injury to the Mil end the river systems which comes from reckless deforestation. It matters not whether this deforestation le due to the actual reckless rutting ef timber, to the Area that Inevitably follow auch reckless cut ting of timber, or to reckless and uncon trolled erasing, especially by the great migratory bands of sheep, the un checked wandering of which over the country meana destruction to forests and disaster to the email home-makers, the settlers of limited means. Thanka to our own recklessness tn the use of our splendid forests, we have already crossed the verge of a timber famine In thle country, and no measures that we now take can, at least for many years, undo the mischief that has already been done. But we can pre vent further mischief being done; and It would be In the highest degree reprehen sible to let any consideration of tem porary convenience or temporary coat Interfere with such action, especially as regards the national forests which the nation can now, at this very moment control. The lesson of deforestation In China la a lesson which mankind ahould have learned many tlmee already from what haa occurred In other placea. Denuda tion leaves naked eoll; then gullylne cuts down to the bare rock; and mean while the rock-waste burlee the bottom lands. When the eoll le cone, men muet eo; and the process does not take lone. Plea for Inland Waterway. Action ehould be begun forthwith, dur ing the present session of the congress, for the Improvement of our Inland water waysaction which will result In. giving us not only navigable but navigated rivers. Until the work of river Improvement Is undertaken In a modern way It can not have results (hat will meet the needs of this modern - nation. The plan which promises the beet and quick- eet results Is that of a per manent commission authorised to co-ordinate the -work of all the government departments relating to waterways, and to frame and supervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. Under such a commission the actual work of construc tion might be entrusted to the reclama tion eervtce; or to the military engineers acting with a sufficient number of civili ans to continue the work in time of war; or it might be divided between the rec lamation service and the corps of en gineers. Funds should be provided from jurrent revenues if It Is deemed wise nherwise from the sale of bonds. The essential thing Is that the work should go forward under the best possible plan, and with the least possible delay. The time for playing with our waterways is past The country demands results. The president urgeg that national parks adjacent to national forests be placed under the control of the forest service of the agricultural depart ment; he also points out the benefits derived from pure food legislation. The message continues: Needs of the 8ecret Service. Last year an amendment waa Incor porated In the measure providing for the secret service, which provided that there should be no detail from the secret serv ice and ao transfer therefrom. The amendment In question was of benefit to no one excepting to criminals, and It aerlously hampers the government In the detection of crime and the securing of Justice. The chief argument In favor of the provision was that the congressmen did net them selves wish to be Investigated by the secret service men. Very little of such Investigation haa been done In the past; but It Is true that the work of the secret service agents was partly responsible for the Indictment and conviction of a sen ator and a congressman for land frauds in Oregon. . I do not believe that It la in the publlo Interest to protect Criminals In any branch of the public service, and exactly as wo have again and again dur ing the past seven years prosecuted and convicted 'such criminals who were in the executive branch of the government so In my belief we should be given ample means to prosecute them If found In the legislative branch. But If this Is not considered desirable a special exception could be made In the law prohibiting the use of the secret service force In inves tigating members of the congress. Postal Savings Banks. I again renew my recommendation for postal savings banks, for deposit ing savings with the security of the covernment behind them. The object Is to encourage thrift and economy In the wage-earner and person of mod erate means. It is believed that In the aggregate vast sums of money would be brought Into circulation through the In strumentality of the postal savings banks. Parcel Post In my last annual message I com mended the ' postmaster-general's recommendation for an extension of the parcel post on the rural routes. The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routee would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and the country storekeeper, and it Is desirable that the routes, serving more than 15.000.000 people, ehould be utilised to the fullest practicable extent. Education. With the limited means hitherto pro vided, the bureau of e ducatlon has rendered efficient service, but the con gress has neglected to adequately sup ply the bureau with meana to meet the educational growth of the country. I earnestly recommend that this un fortunate state of affairs as regards the national educational office be reme died by adequate appropriations. This recommendation is urged by the repre sentatives of our common schools and great state universities and the leading; educators, who all unite in requesting favorable consideration and action by the congress upon this subject The president points out the neces sity of better organization of the vari ous bureaus responsible for the public health, and urges the placing of all soldiers' homes under the jurisdiction of the war department. Statehood. On the question of statehood the president says: I advocate the Immediate admission of New Mexico and Arlxona as states. This should be done at the present session of the congress. The people of the two ter ritories have made It evident by their votee that they will not come In as one state. The only alternative la to admit them aa two, and I trust that this will be done without delay. Interstate Fisheries. . , I call the attention of. the congress to the Importance of the problem of the fisheries In the Interstate waters. On the Great Lakes we are now, under the very wise treaty of April 11 of this year,' en deavoring to come te an International agreement for the preservation and sat isfactory use of the fisheries of these wa ters which ean not otherwise be achieved. Lake Brie, for example, haa the richest fresh water fisheries in the world; but It Is new controlled by the statutes of two nations, four statee, and one province, and this province by two different ordi nances In different counties. All these political divisions work at cross pur poses, and In no oase can they achieve protection to the fisheries, on the one hand, and Justice to the localities and In dividuals on the other. Foreign Affaire. This nation's foreign policy Is based on the theory that right muet be done between natlona precisely ae between individuals, and In, our actions for the last ten years we have In this matter proven eur faith by our deeds. We have behaved, and are behaving, to wards ether natlona, ae In private life an honorable man would behave to wards his fellows. Latin-American Republics. The commercial and material prog ress of the SO Latin-American republics le worthy of the careful attention nf the congrees. The International Bureau of the American Republics Is doing a useful work In making these natlona and their resources better known to us. and In acquainting them' not only with us as a people and with our pur poses towarda them, but with what we have to exchange for their goods. ' Panama Canal. The work on the Panama canal Is be ing done with a speed, efficiency and entire devotion to duty, which make It a model for all work of the kind. The! men on the Isthmus, from Col. OoethairT and hla fellow commissioners through the entire list of employee who are faithfully doing their duty, have won their right to the ungrudging respect and eratitude of the American people. Ocean Mall Lines. X again recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1891 ao that satis factory American ocean mall lines to South America. Asia, the Philippines, and Australasia may be established. . Hawaii. I call particular attention to the Ter ritory of Hawaii. The Importance of those Islands Is apparent and the need of Improving their condition and de veloping their resource Is urgent The Philippines. Real progress toward Self-government (s being made la the Philippine Islands. 1 trust "that within a 'generation the time will arrive when the Philippines oaa. decide for themselves whether It la well for them to become Independent, er! to continue under . the protection of a. strong and disinterested power, able to guarantee to the islande order at home and protection from foretgaTnvaslon. i ' Porto Rico. ?v I again recommend that American clt isenshlp be conferred upon the people of Porto Blco. ; - Cuba. ! ' In Cuba our occupancy will cease la about two months' time; the Cubans have In orderly manner elected their own governmental authorities, and the Island will be turned over to them. Our occu pation on this occasion has lasted a lit tle over two years, and Ciibe haa thriv en and prospered under it Our earnest hope and one desire Is that the people of the island shall now govern them selves with Justice, so that peace and or der may be secure. , Japanese Exposition. The Japanese covernment has post poned until 1917 the date of the great international exposition, the action be ing taken so as to insure ample time in which to prepare to make the expo sition all that it ahould be made. The American commissioners have visited Japan and the postponement will mere ly give ampler opportunity for Ameri ca to be represented at the exposition. Not since the first international expo altion has there been one of greater Importance than thle will be, marking, aa It does, the fiftieth anniversary of the ascension to the throne of the em peror of Japan. The extraordinary leap to the foremost place among the nations of the world made by Japan during thle half century Is something unparalleled In all previous history. I take this opportunity publicly to state my appreciation of the way In which In Japan, In Australia, In New Zealand, and In all the states of South America, the battle fleet haa been re ceived on Its practice voyage around the world. The American government can not too strongly express Its appre ciation of the abounding and generous hospitality shown 'our ships In every port they visited. The Army. As regards the army I call attention to the fact that while our Junior offi cers and enlisted men stand very high, the present system of promotion by seniority results In bringing Into the higher gradee many men of mediocre capacity who have but a short time to serve. No man should regard It as his vested right to rise to the highest rank In the army any more than In any other profession. It la a curious and by no meana creditable fact that there ehould be so often a failure on the part of the public and its representa tives to understand the great need, from the standpoint ef the service and the nation, of refusing to promote re spectable, elderly Incompetents. The higher places should be given to the most deserving men without regard to seniority; at least seniority should be treated as only one consideration. In the stress of modern industrial com petition no business firm could succeed If those responsible for ite management were chosen simply on the ground that they were the oldest people In Its em ployment; yet this le the course advo cated as regards the army, and re quired by law for all grades except those of general officer. Aa a matter of fact all of the best officers in the highest ranks of the army are those who have attained their present posi tion wholly or in part by a process of selection. The scope of retiring boards should be extended so that they could con sider general unfitness to command for any cause, in order to secure a far more rigid enforcement than at present In the elimination of officers for mental, physical or temperamental disabilities. But this plan la recommended only If the congress doee not ece fit to provide what in my Judgment ia far better. that Is, for selection in promotion, and for elimination for age. Officers who fail to attain a certain rank by a cer tain age, should be retired for in stance, if a man should not attain field rank by the time he te 45 he should of course be placed on the re tired list General officers should be selected as at present and one-third of the other promotions should be made by selection, the selection to be made by the president or secretary of war from a list of at least two candi dates proposed for each vacancy by a board of officers from the arm of the service from which the promotion la to be made. A bill is now before the congress having for its object to se cure the promotion of officers to vari ous gradse at reasonable ages through a process of selection, by boards of of ficers, of the least efficient for retire ment with a percentage of their pay depending upon length of service. The bill, although) not accomplishing all that should 'be1 done. Is a long step In the right direction; and I earnestly recommend Ite passage, or that of a more completely effective measure. National Guard. Now that the organised militia, the National Guard, haa been incorporated with the army aa a part of the national forcee. It behoevee the government to do every reasonable thing in its power to perfect Ite efficiency. It should bo assisted In its instruction and other wise aided more liberally than hereto fore. The continuous servlcee of many well-trained regular offloera will be essential In this connection. A bill te now pending before the congress creatine a number of extra officers In the army, which if passed, as it ought to be. will enable more officers to be trained aa Instructors of National Guard and assigned to that duty. In case of war 1 will be of the utmoet Importance to have a large number ef trained officers to uee fer turning raw levlae Into good troopa. The Navy. I approve the recommendatlona of the general board for the In crease of the navy, calling 'especial attention to the need of addi tional destroyers and colliers, and above all, of the four battleships. It Is desir able to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight battleships of the best existing type. I most earnestly recommend that the general board be by law turned into a general staff. There le literally no ex cuse whatever for continuing the pres ent bureau organisation of the navy. The navy should be treated as a purely mili tary organisation, and everything ehould be subordinated to the one object of se curing military efficiency. A system of promotion by merit either by selec tion or by exclusion, or by both processes, should be Introduced. It is out of the question. If the present principle of promotion by mere seniority Is kept, to expect to get the best results from the higher officers. Our men come too old. and stay for too abort a time. In the high command positions. Nothing better for the navy from every standpoint has ever occurred than the cruise of the battle fleet around the world. The Improvement of the ships In every way haa been extraordinary, and they have gained far more experience In battle tactics than they would have gained If they had stayed In the AtlantlO waters. The American people have cause for profound gratification, both la view of the excellent condition of the fleet as shown by this cruise, and In view of the Improvement the cruise has worked la this already high condition. I do- not believe that there le any other service la the world In which the average of char acter and efficiency la the enlisted men le as high as Is now the case In our own.
