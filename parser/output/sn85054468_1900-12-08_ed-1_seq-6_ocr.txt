The Army Keorjrnnlzatlon Bill A much more measure In prin ciple and In some of its details than the Arms- hill which was passed by the House of Representatives Thursday it would he Impossible to conceive We have already recorded the opinion of this Journal In regard to the unusual and dangerous power the measure gives to the Presi dent In the matter of increasing the army at any time from its minimum to any force he may wish up to the maximum Such power never should be vested in any single man in a free country In the United States at least it is part of the war making power of Congress and its eurrender b the legislative to the exec utive branch of the Government is in vio lation of the spirit If not the letter of the Constitution It is a long step in the direction of imperialism but as to that It Is quite plain that Republican legislators arc indifferent Not long ago the President took it upon himself to engage in and prosecute a for eign war without reference to Congress and In so doing we have no less an au thority than the Hon George P Ed munds for saying that he violated the Constitution Perhaps Republican Sena tors and Representatives argue that as the war power rights of Congress will not be respected in any event they might as well be turned over to the White House and ao cave talk In the future The army canteen an institution which las done a noble missionary work for the ervlce and greatly contributed to tem perance good order and discipline within It has been sacrificed on the altar of poiance andfanatiriim B thtTarnii It is to be hoped that the Sen ate may refute tc ratify such a hypocriti cal and altogether unworthy action The people who have been warring upon the canteen system whatever they may pre tend are the enemies of temperance They cannot and Inon they cannot tear down the canteen without thereby building up the vile whisky dive just outside She Gov ernment reservation They know- that to detroy the cante n would make pay day at every army post a terror to officers and fill the guardhout es with misdemeanants almost unknown to them now Such legislation is vicious also In that It treats the enlisted man as a slave and unentitled to the ordinary civil rights of other people The assumption that he cause a man has put a national uniform on he must be made to eonform not only to the articles of war but to the by law of the Womans Christian Temper ance Union as well is simply outrageous Prohibitionists lo not care for that ap parently in not tare how much drunken neb and disorder their demands may en tail It is not temrerance ther arc working for but conformity to their ideas As these saintly people are up in Maine they are all perfectly satisfied to see a jug of rum under every three legged stool In the comniunilj as long as there is a prohibition law in the Revised Statutes The provision intended to make a way for the retirement of three hundred pounds cf fIck flesh In the person of Shatter as a major general was killed Even the com panion clause which would enable Brig Gens Kitihugh Lee and Wilton to retire as regular brigadiers could not save it end both went by the board It is sonie whst of a commentary upon the alleged ervlces rf Shatter in the Spanish war that lie was considered too large a dose to be swallowed even by Mr Bannas Congress ional automata However there Is small doubt that th great commander who wins tattles from afar off with a hammock and s chunk of Ice will be vindicated in the Eecate where the Army bill now waits Its turn at the oven There is one ground jor saueiaeiion In the connection The measure is to bad that there is lifrle dan ger of its being made any worse before it reaches the Executive Mansion The Ilaj Iauncrfotr Trent- Again the Senate struggled -with the Haj Paunccfotc Treaty in executive ses sion yesterday If we are not misin formed Senator Lodge has executed a Toltc face and la now a champion cf the orictoal treaty Just as It was written In Downing Street He is represented as arguing that were the treaty ratified with the Davis amendment Great Britain would be right in rejecting It as It certainly would be offensive to that Power We do not In the least doubt the accu mcy of Mr Lodges statement as to the ffenslvencss of an amended Treaty but the assertion that Eng land would be right In rejecting it on that account Is quite another question Bow for example could England justify tercel In refusing to accept a provision Identical with the one the insisted upon embodying In the Suez Canal Convention tor her own benefit Our British friends have a shrewd and convenient way of Wave howling for equity where they are conacrncd and stoutly refusing it to there Senator Baton perhaps was right la Vrarnlng his colleagues that ratification of the agreement concocted by Lord Salis bury and his expert assistants would cer tainly lead to war between the countries t tome future time but we do not think 0 The Hay Pauncetote Treaty onoc the canal was built would give the British Government such a mllltnry advantage over us that we cannot conceive how our best business Intel esls would ever t on sent to the slightest offence to that Power On the other hand If the Senate had the patriotism and courage to rejeit the treaty in toto and warn England that wc arc not bound by the violated Clavton Buivver Treaty and will not tolerate Eu ropean interference in Ameiican affairs that action might be a real casus belli and worth talking about There ore ample reasons for believing that the casus would be Ignored after a short season of growling and bluster Great Britain Is in no condition to en gage in war with us It may be granted that the British navy could iuflict great damage upon our coasts but before that game had gone on long our fast cruisers would be wiping the British flag from the ocean while British mills would be Idle for want of our cotton and British mouths hungry for our flour and meat Tho Hay Faunccfoto Treaty is an evi dence either of the corruption that the Clayton Bulwer Treaty reeked with or of a national degeneracy which the fathers of the Republic could never have believed possible in ten thousand years of national life Like the surrender to England of the Torcupine district in Alaska it is a practical acknowledgment of cowardice if not actually of vassalage and It is time to call a halt The Hay Pauncefote Treaty Is an evil thing and will re main so though it be plastered with amendments from stem to stern It may be sweetened a little by a clause de claring our purpose to fortify and protect the Nicaragua Canal and to consider and treat it as an integral part of our coast line but if that be done where is the use of the treaty at all It would be better it scorns to us to pass the hill and stop right there II ri II sli Atrocities In South Afrlt n Hereafter it will be Impossible for our British cousins to find fault with criti cism here or in Europe of their Wej leresque and Armenian atrocities In South Africa Leaders of public opinion In their own Parliament men like Lord Rosebery and Sir Henr Campbell Banncrman de nounced the Kitchener policy Thursday in language than any foreign critic has jet used We may now appeal to the declarations of British public men to Justify us in pointing the finger of scorn at a Govern ment which disregards the commonest in stincts of humanity in waging a war of outrage arson and starvation upon the wives daughters mothers and sisters of gallant enemies It was perhaps a shrewd subterfuge that Mr Balfour Government leader in the Commons resorted to when he showed that the burning of farms and the destruc tion of crops utensils and furniture and the lifting of cattle swice and fowls was entirely sanctified by the United States regulations for soldiers In guerrilla warfare published In 1S99 Possibly the point was well taken as far as our Gov ernment and its supporters are en titled to offer objection to methods they have embodied In our military system But the public opinion of the world will hardly acquit Great Britain of inhumanity be cause its course is officially sanctioned by our War Department In this connection we must Insist that a nlstinrllon 1 in he mart between the State and its people Wc do not believe that a majority of the Inhabitants of the United Kingdom are in favor of the Tur kish war practices of Kitchener any more than are the citizens of this country Gov ernments may ignore condone or even perpetrate crimes which the people under them regard with helpless rage and hor ror So it was with us in 1S97 when the McKlnley Administration was In open part nership with Spain in crushing out liberty in Cuba when our navy was used to as sist Wejler in his hellish war upon virtue and innocence Then we had presented to rs the spectacle of a Spanish Legation which In the cynical words of Dupuy de Lome did not spend thirty thousand dol lars a month In Washington for nothing on one side and tho masses of the nation nlmost ready to revolt against executive authority open to the suspicion of In fluence from Madrid All men know what happened In conse quence The Maine was destroyed in Ha vana Harbor through Spanish official treachery That was the straw that broke the back of the camel of popular patience The Administration no longer dared defy the lightning of national wrath and unwillingly grudgingly and with no heart in the business bent Its head to the storm and went to war In a like way wo are Inclined to think that the cold blooded berserker policy of Lord Sal isbury will one day rnelt before the fire of national and International Indignation The day is past when any Government no matter how strong or great can safely defy the conscience of all mankind This may be considered as especially true of a powerful State like Great Britain brought to a condition of shame humiliation and ruined military prestige by the machinations of a clique of politi cal adventurers led by the worst repre sentative of that type In all England by Chamberlain the captain of Industry whose Manchester corporation In the past has made millions by furnishing arms and munitions of war to the Boers and to the Chinese but who has been equally prudent in allving himself with Cecil Rhodes and the noble company of South African land and mine grabbers against the people to whose offensive and defensive strength he has so greatly con tributed on the side The Transvaal and Orange Free State markets for arms and war material have been closed out The Chamberlains have nothing more to hope from that quarter but they may have some Interest in the devastation of the country and the exter mination of the Boers In order that gold and diamond mining operations may be resumed and extended by their friends without interference from the old posses sors of the soil It is a sad situation all around It is one that cannot be long maintained with out making trouble for Great Britain As surely as the sun rises the day will dawn on which one or more of the great Powers JBll say In the name of God and his per secuted tortured outraged creatures in South Africa this war of rapine loot and savage vengeance mutt stop If e had a patriotic and old true blue American Administration In Washington that day would De tomorrow The people of this country are not easily stirred They have learned to submit to things a hint of which would have driven their grandfathers or their fathers to arms But they lemonstrated jn tHC months preceding tjje Spanish war that they have hearts andblood In them The extinction of the Boers in blood and fire will not go on forever unnoticed The cries and tears of the persecuted home less Dutch women and children in South Africa will not be forever Ignored The Kitchener saturnalia must come to an THE 

TDCES WASHINGTON SATURDAY DECEMBER 8 1900 end shortly or England will find herself called upon to reckon with a world of enemies A IHstorlcnlTnrnllel The incidents of Shays Rebellion are unfamiliar to the public of today but the memory of that abortive revolution has been revived by the late Edward Bel lamy in the form of a novel In this he dosei ibes vividly the pathetic condition to which the farmers of Western Massa chusetts were reduced by the heavy taxes which made It impossible for them to keep out of debt or eventually out of Jail The prisons were crowded with insolvent debtors and in the nature of things they stayed thcrejndefinitely slmc by confine ment their power of earning was taken from them The few lich men of the community meanwhile gathered in the farms of the insolvent in default of un paid loans or allowed the debtor farmer to remain at large on condition of his working for them at a nominal price The result of it all was that the people tool the law Into their own hands and there was an attempted revolution which effected a change in conditions Debt was removed from the list of offences pun ished by imprisonment and the taxes be came more reasonable There Is a curious analogy between the condition of these Massachusetts farmers In 17S0 and the years Immediately follow ing and the condition of certain classes of laboring people all over the country In the j ear lriOf The oppression of today is on a scale far grentcr tliRn that of the last ccnturj and affects not the whole working population but large classes here and there Wherever money gives a man more power than he ought to have there this condition of oppression exsts The emplojer of today cannot Imprison a man for debt but he can throw him out of work and keep him out In Berkshire County just before Shays Rebellion practically all the farmers and mechanics in some villages were either in jail or working for nominal wages saving their nominal liberty at the expense of their Independence and completely In the pow er of the man who happened to hold their mortgage In some communities today the entire population except the capital ist who has his mortgage on the freedom of the citizens is either working for him at his price or In the ranks of the unem ployed It may he said that it Is not so bad for a man to be discharged as to be put In prison for debt but the actual result In both cases is often nearly the same The man who is put In prison loses not only the time he spends there hut the tmc whether long or short which It tkes for him to get back his strength ftill and custom when he leaveB the place and also whatever extra work Is needed to get his business Into the con dition in it was when he gave It up The man who Is unemploj ed for any great length of time loses first the wages he might have earned during that time sec ond the money which he sometimes has to borrow to support himself and his family and third a certain confidence in himself and ability In his special line of work Every day that he Is out of work lessens bis chance of getting It just as every day in prison lessened the debtors chance of getting out In these days when the whole trade in one commodity io onfmllcd by a single firm an action on their part which tlirowa several hundred men out of employment in that particular locality means a large addition to the tramp army In the case of the Massa chusetts rebellion the trouble was caused by Inordinate taxation It is well to re member lu this day and generation that when taxes are levied they are paid not out of a Fortunatus pocket but by peo ple who are obliged to earn money enough to live or starve to death and that there Is a limit bejond which taxes cannot be raised or steals carried on without se rious trouble Senator Galllngers report in tho Sen ate yesterday on the unwholesome condi tion of Washingtons drinking water shows that there Is ever reason whj Con gress should act Immediately in the di rection of relief from existing conditions It would seem plain that our present sup ply Is infected with tjphold germs there being no other way apparently to ac count for the prevalence of that disease What is needed to begin with Is a tnnd filtration plant without any patent alum or other Jobbing devices about it Even then it is doubtful if typhoid germs could be filtered out Probably they will be with us to the end of time or at least until we stop drinking the sewage cf Hngerstown and Harpers Terry At the Cabinet meeting yesterday tho vexed question of the Philippine currency was discussed and it was

holiday distribution Weather conditions are still a drawback to the trade in winter weight goods but It It notable that a better report come3 from the Northwest than for some woeks past Southern trade advices remain good but retail business at Eastern mar kets Is still reported backward In the rgcr lines of trade new features arc not numerous Textiles are quiet and rather dull with agents pending the opening of the spring season Wool and woolens are still quiet Cot ton is irregular and the market Is at a balance pending the publication of the next Government crop report which however Is expected to approximate 6750000 bales The high cost of raw cot ton has not as yet been equated by the advance in manufactured goods A hope ful feature this week however was the taking of a large lot of brown cottons for export to China The higher trend of values in Novem ber has been duplicated in the first week of December and cereals long backward in this respect have led the advance which however has not been steadily malntaineel The better business In No vember is being reflected in renewed gains In railway earnings over last years exceptional returns Bank clearings swelled by enormous interest payments are the heaviest ever recorded Finished products monopolize the ac tivity In the iron and steel trades with bars plates sheets and bridge material most active In finished

customers an opportunity to se cure by means of a nickel slot trade maj chlno any article of value additional to that for which such customers have pall Is held by the Supreme Court of Georgia in the case of Meyer vs State 37 S Eji Rep 96 to violate the statute which dc dares that no person shall keep main tain employ or carry en any lottery 14 this State or other scheme or device for the hazarding of any money or valuables thing The accused was a wholesale and retail dealer In cigars and chewing gum On the day alleged in th accusation he was operating a nickel slot trade ra chine The manner of the operation of the machine is as follows A nickel 1 placed in the slot a handle Is pulled down a wheel within the machine res Tolves and when it comes to a stop thi number of cards constituting a hand la a game of poker are exhibited The per on depositing the nickel Is entitled to at cigar or package of chewing gum each valued at 5 cents and in addition there to a prize according to the hand dis played The court held that the device violated the statute on the ground that any scheme or device operated by a per son by which one participating therein might either lose the money Invested or get more than his moneys worth tha operator retaining the money so lost Is a scheme or device for the hazarding of money It was contended that the scheme was not within the meaning of the statute because it Imposed no risk whatever upon the customer the whole risk being assumed by the accused But the court held that In order to constitute a game of hazard or a bet it was not nec essary that there must be risk In both parties If from the terms of the engage ment the court held one of the parties may gain but cannot lose and the other may lose but cannot gain and there must be either a gnin by the cne or a loss by the other according to the happening of the contingency it Is as much a bet or wager as if the parties had shared equally the chance of gain and loss The United States Circuit Court of Ap peals has no jurisdiction of cases of con viction of capital crime according to the Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Good Shot is United States 104 Fed Rep 257 and the court holds that the test which determines whether or not a case Is one of conviction of a capital crime Is not the penalty which Is actually imposed but it Is that which may be Imposed Under a statute In Mississippi providing a penalty for getting on or off a moving train but especially exempting passengers -and train employes from Its operation i passenger wag arrested by direction of the railway company for getting off a train of the Alabama and Vicksburg Railway Com pany while it was rrovlng He brought mlt against the road for false Imprison ment and obtained a verdict of 500 which the Supreme Court sustained Alabama and Vicksburg Railway Company vs Kuhn 2S So Rep 797 While walking along a railway com panys right of way which was generally used by pedestrians a man was injured by a piece of clone which was hurled against him by a passing train This stone constituted a part of the ballast of the track and was dislodged and thrown against the man by the movement of the train The injured party brought suit against tho railroad company on the ground that the company owed him the duty of so plating the material used in ballasting its track that it would not be thrown against him In the manner stated But the Supreme Ccurt Georgia held that he could not recover saying In part Cer tainly It cannot he claimed that nnder the facts appearing It was Incumbent on the railway company relatively to the plaintiffs protection from Injury to exer cise more than ordinary diligence The di3lodgrreni of the stone was a mere cas ualty Other trains had passed over the spot where it lay without dislodging it from its place and even under the theory that the company was under any duty at all of protecting pedestrians from being Injured as the plaintiff was It would at les t have to appear that the company war wanting in ordinary care and prudence as to the manner In which its track was bal lasted and kept In order It would be going a great length to bold that such a theory was good law In any case for rail way companies can hardly be expected to construct or maintain their roadbeds with a view to protecting people who choose even perralsslvely to walk along rights of way from such catastrophe as that which happened in the present Instance Clar dy vs Southern Railway Company 37 S E Rep 93 The sale without a license of a medici nal preparation

making the sale intended that It should be used as a medicine or otherwise and without reference to the purpose for which It was bought by the purchaser -While It Is not competent to Impeach a witness by proving that he has led a life of moral turpitude or has been guilty of immoral acts the Supreme Court of Georgia In the case of Wheeler vs State 37 S E Rep 126 holds that a witness whose own testimony disclosed that such are the facts with respect to his life and conduct may be thereby dis credited the jury being left free to de termine for itself what weight and ef fect should be given to such facts In a case of murder the Court of Ap peals of Kentucky in the case of Bishop vs Commonwealth 58 S W Rep 817 holds that it is not Improper for the prosecuting attorney In arguing the case to the Jury to refer to the defendant as a murderer and an assassin Whether he was a murderer and an as sassin said the court was the very question which was on trial and we do not consider It Improper for the District Attorney in the course of his argument to make a statement to the Jury which amounted to nothing more or less than the expression of his opinion that de fendant was guilty Where In a political convention the pre siding officer directs that the temporary chairman be selected by ballot and In his temporary absence from the platform a delegate addresses the convention and
