If the Administration had been conscious of fullsuc e< ~> in its elTorfs o:i this subject, the Presideal would hove kfl the reenlte to vin dieete Ins eoiiBe. If Luhne in am dofttee had beee obbm d only bydefeettre legislation et CroeejtiBeeteBBl BooMtttar, be Bright have rested in the BBBBfBBee thut an intelligent people would have itpiuvcin.ed both the cfioit and th(? opposi? tion. The truth is that Mm iO^OBOOeei of the Admiiiistration has resulted in part from its own lack of consistency ami in part from pos? itive public disapproval of BBBb reform ;u> has U'cn BBtde manifest in some OJlBetBtBMBl and acts of the A<ln;inistration. The appoint? ment of serviceable Ohio polith BBN, or personal friends of the Preaident, or individuals like George Butler, or men who had actively p;tr ticipated in the decision of the ehvloral dis? pute in Southern States, has rot seemed to the public entirely consistent with the theo? ries bv uhleb the President insist* that s ? itors ami BBBflBOl iitativen should lx> governed; nor have the people of this gnat Stnte approved the removal of officials acknowledged to be faithful aud ? fli ?ie'it. Ihil the Administration is to be fairly congratulated e:i ti, improved tone ot the service. Wo d*o not think much of it is due to competitive examinations, but it is due to something the Ad minis nation has done or has forborne doing, for which it d? serves all honor. TfcO civil owiec of the country is more cflh'ient and eronomical than it was; and it is cleun. There are no scandals ami no thefts; and for this Mr. Hayes VUI i:> I great and increasing credit.

Ileif events afford an unanswerable vindic.luui of the Adiuinistration and the Re? publican parly. Resumption has ih? r. nccom piiehtd, the. I'lesidcnt staU h. with BBBb success that the anio iiit of notes rede?MBOd is about $40,000,000 less timn the ajMPJM of sjiecii dfcjHioited iu exchange for notes. Nevertheless, the President recommends th.'t tin- BBBBBj which Mm people so greatly prefer to coin, shall lie redeemed and retired perforce, iu order to bring coin into general circulation. The President does not in terms dBBMKfJ from the Secretary of the n BBUty ; for the retireineut of notes having the legul-tcnd'^ quality might he reached, a? Mm Secretary recommends, by a mere rc|?eal of li e Lt u'al-Ti nder Ai t. leaving Treasury notes, no longer legal-tenders, to remain in use il the people demand them. The remarks of Mm President on the refunding of the. debt SBd on the unlimited coinage of hilver ure eminently just, and he recommends that the coinage of silve r dollars should be ou.sp? uded, boOOBSS the fjrOVSCBBSBBt has been able lo get into circulation only $13.700,844 out of 848,000*850 coined up to November 1.

If 00 the Artl publication ??f the news they had devot-sj to the vt ihcatimi of it u quarter of the time njd Mmpj which they wasted in abusing us for prinling it, they would have Iteen spared n great ittl of mortiticc tion, embairasstne.it a id discredit. Itut malic* blinded them to their own int? rest. They could think of nothing bur tl"> unpar? donable offene? of Tni TnaBtnrs. One paper made fun, in Im editorial page, of "tto people it. "Wall Street, who allowed themselvea to be "lievc a story published la Th_ Tiiiiu nk to ??the advantage of Mr. day Gould, notwith " standing the dlotincl denial of flint story j "made by Mr, Vandeihilt, upon some alleped "action of whan it turned"; whir its its finan? cial column it eon tinned, up to too very day of the official IDMWCJjaent Of the sale, to call tlie* story "a hoax.'' and a very clumsy hoax, too, invented for the 1m uctit of n clique of speculators?| irick to "fool" the public, which " should take iis place I " with other jam from the same lource, and '? needs no further mention." Another paper, >iill more reckless in its bates, besjrjB by df daring that the report wm n fabrication, ?* made out of whole cloth '"; " there w-i* no "combination, no BTttdieate, no proposition to "buy Central at 1 20 "; and to this view of the matter ir steadt!}' adhered. The day be? ton the official announcement it ptth__hod a long editorial harangue upon the " prostitu '* tion " of ThB Tum VI".. e;tllin_ the story "a wild fable,'1 "false," " fraudulent." "pre " posti roiis,"' u "stock-jobbing fabricotion," etc., etc., and acetudng thin .journal of enter? ing into a conspiracy to gull the public. A thud paper waited until the very day ot the sale, and then described the story as an it - famous bear operation. A fourth contented itself with n general denial of the report as a prepoateroBi t-tock-ioblung canard. An evening paper, whose financial reporter had nciiteiicas enough to discover ami sense enough to sty that the story was tine, never? theless allowed itself to imply editorially, the day the bargain was conclude.il, that .the re? ported negotiations were collusive, ami that Till. TsiBUNE was an accomplice in scheme of "rank robbery." Auother evening piper called the report a "cock-ami bull story"; and a third, i ftcr a day or so of deliberation, pronounced it "beyond qu.slioo a colossal "lie." Semi-Solomon wails fill all is over ami the sale completed, and then solemnly olkserves that "Thk Thiihsk has since the "panic tear no w lodged thai the story was un " true'' (!) and that it "owes the public an " explanation of its course.*' The extraordinary conduct of several Xow York papers in relation to the Stewart grave robber] WM no dO?bl influenced by antlUOeitj toward their i?MUltlllne There was such a feverish desire in the breasts of certain editors not only to surpass a hated rival in enterprise but to do him an injury and offer him an i - suit, that they were incapable of exercising ordinury discretion in any case wliich called this leeling into piny. If Thk Tuiplnk asserted that the body of Mr. Stewart had not been found, that was, for such hearty haters, a reason for maintaining that it had been found, in spite of all evidence to tlie con? trary. If i iik Tkihi nk denied the reported Arrest of the robbers, nothiutr would per. uade these worthies that the robbers were not in custody. They shut their eyes tight, ami saw nothing but tin dlatorted uaagea born of their evil passions. The Tuint'n't:, almost nlone of the New-York press, told the plain troth about this affair from the beginning, and refused to credit the sens;,tion.tl store - which werf daily gpnasj In fore the public while the exeitei" nt lasted. Others might have seen tin.nigh the transparent falsehoods if they had not been blinded by envy and malice. A still more conspicuous ilia.-.ration oi the mis? chief arising fnm the indulgence of ! aired in jonrnaliam was allbrdcd at the time of the last Republican State Convention ot New-York, when a Bepnblican parier ot this city was so insanely eager to prevent the nomination of Mr. Cornell ?hat it wi nt ou day alter da) assuring its readeri?and we dare say it penruaded itself?that he would not and could not receive the votes of the Convention. It declared thr.t those who predicted his suecer,s were, only " playing a game of brag,*' and that the " absurdity*' of claiming for him as many as 220 votes tlOM than a majority) " must b? at once apparent to those who have " even a aupcriicial know ledge of the situation." The more Mr. Cornell gained, the lender this pap) shrieked that tie was " losing support." At 1 o'clock on the morning of the cveiiflul day, Its corrcspondert at the Convention tele? graphed that Mr. Cornell was practically "out "of the held." A few hours t.der he was nominsted on the llr*,t ballot. Thk Tiiiiii nk had all along indicated the probability of this result ; and for that outrage, probably neither Mr. Cornell nor the Tm. Tkiimsk will ever be forgiven. Last Safunlay the grecn-cyed monster was rampant again. Thk Tmut nk alone pub? lished the Annual Bopori of Mm Secretary of tin- Trooonry. Other jotanala lantrnod in some way at WaaaiagtajB that a copy of this iiu pertMI docuinent bail been obtained by us, ami tiny be_ari with one accord to discredit it in advance. The report (which they had ?Ot yet seen) was " ll.-egul:.r"; ir Wut incom raVtteJ it was ii WUfepUtional synopsis; no? body ought to truat it; nobody, we suppose, ought to mad it. Dottbtlntl some of them would hive said plumply, it ih.y hid ilaretl, that this too was "a stock-jobbing canard." It w u I childish outcry; the editois might have nllcct"d that, if th<\v were to be news pamorii IkOJ v. mid ba~e to prtnl the verv same text after us, und that it would be much easier to do it gracefully, in dignified silence, than to invite nil the world to wit? ness that they were ungiy und discomfited. Ii, :.lines hke thc.-c Bight bo continued, but It is needless. IJnefly formulated, the rul(> of tin ai>c,iy louiii.il.-? has seemed to be, " If Thk "iitint Nfc beats you on new*, declare its news "false, deceive your own readers am' lie your " way through." Thk 'I_m;sk, too, some? time* gets beaten, for the utmost care and enterprise must occasionally fail. Its rule then, is to copy the news just as fully as the interest at ill retained wUl waiTaut, with J wh:if?vcr credit to its successful rivals seem* fairly due.
