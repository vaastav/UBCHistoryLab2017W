The action of those who are asking for free text books for the Roman Catholic parochial schools is manifestly improper. The free text books are intended for the schools which are under the control of the Board of Education and for no other. If I the parochial schools can with propriety ask for text books any private school in the city can do the same thing, and on practically the same grounds. The origin ators and promoters of the parochial schools choose to carry them on without reference to the pnblio school system. They have therefore no valid claim to share the benefits of that system. . They are opposed to it, and, as many of the peo ple of New Haven and other places where the question has risen think, very unreas onably opposed to it. Of course every body understands that the Roman Cath olic church doesn't think much of the pub lic school system of this country. It is also pretty well understood that the peo ple as a whole do think well of it, and they don't want any confusion of ideas concerning it. Therefore, if there must be parochial schools, why shouldn't those who want them take all the care of .them. J How Lost! How Regained, KN0W1HYM giscclUmcoxis. ANNUAL TOWN MEETING.

DO YOUR DUTY TO-DAY. Be sure and vote to-day. Vote early, because voting early greatly assists the workers at the polls. Vote for James D. Dewell, because he is a first-rate business man, a public-spirited man, a man who knows what the city needs, and a man who is willing to give the city the benefit of his ability and energy. Therefore he will make a good mayor. He did not seek the nomination. It was thrust upon him, be cause the convention thought that if any body it could select would win he was the man. He ought to be elected. He ought I to be voted for regardless of politics, and I he will -be to a greater or less extent. Many of the voters of ihia oily axe not of such hide-bound partisanship that they feel it necessary to have either an ancient or a recent Democrat for mayor. What they want is the man who, in thoir judg ment, will do the best for the city. Mr. Dewell will "get the votes of many such i. In order that they may tell in the result it will be wise for all those Republi cans who are in tho habit of suiting their convenience about voting to be sure and come out of thoir caves to-day. Every vote counts, and Mr. Dewell may be elect ed or defeated by a very few votes. Do your duty early in the morning and then have peace the rest of the day. charity organizations the proportion of adult able-bodied paupers in London, in door and ont, exclusive of vagrants, was 6.7 per ,000; in 1888 it was 8.2, Jay Gould is, after all, or at least has been, like other folks. He recalls the fact that, when he first arrived in New York, he was told very confidentially that there was gold mine for sale up in New Hamp shire. He invested $250 in it, and he has never since been able to find either the county or the town where the mine was supposed to be located. But he has kept the certificate. There are some bad boys in Minnesota. A careful inquiry in the Minnesota State Reform School some time ago revealed the fact that a majority of the boys commit ted for crime had attended Sunday school until near the time of their commitment. Forty per cent, of them came direct from homes; 43 per cent, more had lived at heme until within one year of their com mitment, and only 13 per cent, were en tirely homeless.

Companies to develop coal lands, to build steel cars, to make plumb ers' supplies, to manufacture engines, cot ton goods, to establish stock yards and packing houses, to quarry stones, to build a 7,000-horse-power canal, and to cut and saw lumber are included in the list, and the nominal capital involved is over $10,000,000 for the enterprises reported in one week. At a meeting of the Illinois State board of health in Chicago the other day Dr. Ranch presented some depressing figures and facts touching the possibility of cholera next spring. He has recently re turned from Europe, where he devoted most of his time to studying sanitary questions especially in relation to epi demics. In five months ten thousand people had died of cholera in Spain, Japan and Syria. Of the pilgrims to Mecca it is estimated that 30,000 suc cumbed to the plague. Many of these were from northern Africa, Tunis, Tripoli and Algeria, and the . paths by which through the survivors the plague might be communicated to Europe and sent west ward are those through which it has suc cessfully entered in the past. Cold weather had ended its ravages for the winter but it may reasonably be feared that danger will reappear in spring. The imperial German census will be taken on the night of November 30 De cember 1. In Germany cenbus cards are left by government officials at every house before census night, and on these cards the householder records on the succeeding morning all the required information con cerning all persons, transient or perma nent, during the night. Thus all duplica tion and omission are avoided. The ques tions on the census card concern the rela tionship of each person to the householder, occupation, religion, military service and rank, and mother tongue, besides the usual inquiries as to age, etc. In Prussia, a typical German Stats, it is expected that, despite the heavy emigration, this year's census will show an increase in round numbers from 27,000,000 in 1830, to 30, 000.000 in 1ROO, o.-n.i-.l.ly U pr cent, "little Prussia" of the days of Na poleon I. will then have more than sex- THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. tupled her population in years. the last eighty That is about the amount that New Be loners in Housekeeping save by purchasing their Ontflt I of Us. i A Recent Purchaser i Whom we had tho pleasure of furnishing com- I plete was so well pleased that he TOLD A

We do not suppose that "the reading public" is often intensely interested in presidents' messages, but in the message sent to congress by President Harrison yesterday there is much that is interest ing. The silver question is treated carefully, and the president wisely remarks: Some months of further trial will be necessary to determine the permanent effect of the re cent legislation upon silver values, but it is gratifying to know that the increased circulation secured by the act has exerted and will continue to exert a most beneficial influence upon business and upon general values. Concerning the tariff bill the president has views, and he is not backward in giv ing them. He says: There is neither wis dom nor justice in the suggestion that the subject of tariff revision shall be again opened before this law has had a fair trial. It is quite true that every tariff schedule is subject to objections. No bill was ever framed, I sup pose, that in all of its rates and classifications had the full approval even of a party canons. Such legislation is always and necessarily the product of compro mises as to details, and the present law is no exception. But in its general scope and effect I think it will justify the support of those who believe that American legisla tion should conserve and defend American trade and the wages of American work men. The President repeats, with added ur gency, his previous recommendations con cerning the development of American steamship lines. He is outspoken in favor of reciprocity. He recommends the es tablishment of an American international bank. He would also like to see the bill for the relief of the Supreme court passed, national bankrupt law enacted, just copywright protection to foreign authors, something done to stop the killing and wounding on freight trains, and he favors the use of the. telegraph by the Postoffice department. Ha also stands up for an effective federal election law. This part of the message is especially well worth the attention of every American citizen. The message as a whole will make a good impression.

PAS-AXXBICAH COXOBSSS. The friendly relations of our country with the nations of Europe and of the east have been undisturbed, while the ties of good will and common Interest that bind us to the states of the western hemisphere have been notably strengthened by the conferences held in this capitol to consider measures for the general welfare. Pur suant to the investigation authorized by congress the representatives of every inde pendent state of the American continent and of Hayti met in conference in this cap itol in October, 1889, and continued iu session until the 19th of last April. This important convocation marks a most in teresting and influential epoch in the his tory of the western hemisphere. It is noteworthy that Brazil, invited while under an imperial form of government, shared as a republic in the deliberations and results of the conference. The recom mendations of this conference were all transmitted to congress at the last session. THE MARINE COSOHESS. The international marine conference which sat at Washington last winter reached a very gratifying result. The reg jilstionaanggetted 1'sve been brought to :he attention of all frovernments repre sented, and their general adoption is con fidently expected. The legislation of con gress at the last session is in conformity with the proposition of the conference, and the proclamation therein provided for will be issued when the other powers have given notice of their adhesion. THE SLAVE TRADE IN AFRICA. The conference of Brussels to d.vise means for suppressing the slave trade in Africa, afforded an opportunity for a new expression of the interest the American people feel in that great work. It soon be came evident that the measure- proposed would tax the resources of the Congo basin beyond the revenues available under the general act of Berlin of 18S4. The United States, not being a party to that act, couldn't share In its revision, but by a separate act the independent state of the Congo was freed from the restrictions up on a customs revenue. The demoralizing and destructive traffic in ardent spirits among the tribes also claimed the earnest attention of the conference, and the dele gates of the United States were foremost in advocating measures for its suppression. A" accord was reached, the influence of which will be very helpful and extend over a wide region. As soon as the meas ures shall receive the sanction of the Neth erlands, for a time . withheld, the general acts will be submitted for a ratification by the senate. Meanwhile negotiations have been opened for a new and complete treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation between the United States and the Inde pendent State of Congo. THE FISANCE3. The revenues of tho government from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890, were $1G3,9C3,080.55, and the total expenditures for the same period were 8358.618.584.52. The postal re ceipts have not heretofore been included in the statement of these aggregates, and for the purpose of comparison the sum of $60,882,097.93 should be deducted from both sides of the account. The surplus for the year, including the amount ap plied to the sinking fund, was 105,344, 496.03, the receipts for 1890 were $16,030, 923.79 and the expenditures 15,739,871 in excess of those of 18bH. The customs receipts were increased $5,835,848.88, and the receipts from internal revenues $11,- 725,191.89, while on the side of expendit ures that for pensions was $19,813,075.96 in excess of the preceding year. The treasury statement for the current fiscal year, partly actual and partly esti mated, is as follows: Receipts from all sources. $406,000,000; total expenditures, $354,000,000, leaving a surplus of $52,000,000, not taking the postal receipts into the account on either side. The loss of revenue from customs for the last quarter is estimated at $25,000, OlM), but from this is deducted a gain of about $16,000,000, realized during the first four months of the year. For the rear 1892 the total estimated receipts are $373,000,000 and the estimated expendit ures $357,852,209.42, leaving an estimated surplus of $15,147,790.5. which, with a cash balance of $52,000,000 at the begin niiiK of tho year, will give $07,147,790.58 as tho sum available for the redemption of outstanding bonds or other uses. The estimates of receipts and expenditures for the iKistoffice department being equal, are not included in this statement on either side. THE SILVER QUESTION. An act "demanding the purchase of sil ver bullion and the issue of treasury notes thereon," approved July 14, 1890.has been administered by the secretary of the treas ury with tho purposes in view to get into circulation at the earliest date possible the full .monthly amounts of treasury notes contemplated by its provision and at the same time to give .to the market for silver bullion such support as the law con templates. The recent depreciation in the price of silver has been observed with re gret. The rapid rise in price which an ticipated and followed the passage of the act was influenced in some degree by spec ulation, and the recent reaction is in part the resnlt of the same cause and in part of the recent monetary disturbances. Some months of further trial will be necessary to determine the permanent effect of the recent legislation upon silver values, but It Is gratifying to know that the increased circulation secured by the act has exerted and will continue to exert a most bene ficial influence upon business and upon general values. While it has not been thought best to re new formally the suggestion of an interna tional conference looking to an agreement to adopt the full use of silver for coinage at a uniform ratio, care has been taken to observe closely any change in the situation abroad. No favorable opportunity will be lost to promote a result which it is confi dently believed would, corner very large benefit upon the commerce of the world. The recent monetary disturbances in Eng land are not likely to suggest a comparison of opinions upon this subject. Our very large supply of gold will, if not lost by im pulsive legislation in tho supposed interest of silver, give us a position of advantaga in promoting a permanent and safe basis for the exchange of silver. The efforts of tho secretary to increase the volume of money in circulation by keepiiijj-drrwn the treasury surplus to the lowest practicable limit, have been unre mitting and in a very high degree success ful. The tables presented by him show ing the increase of money in circulation during the last two decades, and especial ly the table showing the increase during ths nineteen months be has administered the affairs of the department are interest ing and instructive. The increase of mon ey in circulation during the nineteen months has been in the aggregate $93,866, 813, or about $1.50 per capita, and of this increase only $7,100,000 was due to the re cent silver legislation. That the substan tial and needed aid given to commerce re sulted in an enormous reduction of the public debt and of the annual interest charge is a matter of increased satisfac tion. There have been purchased ana redeem ed since March 4, 1SJ9, 4 and 4$ per cent bonds to the amount of $211,$32,450 at a cost of $346,620,741, resulting in the re duction of the annual interest cuarge or $8,67,609, and a total saving of interest of $5l,oo,oo. I notice with great pleasure the state ment of the secretary that the receipts from internal revenue have increased dur ing the last fiscal year nearly $12,000,000, and that the cost of collecting this larger revenue was less by $90,617 than for the same purpose in the preceding year. The percentage of cost of collecting the customs revenue was less for the last fiscal year than ever before. THE ARMY. The report of the secretary of war ex hibits several gratifying results attained during the year by wise and unostenta tious methods. Tho percentage of deser tions from the army (an evil for which both congress and the department have long been seeking a remedy) has been re duced during tne past year twenty tour per cent., and for the months of August and September, during which time the favorable effects of the act of Jane were felt, thirty-three per nL, at compared with the same months of 1889. The results attained by a reorganixation and euusolidation of the divisions having charge of the hospital and Barrio records of the volunteer soldiers, are very remark able. This change waa effected In July, 1889, and at that time, there were 40,654 cases awaiting attention; mora than half of these being calls from the pension office for information necessary to the adjudica tion of pension claims. On the 30th day of June last, though over three hundred thousand new calls had come in, there waa not a single case that had not been exam ined and answered. I concur in the recommendation of the secretary that adequate and regular appro priations be continued for coast defense works and ordnance. Plans have been practically agreed upon and then can bo no good reason for delaying the execution of them while the defenseless state of our great seaports furnishes an urgent reason for wise expenditures. The encouragement that has been ex tended to the militia of the states, generally and most appropriately designated as the "National Guard," should be continued and enlarged. These military organizations constitute in a large sense the army of the United States, while about five-sixths of the annual cost of their maintenance is de frayed by the states. PENSIONS. t JTha disability pension , act,, which waa approved on the 2,th of June last, has been put into operation as rapidly as was practicable. The increased clerical force provided was selected and assigned to work, and a considerable part of the force engaged in examinations in the field was recalled and added to the working force of the office. The examination and adjudica tion of claims have, by reason of Improved methods, been more rapid than ever be fore. There is no economy to the govern ment in delay, while there is much hard ship and injustice to the soldier. Ths anticipated expenditure, while very large, will not, it is believed, be in excess of the estimates made before the enactment of the law. This liberal enlargement of the gen eral law should suggest a more careful scrutiny of bills for special relief both as to the cases where relief is granted and to the amount allowed. UTAH. The increasing numbers and influence of the non-Mormon population in Utah are observed with satisfaction. The recent letter of Wilford Woodruff, president of the Mormon church, in which he advised his people "to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land," has attracted wide attention, and it is hoped that its influence will be highly beneficial in restraining infractions of the laws of the United States. But the fact should not be overlooked that the doctrine or belief of the church that polygamous marriages are rightful and supported by . divine revelation remains unchanged. President Woodruff does not renounce the doctrine, but refrains from teaching it and advises against the practice of it because the law is against it. Now it is quite clear that the law should not attempt to deal with the faith or belief of anyone, but it is quite another thing, and the only safe thing, so to deal with the territory of Utah as that those who believe polygamy to be rightful ehall not have the power to make it lawful.
