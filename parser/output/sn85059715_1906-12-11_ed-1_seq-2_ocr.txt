CHARLES W. ARTHUR. Washington, Dec. 11.?[Special.]?Discussion of the president's message continues to be a feature of each day at. the capitol. The document -was so voluminous and so much time was necessary to master its contents that many members of congress who declined to say anything at all about It last week are talking now. With the exception of that portion of it relating to the Japanese question* which Is still resented bj the California legislators and senators and rep resentatlves rrom tne coast stares generally, the message was probably better received than any similar paper which Mr. Roosevelt has submitted to. congress since he became president. The conservative Republicans liked it because ft did not seem to them to be . as radical as those which had preceded it. Its recommendations concerning corporations and Income and inheritance taxes were not sufficiently extreme to cause alarm among those members of the dominant party who are opposed to fadicallsm. Democrats Pleased. On the other hand, there was presented the unusual spectacle of many Democrats speaking of the message In terms of vigorous approval. "We have lassoed the president to the triumphal -car of Democracy on the questions of an income tax and au Inheritance I tax." was the way Minority Leader Williams put it. "This, combined with the rope already tyiug him. make* him pretty close to being n captive." The Democrats were especially pleased with that portion of the message in which the president recommended the enactment of 11 law prohibiting corporations from contributi lug to campaign funds. Both' Demo crnts ami Kcpmiucaiis iuce<i nis reference to the ('tibau question. Except so far as the matter of annexation la concerned the two parties nre pretty well together In their attitude toward i Cuba. i Labor Element Disappointed. | The few extreme labor memlters of . congress were not over pleased with what the president bud to say about labor legislation, but, ou the other hand. Speaker Canuon. Representative IJttleflcld and other Republican members wliom President Compere of the American Federation of Labor attempted to defeat In the last congressional campaign are highly gratified. The plan of the speaker and his ' 'HSflt^binitR Is to defeat all pending labor bills In the Judiciary committee i with the exception of the Gilbert antlinjunetlon hfll. This, according to present plans, will be reported favor_ ably front the committee and Itpaaed with some amendments suggested by the president. Mr. Gomper, Embarrassed. Mr. Gompers, by the way, has been placed in rather an embarrassing position l>y the action of a largo number of labor unions all over the country. At Oie last animal meeting of the American Federation of Labor, held in Minnon|?olls. Mr. Qotupers' opi>oeltlon to the ship subsidy bill was heartily indorsed. Tills- was accepted ns a clear indication that organized labor generally Is opposed to the ship Snbven tlon measure which la now pending before tlio bouse committee on morebnnt murine and fisheries, having passed the senate at the last session. But recent developments show this la not the case. For some days Speaker Cannon has been in receipt of large numbers" of resolutions pusscd by labor anions of various kinds ail over the country which declare that the subsidy bill Is a good thing for all worklugmen and should be enacted Into law. Jiearly 3,000 of these resolutions have been officially filed by the speaker. Some of i the organizations represented are affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, which complicates matters con- 1 slderably.' Nobody knows who-started , The nbjwt baa twn.flulieni at .

Many members who think that salaries ought to be higher than they are now will not be willing to vote to make an increase "applicable so soon. They would put It so far In the future, they say. as to make It certain that , they -will not be in congress then. Thus they would avoid the charge of Increasing tlielr own emoluments at the pnbllc expense. A Tnngh Clitckes.
