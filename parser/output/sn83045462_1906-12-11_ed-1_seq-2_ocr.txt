shall do so. If for any reasons, whether political in the narrow or In the largest sense, I cannot. I shall tell you so frankly. Personal reason* can never exist when I do not do anything you say. Bellamy was right about it being needless to write me In order to keep him in mind. I think of both of you all the timf. and have gone over several times possible plans. First, as to the cabini-t. It is very unlikely now that I shall change any member of the present cabinet. You hare probably seen that I have asked them all to stay. Root the Strongest. " 'The Secretary of War, Root, is one of the very strongest men before the people In our whole party. His Canton speech was the most effective delivered In the campaign last year. His advice Is invaluable, not merely In reference to his department, but In reference to all branches of the service. As for his department, It Is at the nresent time the most important in the en tire government. It would be a public calamity to have him leave the cabinet now. and I use the words public calamity advisedly. He is a sick man, a condition that gives me great uneasiness, not because there Is the fear of his death, but i lest he may have to give lip his work here. If he went out I should have to consider nothing whatever but the question of getting the best man the entire country afforded to do the work necessary to be done. It may be that after carefully looking over the matter I should conclude that Bellamy was the man for the purpose. It may be tliut I should liave to include someone else of whom I have no thought at present would be the best man, and If so I should be In honor bound to take him and not to consult any persona] preference of 1 mine in a matter so vital to the Country. , 1 uu nui r 111HI ovcmurjr intends to leave the navy. In this department I am sure without further thought that Bellamy would be admirable, but In tilling any vacancy In the cabinet I would ] have to take note of all kinds of consider- ( ations. I should count Bellamy's religion ( in his favor for a cabinet place. Other things being equal. I should like to have a ' Catholic in the cabinet. I am sure that in ' the Navy Department he would do ex- ] ceedlngly well as secretary. I do not know whether geographically he would be the right man. For instance I should like much to get a Pacific slope man into the cabinet, and particularly In the Navy Department, and I do not wish to leave New England unrepresented. At present I see i no Pacific slope man who will be competent to fill the position. -Moreover, if , possible, I should like to get one or more members of the cabinet who are in close touch with the people carrying weight when they explain policlt-s, purposes and acts of my administration. ' The Idea) Cabinet Officer. " 'This is the one point in which the present cabinet Is not as strong as It should , ue. 1 UU I1U I utiitvo iuai a i i iic-1, aiuici, i more high-minded body of public servants j was ever gotten together around a President, but there Is no one of them, with the i possible exception of Root (who Is so busy that he can hardly ever speak), who can appear before the country with the prestige of a great political leader to explain and champion my administration. If I could at any time fill this want, I should most ardently desire to do so. In other words, for , a cabinet place the man should. If possible, be not only eminently fit for the administration of his department, but also, if possible, a party leader of weight, and, furthermore, It is rarely that one can fill a cabinet position with reference only to Itself?all surrounding conditions must be ' taken into account. Now, after foreign ? affairs, my inquiries speedily develop the fact that a Catholic just at present would not be a man whom It would be wise to ] send to Germany. For wholly different J reasons it would be wise to send him to Italy. I had not thought of or known either of these facts when I advocated Bel- 1 lumy's going to Italy. As soon as I made Inquiry to the effect, both here and abroad, I of appointments to Germany and Italy, I \ found what the facts were. In no other , ca3e would the question of Catholicism cause any serious trouble, but I have not the slightest Idea whether any man intends 1 at present to leave his position. < ' "Of Porter, In France, I hear nothing but s the strongest praise. He seems to have " done peculiarly well. It would be an in- ' justice of a flagrant kind to turn him out ' at the present time. It is, of course, always possible that I may make a shift, j and If in doing so France should become , acant. I should offer it to Bellamy at once, unless it happened that I was able ! to offer him a cabinet position, but as < things are Just at this^tlme I do not see < the likelihood of such a condition arising. I , have written with minutest detail, for I want you to understand exactly how the 1 things now stand. Faithfully yours, 1 (Signed) "

December 11.?The opening of the new secondary industrial t-httul yesterday marked an epoch In Industrial education in Georgia. The school Is the only Institution of Its kind In the south. The object of the school, which was established with the financial assistance of George Foster Peabody of New York, Is to educate young people between fourteen and twenty and prepare them for intelligent service in industrial occupation*. While informal, the opening was attended by many educator* and was marked by a large attendance of pupils, many of them farmer operatives in the Columbus cotton mills, out of emp'oyment through the recently enacted child labor law. An efficient corps of teachers of wide exprrience In industrial training Is In charge of the school. For girls there Is opportunl- 1 t> (or training In dressmaking, millinery aa<l office work, including stenography, tjri" writing, bookkeeping, flllng and lndexteg and the general care of an office.

VANONI CAUSES SENSATION Sets the Crowd Wild by His Spectacular Sprint. AMERICANS' CAREFUL GAME Thirteen Teams Still in Contest? Walthour-Bedell Combination Theoretically Invincible. 1 L i i .*? ' NEW YORK, December 11.?The thirteen teams in the six days' bicycle race at Madison Square Garden are still going: at a mad pace, with no signs of weakening. The score at 2 o'clock this afternoon was: Root-Pogler, 741.1; Downey-Moran, 741.1; Vanderstuyft-Stol, 741.1; MacDonald-Coffey, 741.1; Breton-VanonI, 741.1; SamuelsonHollister, 741.1; Mettling-Logan, 741.1; Hopper-Downing, 741.1; Rutt-MacFarland, 741.1; Salvin-Wiley, 741.1; Pye-Clark, 741.1; 3eorget-Georget, 741.1; Walthour-Bedell, ?41.0. Record, 773.3, made by Elkes and MacFarland in 1000. Knife on the Track. An incident occurred in the garden shortly after 10 o'clock, which came near doing some damaere to RutL As the nollce were shoving' the all-night contingent out for the daily housecleaning, some one In the gallery on the 26th street side, near the entrance, threw a big bowie knife on the track. Jt landed a few Inches behind Rutfs rear wheel and then bounded over into the arena. Rutt was the last man In the bunch, which probably accounts for no one being hurt. The police were notified and a search for the thrower of the knife began. Some one said he saw a swarthy-looking man lean over the gallery railihg and throw something on the track. So a hunt for a swarthylooking man was at once begun. All sorts of rumors gained more or less credence at the garden in explanation of the Incident. The word "black hand" was mentioned frequently, but only to draw forth laughs from most of those who heard it. Another guess was that some compatriot had it In for Vanonl and took this way of trying to do him injury, either by disconcerting htm or by actually hitting him with the knife. The One O'clock Score. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, New Fork, December 11.?One o'clock score: Root-Folger, 724; Downey-Moran, 724; Vanierstuft-StoI, 724; MacDonald-Coffey, 724; Breton-Vanoni, 724; Samuelson-Hollister, f24; Mattling-1-.ogan, 724; Hopper-Downing, f24; Rutt-McFarland, 724; Galvin-Wiley, r24; Pye-Clark, 724; Georget-Georget, 724; Walt hour-Bedell, 723-9. Record, 753-8. made by Elkes and McFarland in 1900. There was little to mark the beginning of the second day of the race. From midnight jntil 10 o'clock this morning nothing unusual outside of Vanoni's plucky sprint oc:urred. A few other sprints took place, but nobody gained or lost anything in any if them, and the thirteen teams represented in the saucer-circle continued the jrind after each one as though nothing had happened. The feature of the race so far today has been the growing strength of the foreign teams. Vanoni and Breton have alternatelyled the bunch for hours, with one or the sther of the Georget brothers following ilose. Root, Vanderstuyft and Walthour, with their respective partners, are playing i careful game, and have thus far brought ittle glory to themselves. Vanoni'b Great Sprint. Vanonl's sprint at 3 o'clock was the fea of the falls sustained by one of each pair. The two victims of bruises and shaking up were Rupprecht and McDonald, respectively. The attempt to link up Sohlee and Krebs fell through. It Is said, because of Schlee's attempt to get a bonus from the management. Menus Bedell, who suffered a broken collar bone. Is as well as could be expected today, although he will probably remain In bed for a day or two more. With only three teams of a field of sixteen starters out and none of the other riders displaying any weakness, the contest continues to be a very even thing. Knotty Problem Solved. As at this season of the year all are trying to solve the knotty problem of giving their friends it suitable nreftent It la lleved nothing more appropriate than a box of excellent cigars, especially boxed for Christmas, or a beautiful plp?, could be given the man who smokes. Everything that a smoker needs at prices that will suit everybody's purse is to be found in the United Cigar Stores, and it Is claimed that better quality will be received there for the money than can be obtained anywhere else. It is the aim of the company to please customers at all hasards, and no sale is completed there, it Is declared, "until the customer is satisfied." To Investigate Car Shortage.

He Had iust relieved Breton, who. In accordance ulth his usual custom, had given his au revolr to the bunch with a couple of laps >f hard sprinting, when he observed signs >f apparent fatigue on the part of the leaders. Without a second's deliberation Vanoni Jumped Into the place of Breton and started off at a clip that astonished even ireteran watchers of six-day races. The crowd yelled Itself hoarse, and hardly ;ould And time to get Its breath before it was yelling again with excitement, for Vanoni was off with only one man, Stol, the famous Dutch sprinter.

Fortunately for them, Walthour was on the track at the time and he gamely responded. Although he was In next to last position when Vanoni made his bid for the lap, he gave a dozen long jumps and, constantly Increasing his speed till he was going almost thirty miles an hour, at length overhauled the runaways. Then there was no further sprinting until shortly after 4 3'clock, when Vanoni replaced Breton again. The efforts were all too short to be ;uuBiuciru bcijuusi;. iiuwcvbi, mill ine :-rowd only applauded because of the popuarlty of Vanonl and the handsome looking roung Breton.

The Walthour-Bedell combination was ilosely watched by the sharps, who are predicting great things of the versatile pair. \s a theoretical combination they are invincible, despite their handicap of one lap, imposed as the penalty for the new combination. Remarkable Attendance. The attendance at the race continues to be remarkable. With the exception of the boxes, at either end of the great amphitheater, which were only partly occupied, over two-thirds of the seats were filled this morning. There was only one spill between midnight and 7 o'clock, when Moran and Fogler, at 2:35, took a tumble at the west turn on the 27th street side of the track. They were back In the running immediately, however, without any signs of injury. ?o new combination of riders has been formed since Krebs and Rupprecht and Schlee and McDonald retired yesterday.

IMPROVEMENT IN CONDITION Son and Daughter of Former Senator of Hie PaHfiMa IWattnr of Counsel. Dr. W. A. White, superintendent of the Government Hospital for the Insane, called at the house of detention last night with Dr. I?. H. Taylor and conversed with Mrs. Annie M. Bradley, who is under arrest for shooting Arthur Brown, formerly United States senator from Utah. The insanity expert remained at the house of detention for a long time, but he would not divulge the reason for his visit, nor say anything regarding the conclusion he reached. It was stated by counsel, however, that Dr. White was. sent there merely In his capacity as a physician to assist Dr. Taylor. At the same time, it Is stated, Mrs. Bradley Is in splendid physical condition; that she has been given only one dose of medicine, and that was to quiet her nerves. She seemed greatly refreshed this morning after a good rest. It was suggested this morning that the alienist probably determined that the prisoner Is of sound mind. Such is said to be highly probable in view of the almost positive declaration of counsel that her plea is not to be insanity. Mrs. Bradlay sent for additional counsel last night, having been advised that the employment of the firm of Leckie, Fulton & Cox through George W. Bartch, formerly chief Justice of the supreme court of Utah, and John L. Bagley, who held the office of attorney general of Idaho at one time might be distasteful to the wounded man. It is said that the attorneys mentioned and the wounded man are political enemies, probably representing two factions of the same party, and it is not the intention of Mrs. Bradley, It is understood, to do anything that might displease Mr. Brown or his family. Still Loves Him. Mrs. Bradley maintains that she still loves him and seems to believe that when he recovers she will be able to make peace with him. She sent a note to Attorney George P. Hoover of the firm of Wells, Hoover & Wells last evening asking him to call upon her and discuss her case. Vnnnrincr t Ko f \f r T a/>lr in Viasl V\nnn Inif jvuv/n nig inai au> , lluu mv^ii ivuniug after the case Mr. Hoover hesitated about calling on the prisoner. After hearing that the other firm had been employed through the western firm, however, he proceeded to the house of detention -with Mr. Robert W. Wells and conferred with Mrs. Bradley. but did not say that he would enter into the case as counsel. Former Senator Brown seemed much Improved this morning. His daughter. Miss Alice Brown, and his son, Mr. Max Brown, were early callers at the hospital. The young man, who is about to graduate from the law department of the University of Chicago, said he felt certain that his father would recover. "I am going to remain in the city until my father gets well," he stated, "and then I am going to take him home to Salt Lake City." The young man was somewhat annoyed by the publication of a story concerning his domestic affairs. According to a report from Chicago, his wife is suing him ror divorce and maintenance of her child and hersilf. and Brown, the report says, has the distinction of being the only student who has even been sued for divorce. It is stated that he Inherited $20,000 from his mother's estate and that he married Rosamond Smith. "There is some foundation for the story," the young man admitted, "but most of the statements that have been printed are untrue." Condition of Patient. Max Brown left the hospital Just as his half-sister and Dr. William P. Carr reached the institution. Dr. Carr saw the patient and was well pleased with his condition. Dr. Charles E. White, superintendent of the hospital, who is also looking after the wounded man, sees hiill at short Intervals during the night and day and is therefore able to keep constantly advised of his condition. Max Brown, the son, is stopping at the Raleigh Hotel, while his half-sister - ->?-A ?? UhMtt tTnnaa ITi-lonria 19 ICftlBVClCU aV VUO uuutvi. A&vuiavt -m. m of the wounded man continue to call at tbe hospital, but only a few of them are admitted to the sick room. Main ln-terest in the case centers at the house of detention, where Mrs. Bradley la a prisoner, now that the wounded man seems on the road to recovery. Mrs. Bradley Is still Interested In the condition of the patient, and many times during the day she inquires how he is getting along. "I do hope he will get well," she frequently remarks. She asked today regarding the location of the Emergency Hospital, and when told that It was just across the park from the house of detention she said: "Just to think that we are so near and I can't see him." hpp arpMt Mm. "Rrari'lev has re ceived many mt-ssages of sympathy from ' strangers as well as from people from Utah who are In the city. She received an anonymous letter this morning from a woman, who told her to cheer up and face any charge that might be made against her. The writer told her that If there were more brave women In the world there would not be so many robbed of honor and deserted. Prisoner in Splendid Condition. It was stated at the house of detention that Mrs. Bradley is in splendid condition. She enjoys her meals and takes what exercise she can in her cramped apartment. The woman reads the newspaper stories about her case, and some of them have greatly incensed her. "It is true that she walks the floor of her room," a friend said. "What else is ' *r?r hf?r to do in order to exer- i cise?" The police are not satisfying: the curiosity of those who are anxious to obtain a look at Mrs. Bradley, such callers at the house of detention being told that she cannot be j seen. Under the circumstances, Mrs. Bradley is well satisfied with her surroundings. She was somewhat annoyed this morning by a baby crying In the building, and she also heard the juveniles discussing their troubles, but even that was far better than her surroundings at the first precinct Saturday, where noisy drunken prisoners made the night hideous. The station cells were crowded Saturday night with the most boisterous crowd of prisoner* that had been there for several months. ftolng to Jail Distasteful. Mrs. Bradley, it Is said, does not relish the Idea of going to jail to await the result of the wound she Inflicted, and ahe may not nave 10 so snere. 11 wu me uuenugn of Inspector Boardman to have her go to court this morning, but the plan was abandoned because of a request made by Attorney Leckle. Inspector Boardman stated this afternoon that he did not know just when tha prisoner would be taken to oourt. He thought that counsel might apply for her release on bond as soon as the attending surgeons are able to say that the wounded man Is out of danger. Such a course. It is stated, is to be pursued by her attorneys, and Utah friends of the prisoner, it is believed, will furnish the bond that may be fixed by the court. Ho Knowledge of Parker. The police had not up to a late hour thia afternoon learne I anything concerning the whereabout* of John E.

CODIFYING WORK FINISHED Task of Ex-Representative Watson of Ohio and His Associates. THE FIGHT Iff OKLAHOMA Delegate Maguire Probably Shut Out From a Chance for United States Senator. President Roosevelt received many congratulations today on the award of the Nobel peace prize and the action taken by him in establishing a peace committee for the settlement of disputes between capital and labor. Telegrams and cable messages from all parts of the world, and the verbal felicitations of a number of callers added to- the interest of the day. King Haakon of Norway cabled the President as follows, from Sandrlngham. where he is visiting: "Accept my heartfelt congratulations on your receiving the Nobel prize." Baron d'Estournelle de Constant, the great advocate of International peace, wired the President from Paris: * Heartfelt congratulation. My wish Is realized." Representative Barthoidt of Missouri congratulated the President upoft the award and told him he had obtained the two greatest honors In all the world?the presidency of the United States and the Nobel prize. He could not possibly look*for anygreater honors In all the world?the precdcall of Dr. Bartholdt was especially pleasing, as the Mlssourlan, by reason of his work for international peace through the Interparliamentary Union, had been suggested by a number of persons for the prise. But for the greater prominence of the President as a peace arbiter. Dr. Bartholdt might have received the honor. Codifying Work Completed. Ex-Representative D. K. Watson, who Is a member of the codifying commission, was a White Hou9e caller. The commission Is winding up its work after about eight years of service. In that time it has codified and revised all the general laws enacted by Congress since the revised statutes were completed In 1878. The commission that re vised the laws at that time sat from 1873 to 1878. The number of laws of a general nature passed since 1878 have been twice as many as were passed during all the years of the existence of the government prior to that time. The commission in its report to Congress and the President this week will show that its work is embodied in two large volumes that contain a total of 9,000 sections of law. Mr. Watson by the conclusion of the work of the commission will be out of the federal service, unless appointed to a position by President Roosevelt. It is understood that the President has given consideration to the selection of Mr. Watson for some judicial place, but has made no announcement. The Oklahoma Fight. Delegate Maguire of Oklahoma called on the President today to pay his respects. It was the faithful work of Mr. Maguire that had much to do with the admission of Oklahoma and Indian Territory to statehood, and It was generally understood that he would fee the leading republican candidate for one of thM United States senatorshlpa trt Ka />nnfarroA Th o foot that tha w wwr- ' * ??v 'k?v?. v?ui ?**u v>u?#v crats badly defeated the republicans for delegates to the constitutional convention and will probably gerrymander the new state to give themselves control for a long time to come makes It extremely difficult whether Mr. Maguire will realize his ambitions. He admitted today that the prospects were none too good in Oklahoma from a republican view. The trouble. It Is asserted, is that thousands of the Indians in the Indian Territory became offended at certain rulings of Secretary Hitchcock and ' sulked at the polls, refusing to vote the republican ticket. Pure Food and Pure Drugs. Secretary Wilson toaay introduced w> tne President Dr. Alexander S. von Mansfelde of Ashland, Neb., who Is the chairman of the committee on pure food and pure drugs of the national legislative council of the American Medical Association. This com- ' mlttee meets In Washington on Thursday. Its functions are to advise Congress respecting the enactment of measures in which the people are Interested In a medical way. Senator Clark of Wyoming, who will soon retire from the Senate, leaving the. title of the richest man of that body to some one else, and Senator Patterson of Colorado paid their respects to the President today. Senator Lodge called on some business concerning a small appointment, and Senator Hopkins arranged for the President to see a delegation 01 oannera wno are here working for currency reform. Ambassadorial Changes. The President has filled the vacancy to be created toy the transfer to the cabinet of Ambassador Meyer at St. Petersburg by the selection of John W. Riddle, at present < minister to Roumania and Servla, whoso nomination probably will be sent to the Senate tomorrow. Mr. Riddle's appoint- ! ment is said to be In pursuance of the plan of the President and Secretary Root of applying civil service principles In relation to promotions to the diplomatic service, for , Mr. Riddle has really been In that service with one short gap since 1893, when he was appointed secretary of legation at Constantinople. He was afterward secretary of embassy at St. Petersburg, agent and consul general at Cairo, Egypt, and In March. 1005, toe was appointed to his present post of minister to Roumania and Ser- .

My Dear Mr. Secretary: I have just read thru the resume of the treasury operations during the five years that you have been Secretary. I am so imprest by this plain re- ! cital of what has been accomplished by you that I take this opportunity of telling yon so; and at thd same time of expressing my very profound appreciation of your services.

FORGAJTS ABGUMEHT : Sentiment Am one 8cn?tani Stwina On> posed to Immediate Legislation on the Subject. The currency commission of the American Bankers' Association appeared before the banking and currency committee of the House today In support of the elastic currency bill supported by the association. James B. Forgan of the First National Bank of Chicago and A. B. Hepburn of the Chase National Bank New York, were the principal speakers. If.

He said that the certified check Is the currency used by Wall street, and that the Issuance of additional bank notes as proposed by the association will not result In extending additional credit to Wall street Interests. Drain on the Banks. As an illustration of the great drain there is on banks at crop-moving time, Mr. Fortran said that the bank with which he la connected was called upon to ship 13,500.000 to western banks during the first seven days of last September. He urged the necessity for affording a more elastic currency to meet such emergencies, and explained that under the proposed bill a national bank with a capital of $100,000 will be permitted to Issue $25,000 - worth more of bank notes upon which It shall pay 2% per cent, and $12,500 worth more of bank notes, upon which the rate of Interest shall be 5 per cent. Representative Prince of Illinois inQuired If the tendency of such a measure will not be to encourage banks to keep their notes in circulation at 2ft per cent rather than pay a higher rate than that on deposits, but Mr. Forgan replied that he did not think such would be the case. . Winked at by Examiners. Representative Gillespie of Texas asked Mr. Forgan If It Is not true that national banks Include their bank notes In their reserve and thus limit the circulating medium. J^r. Forgan replied that he regretted to admit such is the case, and added that In the hearings of the commission it developed that in small cities, not In reserve cities, the banks do not separate their paper mAnAir X __?- - uivitcj xv/i uauiv cAaiumcrB, wno merely estimate how many bank notes there are in piles of bills and thus wink In a way at the use of bank notes for reserve. View of Some Senators. Currency legislation at the present session of Congress Is unlikely if a discussion held today in the Senate committee on finance may be taken as an indication. The committee spent considerable time in talking of the necessity of currency legislation, but did not have before It any of the sev- : eral bills which have been advocated for passage at this session. The sentiment. It is said, is opposed to the hurried passage of a bill such as might result if a measure 1 were pressed at a short session of Congress. 

RECEPTION WILL BE WABK. Congressional Committee Annoyed by Dr. Chancellor's Absence. The District of Columbia subcommittee of the House appropriation committee spent considerable time this afternoon, when it should have been attending to business. In waiting for Superintendent Chancellor of the public schools to show up at the Capitol and ebplaln the school estimates submitted to Congress for the fiscal year 1908. Dr. Chancellor was expected back In Washington yesterday. Chairman Gillette ?f the District subcommittee was informed of this fact, and formally requested Dr. Chancellor's appearance yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock. The doctor did not show up, and It waa explained to the subcommittee over the 'phone from the Franklin building that the doctor would not arrive in Washington until this morning. So another notice was ckoiwus LuaL iiq appear ireiure me BUD* committee at 2 o'clock this afternoon. Up to the time The Star's report closed the doctor had not appeared, but the subcom- i mittee absolutely declined to wait any 1 longer, and so Mr. William V. Cox of the board of education was hurriedly summoned from the room of the committee on banking and currency, where he was about to be heard by that committee. Mr. Cox found there wasn't anybody else to submit the school estimates to the subcommittee and so he undertook the job. Assistant Superintendent of Schools Percy Hughes and former Superintendent -of Schools Stuart, who Is now superintendent of intermediate Instruction, were quickly summoned to the Capitol to answer any questions that might stagger Mr. Cox, and Dr. Everman of the board of education came along to help out in whatever way he could. All of these gentlemen appeared somewhat amazed at Superintendent Chancel- 1 lor's absence from the city today, and his I non-appearance before the committee the ' oa/iAn /I tima Knf thair wama > uvwuu kiiUG, UUV ncio UlOUCk anu < would not discuss the matter. I The members of the subcommittee did 1 not go to much trouble to hide their annoyance. They had evidently had quoted to 1 them some of Dr. Chancellor's expressions 1 concerning his independence of Congress, i and It looks as if the doctor might get a I warm and cordial reception when he does i ippear, if he finally makes up his mind to 1 do so. ' This afternoon, however, the subcom- 1 mlttee Is going along as best it can with- t out him, Mr. Cox submitting: the estimates and former Superintendent Stuart doing most of the explaining when explaining happens to be necessary. The committee has heard nothing from Dr. Chancellor and has no Idea when he may decide to come back to Washington. DEMAND FOB SHALL BILLS. Shortage la Causing: Bank Officials Trouble. The toller of a local bank declared this morning that any person who could furnish to the New York banks $1,000,000 In one- t lollar bills could make 1 per cent on the c money. The shortage of these small Mils t Is causing great trouble to bank officials, 1 those whose banking houses are within a { tone's throw of the treasury suffering as g much as those In cities a thousand miles < From Washington.

The telegram says that crops cannot be shipped to market, and there may be great loss to the cotton, fruit 1 and vegetable grower* in the south.

HOST PROSPEROUS YEAR In History of the Island Was Last Tear?Government Especially vwmiiivuuvm I The President today sent the following special message to Congress: To the Senate and House of Representatives: On November 21 I visited the island of Porto Rico, landing at Ponce, crossing by the old Spanish road by Cayey to San Juan, and returning next morning over the new American road from Arecibo to Ponce; the scenery was wonderfully beautiful, especially among the mountains of the Interior, which constitute a veritable tropic Switzerland. I could not embark at San Juan because the harbor has not been dredged out and cannot rfeceive an American battleship. I do not think this fact creditable to us as a nation, and I earnestly hope that Immediate provision will be made for dredging San Juan harbor. I doubt whether our people as a whole realize the beauty and fertility of Porto Rico, and the progress that has been made under Its admirable government. We have Just cause for pride In the character of our representatives who have administered the tropic island which came under our flag as a f>aai>1 f A# f Via tir i ? mi V? flnaln n ? nn a vl Liiu n ui n 11.11 upaiu, auu ui iiw one of them Is this more true than of Porto Rico. It would be Impossible to wish a more faithful, a more efficient and a more disinterested public service than that now being' rendered In the Island of Porto Rico by those in control of the Insular government. I stopped at a dozen towns all told, and one of the notable features In every town was the gathering of the school children. The work that has been done In Porto Rico for education has been noteworthy. The main emphasis, as Is eminently wise and piupri, lias urcu put upun j/i iinai j tlon; but In addition to this there Is a normal school, an agricultural school, three Industrial and three high schools. Every effort Is being made to secure not only the benefits of elementary education to all the Porto Blcans o'f the next generation, but also as far as means will permit to train them so that the Industrial, agricultural and commercial opportunities of the Island can be utilized to the best possible advantage. It was evident at a glance that the , teachers, both Americans and native Porto , Ricans, were devoted to their work, took ' the greatest pride In It. and were endeavoring to train their pupils, not only in mind, but in what counts for far more than mind < in citizenship, that Is, In character. , I was very much struck by the excellent character both of the Insular police and of the Porto Rlcan regiment They are both 1 of them bodies that reflect credit upon the American administration of the Island. The 1 Insular police are tinder th? local Porto Rlcan government. The Porto Rlcan regiment of troops must be appropriated for by the Congress. I earnestly 1 hope that thla body will be kept perma- ' nent. There should certainly be troops In ] the Island, and It Is wise that these troops Bhoutd be themselves native Porto Rlcans. ' It would be from every standpoint a mis- ' take not to perpetuate this regiment. ; Host Prosperous Tear. In traversing the Island even the most cursory survey leaves the beholder struck , with the evident rapid growth in the culture both of the sugar cane and tobacco, i ^ . _ ? The fruit Industry is also growing. Last year was the most prosperous year that the ! island has ever known before or since the ] American occupation. The total of exports ( and Imports of the island was forty-flve . millions of dollars as against eighteen millions in 1901. This is the largest in the Island's history. Prior to the American occupation the greatest trade for any one year was that of 1896, when it reached nearly $23,000,000. Last year, therefore, there was double the trade that there was in the most prosperous year under the Spanish regime.. There were 210,273 tons of sugar exported last year, of the value of 1 $14,180,319; $3,555,163 or tobacco ana 322 pounds of coffee of the value of $3,481,102. Unfortunately, what used to be Porto , Rico's prime cup?coffee?has not shared this prosperity. It has never recovered from the disaster of the hurricane, and moreover, the benefit of throwing open our market to It has not compensated for the loss Inflicted by the closing of the markets to it abroad. I call your attention to the accompanying memorial on this subject of the board of trade of San Juan, and I earnestly hope that some measure will be taken for the benefit of the excellent and high grade Porto Rlcan coffee.

There is a matter to which I wish to call four special attention, and that is the desirability ef conferring full American citizenship upon the people of Porto Rico. I most earnestly hope that this will be done. [ cannot see how any harm can possibly result from it, and it seems to me a matter at right and Justice to the people of Porto Rico. They are loyal, they are glad to be under our flag, they are making rapid progress along the path of orderly liberty. Surely we should show our appreciation of them, our pride In what they have done, md our pleasure in extending recognition tor what has thus been done, by granting them full American citizenship. Under the wise administration of the present governor and council marked %?>n(rvAaa Via? Hoon marfa in thA dlfflrailt natter of granting to the people of the sland the largest measure of self-governxtent that can with: safety be given at the ^resent time. It would have been a very lerlous mistake to have gone any faster :han we have already gone in this direc:ion. The Porto Rlc&ns have complete and ibsolute autonomy In all their municipal fovernments, the only power over them >ossessed by the insular government being hat of removing: corrupt or incompneni 1 nunlcipal officials. This power has never t >een exercised save on the clearest proof t if corruption or of incompetence?such as 1 o jeopardize the interests of the people of i his land, and under such circumstances it c ias been fearlessly used to the Immense i >ei*eflt of the people. It Is not a power vith which It would be safe, for the sake if the Island Itself, to dispense at present Che lower house Is absolutely elective, rhlle the upper house la appointive. This ] icheme Is working well; no injustice of any clnd results from It, and great benefit to he Island, and It should certainly not be hanged at this time. The machinery of . he elections Is administered entirely by 3 he Porto Rlcan people themselves, the gov- ? irnor and council keeping only such sulervislon as Is necessary in order to Inure an orderly election. Any protest as to s Sectoral frauds is settled in the courts. e Not Safe to Xake Any Change. t Here, again, it would not be safe to malm my chance in the present system. The lections this year were absolutely orderly, inaccompanlext by any disturbance, and no ^ irotest has been made against the manage- ^ nent of the elections, although three con eats are threatened where the' majorities j fere very Small and error was claimed; t he contests, of course, to be settled in the ourta. In short, the governor and council ire co-opera tin* with all of the most enightened and most patriotic of the people if Porto Rico in educating the eitisens of he island in the principles of orderly lib- Q rty. They are providing a governmeat 1 laaod upon each citizen's self-respect and I he mutual respect of all cltlsens?that Is, c lased upon a rigid observance of the prln- C lples of Justice and honesty. It has not b wen easy to instill into the minds of the d ieople iinsocmrtoniod to the exercise of G :n, # ? % freedom the two h?slc principles of our American system?the principle that the majority must rule an<l the principle that the minority has rights which must not bo disregarded or trampled upon Yet real progress" has been made In having these principles accepted as elementary, as the foundations of successful self-government I transmit herewith the report of the governor of Porto Rico, sent to the President through the Secretary of State. w All the Insular governments should be DlArerf In one hurenti nilhpr In thn ment of War or the Department of Slate. It U a mistake not bo to arrange our handling of these island at Washington as to be able to take advantage of the experience gained In one when dealing with the problems that from time to time ariae In another. In conclusion let me express my admiration for the work done by the Congress when It enacted the law under which the Island la now being administered. After Being the taland personally, and after five year*' experience In connection with lta administration. It la but fair to those who devtsed thla law to say that It would be well-nigh Impossible to have devised any * other which In the actual working would nave accompnsnea oetter results. 

THEODORE ROOSEVELT. The White House, December 11, 1900. OPPOSITION TO BONAPARTE. Claimed That He Opposed Trust Regulation In 1899. Opposition to Charles J. Bonaparte as Attorney General prevented the confirmation of William H. Moody as associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States when his nomination was called up yesterday In executive session of the Senate. The nhiprtinn tn Mr nnnanflrt? ? ?? K?* a speech made by him In Chicago In September. 1889, before the conference held there to consider the trust question. In that speech Mr. Bonaparte declared that legislative action In regulation or restraint of combinations was undesirable. When the Moody nomination was p/aced before the Senate yesterday afternoon Senator Culberson called attention to the fact that the position he is to vacate will be filled by Mr. Bonaparte, and he then read extracts from the Chicago speech In support of an argument that Mr. Bonaparte is not qualified to take the responsibility of enforcing anti-trust laws. Senator Knox, formerly Attorney General, saia iimi ne naa lamea wjui air. tc, and had found him thoroughly in sympathy with the administration In breaking up combinations of capital which operate 1n restraint of trade. He also remarked that probably there were men In the Senate x chamber whose minds had not undergone some decided changes on many great questions since 18SH), when conditions were far ? different from what they are today. Senator Rayner started to reply to this speech, when Vice President Fairbanks ooserved that the nomination before the Senate waa that of Mr. Moody and not Mr. Bonaparte. This had the effect of curtailing the speechmaking, but Senator TeHer said that It was customary for all nominations to go over one day after being reported from committees, and he therefore objected to further consideration. 

HIGH PRICE OF LUMBER. Mr. Miller's Resolution for Investl Mnn +ti? Cmini. B"""6 Representative Miller of Kansas has Introduced a resolution In the House requesting the Secretary of Commerce and Labor to Investigate the cause of the high price of lumber in its various stages of manufacture, and with the particular aim of discovering whether these high prices are due to the control of the lumber trade by a trust or combination of capital. Mr. Miller said today, in discussing his resolution: "For ths last three years lumber has advanced by regular steps at an asiounuing rate in the southwest, where no much development Is going on. Lumber has advanced from $5 to $10 per thousand a year, so that common lumber costs as much today as the best dressed lumber did four years ago. This Is the result sf a number of combines all acting with Dne common purpose, although having no ' mmediate connection. The greatest of " these Is the Yellow Pine Manufacturers' Association of 8t. Ix>uta. This combine fixes the price on the greatest mill output In the United States; controls all mills In Mississippi, Arkansas. Alabama. Louisiana and Texas. This concern also operates In absolute defiance of the antitrust laws of Arkansas. "In Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma ind western Texas, where thousands of people want to build homes, this grinding combine has practically held up the development of this splendid country. And I propose to do whatever is In my power to give the people rener irom mm ?rranlied system of robbery." TO TAX INHERITANCES. Bill Urged In the House by Mr. Perkins. ?r Representative Perkins of New York, the J original inheritance tax man, delivered m speeoh In the House of Representative* this afternoon, urging the passage of a law on the subject. "Unless the Supreme Court should change Its views," said Mr. Perkins, "there seems .10 question that the general government nay constitutionally Impose an inheritance tax. The Supreme Court has been known to :hange Its views, but I am Inclined to think It would be more apt to reverse Its final decision on the Income tax, and again hold, is it formerly held, that such a tax was constitutional, than to reverse Itself on the nherltance tax and hold that unconstitu.ional. "If the validity of such a tax can be esablished by long acquiescence, certainly :hls has been done. In 1797 an Inheritance ax was imposed by this government. The aw received the approval of George Wash ??- *. - u rrk? ngrton ana ills name was set iu n.. inn validity of this law was never questioned uid a few years later the act was repealed. "In the hour of need of the civil war the government again imposed an inheritance :ax. Its constitutionality was questioned out it was affirmed. "An inheritance tax and a progressive lnleritance tax were imposed in the Spanish war. The court unanimously held that a progressive inheritance tax was constitutionlily imposed. Tllie court said this was not a luty imposed on property, real or personal: that It was not subject to the rea Boning by which an Income tax haa Deen ieclared unconstitutional. "Inheritance taxes have for some time Seen imposed by most European countries. Dure Is now the only great power In which no Imposition of this kind is imposed by the general government. It has, however, nrlthln recent years, been established In most of the states. There are now Inheritance taxes In thirty states or more. "The form legislation will take we caniot now say, but legislation of this kind a a sure product of the future. It will >enefit the state. It will assist in the solu:lon of social problems. It will not check :he development of enterprise or the desire o acquire wealth on the part of the Individual, It will lessen some of the evils of >ur present condition, It will harm none ind help all."
