Not content with robbing their vic tims of their valuables, the convicts assaulted two of the passengers and tired a shot in an attempt to kill' Motorman Kiel B. Richards, then drove him from his cab and one of the motly crew took hold of the con trollor and operated the car as skill fully as any veteran motorman.

President Wilson In his address to congress recommended an immediate declaration of . war, on Austria-Hungary,' So far as "Turkey and Bulgaria are concerned the president said that they were merely tools of Germany and a declaration of war is not need ed at this time. THE 

MESSAGE. The following is President Wilson's address In part: "Gentlemen of Congress: Six months have elapsed since I last had the honor of addressing you. "They have been months with ev ents of grave significance for us. 1 shall not undertake to detail or even summarize them. The practical par ticulars of the part we have played in them will be laid before you in the reports of the executive depart ment. "I shall discuss only our present outlook upon these vast affairs, our present duties and the immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always in view. "1 shall not go back to the causes of the war. These Intolerable wrongs done and planned against us by the sinister master of Germany have long been too grossly obvious and odius to every true American to need to be re hearsed. "Uut I shall ask you to consider again and with a very grave scrutiny your objectives in the measures by which we mean to attain them; for the purposo of discussing here in this place and our definite ends. Our ob ject is, of course, to win the war; and we shall not flatter or suffer our selves to be diverted until it is won. But It is worth while asking and ans wering the question, 'When shall we cousider the war won?' "Prom one point of view It is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that tho Am erlcan people know what the war is about and what sort of an outcome . they will regard as a realization of their purpose 4n It. As a nation we are united in spirit and In person. 1 pay little heed to those who tell mc otherwise. I hear the voices of dis sent, who does not? I hear the critl oIbiii and the clamor of the noisy thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men hero and there fling them selves in impotent disloyalty against the calm, Indomlnable cause of the na tion. I hear men deface my peace, who understand neither Its nature nor the ways is which we obtain it, with confident eyes and unbroken spirit. But 1 know that none of these speak for the nation. "They do not touch the heart of in nocenBe. They may be safely lead to state their uneasy hour and be for gotten. But from another point of view I believe that It Is necessary to say plainly that we here at the seat of action, consider the war to be for and what purt wo mean to play In quitted himself of every duty he had accepted and to which he willingly dnvcied, every energy at his command for the glorious cause of God in his high office for the salvation of souls. The preacher showed the great loy alty of the late Father to the cause of God by the evident surviving monument in the splendid church parish building he left behind him, in the great religious and moral monu ments of enduring piety and devo tion Ife has nurtured in his great charge the love of truth and charity which he ever instilled into all heart? with whom ho came 'in contact; hi splendid patriotism and love of coun try with love of God and souls, likv.1 the True Master, a pastor, a leader, a guide and a father whose memo; shall last forever in the splendid and cnnsDling work of this priest. Father Conway congratulated the people of St. Patrick's, Ottawa, in the! appointment of the successor to Father Quirk in the person of the Rev. Father Hackett, a close friend and admirer of Father Quirk for many years and one who would keep the memory of Father Quirk fresh and lasting as a worthy successor and a worthy pastor who would lead them as the devnled Father Quirk led them in all the way of God under his gen ie administration.
