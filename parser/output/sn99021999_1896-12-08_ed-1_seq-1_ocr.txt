I WASHINGTON , Dec. 7. The United States ocnato began the second session ot the Fifty- fourth congress with crowded galleries and with that accompaniment of activity and of greeting that usually attends the reasoem- blIng ot congrcrs. But the upper branch ot congress never puta nsldo Its dignity and the meeting developed no demonstration ! ) of dramatic Incidents. The reading of the pri Idcnt's mcs9igo was the feature of the pro ceedings nnd , beyond this , no attempt wat < made to enter upon the business of the set' slon.

The diplo matic gallery was vacated at' soon as the for eign questions referred to In the message had been road. On the Hour of the senate printed copies of the mcssago were distrib uted , and thesa gave the senators opportunity to read the oillcr.t features Instead of listen Ing to them.

The reading of the message covered one hour and fifty minutes and at Itu conclusion the senate adjourned.

The read ing consumed about two hours. It was Mr. Cleveland's farewell message , and there vvaa much curiosity as to his views , on Cuba especially , but there was no demon stration , cither of approval or dissent , throughout Its reading. The holiday nature of the day was saddened by the announce ment of the denth of ex-Speaker Crisp , which Mr. Turner of Georgia formally made to his associates. Out of respect to the memory of the distinguished Georgian , the house , after adopting appropriate resolu tions , immediately adjourned. The house presented n very ani mated scene for an hour before Speaker Rood appeared. Tlio pal- lerlcs , to which the public was admitted vslthout cards , wcro crowded to the doois before 11 o'clock , whllo the halls were jammed with those unable to gain entrance. The reserved galleries filled moro slowly , but before 12 o'clock were brightened with handsome gowns of fair women.

Mr Cowdcr of Michigan , the blind chaplain of the house , offered the Invocation. His nrayor wns simple but Impressive. When It vins finished the speaker ordered the clerk to cal the roll.

J W. M. Stokes was then sworn In ns a mcnv.- ber from the Seventh district of South Care lina. The credentials of Charles J. Boatncr from the Fifth district of Louisiana were reid also. Both of these gentlemen recelvet certificates of election to this congress , bui their scats were contested and declared vacant by the huusp at the last session. They were then re-elected.

Mr. Cannon. Mr. Payne and Mr Turner wore appointed on the committee The selection of Mr. Turner was considered a significant Indication that the Georgia mem her would succeed ex-Speaker Crisp ns a member of the committee on rules , as It was a formal recognition of him as the leader on the democratic side. In order to await the president's mcroigo the house on motion o Mr.-Henderson of Iowa-took a recess until 1:30. 1:30.When When the house reassembled the mcssago was read. The opening words , congratulat ing the country on the result of the elec tion , created a broad smile , the democrats as well as the republicans seeming Jolt In the political condition which allowei a democratic president to felicitate upot a victory gained under the banner of the republican party. The president's cxprcs slons upon Cuba and Venezuela were 11s tcncd to attentively , but thcro wcro no dcm onstratlons even when he announced thai the administration some months ago hai suggested home rule for Cuba to Spain , or when ho announced the termination of the controvcny between Great Britain and the United States over the Venezuelan boundary line. line.Thcro was not much Interest In the re maindcr of the message , except these per lions relating to the tariff , the currency and the trusts. The reading of the message occupied ono hour and forty minutes. A Us conclusion , on motion of Mr. Dlngley republican of Maine , the mcssago and ac companylng documents wcro referred to the committee of the whole on the state of the union. Mr. Grow , republican of Pennsyl vania , showed a disposition to debate the message , but yielded until a later time. Mr. Turner , democrat of Georgia , then In formally announced the "untimely death" of his late collcage , ex-Speaker Crisp , and stated that at some future day lie would nsk the house to fix a day for paying trib ute "to his distinguished character and em inent public service. " A resolution pre sented by him reciting that the house had heard with profound regret the announce ment of Mr. Crisp's death , was adopted , after which , at 3:45 : p. m. , us n further mark ot respect , the house immediately adjourned until tomorrow.

For the first time within the memory of oldest officials , the secretary of state has made a regular report to the president for transmission to congress , like the reports ot other olllcers of the cabinet. This report was laid before congress today as an appendix to the presi dent's message. It treats on many details of our relationships during the past year with foreign go\crnmcnts that cither wcic not touched upon at all In the message or were more briefly treated. Under the head of Spain , Secretary Olncy has much to say In regard to Cuba , and In his report he sets out in great detail the story of the growth of the rebellion , the present c\II state of affalra on the Island and other facts upon which the president bases his broad statement and conclusions No reference Is made to a rcbort from Con sul General Lee , but the secretary Inti mates that his Information comes prin cipally from the United States consul , and so must be regarded as confidential as to Its source. The secretary's estimate of the present situation U disclosed In the following para graph , made after a preliminary statement of the destruction of the Industrial resources of Cuba. "From whatever point of view wo regard the matter. It is impossible not to discern that a state of things exists at our doors alike dangerous to good relations , destructive of legitimate commerce , fatal to the Internal resources of Cuba , nnd most vexatious and trying because entailing upon this government excessive burdens In Us domestic administration and In Its outward relations. This situation cannot Indefinitely continue without growing fitlll worse and the time may not be far distant when the United States must seiiously consider Its rights and Interests , as well as Its International duties. If , Indeed. Its public relations to the hland do not call for some decided change In the policy hitherto pursued. " To begin with , the secretary makca It plain that the present Insurrection Is far more formidable than the famous "len- > oar Insurrection" which began at Yara In 1S6S Ho fiajs that starling la the same portion of thu Island , it very early took proportions beyond ls ! predecessor nnd assumed thr- ag gressive phase. Passing the defensive lines of the trochas , traversing the Island from north nnd south , formidable bodlm of the revolutionary forces early In the > ear estab lished sugar planting districts In Santa Clara nnd Clenfucgra , inido hostile forajn almost In sight of Havana Itself and advanc ing westward affected a lodgment In the fertile tobacco fields of I'iuar Del Illo. which liati so far resisted all efforts of the Spanish forces to overcome. 

STRENGTH OF THE INSURGENTS. The wc-otary sajs that whl o no promlnint seaport has been attacked by the insurgents a large partof 2,200 miles of x'cacoaat Is practically in their hando , and from its rugged and wild character Is peculiarly fitted for guerrilla warfare and affonla easy means of landing clandestine supplies of men and arms.c-.TUo secretary adds. : . , "Whllo thus in fact controlling the largo part ot the Island of Culm from Cape San Antonio to Cnpo Mnlsl , and enjoying practl- cally unhindered a largo part of the coast , the revolutionary forces are scattered , never being united for a length of time necessary ( o fonn an army capable of attack or siege and fit to toke the defensive In a pitched battle. Assembling suddenly at n given point , often In o single night , they make unexpected Falllco or carry destruction to the tobacco and cano Holds of Cuba , nnd at the first sign of pursuit or organized assault they disperse only to assemble In llko man- rer at some other spot. " As bearing upon the question of recog nition of the Insurconts. which is to como up in some shape before congress , the fol lowing statement from Mr. Gluey Is of Importance In explaining his reasons for declining recognition. "So far as our In formation shows thcro Is not only no f > f- fcctlvo local government by the Insurgents In the territory they overrun , but there Is not even a tangible pretense to estab lish an administration anywhere. Their organization is confined to .ihlftlng exi gencies of military operations of 'he hour , h nomadic , without definite centers , and lacking the most elementary features of municipal government. There nowhere ap pears the nucleus of statehood. The ma chinery of the exercising of legitimate rights and powers of sovereignty arid ic- spondlng to the obligations which do facto sovereignty entails In the face of equal rights of other states. Is conspicuously lacking. It Is not possibleto discern n homogenous political entity , possessing and exercising the functions of admlnlstritlon nnd capable , if left to Itself , of maln.-ain- Ing orderly government In its own terri tory nnd biistainlng moral rclallo-is with the external family of governments. " NOT ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE. Ho illustrates his point as to the Irre sponsibility of the Insurgents by citing their destruction of American plant.itlons and oppression of American plantcis vho grind cane , which ho characterl/.cs H acts of anarchy. On the other hand , he bhows that In the capital cities and soaportb nnd all parts of the Island , with which the United States or Its citizens maintain legiti mate normal Intercourse , the Spanish power Is supreme , though often oxerclscd In a vexatious and arbitrary way , calling for Just remonstrance , and that most of the functions of government proceed on In time of peace. Referring to his compari son of this insurrection with these that Iiavo preceded It. Secretary Olncy makes this BlEiilflcnnt statement : Krom every accessible Indication it Is clour tht ) piccent rebellion Is on u fur moro foimld.iblo scale < IH to ninnbeiH , In telligence and reprcreiittitlve fentiireH than any of thn piccedlng revolts of tblH ccn- Itiiv ; that the corresponding effort of Spain for Itu mipprenslon lmi : been enor mously augmented , and that , despllo the constant Influx , of fresh armies nnd in itrrlal of war from the mettopollH , the rebellion , after nearly two years of Hucrciisfiil re- HlHtanco. appftirs today to lie In n condition lo Indollnltoly prolong the contest on Its present lines. He also compliments the tactical skill ill- ) played by the leaders of the Insurrection , saying that when the disparity of numlicu and ( lie comparatively Indefensible charac ter of the central and western vega country are considered , the passage of a consldeia- blo force to 1'inar del Rio , followed by ltd successful maintenance there for many months , must be regarded a.s a military uc- tcss of a pronounced character. Tl o secretary speiiks of the appalling phases of the struggle such na often appear In contests among the Latin races of the western hemisphere , of the- excesses nnd forceful and arbitrary acts of the military , of the ravaging of private property , the violation of principles ot civilized war by Irresponsible officials , and .tho killing of noiicombatants.

That part of the report drvoted to Cuba concludes with a brief statement ot the Comr B case , which , it appears , has now bej Btianded by the Madrid authorities for Rl , and a state ment of the dissentj B ° State depart ment from the requln HBI of the governor general ot Cuba that all aliens In Cuba shall be registered within a certain time under pain of disbarment from the protec tion of law. 

SAYS LITTLE ON VENEZUELA. Secretary Olncy says very llttlo more than does the president in his message rcbpectlng the Vcncjuelan boundary ques tion. Ho announces with gratification that amicable counsels lm\o prevailed to Induce a satisfactory result of the attempts at an understanding and that the boundary ques tion nnd Its associated phases have been at last eliminated as between this country nnd England. He gives , however , no Ink ling of the nature of the treaty beyond the statement that It provides for honorable ar bitration of the whole controversy. Ho adds "No doubt Is entertained that Ven ezuela , which has so earnestly sought the friendly assistance of the United States to ward settlement of this vexntlous con tention and which hns unreservedly confided Its Interests to the Impartial Judgment of this govcrnmnnt , will assent to the formal adjustment thus attained , tints forever endIng - Ing n dispute Involving far-renching con sequences to the peace nnd welfare of the western continent. " Toiuhlng the negotiations for a general arbitration ttcaty for the settlement of all futuio disputes between the United States nnd Gerat llrltaln , Secretary Olnny snjs that both countries having given repeated proof nf tl elr acquiescence In the great principle Involved , not only by treaties be tween themselves but severally by conclud ing like adjustments with other powers for the adjudication of disputes resting on law nnd fact , the subject was naturally approached preached In n benevolent spirit of ngrcp- ment , and the negotiations have so satls- factoilly pioprcsscd na to foreshadow a practical ngtcement at an early date upon the text of n convention to the desired end. The secretary expresses regret that the Drltlsh government has refused Its concurrence In a proposed International commission to dc- vlso means of protecting the seal herds , recites the finding of the experts , In effect showing that the herd Is threatened with total destruction unless ch-uiges are made speedily In the award regulations , and hopca that the experts' icport will Induce the nrltlah government to agree unon these changes.

GERMANY'S MEAT EXCLUSION. Under the head of Germany , the report treats briefly of the exclusion from that country of American meat products. The Hltuntloji apparently remains unchanged and there has been no amelioration of the stringent menbtircs adopted by Germany "on assumed grounds of public health" against our cattle. "On the contrary , " savs tho- secretary , "tho disposition of Germany , visible for a number of years past , to still further Impede and virtually Inhibit this legitimate traffic Is evidenced by fresh rcstilctlvc measures. The un- justlflablllty nnd the erroneousness of the supposed prcmiscH on which they rest have been again pointed out and the heulthful- ncss ot our exports supported by amply conclusive proof. " The secretary says thcro are fair prospects ot tbo ultimata removal ofthe Interdiction upon American life Insurance companies seeking lo do bus iness la Gojmany , 'The subjoet of the ro- Imposltlon of tonnage dues on German vessels is discussed compactly , to show that the law was mandatory upon the pres ident to issue his proclamation , as soon as the facts were established. Hawaii comes in for A single short para graph In the report , stating tbnt no ques tions of Importance have arisen , that a few claims for Indemnity hsve been filed In behalf of United States citizens arrested during the last rebellion , and that the final chapter in the history of that attempted icvolt was reached in the pardon of the ex- queen. Samoa Is also briefly treated , the situa tion being unchanged , nnd the United States necessarily continuing to exercise all stipu lated rights nnd duties under the tripartite general act of Ilerlln , "during the continu ance of the compact , however irksome nnd unnatural these rights and duties may prove to be. " It Is Indicated that the United States will appoint a successor to Chief Justice Ido , who resigned. An explanation of the dlfllcultlcs that arli'o In connection with the effort to protect United States naturalized cltlrens. usually Jews , who return to Russia Is afforded by the fol lowing paragraph"Holding to the old doc trine of perpetual allegiance ; refusing to lessen Its authority by concluding any treaty recognizing the naturalization of a Russian subject without Imperial consent ; asserting the extreme right to punish a naturalized Ruroian on return to hl native Jurisdiction , not merely for unauthorized emigration , but also specifically for the unpermlttcd acquisi tion of n foreign citizenship ; and sedulously applying , at homo and through the official acts of HH agents abroad to all persons of the Jewish belief , the stern restrictions enjoined by Rurslan law , the government of Russia takeii ground not admitting of acquiescence by the United States , because at variance with the character of our Institutions , the senti ments of our people , the provisions of our statutes and the tendencies of modern Inter national comity. " Nevertheless , the secre tary saye the differences that nrlpo are com promised In worthy cares by the friendly dis position of Russia toward our country. MATTERS TOUCHED ON HRIEFLY. Other points In the report may bo briefly summarized as follows : "The Argentine gov ernment has tx3ttled the Halo claim by offerIng - Ing to pay an Indemnity ; arrests of naturalised Americans returning to Austria are becoming less * frequent ; efforts continue for the removal - moval cf restrictions on the Importation of American cattle into Helglum ; there are pros pects of a tpecdy conclusion of arrangements for tlic completion of the work left nnflnlihcd by the Chilian claims commission of IS'JI ; the Chincjo government has settled all cUlnm of Amerlcani ) for loss through the anti-foreign rlott' , and It Is expected that that government will soon concent to a formal recognition of the rlghtu of American mlMlonarkv- ) and teachers to full protection In their work and property ; the claim of Julio Santos against Ecuador , standing for a quarter of a century , has been e.ttled directly between the parties en the eve of arbitration ; the French govern ment has promised the fullest extension to American cltlzcna and Interests In Madagas car of nil rights under pre-unt treaties be tween Franco and the United States , K > our consuls In Madagascar are relinquishing extraterritorial tra-territorial JurUJIctlon ; It Ik suggested that our minister resident at Ilaytl and Santo Do mingo bo raised to the grade of plenipoten tiary ; the Italian government is stopped from claiming Indemnity for the Italians killed at Hahnvllle , La. , last Juno by reason of the fact that they had voted In Mate elections and to abandoned their Italian citizenship ; an extension for ono year of tlio functions of the Mexican boundary commission In order to al low It to pans upon Important ltuue of Irri gation and utorago dams on the Rio Grande river l noted ; the Peruvian Kovcrnmi'iit 1ms settled the clilm of certain citizens employed on a hydrogruphlc commission by the pay ment of 20,000 t les ; a naturalization treaty lu to bo negotiated with Switzerland , which has eo far refuted to admit the rig t of expatriation to Its cltlzcna ; extradition treaties have been concluded with Argentine and the Orange Tree State and will bo tub- mlttod to the senate , tlmatc-s have been collected of the cost of acquiring miltnblo buildings for the permanent occupancy of each ot our umbatuics and legations abroad : and a moro commodious building t'pccUlly de signed for the ncoda of the State department i rccammcnded.
