THE DEMOCRAT. Mineral Point, Friday, Dec. 18, 1885. Oeo. Crawford, Robt. M. Crawford, EDITOEfi AND EEOPEIETOES. The December number of the Wisconsin Journal of Education contains an excellent article on “Our ‘News of the Week,’” by .1, W. Livingston, principal of the Dodgeville high school. Congressman Cass well, of the first district of this state has prepared a bill imposing a uniform duty of seventy-five per cent, on all foreign tobacco. The present duty is sventy-five per cent, on wrappers and thirty-five per cent, on other grades. The French are coming to their senses on the meat question. It is said that a resolution abolishing the prohibitory duties upon Amer ican preserved meats will soon be Introduced in the chamber of dep uties. If the Frenchmen know what is for their own interest the resolution will cairy. On account of the adoption of a new code of rules the lower house of congress is rather slow in getting down to business; but when that matter is settled work will probably go ahead at a lively rate, as there are many important matters to come up for consideration, and there seems to he a determination on the part of both house and sen ate to expedite business. The ease of Angus Cannon, a Mormon convicted in the supreme court of I tali, under the Edmunds law, was appealetl to the supreme court of the I ’nited States, and a decision was rendered on Monday, affirming the judgment of the lower court. This is the hardest blow that niormonisrn has yet re ceived in the courts, and it is thought will render it impossible for those guilty of polygamy to escape. In Lite electoral contests in (iroat Britain and Ireland the. liberals have secured a large plurality over the conservatives; hut as the Irish nation alists have secured something over eighty members, it is hardly prob able that the liberals will have a majority over both conservatives and nationalists. Hf they should have a majority at all it will be too small to make it safe for the liberals to lake office, and depend upon their own strength alone for support. A coalition between the liberals and nationalists is now strongly talked of, and Mr. (Jlad stono seems disposed to make such concessions to Mr. Parnell as will secure his support. It now seems that through the assistance of the liberals Ireland may obtain in some measure at least, the relief demanded. It is far more likely to come from this source than from the lories. Secretary Manning who was claimed by the protectionists as one of their own, turns out to be far from befuddled on the question of import duties. Ho is not in lavoi of tariff tinkering; but would rather have the present much tinkered taiiiV laws repealed, and more ex plicit and reasonable statutes enact ed in their stead. Ho takes no stock in the sonsless cry of “pauper labor,” and recognizes the fact that “the higher wages of American labor are at once the secret and the scourit}’ of our capacity to distance all com petition from ‘pauper labor’ in any market." He favors a material re duction of import duties, and con siders the pretence of tax payers for duties upon articles not produced in this country justifiable, and would have raw materials placed upon the free list. Surely the ad vocates of the spoliation system have indeed caught a tartar in the Hon. Daniel Manning. He promises to be one of the most effectual workers in the cause of tariff reform. THE 

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. Very few newspapers of the country have ventured an adverse criticism upon President Cleveland's message to congress, which is genar ally regarded as being one of the ablest state papers ever written. The Now York Post (independent) says: it I* not often (hat President* message gets, much praise both at home and abroad as has been bestowed on President rieteland’s. * * j The theory that Mr. Cleveland was weak and would be inspired by others has evidently been abandoned. No state paper produced in this . c ountry since Lincoln’s death has contained so , many evidences as President Cleveland's of liar- ! in; *’ a man behind the pen." The New York Tribune, which before his election to the Presidency | could see no good in Mr. Cleveland,] criticises the message very favorably,] and says: The first message of the president is a credit able one. On some of the most important questions of which it treats it deserves hearty praise. • • The president's argument for the suppression of silver coinage is earnest, strong, and convincing. Criticism of Hs details is needless; Ure earnest tone and clear reasoning of the well remembered February’ letter appear again In the message. It Is to the credit of the president that there Isuo wavering or flinching In his recommendation, and his utterances arc as bravely uncompromising as if he wen' not aware of the pronounced hostility of a large majority of his party in the house. The New York World (democrat ic) says; The message is a safe clear, conservative paper, and upon the whole It an able state document. The New York Times (indepen dent) says; The confidence of the country in President Cleveland's sound judgment, in his practical sense, and in his firm grasp of great public ques tions, will be confirmed and increased by bit first mes&agr to congress. It is so cethiug more and higher than a business message. * * To defend the national dignity and honor, to respect the laws himself, and insist that others rpa’i obey tin® to punish and prevent dishonest suits, to adTance'our vast material interests and maintain our national credit, and put wisdom above partisanship—these are the principles and purposes which guided the executive hand in preparing this review of the affairs of the nation. It U the complex sentiment of patriotism re duced to a practical expression and applied to the business of the state. The Louisville Courier (democrat ic ) says: The message of President Cleveland gives every assurance to the people that the govern ment Is in the hands of one careful, capable and patriotic. It shows that he has mastered the difficulties of the political situation, and that he will meet with sound judgment and courage immovable any emergency which may rise. lie speaks frankly, plainly, and forcibly on all the points affecting the welfare of the people, and those who heretofore have believed that he was an accident will be convinced that he is a man whose own force of character has marked out his destiny. The New York Evening Mail (re publican) says: The general underlying principles of the message are those of an honest and earnest democrat, whose convictions as to the limita lions of the sphere and functions of the federal government are very clear and strong In the application of these principles, and in the application of the seilled American princi ples as regards our foreign relations, Mr. Cleve land shows to good advantage. The Minneapolis Tribune ( repub lican ) speaks of the message as a dignified, studied effort: It does not heflgo, or apologize or cater to the silver party in a single expression; but it pro ceeds to demolish iheir position with a cumula tive use of facts and logic that is overwhelming. The St. Paul Pioneer Press (repub lican) says: Without a single exception, the views of the president on everyone of the multitude of sub jects which lie touches are wise and sound. The Buffalo Express (Republican) published at the President’s home, says: It cannot be said that Mr. Cleveland’s message lm verbose or diffuse. It is clearly all his own, and his stylo i.s always terse and compact. Many may disagree with the president’s opin ions, but in ..e, we think can fairly deny that they are presented in a candid, honorable and truthful way. It is a state paper of which no American will he ashamed and of w hich Uuflalo Americans have a right to he proud. Four years ago—or even a year ago—nobody would have chosen Mr. Cleveland us that citizen of buffalo best qualified to write a presidential message. Many would not now' choose him: Hut if we have many men here who can write as good a message, it is fair to conclude that this i* brainy kind of a tow n. County News.

Dr mares; were out driving, on Friday last they had occasion u> cross the railroad track near the depot, while ihe attemoon Ireight was switch ing. The locomotive was under a fair rate ef speed, going toward the crossing, upon which the horse of the reverend gentlemen had just stepped. The engine was reversed and brakes applied, and every effort made to stop, whi'e the spectators held their breath in the expectancy of seeing a frightful accident. But Ihe locomo tive passed jc- as the carriage left the crowdug, barely grazing the hind wheels. And the Darlington Journal of Wednesday. Dec, 9:fc, reports a somewhat similar escape, ns follows: Louis Gable of Seymour, had two close caisi for a trip to the other side of Jordan yesterday. He drove his team and sleigh load of lumber across the railroad track on Main Street just iu front of the south bound train iu the afternoon, and if he had been a quarter of a second later the locomotive would have knocked horses and deigh "galley west,"—wherever that is. In turn .ug the corner Irom Main to Louis Street, three minutes later, the lumber cramped the sleigh, throwing Mr. Gabel under the tanners; but his good luc-K preserved him a second and he eseped a second time without serious injury. He evi dently was not born to die by acccideut. A Singular Eica;‘. Matt Fisher, of the town of Ken dall, Lafayette county, was thresh ing his grain a short time ago, and had a team hauling the grain from the machine into his barn. When the wagon was partially loaded, Mr. Fisher, left his son, a lad of 12 years, sitting in the wagon holding the horses, when they started to run for the barn, and as one of their bridles came off the little fellow was unable to stop them; nor did they stop until they ran through the barn and out of the hack door, taking hoy, wagon, oats, a post and three boards of the barn with them. The door through which they made their exit was ten feet from the ground, but strange to say. nothing but the wagon was injured in the grand tumble. The hoy patiently kept his seat and came out without a scratch. The wagon tongue broke and prevented the wagon from fall ing upon the horses. The escape from serious injury to the boy and the horses was indeed a singular one. Kooks, Magazines, etc. Peck’s Sun of Dee. IJ, contained the following! notice of Strong’s History of the Territory o Wisconsin: The Sun office received, some lime ago, Moses M. .Strong’s History of the Territory of Wisconsin, from ISio to 18published by authority of the Male, and having somewhat the appearance of a Pub. Doc. it was not examined until this week, when we found it a very inter esting hook of over six hundred pages, and one that every Wisconsin citizen should read—the elder ones as a reminder of old Times, and the younger ones to learn something about the early history of the state they are now proud to call their own. Of course, much of it is statistical and dry, but their is enough history to make it very interesting, and it is exceptionally well compiled. A fine steel-plate engraving of the author appears in front, showing a typical American countenance, keen, kindly and in tellectual—that one of the pioneers who helped carve out a noble stale. It is made up mostly of con pilalions from various sources, and the author has aimed at accuracy rather than sensa tional description. It is a good book, and Mr. Strong’s time has been well employed. More reading than is given in fifteen books ' that sell for a dollar each, is given for one dollar for a year’s subscription* to the Chicago: Weekly Herald. Orders received at this office. The publishers of The Current announce that by a recent sale, this leading Western weekly be came the property of George W.

The two editors of The Current are men acquainted w ith Its history and needs. The recent article of the Journal Clerk of the National House of Repre sentatives, the present article of Judge Thoman uncivil service reform, and the prospectus of the Chistmas number, all show that we may ex pect still better things of The Current than it has yet accomplished. We learn that w ith the recent purchase the differences so long existing between The Current and the Western News Company come to an end which will be profit able for both parties.
