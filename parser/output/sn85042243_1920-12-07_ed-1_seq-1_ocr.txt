So large ,, "i" --7--------- PubllcltV had not been much pyblicity had been given to North Dakota conditions, he said. «,ven preliminary meeting of state bankers who have called to Bismarck by State Bank Examiner Lofthus to dis- the present situation. The keynote of the meetingjvas ed by Wesley McDowell, of Marion, who presided and urged the elevator at Grand Forks,-4nd the sale of $3,000,000 in real estate bonds to ease the credit situation that confronts the Bank of North Dakota. No Action Taken No formal action was taken. The meeting was merely a get together session and the bankers were u^ged to pack up private grievances, secrete all monkey wrenches and attend the session billed for late this afternoon in the chambers of the state senate. The announcement of Mr. McDowell to the bankers was made following a conference of the officers of the North Dakota State Bankers Association with Director Gjbneral Cathro of the Bank North Dakota, Governor Frazier and Attorney General-elect William Lemke. He declared that these gentlemen were willing to place all their cards on the table and meet the bankers in any I scheme to solve the various economic problems arising out of the present situation which confronts every state in the Union. Not Endorse Principle It was conceded by the bankers who addressed the conference that in any action to assist toward a harmonious settlement of dif­ ferences, the bankers did not endorse the principle of state-owned mills and elevators or the Bank of North Dakota, but were willing to give and take in the crisis and cooperate with the state adminis­ tration to carry to completion the mill and elevator under construc­ tion at Grand Forks and to get behind the Bank of North Dakota bonds to the extent of $3,000,000 so that public funds now tied up in North Dakota real estate mortgages could be released to do duty in the various localities where aid was most urgent. Spirit of Optimism There was a spirit of optimism, a seeming determination to lay aside all politcal consderations and idea of reprisals provided the representatives of the state administration would meet the bankers on a strictly business basis and with the sole idea of working out a plan that would place North Dakota where it be­ longed as Mr. McDowell termed it "high up on the roll of honor with integrity unimpaired." As the bankers left the hall to prepare for the afternoon meeting, Mr. McDowell admonished: No Monkey Wrenches "No monkey wrenches this afternoon genUemen." Judging from the applause which greeted Yesterday Coach Wolfe said he was ready to meet the school board more than half-,way in ad­ justing the difficulties, but it is doubtful if he will return here.

It is in that spirit that the backers will meet Governor Frazier, Mr.1 Cathro, Mr. Lofthus and Mr. Lemke this afternoon. It was pointed out, however, that the state has no plan worked out but is willing to accept any plan the bankers can propose which will com­ pose differences and solve existing principles.
