Completion of Bor mgs Under Hudson River—One oi Greatest of Engineer ing Feats After half a century of speculation on the practicability of tunneling the Hudson river from New Jersey to the island of Manhattan, it is now possi ble to walk dry-shod from Jersey to New York. The twin bores have been completed; that is, they have been cut through and cased in, though of course some finishing touches are yet to be put upon them. It was a few days ago that in the presence of the engi neers, the directors and a dozen re porters, W. G. Oakman, president of the Hudson Companies, split an old brick bulkhead with a hydraulic jack and completed the first Manhattan Jersey tunnel system. There was a six-inch gap in the wall. A gang of "ground hogs" rammed the breach a little wider, and the party crawled through into New York city. The old wall that was cut through was seven feet thick. It Is the relic of a former failure to tunnel the Hudson. Twenty-three years ago the engineers of the old Hudson Company, after cutting a considerable distance under the river, abandoned the enter prise and walled in the unfinished work with this brick bulkhead. Two tube-tunnels run parallel be neath the Hudson river, the work of boring them being done under direc tion of the New York and New Jer sey Railroad Company, but this com pany entrusted the actual performance of the work to the Hudson Companies. The present tube has been two years in the course of construction. The tubes will cost when completed about $13,000,000, and the entire work will cost about $30,000,000. Fifteen Feet in Diameter. T'ue tubes are 5,700 feet long, 15% feet in diameter and are intended for one track each, with a sidewalk for workmen. Two tubes have been start ed on the New Jersey shore, to run under the river to Cortlandt and Church streets. These tubes will be 16% feet in diameter. The tubes just completed will connect on the New Jersey shore with the Pennsylvania and the Lackawanna terminals. In Manhattan one branch will connect with the subway under Fourth ave nue at Astor Place. Another branch will run to Sixth avenue and Thirty third street. A trip through the entire length of the tunnel from the subway to Hoboken will cost only five cents. About six hundred men have been, em ployed in the tunnels. Cars will be running through these tube-tunnels in eighteen months. The safety of transportation in the tunnel needs no demonstration, for trains will run in a steel tube the strength of which to resist pressure has been care fully worked out. Being laid from fifteen to fifty feet below the river bed, it cannot be affected by the ac tion of tidewater. The tube is a steel lined hole in the earth, and except for "T 'P IIS 4 ;§gg zmm •. - ; *1 ■ /;•■ 1 ' * 3 r ■ , i 5 ' 1 v ' & m 91 i 1 ffi ! ■ r w THE 

UNCONVENTIONAL SARAH. It was Thomas Carlyle who said that all genius was akin to savagery. Sarah Bernhardt exemplifies this In the buodoir of her chateau in Paris. Mme, Bernhardt is a perfect barbarian in her defiance of all the convention schemes. Her alities regarding coin sleeping room is hung in royal purple decorated with peacock plumes.

It having been proved practicable to tunnel beneath the Hudson river, the Pennsylvania Railroad undertak ing will be pushed rapidly, and it may be expected that in course of time ev ery trunk line coming into Jersey City will have its own tunnel. The East river piercings do not present much of a problem. In less than five years trains ought to be running from Phil adelphia to Boston with no water to be crossed. It is believed that within ten years electric trains will make the trip from Philadelphia to New York in one hour. stuffing or take the turkey back. NO 

TURKEY STUFFING? Christmas Dinner Incomplete With out This 01 d-Fashioned Addition. The latest and most obnoxious crank in th gastronomic line is that deluded epicure who asserts that Christmas turkey must be served without "stuffing." He says it Is an anomaly, a thing without reason, an insult to the completeness of the bird, lie even declares that it de tracts from the sweet flavor and dell 1 cate aroma of the king of fowls. Thus he thrusts himself Into the pub arena, a mosl unwelcome ''butter in," striving to accomplish the down fall of an historic institution. He is not a true American. He has never tasted "stuffing as mother made it" —the real Simon-pure article, spooned out of The deep recesses of the royal bird In great crumbly masses that fill the room with rich aroma and the heart of man, woman and child with joy unconlined. It is the soul of the turkey, Is stuff ing. With the bird itself one is al ways bothered about what part he will have—whether white meat or dark; whether a wing, a thigh, or a drumstick; whether the wish-bone, the liver, or "the part that went over the fence last;" but for the stuffing, American sentiment Is universal. The only question Is: How much does one dare to eat? And then that en trancing, sage.v odor, from the. mys terious "yarlis" that enter into the mak ing—as sweet as the summer breezes over new mown hay—as delicate as the fragrance of orange blossoms on a wedding day. And perchance, in addition, we shall catch the sublime suggestion of an onion, wafted into our quivering nostrils, and recalling some dear departed maternal spirit who ministered to our boyish wants in days of yore. Turkey straight, without stuffing? Not while there is breath to sound a protest. It is the mission of civiliza tion to mix with naked nature the toothsome miscellany of tradition; to blend the work of nature and man; to sweeten with our best endeavor the plain blessings of an all-wise Providence. That's what gave us "stuffing;" and until the heart of man grows cold,—until the race loses its teeth aud lives on pills and tablets and predigested pap, its multitudes will insist on turkey as mother served it. Down with theories. Give us of the hangings are row after row of tiny monkey skulls, the eye sockets of which are illumined with electric lights. The "divine Sarah" has parted with her pet tiger, and now ha° for a com panion a large and ugly baboon, whose ears have been pierced so that tnov may carry huge rings of solid gold. Bernhardt is said to look as young as she did twenty years ago. Her face is without wrinkles, and her step Is a spry and her manner ns vivacio"s ^ when she first electrified her nat' city as an actress. A Washington gardener has origi nated what is believed by expert flor ists to be the finest rose ever grown— tuie Queen Beatrice. It is a tea of a peculiar shade of pink with a touch, in the bud. of light crimson. Its par ticular merit lies probably in the fact that none of the beauty of its coloring is destroyed either in natural or arti flcial light. Added to this it has a fragrance equal to, if not superior to that ot the American Beauty. The rose grows on straight and stur dy stems from two to three feet long; its parents are the two well-known va FORTUNE FOR A ROSE. A WONDERFUL NEW VARIETY WHICH BRINGS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

Kramer, of Washington, BIssett Is the head gardener of Mrs. Gardiner Hubbard, the widow of the late Gardiner Hublm-id, at one time president of the National Geographic Soei«"y. She is tlie mother-in-law of Alexander Graham Boll, the inventor of the telephone. The new rose w.is produced at her beautiful suburban residence, Twin Oaks, just outside of ^ at ' ona J capital. 1 he leading florists of the coun'rv have known of the existence of this rose for a year and have made various tempting offers for it. but it remaino i for I lorist Kramer to offer $30,0U0 and finally secure the beauty. Such a fabulous sum for a rose seems insignificant, however, when it Is remembered that hut a few .vers ago Thomas Lawson of "Frenzied Fi-; nance" fame paid $30,000 for a mere carnation, while the greater am unt of $125,000 was expended for the "Fi ancee" carnation. It is hinted that Mr. Lawson cleaned up over $100,000 out of the Lawson pink and the buy ers of the "Fiancee" carnation easily doubled the amount expended. And vet the "American Beautv" of whom every flower lover Is fond has a very, very sad history. A number of years ago a Washington gardener who made only a speeialtv of gar b-n roses, received from abroad a ship ment of plants, am^ng which was a "mongrel." ThH with oiU-of door cul-1 ture produced very large and fragran*, blooms. It attracted the attention .of Thomas Fields, a Wash'n 'ton flor ! st.

Fields experimented with tlie plant and found .that it exceeded even his fondest hopes. He named it thp "'m''-ioan Retiutv" and probably cleared $25,000 ■vWs one deal.

Among the popular garden roses which he produced are the "Climbing Meteor," a climbing varie ty with large red blooms; "Champion of the World," "Robert E. Lee," "F. H. Kramer," and many other _»orts which have been sold to catalogue houses and named by them, ile has just originated the "Climbing Ameri can Beauty" which will probably be listed by flower-sellers next spring.

The es tiinate is made that probably $150,000 or $200,000 will be made from this flower, Various artifices have been tried by c i ever hut unscrupulous people to ob tain sp ,. clmons of the "Queen Beat rice » * ose> nmny comlnK in to the Kramer establishment where a huge bouquet of the blooms was on exhibi tion, offering to purchase at large prices a single flower for a bouton niere.

PUBLIC LAND FRAUDS. PRESIDENTS PUBLIC LAND COMMISSION RECOM* MENDS RADICAL CHANCES IN LAWS. Richard Hamilton Byrd. Three men went out west to seek their fortunes. One located in the Middle West—not the Middle West, perhaps, as it is generally known, but the central section of the west ern half of the United States—In the desert country. lie started his suc cessful career by taking up a govern ment claim under tlie desert-land act. He was in the cattle country—the cow country—and he made his strike In cattle.' liis friend went further north; still In the desert area, close to the Cana dian line—In the sheep country. He took up a government homestead claim and commuted It. The third man went Into the far northwest—the Oregon country of Lewis and Clarke—and he took up a government timber t.nirn. He located in a land where lumbering was done. And those three men became great cattle and sheep and timber kings, and incidentally landlords; and their operations while widely different were singularly similar. They filed on their government claims and at the earliest possible moment euch man "proved up and sold out" for cash to larger land grabbers. And so they learned the mode and got their start toward land grabbing themselves. The desert eutrynmn was supposed under the law to live at least three years on his 320 acres and to expend during that period $960 In construct ing irrigation ditches and other im provements, and make it his home. Tliis was what was promised for the law when it was slipped through Congress. As a matter of fact, this mau spout a day with a team making a fake irrigation reservoir and then another day running a couple of fur rows around the laud, making oath that this constituted an Irrigation system for Its reclamation. Then within six months he "proved up," made tlie required payments to the government, aud secured a patent to his land. The homestead entryman,. who. un der the law. must reside continuously on his claim, erected a slab, one-room shanty, 10x12 feet ,and during a per iod of fourteen months slept in it Just five times. This was the extent of his home making. Then he, too, made oath of what lie had not done, offered the required payments to the govern ment and secured title to his land. The timber entryman went into the finest timber section of the United States—tlie dense forests of the far northwest—and under the timber and stone act, selected 160 acres of laud, the timlier standing upon which was worth $75 an acre, and swearing that he wanted it for his own personal use, purchased It from the government at. the fixed price of $2.50 on acre and immediately disposed of it. So that within fourteen months these three men had secured from Uncle Sam on aggregate of one square mile of gov ernment .land for their own benefit and use as homes, and sold it out to ,1V yy m
