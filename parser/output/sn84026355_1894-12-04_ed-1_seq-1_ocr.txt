IS IN FAVOR OP FREE COAL On the Subject of the Tariff the President i J'nvors Putting Iron and Coal on tho l'rec List Proposed Pluns for Na tional Bank Circulation. By the t'nlted Tress. Washington, Dec. 3. The presenta tion and reading of the President's an nua! message constituted . the chief point of Interest in today's session of the senate. There were seventy sena tors present on this, the first day. The reading of the message occupied two hours and five minutes. It attracted but little attention and was ordered to be printed and laid on the table the Usual course with such documents. The following Is a synopsis of Its contents: To the Congress of the United States: The assemblage within the nation's hulls of those charged with the duty of making lawa for the benefit of a generous mid free people Impressively suggests the exacting obligation and inexorable responsibility Involved In their task. At the threshold of such labor now to be undertaken by the congress of the t'nlted States and in the discharge of an executive duty enjoined by the constitution. 1 submit this coin munleatlon containing brief statements or the condition of national affairs and recommending such legislation as seems to me necessary and expedient. The his tory of our recent dealings with other na tions und our peaceful relations Willi them nt tills time additionally demonstrates the advantage of consistently adhering to a llrm but just foreign policy, free from en vious or ambitious national schemes, and characterized by entire honesty and sin cerilv. The terminal Ion of the civil war In Hrazil has been followed by the gener al prevalence of peace and order. It ap pearing at an early stage of the Insur rection that Its course would call for un usual watchfulness on the part of this gov ernment our naval force In the harbor of Hio Janeiro was strengthened. This pre caution 1 am satislled tended to restrict the issue to a simple trial of strength be tween the Xlrazlllan government and the insurgents and to avert complications which at times seemed Imminent. l)n the 17th of March last a new treaty with China, In further regulation of emi gration, wusslgned at Washington, and on Aug. 13, It received the sanction of the Senate. Katllication on the part of China and formal exchange are awaited to givo effect to this mutually benetlelal conven tion. A gratifying recognition of unlfoim Impartiality of this country towards all foreign stales was manifested by the co Incident request of the Chinese and Japa nese governments that the agents of the I'nited Stales should within proper limits afford protection to the subjec ts of the other during the suspension of diplomatic relations to a state of war. This deli cate ollice was accepted, and a misappre hension which gave rise to the belief that In affording this kindly unaffected protec tion our agents would exercise the? same authority which the withdrawn agents of the bellgerents had exercised was prompt ly corrected. Although the war between China anil Japan endangers no policy of the L niiefi states. It deserves our gravest consideration, by reason of Its disturbance of our glowing commercial Interests In the two countries and the increased dan gers which may result to our citizens I domiciled or sojourning In the Interior of . lima. jcioik uuoer a Kiipuutiion in nur V treaty with Korea, the lirst concluded with a western power, I felt constrained at the beginning of controversy to tender our good olllces to induce an amicable ar Vrangement of tho Initial difficulty growing out of the Japanese demands for an mill Is trntive lefonns In Korea, but the un happy precipitation of actual hostilities defeated kindly purpose. Deploring the destructive war between the two most powerful of the eastern nations and mix lous that our commercial Interests In those countries may be preserved and that the safety of our citizens there shall not be jeopardized I would not hesitate to heed any intimation that our friendly aid for the honorable termination of hostllp ties would be acceptable to both bellger ents. Regarding the Tcxns Fever. Acting upon the reported discovery of Texas fever In cargoes of Amerlenn cattle, the German prohibition against Impor tations or live stock anil rresh meats trom this country has been revived. It Is hoped that (iermany will soon become convinced that the Inhibition is as needless as it is harmful to mutual interests. The (ier inan government has protested against the provision of the customs tariff act which Imposes n decimating duty of one- Tenth or l cent a pounil on sugars com lug from countries paying an export bounty t hereon, claiming that the exae lion of such duty Is In contravention of articles live and nine 'of the trealy of IKSi with Prussia. In the Interests of the commerce of both countries and to avoid even the accusation of treaty violation. I recommend the repeal of so much of the statute as Imposes that duty, and I Invite attention to the accompanying report of the secretary or state containing a dis cussion of the questions raised by the German protests. Karly in the present year an agreement was reached with Great Hrltaln concern ing Instructions to be given to the naval commanders of the two governments in He hrlng sea, and the contiguous North Pacific ocean, for their guidance in the execution of the award of the Paris tribu nal of arbitration and the enforcement of tho regulations therein presented for the protection of seal life In tho waters men tioned. An understanding has also been reached for the payment by the I'nited States of $123,01)0 In full satisfaction of all claims which may be made by Great Hri tnln for damages growing out of contro versy as to fur seals In Hehring sea, and seizure of British vessels engaged In tak ing seals In those waters. 1 am convinced that a settlement upon the terms men tioned would be an equitable and advan tageous one, and I recommend that pro vision be made for the prompt payment of the stated sum. Thus far only France and Portugal have signified their willingness to adhere to the regulations established under the award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration. The boundary of British Guinea still remains In dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela. Be lieving that its early settlement on some Just basis nlike honorable to both parties, and In tho line of our established policy to remove from this hemisphere all causes of difference with powers beyond the Bea, I shull renew the efforts hereto fore made to bring about a restoration of diplomatic relations between the dis putants and to Induce a reference to arbi tration, a resort which Oi'eat Britain so conspicuously fnvorH In principal and re spects In practice and which Is earnestly Bought by her weaker adversary. Since communicating the volumin ous correspondence in regard to Ha waii and he action by the senate and house of representatives on certain questions submitted to the Judgment and wider discretion of con gress. The organization of a government in place of the provisional arrangement which followed the deposition of the queen has been announced with evidence of lis effective operation. The recogni tion usual In such cases has been accord ed the new government. Good will fostered by many Interests in common has marked our relations with our nearest southern neighbor. Peace be ing restored along her northern frontier, Mexico has asked the punishment of the late disturbers of her tranquility. There ought to be a new treaty of commerce and navigation with that country to take the pluco of the one which terminat ed thirteen yenrs ago. The problem of the storage and use of the waters of the o Grande for irrigation, should ho solved by appropriate concurrent action of the two Interested countries. The blue fields Situation. Prominent nmong the questions of tho year was the Bluelielils incident In what Is known as the Mosquito Indian strip "bor dering on tho Atlantic ocean and within tho jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By the treaty of IWiO between Great Britain and Nicaragua the former government ex pressly recognized the sovereignty of the latter over the strip and a limited form of self government was guaranteed to the Mosquito Indlnns to bo exerclHed accord ing to their customs for themselves and other dwellers within its limits, The so- called native government which grew to be largely made up or aliens ror many years disputed the sovereignty of Nica ragua over the strip and claimed the right to maintain therein a practically Independent municipal government. Karly In the past year eitoris oi Nicaragua 10 maintain, sovereignty over the Mosquito territory led to serious disturbances, cul minating n the suppression of the natrve government and the attempted substi tution or an lmpraciicaoie composite au mlnlstratlon 4n which Nicaragua and alien residents were to participate. Fail ure was followed by an Insurrection which for a time subverted Nicaragua rule, expelling her olllcers and restoring the old organization. This in turn gave place to existing local government es- tabiisneu ami upneni uy Nicaragua. Al though the alien interests arrayed against Nicaragua In these transactions .have been larirelv American and the commerce of that region for some time has been and still is chiefly controlled by our citi zens, we cannot for that reason challenge tho rightful sovereignty of Nicaragua over this important part of her domain. f or some months one, unci during pari or tho time two. of our naval ships have been stationed at Uluetlelds for the protection of all legitimate Interests of our citizens. in September last the government ai Nicaragua exnelled from Its territory twelve or more foreigners, including two Americans, for alleged participation in the seditious or revolutionary movement against the renublic at Uluetlelds al ready mentioned, but through tho earn est remonstrance of this government the two Americans have been permitted to return to the peaceful management of their business. Our naval commanders at the sceiio of these disturbances by their constant exhibition of firmness and good Judgment contributed largely to the prevent lou of more serious consequences and to the restoration of quiet and order. 1 regret that in the midst of these oc currences there happened a most grave and Irritating failure of Nlcaraguan Jus tice. An American citizen named Wil son, residing at Hamu, In tho Mosquito territory, was murdered by one Argueno, the acting governor of tho town. After some delay the murderer was arrested, but so confined or guarded that he es caped and notwithstanding our repeated demands it Is claimed that his recapture has been Impossible by reason or nis flight bevond Nlcaraguan Jurisdiction. The Nlcuragiinn authorities having given notice of forfeiture of their concession to the canal ooinpany, on grounds purely technical and not embraced in the con tract have receded from that position. The sealing Interests of Russia in Ber ing sea are second only to our own. A modus Vivendi has therefore been con cluded with the imperial government restrictive of poaching on the Hussian rookeries and of sealing In waters which were comprehended In the protected area defined In the Paris award. I'nreasonable and unjust tines Imposed by Spain on the vessels and commerce of the rnlted States have demanded from time to time during the last twenty years earnest remonstrance on the part of our government. This conduct is in strange contrast with the considerate and lib eral treatment extended to Spanish ves sel and cargoes in our ports in like cases. No satisfactory settlement of these vex atious questions have yet been reached. in my last annual message 1 adverted to the claim on the part of Turkey of the right to expel as persons undesirable and dangerous Armenians naturalized in the United States, and returning to Turkish Jurisdiction. Numerous questions In this relation have arisen. While this govern ment acquiesces in the asserted right of expulsion It will not consent that Armen ians may be imprisoned or otherwise pun ished for no other reason than having ac quired without Imperial consent Ameri can citizenship. The present government of Samoa has utterly failed to correct, If Indeed it has not aggravated, the very evils it was in tended to prevent. It has not stimulated our commerce with the islands. Our par ticipation in its establishment against the wishes of natives was In plain de fiance of the conservative teachings and warnings of the wise and palmitic men who laid the foundations of our free In stitutions and I invite an expression of the Judgment of congress on the propriety of steps being tnken by this government looking to the withdrawal from its en gagements with other powers on some reasonable terms not prejudicial to any ol our existing rignts. On the Treasury Ilcports. The secretury of the treasury reports that the receipts of tho government from nil sources of revenue during the fiscal year ended Juno 3U, 1KW, amounted to $372, Hi'.m.W, and Its expenditures to SUI3,n."i.- 7'iS.lfl, leaving a deficit of $tfi,Mn,:i;u..,S.

Although this Is appar ently very slight decrease compared with tho previous year, he actual effective force has heen Increased to the equivalent of nearly two regiments through the re organization of the system of recruiting and the consequent releaso to regimental duty of tho large number of men hitherto serving at the recruiting depots. Tim nbolltlun of these depots, it Is predicted, will furthermore eftoct an annual reduc tion approximating $250,000 in the direct expenditures oesuies promoting gene ling generally e 7,' ' Contlroad. oak Pag 

MUSI SHELL OUT THE YEN Japan Will Not Make Peace With an Empty 1'ockctbook. WILL ACCEPT AX IDEMXITY But China's Peace Offering Will Havo to Ho of a Princely Character Prepara tions for the Winter Campaign, Good Paper Will lie Accepted. By the United Press. Yokohama, Doc. 3. According to the Beml-ofliclal press, Japan hus decided to insist upon dieavy conditions of peace, which will be increased as the war is prolonged. If the war was don eluded at the present time, Japan would accept an indemnity of 400,000,000 yen (a gold yen la valued at 99.7 cents, silver 74.5) and the cession of the terri tory now occupied by her forces. Too much weight should not be attached to the Chinese overtures for peace, for it la believed that Japan will be required to give her enemy further proof of her power In order that the Chinese people may learn that their government sued for peace. If Taku and Shan-Hal-Kwan cannot be attacked this winter, owliig to the severity of the climate, the war will be carried on in other populous parts of China. No armistice will be granted unless China formally sues for peace and surrenders Pekln to 'the Japanese, or gives other pledges In proportion to the demands of Japan. If China Is un able to pay the war Indemnity Immedi ately, a part of the sum decided upon paid down will be accepted and the re mainder may be paid In Instalments with Interest. It must, ihowever, be stipulated that the power of Japan is regarded as absolute, and then there will bo no further opposition to the con clusion of peace. Ixelinnge of Cruelties. London, Dec. 3. The correspondent of the Times telegraphs as follows from Hiroshima, Japan: "I have Just re turned from the seat of war, nnd had a conversation with Viscount Mutsu Munemltzu, the foreign minister, in re gard to the misconduct of the Japa nese at Port Arthur. I Informed him that'l had watched tho Japanese army enter tho town. The Chinese resisted to the last. I saw Chinese in plnin clothes with firearms concealed on their persons. I also found explosive bullets. The Japanese reported that civilians fired upon them from the houses, and they therefore deemed It necessary to exterminate them. Tho Japanese were further excited by finding the mutilated bodies of Japanese prisoners. Some of these prisoners had been burned alive. I saw no resistance In the town. Dur ing the next four dnys the Japanese pillaged the whole town, and killed al most every man. Very few women or children were killed. Those who were killed were probably killed unintention ally. I saw scores of Chinese prisoners pinioned, stripped and shot, hacked with knives, ripped open, disem bowelled nnd dismembered. Many bodies were partly burned. "The foreign minister expressed him self as Intensely surprised and grieved. Hitherto, he said, the Japanese army had been admired for Its humanity and discipline. He was unwilling to be lieve It possible that they had acted as reported, or to express an opinion on the subject until a detailed official re port arrived. Meanwhile he authorized me to say that he was certain the gov ernment was sincerely determined to net on principles of humanity and civil ization, and was firmly resolved to maintain the honor of Japan, and- re fute Chinese slanders. I nm satislled that the government desires neither to conceal the truth not to permit cruel ties.'" MAX

SYRIAN SMIMLEBS. Detroit Officers Nun Down a (lung of Free Traders loaded with Turkish Embroid eries und l'uncy Goods. By the United Press. Detroit, Dec. 3. Tho police and cus toms officers have just run down a gang of smugglers who have for over a year past been smuggling thousands of dol lars worth of Turkish embroideries and fancy goods from Windsor to Detroit. Four members of the gang have been arrested, two of whom are women. Most of the goods were shipped to New York. Certain Armenian and Syrian merchants In New York have been sell ing these goods at loss than their cost to importers, but although they were closely watched, the discovery of the smugglers was brought about by the Detroit police. The latter recently no ticed that empty trunks were being carried into a room nt No". 270 Jefferson avenue and taken out again filled nnd shipped to New York. The police detectives shadowed this operation Saturday, and then entered the room and captured Asaph Oobreen and Mrs. Selma Oobreen, Syrians; Mrs. Kate Moore, of Windsor, and a young Italian from New York named George Mlcalanl. A trunk which hnd just been Hiked for shipment contained quantities of costly embroideries and Turkish fancy goods valued at $1,300. Around the bodies of the women were found $500 worth of the same kind of goods which had just been brought across the river. The duties on the ar ticles would amount to about 60 per cent.

Officials of the stale department who at first placed no reliance whatever In the reports of massacred Armenians In Asiatic Turkey are now disposed to attach some significance to the lack of In formation obtainable by Ameiicun di plomatic and consular agents In Turkey who have had orders for over ten days to investigate and report upon the matter, and whoso dispatches indi cate that obstacles arc being placed In their way by the Turkish authorities. It Is claimed at the Btate department that the American legation nt Constan tinople has sent no Information regard ing the- alleged outrages, although suf ficient time has elapsed under ordinary circumstances for Minister Terrell to be presented with proof that the uffalr bus been exaggerated. It Is understood that cabled dis patches have also been received from our consul at Slvas, who is our neare.U representative to the scene of the af fair, and so fur he has been unable to transmit more than a statement of the rumors that reached him.
