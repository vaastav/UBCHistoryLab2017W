In fact, the chief Interest in the document den tors in the president's views on public qtl"t tions as contained in his recommendations. So prosperous nro the United Stnles at present that the president, In tho nicssape Bent in yesterday, congratulates the peo ple warmly upon the fact. He then dwells upon our relations to other nations. Wo are at peace with every peoplo and sustain with them the most cordial re lations. In our dealings with Great llritain, France, Germany, Russia, Stilly, and in fact all the countries, hut Spain, and possibly Turkey, ' any requests made by us lately have been at once complied with, and courtesies have been cheerfully and mutually extended. With reference to Spain the president com plains that our demands upon her In most instances have not been met with a disposi tion to accede as promptly and cheerfully thereto as ought to have been, and speaks of the heavy fines imposed in Spanish ports upon American vessels and the excessive tees charged upon American importations. He details the fact that Germany has invited us to one or her exhibitions in '83 and asks that provision be made to comply with tho request; that Italy has been very profuse in its expres sions of regret over the death of Minister Marsh; that the scope of the extradition treaty with Belgium has been enlarged; that tha Swiss government lias ceaseu to cive countenance to tho ship ment .of its paupers and criminals to America; recommends' the continu ance with modifications of the reciprocity treat v with the 8ndwich Islands, and dwells upon the part played by our state department with reference to tho Llnli Teruvian troubles. In commenting on foreign affairs, the president shows th.it he baa the correct American idea of letting other people's business alone, and is very moderate. In view of the growing disposi tion among the nations to settlo important questions by conference and arbi tration, he very sensibly sug gests that greater powers should be conferred upon the president with refer - enca to the appointment of delegates to those international conventions. There is no special foreign policy indicated by Mn. Aetudb's remarks on our foreign relations, nor nothing new or startling to tell. As to home affairs, be dwells at length and sta tistically upon the financial and industrial condition of the Union. The show ing throughout is an admirable one, and denotes that within, our affairs - are as prosperous and as satisfactory as aro our relations with the outside world. Upon the great subject of interest now in America, the revision or abolition of the tarifr, the president is just where his party stands, lie wants the in ternal revenue taxes reduced, but by the obolitionof the tax on articles other than whisky and tobacco. In this respect ho and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue stand upon the same platfoam. Tho president unfortunitcly oilers tho coun try no new views, no startling sug gestions, no broad and progressive statesmanship in his treatment of the tariff or financial problems of the government. He thir.ks with his party that there should be protection, but that our present system needs corrections to the extent of equaliz iag duties and taxation. With reference to tlm war and navy departments he is in accord with the secretaries of those arms, and approves of the recommenda tions made bv tbem in their reports. He thinks, of course, that the bill passed throngh the influence of Jlongeow Bnd K ei rim, by t.ie last session of congress, for the Improvement of old and construction ol Dew vessels is calculated to put that arm of defence on a substantial footing, and proceeds to moxe suggestions as to tne merchant marine, whose decadence he laments. He very rightly and sensibly ap proves of a more thorough system ot coast' defences. In his remarks about the post-office department the president tpVes itmns and nnder Hie latest, develop, merit's, 'T sensible and proper grounds for the reduction of postage. We have cer tainly reached that point where this depart ment can be run more economically and with less cost to the people. rswiPtxT Akthcs walks on eggs though the depart ment of Initio, and indulges in merely a detail of the transactions there within the last few months, tho facts being familiar to the reading pub lic In ' the interior department he takes a rational view of matters and ad vocates the allotment of lands to the In dians Individually and the fullest and best education of their youth. He also has something to say of the railroads and Inter state commerce Coming in as the mes sift did, in broken parcels from the wilts, it is, of course, impossi ble to give thorough or exhsus tire epi'ome thereof at this time bat the main feature bare been touched on.

TOSTAL DEPARTMENT, The report of the postmastor-general gives evidence of the satiafaciory condition of that department and contains many val uable dita and accompanying suggestions which cannot fail to be of interest, the in formation that it affords, that tho receipts fur the liscal year have ex pu.fli.H iho exnenditures, must be ln Ilia nlitturVitt llin nbilit-vof changing the present basis for fixing salaries mid ullowauces, of extending the monev-order system, of enlarging the lunctions'of tlie postal establishnieiils, to place under its control the telegraph sys tem of tho country, though from this last and most important recommeudution I must withhold my concurrence. At the last session of congress several bills were introduced into the house of rep resentatives fur t he reduction of letter post ace to the rate of two cents per half-ounce. I have given much study and reflection to this, and am thoroughly convinced that such action would be ior the beat interests of the public. It has been the policy ot the government from its foundation to defray as far as possible the expense of carrying the mails by a direct tax iu tho form of a postage. It has never been claimed, however, that this soryico ought to bo productive of the requisite amount of revenue.. As has been stated alre-uiv, thereport of tho postmaster-general shows that there is now a very consid erable surplus in his department, aud that henceforth the receipts are likejy to increase at a much greater ratio than the expenditure. Unless some change is made in the existing laws the prollts ol the po-tal service will in a very lew years swell tho revenues of the Kcvernnieut manv millions ot dollars. The time seems ou.ioitis for some reduction in the rates of pos'. -e. In what shall that reduct ion consist? a review of the legislation which has been bad upon t'uij subject dur in : the last thirty years discl es that do mestic letters constitute the only class of mail matters which has never been invored by a substantial reduction of rates. I am convinced that the burden of maintaining the service falls most unequally upon that class, and that more than ay other it is entitled to present, rcliel; that such relief may bo extended without doubt to other public interests, will be discovered upon reviewing the re. Hilts of former deductions. Immediately prior to tho act of 1H15 the postage upon a letter composed of a single sheet was as 10 milts or less, li cents; between SO and 80 miles, 10 cents; between 80 and 150 miles, 12J cents; be tween l.W and 400 miles. i(; over vm niueii, , '-j ant of 1815 the postage upon a single letter cimveved for any distance under M0 miles V.i ,t R pints, mill for any creator dis tance at. 10 cents, lly the act of 1851 it was .,,,, i ,! i.ht a tingle letter, if prepaid, ii i.i .o xnrridit any distance not to ex ceed 3,000 miles for 3 cents, anil any greater distance for u cents, ll win "o uuuiw .....i. .,r h.ou iwrinetloni were of a radical character and relatively quite as important as that which is now proposed. J n each case there ensued a temporary loss of rev enue, but there was a sudden and large influx of business, which substantially recovered that loss within three years. Unless the experi ence of past legislation In this country and elsewhere eocs for naught, it may be safely predicted that the stimulus of jo pel tcuUm reduction in tax for carriage would at once Incrcuse t he number of letters consigned to tbe msils. Tho advantages of secrecy would lesd to a very general substitution of sealed packets for postal cards and open, irregular and divers other wav and the volume of li rat class matter would be enormous y auirment'd. finch Increase amounted in Knifland in the first year or the adoption of penny postage to more than lia per cent. As a result of carelul estimates, the dei n. of which cannot be submitted. I iu con vinced that the deficiency for the flnt year, her the proposed reduction, would not ex- .i i - .,1 r thu exnenditures. or ).- UW.ttO, w hile the deliciency after the reduc tion of IMS was more uiau i i.i after that of 1KU, was 27 per cent. Another interesting comnanson is af forded by statiMics furnished me by the post office department. The act of 113 was pa---d in the face of the Uct that thrre existed a deficiency of more than i.lof. that of 1KM was encouraged by the Iiight surplus of 132.M). It congress should approve theee mirgcstions it may be deemed d-irai le to supply to some ex tent the deliciency which must for a lime result by i-creaii.g Uie charge for raiTTing merchandise, which in now only 16 oenu pr pound, but even wi hoot such an io- rrei,- I am ccmiHieiinriai m7"i ,--dertbe diminished TI M would equal the expenditures after the lapse of three or four rears. tiErTwtT or jrincE.

Aiming oilier important subjects which are included within the secretary's report and which will doubtless furnish occasion for congressional attention, may bo men tioned tlie neglect of the railroad compan ies to which la'ge grants nf land wero uiailo by tho ucts of 1NI2 and lit, to take title thereto, and their consequent exemption from local taxation. No survey of our material condition can fail to suggest inquiries as to the moral and intellectual progress of the people. The ccnsiiB returns disclose an alariningstate ol illiteracy in certain portions of the country where the provision for schools Is grossly inadequate. It is a momentous question for the decision of congress wheth er immediate, substantial aid should be ex tended by the general government for sup plimenting the efforts of private bene ficence, and of state and territorial legisla tion, in behalf of cducubion. The regulation of inter-state com'" " has already been the subj'eatof you : ' ..u or.itinnu. One of the incnk-:,!'iui the mar velous extension ol the railway system of the country lias been the adop tion of such measures - by tbe corporation which own or control the roads as has tendered to impair the advantages of healthful competition, nnd make hurtful discriminations in the advancement of freights. These incqiiali. ties have been corrected in several ot the states by appropriate legislation, the effect of which is necessarily restricted to the limits of tlieir own territory. So far as such mischiefs affect commerce between il-n diniPK nr between anvone of the states nnd a foreign country they aro subjects of concern, and congress aioue cau aiioru relief. rOLYGAMY. The results which have thus far attended tho enforcement of the recent statute fur the suppression oi polygamy :n uie lernio ries uro reported by the secretary of the in terior. It is not probable that any addi tional lenislation in this regard will be deemed desirable until the effect of existing laws shall be more clearly observed and studied. I congratulate you that the com missioners . under whose supervision theso laws have been put in operation ffre encouraged to be that the evil at which they are aiming may be suppressed with out resort to sucn rauicai measures as in some quarters have been thought indispen sable for success. The close relation of the general govern ment to the territories preparing to be great states may well engage your special atten tion. It is there that the Indian disturb ances mainly occur and that polygamy has found room for its growth. I cannot doubt that a carelul ourvey of territorial legisla tion would be of the highest utility, and property would become more secure, the liability of outbreaks between Indians and uriiitP9 nrniilil hn lessened, the nublicdomaiu would be more securely guarded, and better progress be made in tne instruction oi ine young. 

ALASKA is still without any form of civil govern ment. If means were provided for the ed ucation of its people and for tho proteclion of their lives and property, the immense resources of the region would make per manent Beuiemem. aim new neius ior in dustry and enterprise. TIIK REPORT Or THE COMMISSIONER OF AOlil- CPLTURE presents a:i account of the labor of that de partment during the past year, and in cludes information of much interest to tho general public. The condition of the forests of tho coun try and the destruction that is taking pl-ice gives cause fbrserious apprehension. Their action in protecting the earth's surface, iu modifying the extremes of climate and rcg ulatinc and sustaining the flow of springs and streams is not well understood, and their importance in relation to the growdi and prosperity of tbe country cannot be safely disregarded. They are fust disap pearing tefore destructive rires, and the le gitimate requirement of our increasing population, und their total extinction can not be lonu dolayed unless bet ter methods than now prevail shall be adopted for their nrntertinn and cultivation. The attention of congress is invited to the necessity ol ad ditional legislation to secure the preserva tion oi the valuable forests still remaining on the public domain, especially in tne ex treme western states and territories, where the necessity fir their preservation is great er than iu lets moontainous regions and where the prevailing dryness of the climate renders their restoration, if they are once destroyed, well nigh impossible. CIVIL 8EKVICK. The communication which I made to con gress at its first session in December last contained a somewhat full statement of my sentiments in relation to the principles and rules which ought to govern appoint ments to public service. Referring to the various plans which had therefore been the subject of discussion in the national legislature, plana which in the main were modeled upon me nysuiiu ahiuh-uoiaiub iu Great llritain, but which lacked certain of the promineut features whereby that sys tem isdistinguishrd.I felt bound to intimate my tbouKhts, whether they or any ol them would afford an adequato remedy for the evils which they aimed to correct. I de clared, nevertheless, th-t if the pro)osed measures should prove acceptable to con gress, they would receive the unhesitating support of the executive. Since tbe sug geuior.s were submitted for vourconsidera t inn ihnr hat Wn no lcii.-latinn udoii the subject to which they relate, but there has, meantime, b;en an increase in tbe pub ic Interest on that subject, and the people of tlie country, apparently with out distinction of party, have it. various ways, and upon frequent occasions given expression to their esrnest wish for prompt and definite action. In my judgment such action elided no longer be postponed. I may add that my own sense of its pressing importance bas been c,uickened byobserva tion in tbe practical phases of the service, to which attention has more than once been called by predecessor. The civil list now comprises about loO .000 persona, the large part of whom, musl, under the terms of the constitution, be selected by the president, either directly or tbrongh bis own appo. riled apenta. in the early years of the administration ol the roremmeiit tbe pronal directioa of appointments to tbe civil service msy not bare been an irksome task f -r the execu tive, but now that Hit boiden bas increaMd fully a boidred-li'd.;ii has become greater than be ongl.t to b- ar, and it necessarily detracts his time and attention from the proper dieebarire of other dalles, no b-ss delicate and responsible, and which in tbe very nature ot tb'ng cannot be delegated to other bands, la tbe judgment ot not a lew who hare riven study aud reflection to this mattrr, tbe nation bas outgrown tbe provisions which the conMitntion bss established fft rilling tbe minor orlices in the public servic. but whatever may be thoncht of tbe wisdom or expediency of changing tbe fundamental law in this re rani, it is certain much relief msy be af forded not only to president and to the bead of tne departments, but to senators end representatives in congress by discreet Irri'lat'on. Ibev would be protected in a r?fl measure by the bid now pending be fore the senate, or by any otaer which tb out a embody its important feat ure trma Uie preure of persooal troportonity and from the labor or exam iot mof.icurir claims and pretentions of candidate. 1 tn befire the cloe ot tbe (,iterit season some dertwre action may be taken for the corrertifm ot the enis wbiek ar ia the pfwtit methods of ap pointment, and I awure row of my bewrty rr-operauoa ia any roeajree which are likeiy toeondire to that end.

It has been repeat edly alleged that he has in this particular signally departed from the course which had been pursued under recent administra tions of tho government. The facts nro as follows: Tho whole number of executive anno intnients during the four years Inline diatelv nrjeeding Mr. (larlicld's accession to thn nresidencv was 2 (Ml : of this number 211. or U per cout., involved the removal of previous incumbents. Tbe rates of ronewtls to tho number ot appointments, wis mucu the same during each of those four years. In the first year, with 790 appointments, there were 71 removals, or u if-io per cent in the second, with 017 appointments, there were 80 removals, or 8 510 percent.; in the third, with 480 appointments, there were 48 removals, or 10 per cent.; in the fourth, with 42!) appointments, there were .ovals, or 8 6 10 per cent. In the four .ntlis oi President (iarfield's administra tion there were 390 appointments and 80 re movals, or 22 7-10 per cent. Precisely the same number ot removal Ml, nave taken place in the fourteen months which linve since elapsed but they constitute only j pur cent of the whole number of appointments; li within that period aud less than 2-t of the entire list of officials, 3,4o0, exclusive ot the army and navy, which are tilled by presidential appointment. I desire to exoress my approval of such leoislation as may be found necessary for supplementing' the existing provisions of law in relation io political assessments. xn July last I authorized a public announce ment that their action in that regard would in no manner affect their official status. In this announcement I acted upon the view which I had always maintained and still maintain, thut a public oflicer should be absolutely free as any other citizen to give or withhold a contribution for the aid of the political party of his choice. It bos, however, been urged, and doubtless not without foundation in tact, that, Dy sonci iminn nf snneriors and by other methods, such contributions have at tunes bean ob- tained from persons whose only motive for giving nas neen tear oi wuab 111101 befall them it they refused to give it. without saying that such contributions are not voluntary, and in my udgment their collection snotiia oe pro lihlled hv law. A hill which wili effectu ally suppress them will receive my cordial approval. DllSTniCT OP
