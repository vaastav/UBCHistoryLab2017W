Scraps and Jacts. ? Five uew members of congress were sworn in yesterday. They were elected to fill vacancies caused by deaths and resignations. As the result of these elections the Republicans lose and the Democrats gain oue member of the house. E. H. Driggs, Democrat, has been elected to succeed F. H. Wilson, Republican, who resigned to become postmaster of Brooklyn. The other changes on the house roll are as follows : Francis L. Griffith, of Greeusburg, Ind., Democrat, succeeds Judge Holman, Democrat, who died ; Henry G. Boutelle, Republican, succeeds the late Representative Cook, Republican, from Chicago; the late Ashley B. Wright, of the First Massachusetts district, is succeeded by Geo. P. Lawrence, also a Republican ; Representative McLaurin has been elected to the senate, ana ne mis uwu succeeded in the house by James Nortou. ? "Practically all the cash wheat in the United States will soon have passed into the hands of parties who want the actual wheat, and who are willing to pay the contract price for it," says a St. Louis dispatch of the 1st instant. "This is the outcome of the tremendous deal set on foot in mid-summer by certain cliques in every large maiket in America. Today there were in the neighborhood of 1.250,000 bushels delivered to the same parties in this city, and by the end of December the amount may be increased to close ou to 2,000,000 bushels, the largest game the bulls and bears all over the United States have ever played. Fortuues are involved?not only here, but in all of the great markets. It will lake something over $1,000,000 to pay for the wheat that will be delivered to what is known as the Hartisk-Speucer crowd in this city today." ? John Morgan, a condemned murderer, made a clear escape from the Ripley, West Virginia, jail one day last week. He was to have beeu hanged on December 15. Not loug ago he sold a full confession of his crime to a newspaper for $25. With a part of the mouey he bought a new suit of clothes which, he announced, it was his iuteution to wear ou the gallows. He was kept at night in a steel cage. Friday night he made a dummy of his old clothes, covered it up with bis blanket, and then climbed up ou top of the cage. The jailer came aloug, and without making any special examination, was deceived by the dummy. He locked the door aud went on about his business. Outside of the cage, it was uot a difficult matter ior luorgau iu get uut ui mo jail, and next morning be was gone. A reward of $500 has been offered for his reeapture. ? Iu bis annual report to the secretary of the treasury, Mr. Forman, commissioner of internal revenue, estimates the receipts from all sources for the curreut hscal year will aggregate at least $155,000,000, an increase over 1897 of about $8,300,000. A comparative statement of the receipts during the last fiscal year is giveu in pari as follows : Spirits, $82,008,542 ; increase over 1896, $1,338,472. Tobacco, $30,710,297 ; decrease, $1,231. Fermented liquors, $32,472,162; decrease, $1,312,072. The cost of the collection of the revenues during the last fiscal year was $3,848,469. During the year 2,241 illicit stills were destroyed and 32 were removed ; 829 persons were arrested, 1 killed and 3 wounded. Of the stills seized and destroyed 228 were located in Alabama, 841 in Georgia, 463 in North Carolina, 190 in South Carolina, aud 245 iu the 6lh Virginia district. During the last ten years ten officers were killed and 16 were wounded by moonshiners. ? The questiou is, how much longer can Spaiu afford to hold on to Cuba. General Blanco's re report to the home government shows that of 192,000 soldiers of the regular army sent to General Weyler, only 89,000 now remain tit for duty. In the hospitals are to be found 40,090, thus leaving 63,000 who have perished of wounds or disease. "When we remember," says the New York Eveuing Post, "that this appalling loss of life has beeu suffered by an army which has never fought a pitched battle worthy of the name, in a struggle with an enemy who probably never mustered more than 20,000 rifles in any one place, we get an idea of the stupendous task which confronts Spain in the suppression of the Cuban rebellion." It is marvelous that Spain has hung on so long, aud that she has not found out, as Great Britian did, that it is cheaper to let the rebellious colony go. ? The postoffice department is taking a firm stand against the so-called "missing letter" and "missing word" contests which are being conducted by a number of publishers to increase the subscriptions of their papers. The lottery law directs that the postmaster general upon evidence satisfactory to himself that a person is operating through the mails a lottery, or scheme offering dependent upon lottery or -1 i.;u:. nr alt UUUUUC, JJIVIUUll; llic VIUKVIJ VI nil mail matter to it. All newspapers and periodicals coutaiuing advertisements of this character are forbidden transmission in the mails. This law, it is now announced, will be applied to all schemes which are violations, if they are coutinued in operation, .or advertisements of them are published. Missing letter contests are held to be violations because many correct answers can be given ; but only one list is determined "the correct list," by the promoter of the scheme. The chance consists of guessing what words compose the so-called "correct list." Such schemes are held to be especially obnoxious, owing to the skillful wording of the advertisements which make the chauce for obtaining a prize more remote than in the defunct Louisiana lottery. ? Philadelphia Ledger : That a concerted effort will be made at the approaching session of congress to aunex Hawaii to the United States is plainly evident, and it is to be regretted that President McKinley is likely to favor the proposition, if not to recommend it. The movement had its origin first with the speculators in sugar, and next with the handful of Americans resident in the Sandwich islands, who are bent upon ousting the natives from their heritage. The de facto government in Hawaii is not representative of the people, and would not eudure one week but for the pop ular impression that it has the moral support of the United States. The contention of the advocates of annexation is that possession of the islands is necessary for this country because of their strategic importance in the Pacific, and that Japan, or some other nation, will aunex them if we do not. Hawaii is nearly as far away from our shores as Europe, and is comparatively valueless to us. At present we have close treaty relations with the islands, and, with the possible exception of Japau, every natiou recognizes ??..!? Waivaii nnmoci within the SDherC of American influence. Without expense we are now enjoying all of the benefits which would result from a more intimate connection, and we are free from the entanglements and annoying problems which would face us in the event of annexation.

YORKVILLE, S. C.: WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8,1897. ? Mr. E. D. Thompson ought to goto Clemson, or some of Clemson's professors ought to go to see Mr. E. D. Thompson. Which ? ? If he who makes two blades of grass grow where only one grew before is a benefactor, what about him who gathers four bales of cotton from a plot oflf which very few other people have ever succeeded in gathering three? ? The Columbia Register, which not otig ago spoke rather slightingly of the Roddey plan, has evidently been giving 'L- - " nomfiil ahi(tr Tt. now IUC limi 31 a UIVIO VUlViUt ? thinks ibut, perhaps, after all, there might be something in it. ? William J. Bryan expressed himself briefly, on Monday, in regard to the president's message as follows: "The message indicates an intention upon the part of v.he president to aid in turning the issue of paper money over to the national banks, and, in the meantime, a purpose to give gold a further superiority over silver as money." ? The Baptist State convention, in session in Rock Hill last week, expressed itself on the liquor question in a resolution ottered by Rev. J. E. Covington, as follows: "Resolved, That it is the sense of this convention that the making, sale and use of intoxicating liquors as a beverage is against the moral welfare of our people, and we hope the day is not far distant when they shall be liberated from this evil by the combined influence of pure religion, righteous public sentiment and wise legal enactment." ? The recent municipal election in Augusta was confessedly a most disgraceful affair. Votes were bought and sold openly and aboveboard, at from ?5 each, up-1 ward. The Walsh element engaged in the traftic as tlagrantly as did the alleged ringsters. In 1'aet, that they spent even more money for votes is quite probable. But, while admitting their guilt, they seek to justify themselves. The ring had long since established the practice, and there was no other possible means of success. After all, the success of the Reformers is of doubtful credit, and unless Mr. Walsh can manage to stamp out the disgraceful practice in the future, the city will profit little by his election. ? Postmaster Rapier, of Mobile, Ala., is making it interesting for P. D. Barker, his Republican successor. Rapier was appointed by Cleveland and his commission does not expire until December, 189S. The statute relating to postmasters provides that they may be appointed or removed by the president by and with the consent of the senate. Barker was appointed by McKinley in October last, the appointment to take effect at once; but Rapier insists that there can be no change until the senate not only confirms the removal, but the new appointment, and refuses to turn over the oflice. Heretofore incumbents have been in the habit of getting out immediately upon being shown the commission of the new appointee, and that is what makes the case so interesting. ? One of the greatest achievements of modern civilization is in the security, comfort and convenience of travel. The New York newspapers relate that, on Friday last, five children, all girls, in three separate groups, arrived in that city unattended from Europe. One of them, Ilko Sebil, a little blue-eyed, five-yearold, came from her home in Central Russia, with the directions of her route on a tag pinned to her bib. Gentle railroad and steamship employees took her from conveyance to conveyance until she reached her father in New York. Two other children, 7 and 5 years old, traveled from Russia to New York, with no attendance, in the same ship. Two more girls, from 7 to 10, came in another ship from Austria. Their parents were waiting for them on their arrival. ? The indications arc that the next big war will be between Russia and Japan. Corea is the bone of contention. Sometime back it was agreed that both countries would keep out of this kingdom. Not long ago Japan became aware that the Corean army was being drilled by Russian oflicers and made complaint. Russia represented that the officers were in Corea as private individuals, and that she was not responsible. Japan, though not satisfied, of course, had to accept the | situation. Lately, tlio Russian papers have been printing stories to the effect that Japan is arranging, by the purchase of lands, to establish military posts in C'orea, and the situation generally is such as to lead close observers to believe that war will be on within the next few months. ? Reports from the cotton growing states indicate that the convention to be held in Atlanta on December 14 will be a large and representative one, and there seems to be good reason to hope that, as the result of that convention, the cotton growers will be ablo to organize an association which will confer practical benefits. All that is necessary is to get the cotton growers to minxing one way?that is in the direction of improving their condition?one time, and the thing is done. However fond some among us may be of referring to the farmer as a downtrodden class of citizens in danger of serfdom, all the same, it is a fact that the cotton growers of the south constitute the most intelligent agricultural class that the world ever saw, and if thoroughly aroused on the line they are now moving, it will be well for opposition to stand from under. ? Mr. E. D. Thompson, of Point, has gotten himself into a little trouble that he hardly anticipated when he made his| report of his wonderful crop of four bales on an acre. The story has been published in pretty nearly half the newspapers of South Carolina, and is now appearing in the papers of other states. It will probably be read all over the south. As the result, Mr. Thompson complains that his mail is growing so large that he cannot spare the time to attend to it. But he has taken a good way to get relief. The statement he publishes today is scarcely less interesting than the first report, and will probably be as widely published. Readers who had not thought about the matter before, will thus be made to realize the embarrassment that such a flood of letters is likely to occasion to a plain farmer, and in the event of their failure to get answer to their inquiries, will probably not be offended. ? Having already passed through the Carolinas, Georgia, and Alabama, the party of New York bankers, manufacturers and merchants who came down south some weeks ago to look into tbe industrial condition of this section, is now in Tennessee. At Chattanooga, a few days ago, Mr. S. M. Milliken, of the firm of Deeming, Milliken A Co., of New York, and a member of the party, expressed himself as follows:' "We have found the south a very inviting field for investment in the matter of cotton affairs. You have the cotton at your very doors, and your labor is not so well employed as in the east. Besides this, your labor is the home article, and therefore more contented, more tractable, and willing to work for reasonable pay." It is hardly probable that this trip was made for nothing, and although what Mr. Milliken says is in a very few words, it means a great deal. These men having seen for themselves what the south is doing, notwithstanding its woeful lack of capital, and have no doubt also seen numerous opportunities for profitable investment. These capitalists will return ere long and they will be accompanied by others. 

MERE-MENTION. Martin Thorn, who was convicted in New York last week of the murder of Win. Guldensuppe, was sentenced, on Friday, to be electrocuted during the week beginning January 10, 181)8. Emanuel J. Lasara, a saloon keeper, and his wife, were arrested in New York one day last week on the charge of smuggling ?100,000 worth of diamonds into the United States.

Reports from Kansas are to the effect that several rivers are drying up as the result of the long drought that has been prevalent over most of the state. The river bed at the junction of the Neosho and Cottonwood rivers, is reported to be as dry as a desert. The fillibuster shooner Dauntless made another successful trip to Cuba last week with a cargo of arms and ammunition. ? The christening of the United States battleship Kentucky, is the SUUJUUb U1 it Ul^ ftUC'Iill 1 U W III tllC state after which the ship is to be named. About a year ago, Secretary Herbert announced that he had selected Miss Hattie Bain bridge Richardson, a beautiful young society woman of Lexington, as sponsor for the vessel. It was later given out that instead of wine, a hottle of Keutucky whiskywould be used in the christening. This last announcement raised a storm of protests from the temperance people all over the country ; but the storm finally died down. Not locg ago Governor Bradley announced that he had selected his daughter to christen the vessel, and this raised another big howl; but not on the whisky question. Miss Richardson is making the fuss. She is out in the papers in an abusive tirade against Governor Bradley, and is trvimr to make it warm for that ollicial. Authorities on the etiquette controlling such matters, say that the governor of Kentucky has nothing to do with the selection of a sponsor to christen the vessel. That this u is matter that is entirely within the province of the secretary of the navy. Juilge Cotlirun I)e:i(l.

The registration books were open od Monday and Tuesday, and will continue open today, after which the "understanding" clause of the constitution becomes a dead letter. From January 1, 1898, registration can only be had under the following conditions: "That he [the applicant] can both read and write any section of this constitution submitted to him by the registration officer, or can show that he owns and has paid all taxes collectible during the previous year on property in this state assessed at $300 or more." The total registration on last Monday was in the neighborhood of 25, and according to the statement of members of the board of registration, included more voters than had been registered during the entire year previous. . ABOUT PEOPLE. Mr. T. G. Gulp has been appointed second vice-president for York county, of the South Carolina Good Roads association. Major A. II. White is first vicepresident. Mr. Herod Neal, the well-known auctioneer. is now located in Yorkville. Members of bis family have held positions at the cotton factory for several weeks; but he only arrived last week. Mr. Marion Knowles, the genial and courteous special agent of the Delaware Fire and Marine, and the Pennsylvania Fire Insurance companies of Philadelphia, was in Yorkville from Friday of last week until last Monday morning looking after the interests of his companies. Mr. O. J. Gwin, superintendent of New Bethel Sunday school, was presented by his pupils last Sunday with a handsome pair of gold spectacles. Mr. Gwin is a great singer. Although he would probably not admit it, he is getting along where he cannot see as well as he used to. The young people appreciated the fact. Hence the present. IT WAS A DRAW GAME. A smart swindler, whose principal field of operations is among the cotton factories, played a slick game on Messrs. Grist Cousins, of Yorkville, on Monday; but from subsequent developments, it appears that they at least managed to bring about a draw. During Monday afternoon, the fellow, who was decently clothed and a man of very good address, presented himself to Mr. D. W. Hicks, represented that he had work at the cotton mill, but no money, .....I Itufl tw.m? rupimitiiRiulftfl hv SlIDerill tendent Grimes to call down and make arrangements for credit. His story, in most particulars, seemed plausible enough, and Mr. Hicks sold him goods to the amount of $2.45, and charged them, as instructed, to James Wooten. About two hours alter this, there was a ring at the 'phone, and Mr. W. H. Barron, the engineer at the cotton mill, gave information to the effect that the alleged Wooten was a well-known swindler, whom he had seen before under the alias of "Griffith," and also that tho fellow had sold the goods, just purchased, for $1, and taken the train for Blacksburg. Upon this information, Messrs. Grist Cousins applied to Chief of Police Love, who immediately wired Chief Duncan, of Blacksburg, a description of the fellow, and asked for his arrest. Yesterday morning Chief Duncan telegraphed that the man had been arrested according to instructions ; but that during the night he had burned the guardhouse and made his escape. Wooten, or Griffith, has quite a reputation among the mill operatives all through the Piedmont section as an accomplished blackleg and swindler, and those on the lookout for him may assure themselves of his identity by means of scissors, clippers and razor tattooed on one of his I wrists. COTTON GROWERS' CONVENTION. The cotton growers of York county will hold themselves in readiness to endorse and carry out whatever plans may be adopted at the convention to be held in their interest in Atlanta on December 14. This is the sum and the substance of the action of the convention which met in the courthouse at Yorkville last Monday. The York county convention, called by Mr. W. N. Elder under instruction from the State Convention of cotton growers, held in Columbia on November 10, met in the courthouse on Monday pursuant to appointment. There were present about 75 representative farmers from the various townships in the county, and all appeared to he desirous of doing whatever the majority might seem to think was best calculated to promote their common interests. The convention was called to order by Mr. W. N. Elder, who, after explaining the authority under which it was assembled and the reasons therefor, asked for reports from representatives of the res peetive townships. In the absense of Mr. D. G. Stanton, who had been appointed as the representative of Bethel township, Mr. Meek Barnet reported that the farmers of his section were generally in favor of organization. Mr. J. Frank Ashe reported that Bcthesda was awaiting the action of this convention, ready and willing to do whatever might be recommended. Mr. J. K. Leech made a similar report in regard to Broad .River township, and Mr. J. C. Blair answered in a like manner for Bullock's Greek. For Catawba township, Mr. J. B. Rawls reported that farmers and merchants were in hearty sympathy with the proposed movement, and would do all they could to in ake it a success. Mr. W. J. Miller said that Ebenczer was manifesting considerable interest, and was ready to do all that might be reasonably required of her. M r. C. T. Crook reported that a largely attended meeting was held in Fort Mill last Saturday. The whole subject had been discussed with a great deal of inter- j est. It was estimated that, taking the township over, the farmers were in the habit of planting about 25 acres of cotton to the plow. While it was the sense of the meeting that this acreage should be reduced, it. was not thought best to reduce it too rapidly, and it was agreed that a reduction to about 15 acres to the plow would be about the right thing. The general sentiment, however was as had been expressed by Captain S. E. White. Although one of the largest farmers in the township, ho announced that if the Atlanta convention should decide upon reduction of the acreage as the proper thing, he would make whatever reduction might be recommended, even to the extent of not planting a single seed. Mr. Crook went on to say that his people thought there was something else necessary beyond a reduction of the acreage, and that they believed also in the wisdom of adopting what is known as the Roddey plan. He said also that a resolution had been adopted in condemnation of the cylindrical baling machinery, controlled by the American Cotton company. If the American Cotton company is allowed to establish itself throughout the south, then it will be only a short time uutil we will be forced to market our cotton in the seed only, and conditions will become even worse than now. Mr. W. J. Davis said that the people of King's Mountain township banked more on the Roddey plan than they did upon a reduction of the acreage. The proposed reduction of the acreage might very well be illustrated by the conditions prevailing in the convention. Here there are a number of us who are trying to discover what is best for our common interest, and outside are hundreds who have manifested no interest in this movement; but are merely waiting to get the advantage of whatever we might be able to do for them. If we should succeed in securing promises of a big reduction of the acreage, there would be hundreds of planters everywhere who would seek to take advantage of our efforts by increasing their crops. However, whatever the majority, might decide upon, King's Mountain township would be found in line. Mr. L. R. Williams reported that so far as he had been able to learn, the people of York township were in favor of the adoption of the Roddey plan and the reduction of the acreage. After the delivery of these reports, Mr. C. T. Crook made a brief speech in favor of a reduction of the acreage and the adoption of the Roddey plan. His main idea about the reduction of the acreage was that after the farmer raisea an me bread and meat necessary to run his place, he might be at liberty to raise as much cotton as he could, or wanted to raise. The only objection that he had heard raised against the Roddey plan was a fear that Mr. Roddey might make money out of it. He did not see where Roddey could make anything until after he bad benefitted the producers, and if the producers were benefitted at the same time, be did not care if Roddey should make millions. Upon motion of Captain W. H. Edwards, it was unanimously resolved to go into the organization of the York County Cotton Growers' association. Mr. W. J. Miller nominated Mr. L. R. Williams for president, and Mr. Williams nominated Mr. W. N. Elder. Mr. Elder begged to decline the nomination ; but an election was entered into by ballot, with the result that Mr. Elder received 29 votes and Mr. Williams re ceived 43. Mr. J. F. Ashe was unanimously elected secretary. On motion of Mr. W. J. Miller, the president was requested to appoint nine vice-presidents?one from each township ?each vice-president to act as his respective township chairman, and be authorized to appoint six committeemen to assist in the work of thorough organization. In accordance with this motion, vice-presidents were appointed as follows : Bethel?D. G. Stanton. Bethesda?P. M. Burris. Broad River?W. M. McGill. Bullock's Creek?T. A. Gwinn. Catawba?T. M. Allen. Ebenezer?W. J. Miller. King's Mountain?W. J. Davis. York?N. A. Simril. The following, offered by Mr. W. J. Miller, was unanimously adopted: Resolved, That we recommend a reduction of the cotton crop to ten acres to the plow, and, further, that we consider the adoption of what is know as the Roddey plan as indispensible to the best interests of the cotton producers of the south. It was explained that this resolution was merely intended as an expression of the sentiments of the people of this section, to be sent up to the convention to be held in Atlanta on December 14, and that whatever might be determined upon by the Atlanta convention, would be acquiesced in by the farmers of York county. Mr. D. M. Hall took occasion to make a few remarks. He said that a few years ago, when the situation grew so bad that to raise cotton seemed impossible, the farmers got together and passed resolutions in favor of the reduction of the acreage and tbe adoption of the Roddey plan, etc. As the result of the agitation, or anyhow for some reason, the crop was reduced and prices got better. But when cotton began looking up again toward eight cents, the farmers began to plant tbe whole earth as they had done before, and made things as bad as ever. If this organization was to be a permanent thing it would have his hearty sympathy and cooperation ; but if it were to be only a temporary expedient?a going up the hill and down again?he wanted nothing to do with it. Ho hoped that all the cotton growers everywhere would be interested and that they would stick permanently. Mr. C. T. Crook frequently interrupted the remarks of Mr. Hall with "Amen." There being no further business, upon motion of Mr. Elder, the convention adjourned to hold its next meeting in the courthouse, on the first Monday in January, 1S!>8. By the next meeting, it is hoped that organization will be completed in all the townships, and that each township will send a full representation of duly accredited delegates. 

GOOD SHOWING THIS. The following interesting story appears in The News and Courier of last Friday, from the Yorkville correspondent of that paper: Mr R N. Moore, of Yorkville. is. by occupation, a cotton buyer and merchandise broker, and also a "bustler." Several years ago he purchased a plantation about two miles north of town, and did some successful farming on it, but was not so successful as he desired, owing to the fact that he could not give it his undivided attention. About three years ago Mr. W. J. Gordon, who owned a small plantation adjoining that of Mr. Moore, and who had proven himself to be a complete success as the manager of a twohorse farm, sold his place for a handsome proiit over and above cost. When Mr. Gordon sold out Mr. Moore prevailed on him to take charge of his place, and work it on the "shares" system. A part of the place?about 100 acres? which Mr. Moore bought about the time the arrangement was made between him self and Mr. Gordon, was considered al- < most worthless, and had it not had a good | and substantial dwelling house on it and been eligibly located within two and a half miles of town, would not have brought more than $5 per acre. Mr. Gordon went to work on land on which others had failed to make a living, and the first year made a fairly good crop, and the next year he made a still better one, and this year the results should put to shame any farmer who has good land, stock, tools, etc., and has failed to make money. Mr. Gordon works four horses regularly, and when occasion demands , puts in a tilth. It may be said with truth that he work- 1 ed a four-and-a-half-horse crop, and here ! is what he made: Sixty bales of cotton, of the average weight of 450 pounds, 850 bushels of corn, 150 bushels of wheat, gathered 50 bushels of peas, 10 tons of peavine hay, 8,000 bundles of fodder, and when hog killing time is over will have at least 3,000 pounds of home-raised pork. The cotton is not the 5-cente kind either. as Mr. Moore sold it last spring or summer, for future delivery, to a cotton factory at 7J cents per pound, and estimating the other products at their market price, the, gross value of all is about 8|3050. Mr. Gordon is one of the few farmers who can always And something to do on the farm. At present he has a couple of two-horse turning plows at work, breaking the land for the crop he expects to raise next year. 

LOCAL LACONICS. The Price of Cotton. The price of cotton on the Yorkville market yesterday ranged from 51 cents downward. At a Klpe Old Age. Mrs. Margaret Grier died at her home in Harrisburg, N. C., last Sunday, aged 90 years. She was the widow of the late Andrew Grier, and mother-in-law of Colonel W. H. McCorkle, of Yorkville. The funeral took place in Charlotte on yesterday. Tax Collections. Treasurer Neely had, on Monday, the biggest day's collection of taxes that he has had so far this season. The taxpayers, however, are woefully behind, and there is reason to believe that the rush during the last daysof December will be as heavy as is usual. Under Dispensary I.aw. Pursuant to a provision of the dispensary law, Mr. W. H. Newbold, late state detective, on last Monday, sold ahorse and buggy confiscated as the property of Edward C. Caton, who was arrested in Fort Mill township, some weeks back,) while transporting contraband liquor. The buggy was t>ought by Mr. J. L. Starr ? * i t.~ vr_ w T lor QZZ.w ana me nurse uy uu. n. *. Nichols for $46.50. Auction Sale*. There was only one auction sale by the clerk last Monday, salesday for December. Under foreclosure in the case of Elizabeth A. Parish and others, plaintiffs, against W. Butler Black and others, defendants, the clerk sold 180 acres of land in King's Mountain township. Bought by J. S. Brice, attorney, for $3 an acre. Also in the same case, the same official sold a tract of 20 acres, located on the waters of Clark's Fork. Bought by Mrs. Lacy Caldwell for $71. Fire Lou Settled. Mr. Marion Knowles, special agent of the Pennsylvania Fire Insurance company, came to Yorkville last week and settled with Martha Eva Davies, for the recent loss of her house in Yorkville, by tire. The policy calls for $400, and the full amount will be paid without question. There was also, in another company, a $200 policy covering the furniture destroyed in the lire. This loss will also be settled within a few days. In Reference to Pensions. The state board of pensions has just issued the following circular to the chairmen of the various county boards: "Dear Sir?Your attention is directed to section 1 of the pension law of 1897, which provides for a meeting of the township i pension boards. You will at once give notice to your townsnip Doarus to mon on the third Monday, January 17, 1898, and consider all the new applications for a pension and revise the roll of 1897. The township boards will give their reasons for dropping any names from the roll. The pension boards elected in 1897 will serve until August, 1898.

IT PAID HANDSOMELY. Made Four Bales of Cotton on an Acre and Netted u Profit of 864.78. Editor of The Yorkvllle Enquirer: In your issue of December 2, I note a suggestion from The News and Courier to the effect that many people would proba-J bly be interested to know whether or not there was a profit in the crop of four bales which I recently gathered from an acre of ground. At the time of writing the re port, it did not occur to me but what I was sufficiently explicit on this subject to enable any cotton raiser to figure the whole matter out for himself, and with entire satisfaction; but if you will kindly allow ine the space, I will be pleased to go into further details. The crop paid me, and it paid handsomely. Here are the figures for fertilizing: 1,033 pounds Charlotte acid, 8 6 71 433 pounds kainit, 3 24 233 soluble guano, 2 09 50 bushels cotton seed, 5 00 G two-horse loads stable manure, 3 00 Total, 8 20 04 Now comes in the labor.

The cost of my cotton, it will be seen, was not quite 3 cents a pound. This I know is so low as to be almost beyond belief with many farmers; but in my opinion it is easily possible to make further reductions in the cost. Now, before I conclude, allow me to make another observation. As the result of my report already published, I have been literally overwhelmed with letters asking for cotton seed and for various poiuts of information. In regard to the cotton seed, I will do the best I can to carry out my mposition to send a pound to all who se..d me 12 cents with which to pay postage; but I cannot undertake to auswer all of the letters that I am re solving. This I regret very much; but positively I cannot spare the time. Respectfully, E. d. Thompson. Point, S. C., December 3,1897. McKINLKY TO CONGRESS. President's Message Head lu House and Senate on Monday. The annual message of President McKinley wus read to the house and 9enute on Monday. It is a lengthy document; but entirely devoid of seusation. Iudeed, all of the more important. features of it had leaked out sev eral days before the reading, and there was nothing left in it to occasion surprise. The first question taken up is that of currency reform. The president goes into an exhaustive review of the different bond issues that had been made, and as a remedy recommends that as soou as the receipts of the government are quite sufficient to pay expensesjof the government, that when any United States notes are presented for redemption in gold aud are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set upart and only paid out in exchange for gold. "If the holder of the Uuited States notes prefers the gold aud gels it from the government, he should uot receive back from the goverraneut a Uuited States note without paying gold in exchange for it." The president is in favor of what is known as the Gage national bank scheme. Ou this subject, umoog other things, he says: "I concur with the secretary of the treasury in bis recommendation that national banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of the bouds which they have deposited for circulation, and that the tax on circulating notes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one-half of one per cent, per unuuin. I also join him in recorainendiug that authority be given for the establishment of national banks with a minimum capital of $25,000. This will enable the smaller villages and agricultural regions of the country to he supplied with curreucy to meet their needs. I recommend that the issue of national bauk notes be restricted to the denomination of $10 and upwards. If the suggestions I have herein made shall have the ap proval of congress, then I would recommend that uutional banks be required to redeem their notes in gold." Next, there is a lengthy discussion of the war iu Cuba as the result of which be concludes: "I regard the recognition of the belligerency of Cuban insurgents as now unwise; and, therefore, inadmissible. Should that step hereafter he deemed wise, as a matter of right and duty, the executive will take it." Of the coucentration policy of Weyler, he says : "It has utterly failed as a war measure. It is not civilized warfare? it is exterminating." He says forcibly annexation canuot be thought of as that would be criminal aggression. The relatious between the United States and Hawaii are dealt with at < length, and the president expresses himself as emphatically in favor of the annexation of the Hawaian islands, giving the inhabitants full rights of American citizenship. The president says of the inter-national monetary commission that, notwithstanding dilligent efforts, the euvoys have failed so far to secure an agreement. Gratification is expressed at the action of France in this matter, in joiuing in our efforts, and it is said that the negotiations are still pending. Meanwhile, the envoys have not made their final report, believing that the doubts raised in certaiu quarters respecting the feasibility of maintaining parity between gold and silver may yet be removed. Iu concluding his message, the president promises to uphold the civil service laws, and makes the usual recommendation as to a reduction of expenses, etc. 

RKADY FOR*THE SHOW. How Things Looked on the Eve of the Convening of Congress. Washington Cor. News and Courier, Sunday. When congress assembles tomorrow, ' nearly all of the star performers iu both branches of the natioual legislature will be in their respective places. In the senate, the familiar face and tigure of Mark Hanna will be seen on the back row. Mr. Hanna, although far from being a well man, arrived here tonight, pretty well used up in consequence of his hard fight for reelection. His colleague, Senator Foraker, is also here ; but the two senators from Ohio did not come by the same train, although they are quartered at the same hotel. Senator Joues, of Arkansas, chair- t man of the Democratic national committee ; Daniel, of Virginia, fresh from home with a unanimous vote of bis party caucus, which insures his re-election for another term of six years; Gorman, of Maryland, whose senatorial career ends with this congress, are here ready lo fight for anything supposed to be favorable to the Democratic party. The brilliant Wolcott, who went abroad with the monetary commission, has been keeping very quiet siuce his return ; but it is under- < stood that be has some interesting information concerning his visit to Europe, which he will present to the senate in debate at un opportune moment. On the other side of the chamber, Tillman, of South Carolina, the "Kuight of the Pitchfork," may be ex- i pected to break out at any time with a demand for au investigation of the the sugar scandals. His colleague, Senator McLaurin, proposes to open the financial ball by introducing a bill to provide for the repeal of the 10 per ceut. lax on state banks. He thinks his bill will Opeu up the discussion of the entire financial question ; but he is about to be mistaken, for the most conservative members of the senate do \ not look for auy radical legislation during the coming session. , Senator Allen, of Nebraska, the " Populist leader, who holds the record for loug speeches in the senate, and Senator Butler, the youthful "Pop" from North Carolina, who is a close second as a time-consumer, are loaded with "views" on every conceivable subject, and they are liable to unload their so-called thought iu the Congressional Record. At the house end of the Capitol, Speaker Tom Reed looms up head aod
