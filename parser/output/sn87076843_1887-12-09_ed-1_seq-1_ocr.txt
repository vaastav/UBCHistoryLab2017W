By this means new outbreaks havo been almost entire ly prevented. From tho beginning et tho work for tho eradication of this disease. In August, l&a, to October 31, 1P87, tho inspectors of tho bureau have Inspected 13.337 herds, containing 117, 480 animals, In districts whero tho plaguo was supposed to exist.

The number of animals found affected by this d scaso and tho number or infected herds wore much greater than had been anticipated, and tbe work for its control has subsequently required a correspond'nqly larger forco aart greater ex penditure of money.

If tho State authori ties continue their cooperation as at prosent, which there Is ctery reason to expect, audit an appropriation Is made by x-ongress equnl to that of the present fiscal year, and with author ity for Its similar uso. It Is believed that this dangerous plague can bo exterminated by tho end of tho next fiscal yenr," Tho Commissioner says it fs yet too oirly to make an official atntcment of the results In de tail of the present year's experiments in tho development of sorghum-sugar manufacture, but thnt enough Is known already to enablo this country to anticipate an early success of tho enterprise. The experiments In sllk-rccltng havo not yet reached tho point nt paying thctr own expenses, but that vrns hardly to bo hoped for with a plant so limited. Another yenr's cxpcrlcnco.

To the Conprss of the United States l You are confronted at tho threshold ef 7onr If frtsKtlvQ duties with a condition or tho Nn tlonal finances, which imperatively demands immediate- nnd careful consideration, Tho amount of money annually exacted, through the operation of present laws, from tho Industries nnd necessities of tho people, largely exceeds the sum necossary to meet the ex penses of the Oovernmrnt. When we consider that tho theory of our institutions guarantees to every eltl7en tho full e njojment of all tho fruits of his industry and enterprise, with only such deduction as may be his sharo tow anl 1 tho careful and economical malntenancoof the Gov ernment which protects him. It is plain that tho exaction or more than this is indefensible extortion nnd a culpable betrayal of American fairness and Justice. This wrong Inflicted upon those who bear the burdens of National taxa tlon, like other crones, multiplies n brood of evil consequences. Tho public treasury, which Rhmild only exist ns a conduit conveying the peo ple's tribute to Its lettltlmate objects expendi ture, becomes a hoarding place for money nrod lessly withdrawn from trade nnd tho people's uso, thus crippling our National energies, sus pending our country's development, preventing Investment In productive enterprise, threaten ing financial disturbance and Inviting schemes of publlo plunder, condition or nin xnnAsnnv. This condition of our Treasury is not alto ccthernew, and it has more than once of late ben submitted to the people's representatives In Congress, who nlono can apply n romedy. And yet tho situation still continues, with ag gravated ine Idonts, more thin ever propping financial convulsion and wide spread disaster. It will not do to neglect this situation because Us dangers are not palpably imminent and ap parent. They exist none tho les certainly and await the unforeseen nnd unexpected occasion, when suddenly they will bo precipitated upon ur. On then jth day of June, ihs, tho excess of revenues over public CTpendltures, after ennv plying with the annual requirement of the Sink ing hind act, was tlT.K.iiTA'i 04: durlngthr vear ended June 30, 1883, such excess amounted to Mo.405.3Wsn, nnd during the year ended June to, 1837, it reached tho sura ot to.V307.8IO 34. THE 

SINKING FCND. The nnnunl contributions to tr sinking fund during tho three years above perl fled, amount ingln tho aggregate to J13s,W.s.ti(.iM, nnd do. ductod from tho surplus as stated, were mado by calling in for that purposo outstanding three rer cent, bonds of tho Oovornment. During tho six months prior to June 3 1 W, tho surplus revenue had grown so largo by repealed ac cumulations, and it was feared the withdrawal ot this great sum of money needed by the people, wouldsoatToetthob iStnessarthe country, that the sum of $70,50l,103 of such surplus wns Ap plied to tho payment of tho principal and In tcrcst of tho three por cent, bonds still out standing, and which were then parablo at tho option of tho Government, The precarious con dition of financial affairs among till pcopln still needing relief. Immediately after thoiWth day of June, IKS", tho remalnd-r ot the three per cent, bonds then outstanding, amounting with principal and interest to tho sum of SIR 877,.Vio, wero c.illed in and applied to the sinking fund contribution for the current tlso.il year. Notwithstanding these operations nf tho Treasury Department, representations of dis tress tn business circles not onty continued but Increased, and absolute peril seemed at hand In thene circumstance tho contribution to the sinking fund of the current flscnl year was at once compl-ted by the cspondltnrc of U7.C8V 5S3.M In the purchaso of Government bonds not yet duo bearing four and four and a h.tlf per cent, interest, the premium pild thereon aver aging about twenty-tour per cent, for the former and eight percent, for the latter. In addition to this the interest accruing during tho current year upon tho outstanding bonded In debtedness ot the Go eminent was to somo ex tent anticipated and banks selected as deposit ories of publlo money were permitted to some- Tni increase meiraoposus. wiiiic ine expedi ents thus employed to release to the people tha money lying Idle in the Treasury served to aert Immediate danger, our surplus revenues have continued to accumulate, the excess for tho present 3 ear amounting on the 11 rU day of December to tr.s.SM.TOI.Pi, and estimated to reach tha sum of 

$1I10VKM on the SOihof June next, at which date It is ex pected that this sum, added to prior accumula tions, will swell the surplus in tho Treasury to 9140 000.000. Thero seems to bo no assurance that, with such a withdrawal from uso of the people's circulating medium, our business com munity may not In tho near future bo subjected to tho same distress wh'ch was quite lately produced from the samo cause. And whilo the functions of our National Treasury should be few and simple, and while its best condition would be reached, I believe, by its entire dis connection with priistte business Interests, yet when, by a perversion of its purposci.it idly holds money uselessly substrneted from the channels of trade, there seems to be reason for the claim thnt omo legitimate means should bo devised by the Government to restore. In an emergency, without waste or oxtravagancc, such money to its place among the people. DisrosAL or tnr. scnri.un. If such tin emergency arises there now exists no clear and undoubted power of executive relief. Heretofore tho redemption of three per cent, bonds, which were payable nt tne option of the Government, has af forded a means for the disbursement of the excoss of our revenues; but these bonds have all been retired and there are no bonds outstanding tho payment ot which we have the right to insist upon. Tho contribution to the sinking fund which fuinlshos the occasion for expenditure In tho purchase ot bonds his been already made for tho current year, so that there Is no outlet in that direction. In the present state ot le Islation tho only pretense of any existing executive power to re store, at this time, any part of our surolus reve nues to the people by its expenditure consists In tho supposition that tho Secretary of tho Treasury may enter tho market and purchaso the bonus of the Government not yet due, at a rate of premium to bo agreed upon. The provision ot law from which such a power could bo derUod is found In an appropriation bill passed a number ot years ago; aad u is subject to the suspicion that it was intended as temporary and limited In its application, instead ot conferring a continuing discretion and au- 1 no my. no conuiuon ougnt 10 exist wmen would Justify the grant ot power to a single official, upon hia Judgment of its necessity, to withhold from or release to tho business of tho people, In an unusual manuer, money held in the Treasury, and thus affect, at his will, tho financial situation of the country, and if It is deemed wIm to lodco in the SAorutnry of tbe Treasury tho authority in tho present juncture to purchase bonds, it (hould be plainly vested and provided as far as possible, with such checUs and limitations as will dctlno this otlichi's right and discretion, and at the samo tlmo relieve him from undue responsibility. In considering tho question of purchasing bonds as a me.ins ot restoring 'to circulation tlio surplus money accumulating in the Treasury, it should be borno in mind that pre miums must of course be paid upon such pur chase, that thero may be a 1 irgo part of thoso .bonds held as investments which can not bu purchased at any price, and that combinations among holders who are willing to sell, may un reasonably enchanco the cost of such bonds to tho Government, It has been suggested that tho present bonded debt might bo refunded at n less rata ot 1 .it crest, and the difference between the old and new security paid In cash, thus finding uso for tho surplus in tho Treasury. Tbo success or this plan. It is apparent, must depend upon the voli tion ot the holders of tho prosent bonds; and it is not entirely certain that tho inducement which must bo offered thorn would result in more financial bnnellt to the Government than tho purohase of bonds, whilo tho latter proposl tlon would reduce tho principal of tho debt by actual payment, Instead of extending it. Tho proposition to deposit tho money held by the Government in banks throughout the coun try, for uso by the people, is. it seem? to me, exceedingly objectionable In principle, as establishing too close a relationship between the operations of tho Government treasury and the business of the country, and too extensive a commingling of their money, thus fostering an unnatural reliance in private bublnessupon pub llo funds. If this scheme Bhould be adopted It should only ba done as a temporary expedient to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and ex ecutive efforts should generally bo in the op posite direction and should havo a tendency to divorce as much and as fust us can safely bq done, the Treasury department from prit ato tn terpiise. Of course, it is not expected taut unnecessary and extravagant appropriations will be mado fiir tho purpasu of avoiding the accumulation of an excess of revenue Such expenditure, be side the demoralisation ot nil )ust conception of publlo duty which it entails, stimulates a habit of reckless Improvidence not in the least con sistent with tho mission of our peoploor the high and beneficent purposes of our Government. nnAviTY or thk financial situation. I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my countrymen, as well as to the attention of their representatives charged with tho responsibility of legislative relief, tho gravity of our financial situation. Tho failures of thu Congress heretofore to provide aguinst the dangers which it was quite evUent tho very nature of the difficulty must neves lurlly pro duce, cnused a condition or UnancUl dUtross and apprehension since y ur last adjournment, which taxed to tho utmost all tho authority und expedients within executive control; and theso appear now to bu exhausted. It disaster resul s from the continued inaction of Congress, the responsibility must rcBt where it belongs. Though the situation thus far considered is fraught with dungcr which should be fully re alized, and though it prosents features of wrong to the people us well us peril to tho country, it is but a result growing out of a per fectly palpable and apparent cause, con stantly reproducing the same alarm ing circumstances a congested National treasury and u depleted monutary condition in tho business of thu country. It need hardly be stated that while tbo present situation demands a remedy, wo eun only bu saved from a like pro dlo.iment In the future by tho removal of its CdUSO. ouurncsnNT TAniM' laws. Our schema of tsxatlon, Dy means of which this needless surplus is taken from tho people ind nut into tho public treasury, consists of a arlff or duty levied upon Importations from ibroad, and internal revenue t4xes levied upon bocouaumptlonof tobacco and spirituous and malt Upiorst Jt (oust bo 9pn.ccd.td lha( nvqo Of tho things subjected to Internal revenue taxa tion are, strictly speaking, necossnrlcs; there appears tn bo no Just complaint ot this taxation by the consumers of these articles, nnd thore seems to bo nothing so well able to bear tho burden without hardship to any portion of the people, nut our present tariff laws, the vicious, ino qui tab, 0, und Illogical source of unnecessary taxation, ought to he at oneo revised and amended. These laws, ns thoir primary and plain effect, 

HAIHBTHK PntCE TO CONSUMERS of all articles imported and subject to duty, by frcctsely tho sum paid for such duties. Thus he amount of the duty measures tho tax paid by those who purohaso for uso theso imported articles. Many of thnso things, however, nrc raised or manufactured In our own country, and tho duties now levied upon foreign goods and products aro called protection to theso homo manufactures, boeauao they rondor It possible for those of our people who aro mnnufacturer to make these taxed articles and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for the Imported goods thnt havo paid customs duty. So it hap pens that, while comparatively row ue tho Im ported articles, millions of our people who never use nnd never saw any of the foreign products, purchase and uso things of tho samo kind made In this country nnd pay therefor nearly or quite the samo enhanced price which tho duty ndds to the imported articles. Those who buy Imports pay the duty charged therein Into the public treasury, but the great mnorlty of our cltUens who buy domestic articles of tho same class, pav a sum nt least approxi mately equal to this duty to the homo manu facturer. This refe enco to the operation of our tariff laws is not madi by way of instruc tion but In order that wo may bo constantly reminded ot the mannor In vv hlch they lmpoo a burden upon tltoe i ho consomo domestic prod uet, as well as thoo who consume imported arttclos, and thus create n tax upon all our people It is not proposed to entirely nRLIRVB THK CntJNTnY OF THIS TATATIOV. It must be extensively continued as the source of the Government's Ino me, nnd in a readjust ment of our tnrUT tho Interests of American labor engaged In mannfrcturo should be care fully considered, as well as tho preservation of our manufacturers. It may bo enllM protee t'on, or by nnv other name, but relief from tho hardships and dangers of our present tariff law should be devised, with especial pre caution mralnst imperiling tho existence of our manufacturing interests, nut this ex istence should not mean a condition nhlch, without regtrd tn tho publlo welfare or n National exigency, most always Insure tho realization of immense profits distent of moderately profitable returns. As the volume and diversity of our National activities lncicaie, now recruits nro aided to thoso whodnslre a con tlnuatlon ot the advantages which they conaelvo the present system of tariff taxation directly affords them. So stubbornly have all efforts to reform tlio present condition been resisted by those of our fellow citizens thus engaged, thnt they can hardly complain of ihe sasyuion. en tertained to n certain extent, that thero exists an nrgani7cd combination all along tho lino to maintain their advantage. Wo nro in tho midst of centennial celebra tions, nnd with hemming prl c wo rejoice In American skill and lniro'tulty, in American energy and enterprise and in tho wonderful natural advantaees and resources dcvoloned by a century's national growth. Yet when an at- lempi is maue 10 jusuiy a scnemo wnicn per mlts a tax to nn i.Ain upon nvnv nvruniim tn the land 'or iho benefit of our manufacturers, quite beyond a reasonable demand for govern mental regard. It snlts tho purposes of advocacy to call our manufactures Infant industries, still needing tho highest and greatest degree of rnvor and fosterin? care that can bo wrunj from Fed eral legislation. It is also said that the Increaso tn the price of domestic mnnuf icturea resulting from tlio pres ent tariff is necesHary inordrtrthat higherwages may be paid to our workinjmen employed in manufactories, than nro paid for what Is called mo pauper lanoroi liuropa. au wm nc Knowl edge the force ofan argument which involves the welfare nnd liberal compensation of our laborin ' pcop'e. Our labor Is honorable In the eyes of every American citizen, nnd s it lies at the foundation of our development nnd progress, it Is ontltlcd, without affectation or hypocrisy, to tho utmoFt regard. Tho standard of our laborers life should not he measured by that of any other count rv less favored, nnd they are entitled to their full share or all our advantages. ny the last census It is mndo to appear that of tho 17,TJ.0fll of population engaged In all kinds ot industries. 7,fi70,-T.M are employed in agricultural, 4.07 VWfl In professional and per sonal service (3.9-1 1,87a of whom aro domestic servants and laborers), while l,Mn,50 nro em ployed in trade and transportation, and 3,8.17,1 11 are classed as employed in manufacturing nnd mining For present purposes, however, Iho last num ber given should bo consldorably reduced.

To theso the appeal is made to snvo their em ployment and maintain thoir wages by resisting a change. There should be no disposition to answer such suggestions by the allegation that they arc ia a minority among thoso who labor, and thereforo shoull rorejjo nn atvantnge, in tho intercut of low prices for the majority; their compensation, us it may be affected by tho operation of tariff laws, should at all times ho scrupulously kept in view, and yet with slight reflection they will not overlook the faet that they aro consumers with the rest that thoy, too, have their own wants and those of their fami lies to supply fr9m their earnings, and that iho price of the necessaries or life, ns well ns tho amount of their wages, will regulate tho meas ure of their melf ire and comfort Dut THK HRnOCTION OP 

TAXATION demanded should he so measured ns not to necessltato or Justify cither he loss of em- filoymcnt by the workingman nor tho csscnlng of his wages, an 1 tho profits still remaining to the manufacturer, after a necessary readjustment, should furnish no excuse ror the sacrifice ot the inter ests of his employes either in their opportunity to work or In tho diminution of their compeni.a tlon. Nor can tho worUer in manufactures fail to understand that while n high tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow the payment of re munerative vvagea. It certainly results m a very large increase in the prico of nearly nil sorts of manufactures, which, in almost countless forms, he needs for the use of himself and his family. Ho receives nt tho desk of his emplojcr his wages, and purhaps before ho reaches hU homo Is obliged, in a purchase for family uso of an article which embraces his own labor, to return in the payment of tho increase in price which the tariff permit the bard earned compensation of many days of toll. Tho farmer nnd the agriculturist who manu facture nothing, but who piy the tnsrenod prico which thu tirifl imposes, upon every agri cultural implement, upon all ne wears and upon nil lie uses and owns, except tho lnuraaso ot tils flocks and herds nnd such things us his bus' andry produces from tho soil, is invited to aid in maintaining the present situation; an 1 ho is told tha a high duty on Imported wool is noccssary for the benefit of thoso viho have sheep to shear, in ordor that tho price of their wool maybe Increased. They, otcoursc, aro not reminded that tbe farmer whu has no sheep ts by this fcheme obliged In his purchases of clothing and woolen goods to rT 

ATIU1IUTBTOIII4VKLLOW FAUMElt as well as to the manufacturer and merchant; nor is any mention made of the fact thnt the shep-ownors themselves and thoir households mu&t wear clothing and usu other articles man ufactured from tho wool thoy sell at tariff prices and thus as consumer must return their share of this Increased price to the tradesman. I think it may be fairly assumed that a largo proportion of the sheep owned by tho firmers throughout tho country are round in small flocks numbering from twenty-fivo to fifty, Tiie duty on tho grade of lmportod wool which theso sheep yield is ten cents each pound If of the value of thirty cents or less, and twolvo cents if of tho valuo of more than thirty cents. If the Ubcrd estimate or six pounds be allowed for each llceco the duty thereon would bo sixty or boventy to cents, and .this may be taken as tho utmost enhancement of it) price to tho farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would thus represent tho Increaso 1 prico of the wool from twenty-five sheep and thirty six dollars that from the wool of fifty sheep, and at present values this addition would amount to about one third of its price, . If, upon its sulo, the f inner recelv es thU or a less tariff profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum, which In all its changes will adhere to It, until it reaches the consumer. When manufactured Into cloth and other goods and material for use, its oost is not only in ere ised to thu extent of the farmers tariff Croflf, but a further sum has been added for the enefit of thu manufacturer under the operation of other tariff laws. In tho moantlmu the day arrivos when thu farmer finds it necessary o Eurthaso woolen goods and material to clothe Imself und family for tho winter. When ho faces tho tradesman for that purposo ho discov ers that he is obliged not only to return in thu way of increased prices, his tariff prices on the wool he sold.and which then perhaps lies bo f oro him in manufactured form, but that he 

MUST AIM) ACONS1DKUAULKBUM TlllvllETO to meet a further increaso in cost caused by a tariff duty on the manufacture. Thus in tho end ho Is aroused to thu fact thut ho has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a result of tho tariff scheme, which, when ho sold his wool seemed so profitable, un increaso in prlue moro than sufficient to sweep away all tho tariff profit he received upon the wool bopioduced and sold. When tho number of farmers engaged lu wool raising is compared with all the farmers in tha country, and the small proportion they bear to our population is considered; when it Is made apparent i think in the cusu of a Urge part of those who own sheep, the benefit of TUB I'lf SENT TAiuirr ON WOOI W ILLUSOnY and abovo all, when It must bu conceded that the increaso of tho cost of living cuuned by such tnrlff becomes a burden upon thoso with moder ate means and the poor employed and unem ployed, the sick and well, and the young and old, und that It constitutes a tax which, with relentless grasp, is fastened upon tho oluthlug of every man. woman and child in tho land, reasons ape ougiresteiJ, w&y tug rcmgYal 9T P duotton of this duty should be included in a re vision of our tariff laws. In speaking of tho Increased cost to tho con sumer of our homo tnnniifa:tjros. resulting: from a duty laid on imported nnlclvi of tho samo description, tho fact Is not overlooked that competition among our domestic producers sometimes has tho effect of keeping the price of their products bel .w tho highest limit allowed by such duty. Hut It is notorious that this competition is too oficn strangled by combtna Llnna unite nrnr.ilent nt this time, and fro nuently culled trusts, which have for their object the regulation of tho supply and Srlce of commodities made and sold by mem nrs of the combination. The peopto can hardlv hope for any consideration In the operation of inoso geiun scnemos. IT, howover, in tho absence of such combina tlon, a healthy and free competition reduces tho price of nny particular dntinblo article of homo production, balow tho limit which it might, other wise reach under our tariff laws, nnd If, with such reduced price its manufacture continues to thrive, It Is entirely evident that one thine has been discovered which should be carefully scrutinized in nn effort to reduce taxation. Tho necessity of combination to malnt tin tho ?rlco of nny commodity to tho tariff point, unilshes proof that somo ono is willing to a" cept lower prices for such commod.ty, and that such prices are remunerative; oiud lower prices produce I by competition prove tin samo thing. Thus whore either of theso conditions exist, a ease would seem to be presented for an eawy reduction of taxation The considerations whlchhave been presented touching our tariff laws aro inteudud only to enforce AN EAHNTWT nttrOMMriNDVTIO that the surplus revenues of tho Gov mment In prevented by the reduct'oi of our cusl 4 duties, and, at the same il.no to umphisl -b suggestion that, la nccomptls'iln this pur oc. wo may disehaiga a double dutv to our co iplo by granting to them n mcisuic or relief fr ri tariff taxation in quarto is where It is most needed, a id Trom sources where it can be most fairly and Justly accorded. Nor can tho prcseatitlon of uch consllera tlons b with any degree of fairness rc:rar led as evidence of unfriendliness toward our ma i ficturinj Interests, or ot any lack or upprec'a tlon of their valuo and importance. Th sa Interests constitute a leading and moat sub st intlal clement of our national grentuess, mil furnish the proud proof of our country's prog ress. But If. In the em.e-'gcnclc- that prcs upon us, our m mufa -turers aro nkcd to surrender something for tho pubMc good, and to ivert dUnst r, their patriotism, as woll as n grateful recognition of a 1 vantages already' afforded. shrriM loid them to wt lin,t co-operation. No demand is mado that they shall foie?i all the benefits or governmental regard, but they can not fall to bo admonished of their duty, as well as their enlightened self-Inter st an I safoly when they are reminded of theftet that financial panic and collapse, to which the pres ent condition tends, alord no greater shelter or protection to our manufacturer than to our other impartnnt enterprises. Opportunity Tor sare, careful, and dcllbur.Us reform Is no a of fered nnd nona or us shoull bo unminlful of a, tlmo when nn abused and irritated peop'e, heed less or those who have rosisted timely an 1 rea sonable relief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification nf their wrongs. The utfuculty attending a wlso and fair re vision of our tariff laws Is not under sllm.itcd. It will require on the part of the Congress miEvr r.noi(. nij oaiik. nnd especially a broad and national contemnla tlon of the subject nnd a patrJntM ilfrP(-j-lni" such local and selfish clnlms as are u treason a Wo and recklo-s of tho welfare or tho cntl.-o country. Under our present laws more than four thou sand onirics uro subject to duty. Many of these do not In any way compete with our own manu factures, and many nro hardly worth nt'dntlon as subjects or revenue. A con8lder.ih'e reduc tion can be made in the aggregate by ad ting them to the free list. Tho taxation or luxuries presents no features of hardship, but tho neces saries of life used and consumed by all tho peo plo, tho duty upon which ndds to the cost of living in every home, should bo greatly cheap ened. The radical reduction of thodutlci imposed upon raw material used in manufactures, or its free Importation, is of eour30 an im portant factor in uny effoit to rrduco tho price of these necessaries; it would not only relieve them from the Increased cost caused by the tirlff on such material, but the manufactured product being thus cheap encd. that part of tho tnrlff now laid upon tuch product, as a compensation to our manufacturers tor tho present price of raw malerl it could bo accordingly modified. Such reduction, or froo importation would serve beside to largely reduce the revenue. It Is not apparent, how such a chnnge can have any Injurious effect upon our mnnuf .icturers. On tho contrary, it would ap pear to give them n llKTTKH ClIANCn IN 

FOUKIQN MAItttRTS with the manufacturers of other countries, who cheapen their wares by free rrutcrial. Thus our people might havo tho opportunity of ex tending their sales beyond tho limitation of home consumption saving them ftora tho de pression. Interruption in business and loss caused by a glutted domestic market, and af fording their employes moro certain and steadv labor with its resulting quiet nnd contentment. The question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approached in a kl'IUtTIIIliHEUTlIVNPAItriSANniP and considered In tho light of that regird for patriotism which should characterise the action of thoso intrusted with tho weal of a confiding people Hut the obligation to declare! party policy nnd principle Is not wantlug to urgo prompt and cffoctlvc,nction H0U1 of the groat political parties now represented in tho govern ment havo, by repeated and authoritative decla rations, condemned tho condition of our 1 iws which permit tho collection fro 11 tho people of unnecessary revenue, and have, in the most solemn manner, promised its correction, and noither as citizens or partisans are our country men In a mood to condone tho deliberate viola tion of those pledges. Our progress toward a wlso conclusion will not bo Improved by dwelling upon the theories of protection and free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets It Is a condition which confionts ui not a thuary. Hollef from this condition may involve a slight re duction of tho advautnei which vwi award our homo productions; but tho entire withdrawal or such advantagci should not be contempluteu. The question of frco trade is absolutely Irrelevant; aud the per slstont claim mado ia certain quarters, thatal efforts to relievo the people from unjust und unl necossary taxation are schemes of ho called Ireo traders, is mischievous aud far removed from uny consideration for tho publlo good. TUB SIM PUS AND PLAIN DUTY which wo owe tho people is to reduce taxation to the necessary expenses of an economical operation ot tho Government, and tu restoro to the business of thocountry tho money which wo hold in thu Treasury throu-jh the perversion of governmental powers. Theso tulngi can and should bo done with safety to allourludustriiM, without danger to thu opportunity fonrmunora tivc labor which our woiklngmcn need and with benefit to them and all our people, by cheapen ing their means of subsistence and iucreaaiu the measure of thoir comforts. BrATE OT TIIK UNION. The Constitution provides that the President "shall, from time to time, give to the Congicsd Information of tho statu of tho Union." It haa bejn thu custo 1 of thoexecutivo, in compllanco with this provision, to annually cxhlmt to tho Congross, nt the opening of its s sslnn, tho gen eral condition of the country, and to detail, with some p irticdarity, tho operations of the dif ferent executive department. It would be es pecially n?reeablo to follow this course at tho present time, and to call attention to the valua ble accomplishments of these departments dur ing iho last flsc il j ear. Uut lam so much im pressed with tho paramount impmancu of tho subject to which this communicat'on has thu far been devoted, that I shall forego tho a I dition of any other topic-, und only uro upon iur Immediate consideration the "statu of tlio Union" ns shown In tho picsent condition of oar Treasury and our general fiscal situation, upon which every element ot our safety anl prosperity depends. Tho roport i of the heads ot departments, whi-h will bo submitted, contain full nd ex plicit information touching the transactions of the business Intrusted to them, nnd such recom mendations relating to legislation In tho pnblio Interests as .they fleflin.ttdYisuUIu, t ask for these roporla, and re commend atlpns tha delib erate evnminmion and action ot tbo legislative branch of tho Government There are other subjects not embraced tn tho departmental report demanding legislative consideration, and which I should ho glad to submit, bomo of them, however, have been earnestly presented in previous murages, und as to them I beg leave to repeat prior recom mendations. As tho law makes no provision for any report from tho Department of State, a brier history ot the transactions of that important depart ment, together with other matters which it may hereafter bo demed esentl'ul to commend to the attention ot the Congress may furnUh tho occasion fora future communication.
