NATURE PAINTS U. S. FLAG The pretest red, white and blue flag (the standard of our great and glorious country) that was ever painted, barring none, was unfolded to view Saturday afternoon at 5:10 o'clock. It was not the work of a human being requiring days and weeks, but of a Supreme Being who placed it on the western sky line just at the end of a perfect day for all those waose ajre-i prone to look up, to see. It cToes not require a stretch of the imagination to de scribe th"s beautiful sunset scene re flected aganst the gentle clouds it was as real as hfe itself, and we will paint a word picture of the scene just as it appeared, with not a thing overdiawn, no matter how strange it may appear to those whose eyes were not in the "right place ' at the time. We were sitting in a little coun try home (at PhiilipWelborn's) rest ing from a three hours' tramp after rabbits. We were looking 5ut of the window at the fast sinking sun and just as the sun had "split itself in half beyond the western horizon we noticed the erstwhile lazy floating silver clouds take on coloring which from second to second grew more beautiful and when the last half of the sun was no more visible a halo of variegated colors spread out be fore the eye like a beautiful pano rama. Here were red, wbite'and blue stieaks and my, what deep, beauti ful colors, and there myriads of deep blue spots. The colors seem to quickly adjust themselves and we looked upon the scene spellbound until a beautiful red, white and blue flag with a sprinkling of blue stars was the result. There it rested as if held together by an omnipotent hand lear across the western horizon with the folds playing to the breeze, and looking close at the strange phe nomenon one could discern a figure 1 and 9 These were plainly formed we thought we could make out two other letters but we are giving the facts only in this case. Three other people at our request looked upon the scene. Such colors no mor tal eye ever saw before. We have seen many strange phenomenas in the heavens but never before our beautiful emblem which was fash ioned affer heaven's - beautiful col ors, no doubt, to bless mankind Every other nation on earth has a war symbol on its flag, but look at ours only the cobrs of heaven. Wonder if our flag is to be immor talized and emblazoned on the heavens in righteous indignation at the cruelties practiced by Germany and her hell -born aggregation. Since we were forced into the war and have announced to the world that we are not working for a selfish end but only for humanity, me thinks the God of us all has pidked Amer ica and her standard to carry out his purpose in this war. Who knows? Second call for Christmas shop ping. Answer with your presence at the stores. . as well as r-t dollars and It mpnnc . -c wise various ads Xfi a FRUGAUITV (by w. h. dugdale) TNDER existing conditions we are forced by circumstances over which we have no dirf mn. trol, to realize the evidences of real J war that surround us on all sides. With the young manhood of our na tion taking up the burden for the cause of justice and right, it is not a difficult task for us to realize the great duty i hat is of ne cessity laid at our door. Indeed it does not require any stretch of- the imag ination to draw a mind picture that will bring out in vivid colors the suffering and oriva tions that fall to the lot of the brave boys who are defending our home, our flag and our country and don't forget, it comes to them all, to a greater or less degree. No artist ever did or ever will put on canvas a true duplicate, as it is a picture no artist can paint. It matters not whether the suffering comes from wounds received in action, physical inability to stand up under the forced requirements, or inanition, the results are the same, and results are the prime motive for every ac tion. And -this is where frugality comes in. Whether from choice.or necessity, it is the duty of every man, woman and child to under stand and realize the importance of frugally. It is the rich man's mot to, it formed ihe rounds in the lad der on which he eiimbed to wealth; it is free, it does not :equire you to make any sacrifice detrimental to your own best interests, but it does ask you to waste not, to be conserv ative; it teaches the golden rule, and asks you to put yourself in the other man's place. Frugality will create a spirit in keeping with the times that will stimulate a d?ire to honor them that think no danger too great, no price too dear when true affection calls. Surely then you won t fail to cultivate frugality in this, our coun try's time of need. What a comfort It wiRbe to you when the noise : oflfer. This is conceded by all creeds battle is over and the awful tension has relaxed, to know that you have done your part, and may it be said of us as loyal Americans, "Well done, thou good and faithful ser vants. " It is within the possibilities of us all to grow stronger, and fru gality will do it. Study well your part and stick to your lines and by j concerted action and a steady pull; we can land the ship of peace in a ; f harbor Fteard the lion in his ! UUl V i J l- v w - w den and end for all time the power that rules with an iron hand, whose motto is "might over right." This must ail end. The time has come when the laws of God and man re pel against it, and it is up to us to - m 1 . i make good, and frugality is the j leaven in the loaf; it is (he salt ot tne issue; it adds -Spice and flavor to tne effort, and must be cultivated. It is not to be presumed that as a nation we are not frugal lar from it. fru gality has made iis what we are to day. What we need now is a greater effort and broader conception ana a better understanding oi its impor- rww, onrl nnlv nnrselves to the task then we win. We do not con sider any other result. Don't waste, don't over-buy, have enough but consider the other fellow. It is said of us that we waste enough every year to feed an army. This may or may not be true, but if thi statement could te substan- tiated it would require a powerful you to patronize. Kead ad. lot of frugality to offset it. However The Bank of Commerce announces ,L.Q;,o firfhHndnhnnPA that snmeian interesting event in regard to txxclc "&"-rr ----- -j nn anoweu meir iiitjiiiciija..a ability to get a little the better of thpir good iudgment. These state- mentsdo not weigh much and are a bone of contention, for argument only, and to the average mind has not much significance, but it is with in the scope of any one's conception to realize the importance of frugal ity. Your share may be the widow s rnite, but it is your contribution if you do your best, to the extent of your ability without creating auy hardship on yourself or others then you have done well Bear in mind some one is watching you, not as a spy but simply as a criterion to go by, to justify their action without regard to financial or social oppor tunities. Frugality is only one of a large family of personal accomplishments, of which thrift is the handmaid, pre paredness first cousin and activity the head. The trinity on which we base our hopes, and it all depends on us individvally and collectively V Ho our best. Our boys at ihe front expect it. On our frugality de-1 ofpeopk High Point, N. C, pends their welfare. Remember a lot of these boys left warm firesldei surrounded by every comfort, liv ing fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, and it is a long cry to the trenches "over there with he whiz of shot and shell as a lullaby to tired bodies. No mother's "ood night, son," no father's advice;tQ guide; all this carries the bov back home, and his environments do riot add much to his comfort. Frugality at home will do much to cheer him up and alleviate his sufferings, whether in the trench or on the cot in the hospital. j Do not imagine it is any picnic to undergo the strenuous training the boys must endure, the severe dis cipline they are subjected to, the 1 rules and regulations that govern a military camp On and off the field is quite as exacting as at college and the penalties are more severe for dereliction of duty and violation of military orders, but it produces good men, builds up character and teaches frugality, and the boy knows us vu,y ami nas aoiomg iaim in us efficacy. Be on the alert to discover any new opportunity, to use frugal ity; it is a willing ally and always responds. It may take a little sac rifice on our part, but what is that to the amount of good we may do for ourselves and others? Christ made frugality- an obiect - lesson when after feeding the five relative to making a substatial rail thousand with five loaves and to rad crossing on Main street and co fishes, He instructed his disciples to operating with the city in paving gather up the fragments and there Broad street. It is understood that were twelve baskets. Nothing went Mr. Miller will recommend the im to waste and it was a big crowd at provernents be made, that, It was the same spirit of fru- gality, tiie same brand, made and THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE delivered by the same power, "given President Wilson's speech before to us as a gift from God, and used Congres? Tuesday was a masterpieee by our Saviour at the will of him j of statecraft', abounding with love who sent him. All this is given to! for all and hatred to none, and is us free, without money and without j bound to strike a responsive chord price, and it is our privilege and j in the hearts of all true lovers of duty to use it. Don't mistake penuriousness for frugality they are contrary ele ments. The laws of God and man do not require it, nor will it be ac cepted only in the spirit in which it is given, for no man liveth to him self, anil the Lord loves a ctiejptfuj in all ages, and we can do no better than to follow its precepts. .Make frugality a part of our everyday life, live it, act ir, practice it and teach it. Scatter sunshine along the path way of life. Some one will benefit bv it. We cannot put sunshine enougn in our lives tu onsec me. a 1 - CD j1 snauows mat tne omer ienow win cast about us. Keep on the sunny side, practice frugality and you have struck the key-note that puts the whole world in tune and time the two great essentials for harmony. Frugality first, last and all the time. W.

Our people didnot realize the many advantages of this weekly system until it was launched and operated by our Home Bank for a year, but now there is hardly a ""n the llttte Qui ,li5,u u ... child even in town who does not ceiving a beautiful Santa Claus check during the holidays.
