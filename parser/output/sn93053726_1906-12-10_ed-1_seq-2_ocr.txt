MONDAY, DEC 10, 1906. ' -w - ' " ' ", . ' . ' The Sugar trust has just been fined $18,000 for accepting $28,000 worth of rebates.,: If the trust does not. look out the courts will catch up with it. Xews has been received at the war department of the . recent fight ; iu Leyte, in the Philippines, in which the American troops were badly cut up by an outfit of Bolo men. ; This is one of the lirliest fights that the war de partment has bad to record in. the past two years. , The insurgents were not really insurrectors at all, but rath er a stronger band than usual of the Ladrones who infest many of the isl ands., Some of them were armed with guns, but all bad the deadly bolos, in the use of which the nstlves are, very expert. They fired a volley at the troops and then rushed them with the sword, filling five before they were finally dispersed. Several of the sol diers who escaped death were badly Injured, but " the encounter is one which is not likely to be repeated again very soon. The Puljanes, the robber organisation which infested the island of Samar, has been effect ually broken up, and all the Informa tion that now conies to the war de partment Indicates that the Philip pines have entered an era of com parative peace combined with a fair amount of prosperity. The curious are looking forward to the annual auction of articles accum ulated iu the dead letter division of the postofflce department, which will begin on the 17th of this month, thus giving a bidder the chance of secur ing Christmas presents for friends at a price somewhat lower than that for which the same articles could be pur chased at a store. Last year the pro ceeds of the sale amounted to $7, 054.03, while the money taken out of letters amounted to $17,020. These two amounts were covered lutp the treasury. About live years ago some of the clerks, whose duties consisted of sorting and cataloging the articles to be sold, conceived a plan to buy valuable articles at ridiculously low prices. A package containing some cheap articles and perhaps a valuable watch or ring was prepared and cata- , logued as ."two neckties, a damaged ! shirt eto." The clerk would then make a note of the number of the package snd when that package came up for sale, the clerk or one of his friends would bid it In for little or nothing compared with the value. In spectors made 'an investigation and severs! clerks'lost their positions. An order was then issued that "etc" should not be used In the future and that the contents of each package should be accurately described. This year 0,531 packages of miscellaneous articles 1,289 of books and 439 of jewerly are to bo sold, which com prise almost everything from a baby rattle to a diamond ring. Many bills are being Introduced In congress every day, but there are only a few of them of real nitlontl Inter est One of the most important, and which stards a possibility of passing at tne present session, is thst by rep resentative Perkins of New York, embodying the Ideas of the president on the Inheritance tax. This bill Is not very drastic but is drawn with aa idea of withstanding the scrutiny of the supreme court. It provides for tax on an legacies of f23,inO or over. The amount assented varies with the cloeeneea of kin between the testator and legatee. In ease of a direct descendant, a brother, sister, husband or father, the tax will be only 73 rents in every $100 on the minimum' smout named, this tax In creases as the consanguinity diminish es, and in the case of a Ifsoy to strangers it s mounts to $5.00 In every $100. On the other kind there la a sliding scale, which Increases the tax atloa as the legacy Increases, so that In the rase of legacies of I30.non.uw) or over the tax would amount to one qnarter of tne bequest Itself. Pro vision for the coUectloa ef the (ax Is made through the bores a of Internal revenue. Ia the case of estates over $tOOO,000 la value, the execators are given three years, if desired, ia which to nettle the taxes. The deferred taxes win draw interest at the rata of per rent but the object of the delay Is to prevent sacrificing real estate or aecvrttlea by throwing a large s mount ImnedUtriy on the market The o.atioa of aa Urease tax has not yet been broached, bat It Is aaderstood that a bill to rale end will be Intro- dared a lit tie later la the session. 

BEAM) DJ PABSffifl. " The president's message ran so closely on Bryan lines that the '"Bryan-Roosevelt merger" quite capti vates such a critic as the New York World. If any one will study the mes sage in comparison with Bryan's Madison square speech there will ap pear a parellelksm astonishing to be hold, when It is considered that the two men are In opposing parties.- Springfield Republican. , Those who do their holiday buying early in December, and early In the day, will benefit themselves,, and be sides will have the gratification of knowing that tbey have made u lit tle easier the labor of the men, wo men and girls who do the selling, and of the men who drive the delivery wagons. By doing its shopping early in the mouth, the public will distrib ute the work that is usually crowded Into a few days over a longer period; and by doing it early iu the day, it will make late hours for the sales people unnecessary.

Washington Herald. i ; v.:. - The autocrat power asked for" by the president in his special message to congress, urging legislation that will give the executive authority, up otf his owu initiative and responsibil ity, to dismiss any officer whom he deems unworthy to . remain In the service, will" meet with bitter opposi tion In both branches of congress as It richly deserves. Hartford Post. ' .'"' By the English corrupt practices act the amount that any candidate may spend for his election to office is lim ited. A similar amendment to the act of the late general assembly is wprthy of consideration. With the general working of that act during the recent election George L. Fox is satisfied. It was, he says closely observed, with but few exceptions, throughout the state, and that In all probability there was no other state in the union which had a cleaner election record.

"Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of order," interrupted the Ghost, who had been sitting. In one of the rear seats; "the motion to adjourn Is not debatable." Confronted thus by Robert's Rules of Order, the Noble Dane paled, mut tered incoherently and sat down. Af terward he had his speech inserted in the Congressional Record.
