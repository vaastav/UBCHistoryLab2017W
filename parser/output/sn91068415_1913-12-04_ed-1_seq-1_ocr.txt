T WASHINGTON CITY MT VERNON. The editor with a number of High Point people, spent Tuesday and Wednesday in the Capital City, r Washington is an inter esting city at all times it matters not how many times you go there. We had the pleasure to be present when President Wil son read his now famous message to Con gress and to witness a record -breaking crowd to hear this distinguished democrat ex ecutive of the nation. The boy's corn club and the girl's cooking dub from Ohio, beaded by Governor Cox and two thousand strong swept down on Wash ington Wednesday and paraded the streets that night. Atrip to historic bid Mt. Vernon, the home of the Father, of our Country, is ever inter esting. The mansion situated on a high elevation overlooking the placid waters of the Potomac is one of the most picturesque places in America. The home is much larger than outward appearances indicate. When once inside you find eighteen rooms placarded and each article of furniture marked and having a glorious history. The assembly room show ing the beautiful and artistic fire place, trinkets of General and Martha Washington, the mammoth state platter, etc, Mrs Wash ington's living room, the writing table, maps, lounges, etc, in about the " same posiUon as left in 1801, the music box given by General Washington to Eleanor Custis upon her marriage to. Lee; LaFayette's rojm; the par lor with the art square,' a gift fro.n King Lpats XVI to Washington; Eleanor or "Nel lie" Custis' room with its beautiful old furni ture and massive bed canopy and little keep sakes; the bed room of General Washington showing the bed upon which he expired; the one window room in the attic directly over the General's of Mrs Washington, showing where she also died two years later; the Riv er Room; guests room, spare rooms, etc. In the hall on first floor hangs the sword in pos session of Washington when he left the army and used by him when he was inaugurated president with inscription taken from a codi cill in his last will: "Never unsheathe this sword except it be in defense of life or for tha nrntprHrin nf tha fmintrv .n,1 lut ro. miun in the possession of the user" in battle till death." The coach house contains the ' old coach of state with its massive draperies and greatly dished wheels and elongated ladder-steps. The old kitchen with the utensils Martha Washington was wont to pride her self upon; the sacred and hallowed spot the tomb of Washington, with the bodies of the General and Mrs. Washington in the vestibule and the sarcophagus in the back ground containing 30 bodies of the "official' Washington family together with two others on the side of Eleanor Custis Lee and hus band, making J4 altogether. The rema;ns of Washington were removed to this tom 32 years after his death and a glance inn) the ros wood casket at that time revealed the immortal Washington looking about the same the day he was buried. A large herd of deer is being raised on the estate.- .'v.. . ..;.v v..v.., Just now tha carpenters are putting a new roof on the house and the editor had the pleasure while there ot being presented with an old hand made nail extracted from the roof just over the rooms of General and Mar tha Washington. There were three altogeth er and the carpenter came down the ladder and turned them over to the keeper of the home who in turn was persuaded to part with one of them. Mt. Vernon as before stated is a most beautiful place and every one should visit it It will make them broader and bigger and better in every way. North Carolina is always represented in every nook and corner of this country and you invariably run across them. While there we met Mr - Thompson of Ashe counry who is thinking of locating near Washington on a fine farm. 

WASHINGTON SIDE LIGHTS Ev:ry citizen if possible should visit the Capital of his country at least once a year. For fifteen or twenty dollars one can come to Washington and spend two or three days; To see congress in sessionjook over theCapital,the congressional lib rary, the White House and the grounds, are worth this amount and more. Every day people are here from Maine to California. In one day the editor met farmers from Ohio, congressmen from California, cattlemen from Texas and Arizona, brokers from New York Citj , Indians from Oklahoma, natiyes of Alaska and delegates in Congress from the Phillipine Islands, all this empha sizing how cosmopolitan this nation is becoming. Whether you meet men from the Philippines, Alaska, Oklahoma, Texas, New York or elsewhere, all of them glory in the progress and spirit of the stars and stripes and the tendency of the country to demand our neighbors to be ruled by constitutional govern ment. When President Wilson said in his message the only shad, w of war was to -the south of us and hung over Mexico and that peace was not assured until Huerta be came deprived of his usurped pow ers, the galleries applauded vocifer ously and the farmer from Ohio joined the business man of New York and the manufactures of Mich igan in supporting this hoble senti ment x A day spent here looking over the magnificent government buildings and the capacious grounds ming ling with the hundreds that throng the hotels from all over the world will intensify one's patriotism and make him a bigger, more loyal and useful citizen. .

But the table was more than equal to the occasion and groaned under its load of good things to say nothing of the fullness of neath afterwards.
