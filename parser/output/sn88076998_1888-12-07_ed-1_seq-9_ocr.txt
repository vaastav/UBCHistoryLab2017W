THE I'liNSION 1.1ST. The number ot pensioners added to th'i list -(luring the fiscal year ended .June SO, IW is (iU.3."2, and increase of pensions as granted in 45.11ti cases. The names of 15,••)() pensioners were dropped from the rolls during the ear for various causes and. at the close of the j-ear, the number of persons of nil classes re ceiving pensions was 45'J..r.r)T. Of these there were suit survivors of the war of lbT-2. 1U.7KT •widows of those who served in that war. lli.MiO soldiers of the Mexican war, and O.llil widows of said soldiers.

ItKVISlO.N (If I'liNSION I.AWS. I am thoroughly convinced that, our general pension laws should be revised and adjusted to meet as ar as possible, in the light ot our ex perience, all menlorious cast's. The fact that 104 difterent rales of pensions are paid cannot, in my opinion, be made consistent with justice to the pensioners or to the government,and the numerous private pension bills that are passed predicated 111 on the imperfection ot general laws, while they increase 111 many cuses exist­ ing in quality and injustice lend additional force, to the recommendation for 11 re\lsiou of the general laws on this nubject. The laxity of ideas prevailing among a large number of our people regarding pensions is be coming every day more marked. The princi ples upon which they should be granted are in danger of being altogether ignored, and (I al ready pensions are olten claimed because the •applicants are as much entitled as other suc cessful applicants, rather than upon any disability reasonably attrib utable to military service. If the establishment of various precedents be continued: if the granting of pensions be not divorced from partisan and other unworthy and irrevelant considerations, and if the hon orable name of veteran unfairly becomes by these means but another term for one who constantly clamors for the aid of the govern ment, there is danger that Injury will be done to the fume and patriotism of many whom our citizens all delight to honor, and that a preju dice will be aroused unjust to meritorious ap plicants for pensions.

HOW IT WAS RECEIVED. The Message Ilns Not I.eft a Very 1'avora IIIH Impression. tjj»oclBl to the DISPATCH WASHINGTON, Dec. S.—At the conclusion of the reading of the president's message today the democrats heartily endorsed it, •while t-ho republicans could not iind any thing good to i.y in its behalf. A few of the expressions obtained are piven below .- Mr. Hoar—It embodies the utterances of a disappointed politician. Mr. Sherman—There is nothing striking about it. Mr. Cullom—Of necessity he dies game 011 his tariff views, and in his reference to internal affairs runs into a great scold. Mr. Krye—The only part of the communica Tfcfion which interested me was that referring to the fisheries question. I am now trying to solve the problem therein, namely: The pres. ident states that there has been nothing of moment occurring on that subject since March last. Why, then, does ho severely crit icize us for not passing retaliatory legisla tion? Mr. anderson—I was not particularly struck with what I heard of the message. If Mr. Cleveland will visit the Northwest, he will lini} that our farmers do not indorse his utterances on the tariff question. Mr. Cockrell—Generally speaking, it im pressed mo very favorably. Mr. Kansom—I think it was like all of Mr. Cleveland's public communications have been, a very able and concisely framed instrument. Mr. Teller—I think that the tirst part of the message is full of spleen. Mlnnen-talis In Washington. Bpccltl to lb# PtarAtcm. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—Minnesota was oretty well represented when congress met today. Congressman Nelson was in his seat early to renew the light against Uenger and his bridge bill. Wilson and Mice were on deck as calm as though nothing had happened. There were some good natu'red in quiries as to how it was that Minnesota did not drop into the democratic ranks, but they bore the chaffing manfully. They come loaded with new bills, which they expect to lire in as soon as opportunity oilers. —A young Lieutenant in a line regi ment recently met with a sad rebuff at Portsmouth.
