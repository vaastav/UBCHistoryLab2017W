GENERAL DISPUTES AR- Hoir Being Negotiated Between This Country and England an Event in History—Expected to Bo in Operation Before the Cloeo of This Administra tion WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.—The negotia tions between the United States and ««, Great Britain for a treaty of general few moments arbitration, covering all subjects of dif ference between the two English speaking nations, present and pros pective, has advanced to a stage of completeness far beyond what the pub lic has had reason to believe. The purpose of Secretary Olney and Sir Julian Pauncefote is to conclude nego tiations within the next three weeks. All of the substantial features of the treaty have been agreed on. From the present status of the negotiations, it is believed the following will be the im portant terms of the treaty: Feature* of the Treaty. NEW 

STORE! NEW GOODS! .v. ITOITOHE! FUEHITDRE! First—A term of five years from the date of the exchange of ratification within which the treaty shall be oper ative. Second—A court of arbitration of six members, three to be drawn from the judiciary of the United States and three from the judiciary of Great Britain. Third—The submission to this tri al of all differences between the two nations, or to arise within the |eriod of five years, this not to in ude the Bering sea question or the enezuela question, now before inde pendent commissions, but to include the question of the boundary between Document of Importance. The completion of this treaty will in ark an important epoch in the rela tions between the two English-speaking nations, and in the judgment of those who have been most identified with its consummation it will be the most im portant document of a peaceful char acter in the history of their mutual dealings. The president made passing allusion to the subject in his recent message. It has been understood, how ever, that the main purpose of Mr. AIaXJjAj* Olney was to reach an'agreement as to Venezuela, and that, having accom olished this, the larger question of Arbitrating All DlfTferenoea would require considerable time for its complete development. But the nego tiations have proceeded with surpris ing unanimity so that those engaged in the work confidently believe that it will be fully agreed upon and the sig natures of the contracting parties placed to the documents within three weeks. This will give fully two months for tho consideration and rati fication of the treaty at the present session of the United States senate, and unless some unexpected obstacle should arise in that quarter, there is every reason to anticipate that the treatv May lie Made Bflltctira before the close of the present adminis tration. At least this is the oonfident hope and expectation of those most con cerned in the negotiations. Aside from the previously referred to points, it can be stated in a general way that the terms of the treaty are such as to "clear the board" of all the vexatious questions which have arisen between the United States and Great Britain. These have been numerous in recent years, and some of them have threatened serious consequences. Advantage* of tho Treaty. The main purpose of the treaty is to guard against future differences threatening a rupture and in this the negotiators believe that the terms of the instrument will be such as to avoid all possibility of international conflict for the future. This is regarded as the main achievement. It is one said to be peculiarly advantageous to the com mercial interests of both countries, as suring them against rnmors of war or the serious prospect of war. The reasons for limiting the treaty to five yean are doubtless to place a of this extent v a i K
