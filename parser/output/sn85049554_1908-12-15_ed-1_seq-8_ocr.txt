Special to Times-Wcpublicun. GrinneJl, Dec. 15.—W. T. Fuller, who suffered an attack of pneumonia two or three weeks ago, has so far re covered as to be down town today for the lirst time since he was taken sick, lie is planning to take up work for the winter at least, in some warmer climate. The Baivtist church w.'i.s well filled Sunday afternoon by the Masonic lodge, and by many non-Masons, hear tho address ly Uev. ,T. Artliu Hurley, pastor of that church, on the subject, "Masonry What It Stands for." The address has received much commendation from those in a posi tion to know the scope and correct ness of the statements, and was well calculated to remove prejudice from the minds of those who may havi judged of the order without a knowl edge of its principles and practices. Mr. Thomas Kuller, of Chester, who has been an Invajiri for many years, has recently had added to his other phys ical ailments severe and continued at tacks of bleeding at the nose, at times so violent as to demand the skill of the physician to effect any cessation ol' the attack. At present writing, the trouble, is under control, but the re currence and violence of the attacks have left him in a weakened condi tion. Pursuant to the call Issued some time ago 'by tho chairman of the com mittee for the organization of the fanners, a goodly number gathered at the city hall on Saturday and selected John Evans, Jr., as president and T. S. Mason, of Grinnell towfishlp, as sec retary of the temporary organization for the discussion of ways and means for the development of a permanent or ganization for the best interests of the farming community. F. M. Card, presi dent of the Business Men's association of this city, stated the object of calling this meeting, and 'that the business men stand neady to co-operate in am way with ttfc farmers' institute. B. F. Abel, of G/ir.iiell, gave his experience in the short course at Marshall to w.i last year, and E. W. Armstrong, of Sugar Creek, gave his experience in the school at Ames, in both corn and stock judging. Both these men urged very earnestly the formation of an ac tive organization of the farmers, an 1 such a joining hands with the busi ness men's organization of Grinnell as shall bring the best possible "short course" here next year. Other speak ers were Jacob Korns and J. D. Boyack. By motion carried, a committee of live was appointed by the chair, to draft constitution and nominate officers for the permanent organization, to be pre sented at the*next meeting of the or ganization to be held In 'this city on •the 13th of January next, being the third day of the corn contest week The following committee was named: L. M. Smith, of Grinnell township E. W. Armstrong, of Sugar Creek Andrew Lincoln, of Washington town ship Ralph Sherman, of Chester, and B. F. Abel, of Grinnell. The hour of meeting on Saturday was an incon venient one for the farmers, but, whili not many were present, each one was ready to vouch for a number of his neighbors, and more than 100 have al ready signed the application for charter membership in tho organization. Mr. William Sanders and family plan to go this week to spend the re mainder of the winter with the num erous Sanders and Andrews relatives in California. Mrs. A. B. Goss, who some months ago sold her farm of 105 acres a mils south of this city, to Mr. Lidtka, has •bought the residence property known as the Zimmerman place, on South West street and will take possession about the middle of February. Noah and IJtley'plan to move their plumbing stock from their .present lo cation in the Proctor building into the Ames ib.lock, in order to have more room, as soon as Carroll Brothers have completely vacated the room by mov ing their stock to the Salvation Army barracks. Mrs. H. t. Works starts today for Riverside, Cal., where she plans to spend 'the winter and spring at tho home of Mr. Henderson Herrick, one of the early settlers-of this city. The Mrs. Robinson residence prop erty, recently sold at auction at the Dr.- Pippin sale, 'has again changed hands, and become the property of William V. Davies, the consideration being $1,:!00. Mr. Alfred Breiting, who has been having hospital care and treatment in this city for typhoid symptoms, has re turned to his home in Malcom very much improved in health. Rev. J. Arthur Hurley was recently called to his former parish at Carth age, 111., to conduct the funeral serv ices over the remains of a former par ishioner. The working team of the Knights of Pythias lodge of this city are to ibe the guests o-f their Pythian brethren a: New Sharon tomorrow evening, and exemplify for them the working of the rank of sir knight.

Miss Alice Doe, who spent the summer in Denver fort the benefit of Miss Doe's health, and came to urinneli uut a low weeks ago, find the changes of cli mate not beneficial, and will return to Denver on Thursday of this week. The Society of Grinnell Boosters have decided that, to herald the good news and to attract the attention of the public generally, and stimulate others to help or to heln more, the whistles of the manufactories and the waterworks, will blow simultaneously, at the odd hours ot the day, for every thousand dollars added to the amount given to the endowment fund by the citizens and neai: neighbors of Grin nell. These sums will not have to come in gifts of an even $1,0(1-0 each, but when smaller gifts aggregate $1, 000. the welcome sound iwill be heard. The friends of A. B. DeHaan, of Iowa Colleire.

RENEWED ACTIVITY IN HOGS This Was Principally Due to Fact That Receipts Were 6,000 Less Than a Week Ago—Big Packers Hold Off Till Late Little Doing in Sheep Market. Chicago, Deo. 15.—Cattle receipts were light, and offerings ran largely to butcher stuff and common steers. Prices were steady, and trado was (iuiet. Hogs. There was renewed activity, at steady values, principally because to day's run was fi.000 less than last Tuesday. Scalpers and .shippers were free buyers early, big packers holding off until late. If hog growers In the country are desirous of aiding packers in -their bear campaign they have only to keep the market lnxpper tilled. With 230,000 hogs at Chicago .last week imckcrs .were only able to effect a depreciation of 25 cents per 100. On Saturday Armour put up a drove of mixed at $5.50, which Is 50 cents per 100 above the Armour and Cudahy forecast. Whether or not that half dollar is to 1m_ taken off dejfeuds on the grower. This week will furnish a test, as the Pittsburg and Buffalo markets will again 'be In operation, af fording oa-steiYi shippers an oppor tunity to buy at least a portion of their droves nearer home. Growers must now sell on a H-cent country basis and !t remains to be seen whether they are in tho humor to do that or not. Whllo not as ravenous for hogs as a few weeks ago packers nevertheless display a willingness to buy them whenever even a slight concession is made and the big supply last week was well eleaned up.

Habitual colds are due to an ill kept bkin on the outside and dyspeptic mucous inent brane'on the inside, the result of indigestion, coupled with carelessness. Cold water, proper food and common sense are the foundations upon which a preventive must rest. A cold sponge bath, one to three minutes long be fore breakfast, with a brisk dry Tub, is ex cellent—usually all that is necessary to keep the cutaneous circulation alive and the skin reactive to 6udden changes of temperature. For those unaccustomed to cold water, tol errthco can be gained in three weeks' time by the use of water at any comfortable temper ature, making it one degree colder each day, until it can be employed without dread as colli as it will run. Sea Bait may be added to the water for its stimulating eflect. Cold water intelligently used does not steal vitality, but fosters it. It stimulates the nerves that control the expansion and con traction of the blood vessels and regulates tho cutaneous circulation. One should "keep moving" when wet or chilly and not 6tand on a street corner or elsewhere without taking deep breath. The lungs used in this way act as a pump to drive the blood along.

Will Go* to Extremes. It is now very well understood by the leaders of congressional indigna tion. that the president is in a frame of mind to go to extremes if necessary in order to "make good," with his charges of improper motives for placing limi tations on the employment of the secret service. 'Mr. Roosevelt is a genius for the art of being prepared. It is one of his maxims that the way to avoid war is to be ready for It. That maxim he ap plies quite as rigorously to political conflict a? to physical and interna tional. He is the possessor of a mar velous magazine of weapons and am munition adapted to the contest which congress has been threatening. That he is determined to employ them to tho very limit, if the issue be forced upon him, is now accepted as beyond con jecture. "Prepared?" echoed one of the pres ident's advisors when asked if tho White House were ready for the fray: "Well, I should say so. Haven't you no ticed that we always are prepared?" It is understood on excellent author ity that the president is especially In dignant against certain members of the house appropriations committee who took an active part in the legislature to cripple the secret service, at the last .session. He is said to have a fine ar ray of material with which to enliven the situation if the issue is pressed: and he is so anxious for the showing •McBride & Will Drug of strength that he is not disposed to ret,ulre more than a very delicate slap on the wrist in order to Induce him to jump into the center of the arena with the big stick in hand, and to lay about him with even more than accustomed vigor. Will Play Ducks and Drakes. Tt is predicted that if the chief exec utive is invited into the ring he will play ducks and drakes with a choice collection of political reputations. For seven years he has been watching de velopments in connection with the In nermost relations and influences that are influential with men in public life. He has a fine card index array of in- formation which will make the most sensational kind of reading if it is ever !Leml.er transmitted in the form of a message. The president doesn care tiro snap of his finger for any such mild-man nered action as the expunging of a paragraph or a message. He knows that the thing expunged will, by that act, he 'brought to tho attention of the country as nothing else would bring it. He doesn't feel any concern about specific charges, made in a public way, being expunged from -the public's rec ollection. Ho has been struggling with congress for years in the effort to wrest its leadership into a respectful atten- tion to his demands. He is rather anx- old, powerful railroad politician in his district. Nobody else excer that rail road manager could have been much concerned. The public's interest plain ly enough lay on one side the rail road's on the other. The congressman voted with the railroad interest. The president, let it be assumed—and it can be assumed as to some cases—has 1 j'.. i-. •. •'•..• ..-.•••.
