Tutni lave been lew Presidential raesUira ill recent years wbicb were expected ,0 ileal with commonplace allium, which ivre anticipated with an much intercut as L',,' initial message ol 1'reaident Arthur, 1 rt?l in Congress yesterday, and printed in 1 lull in our telegraphic columns this morn- ' itj. The reference therein to tho death ol 1 the lale President (iarlleld is brief, but ' fill impress, the country as being fitly ' Kile, and all the formal allusion to the ' mournful event which so recently wrapped ' tie laud in gloom, that waa desirable in 1 this document. The cordial friendly rehtiuus between our Government and other powers, which the President announces, ' in matters for sincere gratification, and r tlio recent expressions ol friendly " sympathy in our affliction have doue much 1 to cement these relations. The only direc- ' t.un in which a cloud mars tho bright sky f of universal peace is in South America, and '. the stepstaken by our own Government towrithe restoration of peaco there will 1 meet with hearty concurrence all over the r country. The reference in the message to 11 the uHairs of the other powers in this hem- c iipbere will he perused with much interest. The recommendations of the different b heaiis of departments which are seconded Q by the President will no doubt receive that r wly and weighty consideration which 1 their importance demands. The entire " me?wgJ is one which furnishes much P reason for gratification and pride on the tl part of all citizens who have the country's I peace and advancement in the march of a civilization, and tho material and moral welfare of the people at heart, and much C also that calls for grave thought, not on the ^ part of Congiess alono, but the country at F laiye as w?'ll. ci , li The session of tho Ohio Legislature y, which commences on Monday, January 2, g in expected to be fraught with considerable interest, and to result in uction of much importance to the Suite politically as well f; an materially. The most important subject ci claiming the attention of the body will be y the rearrangement of the counties of the $ State into Congressional districts. Tho t< character of the changes made will depend y entirely upon the uction of Congress in ap- a portioning representatives to the various g States; but whether tho representation I> allotted to Ohio remains ns now, twenty in number, or is increased, some alterations will be necessary owing to tho shifting of I1 population sincere last census. There is (: a desire on the prn ot the Republican ma* & jority to combino Franklin county, in k u-liii-l, P.iliinihiia la atlnntail with nthnr 1. territory so on to form a district which will d electji Republican in place of Mr. Converse, t ind there iHalso a probability that Cuyahoga h rounty (Cleveland), will demand attention S on account of its increase of population. A 8 project iii being discussed over there to b divide the county, combining the euHtern and larger suction with Luke county and tl e ( wistrrn with the contiguous territory. But be th?? changes what they may, the Republican majority in both houses is so large c that they will be able to control any action a taken. It. is feared by some conservative g members of the party that their majority is (. too large?that the preponderence of He- fl publicans may lead to party action which J, would not be wise from either a partisan or s i disinterested standpoint; but these fears c are no doubt groundless, the Republican members being of too high an order of intelligence and integrity to hike any mean J or short sighted advantage of the situation. Among the important subjects concerning t which legislation will probably be sought, '1 uthc matter of transportation on railroads, j It is predicted by those who claim ( to know, that the railroad war will f be carried into the Ohio Assembly, and j attempts made to influence legislation in l, Uvor of the various factions; but Ohio Is f certainly not a favorable State to wage such f i war in, when her orgunic law on the sub- f ject is considered. But, at any rate, enough , interest centres in the approaching session of her law makers to make the probable outcome a matter of speculation and warm y discussion by our over-the-river exchanges, ( from this time forward.

At Judge French's solicitaiion, Secretary Folger will give an audience ;o the iron men himself, as the Assistant Secretary nays,he has heard ahd reheard the natters to be brought forward until he hinks his decisions and views upon the luhject are pretty weH known.

MO,502,537, which is over $-18,000,000 in- i reaso over the estimates for the current t ear, and for which Congress appropriated ^ 315,535,000. The probability is that the M )tal appropriation for the next fiscal year j rill be nearly $.180,000,000. This includes h pension deficiency of $20,000,000, an ' mount culled for by the Commissioner of 1 'elisions to settle pension arrears. 1 OOIXO TO FIOIIT FOR RIDDLED EROER. u Senator Mahone, Collector Brady, and | 'ostmaster Van Aiken, of Petersburg; [ ienerul James Williams, of Winchester; t Ir.

Some disappointment is expressed n some quarters that he did not more disinetlv and definitely enunciate a policy, "his feeling, however, seems to bcconflned o those who hope for the domination of a 1 notion of the party. The Uepublicansgenerlly think the President means to ignore | actions and to heal dissensions, tmd are (lad he refrained from sayinganythingthat i lould be seized upon by either faction. iVestern Republicans, especially those roin silver producing Suites, "are not 1 (leased at the recommendation to limit > illver coinage, but they console themselves vith the belief that Congress will not carry > >ut that recommendation. :i(B NEW

It can be deiln tely and-authoritatively tated that Secretary Hunt will retain his , Cabinet position, and James will remain as lead of the Postofflce Department until he end of the present fiscal year. James, vhen questioned to-night,admitted that he , sto remain until the end of next June; ( ind Lincoln also admits that he will re- , nain. It is reported to-night that Kirk- | vood has also been informed by the Presi- , lent that he desires him to remain.

Washhjoton, December G.?Upon the jpeningof the court this morning Oulfenu innounced that he had prepared an order for the attendance of witnesses. He suggested Saturday, and would desire tlio ;ourt to sign at once. The order was handed fudge Co*. Seoville called George C. Oorhnm, editor of the Republican, but he did not res|w>nd. Charles B Karwell, member of Congress from Chicago, took the stand snd was questioned upon the state of feeling between the factions of the Republican party just previous to the shooting of President (.iarReld. Judge Porter objected to tnklng tip the time of the court by this kind of evidence. Witness wns questioned as to his firqnaintance with the prisoner, "Ottliean hud called Upon him (witness) at his office in Chicago, and showing him some newspaper slips, MUd that ht was nbout to pur chase the Inter-Ocean, and toUl witness that if he would luun him $100,000 he would make him (witness) President of the United States." Guiteau, (emphatically)?That is false. I never made any sueh proposition. I asked him to invest home money in the enterprise, hut he said he had already put $10,000 into the Inter'Ckean and wuuld uot put in any more. Witness again saw tho prisoner in this city in March last. The prisoner had a recommendation for the Paris Consulship and wanted witness to sign it. The witness never thought the prisoner a sane man. Upon cross examination the witness was asked if, in the conversation mentioned, he had any opportunity to form an opiuion as to whether the prisoner was able to distinguish between right and wrong. Scoville objected to the question, and argued at great length in support of his objection. Guiteau continually broke in and insisted that the question had no bearing on the case; that his mind all through was blank on the question of right and wrong; that he ; wa/ impelled by inspiration, which he j could not resist. Judge Cox ruled that the question could be entertained, and it was again put. The witness thought there were grades of insanity, and did not think the prisoner ho insane but that he could distinguish between right and wrong. Scoville desired to note exceptions. Guiteau again broke in excited I v: "I want this ' understood right here; it will put a stop to nil this irrelevant nousense?I acted from ' inspiration." 1 Judge Cox.?Well, that will do, prisoner. ' You have said that a great many times, and ! you must not interrupt the Court again. (iorham took the stand and a discuslion then endued between the counsel upon the form of the questicyis, in which 1 iuiteau insisted upon Uikiiur part, rurning to Scoville ho said: "You are jetting a little cranked, yourself, on thin < lubject 1 won't have your lin?* of defense. \ It's altogether too nftrrow." (iorhuinwus I old to step down, when (luiteau shouted i )itt, "Come back, ( iorham, I want to a*k t i'ou u few questions. I want you to j, itate whether you didn't write ant) publish n hist April, May and June," a great uuny s rvry bitter articles denouncing President j iarfield for wrecking the Republican I larty?" t (.iorhaui acknowledged that he did. t - c l> IVI l> l> I VIM I Define* IIin nitil IJIvp* III* Wliyn 1 null M iKjrelore*. r Washington, December 0.?In the Sen- J ite 'to-day, when Senator Edmunds called i ip his resolution providing for the contin* u lance of tiie committees as they existed at <1 he last session, President pro tern. Davis, vho temporarily occupied his former seat in tho floor, haviug vacated the chair to j' Senator Harris, said. Mr. President: 0 The solemn event which excited the sym- ti >athy of the civilized world recently, has [' irought about an unexpected change in he Presidency. The Forty-seventh Con;ress now meets under tho constitutional r accessor to the President who was only naugu rated last March, and who was itrickfii down in the maturity of his man* f. iood, after but four short months experi- n ;iice in the Executive chair. n These stern facts are full of admonition, q fhey teach us how frail are huiiiau hope*, v ind how transitory is human power. In the p iresence of sail instruction, ambition t nay well pause, uud all of u.i may well c earn how vain are the aspirations to which a oo much of ourdives is devoted. Great ns was the bereavement which ipread sorrow over the land and which ouched the heart of every fireside it was t lanctiHcd by the consolation that the peo- g >le of all sections were brought nearer t ogether by common grief, and thin * sumo to the understanding each other I tetter throtign kindred emotions. me i isperitics that had long established i hem were softened and violence of faction i vas chastened by affliction. r Although President Arthur represent* \ he party that elected General Garfield, r ?is personal position is necessarily delieate md trying. Me is entitled, by his whole p jearing through this critical ordeal, the c renerous countenance of Senatprs. I pro- i me to extend to his administration van- t lid treatment, sustaining it when right and ? jppo.-ing it when wrong, on all public < piestions. Holding to this purpose and in- i lending to insist on a pare, economical f ml? just ad minis'rat ion of the executive ( rust, the new President ought to bo aided t l>y all proper legislative co operation in i carrying out the general policy he mav ? propose to the country whatever that policy in future may be, he is entitled to a fair trial and patient hearing. With this view of my duty I almll vote willingly to continue the commitees in this body ism they are now constituted. It is best that the party which has the President nnd House of Representatives should be held answerable for all public measures, then there will be no divided responsi- . bility. If the opposition are wise thev will : accept this conclusion. At the special session in March they ' made but a brief and feeble stand against 1 the organization of the committees which j diape the great legislation of the country. , Indeed, they almost conceded that import- , unt point to their adversaries. But in the protracted contest for officers of the .Senate, ( under the same political conditions, tnv Democratic friends yielded no ground from ' the beginning to the end of it. Doubtless they had satisfactory reasons for thiscourae of policy. ? I Last spring I took occasion to state the I reasons why my vote should be given for < the then existing organization of the Sen- i ute, although the circumstances have ma- I terially changed since that time. The ob- t ligation which I voluntarily assumed bus * not been altered, hence I adhere to that ( declaration alwavs, reserving to myself the right of rejecting offensive candidates. 1 I am greatly encouraged in this de- f fttsfon bv the course of my dis- r linguisheu friend from Vermont ? em- f Inent as a leader of his party, as he Is also I minent for public ami private worth. Up- ! m his motion the present chief clerk, dis- 1 linetly appointed as a Democrat, was unan- I imnti?lv made netinft Secretary. That m graceful (teed la a efieering sign which 1 it affords mo pleasure to applaud < publicly, because this Is the first place j where an exntniile should he set against f common scrambling for office that (Ik figuresour political life. The country wm i I most evenly divided between the two ' urent parties at the Presidential election. ! The ninjoritv in the House of Representatives in Rtimll nn*l in this chamber the ! Republicans and Democrats cannot route each other with like numbers. The com* J tnlttecs ar?? now held by onn partv and the ' offices of the Senate are held bv the other party. From mv standpoint It would be unwise to disturb this condition of things, ! nnd I do not propone to engage in any struggle looking that object. ' j As our polities are organised, the public man who sleeps outside of the pnrtv bin's is always exjwtsed to, harsh criticism, no matter how proper his motives may he. Machinery enforem rigid discipline'and i tlei ounces revolt as treason. For tin' last ten years my political t>o?i- i tion bus been entirely independent of any org:?nifiition. I have accepted 'the gon.'l wherever it wns found, and I have voted for the best men whether they wore called : R"nublieans or Democrats. Thediiy is drawing near when I shall retire from' this chamber. My only nmhition while here is to be instrumental in bringing about perfect neaco between the North and Mouth as the nest means of promntlng a permanent prosperity to the whole Union. ' HJUHbca HIS

RELATIONS WITH THE MOTHER COUNTRY. j The feeling of good will between our i >wn Government and that of Great Britain I vas never more marked than at nr? sent, t [ n recognition of this jilensing fact, I direct- c k1, on the occasion of the late Centennial i celebration at Yorktown, that a salute be v fiven to the llriiish flag. ii Save for the corn si>ondenco to which I n thai I refer hereafter in relation to the pro- t tosed eunal uero^s the Isthmus of Panama, v ittle has occurred worthy of mention in l ho diplomatic relation of the two cnunries. Early in the year the Fortune Bay laims were witisfactorily settled by the j( iricinh Government paying in full the sum 0 if jEI">0,00(), the most of which has been id- t| eady distributed. As to the terms of the L. ettleiUMnt included compensation for the ,j njuries sulFered by our fishermen at Aspee t| lay, .there him been retained from the ? xo*s awards a sum which is deemed ude- |, [iiatu for those claims. \ MKLnoi'KXK AND SIDNEY EXPOSITIONS. u The participation of Americans in the I' xhibitfons at Melbourne and Sidney will ' >e approvingly mentioned in the reports y i the two exhibitions soon to bo presented 11 r> C'ongniw.

You will be urnislied with the proceeding of the binetallic conference held during the sum- I ner at the city of Paris. No accord wus ' cached, hut a valuable interchange of " lews was had, and the conference will ! icxt year be renewed. At the Electrical exhibition, and Con- v :resx, also, held at Paris, this country wax * reditably represented by eminent special- ' sts, who, in the absence of an appropria- 1 ion, generously lent their efrort ut the in- * tance of the State Department. While I: iur exhibitors, in this almost distinctively (< American field of achievement have won | cveral valuable awards, I recommend that > Congress provide for the reimbursement of 11 he personal expenses incurred in the public * nterest by tiie honorary commissions K ind delegates. AMICADLB RELATIONS WITH GERMANY. No new nutations respecting the status of t mr naturalized citizens in Germany have | irisen during the year, and causes of com* r ilaint, especially in Alsace and Lorraine, n lave practically ceased through the Liber- t d action of the Imperial Government in n iccepting our often expressed views on the r mbject The application of the treaty of 18<W to the lately acquired Rhenish prov- t nces has received very earnest attention, r A definite and lasting agreement on this t point is confidently expected. \ The participation of the descendants of n Baron Von Steuben in the Yorktown fes- u ivitics, and the subsequent reception by jieir American kinsmen, strikingly evidences the tics of good will which unite lie German people and our own. ' IPANISI1 CLAIMS COMMISSION?UAROSnira TO } AMERICAN SHIPPING. j Our intercourse with Spain has been ( riendly. An agreement, concluded in [ February last, fixes a term for the Inborn r )f the Spanish and American Claims Com- ( nission. The Spanish Government has ? ieen requested to pav the late awards of hat Commission, and will, it is believed, n iccede to the request as promptly and t lourteouslvas on former occasions. t By recent legislation enormous fines have jeen imposed upon American shipping in A Spanish and Colonial ports, for slight ir egulnrities in manifests. One case of hardihTp is especially worthy attention. The c >ark "Masonia,' bonnd lor Japan, entered t| Manilla in distress, and is there sought to H >e conlocated under the Spanish revenue ? aws, for an alhged shortage in hertmns- ? hipped cargo.

Several such person through the co-operation of the Couiuii tioners of Emigration at New York, hai been sent back by the steamers whii brought them. A continuance of th :ourae may prove a mure effectual remed than diplomatic remonstrances.

About $00,000,000 of them are now 141 outstanding. They form an unnecessary addition to the paper currency, a sufficient " iimountof which mtiy be readily supplied by tho National bank*. U In accordance with the act of February ?u 28, 1878, the Treasury Department bus monthly caused at least two millions in Ul value ot silver bullion to be coined into standard silver dollars. One hundred and ai two millions of these dollars have been P1 already coined, while about thirty-four w millions are in circulation for reasons |f which ho specifies. 1 concur in tin* Sec- bt retury's recommendation that the provision cc for the coinage of a fixed amount each re month be repealed, and that hereafter only 111 10 much bo coined as shall bo necessary tr to supply the demand.

HKJi'UNOlNG MK.ISUKKS. In Che last annual report of the Secretary >f the Treasury the attention of Congrvu vus called to the fact that $4<tt),G5l,050 in ive per cent bonds and $203,57tf4750 in six >er cent bonds would become redeemable luring the year, and Congress was asked o authorize the refunding of these bonds it a lower rate of interest. The bill for iuch refunding having failed to become ? aw, the Secretary of the Treasury in an ippeal at last notified the holders of $195,>90,400 in six per cent bonds, then outfunding, that the bonds would be paid at ar on the first day of July, following, or hut they might be "continued" at tho t'eaaire of the Government, to bear inter*t ai the rate of 3} per cent per annum.

TAX RBDl'CTloy. It is a matter for congr.uulation that the i nines* ofthe country mu been ho prosper1.1 during the pa.it year aa to yield by tax* ion a large surplu.i of income to the Gov nment. If the revenue laws remain unuinged this surplus must year by year crease, on account of the reduction of the | jblic debt and the burden of interest, and ; . cause of the rapid inorease of our popu- ij tion. In 1800, just prior to the iiistitujn of our National revenue HyHtcm, our filiation but slightly exceeded 1)0,000,000. 4 y the census of 1880 it is now found to cceed 50,000,000, It is estimated that ren if the annual receipts and expend!res should continue as at present tho itire debt could be paid in ten years. In ew, however, of the heavy luad of taxa- J on which our people hove already borne, J e may well consider whether it is not tho 1 irt of wisdom to reduce the revenues, j ren if we deluy a little the inaymentof the ibt. It seems to me that the lime has arrived J hen the people may justly demand some re- i] effrom their present onerous burden, and | / due economy iu the various branches rfl the public service this inay ruadily bo -j forced. 1 therefore concur with the Sec- ' ] tary in recommending tho abolition of 1 internal revenue taxes except those 'i pon tobacco in its various forms and upon 1 wtilled spirits and fermented liquors; Vj id except, also, the special tux upon the ,<j lanufacturers of and dealers in such -j tides, Tho retention of the latter tax is fl esirablo as airording the officers of the j over nment a proper supervision of these A tides for the prevention of fraud. I agree with the Secretary of tho TreaS- i ry that the law imposing tustamp tax on r] imcues, nropriewry arncieH, niaying YH irds, cheeks and drafts, may, with pro- 4 riety, be repealed, and the law also by | hicn banks and bunkers are assessed upon J icir capital and deposits. There seems to j i a general sentiment in favor of this a wrse. In the present condition of our s venues the tux on deposits is especially & njust. It was never imposed in this coun- / y until it was deinandt d by the necemi- j iss of the war, and was never exacted, I '} jlieve, In any other country, even In ita eutest exigencies. Hankers are re- y. lired to secure their circulation ' # v pledging with the Treasurer of j 10 United States, bonds of the general ; overntnent the interest upon these bonds Inch, at the time when the tax was im- ; Med, whs six tier cent. It is now, in V ost instances, 3J per cent Besides, the ; itiru circulation was originally limited by',.? w, and no increase was allowable* When e existing*bunks had practically a ino- ' )poly of the business there was force in \ e suggestion that for the franchise to the t vored grantees, the Government might \ ;ry properly exact a tax on circulation, j it for j ears the system has been free, and : e amount of circulation regulated by the "i iblic demand. The retention of this ta* ) is been suggested hs a moms of re-imirsing the Government for the expense of inting and furnishing the circulating ites. If the tax should bo repealed it ptlld certainly seem proper to require the itloim! banks to pay the amount of such :nense to the Comptroller of the currency, j it is perhaps doubtful wliether the im- i ediate reduction of the rate of tux levied j ton liquor* and tobacco is advisable, esH'ially in view of the drain upon the *7 easurv which must attend the payment arrears of pensions.
