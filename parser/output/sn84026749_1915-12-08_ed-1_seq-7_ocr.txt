TOBK. Dec 8. On the eve of the leaving of a score of pacificists who are to 'join Henry Ford and the others of his peace jparty in Sweden announcement was made at the Ford headauarters In the Blltmoro Hotel that a message had been received by wire less from Mr. Ford. Excitement prevailed among' those present, hut It soon was subdued when they heard this message read; "All welL" - . Apparently 'there., was, some anxiety, aooara tne uscar u aoou; passports, tor U wireless rmessasawas received' from Qov.t L. B. Hanna, ot North Dakota, a member of the party, asserting that lie U urging Robert Lansing, Secretary of State, to Issue passports which will en'ablo members' ot the party to go to belligerent countries. The second contingent It was planned would leave today at 2 o'clock aboard the Fredcrik "VIII. of the Scandinavian American line.

Van Galder, of. .Reck Island, 111., and. others. George F. Milton, who describes him self as a Journalist and magazine writer, who was a delegate to the Democratic national conventions of 1900, 100. and 1912. issued a statement con demning preparedness for national de fense last night. He Is to be a passenger f the FrederlkVIH. "It is a pitiable commentary on the decline of American Idealism." he said "that Hennr Ford's movement Is rid iculed and condemned by the Eastern Dress. Better that ho should send an argosy In a perhaps premature move ment for peace than that he should use his great .industrial enterprises to make millions out .of human slaughter, as he nobly refused to do. A man who enlists the sympathy of Edisons, Bumbanks, Burroughs and Akeds cannot be laughed out of court." Ford's Wireless Call For Congress Support To WaitUntil Friday Henry Ford, aboard the "peace ship" Oscar II, has sent a wireless message to Congress asking support and en couragement on his mission to Europe. The Co cress Is asked to aid Ford and his associates "to deliver the men from the trenches and the women from their suffering and agonies." Mr. Ford; wireless message came to the office of Speaker Clark" last night Tliere Is no session of the House today, and. the petition must await the recon vening of the House next Friday for In sertion In the Congressional Record, and reference to some committee. As a rule petitions are merely recorded In the Congressional Record, and go Into thu archives of some committee. : It Is seldom that a petition Is read in the iJIousa or Senate, although any member may make a request that this he dortt. Although It came by wire less, Mr. Ford's petition Is likely to talco Its place with hundreds of others, on every conceivable subject, in the pjgeon-holes of the Congressional com mittee to which it Is referred. Mr.' Fprd's message, which was ad dressed' to ."The Congress of the United States;" reads; "We, cltlsens of the United States; now sailing tovEurope on the steamship Oscar It,, with the serious purpose of uniting with cltlsens of European neu tral countries In an organised effort to deliver the men from the trenches and the women from their suffering and agonies,, and restore the peace of the world upon an honorable and just basis which, will stop the mad race of com petitive armament, do- hereby earnestly petition and entreat you to give the peace mission your support and en couragement so that It may succeed at the earliest possible moment.

In a statement Issued upon reading the President's message of yes terday, took issue with the Cfatet. Ex ecutive's stand, upon very point men tioned. With tho exception 0'"" at tack upon hyphenated Americans. Even there, he said, the remedy lay in the hands of the Pr"ldent. JJgJ has "met a policy Of blood and Iron with a policy of milk ahd The Preeldcnt. he said, ts In olocu tion "& Byzantine logothete-ond By santlne logothetes were not men of fto. lion. Mr. -Wilson's actions aro in flat contradiction." he said. "A policy of dishonorable .inaction" Is his sweeping Indictment of tho President's course. The statement says In part: "At 'the outset President Wilson, sneaking of tho war, says 'Vrohavo sfood apart, studiously neutral. It was our manifest duty to do .so.' Further on ho soys: 'We Ins st .upon security in prosecuting our self-chosen lines of national development. Wo do more than that Wo demand it also for others.' Iater he says; -Wo regard war as a moans of assei-Urig the rtgilts M o. flnVes. 'Wo Aft JfcMehr jealous V of aggression from without, .' What does Alf. Wilson mean when in one line ho says !that we have stood apart, studiously, neutral' be cause 'It -was our- manifest duty to do so.' and a couple of paragraphs later aRUUIBi RKisj;niyi . ia.., .; j Tmpiitfn- -their Belf-ohosen lines of national development for others? Ho can take either of the two positions, hut hn ennirnt tnttn both. Did or did not Mr. Wilson 'demand security for Belgium to 'prosecute' its aeii-cnosen lines of national aeveionrornif no knows he did not. 1 Then -what,, apes i moitn hv snvintr that 'we demand this security also fof otherst" Again, he says that "he regards war as a means Of assertlmc the rights of a people against aggression,' and yet he says that.-.lt yvas otjr duty to re main Biuaioupjy ieuirai -vrncp tt- glum asserted the rights of her peo ple by war against the aggression of Germany. "Dishonorable Inaction." "How doos he reconcile- these .two statements Ho cannot do so. He is using words' to coyer a policy of dis honorable Inaction. Again, he says that we aro 'fiercely. Jealous of ag gression from without' How did ho show his 'fierce jealousy as regards the aggressions on the Lusltanla and Ancono, which resulted In thevloss of several scores and the jeopardy of hundreds of -American lives'? How has he shown his 'fierce jealousy' as regards the sixty or: seventy soldiers wearing the .American uniform, not to speaic or tne women, and children and, civilians, killed or wounded, on Amer ican soil br Mexican t bullets? -rnh symptom of his 'fierce jealousy" to! prevrnt. aggression - rrom without'" was the Issuing ;of an ordor that diir men should not fire back when fired upon,. Does Mr. Wilson regard that order ps 'florce Jealousy?' It does not strike any other human being as" such. "Pitiless Publicity." ''Three years ago Mr. Wilson said he believed in the poltcy of 'pitiless publicity.' We have never had as Se cretive an AdmljilstraUon. The exact numbers of the soldiers of the United states army who have been killed or wounded by Mexicans cannot hr told, because Mr. Wilson won't permit the figures to be made public. Neither Is It possible to ascertain the exact num bers of the American men, women and children who have been killed or out raged In person or property In Mexico, because Mr. Wilson for three years has hindered all publicity, pitiless or pitiful, about these outrages in Mexico. Mr. Wilson's elocuUon and Mr. Wilson's ac tion are In flat contradiction. His elocu tion Is that of a Byzantine Logothete and Byzantlnq tiogothetes were not men of action.' ' "President Wilson says that we have been put to the test In the case of Mex ico and have 'stood the. test; and. that we have1 applied a 'herolo ', principle to the case of Mexico.' Of all posslble ad jectives that! coul'd be found In ;the -English language by the most minute search on the part of the most subtle dtalec tlcan It would not be possible to find One more inappropriate to the Adminis tration's' course In Mexico than tha ad jective 'heroic. Nearly three years ago Mr. Wilson refused to recognlre Huerta on the ground that we were never 'to recognize a government founded on violence. Ho then tentatively supported Villa, who reoresented the embodiment of violence: It being meanwhile, assert ed on behalf of the Administration that under no circumstances would ire deal with Carranza, whose government like wise was, founded on violence. Says Wilson "Eats Own Words., "The Presldont, has now eaten his words and recognized Carranza; and through his private secretary he has issued a defense of and apology for the outrages committed by the Car- ranzlstas and'oy-the other bandits of tpe other .factions in Mexico, outrages as. Infamous as ever were committed HBJvaKe?. anywhere under the sun. "Mr. Wilson refused to employ the power of the United States to protect the lives of American men and the honor of American women or to save those wearing the United States uniform from death or from insult. Ho -took no steps to, save Mexican and foreign women, Including nuns, married women and unmarried women, when they wero subjected to Outrages and infamies which make the white slave traffic seem trivial by comparison. But he now uses the power of the United States to help one set of the bandits responsible for these infamies against another set. "In his present message President Wilson advocates as necessary certain propositions for putting this country in a state of preparedness to defend itself against foreign aggression. In his mes sage one year 'ago he said such propo sitions were, hysterical and improper. I am glad that he nas changed his mind, hut 1 am sorry that he has not taken tho. trouble to study the subject so as to make his proposals reasonably ade quate to the country's need. His pro posed enlargement of the regular army is utterly Inadequate. "The proposed, 'continental amry can not produce good results. It is a pro posal that lew of the young men or iho country shall for two months every year abandon their work and in the In terest of the common defense train them sclveji to. defend their successful huai nosa rivals who decllno to abandon their wtrk in the Interest of the com. mop flctense. "This is not a square deal. It Is not In accordance with the democratic ideal. The President's proposal is merely to create ah lnortlclent rival of the National Guard, It will dam age the National Guard without achiev ing any useful purpose whatever, "it iu the duty or this nation in time of peace to prepare for war; and it Is no less the duty of this Administration now in time of war to prepare tor the industrial struggles that will follow, upon pesce.
