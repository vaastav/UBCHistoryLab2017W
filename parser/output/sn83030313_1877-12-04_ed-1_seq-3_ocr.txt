The First Fruits ol the Ad mission of Kellogg. ? ? FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. Washington, Dee. 3, 1877. k CHECK TO TBE ANTI-BATES MEX?THE I COCBTEST OT THB SENATE ABROGATED. In tbe executive session this morning the antl- I Hay** nion lonnd themselves cbeclced and eventu- ' ally defeated,' and the defeat was of such a i Kind as show* that tbe President will dnd no difficulty in baring all bla nominations confirmed. Tbo nomination of Smith to b? Collector at Chicago, In place 01 J. Russell Jones, was opposed on tbe ground tbst no obarges were made against /ones, and tbat tbe 8enate ongbt not to tolerato bis removal therefore. Tbe administration Senators, on tbe contrary, malntaioed that tno only ques tion beiore tbe Senate was whether Smith, ? the President's nominee, waa a fit and proper man. If be was, tben be ought to be confirmed. They argued tbat the President bad a right to select bis subordinates, for whoso acts he Is responsible, and tbat it might easily happen that a person egainst whom no charges of actual misconduct were brought by the President still ought to no replaced by anottoer man, lor tbe benefit of the public servloe; that, there fore, even If Jones wore not charged with misoonduot, the President's right to remove blm and to pat a good man in his plaoe should not be disputed. Mr. Smith wss thereupon confirmed, nearly two thirds or the Senate voting for blm. An overwbelm . Ing majority of the Senate are, therefore, of opinion that what !? called tbe "courtesy of tho Senate" shall not role, and tbat the President shall be supported In all proper appointments. Thero is no doubt that this foreabsdows tbe action of tho Senate on all the ap pointments. ? AN 

EFFOBT TO MAKE PACKABD COLLECTOR AT NEW ORLEANS?THB PRESIDENT'S BACK BONE. The first fruits pf seating Mr. Kellogg In the Senate are already ripening. To-day a large number of re publican Senators *and most of tbo republican Representatives united In a petition to tho Presi dent to nominate Mr. Packard Collector of New Orleans In plaoe of Mr. Effingham Lawrence, whose name was sent In, but failod to be reached. This petition Is to be talcen to tho President to-morrow. The movement originated In tbe Senato. It will probably be unsuccessful, as the President holds, with tho Cincinnati platform, that it la highly Improper for Senators or Representatives, the former sitting as Judges, to confirm or rsject appointments, the latter as accusers to Impeach for wrongdoing, to interlere with tbe Executive in his constitutional duty of selecting and nominating officers. Mr. Lawrene> Is n good republi* ' tan. The matter >with blm is that be < Coes not bolong * to tbe Kellogg-Paokard ?ring ot the party In Loalshtna, hence this movement. Thero are numerous rumors to-night to tho effect that the President is alarmed and means to back dovta, but ftley are false. It will be found that be does not scare worth e cent. THB INDIAN COMMXS8I0NBB8HIP IN ABEYANCE. Too nomination of Mr. Hajrt as Indian Commls ?lonsr was not reaobed la the exocutive aossion, and falls, though h? should have been confirmed by a majority ol four to one had his name come upt Ho has been to lor an extremely efflciont Com missioner, and the Indian Ring has made great efforts to prevent bis confirmatloa Under tbe Tenure of Office act tbe office of Indian Commissioner is now In abeyance, and this causes ao great an inconvenlonoe that the rresidont this stternoon sent in his namo again and it will come up among the first In tbe nest executive seesion. The office of Collector of New Orlesns is slso In sbeyanoe, and if tbore wore a strlot construction ot the Tenure of Office act tbe port of New Orleans would be closed until tbe confirmation, of a new Collector. Tbe Senate to-day adjourned uatll Thursday. FROM OUR REGULAR CORRESPONDENT. Wahhikotox, Deo. 3,1377. rax pbesideht's message and the impres sion XT CHEATED. The rfading of the President's Message in the House io-day did not attract ss much attention as It would bad the document not been generally circulated IB pamphlet lorm. Hie views, however, on the money question were discussed among Senators and Representatives snd the stiver ?avooates end antl-reeumptionists scknowleged that they eould not hope Tor his approval for any measure that might be psssed by Congress affecting the finan cial question. On the democratic side . the Southern polloy of the President was of lourse warmly approved. In conversation mem bers from Illinois, Alabama, Kentucky, In llana, Ohio, Missouri and other Wostern Ststes took exceptions to the President's views on the re oonetizatlon ol stiver. Even republicans Irom the Northern and Eastcru Stutes questioned the Pres ident's opinions la regard to silver romoaetlzation. ?r- Cos, ol Ohio, said tUat after all It w*s only a matter ol method, and that in the end It might be found that tbo President VM right Nr. Pry#, of Maine, did net believe in making gold the only coin standard, while Mr. Hale, his colleague, ssld that the President's views were as "squaro as a brick" on the fluanclsl questiou- General Garfield fully Indorsed the Presi dent's financial polloy and believed It would be upheld by the sober sense ol Congress. Mr. Monroe, ol Ohio, .thought the Messsge an able document and sound on the silver question. Tbo republican members Irom Penn sylvania, with a lew exceptions, wero glad that tho President had taken such a bold stand as be hsd. Mr. Baker, of New York, commended the financial features, and thought It would slve direction to legis Istlou. Mr. Thornborgb, repuolican, ol Tennessee, did not like the Southern polloy part ol the Message, otherwise It was a good document. Mr. Hubbell, of Michigan, was not as favorably Impressed as he ex pected fee would be, but would not quarrei with Mr. Hayes In his finsnclal views. Mr. Schlelober, ?I Texts, was more Interested in that part which related to the Mexiean question, and thai was, at loast, satisfactory. Mr. Reagan, of Texas, was divided in his opinion, domo ^aria were goodsnd some were not so good; tbst was nil he ?ould say. Mr. Buckner, of Missouri, who is Chair man of the Banking and Currency Committee, said the President was aiming very high and stood on ex tremely blgb ground. General Ewlng thought be could sea veto written all ovor tho document, which was not encouraging to the friends of the Silver bill that pained the Bouie. Mr. Snyler regarded It as ao able document, but slight ly weak on the ellver question. Mr. Morrison bad no opinion on the merits df anything tho President said or recooiracndod. Mr. Franklin, ol Missouri, dlt ecrnod tho hand ol Secretary Sbermsu lu every line of the financial programmo and looked upon It as strengthening the bondholders. Mr. Honker, ol Mississippi, said Ills people were more interosted In the seizure of logsaand the interruption ciused to the lumber L u > I u e * a by the action ol the In terior and Treasury departments, and would to-mor row ask tne appointment of u committee to Invest)* pile the sul>|ont.

Tbe President'* recommendation to inereniie the srmy to 30,000 men will not, so far as tbe Military Committee la oonoerned. be favorably reoommended. GENERAL TEUBX'S RKI'ORT OP UIS VISIT TO BI7TIMO BOLL'S ENCAMPMKNT. General Terry, who has been bere some days pre paring Uts report tu regard to tbe Sitting Ball com mission, filed copies of the repart to-day with the Secretaries of War and tbe Interior. Tlio re port sets forth in detail all tbe circum stances in counecilou with tbeir visit to Sitting Bull's encampment, snnouooes tbat the object lor wbluh they were sent was not successful, aud, recog nizing tbe fact that be Is likely to remalu on Canadian soil, recommends tbat bis internment shall be ef fected as a mat i?r of security to tbe border. The re port sets lorib tbat so long as be is on tbe bordor be | be will be a continusl meuace to tu* frontier, | cu-oporatlng with predatory bauds, encouraging ! incursions in tbe white settlements and be a disturb ing element generally. General Terry particularly points out tbe necessity for having him promptly re | moved. This will be tbe subject of diplomatic cor [ respondenoo between tbe State Department and the ! Canadian authorities, snd tbe latter will undoubtedly require Sitting Bull and bis followers to looate at a considerable distance from our lino. AN OUTBREAK OF THE SIOUX FEABZD. General Terry last week received Information tbat a Urge number of Sioux Indians, being transferred Irom the old Red Clona and Spotted Tall agencies in Nebraska to the bow agencios In Dakota on the Missouri River, had broken loose Trout 'the parties and evldontly Intended raiding on tbeir own account. To-day be- received a despatch from General Ruffles, Assistant Adjutant General, to tbe efleot tbat Indians bad committed depredattocs upon tralna In the Deadwood country, and bsd already Killed seversl parties. Tbe fear was that there would be a geueral outbreak. Wbother tbeso acts of violeae* are simply colnctdest with the breaking away ol tbe Indians, or whether they are the beginning of lsdtan outbreaks could not be stated. Tbe Seventh cavalry is under orders to march as soon as possible to the country threatened, and it li hoped that the marauders may be captured. GENERAL WASHINGTON DESPATCHES. Wasbisotom, Deo.

OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS Plain Truths Regarding Our Indian Policy* Wabuisgtox, D. C., Dec. 3, 1877. Fiti.LOir-CiTir.EN9 or tuk Sbwats axd Hocsb of Kkp t*??."?TATIVKS: ? With devout gratitude to tbe bountiful Giver of til good, I congratulate you that, at the beginning ot your first regular session, you Una your country bleated with health aud peace aod abundant harvests, auft with encouraging prospects of an oarly return ol j general prosperity. To complete and make per- 1 inanont tue paoiflcatlou ol the country continues to be, and until It is lully accomplished mutt remain the moat Important of nil our, national Interests. The earnest purpoto of good oltUens generally to anil* their edorts m this endeavor It evident. It lound decided expression In the resolutions an nounced in 187? by tho national coovonttont of tho leading pollilcal parties or the country. There w?i a wide-tpreod apprehension tlfai the momentous re suits In our progress as a nation, marked by the ro cent amendmentt to the constitution, were in Immi nent Jeopardy; tbat tno good understanding that proraptod their adoption In the general Interest of a loyal devotion to the general wellare might provo a barren truce, and tbat the two sections of tho coun try ( once engaged In civil strife, might be again almost as widely scverod and dl?unltcd as tbey were when arrayed in arms against each other. Tho oourse to bo pursuod which, in my Judgment, seemed wisest !n the prosence of this emorgency was plainly Indicated in my inangural addrots. It pointod to tfce time whlon all our people deetre to soe, when a goname love of our wbole country and ol all that con oorns lio tiuo welfare shall supplant the destructive foras or mutual animosity ol races ana ol eccltonal hostility. Opinions have diHored wldoly as to tho measures best calculated to secure this great end. This was to be expected. The measures adopted by tne administration havo been subjected to severe and varied orltlolsm. Any course whatever which might have been entered upon would cortainly havo encountered distrust and opposition. Thcso measures were In my Judgment such as wore most In harmony with the constitution and with the genius ol our people and best adapted under all the circumstances to attain the end In view. Beneficent results already apparent prove tbat these endeavors are not to be regarded aa a mare experiment and should sustain and encourage us ib our efforts.

The discontinuance of tho uao of^he army for the purpose or upholding local governments In two Slates oi the Union, was no less a constitutional duty and requirement under the circumstances existing at the time than It was a much needed moas ure for the restoration of local self-govern mcnt and the promotion ol national harmony. The withdrawal ot the troops Irom such employment was effected deliberately and with solicitous care for the peace and good order ot aoolety and the protection oi the property and persons and every right ol all classes of cltlxens. The results that have followed are Indeed significant and encouraging. All apprehension of danger from remitting those States to local aclf government Is dispelled, and a most salutary change in the minds of tne people has |;egun and Is In prog, reas In every part of that section of country, once the theatre of unhappy civil strllo, substituting for susplolon, distrust and aversion, cenoord, friendship and patriotic attachment to the Union. No unpreju diced mind wilt deny that the terrible and olten fatal collisions which for several years have been of fre quent occurrence and have agitated and alarmed the public mind, have almoat entirely ceased, and tbat ft spirit ot mutual lorbearance aod hearty national In leresl has succeeded. There has been a general re establishment of order and or the orderly administration ol Justice. Instances of remeln log lawlessness have been ol rare occurrence. Political turmoil and turbulence have disappeared, uaeljil industries have been resumed, publlo oredlt in tbe Southern states has been greatly strengthened and the encouraging benefits ot a revival ol commerce between tbe aections of the oouutry lately embroiled in civil war are lully enjoyed.

It is only certaiu plain aud practical traits of such legislation that 1 desire to recommend to your attention. In any legislation providing lor a silver coinage, regulat ing Its raluc and imparting 10 it tho quality 01 legal lender, It seems to mo of greal importance that Con gross should not lose sight ol its ucnon as operating in a twofold capacity aud in two distinct dlrcoiious. THIS rutlLlU FAITH. If tbo United States government were free from a public debt us Legislature dealing wiib the question of silver coiuage would be purely soverlgu and jiovermeutal, under no reairalnts but those ot constitutional power?tbe Sublio good us a (Tec ted by tbe proposed legislation? ut in tbo actual clrcumstanoos of tho nation, with a vast pubiic dotit distributed Tory widoiy among our own oilizcns and bold in great amounts abroad, tbo nature of tbe stiver coinage meaaure as ulfectliig tills relation ot tbo government to tho holders of tbe publlo debt become* an olement in proposed logislatlou of the blgbest con cern. Tbe obligation ol the public fulih tnuscenda all questions of profit or public advantage otuorwise. Ita unquestionable maintenance la tbe dictate, as well of tuo big I: os 1 expediency, as ol tbe most necessary duty, and will ever bo carolully guarded by congroaa and tbe peoplo a I lite. The publlo debt of tbe United States to tbe amount of $729,000,000, bears interest at the rate of six per cent and $708,000,000 at the rate ol tlvo pdr cent, aod the only way in which the country can bo relieved from iho payment of incso high rates of interest is by advaniagoously refunding the indebtedness. Whethor the debt Is ultimately paid In gold or In silver coin is ot but little moroom compared with the possible re duction of inleroai cne-ibml by refunding it at such reduced rule. It ibe.Untted 8tates had tbe unques tioned right to pay lie bouds in sliver ooln tho lule beneiH from that process would be greatly overbalanced by tbe Jnjurioua eOeot of aucb Payment. It made or proposed agaiuet tbe bonsai convictions of tbe public crodltora alt tbo bonds that have been Issued since February l'i, 1873, when gold beeame the only unlimited legal tender metallic ourrenoy ot tbe country, are Justly payable in gold eoln or m com ot eqmil rain* During the time of tbeae issues Ibe only dollar tbat could be or was received by the government la exchange lor bonds was tbe gold dollar. To require tho pobilo creditors to take in repayment any dollar ol lesa com mercial value would be regarded by thein aa a repudiation of tbe fall obligation aasumod. The I bonds iasued prior to 1873 were lasued at a lime when tbe gold dollar waa tbe only coin iu circulation or contemplated by either tbe government or ibe bolders of the bonds as tbe eoln in which they *ero to be paid. It la tar better to pay these bonds la that coin* than to see in to talco au vantago of tbe untoreaeen fall of silver bullion to pay in u new issue of silver coin tbus made so much less valuable. The power 01 ibe United States to coin money and to reg ulate tbe value thereof ougut never 10 be exercised lor the purpose ol enabling the government to pay lie obligations In a coin ol Icsn value than that eootcmplaied by the parties wben tbe bonda were issued. Auy attempt to pay tbe national indebtedness in a coinage ol less commercial vaieo than tho money 01 the world would tovolve a viola tion ol the public faith and work Irreparable injury to the public credit. It waa tbe greai merit of the act of March, 1800, in atrengifceoiog tbe public credit tbat It removed all doubt as to lbs purpose of the United mates to pay tbeir bonded debt In coin. That act waa acoepted aa a pledge 01 publlo laitb. Tbe government baa derived great benefit from it in the progress thus far made In refunding ibe publto debt at low rateaof intereat. An ad&erance to ibe wise and Juat policy of an exact observance or tho public laitb will enable tbe government rapidly to reduce tbo burden or Intereat ou ibe national debt to au amount exceeding $20,000,000 per annum, and etlec| an aggregate saving to the United Slates of more than $300,000,000 bretore tbe oonda can be folly paid. 

RATIO l>?

An absolute equality of commercial value, Iree from disturbing lluciuaiiona, la. hardly attainable, anu without It an unlimited tender lor pnvRiu tr?usaciion? assigned to both metal* would irresistibly tend to drive out of circula tion the dearer coinage and disappoint the priucipal object proposed by tlte legislation In view. 1 appro hend, therefore, that tbe two conditions of a near approach to equality of commercial valuo be tween tbe gold and silver coinage of the same denomi nation, aud ol a Imitation ol tue amounis for which the silver coinage Is to be a legal tender, are essential to maintainingt>otb In circulation. If these conditions can be successfully observed the issue of silvor dollars Irom tbo Mint would sfTord material s?nisiance to the community in the transition to redeemable paper money, and would facilitate tho re sumption of specie payment and lis per manent eataollabmrot. Without these conditions 1 tear that only mischief and misfortune would flow from a coinage of silver dollars, Willi the quality ot un - limited legal tender, even in private transactions. Any expectation of tempoisry ease irom an issue of silver coinage to pass a-, a legal lender, at a rate ma terially above Its commercial value, l?, I am per iiuaded, a delusion. Nor can I think ihai there is any substantial distinction between au original Isane of liiver dollars at a nominal value materially above ttiolr eommerol.il value and the restoration of the ailver dollar st a rato which once was, but hs* ceased to bs, its commercial value. Certainly tho issue ol our gold coinage reduced lu weight materially lialow its legal tender value would not be any the Use a present debasement of the coiuago by reason of ita equalling, or even oxceeding, In weight a gold coinsge which at some pust time had been commercially equal to tbe new ksuc. In recommending that tbe regulation ot any silver coinsge, which may be aothorusd by Congress, abould obagrve these conditions of eommerclsl valus and l,milad legal tender, I am governed by Ibe feeling tlinl every possible increase should be gtven lo ibe volume of mewllic money which can be kept in circu lation, and thereby every poaaibie aid afforded to tbe people in Hie process ot resuming specie payments. It ft because of my couvienon ibat a disregard of these conditions would frustrate the good results which are desired from the proposed coinage and einbarraas w th uew Hie incuts ol contusion and uncer tainly business ol tho cointry - ibat t urge' upon your attention tneso oousiderations. I re?pectl?lly recommend to Congress tlist In auy legislation providing lor a silver coinage, ana im parting to it the quality of legal tender, there be im pres-ed on tho measure a ilrm provision exempting the publlo debt heretofore iHSued and now outstanding, from payment, either ol priuuipal or interest, in auy coinage ol less value than the present gold coinage ol me country.
