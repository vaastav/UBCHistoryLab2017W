It is net offi cially announced yet. It may even be discredited in certain quarters for a few hours as premature. Hut it can be affirmed, nevertheless, without res ervation. It was net until Tuesday that the full consummation was reached. Rus sia, France and Great Ilrltain arrived at a substantial agreement en a 'plan of action last week. There remained the necessity of getting the consent of the ether three powers which were signatories of the Berlin convention, Italy and Germany agreed without much demur. Austria hesitated long, and it was net until after Tuesday's emergency cabinet council in Londen, which discussed and approved the whole plan, that the Austrian ambas sader notified Lord Salisbury of tne rather unwilling assent of the govern ment that the Russian, French and British fleets shall force the Darda nelles, if necessary, in the execution of the new policy. The selutidn of the Turkish problem provides nothing se radical as a divis ion of the Turkish empire. Such a project has, net been for a moment considered. The integrity of Turkey will be substantially maintained. The terms of the new policy have practically been dictated by Russia. There are two or thrce versions in diplomatic cirvlcs of the policy at last decided upon. This is one: That Russia shall occupy the north eastern corner formed by the Bos Bes Bos eorus and the Black sea and extend ing te a point about half way down the Bosperus; that Constantinople and the Dardanelles shall be placed under European protection, but shall remain under the rule of ( the sulten, the forts at the Dardanelles being dismantled and the passage becoming entirely free. Ne further change is suggested in regard te the integrity of the Turk ish empire. This includes also European super vision of some of the sultan's appoint ments. 

SPANISH CABINET Holds a Meetlnc for the Cnimhtnriitlen of I'renlilent Cluvelanrt's Mcmimte. Madrid, Dec 10. The Heraldo says: The cabinet held a meeting Wednesday for the purpose of considering Presi dent Cleveland's message te congress. Ex-Premier Sagasta declared that the message is of se much importance that he will wait the receipt of the full text of the document before discussing it. Seme of the Spanish newspapers de clare that the message provokes Eu rope, net Spain alone. The general opinion here is that the references te Cuba and Spain contained in President Cleveland's message te congress show that it is the intention of the United States te conform mere and mere te the Menree doctrine every time a case arises te which that princi ple is applicable. The cabinet, after debating the text of the message Wednesday, will form some definite judgment, which it is be lieved will result in 'a modification of the relations of Spain with the United States. The Ileralde says that the presi dent's message foreshadows the inter vention of the United States in Cuba in March next, but adds that Spain will repel the arregance of the American government.
