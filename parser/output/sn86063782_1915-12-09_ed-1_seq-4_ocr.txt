COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR GREATER NAVY. Always L?had to It at Our Firtt and Chief Llna of Defense. The program which will Ik- laid DwFure you by tba secretary of the nary Ik similarly conceived. It Involves only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall he carried - aut, but It does make definite and ex- i plldt a program which h.i-i heretofore baas only Implicit held in the minds of the committees on na\ a! ah airs nud disclosed la the debates of the two | bosses, bat nowhere formulated or for | oally adopted. It seems to me very clear that It will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt comprehensive plao for putting the oevy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency and to pi."-* that plan to completion within t Ik* next five yesra. We have always looked to the nary of the country as our nrsi uiju chief lino of defense; we have always Men It to bo our manifest course of prudence to bo strong on tbe seas.

SHOULD A2REE ON POLICY IN THE PHILIPPINES. Reoommencis Early Adoption of Measures Giving Them Fuller Justice. The president recommends the early adoption of bills for the alteration and reform of the government of the Phil ippines and for rendering fuller polit leal justice to the people of Porto Itico. which were submitted to the SixtyI third congress The president refers ! to the Increased cost of carrying out the plans for the armed forces of the I nation and tells of the fiscal problems confronting the government. On tlie 80th of June last there was i an available balance in the general fund of the treasury of $104,170,103.78 The total est mated receipts for the year 191G, on the assumption that the emergency revenue measure passed b,\ the Inst emigre's will not be extended beyond Us present limit, the 31st of December, 1913. and that the present duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will be discontinued after the 1st of May 1910, will be $1170.303.000. The balance of June last and these estimated rev enues come therefore to a grand total of $774,033,003.78. The total estimated disbursements for the present fiscal year. Including twenty-five millions for the Panama canal, twelve millions for probable deficiency appropriations and $30,000 for miscellaneous debt redemptions, will be $733,891,000. and the ha! once in the general fund of ?!ie treas ury will be reduced to $2<M;4-1.t::i3.7H The emergency revenue ac t il' eontln ued beyond its present time Hniltntion would prodn e during the half year then rem tuning about forty-one millions. The duty of 1 cent per pound on 6ugnr If continued would produce during the two months of the fiscal year remaining after the 1st of May about fifteen millions. These two sums, amounting together to fifty-six mil lions. If added to the revenues of the second half of the fiscal year would yield the treasury at the end of the year an available balance of $70.0-14 005.78. The additional revenues ivuui.-cd to carry out tlie program of niiiit try and naval proptiratlon of w!i'"!i i have spoken would. as at present e imati- l bo for the tiseal year 1017 S'vj.scti.o t Those figures. taken with tbe figures for tbe present fiscal year which 1 have already given, disclose our linan eial problem for tbe year 1017 As suming that the taxes Imposed bv the emergency revenue net and the nres ent duty on sugar are to be dlscontln tied and that the balance at the close of tbe present fiscal year will be only $20,014,005.78. that the disbursements for the Panama ennn) will again he about $251; A000 and that the nddl tlonal c v;? "li'ures for the army and navy are authorized by the congress tbe deficit in l' e general fund of the treasury on the :!0th of June. 1017 will be nearly *235.000.000. T<> this sum at least $"0,000,000 should bo add ed to represent a safe working balance for tbe trensury and $12,000,000 ro include tbe usual doll ieucy estimates i i 1017, and tLce additions would make a total deficit of some $297,000,000. If the present taxes should be continued throughout this year and the next, however, there would be a balance In the treasury of some $70.30:\o 0 a! tlx* end of the present fiscal year and u deficit nt the end of the next year of only some r".u< t.000. or. reckoning in $ti2.G0U.0( o for deficient upriations and a safe treasur ice nt the end of the year, a t? w h > some $112,000,000. The e : of the figures is that It is ; < i - el <?f prudence to contlr. of the present taxes or their en *s mm confine ourselves to the problem of providing $112,000,000 of new revenue rather than $297.000.0'K). rJow shall we obtain the new revenue? We are frequently reminded that there are many millions of bonds which the treasury is authorized under existing law to sell to reimburse the sums paid out of current revenues for the construction of the Panama canal, and it is true that bonds for the amount of ?222.4112,000 are now available for that purpose. Prior to 1913 tfl3S.Oo0.000 of these bonds had uc::eilir h,.<,n snl.l to ree.iUO the GXIK'Udl turcs at the isthmus. and now constitute a considerable item of the public debt, But I for one do not believe tbat the people of this country approve of postponing the payment of their bills. Borrowing money is shortsighted finance. It can l?e justified only f 1 J : wben permanent, things are to bo accomplished which many generations will certainly benefit by and which It | 6eems hardly fair that n single general tlon should pay for. The objects we are now proposing lo spend money for cannot be so classified, except in the sense that everything wisely done may be said to be done In the Interest of posterity as well as In our own. It i seems to me a clear dictate of pru j dent statesmanship and frank finance that in what wo arc now, I hope, about to undertake we should pay as we go The people of the country are entitled to know just what burdens of taxation they are to carry and to know from the outset now. The new bills should be paid by luternal taxation. 

NATION'S SECRET FOES SHOULD BE CRUSHED. Gravest Danger to Country Comet From Within Our Own Borders. The president says that the precise reckonings of the problem to be met are set forth in the report of the secretary of the treasury.

Wo are at peace with all the nations of the world, and there is reason to hope that no question in controversy between this and other gov ernments will lead to any serious breach of arnical>'e relations, grave as some differences of attitude and policy huve been and may yet turn: out to be I am sorry to say that the gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders. There are citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, born under other flags, but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of America. who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life, who have sought to bring the authority und good name of our government into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever thev thought it effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at them and |to debase our politics to the uses of loEQlgn intrigue. Their number Is noi great as compared with the whole number pf. those sturdy hosts by whic i our ns-j tlon lias been enriched in r* cent generations out of virile foreij n stocks, but it is great enough to have brought doon dlsf'raoo nnnn us nn<f to have utuue it i.ect. snr.v that flLg should promj tly make use of procefcjfl of law by which V. c i:; v b^.nriy^jj^thplr corrupt distempers.

A little while ago such a thing would have seemed incredible. Because It was incredible we made no preparation for It. We would have been almost ashamed to prepare for it. as if we were suspicions of ourselves, our own comrades and neighbors! Rut the ugly and incredible thing has actually come about, and we arc without adequate federal laws to deal with it I urge yon to enact such laws nt the earliest possible moment anil feel that in doing so I am urging you to do nothing less than save the honor and self respect of the nation. Stich creatures of passion. disloyalty and anarchy must be crushed on They are not many, but they are Infinitely malignant, and the hand or onr power should close over them nt once.

REGULATIONS TO MEET RAILROAD PROBLEM Needed to Make Lines More Usefu Servants of Country. Id the meantime may 1 make thli suggestion? The transportation prob lem Is an exceed!vgly serious nn< pressing one in this country. Then has from time to time of late beeu rea son to font- tltnt our railroads woul< not much longer bo able to c-ope witl it successfully, as at present equlppee and co-ordinated. 1 suggest that i would be wise to provide for a com mission of Inquiry to ascertain by i thorough canvass of the whole ques tion whether our laws us ut presen framed and administered nre as serv iceable as they might be in the solu tion of the problem. It is obviously a problem that lies at the very foun datlon of our efficiency as a people Such an Inquiry ought to draw ou every circumstance and opinion wortl ttmgteg and we need to know all sides of the matter if we mean t< do anything in the field of federal leg [elation. No one. I am sure, would wish t< take any backward step. The regula tion of the railways of the country bj federal commissfou bus had admlrabh results and has fully justified tb< hopes aud expectations of those bj whom the policy of regulation wai originally proposed. The question li not. What should we undo? It ii whether there is anything else we cai do that would supply us with effeetiv< means, in the very process of regu lation. for bettering the conditions un der which the railroads nre operatec and for making them more useful serv ants of the country as a whole. II seems to me that it might bo the jiari of wisdom, therefore, before furtbei legislation in this field is attempted to look at the whole problem of co-or dinntlon and efficiency in the full llghi of a fresh assessment of circumstance j and opinion, as a guide to dealing witt : the several parts of it I For what we are seeking now. whni ! In my mind Is the single thought of this message, is national effi'-iency and security. We serve n great nation, We should serve It in the spirit of Its peculiar genius. It Is ihe genius o 1 common men for self government, industry. Justice, liberty and peace. We should see to it that It lacks no instrument. no facility or vigor of law, to make it sufficient to play its part with energy, safety and assured success. in this we are no partisans but heralds and prophets nf n new age ? ;; character. ; ;; it is not what a man gets, but ) what a man is, that counts. He !! should think first of character " and then of condition. He that .. has character need have no fear . || of his condition. Character will | .. improve condition.?Beecher.
