The report also shows that there is a grand total of more than 2,000,000 acres under lease at an annual rental exceeding $200,000. Two Million Acres I'nder Lease.

STRICLEN. The City Uas Another Fire With of «150,000. a Loss Hav&e , Dec. 1. — This morning Havre was again swept by fire, three of the largest structures in the city going into ruins, including the post office and its mails. The main loser was the Holland Mercantile company, which had recently Increased its stock and extended its building, and the Broadwater-Pepin Co., another build ing owner. The Great Northern hotel was de stroyed. The total loss is, approxi mately, $150,000. The insurance state ment has not been secured, but it is stated that it was well up toward the value of the building property, though low- on stock. The fire broke out in the establish ment of the Holland Mercantile com pany in the Broadwater-Pepin build ing, about 2.40 a. m. Defective wiring, all witnesses agree, was the cause of the conflagration. Havre's water pipe had just been filled up to the reservoir, but there was no water there, extremely cold weather and a delay in the arrival of pumps prevented the proper supply. Besides the losers mentioned were J. J. Tat tan, the Havre phamacy, F. B. Churchill, jeweler, Peter Des Rosier, general store, C. W. Voting, lodging house. The night was one of the coldest of the season. The block being tiled with lodging roomers, the suffering from individual losses was consider able. The losses directly kuown were as follows: Broadwater Pepin block, Second avenue and First street, value $50,000, and insurance, $39,3U0; Holland Mer cantile company, loss $38,000, and in surance, $28,000: F. B. Churchill, loss $3,000: Peter Des Rosier, a mercantile company, loss $15,000. insurance $6, 500; John Tattan, drug store, loss $4, 000, aud insurance $3,000; H. J. Meili, furniture and fixtures of the Great Northern hotel on which $2,000 insur ance was carried. Private losses in this hotel will probably bring the to tal loss on the structure up to $5,000.

A story which comes to the River Press from Harlem tells about the pleasant experience of a boy-resident of that town who recently returned from an adventurous trip in search of enjoyment that can only be found "away from home." Some six weeks ago, Joe Ellis and a boy companion decided to leave Harlem and take ad vantage of the opportunities of the wide, wide world. They secured a couple of horses and struck out south to the Missouri river, crossing that stream Into Fergus county, the scenic beauty and invigorating atmosphere of that part of Montana compensating in some measure for the home com forts they left behind. In a few days, however, the early wintry blasts be gan to sweep over the range, and the wanderers separated for a time to lo cate themselves in winter quarters. It was about the middle of Novem' ber, when Louis W. Hill, first vice' president of the Great Northern, was making his famous automobile trip across the country from Great Falls to Billings—a trip which resulted in the automobile getting stuck in snowbank south of Lewistown and being put out of business. Soon af ter the accident happened, young El lis arrived on the scene and became one of the party that helped to extri cate the machine from the snowdrift Mr. Hili seemed to take a liking to the boy, aud In the coursc of con ver sation soon discovered how he came to be in that locality; also that he was personally acquainted with some of the boy's Harlem relatives. Mr. Hill was a boy himself a few years ago, and still has a lively rec ollection of boyhood's dreams and aspirations. He insisted that young Ellis accompany him to the railroad with the disabled automobile; then he insisted that the young traveler go with him to St. Paul. Arriving at the latter city, Mr. Hill entertained his Harlein guest for a few days, fitted him out with new clothes and pocket money, presented him with a pass over the Great Northern to Harlem and wished him a hearty farewell as the westbound train left the St. Paul depot. Young Ellis was delighted with the outcome of his escapade, but does not propose to repeat the expert ence. a Flathead Murder Mystery. Kalispell , Dec. 4.—Coroner Tay lor with the other officers returned from the Conley ranch, near Atlanta, on Sunday night and brought the body of Guy Conley back with them It is seventy miles to the ranch from Kalispell. There is every indication that Con ley was killed on Thursday, Novem ber 23, a short time after arriving at hia ranch. He was discovered by Ed. Conley, his father, the following Tuesday. There is a suspicion of foul play, which may not be cleared away until after the autopsy. There is a bullet hole in the forehead be tween the eyes and the top of the head is literally blown off. The theory is that he had been way laid rod murdered, then dragged to the house and set up in a chair, and a bullet tired through the head of the dead man to convey the notion of sui cide. There has recently been trouble between Conley and auother rancher over a water right, but it is not known that this had any connection with the killing. _ 

AMONG Ol'R NEIGUBORS. Grist of Items Gathered From Northern Montana Exohangea. Conrad Observer: Carlos Warfield is preparing a new industry at the Flying U ranch. He is erecting a shed 125x75 feet and will feed about 200 head of cattle for the spring mar ket. Chinook Opinion: C. C. Babb and his assistants, who are working on the Milk river project will maintain their headquarters here all winter, instead of removing to Billings as was first planned. Glasgow Review: As we go to press we learn that John Rhode was found dead on cemetery hill north of town. He left for home early Friday morn ing, lost his wav and froze to death in sight of town. Chester Signal: Hereafter the re ceipts for homestead entries will have the laws relating thereto, printed on the reverse side. This is to thorough ly inform the homesteader as to his duty and to lessen the work in the general land office. Glasgow News: The Great North em is going to put on a new type of fast freight engine on the level divis ions between Willlston and Havre. The idea is to make up the time on these divisions that is lost in Dakota and in the mountains. Conrad Observer: A report from A. K. Prescott's sheep ranch about 13 miles southwest of town, states that during the storm a herder abandoned a band of 4,000 sheep on the prairie and later found his way to Collins. Reports say that 750 of the sheep have been found dead. Havre Herald: Bert Jacobs, whom the cowboys of this section will re member, has resigned his position with the Conrad-Price Cattle Co., of Maple Creek, Assa., and Pete Fergus on, another Chouteau county boy, takes his place. Bert is interested in the Dodson town site, and we presume he will boom his interests there. Malta Enterprise: Of the 1,200 brood sows brought in by the Neid ringhaus outfit, more than 1,000 died of the cholera. It is an ill wind that blows no good to somebody and the Indians of the vicinity are reveling in pork chops. The fact that the bogs died of cholera cut no ice with them and they hauled them off by the wagon load. Lewistown Democrat: Lee Bain, the Stanford woolgrower, yesterday closed the deal for about 3,000 head of ewes to the Silver Bow Butcher company of Butte. The ewes brought $4 per head which is considered an excellent price. Oue promineut wool grower has been offered as much as $5 per head for a band of ewes and the same party refused an offer of $4 per head for yearlings. Malta Enterprise: The visit paid this town last week by Special Agent Smith and F. W. Agatz, of the U. S. revenue department, resulted in a sur prise party for a number of our liquor dealers, some of whom without realiz ing it, had made sales calling for a wholesalers' license. As a result one party gave up $375 to Uncle Sam; an other $135, and others for smaller amounts. It is safe to say our deal ers will tight shy of anything of a like nature in the future. Harlem News: Prof. Lintield upon his return from St. Paul visited Har lem aud at a business of the business men held Thursday evening he told of his success in dry land experiments that will be promulgated next spring in what is known as the Cherry Ridge Patches some twenty miles north of Harlem, uear the experimental farm where the ideas of the state experi mental station will be worked out un der the direction of some capable man who is to be chosen later by the busi ness men of this city.

First Week Will Ba Da voted To Prépara* tions For Real Work. Washington , Dec. 3 —Nothing but preliminary work will engross the at tention of the senate this first week of the session. The senate is already or ganized, as it is a continuous body, and beside there was a special session lasts pring,when the new senators were sworn in. Senator, Brgndagee of Con necticut, Wametvof Missouri,-Prazter, of Tennessee, and LaFollette, of Wis consin, have not taken their seats. The two former had not been elected when the special session adjourned. Monday will be a very short session, and the senate will adjourn out of re spect for the late Senator Piatt, of Connecticut, as soon as the necessary formalities for the beginning of a new congress have been concluded. Tuesday the president's message will be rrceiv.'i.l and read. Wednes day is likely to be devoted to the in troduction of the bills. A short ses sion will be held Thursday, aud the senate will then adjourn until the fol lowing Monday. It is quite likely that a republican caucus will be held Tuesday oi Wednesday for the purpose of or ganizing the appointment of a com mittee to fill vacancies in the senate, and for the selection of a steering com mittee for the session. It is expected that the committee vacancies will be tilled very early in the session. If the house of representatives should pass an emergency appropriation bill for the Panama canal, the senate will at once take it up and pass it, but this measure is not expected in the senate until the second week of the session. In the house Monday will lie taken up with the election of a speaker and other house officers. They will be those nominated by the republican caucus last night. It is already un derstood that the rules of the last house will be adopted as soon as the members have been sworn in. The biennial lottery for seats will be an interesting occasion on the first day, and at its conclusion the adjournment will follow. Tuesday will be devoted to the president's message and that will probably close the real business of the house for the week. Bills will be introduced every day that the house is in session from the beginning, and will be printed and referred to the committed when ap pointed. It is expected that many im portant propositions will be presented during the early days of the session Dixon Supports Roosevelt. Washington , Dec. 3.— Congress man Dixon of Montana, is in Wash iogton. He says be is first, last and always for President Roosevelt and bis poliey. "This includes the presi* dent's stand on rate legislation," he continued. Mr. Dixon sees nothing to indicate that the country is anxious to have the tariff revised. He is of the opinion that as there will be a rate control bill passed at this session of congress it would be unwise to tinker with the tariff at the same time. He says the country can rely on the republicans revising the tariff at the proper time and when occasion de* mands. Williams Will Lead Democrats. Washington , Dec. 2.—The demo crats of the house today unanimously nominated John Sharp Williams of Mississippi for speaker of the house. The caucus was called to order by Mr. Hay of Virginia, who was the chairman last year. Representative Henry of Texas was unanimously elected chairman. Without parliamen tary business, John Sharp Williams was unanimously nomiuated by the cauuus. Mr. Williams addressed the meetiug, making au earnest plea for harmonious action for the benefit of the party. In his speech Mr. Williams out lined the democratic policy, especially as being opposed to any ship subsidy and in favor of strong anti-trust leg* islation and railway rate legislation. He said that he and other democrats had been accused of following a re publican president in the matter of rate legislation, but declared that if a republican president took democratic principles, that was no reason why democrats should abandon them. For a Pure Food l.aw. W ashington , Dec. 2.—Federal con trol of foods, drugs and liquors, for the purpose of securing their purity, is provided for in a comprehensive bill to be introduced in the senate at an early dale by Senator Hey burn of Idaho. Jurisdiction of the govern ment over these articles of interstate or foreign commerce, and a penalty of a maximum tine of 9500 and one year's imprisonment is provided for violators of the regulations set forth. The measure defines what shall con stitute misbranding and adulteration in the article over which it assumes jurisdiction. A Fearful late. It is a fearful fate to have to endure the terrible torture of piles. "I can truthfully say," writes Harry Colson, of Masonville, la., "that for blind, bleeding, itching and protruding piles Bucklen's Arnica salve is the best cure made." Also best for cuts, burns and injuries. 25c. at W. J. Minar's drug store.
