Tho evidence that ODonnell took pasxnga on tho ship that boro Carey to Australia with the design of killing him was not unimpeachable Tho testimony or thocrowns witnesses was contradictory and weak on many points essential to tho establishment of a caso of premeditated murder such as justllled the finding or a capital verdict Though tho prisoners de fense that ho took Careys life wlillo resisting an assault or tho latter was soon broken down hy the searching examination of his own witnesses it was not mado plain that the murder was wholly unprovoked A convic tion was expected but u capital

Tho correctness of this view has been verified by the attitudo or the Itepublican party It has thrown oil its disguise and is forcing n bloody shirt campaign in which the Ksuo will bo the ncgio The first move to that end lias been entered upon In congress Upon tho Jlrst day of the organization of tho senate two Itepub lican members or that body Senators Edmunds and Wilson brought for ward bills which nro Intended to put lu motion the discussion which they hopo to havo tho Xorth and South tako up and divide upon Tlio Jlrst of these that or Senator Mdtuuiids gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases wherein the issue at trial aflects the race color or previous condition of servitude or cither or the par tics thereto Senator Wilsons bill on tlio other hand looks to tho adoption oHi constitutional amend ment securing to tlio negroes those privileges which tho supremo court declares are not embraced In the four teenth or lifteouth amendment Neither of thu authors of these bills really desires to secure to tho negro those rights which both pretend to bo so anxious Unit that race shall enjoy If they did they would go about It to secure that result in a moro simple and direct

consti tutional lawyer and fully acquainted with this fact Therefore tlio insin cerity ot his pretense that It Is in the Interest or the colored race is exposed and tlio hypocrisy of Hepublicau pro

between tho two sections and in a word to inaugu rate a bloodyshlrt campaign for 1861 It Is expected that tho Demo crats In congress will oppose and de feat the bill That is what its origina tors want They do not expect It to beeoino a law and do not want It to Hut it will serve their purpose of an excute for an onslaught on the South and tlio revival of sectional animosity and thai Is all they ask of It If ony body has over doubted the purpose of the Itepublican party to light tho bat tle of laSi upon a bloodyshirt plat f Vin this authorized and concerted move or tho leaders or that party will
