Chandler is gone? We are afraid he cannot bo very stalwart under the circum stances. IT ia reported from Washington that the Democrats in Congress are not at all pleased by the finanoial recommendations of Mes3rs. Hayes and Sherman. It would be more wonderf al if they were pleased. JOHN SHERMAN is reported to be indignant because of the piemature publication of his report. Tho people have abetter right to be indignant at the premature recommenda tions it contains. These would be in ample time five or six million years hence. A FEW hot-heads from the South are call ing for Grant and monarchy as a pleasing change from the existing order of things. Almost anything, it is true, would be an im provement upon our present conditio*, but this would be equivalent to jumping from the frying pan into the fire. MILWAUKEE IS talking of getting up an annual exposition ot the products of that town. If we are not mistaken that city has a permanent exhibition of the article. A sample may bo obtained every second door, at the rate of five cents, and in a few local ities one can get "zwei glass fur fauf cent." MB. 

THUEMAN is of the opinion that the defeat of Ewmg Ohio was not a result of any Dtsmociatio blundering. The campaign was full of blunders, and if the Republican was the party guilty of such mistakes, we would advise the Democrats to waste no time in commencing to blunder. It will greatly improve its prospects of success bj such a course. As yet the state department has received no answer from Great Britain in relation to the Fortune Bay outrages upon our fisher men. There is no explanation of the delay, but it is supposed it is due to the fact that England proposes to justify the conduct of the Canadians, and is now engaged in gath ering evidence bearing on the subjeot. If this is the ease Mr. Evarts will doubtless have a ohanoe to measure diplomatic swords with the British secretary of foreign affairs. THE fiist act of Mr. Hayes on the assem bling of Congress was to send in the name of Secretary McOrary to be a United States ciromt judge, in place of Dillon, resigned* It is very evident that Mr. Hayes is anxions to make room for our Aleck in his cabinet, but Congress may not feel disposed to grant him tho opportunity as the office of secre tary of war will have to be vacant before it can be filled, and MoCrary will not surren der it nnul he is settled down for life in a judgeship. A 

DISPATCH from Washington states that the present month will develop some extraor dinary things in the political line at Wash ington. The Republicans claim that the result will be the complete annihilation of the Grant boom, while Mr. Speaker Itandall claims that before- the close of the session Mr. Tilden will be the only person spoken of for the Democratic nomination iu 1880. We are inclined to think that both parties are following what will prove to be more or less of an ignis fatuus. Whatever Congress shall do will make but little change in the present aspect of the Presidential question. THE SUPREME COURT. Among some of the complaints to whioh Mr. Hayes, in his annual message, gives voice, is the fact that the supreme court of the United States is overburdened with busi ness, and as a consequence the decision of oases is greatly hindered to the great incon venience and often to the pecuniary injury of litigants. There are now a sufficient num ber of cases filed for a hearing before that tribunal to ocoupy the justices for three years to oome, and those having important matters pending will be likely to be obliged to possess their souls in patience for that length of time before knowing their rights or daring maintain them. The remedy sug gested by the attorney general and approved by Mr. Hayes, is the appointment of addi tional oircuit judges and the creation of an intermediate court of errors and appeals which shall relieve the supreme court of a part of ite jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the performance of oir euit duties. It would involve, if tea addi tional circuit judges are appointed, an ex* penditure at the present rate of salaries of not more than $60,000 a year, which would certainly be small in comparison with the objects to be attained. To our mind the remedy is notan adequate one. Nine times out of ten the litigants who now carry their grievances to the su preme court will never be satisfied with any decision by a lower tribunal. The estab lishment of a court of errors or appeals, .thereforeunless its decisions shduld be* made Amiwould only delay the advance ment of causes t the court of last resort and increase the oost of litigation. It would compel a man asserting his rights to con tend for them in fonr or five different courts instead of three or four as at present, and proportionally increase the business. A far better plan, it seems to us, would be to re- br&^A ps^H^^f "^W:^W^ lieve the supreme judges of all circuit duty so as to enable them to devote their entire tin.e to theconsideration of causes that may be brought before the supreme court proper. By adding, say, two more to their num ber, the work might be greatly expedited, and the large business now on the docket cleared off. Such a course, however, would involve the necessity of increasing the number of circuit judges also, or of re distributing their work. Three or four more circuit jadges could, no doubt, fill the de ficiency created by the retirement ot the su preme judges from circuit duty, as there are some whose labors are now insignificant and might be increased without imposing any grievous hardship upon them. There is no doubt some Congressional ac tion needed regarding this matter. There are plenty of good lawyers in both houses whose practice in the supreme court will enable them to see the evils existing and suggest abetter remedy than the establish ment of intermediate courts that only tend to hinder rather than facilitate litigation. If it is the object to discourage the people who may think themselves wronged from seeking redress by legal means, it will be accomplished in part by this extra ju dicial machinery. But this is not the true idea of justice. Access to the courts ought to be obstructed as little as possible, for every citizen, no matter how humble, has a right to recourse to legal remedies for inju nes he may suffer. By speedily hearing and deciding all causes much hardship would be prevented, for it is no uncommon thing for appeals to be taken to the supreme court for the simple purpose of delay and in the hope that compromises may be made pending the hearing that will do an injury to one of the contestants. 

REDUCE THE EXPENSES. The report of the secretary of the treasury conveys some very interesting and suggestive facts connected with our finances that it would be well for our oitizens generally to read and inwardly digest. It is shown that the total ordinary expenses for the fiscal year ending June 80,1879, were, in round num bers, two hundred and sixty-seven millions an increase over the previous year of nearly thirty millions. The actual and estimated expenditures for the current fiscal year, end ing June 30, 1880, amount to the round sum of two hundred and sixty four millions, and for the succeeding year to two hundred and thirty-eight millions. The increased amount expended last year was due largely to the payment of the Halifax award and the arrears of pensions, thoagh most of the departments show an increase over 1878, There is a de ficiency in the sinking fund of over thirty millions, but a small amount having been transferred to that account daring the year. These enormous expenditures, actual and estimated, indioate great prodigality on the part of onr officials in the |disbureement of the people's money, and a disposition to keep up the lavish establishments as far as possible in the future. Deducting the pen sion roll and the interest on the public debt' the only two expenses that are attributable to the late war, we find that the ordinary ex penses of the government amount to the enormous sura of nearly a hundred and fifty million dollars annually. The last year's expenses of Buchanan's administration the most extravagant year of Democratic rule in our historywere less than ninety millions, which shows that the wants of our office-holders have increased to the extent of over sixty millions of dollars a year, and this after deducting liberally for what are known as war expenses. We suggest that it is about time a reform was instituted. The men who pay our taxes are obliged to be content with less remuner ation for their labor than at any time since 1861, and it is nothing more than fair to de mand of their servants holding official position that they likewise consent to a re duction of their emoluments to an ante-war basis. There are too many officials Who are too extravagantly remunerated for very un satisfactory work. Congress oan begin at the present session to apply the knife to all excessive appropriations, and insist that Mr. Sherman shall apply the surplus revenue to a reduotion of the publio debt, so that the interest account may be redaoed as far as possible.

A Protest Fro in Governor FillsborySec retary McCrary's Reply. At a meeting of the ohamber of commerce a few weeks sinoa the joint resolution of Congress, approved June 20, 1879, relating to abridge aoross the Detroit river, at or near Detroit, and providing for the ap pointment of aboard of engineers to con vene at that oity to consider the subject, was discussed at length. A protest was sent the secretary of war, and the Governor was t-Iao asked to tend a protest, which be did as iollows: ijTATIS OF MlJNESOrA, 1 ExEctnifK DEPARTMENT. St. Paul, Nov. 14. 1879. Hon. George W. McOrarv, Secretary of War, Washington, D. O. Sm:In compliance with resolutions of the ohamber of commerce of St. Paul, and pursu ant to my own convictions upon the subject, 1 beg leave, respectfully, but earnestly, to pro test against the construction of abridge across the Detroit river,as contemplated by the board of engineers whioh I understand are to meet in Detroit on the 18th inst, for the consideration of that and other matters. I need scarcely state that the vast and grow ing commercial interests of thin State and of the rapidly settling country north and west, de mand unobstructed navigation through the great lakes and their connecting channel*. It is indeed difficult to exaggerate the magnitude of these interests or the rapidity of their growth. The annual wheat export of this State alone exceeds twenty-five millions bush els, a large proportion ot whioh seeks water transit to the seaboard by all the great lakes. A much larger proportion of the increasing products of Dakota is dependent upon this route alone for the means of reaching the mar ket, while the transportation which will be re quired to keep pace with the development of the agricultural and mineral resources of the vast conntrv drained by the Northern Pacific ri'lroad baffles computation. An ample, unimpeded water communica tion must for a long time be the only means of successful defense against exactions of railroad combinations, with which these great interests are constantly threatened. Anything, therefore, which jeop ards in any manner this free water transit as a means of corns eting transportation is justly a cause of serious alarm. That the proposed bridge over the Detroit river will prove an ob struction to such free navigation cannot be doubted, and I therefore, on behalf of the peo ple of this State, and of the vase country whose interests are deeply involved, protest against its construction. Most respectfully, your obe dient servant, J. 8. 

PILLSBUBY, Governor of Minnesota. To this Secretary MoCrary returned the following reply: WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON CITY, November 25, 1S79. SIB:Acknowledging the receipt of your communication of the 14th inst., protesting against the construction of abridge across the Detroit river, 1 have the honor to enclose here with, for your information, a copy of the re port upon the subject by the acting chief of enineers,-dated November 22, which contains a copy of the joint resolution of Congress, ap proved June 20, 1S79.. pursuant to which the board of engineer officers, to which yon refer, was ordered to convene at the city of Detroit, Michigan, and whioh, it will be observed, does not authorize the construction of a bridge. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, GEO. W. MCCRABV, Secretary of War. To the Governor of the State of Minnesota, St. Paul. TO.E SKOUStc etiocK. Messrs. Zahra & Mann Bid it Offat $51,400. The entire stock and fixtures of A. Strouse's dry goods store were sold yester day morning by Sheriff King.^ The sale was attended by a large number of dry goodb merchants of this city, and representatives of several Eastern firms. The sheriff, after making the preliminary arrangements, stated that tha stock woulct be sold in a lump and the lease of the store at a rent of $200 per month would go with the sale if the pur chaser desired. The stook had been inven toried at $78,000, and the terms of the sales would be $7,000 down and the balance be fore Saturday night. Bids were then called for, the sheriff announcing that the judg ments in his hands amounted to $47,000 and he would reserve the right to reject bids under that sum. The bidding commenced at $25,000 and rapidly advanced to $49,000, at which point the sheriff announced that the sale would be positive. The bidders, among whom were noticed representatives from Lindeke, Warner & Schurmeier, William Lee, Esterly & Heine mann, D. W. Ingersoll & Co., Mannheimer Bres., A. H. Strouse, and several Eastern firms, then dropped out of the field, leaving the matter to D. W. Ingersoll, of Ingersoll & Co., and Henry E. Mann. The figures then went up at $25 advances until $51,300 was offered by Mr. Ingersoll. Mr. Mann raised that sum $100 and the entire stock, fixtures and lease were accordingly knocked down to him for $51,400, The purchasers of the stock, Zahm & Mann, are enterprising young men engaged in the dry goods business at 110 Port street. Immediately after the sale a force of clerks were put to work assorting the stock, and the intention of the firm is to open the store for business on Saturday. ST. ANDREWS DAT. The First Annnal Supper and Ball of the St. Andrew's Society of St. Paul. The St. Paul St. Andrew's society held their first annual supper and ball at Pfeifer's hall, last evening. There was a goodly com pany of ladies and gentlemen present, em bracing some of our leading Scottish oiti zens. Preliminary to the supper there was an address by the president of the society, Mr. M. Taylor, followed by songs by various members of the society, music by the Great Union band, an address by Dr. Hamilton, and various other enjoyable social exercises. Finally, shortly before 11 o'clock, the guests marched into the commodious dining halt adjoining, where a fine cold collation, with hot oysters and coffee, was spread by Booth, the Wabashaw street caterer. This disposed of, the company returned to the dancing hall, where they chased the glowing hours with flying feet through a programme com posed of twenty numbers. It was late this morning before the dancers took to then carriages and were driven home. The affair as a whole wa9 an enjoyable one, highly creditable to the society. An abridgement of the first part of the pro gramme, perhaps, would have been an im provement, and it might be well on future occasions not to give both a supper and ball on the same evening. Nothing occurred, however, to mar the harmony of the occa sion, and all present were seemingly well satisfied with the entertainment. River Business and the Levee. Considerable routine business was trans acted at the chamber of commerce yesterday, but the only matter of public importance was the passage of the following resolutions of fered by Mr. McOlung at the last meeting They passed withont a word of debate.
