This is a memorable day in France, marking the climax and rupture of the relations which have existed between the church and state for centuries. Much excitement and great sorrow characterized the attendance at the last masses under the old bond. The arrest and expulsion of Mgr. Montagni, secretary of the papal nun? - ? . r ciature in i'aris, and a meeting 01 the cabinet, after which it was announced that Clemenceau will ask parliament to suppress the pensions of the clergy, to liquidate all public property of Catholics, were among the incidents of the day of such deep underlying interest to all France. ] Special Cablegram to The Star. j PARIS, December 11.?Mgr. Montagni, secretary of the papal nunciature here since the rccall of the nuncio, was arrested thl? afternoon, upon an order expelling him from France, and will be conducted to the frontier tonight. The residence of Mgr. Montagnini was earched by the police. The clergy are preparing to leave the clergy house by tomorrow. Cardinal Richard. archbishop of Paris, has declared his readiness to leave his palace at the first sign of the government's agents. The front pages of the newspapers today are entirely occupied with the question of the church and state situation, which is the dominating topic of conversation everywhere.

ROME, December 11.?Signor Mirabclll, republican, at tho opeplng of today's session of the chamt>er of deputies Introduced a resolution, which was adopted, to the effect that the chamber sends ItB warm congratulations to France on the antl-clerlcal policy which It Is following, "as tending to secularize the state and render the hu man conscience Independent." An Historic Day. PARIS. December 11.?This is an historic day for France. The struggle which began in 1880 with the banishment of the Jesuits ended today with the legal rupture of the bond which for practically a thou sand uninterrupteu years nuu umiru church and state. By refusing to make the required declaration under the public meeting law of 1881, public Catholic worship, rxcept by schismatic organizations, tomorrow becomes illegal. The scenes In some of the churches were extremely touching. Not in "years had tlwre been such an attendance at mass. The nuiubci of women was especially large and was noteworthy as indicating the religious Indifference of the male population. Although seven-eighths of the Inhabitants of this city are nominally Catholics, In no >arts of the city were the churches crowded. Even at Notre Dame cathedral, where a (olemn high mass was celebrated, the edifice was only half filled. The officiating clergy read the regular offices for the week is usual, without referring to their Illegal tatus tomorrow. Nevertheless, the depression of the Catholics whs manifest. Many v women emerged from the cathedral with their ey<-s streaming with tears and lingered on the pavement to discuss what to do when the clergy are turned out of their churches. Resisting the Intemperate. But on the eve of the struggle it is becoming more apparent that both the gov? * nnr) KUhnw CI iiillCUl ujiivoio ????? iHftuci tvvn.oiasiiio are resisting the advicc of the intemperate. Minister of Public Worship Brian J announces that the government "cannot be driven into the trap of closing the churches," and Cardinal Richard, archbishop of Paris has strongly censured the placarding of appeals to the clericals to make violent resistance to.tlrfc officers of the law. "No violence," he says, "but passive resistance to the unjust law, v after exhausting all protests at every step." This is the disposition so far as the higher eclesiastics are concerned: but their followers evidently have no intention to submit and are preparing to assume the role of martyrs, abandon the churches and organize private worship. Cardinal Richard and many of the bishops already have begun the removal of their private effects from the episcopal mansions, and the clergy are preparing to leave their rectories and move Into hired lodgings. It is announced that the parish priests have received very many offers of places in which to hold religious services, but there is not the slightest indication that they intended to take advantage of the sole remaining chance to retain their churches, namely, by making the declarations called for by the law. Calm Front of Government. The government continues to present a calm front, although the ministers realize that additional legislative power will be necessary 11 seriuus iryuuie uccuia. celvers have been appointed everywhere to assume charge of the sequestered proprty, and three policemen will be stationed tomorrow at the doors of each of the churches to report violations of the law. but as such violations can only be tried in the police courts, and as the penalties are only fifteen fran/s fine and fifteen days' imprisonment, with the right of appeal, sterner measures may be necessary, and the government will probably accept the bill Introduced in the chamber of deputies yesterday by M. Meunier, republican, providing that all buildings, presbyteries and so on occupied bv ecclesiastics shall definitely escheat to the state, the departments and the communes upon the enactment of the law providing for the separation of church and state and at once make arrangements that the sequestered property shall not be used, like the hospitals, for special purnflSPS nr nnhHn r?

Tone of the Republican Press. The tone of the republican press of all shades indicates that if the Pope imagines that an unc jmpromisiny attitude wiH compel the French government to open negotiations with ti.e Vatican, he has woefully nvistanen the temper of the people, which favors a more hostile rather than a more conciliatory attitude. The Repubi:que Fiancaise says: "The time has passed when a Pope could Revenue Cutter Gresham Rescues the Marshall's Men. 

HIGHLAND LIGHT, Mass., December 11.?The three-masted schooner William Marshall of Boston, St. John, N. B., for New York with lumber, which was abandoned off the end of Cape Cod yesterday afternoon was up on the sands half a mile north of the Highland light life-saving station this morniiTg. The crew was taken oft by the revenue cutter Gresham just as thick weather shut in late yesterday. The Marshall was caught in last week's frigid northwester, and was sighted in a waterlogged condition last Saturday by the schooner Brina P. Pendleton, bound south. The Pendleton herse/f mas making such hoivv weather that she was not ahle to respond to signals for help from the Marshall's crew. The revenue cutter Gresham went to the schooner * aid yesterday, and when an attempt tb get a line on board the schooner failed a boat was sent aboard for the crew and the cutter then proceeded toward Boston.

The charge was fired from a double-barreled weapon and tore hie heart to pieces. A cannon ball could scarcely have done more terrible work. The police believe it to be another "Black Hand" crime. So tremendous was the charge behind tho slugs and buckshot that one ball, almost half an inch in diameter, pierced Svelazo's body, entering undor the left collarbone, passing through his body and then boring through a four-inch joist and part of the partition. Another ball entered his body below the left breast, passed out to the right of the spinal column, penetrated the partition and then had sufficient momentum to penetrate the door and be lost in the street. 1 The murder closely resembled a similar one a week ago, and only a block away, in 1st street, when another Italian saloon keeper was killed by a shot through the window of his home. All the persons concerned in both murders are Sicilians. One arrest was made directly after the shooting today. John Marcella, a Sicilian, who says he was in the front of the saloon when Svelazo was shot, was seen running from the saloon, and was stopped and arrested by Patrolman Cramer of the Eldridge station. The man told Cramer that he was looking for a policeman. Wound in Chest. The policeman found Svelazo with a gaping wound In his chest dead on the floor. A pane of glass in a window a few feet away waa blown In. and outride Cramer found how the murderer had lain In wait for his victim. aM flnnr had hppn r?lar*ed artOM two beer kegs, so that the assassin, standing Qn_lhi9 improvised platform, was on a level with the window.

LOST BY ROCKEFELLER. Jniiffmsnt Acainst Brother of John D. for $15,000. Special Dispatch -to The Star. SCRANTON, Pa., December 11.?In the United States circuit court of appeals here today Judge Archibald rendered an opinion deciding a suit brought on a $15,000 note against Frank Rockefeller, a brother of John D. Rockefeller, the Standard OH king. Frank Rockefeller was the plaintiff and the defendant was Pley Wedge, who was employed by the Standard Oil Company at Bayonne, N. J., at $0,000 a year. Frank Rockefeller, it is alleged, became interested In zinc mines in Joplin and offered Wedge $75,000 a year to manage them. Tho mines. It is understood, were unsuccessful and a cattle venture of Rockr-fi-iioi-'o in Kansas Citv became involved. Wedge claims he undertook to raise 580,000 by seeing William and John D. Rockefeller, though Frank thought his quest would be useless. Wedge, however, raised the money and Frank, Wedge claimed, told him that he would not collect a note for $13,000 that he held against him. This conversation is said to have taken place on a street car. Months later Rockefeller brought suit on the note. His contention was that the street car pledge was invalid, even if true, as no consideration had been shown. But he said it had never been made. The court below found for Wedge, holding that the extraordinary service rendered by Wedee to Rockefeller was a fair defense on the note. This the court of appeals sustains. TERMINAL IN FLAMES. Temporary Structure of New York Ferry Destroyed. NEW YORK, December 11.?The temporary terminal structure of the new Staten Island ferry at the Battery was destroyed by Are today. A new steel bridge and supporting structure for the permanent terminal buildings was seriously threatened, but the flames were kept away from it and It was saved. Had the iron framework been ruined the loss would have been increased by J40.000 and the completion of the terminal would have been delayed at least six months. The buildings burned were valued at about $10,000. Traffic from Staten Island was delayed about three-quarters of an hour as a result of the fire. Six Children Injured Coasting.

SEATTLE, Wash., December 11.?a special dispatch to the Post-Intelligencer from Port Townsend says that Capt. Willis of the British bark Melanhope, his wife and two young daughters and eighteen of a crew were picked up at sea on Friday last by the American schooner Win. H. Smith, bound for Tacoma. The Melanhope suffered severely in Tuesday's gale, her ballast shifting, and she started to sink.

Moore states that despite the pieadings of the miners and workmen the Edison company will not issue orders to blast. Moore believes that the entombed men have broken one of the water pipes running down the shaft and are keeping alive by drinking water. APPEAL PRESENTED. Attorney Clements Striving to Save Condemned Client's Life. Special Dispatch to The Star. RICHMOND, Va., December 11.?An effort is being made by Mr. James E. Clements to secure a stay of execution in the case of Joseph Thomas, alias Wright, colored, who was sentenced to be hanged next Friday In Alexandria county on the charge of having criminally assaulted Miss Mabel Risley, now Mrs. Forrest Gooding. Mr. Clements bases the application upon the grounds that grave doubts of guilt exist. Mr. Clements today submitted to the court of appeals of Virginia, at Richmond, Chief Judge James Keith and Associate Judge Cardwell sitting, a petition appealing for a writ of error on the ground named. His petition covers twelve pages, while the record of the case which accompanies the appeal embraces sixty-five pages. Attorney Clements alleges, first, the failure of Miss Risley to identify Wright as her assailant at the "crucial and psychological moment, when she first confronted him face to face at the United States jHil in Washington," and, secondly, on the allegation that doubt exists as to whether criminal assault was actually committed. The court is considering the appeal, but promises a decision by 4 o'clock today. Attorney Clements Is of the opinion that the court will decide in favor "of issuing the writ. HELD UP BY MADDEN. Explanation of Delay on the Legislative Bill. When the legislative appropriation bill was reported to the House last week a pleasant little story was circulated around the capitol and In the newspapers to account for the unusual delay there had been in getting the bill reported by the full committee. According to this story the commit-' tee had been held up by Representative Gillette of Massachusetts, who was Irritated because an anti-reform spelling proposition had been Inserted in the bill. Except for the fact that it wasn't Representative Gillette, and that reform spelling had nothing to do with It, this statement was fairly accurate. It came out today that Representative Madden of Illinois, a member of the Dlsrict sub-committee of the House appropriation committee, was solely responsible for the hold-up. Not knowing, or not caring anything about the rules of procedure In the appropriation committee, Mr. Madden demanded wlion ? ?uv itowic uuuuuiiiee was called upon to consider the bill, that th? salary of a friend of his?a House employee ?be raised and at once. That isn't the way the appropriation committee does things. Mr. Madden had made no request of that kind before the legislative subcommittee, and besides, not one of the members of the committee liked the manner in_whlch Mr. Madden couched iub aemana. so a vote was taken and he was turned down. Reports from the scene of action Indicate that the gentleman from .Chicago was very Indignant. He at first threatened to make a minority report on the bill, and as this resulted In considerable amusement in the committee, he then demanded an explanation of every other salaryvincrease In the bill. There was the hottest Kina 01 a umt ror a while, and Anally after about four hours' delay Mr. Madden announced that he wouldn't oppose the reporting of the bill any further, but that he would make It hot for the committee when the measure was taken up under the flve-minute rule. This will happen tomorrow, and several members of the committee are "laying foi'" Mr. Madden with clubs that have nails in ths end. Imuran: i msiim llfllllllllU II UUWIVIVI1 No Action Taken on Sergeant Sanders' Application. SEEKING TO RE-ENLIST Dismissed Soldiers Uncertain How to Proceed. WISH TO PROVE INNOCENCE ? im jl mi tt . j jDeueve xiiui xney nave ABiaousnea an Alibi Regarding the Brownsville Rioting. So far as known, President Roosevelt has not yet taken any action on the case of Sergt. Mingo Sanders, late of the 25th Infantry. That case is presented as a test case, and the President's action upon it will grovern the officials of the War Department and the army recruiting service at large in the treatment of all similar cases that have already arisen or may yet arise. Sergt. Sanders was one of the 170 members of the 1st Battalion of the 25th Infantry dismissed without honor because of the failure of the authorities to discover the perpetrators of the so-called Brownsville raid August 13 last. Up to the time of his discharge he had a rec<yd of twenty-six years' honorable service, and was within four years of retirement on three-quarters pay. According to the unimpeached testimony of himself and his officers and his comrades, he was asleep in his bunk at the time of the midnight raid. He has stated that he has absolutely no knowledge of the identity of the guilty men, and also that if there was a "conspiracy of silence" among the soldiers he was not a party to it. Being perfectly convinced of his entire innocence in the whole transaction, he made formal application for restoration to the army in the only possible way open to him, i.e., by re-enlistment as a private. Fol lowing the advice of Secretary Taft he applied to the military secretary and was by him referred to the local recruiting officer. His application for re-enlistment was received and recorded, together with that of two other members of the dismissed battalion. The recruiting officers, however, were completely in the dark as to the course to pursue. Although it had been reported that the soldiers who could prove their complete Innocence might_j?ceive executive clemency It was not known what form such clemency would take. The principal problems to be solved were as to the character of the evidence necessary to establish the Innocence of the soldier applicant, and as to what officer or official should pass on the sufficiency of the evidence. Because of the doubt and uncertainty as to the proper course of procedure, the case of Sergt. Sanders was referred to President Roosevelt with a view to securing specific Instructions from him on the subject. At a Loss How to Proceed. The discharged soldiers are at a complete loss as to how they can satisfy the officials of their non-participation in the Brownsville affair, beyond what they have already done. Each of them has already testified under oath as to his whereabouts on the nisrht of the raid and his ignorance of the perpetrators, and in each case the alibi was established by the only persons in a position to have direct knowledge on the point. In no single case is there any direct evidence to contradict the alibi. Inasmuch as they have already offered all the evidence they have on the subject and It has been rejected by the President, the soldiers are naturally in a quandary as to how they shall proceed. If any evidence was submitted against an individual soldier he would have some tangible point to act upon, but to prove their innocence in the absence of any specification of guilt Is a task well calculated to puzzle them. Secretary Taft's Announcement. The subject was considered by the President and the Secretary of War at the White House during the meeting of the cabinet. As a result the following announcement was made by Secretary Taft this afternoon as embodying the instructions issued to the military secretary: "The form of procedure in respect to an application for re-enlistdent by a forrer member of Companies B. C and D, of the 25th Infantry, who was discharged for the good of the service under the order of this department, dated November 9. 1906, will be as follows: "The applicant will present to the recruiting officer such evidence in writing as he desires, to show that notwithstanding such order of discharge, he was neither Implicated in the murderous raid nnnn Rrnwnfivlllp nnr nnv ovf. ! dence which might lead to the discovery of the perpetrators thereof. 'This evidence, together with the application, should be forwarded by the recruiting officers to you for the consideration and investigation of this department. Please advise the recruiting officers under your control of this. "The form of procedure I am now indicating relates to evidence having special reference to particular applicants. "It is understood that Mr. Gilchrist Stewart, representing all the men who were discharged. is about to present evidence upon the main issue to the President, whjch the President will refer to this department for investigation and report.. 

"WILLIAM H. TAFT, "Secretary of War." The Brownsville Affair. Gilchrist Stewart, representing the Constitutional League, has filed with the President a mass of additional evidence regarding the Brownsville affair, which resulted in the discharge without honor of a battalion of the 25th Infantry, colored. Mr. Stewart's papers Include an exhaustive report upon bis own visit to Brownsville and the result of his personal examination of witnesses who could throw light upon the affair. The President has before him 2he application for re-enllstment of one of the *? ? * a 1--_a ji ?Li.u u i. mscnargeu uuiuieu suiujcis, wuiuu, 11 is expected, will serve as a basis for action on his part and Indicate what must be done by the discharged soldiers to secure re-enlistmcnt.
