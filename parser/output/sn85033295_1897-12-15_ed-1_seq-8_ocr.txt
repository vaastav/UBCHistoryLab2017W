The state board of control invites the attention of the people of Wiscon sin to the state public school for neg lected and dependent children at Sparta, and asks assistance in finding homes for the children sent to that institution. There are no doubt many who would like to adopt or receive on indenture such children, but who do not know how to proceed and in fact many do not know that such an insti tution exists. The school is intended simply as a clearing house. The children sent there through misfortune or neglect are kept only long enough to find suit able homes for them to enter. They may be adopted or may be indentured until 21 years of age, after a reason able trial, should it appear that the conditions are favorable to the best interests of both the child and the family. There are about 250 children, most of whom are ready to be placed in de sirable homes. Among them are seventy-five boys from three to eight years of age, who are especially desir able for adoption. Any person desiring to take a child on trial should communicate with the Superintendent of State Public School at Sparta, Wis., who will send an agent to the person applying or will furnish any desired information concerning the children, rules, etc. —We do a money loaning, insur ance and real estate business.

The Hoppe Will .Sustained. The contested will case of Carl Hoppe, late of the tow r n of Shields, was tried Saturday, December 4. When Mr. Hoppe died he disposed of his property by a will, drawn by Philip Kiefer and signed by him as a witness, and also by Wm. Hoppe, a sen cithe deceased. Mrs. E. Tibbits and Mrs. Sumner Lewis, of this city, are daugh ters of the deceased, and each was to receive $250 under the terms of the will. They were evidently not satis fied with the shares given to them and retained Malone & Bavhhuber to con test the will. It was tried in county court and Judge Christiansen decided in favor of the contestants. An appeal was taken to the circuit court and after hearing the evidence, Judge Dick held that Wm. Hoppe was a competent witness (that being the main point in the controversy) and directed that the will be admitted to probate. Attorneys C. R.

The most astounding thing brought to light by the first week of the ses sion of congress is the audacity of the agents of the lobby which is trying to prevent the annexation of Hawaii, It is only necessary for a senator or representative of prominence to ex press in private conversation the slightest doubt of the wisdom of an nexation to have these agents an nounce through such newspapers as they control or by hook or crook obtain space in—ca,sh is unquestion ably paid in some instances—that the senator or representative in question is straining every nerve to defeat annexation. They have thus misrepresented Senators Morrill and Hoar and Speaker Reed', It seems as certain as anything can be that such audacity is in the end bound to react upon those who employ it, and to re sult in making more votes for annexa tion than against it. This lobby was started by the sugar trust, but there are reasons for believing that a por tion of ttie money it is spending so liberally comes from the secret funds of three foreign nations that desire to prevent annexation, but have no reasonable excu-e for attempting to do so openly. Some of the Demo cratic senators who talk the loudest against trusts, during a campaign, are acting in concert wilh the sugar trust now. In fact, with two excep tions, Gorman and Morgan, all the Democratic senators appear to have landed, bag and baggage, in the lob byists’ camp. Senator Davis, of Min nesota, chairman of the committee on foreign relations, which has charge ol the treaty, is thoroughly confident that annexation will be ac complished t (trough the treaty, and absolutely certain that a bill provid ing tor annexation can be passed by both senate and house, should the power of the lobby be sufficient to prevent the ratification of thetreaty. It is his intention to push the matter to a conclusion in the senate at the earliest possible moment. The house committee on appropria tions broke the record when it re ported the pension appropriation bill to the house this week, thus fur nishing evidence that Chairman Cannon and the industrious members of his committee intend to do their part towards pushing the imperative business of the session, in order to help along the project for early ad journment, which is generally fayored by Republicans. The pension bill carries $141,218,830, of which $140.- 000,000 is for the payment of pen sions. It has already been made appar ent that a serious attempt is going to be made at this session of congress to modify the civil service rules. President McKinley having stated in his annual message that lie believed many positions were now embraced by the civil service rules which ought not to be, Republicans in congress do not feel that they are antagoniz ing him or the party platform in tak ing part in tins movement, although so good a Republican as Representa tive Johnson, of Indiana, has told them in a speech in reply to General Grosvenor, of Ohio, that he disagreed with them. General Grosvenor's idea, which be will endeavor to get through in the shape of a bill, is that the only employes of the government who should he embraced by the civil service rules are the clerks, whose duties are executive, in the depart ments at Washington and employes of the postal service in all branches. All other positions he desires to have thrown open and the Democrats who now hold fully nine-tenths of them thrown out to make room for Republicans. President McKinley’s beingdetained at Canton by his sad duty lias not in any manner inconvenience 1 con gress, as he arranged all matters re quiring his personal attention before starting upon his last trip to the bedside of his dying mother. Every where his mime is mentioned the deepest sympathy is expressed for him. The committee on hanking and currency has obtained permission from the house to sir daily during sessions of t he house, and will at once endeavor to agree upon one or more hills embodying portionsof thefinan cial recommendations made by the president in his annual message and by Secretary Gage in his annual re port to congress. Secretary Gage has been asked to put his ideas into a hill and submit it to thecommittee.
