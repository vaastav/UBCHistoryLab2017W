3DAT, XEG. 2,1913 hoto by American Press Association. PRESIDENT WILSON Washington, D. C.—In his message, delivered at a joint session of the houses of congress at the beginning of tbe second session of the Sixty-third congress. President Wilson urged im mediate currency legislation, devoted couslderabie space to the needs of the farmers and referred to the Mexican crisis. The Sherman anti-trust law, he Baid. should be changed so" that its met meaning would be clearer. The president also urged the choice ol presidential nominees by the direct 

PRIMARY NOMINATIONS FOR THE PRESIDENCY. I urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections through out the country at which the voters of the several parties may choose their nominees for the presidency without the .interven tion of nominating conventions. I venture tho suggestion that this, legislation should provide for the retention of party conventions, but only for the purpose of de claring and accepting the ver dict of the primaries and .formu lating the platforms of the par ties, and I suggest that these conventions should consist not of delegates chosen for this sin gle purpose, but of the nominees for congress, the nominees for vacant seats in the senate of the United States, the senators whose terms have not yet closed, the national committees and the candidates for the presidency themselves, in order that, plat forms may he framed by those responsible to the people for car rying them into effect. Vote of the people expressed at pri maries. The message in full is as fol lows: Gentlemen of, tjie Congress—In pur-" suance of wy ^onsttiWtionai- duty to "give to the congress information of tbe state of the Union" I take the lib erty of addressing y$u on several mat ters which ought. a| it seems to me, particularly to engage the attention of your honorable body, as of all who study the welfare and progress "of the nation. I shall ask your indulgence if I ven ture to depart in sonic degree from the usual custom of sottjng before you In formal review the many matters which have engaged the attention and called for tbe action of tlig several depart ments of tiie --government or which look to them for early treatment in the future, because the list is long, very long, and woul£ suffer in the ab brevia on to which -.1 should have to stibjcct it. I shall-submit to you the reports of the liends q&. several depart ments in which these subjects are set forth in careful details and beg that they may receive the^tboughtful atten tion of your committees and of all members of the congress who may bare the leisure to study them. Their obvious Importance, as constituting the very substance of the business of the government, makes comment and em phasis on niy part unnecessary. 

WANTS TREATIES RATIFIED. Anserts That United States Leads In Peace Negotiations. The country, 1 am thankful to Bay. is at peace with all the world, and mauy happy manifestations multiply about us Qt a growing cordiality and sense of "community of interest among the na tions, foreshadowing an age of settled peace and good will. Move and more readily each decade do the nations manifest their willingness to bind them selves by solemn treaty to the proc esses of peace, the processes of frank ness and fair concession. So far the United States has stood at the front of :such negotiations. She will. I earnest ly hope and confidently believe, give fresb proof of her sincere adherence to •the cause of international friendship by ratifying the several treaties of ar bitration awaiting renewal by-the sen ate. in addition to these it has been the •Privilege of the department of state to Ciin the assent, in principle, of no less thnu thirty-one uatious, representing four-fifths of the population of the ^orld. to the negotiation of treaties by ^vtilch It shall be agreed that whenever differences of interest or of policy arise ivliio?i ennnot be resolved by the ordi nary processes of diplomacy they shall be publicly analyzed, discussed and re ported upon by tribunal chosen by the parties before cither uation det.er nilnes its course of action.

HUERTA MUST GO. Predicts Downfall of "Usurper" Who "Cast Aside Even Pretense qf Legal Right And Declared Himself dicta tor." There is but one cloud upon our hori zon. That has showu Itself to the south of us and hangs over Mexico. There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until General Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico. Until it Is understood on all hauds, indeed^ such pretended gov ernments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the government of the United States. We are the friends of constitutional government in America. We are more than Its friends we are its champions, because in no other way can our neighbors to whom we would wish in every way to make proof of our friendship work out their own development lii peace arid liberty. Mexico has ho government. The at tempt to maintain one at the City of Mexico has brokeri doivri, and a mere military despotism has been set up which has hardly more than the sem blance of national authority. It origi nated In the usurpation of Vlctoriano Huerta, who. after a brief attempt to play the part of constitutional presi dent. has at last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and declared himself dictator. As a consequence a condition of affairs now exists in Mex ico which has made It doubtful wheth er even the most elementary and fund amental rights either of her own peo ple or of the citizens of other coun tries resident within her territory can long be successfully safeguarded and which threatens If long continued to imperil the Interests of peace, order and tolerable life in the lands imme diately to-ttie south Even If the usurper had succeeded in his purposes, jjpi-ijjpspite of the con stitution of the rtjspnblic and the rights of its people, he vrould have set up nothing but precarious and hateful power which could have lasted but a little while and whose eventual down fall would havepleftt'.^he country in a more deplorable, icoiiciition than ever. But he has "not succeeded. He has for feited ttfe'respect and the moral sup port even^of those who were at one time wiping to see him succeed. Little by little-be has been completely isolat ed. By'-,iv little every day his power and prejrtfge are crumbling, and the collapse Is not far away. We shall not I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting. And then, when thjp end comes, we shall hope to see consjjtutional order restored in dis tressed J.jexico by the concert and en ergy of such of her leaders as prefer the libecty of their people to their own ambitions. 

VIEWS ON CURRENCY BILL Urges Measure That Will Prove Bene fit to Farmers—Hopos For Quick Ac tion. I turn to matters of domestic con cern. You already have under consid eration a hill for the reform of #ur system of banking and currency, for which the country waits with impa tience. as for something fundamental to Its whole business life and necessa ry to set credit free from arbitrary and artificial restraints. I need not say how Earnestly. 'liope for its enrly enactment into Jaw. take leave to beg that the whole energy and atten tion of the senate lie concentrated upon it till the matter is successfully disposed of. And yet I feel that the request is not needed—that the mem bers of that great house need no urg ing in this service to the country I present to you in addition tne ur gent necessity that special provision be made also for facilitating the credits needed by the farmers of .the country. The pending currency bill does the farmers a great service. It puts them upon an equal footing with other busi ness men and masters of enterprise, as it should, and upon its passage they will find themselves quit of many of the difficulties which now hamper them In the Held of credit. The fanners of course ask and should be given no spe cial privilege, such ns extending to them the credit of the government Itself. Whnt they need and should ob tain is legislation which will make their own abundant and substantial credit resources available as a foun dation for joint, concerted, local ac tion in their own behalf in getting the capital they must use. It is to this we should now address ourselves. It has. singularly enough, come to pass that we have allowed the Indus try of our farms to lag behind the other activities of the country in its development 1 need not stop to tell you bow fundamental to the life of the A Mm**. 

PRESIDENT- WILSON'S MESSAGE READ TO SIXTY-THIRD CONGRESS TODAY nation in the production of its food. Our thoughts may ordinarily be con centrated upon the cities aud the hives of industry, upon the cries of the crowded market place and the clangor of the factory, but it is from the quiet interspaces of the open valleys and the free hillsides that we draw the sources of life and of prosperity, from the farm and the ranch, from the forest and the mine. Without these every street would be silent, every office de serted, every factory fallen Into disre pair. And yet the farmer does not stand upon the same footing with the fores ter and the miner in the market of credit. He Is the servant of the sea sons. Nature determines how long he must wait for his crops and will not be hurried in her processes. He may give his note, but the season of its maturity depends upon the season when his crop matures and lies at the gates of the market where his prod ucts are sold. And the security be gives is of a character not known in the broker's office or as familiarly ns it might be on the counter of tin banker. The agricultural department of the government is seeking to assist, ns never before to innke farming an effi cient business, of wide co-operative ef fort. in quick touch with the markets for foodstuffs. The farmers nnd the government will henceforth work to gether as real pnrtners in this field, where we now begin to see our way very clearly and where many intelli gent plans are already being put into execution. The treasury of the United States has by a timely and well considered distribution of Its deposits facilitated the moving of the crops in the present season and prevented the scarcity of available funds too often experienced at such times. But we must not allow ourselves to depend upon extraordi nary expedients. We must add the means by which the farmer may make his credit constantly and easily avail able arid command wheu he will the capital by which to support and ex pand his business. We lag behind many other great countries of the mod ern world in attempting to do this. Systems of rural credit have been studied and developed on the othei side of the water while we left our farmers to shift for themselves in the ordinary money market. You have but to look about you In any rural dis trict to see the result, the handicap and embarrassment which have been put upon those who produce our food. Conscious of this backwardness and neglect on our part, the congress re cently authorized the creation of a special commission to study the vari ous systems of rural credit which have been put into operation in Europe, and this commission is already prepared to report. Its report ought to make it easier for us to determine what meth ods will, be best suited to our own farmers. I hope and believe that the committees of the senate and house will address themselves to this matter with the most fruitful results, and 1 believe that the studies and recently formed plans of the department of ag- 

URGE8 CURRENCY REFORM TO BENEFIT THE FARMER. President Wilson in his mes sage urges the immediate pas sage of currency legislation. He asserts that business interests of the nation are waiting on the ex pected law before making large new investments or developing resources. The president also calls attention to conditions as they exist at present, which make it very difficult for the farmer to finance his crop. He urges in his annual message pro visions that will safeguard the farmer, help his credit and pre vent a repetition of the neces sity for the governmemnt to de posit large sums of money in the southern and western states so as to aid the producer, as was the case last fall. riculture may be made to serve them very greatly In their work of framing appropriate and adequate legislation. It would be Indiscreet and presump tuous in any one to dogmatize upon sc great and many sided a question, buf I feel confident that common counse will produce the results we must al desire. 

UPHOLDS ANTI-TRUST LAW. Recommends That It Be Supplemented With More Explicit Legislation tc Facilitate Its Administration. Turn from the farm to the world of business which centers in tbe city and in the factory aiul I think that al! thoughtful observers will agree that the Immediate service we owe the business communities of the country is to prevent private monopoly more effectually than it has yet been pre vented. 1 think it will be easily agreed that we should let the Sherman anti trust law stand, unaltered, as it is with Its debatable ground about It but that we should as much as possi ble reduce the area of that debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation, and should also supplement that great act by legislation which will not only clarify it but iiiso facili tate Its administration and make It fairer to nil concerned. No doubt we shall nil wish, and tb» country will expect, this to be the central subject of our deliberations during the present session, but it is a subject so many sided and so deserv ing of careful and discriminating dis cussion that I shall take the liberty of addressing you upon It in a special message at a later date than this. It is of capital importnnce that the busi ness me:i of this country should be re tiered of all uncertainties of law with THE DAtCY 

GATE omt: /v regard to their enterprises and Invest* ments and a clear path indicated which they can travel without anxiety. It is as Important that they should be relieved of embarrassment and set free to prosper as that private monop oly should be destroyed. The ways ol action should be thrown wide open. FAVORS DIRECT ELECTIONS. Would Retain Conventions, Delegates to Be Norninees For Office, Whose Duty It Would Be to Frame Plat forms. 1 turn to a subject which I hope can be handled proiupfly and without seri ous controversy of any kind. I mean the method of selecting nominees for the presidency of the United States. I feel confident that I do not misinter pret the wishes or the expectations of the country when I urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections through out the country at which the voters of the several parties may choose their nominees for the presidency without, the intervention of nominating conven tions. I venture tho suggestion that this legislation should provide for the retention of party conventions, but only for the purpose of declaring and accepting the verdict of the primaries and formulating tiie platforms of the parties, nnd I suggest that these con ventions should consist not of dele gates chosen for this single purpose, but of the nominees for congress, the nominees for vacant seats in the sen ate of the UnitSed States, the senators whose terms have not yet closed, the national committees and the candi dates for the presidency themselves, in order that platforms may be framed by those responsible to the people for carrying them into effect. 

PHILIPPINE CONTROL. Must Hold Ultimate Independence In View and Strive to Fit Filipinos For Self Government at Future Date. These are all matters of vital do mestic concern, and besides them, out side the charmed circle of our own na tional life in which our affections com mand us, as well as our consciences, there stand out our obligations toward our territories over sea. Here we are trustees. Porto Rico. Hawaii, the Phil ippines. are ours. Indeed, but not ours to do what we please with. Such ter ritories, once regarded as mere posses sions, are no longer to be selfishly ex ploited they are part of the domain of public conscience and of serviceable and enlightened statesmanship. We must administer them for the people who live in them and with the same sense of responsibility to them as toward our own people in our domestic affairs. No doubt we shall success fully enough bind Porto Rico attd the Hawaiian Islands to ourselves by ties of justice and interest and affection, but the performance of our duty to ward the Philippines Is a more diffi cult and debatable matter. We can satisfy the obligations of generous jus tice toward the people of Porto Rico by giving the ample and familiar rights and privileges accorded our own citizens In our own territories and our obligations toward the people of Ha waii by perfecting the provisions for self government already granted tbem, but In the Philippines we must go fur-, ther. We must hold steadily in view their ultimate Independence, and .we must move toward the time of that independence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations thoughtfully and permanently laid.. Acting under the authority conferred upon the president by congress. I have already accorded, the people of the Is lands a majority in both houses of I their legislative body by appointing I five instead of four native citizens to the membership, of the commission. I believe that in this way we shall make proof of their capacity In counsel and their sense of responsibility In the ex ercise of political power and that the success of this step will be sure to clear our view for the steps which are to follow. Step by step we should extend and perfect the system of self government in the islands, making test of them and modifying tbem as experience discloses their successes and their failures that we should more and more put under the control of the native citizens of the archipelago the essential Instruments of their life, their local instrumentali ties of government, their schools, all the common interests of their commu nities and so by counsel and experience set up a government which all the world will see to be suitable to a peo ple whose affairs are under their own control. At lust. 1 hope and believe, we are beginning to gain the confidence of the Filipino peoples. By their counsel and experience."rather than by our own, we shall learn bow best to serve them and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw our supervision. Let us once find the path and set out with firm and confident tread upon It. and we shall not wander from it or linger upon it. 

PROBLEM IN ALASKA. Urges Development by Nation of Nat ural Resources and Full Territorial Form of Government. A duty faces us with regard to Alas ka which seems to me very pressing and very imperii live perhaps 1 should say a double duty, for It concerns both the political nnd the material develop ment of the territory. The people of Alaska should be given the full terri torial form of government, aud Alas ka. as storehouse.^should be unlock ed. One key to it is a system of rail ways. These the government should itself build nnd administer. and the ports and terminals it should itself control in tbe Interest of all who wish ---»"**—,-£v„ to use them for the service and devel opment of the country and Its people. But the construction of railways is only the first step—is only thrusting In the key to the storehouse and throw ing back the lock and opening the door. How the tempting resources of the country are to be exploited is an other matter, to which I shall take tht liberty of from time to time calling your attention, for It Is a policy which must be worked out by well consid ered stages, not upon theory but upon lines of practical expediency. It is part of our general problem of con servation. We have a freer hand in working out the problem in Alaska than in the states of the Union, and yet the principle and object are the same wherever we touch it. We must use the resources of the country, not lock them up. There need be no conflict or Jealousy as between state and federal authori ties, for there can be no essential dlf- PRESIDENT MAKES KNOWN HI8 PHILIPPINE POLICY. President Wilson's policy to ward the Philippine Islands is made clear in his message. He urges the development of the Philippines, always keeping in view ultimate independence of the islanders. While he does not believe they are ready for self government today he believes that eventually they will be. He points out improvement that has recently been made by calling attention to the fact that more natives have been appointed on the Philippine commission than was the case previously. ference of purpose between them. The resources in question must be used, but not destroyed or wasted used, but not monopolized upon any narrow idea of individual rights as against tbe abiding Interests of communities. That a policy can be worked out by confer ence and concession which will release these resources and yet not jeopard or dissipate them I for one have no doubt, and it can be done on lines of regulation which need be no less ac ceptable to the people and government of tbe nation at large, whose heritage these resources are. We must bend our counsels to this end. A common purpose ought to make agreement easy. bm
