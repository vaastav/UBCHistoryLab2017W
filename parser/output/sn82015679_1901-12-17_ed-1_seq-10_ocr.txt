A Resolution Presented to the Conn ell Two Ordinance Punned Mtinlclpnl Affairs. While the members of Council were hold ing an Informal smoker previous to the regular meeting last night. President Hal deman, fresh from a West Washington street car, entered the office of the city clerk and started a flurry of discussion by declaring that the bridge over White river is tottering to its fall and should be closed absolutely. Mr. Haldeman declared that the street-car company should be for bidden the use of the bridge either for empty or loaded cars until It can be placed In a condition recognized as perfectly safe by a competent engineer. Mr. Haldeman was very much in earn est and declared that Council should sus pend the rules and pass an ordinance com pelling the street-car company to abandon the structure on the ground of public safe ty. He said that if the bridge should tum ble Into the river and carry several dozen passengers of the street-car company to death the city would be held responsible and could not recover through the com pany. Mr. Billlngsley, with a pad of paper, started to draft an ordinance, while the president interviewed members generally as to whether they would support the emergency ordinance. 

WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT. Councilman Harry Negley cast a damper on the idea by refusing to vote for such a measure. "In the first place," he said, "it would have absolutely no effect. It would have to be signed by the mayor, and Mr. Bookwalter .will, not return to the city until the end of the week. It would have to contain a penal clause and conse quently could not be enforced for eight days after the mayor's signature had been obtained." Furthermore. Mr. Negley held that the question is outside the Jurisdic tion of a legislative body like the Coun cil. It is within the province of the Board of Works; and it is to be supposed, he re marked, that the board knows the gravity of the situation. Mr. Negley said that closing the bridge would .cripple the street car service of haif of the city. The idea of introducing an ordinance was given up. but instead Mr. Billlngsley Introduced the following resolution intended to express the sentiment of Council on the danger of keeping the bridge open to traf fic: "Resolved, That.it is the wish of the Common Council, that no street cars or heavy vehicles be allowed to cross the bridge over White river at Washington street until it has been examined and pro nounced safe for such travel." When the regular meeting was called the resolution provoked a lot or oratory. Mr. Billlngsley warmly, contended that it should be adopted. Councilman John Crall couldn't see that it would have the effect Intended and doubted its wisdom. Mr. Neg ley attacked the wording of the instrument and even the Democratic .members did not care to father it. As a result it was turned over to Ed Sourbier ns chairman of the commltteee on public safety and com fort for the report of his committee. There is a probability that Mr. Haldeman and other members of the Council wno think the bridge should be abandoned altogether for the time being will appear in their in dividual capacities before the Board of Works and enlarge upon the danger of keeping the structure open to traffic. TWO ORDINANCES PASSED. Two ordinances were passed at last night's meeting. The .committee on finance through Thomas A. Wynne recommended the passing of an appropriation ordinance providing $1S,1M.4S for the payment of the first fourteen, bonds of, the issue for the Improvement' of the fire department and the City Hospital and the interest on the en tire amount of the. issue. The ordinance was passed unanimously: 'On recommenda tion of the cbmmlttee rm sewers, streets and alleys the Council passed an ordinance giving a name to the. first alley west of California street running. south from Tenth street to Indiana avenue:. It will be known hereafter as Utlca street. Mr. Kppert introduced his ordinance which provides, for the . annexation of cer tain territory -lying, between Thirty-eighth street and Fall- creek and between Central avenue and Meridian -street, including with in Its limits a part of.'the estate of the late Mason J. Osgood. ' . The only other now ordinance was in troduced by Councilman Crall. It Axes the salary of the secretary to the mayor at S1.2U0. Chairman Holllday.. of the committe on sewers, streets, and alleys, announced thit the committee .will meet , next Monday even ing to consider an ordinance changing the name of a part of Bellef.ontalne street to Arhland avenue. Mr. Holllday suggested that if any remonstrators desire to be heard they will have their opportunity at the meeting. In a communication from Mayor Book waiter it was announced that he had signed the following ordinances: For the appro priation of $7.600 for the use of the De partment of Public Works; for the transfer of $2.0.0 to the fund for sweeping and cleaning improved streets; authorizing the Issue of JlDo.O) worth of new bonds. The controller sent the bond of Armin C. Koehne, as city treasurer, to the Coun cil for Its approval and the Instrument was referred to the committee on finance for its action. SAFETY BOARD AFFAIRS. Not Gam Enough to Heat Engine Hotmes Annual Coal Contract. Fire Chief Coots informed Acting Presi dent of the Board of .Safety Conrad Kel ler yesterday that hereafter the fire houres could not depend upon gas for heating purposes and that some provision will have to be made for using coal altogether. The present cold spell has demonstrated" that the gas supply is utterly inadequate to keep the houses warm and the men have been subjected to a great deal of discom fort and inconvenience. Contracts for coal sufficient to last one year will be made, it is thought. The chief also Informed the board that the department has none too many horses and if there are enough funds left in the appropriation it would' be a good Idea to purchase a few more animals. With the streets covered with ice and snow several horses are injured every day. Yesterdav three horses were put on the hospital list as a result of runs- made over the ley streets. Chief Coots expressed the earnest wish that people generally would take every precaution against fires during the dura tion of the extreme cold weather. The chief said that if a big fire should break out the department would be seriously handicapped in handling It because water would freeze in the hose pipes. It Is ten times harder work to handle a big tire In rero weather, he said, than it is when the temperature is higher. If people are careful much of the danger will be ob viated.

TO-DAY. It W 111 Determine the Action of the Hoard of Works. Chairman Megrew, of the Board of Works, said yesterday that the board ex pects to-day to receive a formal opinion from the city engineer on the state of the Washington-street bridge over White river and that the board's action will depend largely on what Engineer Nelson thinks of the bridge's condition. Mr. Nelson has already declared that the bridge i unsafe, but it is not believed he will recommend that It le closed absolute ly. It Is probable. I is stated, that he will surest measures allowing the bridge to be usd for light traffic while extensive re pair are made. For the present the street-car company is allowed to run empty cars over the bridge on Its own responsibility. Its engineer has stated the bridge look? worse than it really Is and that it is safe enough If heavily loulnl cars are not taken across. The com pany agrees to assume th responsibility for accident. It la stated. Payment of Christmas Snlnrlea. All the employes of the city will get their I cirbfr salaries in time to purchase Cl.r:tt:..as p.exvr.tJ a:id to buv Chrlstr.as turkey. Controller Breunlg announced yes terday that the salary warrants would be issued Monday. Dec. 23. Usually city of- j Jicers and employes are paid on the first of each month but th controller reels that a deviation from the usual course Is in order. Tomllnnon Hall Damngred. Somebody connected with the Grau Opera Company broke a big window In Tomlln son Hall Saturday, and the Beard of Works in addition settled a bill for $12.75 to pay for extra service In cleaning the building after the fanciers show. The i board will probably demand from all rent ers that the hall be left In as good snape as it is found. Money for the Dondi. The city treasurer received yesterday from the American National Bank S190.GS8 in payment for the bond issue awarded to George A. Fernald and Company, bank ers, of Boston.

REX HORNET ON THE SNOW STERLING R. HOLT'S HORSE OUT CLASSED ALL COMPETITORS. Some Lively Sparta on Capitol Avenue North of Fall Creek-Two Hours of Sport. The rapid strides of pacers and trotters caused the snow to fly on North Capitol avenue north of Fall creek yesterday after noon, where more than a dozen of the best horses in the city were raced for two hours. The avenue at that point affords good sleighing and is not so dangerous to pedestrians as it Is farther down town. The sidewalks and houses along the street were crowded with sightseers, as the sport was exciting, and during the afternoon many good races were seen. The majority of the events were carried off by Sterling R. Holt's Rex Hornet, while W. C. Allen and his fast speeder came in for second honors. Rex Hornet beat every thing on the street and met all comers. The racing was done on about five squares of the avenue and on this short speedway there were manly lively spurts. The middle of the thoroughfare was given over to the races while the other sleighs were com pelled to use the side of the street. The horses caused several lively spurts while returning to the starting point. Among the well-known horsemen who were in the races were Charles Shover. Jesse Adams, Ora Shover, W. C. Allen. Clay Konode, C. R. Webber. Sterling R. Holt, Thomas Sulli van, J. C. Sipe and W. N. Short. The races will be given every afternoon while there is good sleighing. CHICAGO BOY'S PLUCK. La Verne Green, "Who Eloped with Girl, Xow a Messenger. La Verne Green, who was arrested sev eral days ago in company with Marie Thompson, the daughter of a wealthy res taurant keeper of Chicago, w-lth whom he eloped, was released because there was no charge against him. He was accused of stealing a watch, which he claimed the girl had given him, and there was no evi dence to the contrary. Green, since he came to Indianapolis, has had a hard time, but has shown several good traits of char acter. He is about twenty years of age. He left Chicago with only $20, one-half of which was spent for railroad fare. After the rest was gone he went to work as a waiter in a restaurant, but, lacking experi ence, was unable to hold the position. He then took a place with the keeper of the restaurant and hotel as chambermaid, and kept it until his arrest. Immediately after being released he found employment with the Western Union Telegraph Company carrying messages. A telegraph editor, who was surprised that a man should be doing the work which Is usually assigned to boys, asked him If he did not have a story. He said he thought he had, as he had been accused of running away with a daughter of a millionaire and was now car rying messages until he could get some thing better. PAPER NOT INDORSED. Methodist Ministers Defeat a Resolu tion by a Vote of Mne to Seren. At a meeting of the Methodist Ministers' Association yesterday morning the ques tion of establishing in this city a Methodist paper was again brought up by the report of ths committee appointed last week.

OClce No lib East MArt-et street. JOHN M. SPANN. Secretary JOHN II. ii .LL1DAY, President. GEORGE B. HODGE IN TOWN A 3IEMI1ER OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF Y. 31. C. A. A Dinner Given In Ills Honor at the Commercial Club The edu cational Work. George B. Hodge, of Boston, a member of the international committee of the Y. M. C. A. and a director of the educational de partment, arrived in this city yesterday aft ernoon and was entertained by the local committees. At 6 o'clock last night the members of the board of directors of the Central Y. M. C. A., of the executive com mittee and the State Y. M. C. A. enter tained Mr. Hodge with a dinner at the Commercial Club. It was Informal and was for the members of the committee to meet Mr. Hodge. During the meal several of the local members ascertained from Mr. Hodge what he considered proper methods for conducting the educational department of a Y. M. C. A. After dinner, when the party reconvened in the assembly room, Mr. Hodge began, with the aid of a chart, to explain to the Indlanlans the great necessity of operating educational departments In connection with Y. M. C. A's. He said the question was often put to him by different secretaries of Institutions why an educational depart ment was conducted at all. To this he said the very principle of the Y. M. C. A., in looking after and building up Christian young men, included the education of the mind as well as of the body. "To do this," he said, "it is necessary for the Y. M. C. A. to bring the young men together in all branches of educational work, as It is es sential to the welfare of every young man's soul." At several points Mr. Hodge ex plained that the work of education was necessary for the good of the young men of the association. In his remarks he said that Indiana was far below In this respect her sister States. He gave Instructions as to how the work should be carried on to win success, and implored the members of the committees to not let the work lag, but to enliven It as much as possible and bring Indiana to the front.
