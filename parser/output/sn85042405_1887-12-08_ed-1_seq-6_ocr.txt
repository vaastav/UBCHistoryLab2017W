'iF* A SENATE DEADLOCK TROUBLE POSSIULE OVER THE AD MISSION OF NEW MEMBERS. ^.. The Two Great Parties Evenly Divided, With Riddlebergei1, of Virginia, Hold­ ing tlie Balance of Power—Hi# Prefer­ ences Doubtful—Washington Matters iu General. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.—Faulkner, of West Virginia, and Turpie, of Indiana, will probably sit around in Washington awhile before they take their seats in tho senate. Within the last day or two a disposition to keep them out has devel­ oped quite strongly among the Republi can senators. In retaliation the Demo crats will light the swearing in of the new Republican senators over whose election there is no contest, When horns are thus locked, Ricldle berger, of Virginia, will, as David Davis did a lew years ago, hold the balance of power, the holding over members being politically divided, 35 to 2.5, 'with Riddle berger in doubt-. On purely partisan issues the Democrats do not count on his support, however, while the Republicans are not sure of him. Washington is very much excited over the prospect of a big fljrht in tlie senate. WOOL GROWERS IN SESSION. Meeting: at Washington of Prominent Sheep Kaisers to Settle Existing Differ­ ences. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.—A large number of delegates to the wool growers' and manufacturers' conference are already in the city and an informal meeting of the earlier arrivals was held Saturday. A settlement of the differences between the producers and the manufacturers of this important staple it is confidently pre­ dicted will be arrived at before the con ference adjourns, and a revised and ac ceptable tariff will be agreed upon and immediate action invoked for its enforce­ ment. 'Twas a Blessing in Disguise* WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.—Volkmar, alias Lewis, in conversation with a reporter, said: "I have no animosity towards those local foes who have taken upon tliem selves to drive me to the wall and ruin me. They have done for me what I would not have done for myself. They have brought out the only dark spot, cleansed my record and made me l'ree, free for­ ever." Rapid City Postal Business. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The income of the Rapid City postoffico is constantly falling off, and no building will be leased (by the department.

F\ HAKT OLD COLIN. The "Missing Dollar" of 3804 Turns Up, Much to the Sorrow of an Vrliana Mer­ chant. URBANA, Ohio, Dec. 5.—But three dol­ lars of the coinage of 1804 are known to be in existence. Two are accounted for and the other one is missing. The value of this missing coin according to the last numismatic circular is $800. A stranger arrived in town, put up at a leading hotel, and after a few days' visit got hard up. He had the missing dollar of 1804 and was willing to part with it at a sacrifice. A merchant gave him $100 for it and then sent to the treasury depart­ ment at Washington. The officials there discovered what the purchaser here hadn't—that the dollar had been coined in 1801 and the date altered. There i3 a moral in this bit of news that need not be given. What Herr Most Thinks. NEW YORK, Dec. 5.—Johann Most, the anarchist, has prepared a long address to the public in regard to his late trial and conviction. He says as soon as the Chi­ cago anarchists were executed the capi­ talistic press turned on him for a victim, and asserts that he has been very careful about talking and writing since his last imprisonment that false statements were made regarding his speeches, and bogus interviews published. Dakota Farm Statistics. OP.DWAY, Dec. .—The November re­ port of Statistician Sheridan gives some readable matter for those interested in Dakota farming.

DES MOINES, Iowa, Dec. 5.—Stato Auditor Lyons has cautioned the public against Col. Bryant, of Atlantic, who has harvested a big lot of notes in Guthrie county, under the cloak of a traveling lecturer for tho Knights of Labor. IIo is working a novel insurance scheme. Ho calls himself the president and mana­ ger and the organization tho "Univer­ sal Library association." Among farmers he guarantees to furnish a mar­ ket for their butter and eggs at 30 cents per pound, to enable them to secure their groceries at wholesale, provided they will become members. The scheme is to have a life insurance attachment, calling for §2,000 upon the death of husband or wife. This modern millenium is to be §15 mem­ bership fees. 

VENEZUELAN BOUNDARY. Citizens of the South American Republic Much Worked Up Over Encroachments of Neighboring English Colonists—-Tho United States Should Protect Their Moiitoo Doctrine. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—Mail advices to this city from Venezuela say: The news that a party of English colonists has landed on an island at the mouth of the Orinoco for the purpose of founding a settlement there, and that the Venezue­ lan government is opposing them, lias added fresh interest to a question in which the United States government has been desired to take part. The dispute about the British Guiana boundary line antedates the independ­ ence of Venezuela, and is an inheritance from the Spanish and Dutch naval pos­ sessions in that region. The Orinoco is likely to bo an important highway of commerce. Communicating through its branches with all parts of Venezuela, it not only becomes the chief commercial waterway for the republic, but lias an important strategetic value for the de­ fense of the country. The chief river of British Guinna is the Essequibo. Forty miles west of this, toward the Orinoco, is the Pome roon. The exact line between Brit­ ish Guiana and Venezuela was never exactly determined. The Venezuelans claim that the Essequibo was the limit, but this claim never would be admitted, since the Dutch, from whom the British derived their title, are known to have at times occupied a portion of the region west of that river. Venezuela would be glad if she could establish the Pomeroon as the boundary, but Great Britain long ago went far beyond even that stream, and has gradually extended her colonial domain by occupation until she has readied the mouth of the Orinoco. The great river empties through a delta which begins to form more than a hundred miles from the sea, and several of its mouths are navigable but the chief one is close to British Guiana, and by occupying its right bank and establishing themselves on the neighboring islands, the English colony hopes to secure substantial control of the great river. ****$ The latest move of Venezuela has been to dispatch to Europe Gen. Guzman Blanco, who had resigned the presidency for the purpose, to see if it is not possible to submit the dispute to suitable arbitra­ tion. Three years ago Gen. Blanco went on a similar errand, and supposed that he had procured the assent of the British foreign office to that mode of settlement. But so far from practically acceding to it the British colonists have since steadily ad­ vanced westward, being stimulated in part by the discoveries of gold in the dis­ puted region. This conduct caused the severance of diplomatic intercourse be­ tween Caracas arid London about nine months ago. The British insist that Venezuela has never practically main­ tained, nor until recent years even set up her present claim. Venezuela declares that it is only within the last quarter of a century that her government has been sufficiently stable and tranquil to consider the bound­ ary question. It has been urged that the spirit of tho Monroe doctrine would justify and per­ haps even require the interference of our government in this dispute and Venez­ uelans, looking at the menacing situa­ tion of Trinidad island, west of the Orin­ oco, and at the encroachments of British Guiana at its mouth, insist that Great Britain is taking steps to menace the in­ dependence of the country. 

IOWA TEMPERANCE. Catholics Organizing a State Temperance Association. DruL'QX'E, Dec. 5.—An important meet­ ing was held here Sunday in the Catholic cathedral for the purpose of organizing a State Catholic Temperance association. The clergy of the diocese have manifested great interest in the success of the project, and as the principal Catholic associations of the city have espoused the movement the new organization will have a very large mem­ bership from the start.

A BATTLE BETWEEN REVENUE OJT IMCERS AND MOONSHINERS. The Outlaws Routed After One of Their Number Is Mortally Wounded—R«ve nue Officers to Return to the Attack With Reinforcements. CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Dec. 5.—A num­ ber of revenue officers raided Sand Moun­ tain Friday in search of an illicit distilery, which they found and destroyed. They then hid themselves in the bushes and watched for their game. In due time ten moonshiuers made their appearance, and as soon as they saw tho revenue officers they opened fire on them with double barrelled shotguns. The officers re­ turned the fire and for teu min­ utes a terrible battle was waged from behind trees and rocks. After the moonshiners had used up all their ammunition they left the Held, but 0119 of their number was carried off mortally wounded. The revenue officers will again raid tlie mountain, hoping to capture the whole party. They have gone to Collins ville jor reinforcements. A DESPERATE RED.

LEESBURO, Fla., Dec. 8.—In South Florida are hundreds of deep circular holes called "sinks," and varying from 100 to 1,000 feet iu circumference, and from a depth of 100 feet to unmeasured depths, the latter generally filled with water. Oscar Schogrene, living at South lake weir, built his house on tho edge of ono of these sinks which was muddy and not over fifty feet deep. While the family were eating sup­ per the bottom of the sink dropped out of sight, engulfing tons of earth and a por­ tion of his house, with two women who were in the kitchen. Instant search was made by the neighbors, but tho bodies had completely disappeared, and also the debris of the house. Water now fills the sink, but the bottom can not be touched. THETRANSCONTI MENTALS An Agreement at Last Reached by Rail­ way Oflicials in Session at Chicago Pacific Mail to Receive 805,000 per Month Subsidy—Tho Canadian Pacific Allowed to Cut Rates Advanco in Freights East—Other Railway Matters. CHICAGO, Dec. 3.—The Transcontinen­ tal officials have succeeded in agreeing upon the formation of an association. The headquarters are fixed at Denver, and J. S. Leeds, now general freight agent of the Atchison road, will be chair­ man. The Pacific Mail Steamship com­ pany is to receive a monthly subsidy equal to £65,000, but it is not yet settled how it will be paid. Arrangements have been made with the Canadian Pacific whereby it will bo allowed to charge a less rate ou traffic to San Francisco, and will interchange business at Portland with tho Northern and Union Pacific. First-class freight will be advanced from New York from $3 to $4 per 100, and other rates in proportion. Tlie new ar­ rangement will probably begin Jam 1. ENFORCING AN ORDER. The Railway Comiuisssonei-s Take Steps to Compel tho N. P. and Manitoba Lines to Reduce Their Rates. ST. PAUL, Dec. 3.—At a meeting held on Nov. 10 the railway commissioners formulated an order to the Northern Pa­ cific and Manitoba railroads to the effect that they must make a charge of not more than 3 cents on a mile passenger tariff on their lines within the state. The railroads did not reduce their rates to the level ordered, and did not file any appeal within tlie ten days allowed by law, so that Thursday the commission, through its secretary, Mr. Warner, served upon the general managers of the two roads a notice that the rule must go into effect, and that it would see that the requisite notices were posted at all sta­ tions in the state upon the lines of the road. Grant Duluth Loiver Rates. ST. PAUL, Dec. 3.—A committee of Du­ luth citizens met with the representatives of the Northwestern roads. The com­ mittee desired to obtain the same freight rates to Duluth as to St. Paul, but this proposition the railroad men would not consider at all. A compromise was finally effected whereby a reduction of 10 cents per 100 pounds on the higher classes, down to cents on the lower classes, on present rates, will be granted. The Garretts Are Strong Yet.

'^r Iw*'1 "i GROVER'S MESSAGE. THE DOCUMENT PREDICTED TO BE AN UNUSUALLY LONG ONE. Secretary Bayard's Department to Absorb the Lion's Share—Cleveland Very Cau­ tious Regarding tho Tar ill'—Prophesies of the Contents. NEW YORK, Dec. 3.—A Washington special to the Tribune says: The presi­ dent, at the meeting of the cabinet Thursday, submitted tho rough draft of his forthcoming annual message to con­ gress. It was fully and freely discussed for nearly four hours, and will again be submitted to the cabinet in the form in which it is to bo sent to congress. Meanwhilo speculation is rife as to the contents of what will probably bo one of the longest official documents ever writ­ ten by Mr. Cleveland. Those who know say that it will contain approximately 22,000 words. From ex­ cellent sources it is ascertained that Mr. Bayard's department will absorb tlie lion's share of tho president's message. It indicates that the negotiation of a new treaty has been found impracticable, a result said to bo favored by Mr. Bayard. What the president will probably be able to say in his message is that the commis­ sion has agreed upon an interpretation of the treaty of 1818. A revision of the naturalization laws, the establishment of a central bureau for the registration of all naturalized citizens, and a hint as to the advisability of re­ stricting by federal statute immigration of an undesirable kind are among the topics discussed by tlie president. Regarding the tariff and other ques­ tions of finance tho president will have little to say, the present plan being, it is said, to let the secretary of the treasury deal with both questions in extenso in his annual report. In a general and very guarded way tho president recommends, it is understood, a liberal en­ largement of the free list, mentioning, however, by namo none of tlie articles which in his opinion ought to be placed there. A codification of the banking laws amended in the man­ ner proposed by the comptroller of the currency is recommended. The president,it is thought* will recom­ mend a liberal system of appropriations for the improvement of the Mississippi river. The repeal of the pre-emption and tim­ ber culture acts is urged in the strongest terms. The necessity of preserving the national forest is also pointed out. 

NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION Chances Very Strong That Chicago Will Again Capture tho Prize. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—The fight over the location of tho Republican national convention has practically begun. Parties are arriving from nearly all cities where the convention is in demand. It looks now as though it would probably go West, as Chicago has the prestige of the former conventions and great accommodations. It is evident that between the five West­ ern cities claiming it, Chicago has more supporters thus far than any one of the others. Should the contest lie between Chicago and all the other cities in tho West, they may pool their strength and may decide it in favor of one of the num­ ber. Philadelphia is also making a strong fight, and claims the next place to Chicago on the list. PLEURO-PNEL'MONIA. Its Complete Eradication Hoped for by the Commissioner of Agriculture. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—In his annual report the commissioner of agriculture says: The bureau of animal industry has inspected 15,386 herds of cattle, contain­ ing 117,480 head, supposed to be afflicted with pleuro pneumonia, and found 798 herds, with 10,7GG animals infected as to 2,235 head. Of 2,873 head inspected in addition, in the Chicago dis­ tilleries, nearly half were diseased. Never before was the disease restricted within so small an area as at the present, and conditions are favorable for its com­ plete eradication by the end of the next fiscal year. National Banks. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—The twenty-firth annual report of the comptroller of the currency, now in print, will be presented to congress on the first day of the session. The report shows that the total number of national banks organized up to the 31st of October is 3,802 of which 025 have gone into voluntary liquidation and 1:9 have failed. COMMENCE THE CAMPAIGN. Chicaco Republicans En Route to Wash­ ington to Interview the National Com­ mittee. CHICAGO, Dec. 2.—The departure of Mayor Roche and Col. George R. Davis for Washington is a decisive and per­ emptory indication of the fact that the Republican presidential campaign in Illi­ nois may be virtually said, in view of this step, to have already com­ menced. The editors of the leading Re­ publican journals of this city will be present during the more important ses­ sions of the conference to be held in Washington, and will probably leave in a day or two with the other members of the Chicago committee. W. F. Leland, Fred W. Peck, Graeme Stewart, "Long" Jones and many other prominent and representative Republicans will also ac­ company the party. Parker Desires to Meet the Committee. NEW 

YORK, NOV. 2.—Rev. Dr. Joseph Parker has reached this city from Chi­ cago. Before his arrival the president of the Beecher statue fund committee re­ ceived a telegram from Dr. Parker re­ questing that a meeting of the commit­ tee be called for Thursday, at which he would be present. He did not state why he desired to meet the committee. Maj. Pond thinks the doctor will preach in Plymouth church next Sunday. He will sail for England on Dec. 15. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—A call for a caucus of Democratic members of the house of representatives to meet Satur­ day evening, for the purpose of nomi­ nating officers of the house to be elected Monday, has been authoritatively pub­ lished. It seems to be generally under­ stood among the Democrats that S. S. Cox, of New York, is to be elccted per­ manent chairman of the caucus. 1 1 -i. ""r b»» ^^ryf, *••,« ,, jv -,1 1 BECOMINU VERY SERIOUS. Tlio Calumet and Hecla Mine Fire In «'reasiii£—Talk of Flooding tho Mine. ISKPEMING, Mich., Dec. 3.—The fire in the Calumet and Hecla copper mine id much worse. AH the shafts but three have been closed down, and the smoke is coming through the crevices at the mouth of tho shafts. Steam and gas are being sent down tho four shafts. The tempera­ ture is rising. Tho flames aro gaining ground in the mine. The exact condi­ tion of the mine is impassible to ascer­ tain, but it is certainly very bad. Thero is talk of flooding tho mine with water, bat this will not bo done until all other measures fail. WHEAT MOVEMENT. Receipts at Minneapolis and Duluth. for Three Months Equal to One-half the Entire Receipts Last Season—A Much Larger Supply Needed This Year Than Last to Keep Mills Running. MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 3.—The Market Record says: From Sept. 1 tho crop move­ ment of wheat at Minneapolis shows re­ ceipts amounting to 20,044,055 bushels. Duluth has in the same time received 8,760,139 bushels, making for the two places 28,804,189 bushels for less than three months. The total receipts of both places for the whole preceding crop year, Aug. 1 to July 31 inclu­ sive, were 59,734,925 bushels. Adding to the receipts of this season the proba­ ble arrivals for the next two days at Min­ neapolis and Duluth and the result wiJi show that one-half as much wheat has arrived in these two places from this cropjn three months as came from the preceding eroj) in the twelve months. There is now in Minneapolis approxi­ mately 6,500,000 bushels. The mills aro now, owing to low water, grinding about 21,000 barrels, which will bo about maximum for the winter. Now thero are going out on an average seventy-five cars daily to outside mills and to mixing houses, the demand for which is expected to continue fully as brisk through the winter. At that rate wo would, by allowing forty-five cars a day to go to Duluth, use up our average daily allowance for tlie remainder of tho year and open the spring season with no wheat in stock and an average of 80,000 bushels a day to arrive. That would be equivalent to stock for some 18,000 bar­ rels of flour daily, or at least 7,000 bar­ rels below natural requirements. To sup­ ply city and country mills for the season will call for more wheat than a year ago, and if the wheat is not in the country some of the ordinary wants cannot bo met. AN EXTRA SESSION. The Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. Will Convene the Legislature Jan. 10. WINNIPEG,- Dec. 3. —The lieutenant governor has been requested by tho cabi­ net minister to summon the Manitoba legislature for, the dispatch of business between Jan. 10 and 16.

Hon. Dr. Harrison, min­ ister of agriculture, and La Rieviere, pro­ vincial treasurer, have left for Ottawa to consult with Sir John Macdonald, and, it is said, to secure the shelving of Norquay. A crisis in Manitoba politics is immi­ nent. Blown Into the Air. DODGEVILLE, Wis., Dec. 3.—Four men were hurt, one of them fatally, and others severely shocked and bruised by an ex­ plosion near the Boltz mill. The men were working in a cut.. A small rock dropped into a blasting hole containing seven kegs of powder and in trying to dislodge it with an iron bar the powder exploded. The men at the blast were blown high into the air, but not seriously hurt, while those in the cut were buried beneath a mass of rocks and dirt. Fiske to Succeed Cleveland. OSUKOSH, Wis., Dec. 3.—B.
