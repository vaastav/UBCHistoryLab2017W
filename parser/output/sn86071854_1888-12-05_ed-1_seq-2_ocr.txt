A accond glance at the President's message will Inspire the Democrstl ?, willi a fi-fling of t .millern e in tbe strength ol the Issue of taxation as Mi Cleveland pot., lt, and cannot hm < d vince tbe urptv Jodtccd mind that tbe ' periy thoogb defeated)? still post* sound Democratic principles lhat must ls tbs end triumph But the message gon into the heart of the difficulty In our present system of high protection, aad ahowa that lt is a policy of class leg Illation thst mutt cause a chasm be tween thewotking clas.es and tbe eapi tsiisif. by pretending to protect tbe form er when lt put" them absolutely at thi mercy of the monopolists Many of the critics on the message ?.bink that such a document put fottb three bears sgo would h_ve "educated" tbe people to tbe tiutb, and resulted ia Democratlr victory. The vote was so close that, considering tbe three great disdvaatages we were un? der?the Southern question, the U9e of money or. tbe other side and lack of time to lnairuct?the truth ls that the Repub? licans hsve such a victory that it may be easily lost If they do not modify their high-protection policy, and that very mn. terially. The dauntless position of tho Presi? dent proclaims that vjpreme confidence in tbe right that makes people recognize a man who could sacrifice himself to a cause, and while the years go on thc Ameiican intelligence catches bold on that limple but powerful Idea of protect? ing thc masses of the people agains, tsxei to favor classes, we may be sure that tbe Democratic party will repeat tha set which it has performed so roany time* in tbe last twenty years of lt* long pat ri - otic stru_gle and rise from tbe ground stronger by the lesson of defeat THK 

SOUTH AGAIN. The It'orW baa done a splendid piece of petriotlc terrica In collecting inter vlewi with representative negroes all over the South, and thereby proving con? clusively tbat there has been no interfer' ence with their rights aa voters anl no pretense of snob a thing, except at Rich mond, Va , Greenville, S C , and Hain more. In all other sections of the .South the negroes say that they are not re? stricted in their rights as titi.ens They ere ssttihed with the existing order of things. They Bak oo interference upon the part of tbe Inccmlag administration They ere, as a rule, content with what bsa been accorded tl. in, and their teat!" mosy ls, In the main, highly compliment ory to tbe white people of tba South. Wa know" how much there ls in the pretense of chesting voters at Richmond, and infer that there ia equally little at tbe other point, named. Tbe toting In tbe South ls as fair as in any other part of the countryi and the whole theory of Ingall* and other Republicans tbat the negroes are Intimidated is all bush, so far as truth la concerned. Bo far aa politics la concerned it ia a fabric of Republican policy to carts!-1 the representstion of ibo Southern Ststei Tbere is not one-tenth the amount of cheating <>r intimidation In the South ti? to the North, snd aa for the "great problem" between the races tbe jua lice of the qnestion lies right iu the core of our principles of fiee gov srnment. If the Statis are to exist un? der tbe Constitution and bave local governments they most hsve some rights, snd among them is to hold elections and osrtlfy tbe representative-. If elections are to bs controlled by the Federal judges tbs next thing would be Federal bayo nets and provost marshall. Thc logical seqoence la Inevitable, for whether the R.publicsna were black, or white, or speckled, or striped, of course under tbe plsn of Federsl onfroi the party in power would virtually do the counting in ' their own wey assured of protection hy? the Government, or lather ibe usurpen It ii proved that the original theory of tbe autonomy of the Stales In the tulon la not dlaturbed by the abrogation of I tbs rlgnt to secode that waa settled by tbs civil wsr. Kow, what we wish to ssy to every Northern men la that when s great aud powerful party gets entire possession of the Government, snd pro ossds to set up a aystem of Federal con- f trol of elections In soy Southern State, snd tbe thing ls allowed by the popular voice, tbe pretence of protecting voters in their rigbti msy bc tberesfier used In soy Stats North ai well aa Sooth. Tbe "race problem li no problem ai nil if tbe Republican party will leave the. Southern States to the same enjoyment: of freedom under the Constitution tbat Hortbern ** latta en Joy Tba World"* extensive resssrebes show thst tha Republican theory is a new piece of political trickery to exouse opening Ibo gates of the States or rather tesriog thens dows sod overriding the instils tills with a view to fortifying a party ti power hy jockeying tbe vote of eight Of ttl Ststes.
