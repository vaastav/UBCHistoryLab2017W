•J,-. SS-' 8 W i* -y Washington, D. C:, Dec. §.• Declaration of war with Austria Hungary was recommended to congress yesterday by President Wilson in his formal message. Before his address was half completed leaders in the house and senate announced that the formal declaration will be passed by both houses by Friday night.

VASSAL OF GERMANY. Immediate war against Aus tria, even though she be only Germany's -vassal and not her own mistress, the president de clared, is necessary because the central powers must be consid ered as one and because the war can be conducted successfully in no other way. divine a plain warning, now iw v,A TTTrmlrl hesitate I ever, that he wouldnot ^not nesnxaws to ask for declaration of war on Turkey and Bulgaria when he considered it necessary, the pres ]ident said: /J ««We shall go wherever the ne cessities of this war carry us, but it seems to be that we should only go where immediate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others.

PRICE OF PEACE. Peace, the president told congress can come only when the Prussian tnilitaiy autocracy is beaten down 'when the German people make peace •with the world through rulers the world can trust, when they make reparation for the wrongs the present rulers have done and when the en I slaved people of Belgium and nortli |ern France and the Balkans have I teen set free. Germany's declaration that she is fighting a war of self defense against deliberate aggression, the president declared "wantonly false" and he re iterated anew that no one is threaten tog the existence of the independence or the peaceful enterprises of Ger many. 

REBUKE FOR ^AC,F,ST® Of those who speak of peace without "the overthrow of German military autocracy, the president declared. "I hear men debate peace who un derstand neither its nature nor the way in which we may 'attain it, witn1 uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits. justice done at every point and to But I know that none of these speaks the nation. They do jiot touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten." mente, the president declared the United States became Germany's en emy only when she started out to dominate the world by force of arms.

POISON IN RUSSIA. The developments in Russia the president dismissed in a few words: "The Russian people have been poisoned by the very same dark falsehoods," he said, "that have kept the German people in the dark, and Our object, of course, is to win the war, and we shall not slacken or suf fer ourselves to be diverted until it is won.

ENEMY'S WRONGS ODIOUS. "I shall not go back to debate the in the modern world. causes of the war. The intolerable wrongs done and planned against us by the sinister masters of Germany have long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true American to need to be rehearsed.

WHEN PEACE COMES. But the fact that a wrong use,has been made of a just idea is no reason why a right use should not be made-of it.

It is no affair of ours what they do with their for the people of the Turkish empire the right and opportunity to make their own lives safe, their own for tunes secure against oppression or in justice and from the dictation of foreign courts or parties. "And our attitude and purpose with regard to Germany herself are of a like kind. We intend no wrong against the German empire, no inter- ference with her internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the oth«r absolutely unjustifiable, abso lutely contrary to the principles we have professed to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a nation.

"From every point of view, there fore, it has seemed to be my duty to speak, these declarations of purpose, to add these specific interpretations to what I took the liberty of saying to the senate in January. Our en trance into the war has not altered our attitude towards the settlement that must come when it is over. "When I said in January that the nations of the world were entitled not only to free pathways, upon the sea, but also to assured and unmolested access to those pathways, I was think ing, and I am thinking now, not of the smaller and weaker nations alone, which need bur counsel and support, but also of the great and powerful nations and of our present enemies as well -as our present associates in the war.

We are seeking permanent, not temporary foundations for the peace of the world and must seek them candidly and fearlessly. As always the right will prove to be the expedient. "What shall we do. then, to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all impediments to success and we must make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a fighting unit. URGES WAR ON AUSTRIA. "One very embarrassing obstacle that stands in our way is that we are at war with Germany but not' with her allies. "I, therefore, very earnestly recom mend that the congress immediately declare the United States in a state of war with Austria-Hungary. "Austria-Hungary is* for the time being not her own mistress but simply the vassal of the German government. We must face the facts as they are and act upon them without sentiment ip this stern business. The govera ment of Austria-Hungary is not act- ing upon its own initiative or in re sponse to the wishes and feelings of its own peoples but as the instrument of another nation. "We must meet its force with our own and regard the central powers as but one. The war can be success fully conducted in no other way. mlt to deceive them and to act as their! a declaration of war against Turkey masters that they are fighting for the! and Bulgaria.

RE8ULT OF AUTOCRACY. "German rulers have been able to upset the peace of the world only be cause the German people were not suffered under their tutlege to share the comradeship of the other peoples of the world, either in thought or in purpose.

PROFITEERING MUST STOP. "Recent experiences have convinced me that the congress must go further in authorizing the government to set limits to prices. The law of supply and demand, I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the law of unrestrain ed selfishness. While we have elimi- 0 made plain single committee, in order that respon sibility may be centered, expenditures standardized and made uniform and waste and duplication as much as pos sible avoided.

"If I have overlooked anything that ought to be done for the more effec tive conduct of the war, your own counsels will supply the omission. What I am perfectly clear about is that in the present session of the congress our whole atteition and energy should be concentrated on the vigorous and rapid and successful prosecution of the great task of winning the war. WAR OF 

HIGH PRINCIPLE. "We can do this with all the greater zeal and enthusiasm because we know that for us this is a war of high prin ciple, debased by no selfish motive of conquest or spoliation because we know, and all the world knows, that we have been forced into.it to save the very institutions we live under from corruption and destruction. "The purposes of the central pow ers strike straight at the very heart of everything we believe in their meth ods of warfare outrage every principle of humanity and of knightly honor their intrigue has corrupted the very thought and spirit of many of our peo ple their Minister and secret diplo macy has sought to take our very ter ritory away from us and disrupt the union of the states. Our safety would be at an end, our honor forever sullied and brought into contempt were we to permit their triumph. They are strik ing at the very existence of democracy and liberty. BATTLE TO END. "It is because it is for us a war of high, disinterested purpose, in which all the free peoples of the world are banded together for the vindication of right, a war for the preservation of our nation and of all that it has held dear of principle and of purpose, that we feel ourselves doubly constrained to propose for its outcome only that which is righteous and of irreproach able intention, for our foes as well as for our friends. The cause being just and •holy, the settlement must be of like motive, and quality. For this we can fight, but for nothing less noble or less worthy of our tractions) For this cause we entered the war and for this cause will we battle until the last gun is fired. EYES OF WORLD ON U. S. "I have spoken plainly because this seems to me the time when it is most necessary to speak plainly, in order that all the world may know that even in the heat and ardor of the struggle and when our whole thought is of carrying the war through to its end, we have not forgotten any ideal or principle for which the name of America has been held in honor among the nations and for which it has been our glory to contend in the great gen erations that went before us. "A supreme moment of history has come. The eyes of the people have been opened and they see. The hand of God is laid upon the nations. He will show them favor, I devoutly be lieve, only if they riBe to the clear heights of His own justice and mercy." SUPREME WAR BOARDFAVORED CONGRESS WILL GET BILL PRO POSING COUNCIL OF THREE MEN.
