JUDGE ARCHBALD IS ARRAIGNED FOR Representative Clayton, Pre senting Case of Lower House, Charges Defendant with Prostitution of Position, TRIAL CENTERS ABOUT COAL DUMP PURCHASE Counsel, in Reply, Asserts That Facts, When Fully Present ed, Will Entirely Vindicate His Client of Crime, (By Meriting Journal Special l.ennl Wire.) Washington. Dec. A. Judge Kobert V. Archbald of the I'nitcd suites com merce court sat before the bar of the senate today and heard himself re ferred to as one who hud "prostituted his official position to personal profit," who hud "commercialized his poten tiality as a judge," and who had "de graded his office and destroyed the confidence -of the public in his integ rity." To this arraignment by Rep resentative Clayton of Alabama,- rep resenting the house of representatives in the impeachment proceedings against the jurist, Judge Archibald's chief counsel, A. S. Wortnington, made au emphatic reply. He declared the house had brought proceedings against Judge Archbald upon tacts that, if properly analyzed, showed the Jurist's motives to be unquestionable. "1 do not like to think that any man can be brought Into a court of justice unywhere and nuide to answer charges so vague and indefinite," add ed Mr. Wortnington. Judge Archibald sut with his attor neys at the right of the bar. Repre sentative Clayton, making the open ing statement for the house, declared the facts shown in the investigation of Judge Archibald's business relations with coal companies and railroads showed that his "sense of morality" had been deadened; and that he had used his official position ,-to induce officials of railroads that were or might be litigants before his court, to grant him. lavors.oi to "consent to busi ness deals. Judge Archibald's attorney replied to all of the impeachment charges made by the house, declaring that the witnesses summoned in behalf of the accused Jurist would substantiate their claim that Mr. Archbald had been guilty of no wrong doing, and that his relations to certain coal land deals had been open. The first wit nesses will bo summoned before the senate court of impeachment tomor row. The trial is expected to center about the testimony of witnesses as to Judge Archbald's connection with the purchase or attempted purchase of certain refuse coal d urn lis.

Indianapolis, Dec. 3. Letters written by Frank M, Ryan, president of the International Association or Bridge and Structural Iron Workers, were read in connection with dates of ex plosions in the cross-examination of Ityan by the government at the "dyna mite conspiracy" trial today. Hyan testified that his knowledge of numerous explosions which had oc curred after he had written a letter from New York, was gained entirely through newspaper uccocnts. He said newspaper account . 0t explosions on non-union Jobs often were enclosed in letters as news. Kxtract from the New York letter which Hyan testi fied he wrote, tin April 27. 1910. as bend of the union, to Secretary John J. McNamaru, and the explosions which the government cited as hav ing occurred later were correct. ."Let l.egleitner take care of the jobs in bis district." . Heurv W. Deglcitner was then sta tioned at Pittsburgh. An explosion occurred at McKoe's Hocks, near Pittsburgh, In July, 1910. "Let iiockln arrange for Cleveland, Cincinnati and Detroit jobs." Herbert S. Iiockln is charged with being leader of the "dynamiting" crew. An explosion occurred at Cleveland June 22d, that year. "Davenport, Iowa, and Peoria, can be handled by Iiockln. Explosions occurred at Davenport and Peoria on June 4th. "What did you mean when you said: 'l.egleltiier and Iiockln Make care of these Jobs?" .asked District Attorney Miller., "I meant for them to tise every legitimate means to have union men put to work," unswered Hyan. Uet'ore an explosion on a bridge at Dayton, Ohio, which Edward Clark, union official at Cincinnati, confessed to having caused, Hyan said he sent Hockin to Cincinnati. Clark, in his confession, said Hockin furnished him with the dynamite for the explosion. Hyan asserted he gave no instructions to' Hockin about dynamite. "How soon after an explosion on u bridge in Cincinnati in May, 1909, did Clark call you up?" Hyan was asked. "Possibly a few days, but he gave me no details about an explosion." Asserting that he had no intention thut violence should be used. Hyan said, through a request from W. licit Hrown, a union business agent, he sent Hockin to Kansas City prior to an explosion on a bridge there In Au gust, 1910. In explaining a letter to Michael J. Cunnane, business agent at Philadel phia, giving instructions to handle a l non-union job in any way mat win delay or add to llie cost or u, ityan said his only purpose was to have union men taken off other Jobs in construction by the same contractor. The government read a letter written from Dallas In 1910 to McNamaru by Philip A. Cooley, New Orleans, who Is charged with having urged that ex plosions take place in the south: "1 agree with you to postpone the prop osition so I can get some pointer.';, from you and there will be no after effects." "Did you receive letters from Cooley about arrangements to blow up lobs'."' asked Mr. Miller. "I never received a letter from Cooley about blowing up anything," answered Hyan. Asked what was meant when prank C. Webb, New York, wrote him: "Your confidence in me you may never fear, for I don't believe In talk ing too much in cases of this kind." Hyan said It only referred to ar rangements for unionizing jobs In New York. Hyan admitted he had ac knowledged the receipt of a newspa per clipping from John (' 1 l'n, pres ident of the I'nitcd Textile "-'inkers of America, about an exploslo.i on a bridge at Pall Hiver. Mass.. In "'OS, and na, replied he "read the .-"p- plng with interest." He said the iron workers' union furnished $10,000 bond for George C'Donnell. who was accused of the iH intuiting, and that the union also paid o'Donucll money after he had beer: convicted. -We sent him about 11.000 because we considered he was being perse cuter!." said Hya!). "Did von ever make an Investiga tion of the I, os Angeles Times explo sion, in which twenty-one persons were murdered?" asked Mr. Miller. "Yts. I tried to find out how it hap pened." "And yet you re-elected J. J. Me Numara as secretary of the union after he was arrested?" "Yes." "And veil had Hockin as secretary until yesterday"" "Yes."

A note of warning to ICuropean powers which by Indirect means con tinue to discriminate, against Ameri can Hade; a strong appeal to the con gress to uplift the great foreign poli cies of America above mere itueHtlona of partisanship; a triumphant vindi cation of the diplomacy ut this admin istration, which Is characterized as that of "dollars versus bullets;" a master ful nrldo In the enormous expansion of American trade as a result of thu foreign policies of his administration ; and au earnest appeal fi r Joint action bv congress ami tne executive m open new markets lor Amerlc.Mii Industries these are the more slrlklug feu- lurea of president Taft s fourth annual message sent tu congress today. 'nt... ..,uutf iu iii,i rtt'si of a series of such communication which he wilt make to congress in tne euriy nays oi the. sosslun, and deals entirely with the foreign relations of the I'nitcd State. Heglunlng with the usual reference lu the existing good relutlolm with for etgn powers, the president udds that these have been strengthened by "A greater Insistenco upon JUMtlce to American citizens, or liiten-sls, wher ever It may have been denied, and stronger emphasis of the ned of mu tuality In comniereiul and oilier re lations." For the firt time in Its history. says the president, the st-tn depart ment has obtained subntnntlally the most, ravored nation irsmmeni inuu ,iii ,.r it... eouiitriew or the world. Therefore, he says that It Is only nat ural that competitive countries should view with some concern the rxpensloii of our commerce. Hence the warning. "If In some Instances, tne measure takn ''y them to meet It are not en tirely equitable, a remedy should be found." To this end, the president strongly recommends the enactment of the bill recommended bv Secretary Knox last hecember, permitting the government Instead of Imposing the full maximum rales of duty against discriminating countries, to apply a graduated acalo of duties, up to that maximum of 'in per cent. "Kbit tariffs at t of date, says ,i. ...a. i..,, i "v,,iionu no lonuer ac cord coual tariff treatment In all oth er nations, irrespactive oi inu uci- iiienl from Ibein r Ivcd. i. i.. ........ miixru Hull the American government should be c,iilpped with weapons id negotiation aim ",iri to modern economic conditions." The stale department, "an archalo and Inadeituate machine," at the be ginning of this administration, inn president an vs. has become a new or ganlcatloti, with highly specialized bu reaus and experts dealing witn ev y phase of American Hade and diplo macy. Holding that the cssenco of this ' reorganized service Is found In the merit system, which President Cleveland Is credited with having in troduced, President Tuft makes A. strong appeal to congress to make thla machine pennaneiil, by giving tn force of statutory law to the executive ciders governing admission to and pro motion In the dlploiuailc and couaular st-r. Ices. To show that these appointment ar already largely non-partisan, the presi dent points to the fact that thren or the present ambassadors are hold overs; that of the ten hit has appoint ed live were bv promotion from th rank of minister; that ft the thlrt ministers appointed, eleven were pro motions; and that In tho consular service no less than 55 P"r rent of th consuls appointed by him wer iron the southern slates. ' The diplomacy of the present nd ministration has sought to respond trf modern Ideas of commercial l"'''r conrse," says President Taft. "ThW pnllcv has been characterized sub slllutlng dollars for hullcts. It la ono thai apiiealH alike to Idealistic humani tarian Mentlmenls. to the dictated of sound policy and strategy, and to le gitimate commercial alms.'' The president adds that "because modern diplomacy Is commercial, there has been a. disposition in soma iiiarter to attribute to It none but materialistic aims." "How strikingly erroneous is mictl an impiession msy bo seen from study of the results by which tho di plomacy of the fnlted State can b Judged." savs the president. tie mentions the arbitration treaties with France and Great ltritaln, which, failed of confirmation In th senate: the successful tripartite mediation of the Argentina Republic Itrazll. and the I'nited States, between Peru anil I.
