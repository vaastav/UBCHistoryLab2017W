The Seneca Advertiser says that the Abolition pipers are presenting pyramid of States in astpuudiug cpk tls as the proud trophies rwt by the Abolition party ia the lae elections. Abolitionism is on tha rampage, and we are told that tfe Democratic party is hopelessly rained; that it will be though it Has cast a million and a half 9 Votes (185,000 in Ohio) in the Northern States hereafter knows fily among the things that were. It is useless to deny the the fact that wo have been defeated badly defeaj ted..: And were it the first time '.that disaster had befallen us aa a party; we might. 'give' way to repining, ; and feel that the country was lost and ruined. 1? at such is not the case, as the public history of the country already shows. In 1840, the democratic party, then in power, noniiaated for re-election to the presidency, Martin Van Buren. The' whig party,, then in a large mino rity, witksiit-an government patron Age or intense, nominated General Harrison!. ': All know the issue of the contest; the whigs were victorious and the democracy were routed "horse, foot and dragoons." We were then told that the days of the democratic party wore ended; that it could never recover froia its overwhelming defeat. What was thj result? In 1844, the whigs being ia power, nominated the gallant Clay, man well known throughout the country as a bold, fear less ad vocate of whig principles; in fact, wa4 frequently called "the great embo diment of whig principles." It was expected that the victory over the democratic party would be an easy one. The democracy nominated, after a tedious session', in convention, . as a compromise candidate, James K. Polk of Tennessee, "a man comparatively unknown outside of his own State! Who does not remember the the tanta lizing inquiry made in the columns of the whig pvess, "who ia James K. Polk?" All were sanguine of the suc cess of Mr. Clay, and the democrats had but little idea of the election of their ' candidate Mark the ..result! Despite the government influence brought to bear to secure the election of Mr. Clay, the democracy elected their candidate, ' .and again acquired the ascendancy. .-J '!.;; .. In' l?!? the 'democratic-party nom inated Geni Lewis Cass, a max well known - in history, a life-long .demo crat, and i9 such having the confidence of the entire party. The whigs nom inated Orca. Taylor, and by a very large majority elected him, and the doinocrats against lost their power. In 1852, the whigs nominated Gen. Scott, supposing that becausejaeneral Taylor was elected upon his. new pop ularity, it would be an easy matter to carry the . election of General Scott upon the same platform. Again the democracy were compelled to take an unknown man as a compromise candi d ite,..-and nominated Hop. Franklin Pierce".' In thisj contest the-; whigs were': hidry beaten. fJJut jwc jfolfpw thii train irjf thoiigfit no further, as we have served our . purpose in the elec tions already referred to. m.Tha demo cratic party have met dcfSiifter'de feat, disaster after disaster, yet though ofteadefeatei,' It .has nevef'been' 'cpni quered. 'Again we have suffered an overwhelming defeat at the' bands of the republican party, .r We stop not now o iquiVe as to the cause of that defeat; it js enough to Know tiiat .suco. is the jjase, but our inquiry now is, what'is the duty , of the democracy in the present ' emergency? ., We claim thatif our Country is to be extricated fremiti present embarrassed condition, and peace and prosperity be restored, it tnust be done through the success of democratie principles as held by the democratic part.

What then can the Democratic party do to avert such a calamity? if .. -ft If we reyine and murmur, and ui tlr tali ft 111 irmi Ira ikaAl ' pect a recurrence of the good oli times when we were a happy and uni- teI people;- Let the great dcrJ3crat;c party resolve that it will never rest until erccass shall ag-.jn be theirs.

It was a favorite ssying among the aucients: "The gods help those who help themselves." There is a good illustration of this principle in one of lEsop's fables. A, countryman, in crossing a stream, unfortunately was stalled. For a while he whipped his horses, hut all to no purpose. Finally becoming discouraged, he ceased his efforts and besought Hercules to come to his assistance.. The pod came, and in answer to the complaint said, "You fool, inetead of crying for help, get up and put your 6houlder to the wheel, akd try to get youi cart out." 'Let the' Democratic party Vuekle on their armor and prepare for the cams paign of 1864. Let every man feel that he is a host in himself, and that the responsibility of defeat or victory rests upon his own endeavors, and the tri umph of sound democratic principles will follow. ,'Tis true we have a stroDg opposition. lis true that the admin istration can command influences nev er at the disposal of any former one. 'Tis true that it has tools, in the shape of public, effieers, in amy state, coun ty and neighborhood, and these men hate the democratic party with a per fect hatred. Numbers of them are renegade democrats, who, for consid eration, have sold themselves to do the dirty work of the administration, and there is nothing too low or mean for these men. Tbey are unscrupulous, and will leave no stone unturned. Their great idea is the destruction of the democratie party. The administration has money and bayonets, and will not hesitate to use either or both in order io carry out their -designs.'" Notwithstanding all this, success is within the reach of the Democratic party. Let us "pick the flint and try it again." "One fire more and the day is ours." ; rIt will require earnest work from earnest men, and nothing but work will -insure success. It is useless to theorize, we need something practical, and wo now pro pose that immediately,un every; town ship inthe county, therebe athorough organization of the party, and that the leading men in every community iden tify themselves with such organizations, and interest themselves in Seeing that good, sound .democratic documents are circulated among the people. ; .We have a year yet in which to work, and in that length of time much can be accomplished.

In nine cases out of ten, tbese men tie hired or bought with a price lo be "loyal" and they generally chatter more i or less loudly according lo tbe price which At nighlfall tha ky cleared, and the .full they are paid.

From tho Alton Democrat. ' Forney. Among other no'ables recently gathered at Gettysburg, Fornpy came al-o; and being called upon, as persuaded to make a brie1 speech. We find this report of th. sub stance of his remaik: 'He chided his audience quite feverly for not giving Prrsident Lincoln a more entbu siastic reception of cheers and applause when, in answer to their serenade, he had appeared and spoken. Were they aware, he asked, that hey owe their homes, and tbat the poople all ojbw the North owe the safety of their homes,'!. Preeidenl Lincoln? He had also beon a Douglas Democrat, but he believed that Douglas died as the right time " The lat clause is especially wor'hy of no tiee. Forney thinks that Douglas "died at the rifiht time." In ibis he speaks tbe sen limonis of the whole Jacobin ptrty and three fourths of ihe recreant Democrat who have deserted their principle, and through fear or favor, gone over lo the enemy. II and they know full well that had Doug Ins lived, the war would have been confin ed to its original basis, and not suffered to degenerate into an Abolition crusade. They rejoice tbat he is under the sod, and the people, without a leader, given over to the devices of fanatics and fools, whose only am bi'ion is to destroy forever what our fathers buili up.
