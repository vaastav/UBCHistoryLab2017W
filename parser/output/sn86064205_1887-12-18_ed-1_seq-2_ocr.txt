will decide whether cr not Sul Ross was ahead of the times in his message The American party organized in 1886 sleeps in an unmarked grave Frank Pixley writes In mourning envelopes The cspitol dome and the Austin City secretaryship are settled but the Dis patch still has the Valley of Vapors When the press of Texas undertake to work up a boom for Texas it is useless for that boom to hod back it must come The report of Superintendent Kendall of the Texas Deaf and Dumb Asylum shows that that institution is a credit to the state The state of Virginia is beginning to assume an air of oldtime decency and respectability With Daniels and Bar bour in the Senate people will be disposed to forgive her for some of her former statesmen The editor of the Cuthbert Ga Broad axe advertised for a boy and the paper was hardly oft the press when his wife presented him with a pair of lusty twins He is still in doubt as to whether or not advertising pays Texas is five thousand dollars ahead on the Louisiana lottery of last month When about twentyfive or thirty thous and dollars sent in for tickets Is deducted from this sum it will become smaller than Falstsffs men in buckram When one of the California excursion ists learned that wheat could be raised in Texas he became skeptical when he was told that Texas raised sugar and cotton he became charitable and thought that his informant being in Texas must be a liar ExDoorkeeper Donelson is known to fame at present as the man who won 2000 on a marker and paid a fine which kept him out of the penitentiary It may be very interesting to learn

be created by the immigration move ment in the way of secretaryships clerk ships etc to fold their wings and return to the forests primeval They will be called upon when ne ded The national reputation of exSenator Maxey would direct national attention to a movement inaugurated at a meeting of which he was chairman This Dalits meeting ought to be worked for all it is worth in behalf of the whole state of Texas and the national reputation of Mr Maxey alone entitles the suggestion of his name to serious consideration Do not think that because our new Congressional members have not been heard from that their speeches are not ready The delay is caused by the lack of an opportunity to Introduce them Everybody cannot be as fortunate as Congressman Poindexter Dunn of Ar kansas who worked in his maiden effort on the revision of the rules and made himself famous in Arkansas The treasury surplus said President Cleveland is extracted from the indus tries and necessities of the country Mr Cleveland would stop the accumulation of a surplus by putting an end to exactions on the industries and necessities of the country Mr Blaine would make tobacco cheaper and perpetuate a high price for woolen and iron goods Mr Cleveland is a Democrat Mr Blaine Is a Republi can The brilliant young preacher and labor agitator Rev Hugh O Pentecost has re signed his charge and will hereafter make his living in other pursuits He gives as his reason that his persecution resulting from his pity for the Chicago anarchists has changed that pity to sympathy and given him a distaste for the Christianity of the present Like the late Reverend McGiynn he has grown too large for his theological breeches The Blair educational bill has been fa vorably reported by the Senate committee on education This is carrying out the Hamiltonlan theory with a vengeance Some one should now propose a bill pro viding for a national religion a uniform method of breakfasting and a national style of trousers If the state is to gov ern and control the private affairs of the state and the individual we should have a law giving directions for building chickencoops also Pig Iron Kellys daughter has made her debut as

Governor Ross You have been cordially invited to attend the state im migration convention at Dallas on the 20th inst Your presence would add greatly to the power of the movement and would evince that patriotic devotion to the people of Texas displayed by you on the tented fields and the civic walks of life By all meansGovernor he with the MT i T wv if representatives of your great constituency when they meet to devise ways and means for the upbuilding of the common wealth The awful calamity occasioned by a river changing its course and overwhelm ing 7000 quare mile3 of densely popu lated agricultural lands in China should arouse the charity of benevolent people all over the world When this country was visited with afflictions the Chinese people responded promptly and liberally and it would be a graceful act on the part of Congress to appropriate a respectable sum for the purpose of ameliorating the suffering and relieving the widespread distress prevailing in the overflowed dis tricts Charity bestowed upon worthy objects is always a good investment The twentyfifth annual report of the Comptroller of the Currency shows that the total number of national banks in operation on October 31 was 3061 The total numberof new banks formed during the last year is 225 the total number closed during the year is thirtythree of whicn twentyfive went into voluntary liquidation and eight failed The gross increase in national bank capital during the year amounts to 36894775 There has been however a decrease of capital of 6322450 The net increase of capital for the year is therefore 30572325 On the other hand there is a net decrease of 50495590 in the circulation represented by bonds The people may see from this statement how great is the security of the national banking system That only eight banks out of a grand total of 3061 failed is a tribute of security at least which should be considered by those who are discussing the banking system of the country THE 

DALLAS MEETING The Dallas convention was called to considervways and means to promote the welfare of Texas people and Texas rail roads and to advance the interests of every section of the state Every man who goes to that convention should labor for the cooperation of people and rail roads and waive all sectional and local rivalries The watchword should be unity and cooperative effort to secure for the entire state low passenger rates and a sufficient sum of money to be equitably expended in advertising and working up immigration and capital to fully develop the resources peculiar to each division of the state CALIFORNIA TOURISTS The necessity of immigration is well known and the virtue of inducing tourists to visit the state as a means of correcting the erroneous impressions entertained abroad is becoming more and more man ifest daily A number of gentlemen from Michigan and points in the northwest who constitute a party of excursionists to California induced towards the Pacific slope by the low rates offered stopped over in Eort Worth and were surprised and delighted with what they found The rains had contributed liberally in furnish ing a carpet of mud to the streets and the gloominess of the day was discouraging but the excursionists were shrewd enough to see through all the untoward circumstances and discern the attractions of fhe city and country contiguous Many of the gentlemen spoken to admitted that Texas was grossly misrepresented and painfully mis understood abroad and that if her re sources were properly advertised and a low tourists rate made by the railroads that thousands of people would come here and find eligible investments It was indeed a pity and some of the excur sionists regretted that their trip had not been to Texis instead of California It is to be hoped that Texas shall soon be receiving carloads ef just such as those who were the citys guests yesterday for a brief stay SYMPTOMS OF DECAY The meeting of the Republican clubs in Chickering Hall New York and their puroose of forming a national league is one of the strongest evidences imagina ble that the Republican party is falling into decay and will soon be a thins of the past The most prominent men in the Republican party have entered heart ily into the new departure and while they protest that It is not an abandon ment of Republican principles but a fur therance of them and while the old is sues are the same or nearly similar it cannot be denied that the necessity for these clubs springs from a lack of faith in the old organization and that the clubs themselves are each crystalized protests against the Republican party The idea of a national party professing to espouse the principles and act as an auxiliary to another national party already thorough ly organized is too absurd It is the policy of the oriental chan cellor who finding the tax on hands greater than the people could pay divided the sum into ten equal parts and made it a tax upon fingers and thumbs n the hope that its payment would be simplified and rendered easy There are only a certain number of voters who will vote the Republican ticket Dividing these into two national parties cannot increase their number Just now there jfe0 T OUR BOOK TABLE Zr < W THE GAZETTE FOKT WOETH TEXAS SUNDAY DEOEMBEE 18 country sparing only such as have the blood of the Democratic lamb on their doorpost and they are prudently provid ing for themselves places of refuge It will be the easiest and simplest thing in the world to introduce and pass a resolu tion changing the new partys name from Republican Club to something more catchy and less reminiscent It can be done in a twinkling and a national party with a new name and a creed to be prescribed will be armed and ready for the fray It is undoubtedly the banshees cry for the Republican party in America RENDER UNTO CAESAR The value ofjncwapapers as factors in de veloping Btates and sections is forcibly Illus trated by the results obtained by the Fort Worth Gazette in regard 10 immigration to this state The Gazette took hold of a ques tion that had lain dormant for years and In a short time aroused the great stste of Texas to action The result Is ihat a meeting will be held at Dallas on the 20th to organize a state Immigration society and the probability is that nearly every county In the state will be repre sented The good that may result to the state by this organ i ration is not a matter of specula tion but too boundless to attempt an enumera tion Tbe Gazette Is solely responsible for the move and to it should the honor be given Ilillsboro Mirror While The Gazette is duly grateful for all appreciation of any of its efforts in behalf of Texas simple justice to another demands an explanation of the origin of the agitation that has so aroused the whole state of Texas now that this paper is ihus publicly accorded the sole credit When the contemplated formation of a Texas pool was announced in 1885 Mr John Howard then agent of the Bee Line wrote to The Gazette predicting the effect of such pool ontTexas immigra tion The Gazette printed Mr How ards letters and editorially besought the roads not to quarantine Texas by the destruction of competition Mr Howard sought in that year to interest certain other newspapers in the agitation but failed The effort in 1885 fell stillborn Mr Howard and The Gazette failed to impress and arouse the people and short ly afterwards he left the Bee Line and entered the service of the Mobile and Ohio but never ceased to urge the need of some action by the people of Texas During the past month the editor of The Gazette was m correspondence with an eastern gentleman who contem plated a visit to Texas and who inquired if there were not return tickets to Texas sold in eastern points as well as to Cali fornia The Gazette editor referred the inquiry to a Eort Worth ticket agent who said such tickets were sold in the east and the eastern gentleman was so informed He however replied by en closing a note to himself from a ticket agent in Bbston saying that no return tickets were sold to Texas and that the rate to Eort Worth was something over 40 The day after the receipt of this letter Mr Howard was in The Gazette sanctum during one of his periodical visits to the state and was in terrogated as to excursion tourists and other round trip tickets to Texas from outside points and the result of this in quiry was an editorial in The Gazette calling public attention to the discrimi nation in favor of California The people were impressed because they had been watching for months not only the Cali fornia craze but the depletion of Texas by Texas railroads with no corresponding inducement by the roads In behalf of Texas The movement has now attained state proportions and no town or newspaper or individual should seek to claim unde served credit John Howard who has done as much for the state as any man in Texas according to his means has been agitating thie question since 1885 when he and The Gazette so signally failed to arouse the people and while a chance correspond ence of The Gazette led to the inquiry concerning round trip tickets John How ard is really entitled to all the credit for the agitation that now promises to result in great good to the whole state Dallas is to be highly commended for its quick perception of the popular pulse and for its practical and energetic response to the agitation so long persisted in by John Howard and at this time received through a chance correspondence of The Gazette The result of the Dallas meeting is of far more importance to the state than the origin of the agitation that led up to it and mention is made of the latter only becsuse The Gazette is indisposed to remain silent

Dec IC 1S87 To the E 31tor of the Gazette The statement made by your reporter from this pltce That the Rembert opera house had been discontinued for the rea son that it is considered unsafe is false and without warrant and we consider all such statements as an intention to damage our house and denounce such as designing without cause Mayfield Luckett Managers of Rembert Opera House A Visit to Caddo Poak Joshua Tex Dec 15 1837 To the Editor of the Gazette Sir Having traveled on every railroad out of your city and not being able to get out of sight of the majestic Caddo Peak I determined to stop over at the nearest depot which is Joshua twenty miles south of your city and visit this great natural observatory It is two miles south of Joshua on the edge of the tim termed a truncated cone of beautiful shape It i3 a half mile in circumference at its base and at its top or apex 100 yards in circumference 300 feet high and as nice as if tnrown up by man Erom this grand out look we can trace the Brazos river four hundred miles in its meanderings tne great network of railroads rivers creeks etc for hundreds of miles in every di rection Moreover all farms houses towns and cities including two of the largest Fort Worth and Dallas are in view as far as our vision aided by tele scopes can rescb for there is nothing to obstruct vision unless it be the curvature of the earth While taking these views for at least two hours our mind ran back to the Mammoth Cave Niagara Falls the Lookout mountain Stone mountain and other natural curiosities but came to the conclusion that I was standing on a greater curiosity than any of them and if properly improved would bring people from all quarters A fortune lays idle for the want of enterprise or capital we know not which Let our Eort

Hoggs visit to San Antonio to see that the law was enforced etc and that he said it is folly for juries to pass upon the constitutionality of the law etc Your correspondent i3 very much sur prised at AttorneyGeneral Hogg In the light of the Nineteenth century and the decision of the jury in Justice court of San Antonio it would be well for him to appeal the drummer case to that high tribunal and have Judge Sabins opinion reversed We are sure that if the attorneys for Mugler in the Kansas prohibition case knew of this superior court that they would appeal from the United States Su preme court and have its decision re versed and Mugler could then make the Kansas treasury howl We understand that San Antonio wool growers are kicking against the message of President Cleveland and that they would support the Republican nominee etc Now Mr Editor this places the Democratic party in a serious position and we think that a session of the nation al Democratic committee should be called at once and have the matter of the Demo cratic nominee referred to this self same justice Jury so that like Davy Crockett we may be sure that we are right and then go ahead The eyes of the nation are on San Antonio and this justice jury and will watch with interest further develop ments from this sainted citv Hitty McGinn Mra Goodley and the Tramps My dear please dont destroy the weeds In the back yard
