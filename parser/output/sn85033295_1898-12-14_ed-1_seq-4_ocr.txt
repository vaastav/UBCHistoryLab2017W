T. Ellarson, state fish and game warden, says that some minor changes will probably be made in the present laws for the protection of fish and game at the session of the legislature this winter. The present laws are working well in most cases, and the changes will not be radical. Mr. Ellarson is of the opinion that soi ing shooting of game will be pro hibited and there will be changes made regarding fishing in the outly ing waters of the state. The changes will be made in order to make our game laws correspond with those of adjoining states. —Madison Journal. Th 3 great majority of Wisconsin Republicans would be displeased to have* Attorney-General-elect Hicks surrender the three positions in his department to so-called LaFollette workers, even though he feels under obligations to this faction for his nomination. And we do not believe that so sagacious a man as Mr. Hicks intends to take such foolish action as to choose as his first assistant a person who is not acceptable to Governor Scofield. Certainly neither Mr. Roe nor Mr. Long would fill the bill in this way, able lawyers though they may be. On the other hand, the appointment of 0. E. Buell, of Madison, would, we think,give gener al satisfaction. He is reputed to be an attorney of merit, and from what little we know of him, we feel that he is a gentleman of even temperament and pleasing manners. He presided at the Republican congressional con vention held here last September and made an excellent impression upon all who followed the convention’s proceedings. Washington Letter -1 From our Regular Correspondent.! Washington, December 9, 1898. President McKinley, by the wise omissions from his annual message to congress, has greviously disap pointed the Democrats. That is why the whole menagerie is snarling. They thought,or had persuaded them selves that they thought, the presi dent would announce a hide-bound policy towards the Philippines in ad vance of the actual possession of those islands by the United States, but the president isn’t that sort of a statesman. He doesn’t make up his mind upon any subject blind folded, least of all upon such an important one as the future of 8,000,000 help less people. He has delivered them from the evils of Spanish rule, and will give them a military government that will be far better than any gov ernment they haveever known. Tnat is far enough to go for some time to come. He will know more about the subject before recommending the next step. There are other omissions from the message that are equally wise, and they are equally as nag ging to the Democrats, who have no other hope for future success than the mistakes they expect the Repub licans to make. President McKinley possesses the faculty of knowing what not to say as well as what to say. That is one reason his adminis tration has been such a success. Fighting over empty honors is an old Democratic specialty. So the wrangling between Bailey and anti- Bailey Democrats as to who shall lead the Democrats in the next house is no innovation. Bailey leads some of the Democrats in the present house, and claims the right by reason of his having received the Democratic caucus nomination for speaker, to lead them all. Notwith standing the trouble it has brought him, Bailey wants to hold the same job in the next house; hence the present wrangling. Senator Vest has offered a resolu tion declaring that this government has no constitutional right to acquire or govern colonies, and given notice of his intention to make a speech on the resolution. The reso lution is clearly intended as a “feeler’ of the public as well as the senate; ascertain how a partisan Demo cratic tight on expansion would be received. Some Democratic senators will follow Vest, hut Senator Morgan who is one of them, said of the Vest resolution; “The resolution is a little late. The constitutionality of acquiring territory was settled when we took Alaska. The annexation ot Hawaii is another fact- accomplished, r*o that no question for considera tion remains. For one, I do not propose t see the Republicans get all the glory of the results of the war. It was not a partisan war to begin with, and the American flag haying been planted in the Philippines,. 1 want to lea participator in the glory which attaches to its presence there.” That congress will provide for a revival of the grades of admiral and vice-admiral in the navy seems reasonably certain. It has been rec ommended b3 r the president and the secretary of the navy; Senator Hale has offered a resolution providing for this revival, and Senator Morrill has presented the resolution adopted by the Vermont legislature, asking that the grade of admiral be revived, and that Rear Admiral Dewey be pro moted thereto. There is no such op position in congress to the revival of these naval grades as there is to the recommendation of General Miles that in the reorganization of the army one general and two lieutenant generals should be provided for. Similar recommendations have been made in the past by Generals Sher man and Schofield, but opposition in congress has always prevented ac tion. Speaker Reed had a very pleasant conference this week with President McKinley and arranged for another to take place as soon as the speaker has conferred with his Republican colleagues on the house committee on rules and the other Republican leaders in the house, and they have agreed upon the legislative pro gramme to be followed at this ses sion. As soon as that programme has been determined upon the speaker will submit it to the presi dent for approval and amendment. The same harmony that existed at the last session between the execu tive and legislative branches of the government is to be continued, so far as it is in the power of the Re publicans in the house tocontinueit. The senate, on account of its present make-up —no party with a majority— is necessarily an uncertain quantity in the legislative programme. The only material difference between the government of Hawaii and New Mexico, Arizona, or Okla homa, after the bill carrying out the recommendations of the Hawaiian commission has become a law, as it is sure to in due time, will be that in the former territory there will be a property and an educational quali fication for suffrage. The hills which have been intro duced to both house and senate for the reorganization of the army do not follow the recommendations of General Miles, because it is not be lieved that a bill carrying as many high officers as he recommends could get through congress. The bills in troduced provide for a lieutenant general, six major-generals and twelve brigadier-generals. The Milwaukee wheat market yes terday was moderately active and %c higher, closing at 65%c for No. 1 and for No. 2 Northern. Flour was unchanged. Bailey closed at 48c, rye at 53%c, corn at 32c, and oats at 28%c. Hogs were slightly higher, ranging at $3.30@53.45 for packing grades.
