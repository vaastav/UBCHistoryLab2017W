THE REPORT OK THE SECRETARY OF WAR shows that the army has been well and : 1I i: J .1 . .. vuuuuiuu niiy supplied, inai our small . force has been actively employed, and lias faithfully performed all the service required of it. The morale of the army ha9 Improved, and the number of deser tions has materially decreased during the year. The Secretary recommends 1. That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lieutenant Henrv If. Bptmer, Eighteenth Infantry, who lost his lifo by yellow fever while in command of the steamer J. M. Chambers, sent with supplies for the relief of sufferers in the South from that disease. 2. The establishment of the annuitv scheme tor the benefit of the heirs of deceased officers, as suggested by the Paymaster General. 3. The adoption. by Congress ol a plan for the publication "of the records of the war of the rebellion, now being prepared lor that purpose. 4. The increase of the extra per diem of the soldier teachers employed in post schools, and liberal appropriations for the erection ol buildings for schools and li braries at the different posts. 5. The repeal or amendment of the act tf June 18, 1878, forbidding the "use of the army as a posse comilatus, or other wise, lor the purpose of executing the laws, except in such cases and under such circumstances as may be expresly au thorized by the Constitution or by act of Congress. 6. The passage of a joint resolution of Congress legalizing the issues of rations, tents and medicines which were made tor the relief of sufferers Irom yellow fever. 7. That provision be made" for the erec tion of a fire-proof building for the pre servation of certain valuable records, now constantly exposed to destruction by fire. These recommendations are all coin mended to your lavornble consideration. THE NAVV. The report ol the Secretary of the Navy shows that the navy ha9 improved during the last fiscal year. Work has been done on seventy -live vessels, ten ol which have been thoroughly repaired and made ready lor sea. Two others are in rapid progress towards completion. The total expendi tures of the year, including the amount appropriated for the deficiencies ol the previous year, were $17,468,392 65. The actual expenses chargeable to the year, exclusive of these deficiencies, were $13, 306.914 09. or $767,199 18 less than those of the previous year, and $4,948,677 74 less than the expenses, including the de ficiencies. The estimates tor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, are $14,562. S81 45 exceeding the appropriations of the present year only $33,949 75 ; which excess i3 occasioned by the demands of the Naval Academy and the Marine Corps lis explained in the Secretary's report. The appropriations fjr the present fiscal year are $14,528,431 70. which, iu. the opinion of the Secretarywill be ample for all the current expenses of the de partment during the year. The amount drawn from the Treasury Irom July 1 to November 1. 1878, is $4,740,544 i4 ol which $70,980 75 ha9 beeu refunded, leaving as the expend ture lor that period $4,669 503 39. or . $520,899 24 Lisa than the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. THE 

VOST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT. The report of the Postmaster-General embraces a detailed statement of the operations of the Posc-office Department. The expenditure ol that department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were $34,165,084 49 The receipts, including sales of stamps, mone -order business and official stamps, were $29,277,516 95. 'I he sum of $290,436 90, included in the foregoing statement of expenditures, is chargeable to preceding years, so that the actual expenditures lor the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878. are $33,874.647 60. The amount drawp from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to the revenues ot the Department, was $5,307,652 82. The expenditures lor the fiscal year end- i.fc uuuo ou, looo, aro estimated at $36, 671,900 and the receipts Irom all sources at $30,664,023 90. leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the'Treasury ot $5, 907,876 10. The report calla attention to the fact that the compensation of Post masters and of railroads tor carryino- the mail is regulated by law, and that" the failure ot Congress to appropriate the amounts required tor these purposes does not relieve the Government of responsi bility, but necessarily increases the de ficiency bills which Congress will be called upon to pass. In providing lor the postal service, the following questions are presented : Should Congress annually appropriate a sum lor its expepsi s largely in excess ot its rev enues, or should such rates of postage bo established as will make the department self-sustaining P Should the postal service be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which does not pay its way P Should the number of post-routes be diminished P Should other methods be adopted which will increase the revenues or diminish the expenses of the postal service? THE 

INTERNATIONAL POSTAL CONGRESS, which met at Patis May 1, 1878, and con tinued in session until June 4 ot the same year, was composed of delegates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It adopted a new convention, to take the place of the treaty concluded at Berne, October 9, 1874, which goes into effect on the 1st of ApriJ, 1879, between the countries whose delegates have signed it. It was ratified and approved, byand with the consent of the President, Au gust 13. 1878. A tvnnnaia nl ihlaITr,S versal Postal Convention will be lound in , the report of the Postmaster-General, and the full text in the appendix thereto-.' In its origin the Postal Union comprised twenty-threo countries, having a popula tion of three hundred and fifty millions ot people. Un the 1st of Apt 11 next it will comprise lorty three countries ana colo. nies, with a population of more than six hundred and filly millions ol people, and win soon, dv the accession ot the few re maining countries and colonies which maintain organized postal services, con stitute. in fact as well as in name, as its hew title Indicates, a Universal Union. regulating, upon a unilorm basis ot cheap postage-rules, me postal intercourse be tween all civilized nations. Some embarrassment lias arisen out of the conflict between the customs laws ot this country and the provisions ot the fostal Convention, in regard to the trans missions ot foreign books and newspapers to tins country by maw. It is hoped that Congress will be able to devise some means of reconciling the uiuiuuuies which nave inus oeen creaieu, so as to do justice to all parties involved. THE SUPREME COURT. The business ot the Supreme Court, and of the courts in many of the circuits, has increased to such an extent during the past years that additional legislation is imperative to relieve and prevent the delay ol justice, and possible oppression to suitors, which is thus occasioned. The encumbered condition of these dockets is presented anew in the report ot the Attorney-General, and the remedy suggested is earnestly urged for Congressional ac tion. The creation ot additional circuit judges, as proposed, would afford a com plete remedy, and would involve an ex pense at the present rate of salaries ot not more than $60,000 a year. DIDIAN AFFAIR8. The annual reports of the Secretary of the interior and ot the Commissioner of Indian Affairs present an elaborate ac count of the present condition of the In dian tribes, and of that branch of tho pub lic service which ministers to their in terests. While the conduct ot the In dians, generally, has been orderly, and their relations with their neighbors friend ly and peaceful, two local disturbances have occurred, which were deplorable In their character, but remained. haoDilv. confined to a comparatively small num- oer ot Indians. Ihe discontent anions' the Bannocks, which led first to some acts ot violence on the part of some mem bers ot the tribe and finally to the outbreak appears to have been caused by an insufficiency ot food ou the reservation, and this insufficiency to have been owing to the inadequacy of the appropriations made by Congress to the wants of the Indians. at a time when the Indians were pre vented irom supplying the deficiency by hunting. Atter an arduous pursuit bv the troops of the United Stales, and several en gagements, the hostile Indians were re duced to subjection, and the larger part of them surrendered themselves as prison ers. t In this connection. I desire to call attention to the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that a sufficient fund be placed at the disposal ot me r,xecuuve, io oe usea, with proper accountability, at discretion, in sudden emergencies ot the Indian service. THE 

NORTHERN ClIEYENNES. The Other rasa ot Hiatnrhanna vuaa ih.it of a band of Northern Cheyennes, who suddenly left their reservation in the In dian Territory and marched rapidly through the Slates ol Kansas and Nebraska in the direction ol their old hunting grounds, committing murders and other crimes on their way. From documents accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Interior, it appears this diamrlnriv band was as fully supplied with the neces saries ot hie as the lour thous nd seven hundred other Indians who rHninim.il quietly on the reservation, and that the disturbance was caused by men ol a rest- ess ana miscnievous disposition among the Indians themselves. Almnct tku nhnU of this band have surrendered to the mili tary authorities, and it is a gratilying tact that, when some of them had taken reiuge in the camp ol the lied Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in Irieudly relations, the Sioux beid them as . prisoners and rapidly gave them up the officers of the United States, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors toJ the contrary notwithstanding, they have untormly shown ever since the wishes they expressed at the council vt Septem ber, 1877, had been complied with. '., '.' A RECOMMENDATION. Both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary ot War uuite in the recom mendation that provision be made by Con gress for the organization of a corps of mounted "Indian auxiliaries," to be un der the control of the army, and to be used tor the purpose of keeping the In dians on their reservations and prevent ing or repressing disturbance on their part. I earnestly concur in this recom mendation. It is believed that the or ganization ot such a bodv of I nil tan nmr. airy, receiving a moderate pay from the government, would considerably weaken the restless element among the Indians by withdrawing from it a number ot young men and giving them congenial employ ment under the Government, it bein a matter of experience that Indians iu ourser vice almost without exception are faithful in the performance of the duties assigned to them. Such an organization would materially aid the army in theuccomplbh ment ot a task tor which its numerical strength is sometimes found insufficient. COUNSELING KINDNESS. - ' Rut. while the employment of lorc for the prevention or repression of Indian troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation should be made to that end. greater reliance must be placed on humane and civilizing agencies tor the ultimate solution ot what is called the In dian problem. It may be very difficult, and require much patient effort, to curb the unruly spirits of the savage Indians i io restraints ot civilized lite, but etoeri- ence shows that it is not impossible. Many of the tribes which are now quiet and or derly and sell-supporting were once as savage as auy that at present roam over the plains or la the mountains of the far West, and were then considered Inacces sible to civilizing influences. It may be impossible to raise them fully up to the level of the white population ol the United States; but we should not forget that they are the aborigines ot the country, anil called the soil their own on which our people have grown rich powerful and happy. VVe owe it to them as a moral duty to help them in attaining at leust that degree of civilization which they may be able to reach. It is not only our duty it is also our interest to do so. Indians who have become agriculturists or herds men, and feel an interest in property, will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and disturbing element. It is also a well au thenticated fact that Indians are apt to be peaceable and quiet when their children are at school, and lam gratified to know, Irom the expression ol Indians themselves and from many concurring reports, that there is a steadily increasing desire, even among Indians belonging to comparatively wild tribes, to have their children educa ted. I invite attention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the Com missioner ol Indian Affairs, touching the experiment receniiv inaugurated, in taking fifty Indian children, boys and girls, from different tribes, to the (lamp ton Normal Agricultural Institute, in Virginia where they are to. receive an elementary English education and training in agriculture and other useful work, to be returned to their tribes, after the com pleted course, as interpreters, instructors. and examples. It is reported that the officer charged with the selection of those children might have had thousands of young Indians sent with him had it been possible to make provision lor them. 1 agree with the Secretary of the Interior in saying that "the result i this interest ing experiment, if lavor.ible. may be des tined to become an important lactor in the advancement ot civilization among the Indians " The question, whether a change in the control ot the Indian service should be made, was. at the last session of Congress, referred to noommittee tor inquiry and re port. Without desiring to anticipate that report, I venture to express the hope that in the decision ol so important a Question. the views expressed above niav not. be lost sight of, and that the decision, whatever it may hp, will arrest lurther agitation at this subject, such agitation oeing apt, to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as on the Indians themselves. THE HOT SPRINGS COMMISSION. In the enrolment of the bill making ap propriations lor sundry civiljexpenses, at the last session ot Congress that portion wmcn proviuen lortne continuation ol the Hot Springs Commission was omitted. As the Commitioner had completed the work of taking testimony on the many conflicting claims, the suspension of their labors, before determining the rights of claimants, threatened, lor a time, to em barrass the interests, not only of the Gov ernment, but also a large number ol' the citizens of Hot Springs, who were waiting tor hnal action on their claims betore beginning contemplated improveruents. In order to prevent serious difficulties, which were apprehended, and at the soli citation ol many leading citizens of Hot springs, and others interested in the wel fare of the town, the Secretary of the In terior was authorized to request the late commissioners to take charge of the rec ords of their proceedingc, and to perform such work as could properly be done by them under such circumstances, to facili tate the future adjudication of the claims at an early day, and to preserve the status of the claimants until their rights should be finally determined. The late comrhis sioneis complied with that request, and report that (he testimony, in all the cases, has been written out, examined, briefed, and so arranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorized by law. It is recommended that the .requisite au thority be given at as early a day in the session as possible, and that a fair com pensation be allowed the late commission ers for the expense incurred and the la bor performed by them since the 25th ot June last. TIMBER LANDS. ' I invite the attention of Congress to the recommendations made by Secretary of the Interior with regard to the preserva tion ot the timber on the public lands of the United Stales. The protiction of the public property is one of the first duties of the Government. The Department of the Interior should , therefore be enabled by sufficient appropriations to enforce the laws in that respect. But this matter appears still more important as a question ot publio economy. The rapid destruction ol our forests is an uvil fraught with the gravest consequences, especially in the mountainous districts, where the rocky slopes, once denued ot their trees, will re main so forever. There the injury, once done, can not be repaired. I fully concur with the Secretary of the Interior in the opinion that, for this reason, a legislation touching the publio timber in the moun. tainous States and Territories of the West, should be especially well considered, and that existing laws, in which the destruc tion of the forests is not sufficiently guard ed against, should be speedily modified. A general law concerning this important subject appears to me to be a matter of urgent publio necessity. : From the organization ot the Govern ment, the Importance ot encouraging, by an possioia means, me increase ot our agricultural productions has been acknow ledged and urged upon the attention of Congress and the people as the surest and readiest means of increasing our substan tial and enduring prosperity. i i THE WORDS OF WASHINGTON '; "', are so applicable to-day as when, in his eighth annual message, he said : 'It is not to be doutbed that with reference eith er to individual or natural welfare, agri culture is ot primary importance. In proportion as nations, advance n popula tion and other circumstances ot maturity, the truth becomes moro apparent, and renders the cultivation of the) soul more and more an object ot publio patronage. Institutions for promoting it grow up, supported by the publio purse and to that object 'can it be dedicated with greater propriety P Among the means which haye been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater success than the establishment ot boards composed of proper characters, charged with collecting and diffusing iolormation and enabled, by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to- encourage and assist the spirit of discovery and Improvement. this species ot establishment contributing uouoiey io me increase ot Improvement by stimulating to enterprise and exoeri ment, and by drawing to a common cen ter the results everywhere ol individim! skill and observation, and spreading them uience over the whole nation. Expert ence accordingly hath shown that they are very cheap instruments of immense national benefit."
