OPENING OP CONGRESS —IN THE HOUSE. Washington, Dec. 2.—The beginning oi the third and last session of the Forty-second Con gress, so far as the House is concerned, was more interesting than such exercises usually are. The galleries were fairly filled by a re spectable assemblage, and the floor gave token of a considerable number of members in ex cess of a quorum. A pleasanter feeling among members was never known, and Democrats, Liberals and Administration men vied with each other in the heartiness of manner which charac ized their intercourse. It was scarcely to be ex pected that the close of such a bitter political contest, in which personal ideas and criminal charges were a prominent feature, should have left so little resentment as was shown to-day, both before the session began and during its continuance. This state of facts gives promise of an amicable and decorous session, such os has not been known for many years. In the congratu lations and greetings among the members of different political shade, if the subject of poli tics arose it was passed off with a laugh, and there were no longer charges of corrupt voting, nor of party nor of political infidelity. Expres sions of respect for Mr. Greeley and of sorrow for his sudden death were heard on every side, and not one word of censure or reproach passed from the lips of the most bitter or thoughtless partisan. The Chaplain gave tone to the general feeling when ho bespoke fuller charity and understanding among men. A prom inent subject of regret was the defeit of Sunset Cox, whose ready wit and genial manners had become a feature in the House for so many years. His absence will be heartily regretted on both sides of the halL His standing among his asso ciates, and the regret attending his defeat, were well illustrated in his treatment to-day. He was selected by almost unanimous choice, in an in formal manner, to reply to the resolutions of respect offered by Mr. Dawes for Mr. Greeley’s character, and he discharged his duty most suc cessfully. He was also chosen to the chair when Speaker Blaine presented the resolution for an investigation into the Credit Mobilier scandal. As soon as the preliminaries of the session had been gone through, the credentials of new mem bers elected to fill unexpired terms, were pre sented. In consequence of the near-sighted ness of the Clerk, the name of Governor Noyes, of Ohio, was called instead cf that of Colonel Dodd, who fills A. F. Perry’s place, but as he did not present himself, the error was cor rected after considerable merriment. After the Greeley resolution had been adopted, Gen eral Barks arose, and in a few well chosen terms, and with modest manner, said he was not in harmony with the foreign policy of the Govern ment, and, therefore, begged that the House would accept his resignation as a member and Chairman of the Foreign Committee. _ The question as to acceptance of his resigna tion had been put, and the affirma tive vote taken, when James Brooks, of New York, protested that the House ought not to accept, and one or two Bepublicans also urged its withdrawal; so the majority, by this time, saw what an ungenerous act they wore about to do, and, when the vote was again put, the majority in favor of Banks remaining ; at the head of the Commiteee was large. All the Massachusetts members except Butler voted for Banks; also most of the Ohio members. Garfield did not vote. After the short speech of Mr. Blaine on the Credit Mobilier, and the passage of his resolution, a short recess was taken. Then followed the reading of the President’s message, and the House adjourned until to-morrow. I THE 

PBESIDENT TO ATTEND MB. Q BEE LEY’S FD- NEBAL. The decision of the President to attend the funeral of Mr. Greeley in New York on Wednes day, is receiTed here by ail parties with great CHICAGO, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1872 praise. It is known that several members of the Cabinet have also decided to go, and there will be a considerable number of Senators and mem- several citizens and Government of- 

JUDICIAL RESIGNATION. A report, the accuracy of which seems beyond question, came from the White House, to-day, that Associate Justice Nelson, of the United States Supreme Court, had tendered his resigna tion of his office to the President. Judge Nel son is over 80 years of age, and his last official act was the signing of the Treaty of Washing ton, in the negotiation of which he participated as one of the joint High Commission, 

CALLERS AT THE WHITE !lIOUBE. Tbe Supreme Court, with the Chief Justice at ttie head, made the usual official call on the President at the beginning of a regular term here to-day. Thera was an ominous growl among the anti- Civil Service reformers when that part of the President’s message was read to-day which relates to Civil Service reform. There is a storm brewing in this direction, which is likely to break out as soon as a sufficient number of this class of politicians are satisfied that the President is really in earnest. At present they only affect to believo that the President will yield to party pressure when this influence is properly brought to bear to secure appointments. There seems to be more hard feeling toward Senator Schnrz on the part of the Republican Senators than any of nls Liberal colleagues. The argument that is now principally used is that he should be displaced from the Foreign Relations Committee altogether, not so much because of his hostility to the Administration as from the fact that he is a foreigner, and from the affected belief that his entire sympathies are un-American. This style of argument seems to prevail very largely among the Administra tion Senators, although nothing definite as yet been agreed on. It may be safely stated that Schurz will be removed from this Committee ; that Trumbull will be kept from the Judiciary Committee; and that Fenton will be retired from the Chairmanship of the Committee on Contingent Expenses. It seems to be the general feeling in the Senate that the Lib erals should all be humiliated as much as possi ble. The caucus to settle all the speculations will not be had until to-morrow. Oakes Ames 1 arrival here, to-day, was as tonishing and unexpected. His own col leagues were of the opinion that this noted Congressman had so much business else where to attend to that he would not find it convenient to be in Washington this winter. To-day, on his own behalf, in reply to numerous interrogatories, Mr. Ames sain that so far as he was concerned he was willing that the Investigation Committee should be com posed entirely of Democrats, and that the inves tigation should be thorough enough to satisfy the honest men of all parties in the country. It is wickedly suggested in some quarters, in view of his past reticence on this subject, tnat Ames is probably now satisfied that the original letters and papers on which the charges were based were now destroyed, and that there is no evidence to be got at outside of McComb’s per sonal statements.

THREE PEB CENTS CALLED. Washington Dec. 2. —The Secretary of the Treasury calls in the S per cent certificates from Nov. 7, 1868, to Nov. 22, 1868, of denominations of $5,000 each, numbered 5,178 to 5,403 inclu sive, .and of denominations of SIO,OOO. and num bered 4,801 to 4,822 inclusive. The amount of certificates described is $850,000, upon which in terest ceases Jan. 31, 1873. The publio debt has decreased $1,198,229 dur ing the month. The Senate met at noon, the Vice President in the chair, and all the leading Senators present, with largely more than a quorum. The Chaplain, in his 'opening prayer, alluded to the death of Mr. Greeley as that of one whose pen had given direction to publio thought and had been a benefaction to mankind. The House was notified of the Senate's readi ness, and a number of bills were introduced, among them one by Mr. 

SUMNEE, as follows: "Wheheas, National unity and good-will among fel low-citizens can bo assured only through the oblivion of past differences, and It is contrary to the usage of civilized nations to perpetuate the memory of civil war; therefore, Be it enacted, &e., That the names of battles with fellow-citizens shall not be continued in the Army Register, or placed on the regimental colors of the United States. HEW SENATORS. Mr. STEVENSON (Ky.) presented the cre dentials of General Machin, Sr., from Ken tucky, to succeed Garret Davis, and he was sworn in. The VICE PRESIDENT presented the creden tials of Mr. Morrill, elected from Vermont. Mr. WILSON introduced a hill for the relief of sufferers by the Boston fire. This bill is similar to bill for the relief of the Chicago sufferers. 

PENSION BILL. Mr. CAMERON (Pa.) introduced a bill grant ing a pension of $2,000 a year to the widow of General Meade. All these bills were tabled to await the organi zation of the Committees. Mr. ANTHONY offered a resolution that, at 1 o'clock on Monday next, the Senate proceed to the consideration of the calendar. Laid over. RESOLUTION OP INQUIRY. Mr. BICE (Ark.) offered a resolution asking the President to furnish information in regard to the recent application for United States troops to be sent to Arkansas, statingwhere and by whom the application was made, for what purpose the troops were to be used, and what action has been taken in the matter. Mr. 

EDMONDS said the resolution had better lie over. Mr. MOEBILL (Vt.) gave notice that, on Wednesday next, he would make remarks on the amendment to the bill for the endowment of the National College. Mr. POMEEOY offered a concurrent resolu tion to suspend the twenty-first joint rule, which prohibits the passage during the first six days of the session of any hill remaining over from the last session. Laid over and ordered printed. Mr. SCOTT (Pa*) offered a resolution re appointing the Senate Conference Committees upon all bills on which committees of conference were appointed last session, and failed to Report,. or on which the reports made were notdisposed; of. Laid over. I Mr. SUMNER moved the present consideration of his Civil Rights bill. Mr. 

POMEROY made a point of order that under the twenty-first joint role it could not be considered. The VICE-PRESIDENT sustained the point of order. Mr. POMEROY said he did not raise the point of order because he opposed the bilL He was in favor of it. • The Vice President appointed Messrs. Conk ling and Thurman a Committee on the part of the Senate to wait upon the President. The Senate then took a recess till 1:30 p. m. After the recess, a message was received from the House announcing the adoption of the con current resolution in regard to the death of Hor ace Greeley. Mir. 

PENTON moved immediate consideration, and it was unanimously agreed to. Mr. CONKLING, from the Committee to wait upon the President, announced that it hod dis charged its dutw { and the President would com municate in writing. The annual message was then brought in by General Babcock, and read by the Clerk. Three thousand extra copies of the message were ordered printed. The 

VICE PRESIDENT presented the annual reports of the several departments. Tabled. Senate adjourned HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. CAIiLED TO ORDER. The House was called to order at noon by Speaker BLAINE. The attendance was very large, and the galleries were crowded with spectators. The proceedings were opened with prayer by the Chaplain, Rev. J. G. Butler. The roll of mem bers was then called, and 149 answered to their names. The following new members were sworn in : Joseph B. "Hawley, Conn.; Constantine 0. Esty,

RESIGNATION. Mr. BANKS offered his resignation as Chair man of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but the House, by a vote of 76 to 59, refused to ac cept it. TFTW CREDIT MOBILtER HT ATTF.It. Speaker BLAINE then called Mr. COX (N. Y.) to the choir, as Speaker pro tem,, and took the floor to offer the following resolution: Whebeas, Accusations have been made in the public press, founded on the alleged letters of Oakes Ames, a Representative from Massachusetts, and upon the affi davit of Henry S. M’Comb, a citizen of Wilmington, in the State of Delaware, to the effect that members of this House were bribed by Oakes Ames to perform certain legislative acts for the benefit of the Union Pacific Railroad Company by presents of stock in the Credit Mobiller of America, or by presents of a valu able character derived therefrom: therefore, Resolved, That a special committee of five members be appointed by the Speaker, pro tempore, whose duty it shall be to investigate and ascertain whether any member of thla House was bribed by Oakes Ames or any person or corporation in any manner touching his legislative duty, and that the Committee be authorized to send for persons and papers. Mr. BLAINE said he had requested Mr. Cox to appoint a majority of Democrats on the Com mittee, and made a few remarks challenging in vestigation. Mr. AECHER opposed the motion, on the ground that the scandal had been refuted and in vestigation was unnecessary. Mr. BANDALL favored it, as a matter of per sonal privilege. Mr. DAWES said he hoped the resolution would ho adopted. The resolution was adopted with a few nega tive votes on the Democratic side, and Mr. Cox, as Speaker pro tem., appointed as the Select Committee Messrs. Poland. Banks, Beck, Nib lack, and McCrary. THE DEATH OP MB. GREELEY. Mr. DAWES said: Mr. Speaker. Believing that all will concur in the propriety of the public recognition of events so impressive and so with out parallel in the history of this Government, that nave recently transpired, I deem it proper to offer the following resolution: Resolved, By the Senate and Honse of Representa tives, in view of the recent death of Horace Greeley, for whom, at the late election, more than three million votes were cast for President, that a record be made on the Journals of Congress of its appreciation for the eminent services and persona] parity and worth of the deceased, and of the sad impression created by his death, following a keen family bereavement. Mr, COX (N. Y.) then paid a feeling tribute to the memory and character of Mr. Greeley, after which the resolution was unanimously adopted. 

RESIGNATION AGAIN TENDERED, Mr. BANKS again rose and offered his resigna tion as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, remarking that it was proper that the House should he represented by one who was unqualifiedly committed to the policy of the ma jority, as he could not claim to he. The House, by a vote of 59 to 76, refused to accept the resignation. INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILE. Mr. SAEGENT, from the Committee of Ways and Means, reported the Indian Appropriation bill, which was made the special orddr for the 10th insi.. .He stated that the amonnfc appropri ated under it was $5,379,365, being $982,697 less than in the same time last year. MEMBER RESIGNED. The Speaker presented the resignation of Mr. Mercer, of Pennsylvania, who has been elected Judge of the Supreme Court of that State. TUB MESSAGE. After a short recess the President's message was, at 1:40 p. m., received and read. The mes sage was ordered to be printed. OTHER APPROPRIATION BILLS. Mr. GAEFIELD, from the Committee on Ap propriations, reported the Pension Appropria tion bill, which was made the special order for Wednesday of next week. The bill appropri ates $30,480,000. The Legislative Executive and Judicial Appro priation bill was also reported, which was made the special order for Thursday of next week. Messrs. 

TWICHELL and BUTLEB intro duced bills for the relief of the sufferers by the Boston fire. Referred. Mr. SCOFIELD introduced a bill for the re duction of the officers and expenses of the In ternal Revenue Department. Beferred. The House adjourned. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To the Senate and House of Representatives: In transmitting to you my fourth annual Mes sage, it is with thankfulness to the Giver of All Good that as a Nation, we have been blest for the last year with peace at home and abroad, and a general prosperity vouchsafed to but few people. With the exception of ,the recent de vastating fire which swept from l earth with a breath, as it were, millions of accumulated wealth in the City of there have been no over-shadowing calamities.'within the year to record. It is gratifying note how like their fellow-citizens of the cm OP 

CHICAGO, under similar circumstances a year earlier, the citizens of Boston are rallying under their mis fortunes, and the prospect is, that their energy and perseverance will overcome all obstacles, and uhow the same prosperity soon that they woul 1 have shown had no disaster befallen them. Otherwise we have been free horn pesti lence, war, and calamities which often overtake nations, and, as far as human judgment can penetrate the future, no cause seems to exist to threaten our present peace. THE 

WASHINGTON TREATY. When Congress adjourned in June last, a question had been raised by Great Britain, and was then pending, which, for a time, seriously imperilled the settlement by friendly arbitra tion of the differences existing between this Government and that of Her Britannic Majesty; the treaty of Washington had been referred to the Tribunal of Arbitration which had met at Geneva, in Switzerland. The Arbitrators, how ever, disposed of the question which had jeop ardized the whole of the treaty, and threatened to involve the two nations in the most unhappy relations towards each other, in a manner entire ly satisfactory to this Government, and in ac cordance with the views and the policy which it had maintained. The Tribunal which had con vened in Geneva in December, con cluded its laborious session on the 14th day of September last, on which day, .having availed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty to award a sum m. gross, it made its decision, whereby it award .ed the sum of $15,500,000 in gold, as the indem nity to be paid by Great Britain to the United States, for the satisfaction of all the claims re ferred for its consideration. This decision happily disposes of a long stand ing difference between the two Governments; and, in connection with another award made by the German Empexpr, under a rererence to bim by the same treaty, leaves the two Governments • without a shadow upon the friendly relations 'which it is my sincere hope may forever remain equally unclouded. The report of the agent of the United States, .appointed to attend the Geneva Tribunal, ac companied by the protocols of the proceedings of the Arbitrators; the arguments of the coun sel of both Governments; the award of the .Tribunal, and the opinions given by the several Arbitrators is transmitted herewith. I have caused to be communicated to the heads of the three friendly powers who complied with the joint request made to themunderthe Treaty, the thanks of this Government for the appoint ment of the Arbitrators, made by them, respec tively, and also my thanks to the eminent per sonages named by them, and my appreciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality, and great ability with which they discharged their arduous and high functions. Her Majesty’s Government has communicated to me its appreciation by Her Majesty of the ability and indefatigable industry displayed by Mr. Adams, the Arbitrator named on the part of this Government during the protracted in quiries and discussions of the Tribunal. 1 cor dially unite with Her Majesty in this apprecia tion. It is due to the agent of the United States before the Tribunal, to record my appreciation of the marked ability, unwearied patience, and the prudence and discretion with which he has conducted the very responsible and delicate duties committed to him ; as it is also due to the learned and emi nent counsel who attended the Tribunal on the part of this Government, to express my sense of the talents and wisdom which they brought to bear in the argument of the result so happily reached. DISTRIBUTION OF THE AWARD. It will be the province of Congress to provide for the distribution among those who may be entitled to it. of their respective shares of tho money to be paid. Although the sum awarded is not payable until a year from the date of the award, it is deemed advisable that no time be lost in making a proper examination of the sev eral cases in which indemnification may be dne. I consequently recommend the creation of a Board of Commissioners for the purpose. THE SAN JUAN SETTLEMENT. By the thirty-fourth article of the Treaty of Washington, the respective claims of the United States and of Great Britain, in their construc tion of the Treaty of the 15th of June, 1816, defining the boundary lino between their respec tive territories, were submitted to the arbitra tion and award of His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, to decide which of these is most in accordance with the true in terpretation of the treaty of 1816. Hi a Majesty the Emperor of Germany, having been pleased to undertake the arbitration, has the earnest thanks of this Government and of the people of the United States, for the labor, pains and care which ho has devoted to the considera tion of this long-pending difference. I have caused an expression of my thanks to be com municated to His Majesty; Mr. Bancroft, the representative of this Government at Berlin, conducted the case and prepared tho statement on the part of the United States with the ability that his past service justified the public in ex pecting at his hands. As a member of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given rise to tho discussion be tween the two Governments; as the Minister to Great Britain when the construction, now pro nounced unfounded, was' first advanced, and as the agent and representative of the Government to present the case and to receive the award, he has been associated with the question in all of its phases, and in every stage has manifested a patriotic zeal, and earnest in the maintenance of the claim of the United States, he is entitled to much credit for the success winch has attended the submission. After a patient investigation of the case and of the statements of each party. 51s Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, on tne 21st day of October last, signed his award in writing, de creeing that the claim of the Government of the United States that the boundary line between the territory of Her Britannic Majesty and the United States should be drawn through the Haro Channel is most in accordance with the true in terpretation of the treaty concluded on the 15th of June, 1848, between the agents of Her Brit annic Majesty and of the United States. Copies of the case presented on behalf of each Government, and of the statement in reply of each, and a translation of the award, are transmitted herewith. This award confirms the United States in their claim to the im portant archipelago of islands lying between the continent and Vancouver’s Island, which for twenty-six years ,ever since the ratification of the treaty, Great Britain has contested, and leaves us for the first time in the history of the United States as a nation without a question of disputed boundary between our territory and the possessions of Great Britain on this continent. It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the prompt spontaneous action of Her Majesty’s Government in giving effect to the award. In anticipation of any request from this Govern ment, and before the reception in the United States of the award signed by the Emperor, Her Majesty had given instructions for the re moval of her troops which had been stationed there, and for the cessation of all exercise or claim of jurisdiction, so as to leave the United States in conclusive possession of the lately dis puted territory. lam grateful to be able to an nounce that the orders for the removal of troops have been executed, and the military joint occu pation of San Juan has ceased. The islands are now in the exclusive possession of the United States. It now becomes necessary to complete the sur vey and determination of that portion of the boundary line through the Haro Channel, upon which ‘ the Commission, which determined the remaining part of the line, were nnahle to agree. I recommend the appointment of a Commission to act jointly with one which maybe named by Her Majesty for that purpose. THE AT. A are A 

BOUKDABT. The experience of the difficulties attending the determination of our admitted line of boundary, after the occupation of the territory and its settlement by those owing allegiance to the respective - Governments, points to the im portance of establishing, by natural objects or other measurements, the actual line between the territory acquired by purchase from Russia and the adjoining poseions of Her Britannic Majesty. The region is now so sparsely occupied, that no conflicting interests of individuals or of juris diction are likely to interfere to the delay or the embarrassment of the actual location of the line. If - deferred until population wba.il enter and occupy the territory, some trivial contest of neighbors may again array the two Governments in antagonism. I, therefore, recommend the appointment of a commission to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part of Great Britain to deter mine the line between our territory of Alaska and the caterminous possessions of Great Britain. the In my last annual message I recommended leg islation necessary on the put of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the Treaty of Washington of May, 1871, relating to the fish eries and to other matters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North American possessions, to become operative so soon as the proper legislation should be had on the part of Great Britain and her pos sessions. That legislation on the part of Great Britain and its possession had not then been had, and dnring the session of Con gress a question was raised, which, for the time, raised a doubt whether any action by Congress in the direction indicated would become impor tant, —a question which has since been diposed of, and 1 have received notice that the Imperial Parliament and the Legislature of the Provin cial Government have passed laws to carry the provisions of the treaty on the matters referred to into operation. I therefore recommend your early adoption of the legislation in the same direction necessary on the part of this Govern ment. NOBTHEBN BOIJNDABT. The Joint Commission for determining the boundary line between the United States and the British Possessions, between the Lake of the Woods and the Rocky has organ ized and entered upon its work. It is desirable that the force be increased in order that the completion of the survey and determination of the boundary may be sooner completed. To this end I recommend that a sufficient appropri ation be made. FOBEIGN SEDATIONS. With France, our earliest ally; Russia, the constant and steady friend of the United States; Germany, with whose Government and people we have so many causes of friendship and so many common sympathies, and the other powers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most friendly terms. Since my last annual message, the exchange has been made of the ratifications of a treaty with the Austro-Hungarian Empire relating to naturalization; also, of a treaty with the Ger man Empire respecting Consuls and trade marks; also, of a treaty with Sweden and Norway relating to naturalization, all of which treaties have been duly proclaimed. INTEBNATIONAL STATISTICAL CONGHESS. Congress, at its last session, having made an appropriation to defray the expense of Commis sioners on the part of the United States to the International Statistical Congress at St. Peters burg, the persons appointed in that character proceeded to their destination, and attended the sessions of the Congress. The report shall, in due season, be laid before you. This Con gress meets at intervals of about three years, and has held its sessions in several of the coun tries of Europe. I submit to your consideration the propriety of extending an invitation to the Congress to hold its next meeting in the United States. The centennial celebration to be held in 1876 would afford an appropriate occasion for such meeting. THE VIENNA EXPOSITION. Preparations are making for the International Exposition, to be held during the next year in Vienna, on a scale of very great magnitude. The tendency of tbeseExpositions is in the direction of advanced civilization and the elevation of in dustry, of labor, and the increase of human hap piness, as well as of greater intercourse and goodwill between nations.- As this Exposition is to be the first which will have been neld in Eastern Europe, it is believed that American inventors and manufacturers will be ready to avail themselves of the opportunity for the presentation of their productions, if encour aged by proper aid and protection. At the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment of one or more agents to renresent this Government at the Exposition. The au thority thus given has been exercised, but in tho absence of any appropriation there is danger that the important benefits which the Exposition offers will, in a large degree, be lost to citizens of the United States* I commend the roWect NUMBER 106. strongly to your consideration, and recommend that an adequate appropriation be made for the purpose. To farther aid American exhibitors at the Vi enna Exposition, I would recommend, in addi tion to an appropriation of money, that the Sec retary of the Navy be authorized to fit up two naval vessels to transport between? our Atlantic cities and Trieste or the most convenient port to Vienna, and back/ theirs articles for exhibition. OUB RELATIONS WITH MEXICO. Since your last session, the President of the* Mexican Bepublic, distinguished by BigH character and his services to his country, has* died. His temporary successor hfw now beem elected with unanimity by the people,—a prooC of confidence on their part in his patriotism amf wisdom which, it is believed, will be confirmed by the results of his Administration. It is particularly desirable that nothing should be left undone by the Government of either Bepublic to strengthen their relations as neigh bors and friends. It is much to be regretted that many lawless acta' continue to disturb the quiet of the settlements: on the border between our Territory and that of Mexico, and that complaints of wrong to Ameri can citizens in various parts of the country are made. The revolutionary condition in which tho neighboring Bepublic has so long been involved, ■ has in some degree contributed to thia disturb ance. It is to be hoped that with a more settled rule of order throughout the Bepublic, which may be expected from the present Government, the acta of which just complaint is made will cease. The proceedings of the Commission under the Convention with Mexico of the 4th of July, 18G3, on the subject of claims, have unfortunately been checked by an obstacle, for the removal of which measures hare been taken by the two Governments which it is believed, will prove successful. The Com missioners, appointed pursuant to the joint reso lutions of Congress, of the 7th of May last, to inquire into depredations on the Texas frontier, have diligently made investigations in tnat quarter. Their report upon the subject will bo communicated to you. Their researches were necessarily incomplete, partly on account of tho limited appropriations made by Congress. Mexi co, on the part of that Government, has appoint ed a similar Commission to investigate the seout rages. It is not announced officially, but tho press of that country states that the folk is investigation is desired, and that tho co-operation of all parties concerned is invited to secure that end. 1 therefore recommend that a special appropriation be made at the earliest day practicable, to enable the Commissioners on the part of the United States to return to their labors without delay. 

CUBA. It is with regret that I have again to announce a continuance of the disturbed condition of the Island of Cuba. No advance toward the pacifi cation of the discontented portion of the popula tion has been made, while the insurrection has gained no advantages, and exhibits no more of* the elements of power, or of the prospect of ul timate success, than were exhibited a year ago. Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded in its repression, and the parties standapparent ly in the same relative attitude which they hav& occupied for a long time past. This contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were it seen at at a distance from our neighborhood, we might be indifferent to its result, although hu manity could not be unmoved by mans of its in cidents wherever they might occur. It is, how ever, at our door. I cannot doubt that the con tinued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is among the strongest inducements to the continuance oi. the strife. A terrible wrong is the nat ural cause of a terrible evil. Tha abolition of slavery and the introduction* of other reforms in the administration of th®< Government in Cuba could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. It is espe cially to be hoped that the present liberal Gov ernment of Spain will voluntarily adopt thie* view. The law of emancipation, which jwae’ passed more than two years since, nas remained unexecuted in the absence of regulations for its enforcement. It was but a feeble step toward emancipation, but it was the recognition of right and was hailed as such, and exhibited Spain in harmony with the sentiments of hu manity and of justice, and in sympathy with the other powers of the Christian and civilized world. Within the past few weeks the regu lations for carrying out the laws_ of emancipation has been giving evidence of the sincerity of intention of the present Government to carry into effect the law of 1870. I have not failed to urge tha consideration of the wisdom, the policy, and the justice of a more effective system for the aboli tion of the great evil, which oppressed a race., and continues a bloody and destructive contest* close to our own border, as well as the expe diency and the justice of conceding reforms, of which the propriety is not questioned. Deeply impressed with the conviction that'the continu ance of slavery is one of the most active causes of the continuance of the unhappy condition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United States, or those claiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what is there claimed as- Eroperty, hut which is forbidden and denounced y the laws of the United States, They are thus, in defiance of the spirit of our own laws, con tributing to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest. In my last annual mes sage I referred to this subject, and I again rec ommend such legislation as may be proper to de nounce, and, if not prevent, at least to discour age, American citizens from holding or dealing in slaves.
