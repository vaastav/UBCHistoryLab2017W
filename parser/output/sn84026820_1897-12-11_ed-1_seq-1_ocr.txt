The poblic lost engross us er partisanship, QUESTION OF CURRENCY BEFOXM. Tariff legislation having been settled by the extra session o f Congress, tbe question next pressing for considera tion is that oi the currency. The work of putting out finances upon a sound basis, difficult ,is it may seem, will appear easier when we recall the financial operations of the govern ment since 1866. On the thirtieth day of June of that year we had cutstand ing demand liabilities iu the sum of $728,868,447.41.On the first,of January, 1879 these liabilities had been reduced to $443,880,495.88. Of our interest bearing obligations, tiie ligures are even more striking. On July 1, 1886, tbe principal of the interest-bearing debt of the government was $2,332,351,208. On the first day of July, 1893, this sum had been reuuced to $585,01*7,100, or au aggregate reduction of $1,747, 294,108. Tiie interest-bearing debt t>f the Uuited Stales on the first d .y of December, 1897, was $874,365,620. Tbe government money nuw outstanding (December l)consists of $346,681,01® ot United States notes, $107,793 289 of treasury notes issued by authori y of the la a of 1890, $383,963,504 of si!» r certificates and $61,280,761 of standard silver dollars. Witb the great res mices of the gov ernment and with the b >uorable exam* pie of the past before us, we ought i»ot to hesitate to enter upon a ourrency r e * vision which will make our demand t'b ligations less onerous to the government and relieve our financial laws from am* biguity and doubt. The brief review of what was ac complished from the cluse of the w#r to 1893 makes unreasonable aud ground less any distrust either of our fluauciaf' ability or soundness;whiie the situation from 1893 to 1897 must admonish Con gress of tbe immediate necessity of bo legislating as to make ihe return of the conditions then prevailing impos sible. There are many plans proposed as a remedy for tbe evil, Before we can find tbe true remedy we must appre ciate tbe real evil. It is not that our currency of every kind is not good, for every dollar of it is good; good because the government's pledge is out to keep it so and that pledge will not be broken. However the guaranty uf our purpose to keep the pledge will be best shown by advancing toward its fulflili* ment. of The evil of tbe present system is found in tbe great cost to tbe govern ment of maintaining tbe parity of our differeut forms of money, that is,keep ing all of them at par with gold, We surely can not be longer needless of tbe burden this imposes upon the people even under fairly prosperous conditions, while the past four years have demon ■'.rated that it is not ouly au expensive charge upon tbe government, bat a dangerous menace to the national ere dll. It is manifest that we mast devise some plan to protect the government against bond issues for rept ated redemp tions. We must either curtail the portunity for speculation made easy the multiplied redempti >ns of our mand obligations, or inceease the gold reserve for their redemption. We have $900,000,000 of currency which the government by solemn enactment has undertaken to keep at par with gold. Nobody is obliged to redeem in gold but the government. The banks are not required to redeem in gold. Tbe government is obliged to keep equal with gold all its outstanding currency and coin obligations, while its receipts are not required to be paid in gold. They are paid in every kind of money but gold, and the ouly means by which tbe government can with certainty, get gold is by borrowing. It can get it no other way wheu it most needs it. - The government without any fixed gold revenue is pledged to maintain gold re demption, which it has steadily and faithfully done and which under the authority now given it will continue to HE Presi Con both Rep It greet of sena been do. The law which requires the govern ment after having redeemed its United States notes to pay them out again as currency funds demands a constaut re plenishment of tbe gold reserve. This is especially so in times of business panic and when the revenues are in sufficient *o meet the expenses of the government. At such times the gov ernment has no other way to support its deficit and maintain redemption but through increase of its bonded debt, as daring tbe administration of my pre decessor when $262,315,400 of four and a half per cent, bonds were issued und sold and t lie proceeds used to pay the expenses of tbe government iu excess of the revenues and sustain the gold While it is true that the con and good our no of to be it of its a is our the The is reserve. greater part of the-»proceeds of these bonds were used to supply deficient re venues, a considerable portion was ie quired to maintain the gold reserve. With our revenues equal to our ex penses there would be no deficit re quirii g the issuanc- of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below $160,000, 000 bow will it be replenished except by selling more bends? Is there any other way practicable under existing laws? Tbe serious question then is, shall we continue the policy that has been pursued in the past, that is when the gold reserve reaches the point of danger, issue more bonds to prevent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve? If no further legislation is had and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued, then Congress should give the Secretary of the Treasury au thority to sell bonds at long or short periods, bearing a less rate of interest than is now authorized by law. I earnestly recommend that as soon as tbe receipts of the government are quite sufficient to pay all the expenses of the government, t liât when any of the United State.- notes are presented for redemption in gold and are re deemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an ob vious duty. If tbe holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from tbe government he should not re ceive back from the government a Ignited States note without paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the government issues an inter est-bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of Uuited States no es a n u-iuterest-bearing debt. Surely it should uo pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out in any other way they may re turn agaiu to be followed by auother bond issue to redeem them— another interest-bearing dtb to redeem a non interest bearing debt. In my view it is of the utmost im portance that the government should be relieved from the burden of provid ing all tbe gold required for exchanges and) export. This responsihili y is alone borne by the government with out )tny of tbe usual and ne-.-essary banking powers to help itself. The banks do not feel thedraiu of gold re demption. The whole strain rests up m tbe government and the size of tbe guld reserve in the Treasury bag come to be, with or without reason, the signal of danger or of security. This ought to be stopped. If we are to bave an era of prosper ity in tbe country, witb sufficient re cepts for tbe exports of the government we may feel no Immediate embarrass ment from our present currency; but tbe danger still exists, and will be ever present, menaoiug as so long as the ex* ing system continues. And besides it is in times adequate revenues aud bu - iness tranquility that the government should prepare for tbe worst. We can not avoid without serious consequences the wise consideration and prompt so lution of this question. Tbe Secretary of the Treasury has sutliued a plan in great detail for tbe purpose of removing tbe threatened re currence of a depleted gold reserve, and a*ve ua from future embarrassment on tfiat account. To Ibis plan I invite y<>nr careful consideration, I concur with tbe Secretary of the us tbe of tbe t>f of ot of r * t'b w#r bo a our for be TjMsury ia his recommendation that national banks be allowed to issue notes to tbe face value of tbe bouds which they bave deposited for cireula tloP, sad that (be tax on circulating gote* secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one-half of one per cent per annum, I also join him recom is tbe mental that authority be given for a This *Ul enable the smaller villages and b** u It ural rations of tbs country with currency to meet meut of national bauks a minimum capital of $95,000. be ««If I recommend that the issue of tioual bank noies be restiicted to op by de gold have the has gold are Tbe get no re the to denomination of ten dullars and up wards.

CUBAN PROBLEM. The most important problem with which this government is now called upon to deal pertaining toits foreign relations concerns its duty toward Spain and the Cuban insurrection. Problems and fconditions more or less in common with those now existing have confronted this government at various times in the past. The story of Cuba for many years has been one of unrest, growing discontent; an effort toward a larger enjoyment of liberty and >elf control; of organized resist ance to tbe mother country; of. depres sion after distress and warfare and of ineffectual settlement to be followed by renewed revolt. For no enduring period since the enfranchisement of the continental possessions of hpain in the Western continent has the condition of Cuba or tbe policy of Spain toward Cuba not caused concern to the United States. Tbe prospect from time to time that tbe weakness of Spain's hold upon the island and the political vicissitudes and embarrassments of tbe home gov ernment might Ik.ch 1 • <> the transfer of Cuba to a continental power called forth, between 1823 and 1860, various emphatic declarations of tbe policy of tbe United States to permit no disturb ance of Cuba's connection with Spain under the direction of independence or acquisition by us through purchase; nor has there been any change of this declared policy since upon tbe part of of the government. The revolution which began iu 1868 lasted for ten yeats, despite the stren uous efforts of the successive penin sular governments to suppiess it. Then, as now, the government of the United States testified its gravs concern and offered its aid to put an end to blood shed iu Cuba. The overtures made by General Grant wete refused, and the war dragged on, entailing great loss of life aLd treasure, and increased in jury to Americau interests, besides throwing enough announced burdens of neutrality upon this government. In 1878 peace was brought about by the truce of Zanjon, obtained by nego tiations between the Spanish com mander Martinez De Campos, and the insurgent leaders. The present insurrection broke out in February, 1895. It is not my pur pose at this time to recall its remark able increase or to characterize its tenacious resistance against the enor mous forces massed against it by Spain. Tbe revolt and the efforts to subdue it carried destruction to every quarter of the island, developing wide proportions and defying the efforts of Spain for its suppression. The civilized code of wir has been disregarded no les3 so by the Spaniards than by the Cubans. The existing conditions cannot but fill this govermeut and the Americau people with the gravest apprehension. Theie is no desire upon tbe part of the people to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have ouly the desire to see the Cu bans prosperous and conteuted, enjoy ing that measure of self-control, which is the inalienable right of man, pro tected in their right to reap the benefit of tiie exiiaustiess treasures of their country.. The offer made by my predecessor in April, 1896, tendering the friendly offices of this government, failed. Any mediation on our part was not accepted. Iu biief the answer read: "There is no effectual way to pacify Cuba unless it begins with tiie actual submission of the rebels to the mother Country." Then only could Spain act iu the promised direction, of her own motion and after her own plans. The cruel policy of concentration was initiated on February 16, 1896. Tiie productive districts controlled by the Spauisli armies were depopulated, The agricultural inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison towns, their lands laid waste and their dwell ings destroyed. Tbe policy of the late Cabinet of Spain justified this as a ne cessary measure of war and as a means of cutting off supplies from the insur gents. It has utterly failed as a war measure. It was not civilized warfare, It was extermination, Against this abuse of tbe rights of war I have felt constrained on repeated occasions to enter tbe firm and earnest protest of this government. There was much of public condemnation of tbe treatment of American citizens by alleged illegal arrests and long im prisonment awaiting trial or pending protected judicial proceedings. I felt it my first duly to make instant de. m«fnd for the release or speedy trial of all American citizens under arrest. Be fore the change' of the Spanish Cabinet in October last, twenty-two prisoners, citizens of the United States bad been given their freedom. For the relief of our own citizens suffering because of the conflict,tbe aid ofCongres8 was sought in a special mes sage, and under the appropriation of April, 4 J897, effect vie aid baa been given to American citizens in Cuba, »any of them at their own request having been returned to tbe United s,at88 - - The instructions given to our new Minister to Spain before his departure for bis post directed him todmpress up on that government tbe sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of tbe war in Cuba by reach ing a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable alike to Spain and as re in as if of is i S-. island; that we could not contemplate an iudeSnite period for the accomplish ment of this result. No solution was proposed to which the «lightest idea of humiliation Spain could attach, and indeed the pre cise proposals were withheld to svoid embarrassment to the government. Ail that was asked or expected was that some Safeway might be speedily provid ed and permanent peace restored.lt has so chanced that the consideration which bad declined the tenders of my prede cessor, and which for more than two years had poured men and treasure into Cuba in the fruitless effort to suppress the revolt, fell to others. Between tbe departure of General Woodford, tbe new envoy, and his arrival iu Spain, tbe statesman who had shaped tbe pol icy of his country fell by the haud an assassin and although the Cabinet of tbe late premier still held office and received from our envoy the proposals he bore, that cabinet gave place within a few days thereafter to a new admin istration under the leadership of Sagas na- to the Cuban people. These the stroctions recited tbe character duration of the content, the widespread losses it entails, the burdens and straints it imposes uponjus, with stant disturbance of national interests and the injury resulting from an finite continuance of this - state thiugs. It was stated that at this junc ture our government was constrained to seriously inquire if tbe time was ripe when Spain, of her own volialion, moved by her own interest and every sentiment of humanity should put stop to this destructive war and make proposals of a settlement honorable herself and just to her Cuban colony. It was urged that as a neighboring tion, with large interests in Cuba, could be required to wait only a reason able time for tbe mother country establish its authority and restore peace and order within tbe borders of up here of re with called foreign less at story of effort liberty resist of the the of that the gov of of or this of 1868 and by the of in by com the out pur its it of its wir the The this Cu pro in not act by late ne war of of by de. of Throughout ail these horrors and dangers to our towu peace this govern- ment has never in any way abrogated its sovereign prerogative of reserving (a itself the determination vl its policy and course according to its own high sense of right and in consonance of with the dearest interests and convic- tions of our own people, should the pro loDgation of the strife so demand, Of the untried measures there mains only; Recognition of Um iu- ta. The reply to our note was received on the 23rd day of October. It in the direction ot a better understanding. appreciates tbe ftiendly purposes this government. It admits that our country is deeply affected by the war in Cuba and that its desires for peace are just. It declares that the present Spanish Government is bound by every consideration to a change of policy that should satisfy tbe United States and pacify Cuba within a reasonble time. To this end Spaiu has decided to put into effect tbe political reforms here tofore advocated by the present premier, without haulting for any consideration in the path which iu its judgment leads to peace. The military operations, is said, will continue, but will be hu maue and will be conducted with all regard for private rights, being accom panied by political action leading toau tomy of Cuba while guauteeiug Span ish sovereignty. This,it is claimed, will result in investing Cuba with a dis tinct personality; the island to be gov erned by an executive and by a local council or chamber, reserving to Spain tbe control of the foreign relations, the army and navy, and the judicial ad ministration. To accomplish this the present government proposes to mod ify existing legislation by decree, leav ing the Spanish Cortes, with the aid of Cuban Senators and Deputies to solve the economic problem and properly dis tribute tiie existing debt. In the absence of a declaration of tbe measures that this government pro poses to take in carrying out its proffer of good offices it suggests that Spain be left free to conduct military opera tions and grant political reforms, while the United States for its part shall en force its neutral obligations aud cut off the assistance which it is asserted tiie insurgents receive from this country. The supposition of an indefi nite prolongation of t ho war is denied. It is asserted that the western provinces are already well nigh reolaimed, that tiie planting of cane and tobacco there in has been resumed and that by force of arms and new aud ample reforms very early and complete pacification is hoped for. The immediate amelioration of ex isting conditions uoder tbe new ad ministration of the Cuban affairs is predicted and therewithal the disturb ances and all occasion for any change of attitude on tbe pa.t of tbe United States. Discussion of the question of international duties and responsibili ties of the United States as Spaiu un derstands them is made with au appar ent disposition to charge us with fail ure in this regard. This charge is without any basis of fact. It could not have been made if Spain had been cognizant of the constant efforts this government has made at the cost of millions and by tbe employment of tbe administrative ministry of the nation at command to perform its full duty according to tbe law of nations. That it has successfully prevented tbe de parture of a single expedition or armed vessel from our shorss in violation of our laws would seem to be a sufficient answer. But of this aspect of the Spanish note it is not necessary to speak further cow. Firm in the conviction of a wholly performed obligation, due response to this charge bas been made iu diplomatic course. re in- a irgents a belligerents; recognition tbe independence of Cuba;neatral tervention to the war by imposing rational compromise between the testants and intervention in favor of one or the other party. I speak of forcible annexation, for that cannot be thought of. That by our code morality would be criminal aggression. Recognition of the belligerency the Cuban insurgents has often been canvassed as a possible, if not inevit able step both it: regard to tbe previous ten years struggle and during tbe pres ent war, I am not unmindful that the two houses of Congress in spring of 1896 expressed the opinion resolution that a condition of public isted requiring or justifying tbe recog nition of state a of belligerency in Cuba and during the extra session the Senate voted a joint resolution of like import, which, however, was not brought to vote in the House of Representatives, In the presence of these significant pressions of the sentiment of the legis lative branch it behooves the executive Turning t o the political aspects of recognition of belligerency and review ing its inconveniences and positive,dan gers still further pertinent considera tions appear. In the code of nations there is no such thing as a naked re cognition of belligerency unaccompan ied by the assumption of international neutrality. Such recognition without more will not confer upon either party to a domestic conflct a status not there tofore actually possessed or affect the relation of either party to other states. The act of recognition usually takes the form of a solemn proclamation of neutrality which recites the defacto conditions of belligenercy as its motive. It announces a domestic law of neu trality in the declaring state. It as sumes the international obligations of a neutral in the presence of a public state of war. It warns all citizens and others within the jurisdiction of the proclaimant that they violate those rigorous obligations at their own peril and.cannot expect to be shielded from the consequences. The right of visit and search on tbe seas and seizure of vessels and cargoes and contraband of war and good prize under admiralty law must under international law be admitted as a legitimate con sequence of a proclamation of belliger ency. While according the equal bel ligerent rights defined by public law to each party in our ports, disfavors would be imposed on both, which while nom inally equal would weigh heavily in be half of Spain herself. Possessing a navy and controlling the ports of Cuba, her maritime rights could be asserted not only for the military investment of the island, but up to the margin of our own territorial, water and a condition of thiugs would exist for which the Cubans within their domain could not hope to create a parallel; while its creation through aid or sympathy from within our domain would be even more impossible that now, with tbe additional obligations of international nedtrality we would perforce assume. The enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would only be influential within our own jur isdiction by land and sea and applicable by our own instrumentality. It could impart to the United States no juris diction between Spain and the insu - gents. It would give tbe United States no right of intervention to enforce tbe conduct of tbe strife within tbe para mount authority of Spain according to the international code of war. For these reasons I regard the rec ognition of the billigerency of the Cu ban insurgents as now unwise and therefore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter be deemed wise as a measure of right and duty the executive will take it. Intervention upon humanitarian grounds has been frequently suggested and has not ^failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration But should such a step be now taken when it is apparent that a hopeful change has supervened in the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new government has taken office in the mother country. It is pledged iu advan ce to the declara tion that all tbe effort in the woild can not suffice to maintain peace in Cuba by the bayonet; that vagne promises of reform after subjugation affected no solution of insular problem; that with a substitution of commanders must come a change of the past system of warfare for one in harmony with a new policy which shall no longer aim to drive thé Cubans to the "horrible alter native of taking to the thicket or suc cumbing in misery;" that reforms must be instituted in accord moe with the needs and circumstauces of the time, and that these reforms w hile designed to give full autonomy to tbe colony and to create a virtual entity and self con trolled administration, shall yet con serve and affirm the sovereignty of re of a to to to soberly consider the conditions under which so important a meas ure needs rest for justification. It to be seriously considered whether the Cuban insurgents possesses beyond dis pute tbe attributes of statehood which alone can demand tbe recognition belligerency in its favor. Possession, in short, of the essential qualifications of sovereignity by the insurgents and the conduct of the war ty them accord ing to the recognized code of war are no less important factors toward the determination of the problem of belli gerency than are the influences and consequences of this struggle upon the internal policy of tbe recognizing state.
