Tho'frionds of Furman University and Groonvillo Fomalo Collcgo in Ooonoo aro pleased to loaru of tho oleotion of 'J.

Tho now hoard contains twonty-llvo mombors, a majority of whom aro laymen of ripe business ox porlonco. Tho oonvontion had a wiso purposo to serve in thoir soloctlou, us matters of vital importanco to tlioso bi ni Hut ions of learning domnnd solution by tho prosont board. Thoso colleges aro very near to thc hearts of thousands of tho host pooplo In our Stato, who look with conlldonco to tho trustees to foster tho highest ofllcioncy and greatest usoful 11088 of these time honored institutions. Wo boliovo that each and oyory member of tho now board will do all that in him is for thc training of tho youth vi h'm church and Stato. Senator MoLnurin on I lie H nee Probien. On our first pago will bo found an in terview of Sonator John L, MoL-aurln, of South Carolina, by tho Washington Post, on tho race problem. It is a masterly analysis of tho conditions prevailing in tho South, and furnishes a lucid and cogent explanation of tho causes which lcd up to tho rccont conflicts in North nud South Carolina. Always strong and forceful in tho expression of his viows on any public question, Senator McLaurin in this instance even surpasses himself in laying baro tho basic principles involved, and giving to tho pooplo of tho North a calm, true presentation of tho facts in tho caso. Tho Washington Post, ono of tho greatest and most influential dailies pub lished on tbe continent, shares his views in tho main, and has risen above tho sen timent of party or section in its treat ment of the recent, troubles between tho races in tho Sou tb. Tho Baptist State Convention nud its I md ii ni ions of Lcnruiug. At tho convention at Darlington Fur man University and tho Groonvillo Fo malo Collcgo carno in for a largo share of attention. Dr. A. P. Montague, tho Pre sident of Furman University, is a manly man, ono well prepared and lltted for tho position to which he has been called hy tho Baptists of tho Stato. By his genial mannors ho has captivated tho Baptists of tho Stato and so ingratiated himself into tho conlldonco of his pupils that each regards bim moro as a companion and friend than othorwiso. They ma ko him thoir confidential advisor and friend. Dr. Montague's address to tho convention in tho interest of tho work confided to bis caro was wo\\ received by his brethren. A now Board of Trustees for Furman University and tho Greenville Fomalo College was selected, as given else where in our columns, and this Board resolved to exert it? best endeavors to advance tho interests of tho colleges. Tho Board fools that all that is necessary to tho comploto success of tho collcgos is to hold up tho hands of thoir ofiieers. Wo now havo 170 pupils undor Dr. Montaguo, and noxt year wo earnestly hope to double this number. If tho number of students is to bi doubled tho college must havo moro room for their entertainment. , Tho authorities havo now in contem plation tho erection of a new building, tho Alumni Hall. Already a considera ble sum has been subscribed for its build ing, but a sufficient amount for its com pletion is not in sight. Tho eollogo au thorities aro now petitioning tho Baptists of tho Stato to help in this ontorpriso, and to this omi tho junior editor of tho COUKIKK expects, in tho near future, to visit tho various sections of tho Beaver dam Association and prosont tho claims of tho college. Tho Stato of South Carolina, now raises for tho Stato collcgos botwoou $125,000 and $175,000 annually to defray tho exponaos of thoso institutions. Thoso Stato colleges do not offer any higher standard of learning than tho denominational colloges, and, thoreforo, cannot justly claim tho special favor of support by taxation. Wo mako this prediction: That in tho near futuro ibis taxation must cease, or bo greatly cur tailed. The signs of tho times indicate that a Conflict between tho Stato and denomi national colleges is imminent. Tho con troversy can, and wc think will bo, Bot tled without detriment to thoso InnMt.it. lion:, that furnish to tho young mon and women of tho Stato tho opportunity of acquiring industrial and special training.

Two Pointed Questions Answered? What is tho uso of making a hotter arti cle than your competitor if you cannot. get a hotter pi ico for it? Ans. As thoro is no difference in tito prico tho publie will buy only tho hotter, so that while our profits may ho smaller on a singlo salo they will ho much greater in tho aggregate. Dow can you get thc public to know your make is tho best? If both artielos aro brought promi nently before tho publie both aro certain to bo tried, and" tho public will vory quickly pass judgment on thom and uso only tho hottor ono.
