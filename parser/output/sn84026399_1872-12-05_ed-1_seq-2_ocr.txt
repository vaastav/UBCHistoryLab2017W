The yonug gen tleman and ladies who run the schools throughout this County, met in convention, at the Court House, lust week, under the call of their Superintendent, Mr. Frutehey, of this borough. The session lasted for several days, and was well attended by Teachers and citizens. The exercises, from day to day, were very interesting and instruc tive. It would do any one good to see the interest taken by the gentlemen and Lady teachers of the youth of our County in the convention and its exercises. Three Lectures were delivered. The 1st by John Savage, Esqr., subject, "Gen. Montgomery." The second by Prof. Seldin J. CofBn, subject '"California and the Territories" and the third by Hon. John B. Storm, subject "The Limit3 and Tendencies of Modem Sciences," each lecture was well attended and received marked attention. The premium for spel ling, consisting of a gold pen and pencil, was awarded to Miss A. Cross, a teacher of this borough, a compliment well merrited. There is no charge fur showing goods at Fried's, neither are there cross looks if you do not bu TIiakKgli Jii. We are pleased to be able to notice that this day was appropriate ly observed in our Borough. Our Stores were closed, business suspended, with a few exceptions too small to notice. Service was held in the Lutheran Church, where a good discourse was delivered by the Rev. Mr, Dinsmore. The service was well atten ded. The Teachers' Institute held a scssiou in the evening when the lion. John B. Storm dehVcred a lecture subject "Limits and Ten dencies of Modern Sciences." He did the subject full justice. The Court House was crowded, and all seemed to enjoy the lecture. In the evening a Ball came off at the Lackawanua House, East Stroudsburg. Several of our citizens were there, and enjoy ed themselves much. Turkey, Chicken, Oysters and trimmings suffered. Our Hotels and Saloons were open, and dispensed, in small potions, the O B-joyful during the day. iSonc seemed to suffer much.

At about 11 o'clock on Monday nifiht, the people of our tovsn were startled he thn nnnnllincr crv of Fire. The wind at J 1 1 C3 the time was blowing a perfect huricane and this, with the brilliancy of the illumination caused by the flames of the burning building created genuine consternation among many of our citizens, who saw nothing in it but the destruction of the entire lower end o town a miniature Chicago or Boston cala mity. Upcn following the crowd, we reached the spot, and found the burning building to be that occupied by M. L. Phillips as a Candy and Oyster Saloon. When we got tliere things did look very squally indeed, but the Steamer Poeono was promptly on hand, and though there was some awkward ness on the part of the fireman growing out of want of discipline and practice, she soon rr,s in M-i-ii-t- in.l cmn tnl.f '.vitli Ullirxr nfTrf,t upon the Src. In ten minutes after leaving the Engine House, the Engineer, notwith standing a run of nearly' four blocks, had one, and, in twelve minutes, two streams on the Gre, and in thirty minutes the fire was so completely squelched, that hardly a spark could be seen. There has always existed some prejudice against the Poeono, mainly growing out of the great cost, but the fire of Monday night has wiped out all this, aud ; 11 now not a property holder here would be without it. The result of the fire was the destruction of the front of the building oc cuiiicd by M. L. Phillips. His loss is covered by an insurance iu the Monroe Mutual of sSOO on stock. Ihe buildmg belonged to John Boys, on which was an insurance of $'200 in the same company. Dr. William u a Ron s new three story vrick house was considerably damaged-probably to the extent of $'600. We have not heard whether there was any insurance on this. When first dis covered the fire had complete mastery ofthe whole inside of Mr. Phillips, store, Prof. John II.

At six o'clock od WeJnesdav morninir a fire was discovered in the attic of the Lackawanna Valley House ou Lackawanna avenue, owned by Capt. Jacob Robinson of New York, and occupied by John Baldwin late of Stroudsburg. The exact cause of the fire is unknown. The various fire companies were soon on the ground, and by their exertions the fire wa conuoed to the building, aud part of that saved. The walls are all stand ing, aud can probabaly be used again.

City Journal. Soldiers' Homesteads. Ihe Land Department of the Northern Pacific Railroad gives notice that there are abundant government lands, of the very finest quality, along the line of that road in Central Miunesota, which are open to settlements a3 free homesteads. Lands of this character near to railroads are now comparatively scarce in the West.

The number of soldiers' orphans un der the care of the State has undergone no diminution the past four years, the places of those leaving the schools by rea son of having arrived at the prescribed age of sixteen years or other causes be ing filled by others old enough to claim admission. In the year 1868, 1869, 1870 and 1871 between 3,600 and 3,700 or phans were educated and supported un der the law providing for the establish ment of the Soldiers' Orphans' Depart ment, aod during the current year the number has been about the same. The monthly admissions reach from thirty five to forty. The yearly expenses of the State in keeping up the orphan school system amounts to from 8150,000 to 8550,000, which sum will probably be greatly reduced within the next two or three years, and in the course of five or six years the number of ornhano will have become so small as to render the department created for their benefit un necessary.

That was the work that his strong hands and brave heart and wise brain were set to do, and that was the work that under a hem (ii-ent Provi dencc they accomplished.

There is uo American journalist, sin cercly honoring the profession of journa lism, who will not nod in the announce ment of the demise of Horace Greeley cause for the profouodest regret; there is no American citizen honoring the lives oi those who have made the country strong and great who can regard the death ol Horace Greeley with auy feeling insepar able from sorrow. He was the head aud front of wise, re liable, honest journalism ; he was the first of living journalists. He was a states man, a patriot and a humanitarian. A great man : great in his wisdom, in his honesty, in his devotiou to his fcllowmen At the last, an unsuccessful man. Pos sibVy. But who can say that ? The ambi tion of his last days was honorable to him as it was honorable to his country, that a man who had fought his own way from abject poverty to such aspirations as hi had been born to and reared by it. There was no dishonor in his failing to reach the goal for which he tried. He made his best endeavor, and haviog done that he could have waited had he lived, and now being dead his memory can wait, for the wise future to decide whether he wn right or wrong in seeking to be President We cannot praise such a man. What he has done puts to shame the weaknes of what we may say. Iu his "Recollec Hons of a Busy Life" he said that be would like, aftcr he was gone away to hi rest, to have it remembered that he es tablished the Tribune. That was to keep his memory green among his country men. He might also have said to kee it always in grateful reverence. Like al men who do their work well, no matter what their work may be, he knew that he bad done his well, and in his wise sincerity he asked that he might be kept in recollection by it. lo appreciate it all, we must recognize the services t', country and to mankin that the journal be founded did durin the thirty-one busy years in which he made its policy and controlled its affairs lhere was no reform suggested that il seemed wise to him to favor that he di not favor in the columns of the Tribune there was no improvement projected foi .1 i ine mechanical department of a great newspaper which was not given a trial in the mechanical department of the Tri bune ; there was no public enterprise, no scheme ot charity or Christianity planned lor the good of mankind that wast not helped by the Tribune ; there was no que.'tiou of politics or statecraft that it not fairly and intelligently discuss, and, whil it neglected no minor issues of the time during all the period of its existence, it fought slavery with such power, skill and honesty, that slavery was abolished, and by no means more surely than by the in uignant protest ot humanity created against it by the Tribune.

His editorial utterances bristled with thought and fact, and, how ever they may have erred in judgment, they still commanded attention by reason ol their author's established integrity of purpose. He was too pure a statesman to be a good politician, too frank a man to command the sympathy or support ol partisans. He placed great reliauce up on the honesty of others, and was often deceived by them. But unto the last he kept his simple faith in the truth of man kind In his death journalism has lost its ablest representative, the country an honesty, wise patriot, humanity a true friend. From The Xcio-York Bulletin. No event since the death of Abraham Lincoln has so deeply touched the na tion's heart. Mr. Greelay was greater in his political defeat than most men are in their greatest victory. lie astonished his warmest friends and disarmed the resentment of his opponeuts by the marvellous eloquence and in tcllcctual resources of this speeches dur ing the politiacl campaign which none could have anticipated whould prove only a campaign of death. His brain, always worked to its highest tension, could not endure the enormous additional strain ; and this, continued with the demands on his always power ful emotional nature, proved too niach lor even his robust constitution. - The news of his death produced a deep and unusual sense of personal loss and bereavement ; for the individuality of the man was enormous, and was contstantly manifested in all his writings and speech es. He died in the full meridian of his powers, and when he still seemed to have a fut ure before him worthy of, and com meo8urate with, his past career. We may criticise this or that particular act of his life, or wish that he had adopted a dif ferent line in certain matters of public policy. But the time has not yet come to fix his true place in history. For an entire generation, he bore a prominent part in the great events that attracted the atten- tiori cf his countrymen and of mankind. And it is scarcely too much to amrm that, saving only Washington and Jeffer son, no single American had made a deep er, broader mark on his country s history than Horace Greeley. The future of every child that may be henceforth born in our country will be more or less affect ed because of this oue man that has pass ed away from us to be seen no more for ever. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. A calmer, more dispassionate Message than that which we publish this mormnr, rom the President of the United btafes to the National Congress, has never be fore issued from the hite House. Its suggestions are few, its recommendations not many. It couveys rather by repres sion than expression the future policy of the Administration, for, as it points to no new paths, the inference is that the old ones are to be followed. In manner it lacks nothing that is indispensable, and the matter of it is excellent. If the country were a vast estate, hav ing outside and inside dealings with its near and distant neighbors, and the Prcsi dent were the steward of it all, just such a document as this Message he would be likeyly to send to his em poly er at the vear a end. as a compendium oi ine t 1- i ri country a history, of its dailv doings, ol its relations with its foreign and domestic neighbors, of the condition of its army navy, and civil departments it is simply exhaustive as concise and satisfactory a state paper as was ever submitted lo the nation. The tone of it all is one of remaikable quietness, and it is only when it refers to the Cuban revolution and the continuance of slavery upon that island by Spain that it warms with the importance of the sub ject. But even then, the I'rcsidcut is critic, not a partisan. In connection wiih Mexico the Mcsag states very distinctly the condition f that country, and refers dispassionately to the difficulties which exist between it and the the United States, resulting from lawlcs depredations committed upon our citizen upon the border ; but, beyond recommend inir an appropriation for the Commission to continue its existing examinations inti the cases of claimants against Mexico nothing is suggested. The Presb'ent cites the report of th Secretary of the Treasury to show that during the last year, our ocean -carryin trade has most rapidly decreased, and h very earnestly commends the whole mat tcr to the immediate attention of Congress lie xcpresses his belief that an expendi ture of four or five millions of dollars by the country for the purpose of re estab lishing our merchant marine will money well spent. be The Message shows the President to be in hearty sympathy with the Postmaster General in regard to the evils of the franking privilege, and, in connection with the proposition made by Mr. Cres well to incorporate the lelegraph witl the Postal Department, the Picsident re commends to Congress the appoiutment of a commision to t;ike into consideration in what manner the government may best secure the existing telegraph Hues now owned by corporations. It will, there fore, be seen that, in this matter also, the President, is fully committed to the plans of the Postmaster General. In speaking of the quiet, yet rapid decay of our navy, the Message tersely put this serious business into language so plain thut every one must understand "It is evident," says the President, "That "unless steps arc taken to preserve our "navy, in a very lew ycar3 the United "States will be the weakest nation upon "the ocean of all the great Powers." The subsequent recommendation that he makes upon the subject Congress cannot well afford to disreg-ird. There is one suggestion that the Presi dent makes which will be likely to awaken widespread interest. It is that iu which he advises the examination of a practica ble route of "an almost continuous Innd locked navigation from Maine to the Gull of Mexico." To this suggestion we especially call the attention of our readers The Indian question occupies a large part of the Message, but it is a question that has been very emphatically settled long ago in favor of the President's peace policy. In regard to the Centennial Celebra tion, the President docs not, as we antici pated he would do, recommend to Con gress the propriety of making an ap propiation sufficient to insure its success He refers to its importance and to the interest it will create, and there he ends the subject. What every one, who is not merely a politician, will be glad to hear, is, that the President means to enforce the Civil Service rules, in order to render the service as excellent as possible. Tho foregoing are the principal points in the President's very exhaustive and satisfactory Message. Inquirer. We are grati6ed to be able to announce that Thiers aud the French Assembly arc at peace once more. The irate Pre sident has yielded to the proposition to have a responsible ministry, and be par tially excluded from debate. This is a considerable concession on his part, and is duly appreciated, and peace may there fore be said to bo established. The effect of his exclusion from debate will be to secure greater harmony of action, as it will operate to remove the disturbing cause Thier'a asperity of manner. So all's well that ends well.

Where the Nickel Comes From Few people are aware that the niikcf, from which our smaller coins are math; of, comes from a single mine, which is t,e only one in the country that i now Icing worked This mine is situated in Lin caster, Pa. It has been worked lor seven teen years, and developed to the depth '100 ftet. The length of lode is between two and three thousand feet, and it pro duces from four hundred to six hundred tons per month employing in the woik ing ofthe mino a force ol 175 men. In the arts, nickel is rapidly growing int lavar as a substitute lor silver in rilatin steel, iron and other metals. Its com mercial demand is rapidly increasing, and as it js much cheaper than silver it will undoubtedly be adopted in the manufac facture of many articles as a substitute for the more precious metal.
