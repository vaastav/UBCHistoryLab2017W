"Washing of Dociocra'lc linen for amusement of Republicans," as Mr. Williams ft put it Monday, occupied the attention of the house for more than two houis today. The result accompllsh- ft ed was a "deli" thrown at the uiiirrity leader by Representative Lamar, of Florida, and another by Ropre- ft sentatue Shacklefotd, of Missucr. The complaint of both resulted from failure of Mr. Williams to rec- ft ommend their reappointment as mi iUktb of the committee on inter-state and foreign commerce. Both of ft tho gentlemen made long sivecbes, in which Mr. Williams' leadership was assailed from many points. Mr. ft Williams replied to Mr. Lamar at sjn length and to Mr. Shackelford briefly. His defense was that at the ft last session the Democrats en this cjiumltiee were divided, and he deemed it necessary for the good of tho ft party and the country that a united minority report should be made on the subject of railroad rate legisla- ft tlon. At times there was high tcn&ion in tho dehate. Mr. Lamar was particularly bitter in his criticism ft of Mr. Williams, and openly declared that his heretofore personal friendship for Mr. Williams was forever- ft at an end unless the criticism of himself was retracted. ft The subject under discussion was the committee distribution of the annual message of President Roose- ft velt.

It is tho opinion in well informed circles here thai it will be; impossible to pass a statehood bill tbls sesssion aamiuing Arizona and New Mexico as one state, and that it will be certainly impossi ble to pass such a bill without giving the people of Arizona the opportunity of voting on it separately. The citizens of the territory should not be fooled and alramed by the Statements Issuqd and Inspired by Senator Beverldge. All the mem bers of the Tawney party who visited the territories last fall are working hard against joint statehood and It is believed that tho Hamilton bill will be killed in the house by the Republi can vote alone.

That the de nial of separate statehood for Arizona and New Mexico is sought to bo ef fected through the desire of eastern politicians to restrict western rcpre-, sentation in tho Congress is more, Chamber of Commerce Will Protest Against Joint Statehood Tonight an important meeting of the BIsbee Chamber of Commerce will be held at the office of Frank J. Graf. Owing to the dangerous aspect for the passage of the Hamilton Joint State hood bill at the -present session of Congress, It is the intention of the Chamber of Commerce to draft strong resolutions protesting against the pas sage of the bill and wire resolutions to our Delegate in Congress. The Review understands that a sim jlar meeting will be held in Douglas tonight. Besides this important mat ter at the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce this evening, Mr. W. P. McNair, one of the vice-presidents ot the organization, will offer an amend ment to the by-laws reducing the membership fee from $25 to. $10, and as it will be necessary for a two thirds vote in order to carry the amendment, a full attendance of all members who have signed the mem bership roll is requested. The membership roll of the Bisbec Chamber of Commerce Is as follows: J. T. Hood, W. B. Glvens, W. II Brophy, Gerald Sherman, J. M. O'Con nell, Frank Graf, E. A. Tovrea. J. J. Eowen, M. L. Naquin, W.

The .fate of Oklahoma and Indian Territory is thus made to depend upon the fate of the Arizona and New Mexico proposition which is antagonized both in the territories and in Congress. The Post adds: "The plan to unite Oklahoma and Ilndian Territory was first suggested by Senator Beveridge. It is uncomprehensible that he should thus impede the enactment of legis lation carrying his plan into effect by insisting- upon the jointure or tne two territories -which object to being" joined and which is open to serious objection In Congress.

HEABST LOSES POINT COURT REFUSES TO ORDER RE OPENING OF BALLOT BOXES. New York. Dec. 13. The court of appeals today decided the case brought by the attorneys of W. R. Hearst, municipal ownership candi date for mayor, to compel the opening of the ballot boxes and a recount of the ballots. The opinion was to the effect that under the law no one was authorized to open the boxes. The opinion will result in the office of mayor going to McCIellan, the Dem ocratic candidate, for the present, but the attorneys for Hearst will prob ably take the case to the highest court before abandoning their contentions. o i Chicago, Dec 13. The federal grand jury in this city has returned indictments against the-vChicago and Alton railroad company, John M. Faithhorn, the former vice president of the company, and J. A.

HARRIMAN SILENT ON RYAN TESTIMONY. New York, Dec 13. H. E. Harriman last night refused to comment on the testimony of j Thomas F. Ryan before the insurance commission, wherein the witness said Harriman at- tempted to secure an interest in Hyde's Equitable holdings. He replied that he had noth- ing to say. . G. E. Buxton, Carl Behn, Howell Glv ens, J. L. Boston, Jos. Hinckley. From expressions heard among members who will make it a point to be present at the meeting this even ing it is very likely that the amend ment to th by-laws will carry and the membership fee be reduced from $25 to $10, and perhaps a smaller amount. The directors have discovered that the first Idea of a $25 membership fee is not popular, and as it Is in the intention of the organiza tion to securo as representative a mom-' bcrship as possible, it has been tbo consensus of opinion that the member-; ship fee should be reduced. The adoption of strong resolutions protesting against the passage of the joint statehood bill is an important matter that needs immediate atten tion, and it Is hoped that as many as possible will be present at the meet-! lug ui iut Vjuuiauur mis evening at inc office of Fra.nk Graf. I IS Leader-Announcement "Nick" Longworth stated frankly by several eastern con gressmen, this unworthy and un statesmanlike move should be concen trated for the purpose of exacting a square deal. If partisan politics Is behind the ob jectionable: double jointed statehood bill, this' also should be "understood. An honorable, jusl and prompt meth od of disposing of the statehood ques tion would be to chop the statehood bill square in two. enabling Congress to deal with Oklahoma and Indian Territory as one proposition, and Ari zona and New Mexico as another. There is no reason in justice or com mon sense why the fate of Oklahoma should be linked with the fate of New. Mexico. "t" Is "perfectly apparent that if Congress could Tote upon the' "distinct and .separate proposal toadf mil Uklanoma and Indian Territory it would do so by overwhelming ma jority. Why, then, this paltering and juggling in an endeavor to pre vent the honest and open vote?" Is Found in an Old Assessment Hole Near Naco The dead body of an American was discovered yesterday about 2 o'clock where it had been thrown into an old assessment hole about a half mile till. side of the pump house of the BIsbee Naco Water company at Naco. That the man was murdered is evi denced by a gunshot wpund In the back, tearing a large hole from which buckshot was extracted yesterday by the examining physician. There is absolutely no clue so far as to his identity, other than that he was an American, large in stature, with heavy aarK nair. ozessed in a black coat and trousers, no vest, a white shirt, cellu loid collar with a small readymadc DiacK bow tie, white cloth low cut shoes, and -tan socks. From the appearance of the bodv the man had evidently met death two months ago, and his body concealer in the old assessment hole until yes- tercay, wficn a passer-by was attracted to the scene by the awful stench. The justice of the peace at Naco was at once notified, and Judge Greaves summoned to coroner's jury and repaired to the spot, after firsi notifying Bowen &. Hubbard, undertak ers, of this city, who sent out the dead wagon and the body was brought to BIsbee for burial. When the coroner's jury arrived at the scene it was only by tho use of dis infectants that they were able to ex amine the body. The face was liter ally eaten away by magots and other parts of the body were more or less decayed. A careful investigation failed to show any marks of identifica tion, and the pockets in the clothing were iJKewlsc empty. After viewing the body the coron er's jury returned to Naco and ren dered a verdict that an unknown man had come to his death from the effects o fa gunshot wound administered In tho back by parties or party to tbem unknown. After the body was brought to BIs bee another examination was made for fame clue that would lead to identifica tion, but nothing -was- found. That a cold-blooded murder was committed is the opinion of the' officers, bu there has been no one reported missing, and It is the thoory of the officers that the' 

DEAD BODY MASSES ARE AROUSED Capture Forts Command ing Riga Harbor and Imprison Officials GENERAL UPRISING Strike Situation is Clearing andPremierWiiteSees His Way Clear St. Petersburg, Dec. 13. Two mes sengers who arrived here from Riga today not only confirms the report that a provisional government has been set up in LIvernia, but they say that many of the troops have gone over to the in surrectionists. Divanfort. command ing the Riga harbor, is in their posses sion, and the governor and other Rus sian officers are prisoners. There 13 a general uprising of native peasants who are traveling in armed bands, at tacking estates and driving off or kill ing, their owners. The position of the peasants in these provinces has been the most deplora ble of any in tho empire Conditions almost approaching those of the feudal system have been continued to the present time. Russian officials are be ing expelled from the provinces, and many of them have been killed in the streets of the towns. There i6 a reign of terror at Riga. Boston, Dec. 31. Leon Jacob Slor- rlene, an educated Russian Jew, of Odessa, who has arrived here from Russia, says that 15,000 Jews were killed in thre days, with most terri ble mutilation and torture. The Cos sacks aided the mobs in the deadly work, and men, women and children were among the victims. St. Petersburg, Dec. 13. The out look is clearing and there is a fight ing chance that Premier Wltte will yet be able to steer his way through the rocks that beset his path. The threat of a general strike in the immediate future has disappeared, and the telegraph strike, not being supported, is going to pieces. At Moscow the-tie-up remains com plete, but at many other places com munication has been reopened. The situation In the Baltic prov inces is now the most grave in the empire. It approaches civil war, and the government has been forced to appoint a governor general with sweeping powers to try to restore or der. TALKlNp

KANSAS BEING ROBBED THAT IS THE CHARGE MADE IN SPEECH LAST NIGHT BY GOVERNOR HOCH. Ottawa, Kan., Dec. 13. Governor Hoch in a speech here last night at a gathering of Republicans said: "At this time the Kansas oil fields are yielding 60,000 barrels of oil per day, an insignificant part of their ca pacity, and for this oil, the Standard Oil Company, which sets the price, is paying less than one-third what it paid a year ago. I believe it could pay $1 per barrel more for this oil than it is paying and still make a large profit. In other words it is rob hlng the people of $60,000 per day, or 1222,000,000 per year." o - ' CIVIL WAR VETERAN DIES AT OSHKOSH. Oshkosh, Dec. 13. General Thomas S.
