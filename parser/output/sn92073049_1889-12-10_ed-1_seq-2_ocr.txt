THE FIFTY-FIRST CONGRESS. CONGRESS met and organized on Monday, the 2d instant, by the election of Republican officials, with out any serious departure from the programme as. laid down by the Re publican caucus, the only breakage being the defeat of Rev. Dr. Rams dell, the caucus nominee for Chaplain, by Chaplain Milburn, the blind Demo cratic preacher, who has held the position? for the past several years. Dr. Milburn is exceedingly popular and much beloved by the members of the House, and the generosity of the Republicans in re electing him to his old position is highly commend able in them. Speaker Reed (of Maine) made a short speech of thanks for the honor conferred upon him, which, it is said, was not half so long as the usual opening prayer of the Chaplain. The vote for Speaker was as follows: Reed, 165; Carlisle, 154; and 1 for Amos Cummings, of New York, cast by Representative Cowles, of North Carolina, who found it im. possible to vote for Mr. Carlisle on account of some action of his during the last Congress. Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania, was too ill to be present at the opening of the session, and it is not stated when he will be likely to be able to attend. In the Senate, interest on the floor was devoted largely to the Senators from the new States. They had had seats assigned to them on the Repub lican side of the chamber. Senator Casey, of North Dakota, took his seat On the end of the second row, against the north wall. Directly behind him sat the Washington Senators, Allen and Squire, while Pettigrew and Moody, of South Dakota, were in the fourth row, nearer the centre of the room. Senator Pierce, of North Da . kota, has the end seat in the fourth f row, but he was not present Monday. On the Democratic side are two seats so far unassigned. They will be oc cupied by the Senators from Montana when they shall have been chosen. Flowers adorned the desks of many Senators. The desk of Vice-President Morton was . likewise handsomely adorned. At noon Vice President Morton entered the chamber, and the Chap, lain, Rev. T. G. Butler, opened the proceedings with .an invocation for the divine blessing, closing with the Lord's prayer, in which the venerable Senator Edmunds joined audibly . The oath of office was then adminis tered to the new Senators by the Vice-President, their credentials be ing undisputed. - And thus, on Mon day, the 2d inst., the Fifty-first Con gress of the United States of Amer ica was organized for the transaction of business 

JEFFERSON DAVIS. WE clip from the New Orleans States the following touchiugly pathetic reference to the much belovtc ex-Confederate Chieftain, the Hon Jefferson Davis, who has been lying critically ill in thecitv of New Orleans for some davs oast. - It breathes the sentiment of the whole South, whose supplications ascend to a throne o grace in behalf of this grand old man: " During the oast few davs a sren eral and painful but tender interest throughout the whole. South, and especially in New Orleans, has been "varou m me news irom ine resi dence of our eminent fellow citizen, Judge E. C. Fenner, where lies, pros trated wijli a severe, God grant it may not be a mortal illness, the vener able and illustrious Chief of the South ern Confederacy. Every Southern, heart, and millions throughout the Union, beat in sympathy for this" great and good man; and the first question asked, when the morning papers, and again when the' afternoon papers ap pear on the streets is, " How is Mr. Davis ?" Mr. Davis is a very old man but he has an indomitable will, and he is surrounded by family and friends, and every comfort that human love and devotion can command. He must know, too, that the veterans of the Southern armies the Southern youth who have grown up since the war, to love and revere his name, and all the noble women of the South, are in spirit at his bedside; and in such a thought itself there is a life giving power; hence we trust and believe the old chieftain, honored, revered and beloved, wijl. be spared to. his people yet a few years longer." p. s. we are pamea t j state that since the above was put in type news has been received of the death of this great Southern patriot. Mr. Davis s death occurred at 12:45 Friday morn, ing, in the 81st year of his age., He was born June 1, 1808, in Christian county, Ky., graduated at West Point 1828, served as lieutenant of infantry at Western posts 1828-33, of First Dragoons as adjutant 1833 34, and on irontier service j$4. A.iter re signing June 30, 1835, he became a cotton planter in Warren county, Mjss., 1835-46, presidential elector from Mississippi, member U. S. House of Representatives 1845-46, colonel First Mississippi Rifle Volunteers m the war with Mexico 1846-47, en gaged at Monterey and Buena Vista (severely wounded), member of the U. S. Senate 1847-51, and chairman of the committee on military affairs 1849-51, secretary of war in Presi dent Pierce's cabinet 1853-57, mem. ber of the U. S. Senate and chairman committee on military affairs 1857-61, President of the Southern Confeder acy Feb. 4, till captured May 10, 1865; at Irwin ville, Ga., prisoner of war 1865-67 at Fort Monroe, Va. He was released on bail, and finally set free in 1868; wrote " Rise and Fall of the Southern Confederacy." He has crossed the river and rests beneath the shade with his comrades who have gone before. In reviewing his life and character the South finds nothing of which to be ashamed, but everything to inspire respect and affection. The grand and dignified manner with which he has demeaned himself since the close of the war has stamped him a hero of the noblest ype. Amidst his most severe trials and afflictions no supplicating com plaints have been heard to escape his lips, but he has been as brave as he has been honorable and conscientious, and his name will be honored and revered by the people of this goodly and throughout all time. Requiescat tn pace. THE 

SOUTH OUGHT TO SPIN ALL HER COTTON. A PROMINENT Philadelphia cot ton spinner recently visited Al bany, Ga., for the purpose of looking into the advantages offered by that section for such industries. He said to an interviewer: "There is no use in disguising: the fact that the South is the place for cotton manufacturing. You can save in every way and on every side. To si&rb wim, an uuiiuing material is cheaper lumber, brick, etc. Then labor is far less expensive. We would need a few skilled operatives at first at least, then the home people could be quickly taught. They would make splendid workers, and in addition to costing less than at the North, it would be a great help to the worthy poor, where living appears so much cheaper than with us. I see it stated that the colored people of the new generation make better operatives, as a class than the Canadians, Swedes or the natives of New England. They learn very rapidlv and the young people quickly become very skill fuL The great saving here is made in freights. A still greater saving in this respect ' could be made if a public ginnery was added to the industry and cotton bought in natural state. All expenses for jackmg, bag ging, etc., could thus be dispensed with. Twills and satines would doubtless be remuneratively made ncio. x ii ii us aiiu more expensive goods would hardly pay as yet owing to the vast capital employed in this class of manufacture at Fall River and similar large centres. There is great competition in prints, and, of course, the handsomest designs always sell, while those factories which hap pen not to have goods which strike the popular fancy go to the wall. The best paying industry here Vould be the manufacture of yarns. I would guarantee that all the varns manufac tured here of certa n number could be sold on arrival in the city of Philadel phia. The South ought to spin all her cotton into yarn and shir it in that form not only to the North, but w .njngiana and other foreign ports." The number of Farm in the State of North Carolina, up to December the 7th, was two thousand 3 a1 a. a ana ininy-iwo. .ir x A DECISION FAVORABLE TO THE FARMER. ON the 29th ult. Patent Commis sioner Mitchell, at Washington, rendered a decision in the expar:e case of Sigmund Odenheimer, in which was involved " the applicant's rights to a patent for the use of cot ton as a baling fabric. In this;' case the Commissioner' saysi " The' most conspicuous change made by the inventor to produce his alleged invention was the substitution of cotton for jute in the manufacture of bagging. The applicant urged that cotton was specially adapted for use in such manufacture because, unlike jute, it is not highly inflamable, nor brittle, inelastic or rough, and that it can commercially compete with jute, notwithstanding its greater cost. He further claims that . the- discovery of its value for such was the, result of long experiment, attended y large expense . in ascertaining how . the threads should be' spun with a great deal of twist so as to give ' uniform smoothness and hardness and lightness in weight, and also that he found it necessary to omit the sizing process, which diminished the elasticity of the threads." The commissioner, following the re ce a (decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Brown vs. the District ,of Columbia, where the alleged invention in pavement consisted in the substitu tion of specially shaped w6od blocks, laid and filled in a certain way, for blocks of stone-, held that notwith standing the advantages by the alleged invention and the commercial success it had received, the applicant had, in substituting one material for another, only availed himself of the resources and knowledge of the weaver's art; that the experiment and ' trials prac ticed by him were merely along the lines suggested by skill and experi ence pertaining to the calling involv ing the intelligent manipulation of materials, and the supposed invention was not a creative work of the inven tive faculty which the laws contem plated to encourage and reward. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. PRESIDENT HARRISON'S mes sage, a voluminous document, containing more than twenty -five thousand words, was sent to Congress on Monday, the 2d instant, at noonr and was read before both Houses. While the document is not tobe com pared with the able state papers of the late President Cleveland, still it displays much thought and research and makes many practical suggestions. Of course, as was to be expected, it is intensely Republican, not withstand ing he essays to be liberal. We have only spice to make a few extracts, for this issue of The Pbogbessive Fabmib. The President startsout with the usual statement of the condition of our foreign relations, of which he says: - "Good will and cordiality have characterized our relations and cor. respondence with other governments, and the year just closed leaves few international questions of importance remaining unadjusted. No obstacle is believed to exist that can long post pone the consideration and adjust ment of the still pending questions upon satisfactory and honorable terms. The dealings of this government with other states have been, and should al ways be, marked by frankness and sincerity, our purpose avowed and our methods free from intrigue. This course has borne rich fruit in the past, and it is our duty as a nation to preserve the heritage of good re pute which a century of right dealing witn ioreign governments has secured to us. Within our own borders a general condition of prosperity prevails. The harvests of the last summer were ex ceptionally abundant, and the trade conditions now prevailing seem to promise a successful season to the merchant and manufacturer and gen eral employment to our working peo pie," Of the surplus, Mr. Harrison says: "lhe existence of so large an actual'and anticipated surplus should have the immediate attention of Con gress, with a view to reducing the re ceipts oi tne Treasury to the needs of the government as closely as may be. xne collection oi moneys not needed for public uses imposes an unnecessary ouraen upon ner people, and the pres ence of so large a surplus in the pub lic vault is a disturbing element in tne conduct of private business. It has-called into use expedients for put ting money into circulation , of very questionable propriety." The loaning of public funds to the banks, without interest upon the se curity of government bonds, I regard as an unauthorized and dangerous ex pedient. They now practically get interest both upon the bonds and their proceeds. No further use should be made of this method of getting the surplus into circulation, and the de posits now outstanding should V be gradually withdrawn and applied to i i . i . . iuo purcnase oi Donas. Of the tariff, he savs: T recom mend a revision of our tariff law both in its administrative features and in the schedules. The need of the former is generally conceded, and an agree ment upon the evils and inconvenien ces to be remedied and the best meth ods for their correction will probably not be difficult. Uniformity of valu: tion at all our ports is essential, and effective measures should be taken to secure it. It is equally desirable that questions affecting rates and classifica tions should be promptly decided. The preparation of a new schedule of customs duties is a matter of great delicacy, because of its direct effect upon the business of the country and of great difficulty, by reason of . the wide divergence of opinion as to the object that may properly be promoted by such legislation. Some disturb ance of business may, perhaps, result from the consideration of this subject by Congress, but this temporary effect will be reduced to the minimum by prompt action and by the assurance which the country already enjoys that any necessary changes will be so made as not to impair the just and reasonable protection "of our home in dustries. . , x, . The inequalities of. the law should be adjusted, but the protective princi ples, should be maintained and fairly applied to the products of our farms as well as of our shops. These duties necessarily have rela tion to other things besides the public revenues. We cannot limit their effects by fixing our eyes on the public treasury .alone. They have a direct relation to home productions, to work, to wages, and to the commercial inde pendence of our country; and the wise and patriotic legislator shcUld enlarge the field of his vission to include all of these Of free whisky and tobacco the President says: "The removal of the internal tax upon tobacco would re lieve an important agricultural pro dust from a burden which was im posed only because our revenue from custom duties was insufficient for the public needs. If safe provision against fraud can be devised the removal of the tax upon spirits used in the arts and in manufactures, would also offer an unobjectionable method of reduc ing the surplus." The President pays his respects to trusts as follows: " Earnest attention should be given by Congress to a con sideration of the question how far the restraint of those combinations of capital commonly called "trusts" is a matter of federal jurisdiction. When organized, as they often are, to crush out all healthy competition, and to monopolize the production or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity, they are dangerous con spiracies against the public good, and should be made the. subject of pro hibitory and even penal legislation." Our naturalization laws should be revised, says Mr. Harrison. " Those who are the avowed enemies of social order, who come to our shores to swell the injurious influence and extend the evil practices of any association that defies our laws, should not only be denied citizenship, but a domicile." He favors a bankrupt law: "The enactment of a national bankrupt law, of a character to be a permanent part of our general legislation, is desirable. It should be simple in its methods and inexpensive in its administration." Speaking of the Agricultural De partment, Mr. Harrison uses this lan guage: The creation of an executive department to be known as the de partment of agriculture, by the act of February 9 th last, was a wise and timely response to a request which had long been respectfully urged by the farmers of the country. But much remains to be done to perfect the or ganization of the department so that it may fairly realize the expectations which its creation excited. In this connection attention is called to the suggestions contained in the report of the secretary, which is herewith sub mitted. The need of a law officer for the department, such as is provided for in the other executive departments, is manifest. ' The failure of the la.st Congres to mike the usual provision for the publication of the annual re port should be promptly remedied. The, public interest in the report and its value to the farming community I am sure will not be diminished under the new organization of the depart ment. I recommend that the weather ser vice be separated from the war de partment and established as a bureau in the department of agriculture. This will involve an entire re-organ ization both of the weather bureau and of the signal corps, making of the first a purely civil organization and of the other a purely military staff corps. The report of the chief signal officer shows that the work of the corps on its military side has been deteriorating- The message closes with a recom mendation that the United States should encourage, by subsidy, a mer chant marine that would equal that of the first powers of the world. Bro. John W. Mills, of Alliance No. 1,903, Transylvania county, says our seal ordered some days ago has not yet arrived. We hope soon to be in thorough trim. We mean busi ness and intend to come down to it. The order is steadily growing in the county. Zeal unabated. Our farmers have harvested the largest crop raised in the county for years. . Our money product, cattle, is very dull, in fact amounts to no sale. Down on beef trusts, and all other trusts, forever say we. .-.,

The American Wool Reporter, of Boston, published on Thanksgiving day a petition to Congress in favor of free wool, signed by a column of wool manufacturers from all parts of the country. Eighteen of them were from Pennsylvania, besides a formid able array of signers from Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Tennessee and other States, with some to come. One Congressional custom, says the Atlanta Journal, which ought to be prohibited by law is that of grant ing pay to unsuccessful claimants or contestants for seats in that body. The contestant ought at least to be made to show that he had good reas ons believe that he had been fairly elected. It is evident that contests are now made by defeated candidates in the South with the prime object of obtaining the pay that will be allowed for an unsuccessful contest. A prominent Alliance official, who has been active in establishing Alli ance business exchanges, in an article in the National Economist, makes this pointed assertion: The producing class must unite, market their own products, and buy their own supplies. In this way the chain that binds our farmers to the speculative class is broken. Credit is the strongest weapon of the speculator, and the worst enemy to the farmer and laborer. Eliminate this and we have taken a long step to ward freedom. In discussing the recent national Thanksgiving day, in advance of its arrival, the Athens Banner and Chron icle, glancing over the great work ac complished by the Farmers' Alliance, Slid: "With these many valuable achievements, who can deny that the Alliancemen's thanksgiving will be the happiest and best of all others ?

The Wilmington Star remarks that the trust has got another black eye, and adds: " This time the blow was struck by the Supreme Court of Illinois, and the trust struck was the Chicago Gas Company. The gas com- panies of that city about a year ago organized a trust, and suit was inati. tuted in the the name of the people to test their right under their franchise to organize a trust to raise the price of gas, and whether they had not for feited their charters by so doing. Judge Baker, before whom the case was argued, decided in favor of the people, an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, which sustained the lower court, and held that while the companies had a legal right to manu facture and sell gas, there was nothing m' their charters which empowered them to buy the stock of other com. panies or combine for the purpose of raising the price of gas, and such combination was against public policy and in violation of the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution. Exit gas trust. Score one more for the people." 

PRESIDENT L. L. POLK Of the National Farmers' and Laborers' Union A Reception Proposed Reduced Railroad Rates. I have the gratification of announc ing to the Alliance of the State, that it has just had conferred upon one of its representatives the greatest electoral honor in the gift of the organized farmers of the nation. Col. L. L. Polk was, on Friday , the 6th inst., elected President of the National Farmers' and Laborers' Union, which held its session in. St. Louis last week. In that great body there were the representatives of two million, two hundred and fifty thousand farmers. Wake County Alliance, of which CoL Col. Polk is a member, is deeply sen sible and appreciative of the honor thus conferred, but with the acknowl edgement of this appreciation, we feel that of all the millions of members of the Alliance, there, is no one who is more deserving of, or who will bear the honors more gracefully ana worthily and effectively for the pro motion of the ends and aims of the farmers of the .nation, than him upon Whom they have fallen. We think it expedient and proper that Wake County Alliance should manifest its appreciation of the honors which tour distinguished member wiu bear with him on his return here next Fridav. December 13th. and to this end I call upon the members of the Wake County Alliance to assemDiem the fullest possible force on that day, to receive and welcome him. We also extend to Alliancemen all over the State an invitation to come in a body or send representatives to participate in this welcome. , Arrangements will be made witn the railroads for reduced rates in favor of all who can come from any part of the State. . .
