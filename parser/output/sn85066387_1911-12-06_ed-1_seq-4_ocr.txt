4 CHEERS GREET TAFT MESSAGE IN THE HOUSE Democrats Approve Objections to Repeal of Sherman Anti- Trust Law Senate Has Nothing to Do and Adjourns After a Brief Session WASHINGTON, Dec. President Taft's message on the trusts was read in both branches of congress today and was generally well received. The president's objection to a repail of the Sherman law was approved by some of the leaders on both sides, although the democrats held that his first mes sage should have dealt with the* tariff. Democratic Leader Underwood said the president and the administration were trying to overshadow the tariff with trust Issues. ■ "The message is an able one from the president's standpoint," Under wood sald.^'but we feel that the lead ing message should have dealt with the tariff. There seems to be an effort on the part of the -president and*the administration to force trust issues ahead. lam opposed to a repeal of the Sherman law, but there -may be sup plemental legislation to define it. I think the house does not favor a fed eral incorporation act." X .?'? Speaker Clark said he could not dis cuss the message until he had studied it thoroughly. Republican Leader Mann, who has not always agreed with the president, praised the message. ? XX , 'It is probably the strongest utter ance President Taft has ever made," he said. "It shows that he b on the side of the people; that he is not controlled by the trusts and that he does not wish to cause undue violence to proper com binations of capital." XivX In the house the reading of the* mes sage was interrupted by applause from the republican side. As the reading \ clerk was droning through the words a '. majority of the members were follow ing the reading from printed copies which had been distributed to their desks. X* X V%A The senate heard the reading Of the message with-its usual dignified at tention and then adjourned in respect to the memories of Representative Mad toon of Kansas and Representative Latta of Nebraska, whose deaths were announced by a committee from the house. .?';-7;-..

President Taft's third annual message to con gress, devoted exclusively to the Sher man anti-trust act and the trust ques tion in general, was read in congress today. The president defended the Sherman act as interpreted by the supreme court of the United States, indicated plainly his opposition to the repeal or amend- i ment of this statue, but suggested that congress pass a federal incorporation law and supplemental legislation that "would describe and denounce methods of competition that are unfair." To supervise corporations chartered under federal law President Taft pro posed the creation of an executive bu reau or commission with powers akin to those of the interstate commerce commission. 

HIGHLY EFFECTIVE Sneaking of the dissolution of the tobacco trust the R-J-t^decked that in his opinion not in the history of American law had a decree more er"- fective for such purpose been entered by a* court Portions of his message of January, 1910, proposing federal incnmoration 1910, proposing federa 0"* were referred to in this message and recommendations then made were re- newed. . , The president frequently expresses his opinion of the Sherman law and what might be expected if it were to be repealed. He says: yyy, , -, "The anti-trust act Is the expression of the effort of a freedom loving peo- pie to preserve equality of opportu- £ itv AA-y. «7>r"i,s= ..„.„(, X> o oon<!triief? by th© This statute, as construed^ by the supreme court, must continue to be the line of distinction for legitimate busi- ness.

LARGELY DISCUSSION "Much is said of the repeal of this statute of constructive 3 legislation intended to accomplish the purpose and blaze a clear path for honest merchants and businessmen to follow. It may be that such a plan will be evolved, but I submit that the discussions which >,<.«» been brought in recent days by have been brough m recen aajs oy the fear of continued execution, of the anti-trust law. have produced notning but glittering generalities. "As the offense (against the Sherman law) becomes better understood and the committing of it partakes more of :V,^T^ X^^ithornte defiance of the studied and dlb*ra*e **fia"c a c, law, we can be confident that juries will convlet individuals ana that jait sentences will be imposed." The president's message, in part, fol- lnws t u»a. A**'y-Ayyyy -'-v.--TV'*^lX»U"i "This message is the first of several which I shall send to congress during the interval between the opening or its regular session and its adjournment ror the Christmas holidays. The amount of information to be communicated as to the operations of the government, the number of important subjects call- Ing for comment by the executive, ana the transmission to congress of exhaus- tive reports of special commissions, make it impossible to Include in one message of a reasonable length a dis- cusslon of the topics that ought to be brought to the attention of the na- tional legislature at its first session. "In May last the supreme court banded down decisions in the^suits in equity brought by the Lnited states to enjoin the further maintenance or the Standard OH trust and of the Amer- Ican Tobacco trust, and to secure their dissolution. 'The decisions are epoch- making and serve 4to advise the busi- ness world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti-trust act of 1890. The decisions do not depart in any substantial way from the previous decisions of the t court In rung and applying this important statute, but they clarify those decisions by fur- ther defining the already admitted «x- ceptlons to the literal construction of the act. By the decrees they furnish a useful precedent "Us to the proper method of dealing with the capital and property of illegal trusts. -.. .

This is obviously untrue. By its judgment every contract and combination in - re- straint of Interstate trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of con- trolling prices by stifling competition, or of establishing in whole or in part a-monopoly of such trade, is con- demned by-the statute. The most ex- treme critics can not Instance a case that ought to be condemned under, the statute which is not brought within its terms as thus construed. -*' . "The suggestion is also made that the supreme court by its decision in,the last two cases has committed to the court the I undefined and unlimited dis- cretlon to determine whether a case of restraint of trade is within the terms of the statute. This is wholly,untrue, A reasonable restraint of trade at com- mon law is well understood and Is clearly defined. It'does not rest in the discretion ;of the court. It must be limited* to accomplish the purpose of a lawful 1 main contract to which, in or- der that it shall be enforcable at all, it must be incidental.

This contention - results from a misunderstanding of the antl trust Jaw and its purpose, It: is not intended thereby to prevent the accu mulatlon of large capital in business enterprises in which such a combina tion can secure reduced cost of pro duction, sale and distribution.
