Ill I II IS Many Needed Laws Are Suggested to the People's Representatives IS STRONG ON MORALITY Mr. Roosevelt writes a Particularly Strong Message In Which He Deals With Live Issues, Such as Injunc tions, Lynching and Their Causes, and Other Matters of Vital Inter est to the Whole Country. The following U the substance of (he annual message of President Hoosevelt to Congress, as read in bot'i Louses: Introductory. To the Senate and House of Kepres- entatives: As a nation we still continue to en joy a literally unprecedented prosper ity; and it is probable that only reck less speculation and disregard of ligi limate business methods on the part of the business world van materially mar this prosperity. No Congress in our tiuie has done more good work of importance than the present Congress. There were several matters left unfinished at your last session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will com plete before your adjournment. Corporation Campaign Contributions. I again recommend a law prohib iting all corporations from contribu ting to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already past one House of Congress. Let indivi duals contribute as they desire: but let us prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making contribu tions for any politicul purpose, di rectly or indirectly. Government's Right to Appeal in Criminal Cases. Another bill which has past one .House of the Congress which it is urgently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring upon the Government the right of appeal in criminal cases on iptestious of law. This right exists in many of the States; it exists in the District of Columbia by act of the Congress. It is of course not proposed that in uny case a verdict for the defendant on the merits should be set uside. . He cently in one district where the Gov ernment had indicted certain person for conspiracy in connection with re bates, the court sustuined the defen danfjs 'demurrer; while in unothcr an indictment for- conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under it, ai'd two defendants sentenced to im prisonment. The two cases referred tc may not be in real conflict with each other, but it is unfortunate thai there should even be an appeal en. conflict. At present there is no way by which the Government can causu such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to a higher court ; and the wheels of justice ure blocked without any real decision of the qucs- lion. 1 can not too stroinlv iirsfi the passage of the bill in question. A failure to pass it. will result in ut-ripusly hampering the Government in its effort to obtain justice, espec ially against wealthy individuals or corporations who do wrong; and ma i . . f, ,i , also prevent the Go,ycri.mi from ob- famine? -nuitwia 4n ii'u.raiK-laKa are not themselves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of an inferior count has been against them. I have specifically in view a recent decision by a district judge waving railway employees without remedy for viijutiou of eertuin so called labor statute. It seems uu ub surdity to permit a district juedg against what may bo the judgment of the immense mujority of his col leagues on the bench, to declare 'X pclicy of resorting to the criminal law solemnly enacted by the Congres to be "unconstitutional," and then to deny the Government the right to have the Supreme Court definitely decide the question. It is well to recollect thut the real efficiency of the law often depends not upon the passive of acts as to which there is great public excite ment, but upon the passage of acts of this nature" us to which there is not much public excitement, because there is little public understanding of their importance, while the interested pur ties are keenly ulive to the desira bility of defeating them. The impor tance of enacting into luw the par ticular bill in question is further in creased by the fact .hat the Govern ment has now - delluitely begun a luw in those trust and interstate commerce cases where such a course offers a reusouuhle chance of success. Setting Aside of Judgments and Granting of New Trials. In connection with this matter, I would like to cull attention to the very unsatisfactory state of our cirui inal law, resulting iu large part from the habit of setting aside the judg ments of inferior courts on technical ities absolutely unconnected with tho merits of the case, and where there is no attempt to show that there ha. been any failure of substantial jus tice. It would be well to enact u law 

CANAL BITUATION. The President to Issue a Special Mm aatf to Congress on the Matter. Washington, Speciul.--Ofucial an nouncement is made that the presi dent will send a special message to tongress shortly after the opening, ftealing with the isthmus situation. Ha prepared much data on his retura md expects to fitiish it witbiu week, providing something to the effect that: No judgment shall be set aside o;' new trial granted in any case, civil or criminal, on the ground of misdi rection of the jury or the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for error us to any matter of plead ing or procedure unless, in the opin ion of the court to which the appli cation is made, after an examina tion of the entire cause, it shall affir matively appear that the error com plained of lius resulted in a miscar riage of justice. Injunctions. In ray last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection with the issuance of injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the matter by tho demand that the right of applying injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a luw abolish ing altogether the use of injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts; iu which case of course the legislation would be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of in junctions. It 'is criminal to permit sympathy for criminals to weuken our hands in upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy life or property bv mob violence there should be no impairment of the power of the courts to deal with them in the most sum mary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated lust year. In this matter of injunctions thero is. lodged iu the hands of the judiciary a necessary power which is neverthe less subject to the possibility of grave abuse. It is a power that should be ex eicised witli extreme care and should be subject to the jeulous scrutiny of ull men, and condemnation should be meted out as much to the judge who fails to use it boldly when necessary as to the judge who uses it wantonly or oppressively. Of course a judge strong enough to be fit for his ollieel will enjoin any resort to violence or intimidation, especially by conspir acy, no matter what his opinion may he of the rights of the original quar rel. There must be no hesitation iu dealing with disorder. But there must likewise be no such abuse of the injunctive power us is implied in for bidding laboring men to strive for their own betterment in peaceful and luwful ways; nor must the injunction be used merely to aid some big cor poration iu carrying out schemes for its own aggrandizement. Lynching. In connection with the delays of the law, 1 cull your attention and the attention of the nation to the pre valence of crime among us, and above all to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up, now in one part of our country, now in an other. Each section, North, South, East, or West, has its own faults; no section can with wisdom spend its time jeering ut the faults of another section; it should be busy trying to amend its own shortcomings. To deal with the crime of corruption it I is necessary to have an awukaned 1 to HcrcBflBii unto au unaivoitiu b,. conSi:ieaee alld to guppiiment 1 . ' . 1 . . . this by whatever legislation will add speed and certainty iu the execution of the law. V hen we .deal with lynching even more is necessary. A great many white men are lynched, , but the c,.ime u peeilIul.lv fwq'uent in respect to black liieu. The greatest existing cause of lynching is the per petration, especially by black men, of the hideous crime of rape the most abominable iu ull the category of crimes, ever worse than murder. Mobs frequently avenge the commis sion of this crime by themselves tor turing to death the man committing it; thus avenging iu bestile fashion a bestile deed, and reducing themselves to a level with the criminal. Lawlessness grows by what it feeds upon ; and when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations and lynch for many other kinds of crimes, so thut two-thirds of the lynching are not for rape ut ull ; while a consider able proportion of the individuals lynched are innocent of all crime. Governor Candler, of Georgia, stated on one occasion some years ago: "I can say of a varily that I have, with in the last mouth, saved tho lives "of half a dozen innocent negroes who were pursued by the mob, and brought them to trial in a court of a luw in which they were acquitted." As Bishop Galloway, of Mississippi, has finely said: "When the rule of a mob obtains, that which distin guishes a high civilization js rurrend ered. The mob which lynches a negrj charged with rape will iu a little whilu lynch a white man suspected of crime. Every Christian patriot in America needs to lift up his voice in loud and eternal protest ugaiust the mob spirit thut is threatening the in tegrity of this Hepublic" Governor iJelks, of Alabama, has recently sok eu us follows: "The lynching of any person for whatever crime is inex Mortality Among Stock. McEwen, Special. Horses and mules are dying in this county from some unknown disease. Apparently they are iu good heulth up to -within a few hours of their deuth, working and eating as usual, when they sud denly collapse and suffer intensely. A similar malady affected cuttle here last year. Sumo farmers think the trouble is caused by rotten com. In effect, it is something like blind stag gers, aud no remedy hus beau dis covered for it. cusable anywhere it is a defiance of orderly government; but tho killing of innocent people under any provo cation is infinitely more horrible; and yet innocent people are likely to dii when a moo s terrible lust is one aroused. The lesson in this: No good citizen can afford to countenance a defiance of the statutes, no matte:' what the provocation. The innocent frequently suffer, and, it is my obesr vation, more usually suffer than the guilty. The white people of the South indict the whole colored race on the ground that even the better elements lend no assistance whatever iu fer reting out criminals of their own yol oi. The respectable colored people must learn not to harbor their crimi nals, but to assist the officers in bring ing them to justice. This is the larger crime, and it provokes such atrocious offenses as the one at At lanta. The two races can never get on until there is an understanding on the part of both to make common cause with the law-abiding against criminals of any color." Moreover where any crime commit ted by a member of one race against a member of another race is avenged in such fashion that it seems as if not the individual criminal, but the whole race, is attacked, the result is to exusperate to the highest degree race feeling. There is but oue rule in dealing with black men as with white men; it is the same rule that must be applied in dealing with rich men and poor men; thut is, to treat each man, whatever his color, his creed, or his social position, with even-handed justice on his real worth as a man. White people owe it quite as much to themselves as to the col ored race to treat well the colored man who show9 by his life that he de serves such treatment; for it is sure ly the highest wisdom to encourage iu the colored race all those indivi duals who are honest, industrious, law-abiding, ond who therefore maki good and safe neighbors and citizens. Heward or punish the individual on his merits as an individual. Evil will surely come in the end to both races if we substitute for this just rule the habit of treating all the mem bers of the race, good and bad, alike. There is no question of "social equal ity" or "negro domination" involv ed; only the question of relentlessly punishing bad men, and of securing to the good man the right or Ins life, his liberty, und the pursuit of his happiness as his own qualities of heart, head, und hand enable him to achieve it. Every colored man should reulizs that the worst enemy of his race is the negro criminal, mid above all the negro criminal who commits tue dreadful crime of rape; and it should be felt as in the highest degree an offense against the whole country, und against the colored race in par ticular, for a colored man to fail to help the olllcers of the law in hunt ing down with ull possible earnest ness and zeal every such infamous of fender. Moreover, in my judgement, tho crime of rape should always be pinishcd with death, as is (the case with murder; asuult with intent to commit rape should be made a capi tal crime, at least iu the discretion of the court ; and provision should be made by which the punishment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense; while the trial should be so conducted that the victim need not be wantonly shamed while giving tes timony, and that the least possible publicity shall be given to the details. The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bonds of civilization; that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell therein. No man can take part in the torture of a human being without having his own moral nature perman ently, lowered. Every lynching means just so much moral deterioration iu all the children who have any knowl edge of it, and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next gen eration of Americans. Let justice be both sure and swift; but let it be justice under the law, and not the wild and crooked sav agery of a mob. Capital and Labor. Iu dealing with both labor and cap ital, with the questions affecting both corporations and trades unions, there is one matter more important fo re member than uught else, and thut is tho infinite harm done by preachers of mere discontent. These are men who seek to excite u violent class hat red against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise and proper move ments for the better control of cor porations und for doing away with the abuses cunuectcd with wealth, in to a campaign of hysterical excite incut and falsehood in which the aim is to inflame to madness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogs and foolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a cuuiupign of destruction sometimes seek to associate themselves "with those working for a genuine reform iu governmental and social methods, and sometimes masquerade us the reformers. In reulity they ure the worst enemies of the cause they pro fess to udvocute, just us the purvey ors of seusuntiouul slander in news paper or magazine ure the worst enemies of ull men who are engaged iu an honest effort to better what is bad in our social and governmental conditions. To preach hatred of tho rich man us such, to curry on a cam paign of slander and invective aguinHl 

BRIEF ITEMS OF NBW8. Witte's enemies aotive against him in Russia and meanwhile he prepares to uguin become a potentiul factor in country's affairs. Congressman John Sharp Williams attributes South 's rapid development to practical politicul disfranchise ment of the negro,. The J. J. Astor Camp of Spanish War Veterans indorsed the uclion of President Uooseveit iu dismissing tho bsUllhui of colorej troops. him, to seek to mislead and inflame to madness honest men whose lives are hard and who have not the kind of mental training which,, will permit them to appreciate the danger in the doctrines preached all this is to com mit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthy prin ciple and tradition of American nat ional life. Moreover, while such I teaching and such agitation may give a livelihood and a certain noto riety to some of those who take part in it, and may result in the tempor ary political success of othres, iu the long run every such movement will cither fail or else will provoke a vio lent reaction, which will itself result not merely in undoing the mischief wrought by the demagog and the agi tator, but also in undoing the good that the honest reformer, the true upholder of popular rights, has pain fully and laboriously achieved. Cor ruption is never so rife as in com munities where the demogog and the agitator bear full sway, because in such communities all moral bands become loosened, and hys teria and sensationalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as between man and man. In sheer revolt against the squalid anar chy thus produced 'men are sure in the end to run toward any leader who can restore order, and then their re lief at being free from the intoler able burdens of class hatred, violence, and demogogy is such that they can not for some time be aroused to in dignation against masdeeds by men of wealth; so that they permit a new growth of the very abuses which were in part responsible for the original outbreak. The one hope for success for our people lies in a resolute and fearless, but sane and cool-headed, advance along the path marked out lust year by this Congress. There must be a stern refusal to be misled into following either thut base crea ture who appears and panders to the lowest instincts and passions in order to arouse one set of Americans against their fellows, or that other creature, equally base but no baser, who in a spirit of greed, or to accu mulute or add to an already huge fortune, seeks to exploit his fellow Americans with callous disregard to their welfare of soul and body. The man who debauches others in order to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruption with the luan who debauches other for financial profit ; and when hatred is sown the crop which springs up cau only be evil. The plain people who think the mechanics, farmers, merchants, work ers with head or hand, tho men to whom Americu traditions are dear, who love their cotintrv and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe t to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that cau be iven popular government is to elect un unworthy and sinster usitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever such an issue is raised in this country nothing can be gained by flinching from it, for m such cas democracy is iteself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just as evil a thing as the triumph ot the pluto cracy, ond to have escaped one danger ! I . .11 ! t . avuns noiuing wnaiever it we suc cumb to the other. Railroad Employees' Hours and Eight Hour Law. I call your attention to the need of passing u bill limiting the number of hours of employment of railroad em ployees. The measure is a very mod erate one and I can conceive of no serious objection to it. Indeed, so far as it is iu our power, it should be our aim steadily to reduce the num ber of hours of labor, with as a goul the general introduction j an eight hour, day. There ure industries iu which it is not possible that the houri of labor should he reduced; just as there are communities not fur enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good, or, if in the Tropics, so situuted thut there is no analogy between their needs and ours in this mutter. On the Isthmus of Panama, for instance, the conditions are in every way so different from what they are here that an eight-hour day would be absurd ; just as it is absurd, 1 so far as the Isthmus is concerned, I where while labor can not be employ ed, to bother as to whether the lieces sury work is done by alien bluck men or by alien yellow men. But tho wageworkers of the United States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely industrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint it should be our object to do what we can in the direction of securing the general observance of an eight-hour day. Employers' Liability. Among the excellent laws which the Congress past at the last session was an employers' liability law. It wa3 marked step iu advance to get the recognition of employers' liability on the statute books; but the law did not go far enough. In spite of ull precau tions exercised by employers there are unavoidable accidents and even deaths envolved in nearly every lino of business connected with the me chanic arts. This is inevitable sacri fice of life may be reduced to a mini mum, but it can not be completely eliminated. Investigation of Disputes Between Capital and Labor. The commission appointed by the President October lb, 190:2, at the re quest of both the authricite coal ap eialors aud miners, to inquire into, ccusider, and pass upon the questions i.t controversy iu connection with the strike iu the authricite regions of First Woman to Hold Office. New Orleans, La., Special. Mis Jeanne Gordon, a leader in work for the musses, wus appointed Tuesday by Mayor Bchrmun as factory iuspeo- ftor. to create which position the State constitution had to be amended at the recent general election. The office pays $750 per year. Miss Gordon will be the first womau to hold public office iu Louisiana. Pennsylvania and the causes out of which the controversy arose, in their report, findings, and award rxprcst the belief "that the State and Fed- eial governments should provide the machinery for what may be culled th; cumpiilsory investigation or contro versies btween employers and employees when they arise." Withdrawal of Coal Lando. . It is not wise tliHt the Nation should alienate its remaining coal lands. I have temporarily withdrawn from settlement all the lands which the Geological Survey has indicated as containing, or in all probability containing, coal. The question, how ever, can be properly settled only by hcislation, which in my judgment should provide for the withdrawal of these lauds from sale or from entry. save iu certain especial circumstances. The ownership would then remain in the United States, which should not, howevor, attempt to work them, but permit them to be worked by privatj individuals under a royalty system, the Government keeping such control as to permit it to see that no exces sive price was charged consumers. Corporations. The present Congress has taken long strides in the direction of secur ing proper supervision and control by the National Oovernmmt over corporations engaged iu interstate business and the enormous majority of corporations of any size are engag ed iu interstate business lhe pas sage of the railway rale bill, and onl to a less degree the passage ot the puro food bill, and the provision for increasing and rendering more effec tive national control over the beef pn eking industry, mark an important advance in the proper direction. Iu the short session it will perhaps b; difficult to do much further along thij line; aud it may be best to wait unt l the laws have been in operation for a number of mouths before endeavoring t increase their scope, because only operation will show with exactnes-t their merits and their shortcomings end thus give opportunity to defins what further remidiul legislation is needed, let in my judgment it will in the end be advisable iu connection with the packing house inspection law t- provide for putting a date on the label and for charging the cost or in spection to the packers. All these laws have already justified their en actmeul. Agriculture. The only other persons whose, wel fare is as vital to the welfare of the whole country as is the welfare of the wageworkers are the tillers of the scil, the larmers. It is a mere truism to say that no growth of cities, no growth of wealth, no industrial de velopment can atone tor anv lalhu.,' off in the character und stunding of the farming population. During the lust few decades this fact has been recognized with ever-increasing clear ness. There is no longer uny failure to realize thut funning, at least in certain branches, must become u tech nical and scientific profession. This means that there must be open to farmers the chance for technical and scicntilio training, not theoretical merely but of the most severely prac tical type. The farmer represents a peculiarly high tvpe of American citizenship, and he must have the samu chance to rise and develop us other Americuu citizens have. More over, it is exactlv as true of the far mer, us it is of the business man and the wageworker, that the ultimate success of the Nation of which he forms a part must he founded not alone on material prosperity hut upon high moral, mental, aud physical de velopment. This education of the firmer self-education by preference, but also education from the outside, as with all other men is peculurly necessary here in the Tutted States, where the frontier conditions even in the newest States have now vanished, where there must be a substitution of a more intensive system of cultiva tion for tho old wasteful farm man agement, and where there must be a better business orgunizatiou anions the farmers themselves. Marriage and Divorce. 1 am well aware of how ditlicult it is to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless in my judgment the whole question of marriage und di vorce should be relegated to the au thority of the National Congress. At present the wide difference in the laws of the different States on this subject result in scandals and abuses; and surely there is nothing so vitally essential to the welfare of the nation, nothing around which the nation should so bend itself to throw every safeguard, as the home life of the average citizen. The chuuge would ho good from every standpoint. In particular it would be good because it would confer on the Congress the power at once to deal radically and efliciuiitly with polygamy; and this should be done whether or not mar riage and divorce are dealt with. It is neither safe nor proper to leave the question of polygamy to be deult wilh by the several States. Power to deul with it should be conferred on the Nationul Government. When home ties ure loosened; when men aud women ceuse to regard a worthy family life, with all its du ties fully performed, and ull its re sponsibilities lived up to, as the life best worth living; then evil days fur the commonwealth are at hand. There are regions iu our laud, und classes of our population, where the birth rate has sunk below the death rate. 

TELEGRAPHIC TICKS. Cases of yellow fever appear in Cu ba. , Last vestige of disorder in Cuba is suid to have disappeared. Conductor captures train robber af ter fierce battle in Missouri. Former minister of French flnunce was shot by a woman at Puris. Health of employos in Panama Ca nal zone is pronounced excellent. An American leading a strike at Hamilton, Ont., deflies orders to leave Canada. Surely it should need no demonstra tion to show that wilful sterility is, from the standpoint of the nation, from the standpoint of the human race, the one sin for which the penal ty is national death, race death; a sin for which there is no atonement; sin which is the more dreadful exactly in proportion as the men and women thereof are in other respects, iu character, ond bodily ond mental powers, those whom for the sake of the state it would be well to see the fathers and mothers of many healthy children, well brought up in homes made happy by their presence. No man, no woman, can shirk the pri mary duties of life, whether for Iovj of ease und pleasure, or for any other cause, aud retain his or her self respect. International Morality. On the question of International morality Mr. Koosevelt comes out strongly, advocating cleau dealing bu tween the nations of earth and also strongly advocates international arbi tiation as a meuns of settling all di. ficulti'JS thut may arise. American Shipping. Let me once again call the atten-1 lion of the Congress to two subject!" concerning which I have frequently before communicated with them. One is the question of developing Ameri can shipping. I trust that a law em bodying in substance the views, or a major part of the views.exprest in tho report on this subject luid before tho House at its last session will be past. I am well aware that in former years objectionable measures have been pro. posed in reference to the encourage ment of American shipping; but it seems to me that the proposed meas ure is as nearly unobjectionable at any can be. It will of course bene fit primarily our seaboard States, Maine, Louisiana, and Washington; but what benefits part of our people in the end benefits all; just as Gov ernment aid to irrigation and forestry in the West is really of benefit, not only to the Rocky Mountain States, but to all our country. If is prove impracticable to enact a law for the encouragement of shipping generally, then at least provision should be made for better communication with South America, notably for fast mail lines to the chief South American ports. It is discreditable to us that our busi ness people, for lack of direct com munication in the shape of lines of steamers with South Americu, should iu that great sister continent be at a disadvantage compared to the busi ness people of Europe. Currency Reform. I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great pur pose in aiding the enormous business development of tho country; and within ten years there has been au increase in circulation per capita from $l1.4l to $;13.08. For several years evidence bus been accumulating that additional legislation is needed. The recurenco of each crop season emphasizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, because to leave them as they ure means to incur liability of busi ness disaster. Since your body ad journed there hus been a fluctuation iu the interest on call money from 2 per celit to III) per cent ; and the fluc tuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The Secretary of the Treasury had to step iu and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse than such fluctuation is the ad vance iu commercial rates and the un certainty felt in the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All com mercial interests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for call money in New York attract money from the interior banks into the spe culative fields; this depletes the fund that would otherwise he availuble foi commercial uses, and commercial bor rowers are forced to pay abnormal rales; so that each fall a tax, in the shape of increased interest charges. is placed on the whole commerce of the country. Our Island Possessions. It is urged that these shall receive the careful c msideratiou of Congress and that tariffs, etc., shall be upon a just basis. Army and Navy. The message goes at length into the mutter of the ctlicicncy of our army and navy. The President is much gratilicd at lhe progress we are mak ing in both branches of our common defense. In the matter of rifle pitic lice tho President says: The Congress bus most wisely pro vided for a National Board for tho pioinotiou of rifle priclise. Excellent results have already come from this law, but it does not go far enough. Our Uegular Army is so small that in any great war we should have to trust mainly to volunteers; und iu such event these volunteers should already know how to shoot; for if a soldier has the fighting edge, and ability to take care of hiui.-elf in tho open, his elliciency on tho line of buttle is. almost directly proportion ate to excellence iu murkmauship. We should establish shooting trail a r ies in the large public and military si hoids, should maintain national tar get ranges in different parts of tho country, and should iu every way en courage ths formation of rifle clubs tl roiighout ull parts of the land. The little Hepublic of Switzerland offer u- an excellent example in all mailers connected with building up an effi cient citizen soldiery. Tl 1
