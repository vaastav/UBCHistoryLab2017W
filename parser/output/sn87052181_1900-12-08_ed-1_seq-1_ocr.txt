RELATIONS WITH TURKEY Illinium f it Itupture of Diplomatic Hclntimi With the I'ortc ; lire t'llfomided. ! Constantinople, Friday, .Vovcmbci 80. The rumors that a rupture of dip lomatic rele'ion between the United States and Turkey is imminent, are unfounded. The relations between the porte and the t'nitcd States lega tion are excellent. In fact, the Unit ed States charge d'affaires, Lloyd C. Griseom, has been received in audi ence six lime this year. Only a fort night ago he was invited to a musical entertainment at the Yildiz palace. 1 his proes he is prcsona grata at the palace. i The. visit of the United States bat-' tleship Kentucky to Smyrna docs not influence the nature of these rela-' tions, though it does induce the ports to more strictly concern itself with the United States claims for indemni ty, which were already on the point o' I solution. Dr. Thomas II. Norton is going, Monday, to take possession of his post at llarpoot. The United States legation will con tinue to press its demand for an exe quatur, but a prompt solution of this question is not likely. The orders to the Crnirns. of Bhila- delphia, for a cruiser will be small, ! 1 , the price b-i'ig less than .100,000 Tur kish pounds. ORDERS TO CONSUL GUMMERE.

VIEWED IN GERMANY. The Press and Country DWIilcd on Eropero IVllllniu' llrtaixl to sleet Paul Kruger. Berlin, Pec. 4. The povcrnment' curt intimation that Kmperor William would not lie able to receive Mr. Km ger has created a profound impres sion throughout Germany. What may be called the anti-Itritish section of the press docs not conceal its annoy ance, and the moderate Anglophobt orpar.s with difficulty repress utter ances of disappointment. The inspired journals declare that it was Germany's desire to intimate definitely thatMr.Kruger's visit would tiotbe welcome,nnd,thcrefare,the fact that he omitted to comply with the strict etiquette of the German court and deferred asking hmperor William for nn audience until he had reached the Belg-o-German frontier was eager ly seized as a reason for denying him such, an audience. The semi-official Cologne Gazette puts the matter as follows: '"'lhe question as to whether Em peror William would welcome Mr. Kruger's visit must be answered with- 1 out qualification in the negative. The reason why such a visit just now can not be welcomed is plain, for Mr. Kru- , ger intends the requested audience, not only as a mere act of politeness. but as anoccasion for receiving proofs of personal sympathy. Furthermore he is prosecuting at the same time outspoken political aims, and desires to induce the rulers of those states which he visits to abandon the strict neutrality they have hitherto found reason to maintain in the war be- i tween Great Britain and the Trans ( vaal. The maintenance of strict ncu ; trality, however, accords with Ger many s interests, and it would be a I serious political error if a mere sus- picion was created that, at Mr. Kru ; ger's wish, this neutrality should be no longer maintained." i Mr. Kruger's reception at Cologne I was exceedingly enthusiastic as far as 1 the citiens were concerned. They had planned a torchlight procession and serenades, but the police forbade . them both. ! His dispatches to Count Von Hue- ; low, the imperial chancellor, and to the heads of the German states, were left unanswered. There is no doubt that as late as Saturday foreign office officials contemplated that Mr. Kru gcr would be received in Berlin to day. Kmperor William and Count Von Buelow must have reconsidered the original plan. It is suggested that as Mr. Kruger's invention to come to ' Berlin was mooted in France, the ka.iscr and his advisers may have sus- ' pected a trap. J Ilcrr Von Tfchirsky, German minis- ter to I.uxumberg, under Kmperor ! William's instructions, personally thanked Mr. Kruger for the telegram to the kaiser, and Mr. Kruger, when thanking the envoy, said: ' "I invoke God's blessing upon that august personage." Diplomats generally regard Mr. Krinrer's mission as frustrated, and consider Germany's action as of great political importance, as denoting a ' new era in th relations between Ger many and Great Britain. On the oth ' cr hand the government's attitude is , certainly condemned by a large por 1 tion of the nation, and there can lie j no question that a vast majority of ' the representative journals through 1 out the empire remain pro-Krugcr. Sunday evening the court preacher, . Dr.Kritinger. in the new cathedral, de ' livcred a discourse filled with senti- meats strongly favoring the Boers. i THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Comments of the London I'reaa Gen erally Favorable to the I'real ornl'i Formula. London, Dec. 4. Comment upon President McKinley's message to congress is chiefly devoted to the ref erences to America's Chinese policy. The Daily Graphic says: "The policy of the United States re garding China is not heroic, but it is certainly practical, and there is am ple reason to believe that it will pre vail." The Times says: "The message makes it. clear that on the vital point of insisting upon punishment for the outrages Mr. Kin ley remains firm. We are glad to see that on the subject of guarantees for Christian converts the president makes a new proposal in advance of any put forward elsewhere. In re gard to the indemnity question he is in agreement with some of the best opinion in England." The Times' editorial concludes with the expression of a hope that Mr. Kin ley's second term may be marked by a "satisfactory settlement of all out standing questions between Great Britain and America." The Daily Xews says: "The message contains nothing new, and nothing very illuminating on matters that are old. It will be very closely scanned for its references to China. It looks as though the Amer ican formula were that the powers are to specify the culprits and the Chinese government is to specify the punishment. On such terms a speedy settlement would undoubtedly be pos sible, but would it be effective or dur able?" I'eruvlan Municipal Klectiona. Lima, Peru, Dec. 4. The municipal elections, which began Saturday and continued Sunday and yesterday, passed off without disturbance. The result in Lima is a victory for the electoral coalition, with a majority of 700 votes. Specie from New Sooth Wales. Sydney, X. S. V., Dec. 4. The Oce anicSteamship C'o.'s steamer Alameda, Capt.

POSITION OF GOV. YATES. Illinois (iovernor-Elect Doran't Approvaot Clique Kale Within Ilia l'arly. Jacksonville, III., Dec. 4. Gov.-clect Vates last night gave out a long state ment declaring his position on several matters, among the most impoitunt of which are the following: "As to the senatorial situation, I car. only say that at present I have no candidate fur United States sena tor. I am not in any way committed, to either Senator Ciillom, Gov. Tanner, Congressman Cannon, or any other candidate. Xot only am I not commit ted, but I do not feel myself obligated in any way, to any extent whatever, to any particular aspirant. All of the well-known candidates and, indeed all who are credited with being as pirants, supported the state and na tional tickets throughout the recent campaign, loyally so far as I can learn. There is no reason why, on the question of loyalty to the jwirty, I should discriminate for or against nny !.. of them. So far as the ac ceptance of favors from any or all of them in the past is concerned, I am quite free from any obligation in that particular. I do not know of any reason why I should interfere in this controversy. In any eent, whatever my line of action may be, it will be dictated and animated by the sole de sire to see the wishes and will of the people of Illinois carried into effect. "As to the organization of the state senate, I have some very profound convictions. I tlo not see and have never been able to see why any one man or set of men should undertake to organize the state senate, to the ex clusion of others belonging to the ma jority party. My own idea of Ihe or ganization of the state senate is that it should bean organization distribut ing tin- honors and appoint incuts of the senate absolutclvctiilally among all the republican members. "I do not conceive it to be the duty of the republican senators to concede the appointment of committee chair manships to democratic members. This is because the people, by their vote at the polls, have manifested a desire that the management and legis lation of the state senate at the next session should be republican in char acter. If these two points be con ceded, namely: (1) That the manage ment shall be republican, ami (2) that the distribution of appointments and honors should be divided equitably among the republican members, it fol lows rbo-lutely that all of the :i2 re publican members should be taken into Ihe organization. This proposi tion i my sound like kindergarten pol itics, but if it does, it is simply 1 eaus", for a number nf years, wrong customs and policies have been fol lowed."

Dee. dm, l.ind is still having difficulty to find a re publican who will accept the appoint ment to the United States senate. He was called on yesterday by many members of his own parly, who are inclined to protest at his decision not to appoint a democrat, claiming that some leader of the partv should be given the honor, even though the term would expire within six weeks or two mouths, when the legislature acts. L. L. Brown, of Winona, recently demo cratic candidate for congress in the first district, is being urged, and for mer Congtcssinan ". A. Tovvne is not altogether out of the case. Suen re pot ts as have seemed most reliable liave been to the effect that the gov ernor was anxious to appoint some good republican whose appointment would meet with the indorsement of the republicans in the legislature. These latter, however, are in town in force, and the opinion is generally ex pressed among them that any repub lican who accepts an appointment from a democratic governor need ask no favors of them.

HIS ANNUAL MESSAGE President Sends to Congress Views on National Questions. Brief Hat Comprehensive Samfinry of Ihe Document Oar Fore I KM Itelnttona and Matters of Do mestic Toiler Dealt With. Washington, Dec. 3. The following Is given as a brief review of President McKinley's annual message to the two houses of congress: The Chinese Crlala. The president (Ives first place In his iije.-n.tgu iu ino irouuics in uninn, ana wur cuiinecuoii wiin ine aiuea lorces op- eratlnir there. Fie revlea-s the enttsps leading up to the Boxer outbreak, and me ursi muruers oi ioreigners in cni nese territories. In this connection he says: The increasing gravity of the condttlons fn China and the Imminence of peril to our own diversified interests In the empire, as wen as to tnose or an tne other treaty kov- erntnents, were soon appreciated by thts Kovernmem. causing ll profound solicitude. The United States from the earliest riavs of foreign Intercourse with China had fol lowed a policy of peace, omitting no occa sions to testify good will, to further the extension oi lawiui trade, to respect tne overeignty or its government, ana to in sure by all legitimate and kindly but earn ist means the fullest measure of protec tion for the lives and nrODerty of our law- bldlng citizens and for the exercise of their beneficent callings among the Chinese people. Mindful of thts. It was felt to be appro priate that our purposes should be pro nounced tn favor of such course as would hasten united action of the powers at Pe king to promote the administrative reforms so greatly needed for strengthening the Imperial government and maintaining the Integrity of China, In whtch we believed the whole western world to be alike concerned. To these ends I caused to-be addressed to tne several powers occupying territory ana maintaining stiheres of influence ln China the circular proposals of 1S99, inviting I rum them declarations of their Intentions and v ews as to the desirability of the adoption of measures insuring the benefits oi equality or treatment oi all toreign iraue tnrougiiout China. The history of the efforts made at re lieving the beleaguered Iegatloners ln Pe king is thoroughly covered. miring tne siege, says tne president, tne defrnritrs lost K killed, 135 wounded and seven by disease the fast all children. Continuing he says: Not only are the pro testations of the Chinese government that it protected and succored the legations positively contradicted, but Irresistible proof accumulates that the attacks upon them were made by Imperial troops, regu larly uniformed, armed and officered, be longing to the command of June Lu. the Imperial commander fn chief. Decrees en couraging tne noxers. organizing them un der prominent imperial officers, provision ing them, and even granting them large sums m mo name oi tne empress aowager, ate known to exist. Members of the tsung-ll-yamen who counseled protection of tho foreigners were beheaded. Even ln the distant Provinces men susnecled of for eign sympathy were put to death, promi- m-iji aiiiung incse oeing tnang len-tioon, formerly Chinese minister ln Washington. Oar Chinese Policy. lie recalls the circular note to the pow ers i-?ueu ny wns government on July 3, outlining our policy as one of peace guaranteeing the integrity of China, and says: As vvas then said, "the policy of the government of the United States Is to feck a solution which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial nnd admin istrative entity, protect all rights guar anteed to friendly powers by treaty nnd international law, and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and Impar tial trade with all parts of the Chinese empire. Condition of Pence. A little further on the nresldent sav-s I regard as one of the essentia! factors" of a durable adjustment the securement of adequate guarantees for liberty of faith, since insecurity of those natives who mav embrace alien creeds Is a scarcely less ef fectual assault upon the rights of foreign worship and teaching than would be the direct Invasion thereof. The matter of Indemnity for our wronged citizens is a question oi grave concern. Measured In money alone, a sufficient reparation mav nrove to be beyond the ability of China to meet. All the powers concur ln emphatic disclaimers of any pur pose of aggrandizement through the dis memberment of the empire. I am disposed to think that due compensation may be made In part by Increased guarantees of security ror foreign rights and Immuni ties, and. most Important of all. by the opening of China to the equal commerce of an tne wona. rnese views nave neen ana will be earnestly advocated by our repre sentatives. First Place at Paris. Our relations with other countries are gone Into In detail. The Paris exposi tion is reierrcd to us ottering an opportu nity for a display of the good will ex isting between this country and France. A criterion of the extent and success of nur participation in this exposition and oi tne tnorougnness wan wmcn our ex hibits were organized Is seen in the awards granttd to American exhibitors by the In ternational Jury, namely, grand prizes. mi: gom metiais. a; sliver meaais, nt; bronze medals. .Ml. and honorable mentions. K2 I'.tTti In all, being the greatest total number given to the exhibition of any one exhibiting nation, as well as the largest number in each grade. This the president notes as especially valuable, since It sets us to the front ln International questions of supply and de mand. Relations with Rermanr. Of our relations with Germany the pres ident says good will prevails. Of the meat Inspection law of Germany he says: An Imperial meat Inspection law has been enacted for Germany. While it may simplify the Inspection, It prohibits cer tain products heretofore admitted. There Is still great uncertainty as to whether our well-nigh extinguished German trade In meat products can revive under its new burdens. Much will depend upon regulations not yet promulgated, which we confidently hope will be free from the discriminations which attended the enforcement of the old statutes. The Alaskan Doundarjr. In connection with our relations with England he refers to the partial settle ment of the Alaskan boundary dispute, and urges such action as shall defi nitely settle this vexing question. He says that a convention has been before the senate for some two years, but as no ac tion has been taken I contemplate nego tiating a new convention for a Joint de termination of the meridian by telegraphic observations. These, it Is believed, will give more accurate and unquestionable re sult." than the sidereal methods heretofore Independently followed, which, as Is known, proved discrepant at several points on the line, although not varying at any place more than 700 feet. The War In Sonth Africa. A review of the incidents connected with our shipping to South African points Is given, and he says that tn this connection vexatious questions arose through Great Britain's action ln respect to neutral cargoes, not contraband ln their own nature, shipped to Portuguese South Africa, on the score of probable or suspected ultimate destination to the Boer states. Appropriate representations on cur part resulted In the British govern ment agreeing to purchase outright all such goods shown to be actual property of Amer ican citizens, thus closing the Incident to the satisfaction of the Immediately Inter ested parties, although, unfortunately, without a broad settlement of the question of a neutral's right to send goods not contraband per se to a neutral port ad jacent to a belligerent area. Relations with Italy. The lynching of the Italians ln Louisi ana Is the one question standing between this government and Italy. That coun try Is still waiting for the punishment of the parties guilty of that crime. Successive grand juries have failed to find Indictments. The president recommends that congress appropriately confer upon the federal courts jurisdiction ln this class of Interna tional cases wbtrt the ultimate responsi bility of the federal government may be Involved. Lynching. In my Inaugural address I referred to the general subject of iynchlng lu these words: "Lynching must not bo tolerated In a great and civilized country like the United States; courts, not mobs, must execute the penalties ot the law. The preservation of public order, the right of discussion, the Integrity of courts, and the orderly administration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety upon which our government securely rests." This I most urgently reiterate, and again invite tho attention of my coun trymen to this reproach upon our civiliza tion. The XtcnrauKunn ( nnal. He advocates the speedy building of the Nlcaraguan canal, and rcconimend3 the ratittcatfon of the Hay-Pauncefutc treaty. New Treaty with Spain. Of our relations with Spain he says a new convention of extradition Is ap proaching cumulation and trusts that a commercial convention may follow. Of Spain's claim tn a number of the is lands In the Philippine group not covered by the l'uris treaty ne says: By the terms ot the treaty of peace the line bounding the ceded Philippine, group in the southwest failed to Include several small Islands lying west of the Sulus, which have always been recog nized as under Spanish control. The oc cupation of Siliutu and Cagayan Sulu by our naval forces elicited a claim on the part of Spain, the essential equity of which could not be gains-aid. In order to cure the defect of the treaty by remov ing all possible ground of future mis understanding respecting the interpreta tion of Its third article, I directed the negotiation of a supplementary treaty, which will be forthwith laid before the senate, whereby Spain quits all title and claim to the Islands named, as well as to any and all islands belonging to the Phil ippine archipelago lying outside the lines ascribed In said third article, and agrees that all such Islands shall be com prehended in the cession of the archi pelago as fully as If they had been ex pressly Included within those lines. Til consideration of this cession the United States Is to pay to Spain the sum of HOO.r-00. Our Claims Annlnst Turkey. Our claims upon the government of the sultan for reparation for injuries suffered by American citizens In Armenia and else where give promise nf tarl and satisfac tory settlement. His majesty's goct! dispo sition in this regard hart been evlder.cttl by the Issuance nf an ir.-ule for rebuilding the American college at Harpoot. Vonlri Rxtend Reciprocity. He urges the approval of the commer cial conventions entered Into bctv.-ecn this government and other powers as soon as possible that the agricultural and other industries of the country may profit thereby. Continuing on this subject lie says: The policy of reciprocity so manifestly rests upon the principles of International equity and has been so repeatedly ap proved by the people of the United States, that there ought to Le no hesitation in either branch of the congress in giving to it full effect. Exposition at llufTnlo. The exposition of the resources and products of the western hemisphere to be held at Buffalo next year pi eimises Impor tant results not only for the United States but for the other participating countries. It Is gratifying that the Latin-American states have evinced the liveliest inttrcst, and the fact that an international Ameri can congress will be held In the City of Mexico wlillc the exposition is in progress encourages the hope of a larger display at Buffalo than might otherwise be practic able. The work of tc paring an exhibit of our nationnl resource- is making satisfac tory progress under the direction of dif ferent officials nf the t. Ifral Government, and the various stats nf the union have shown a disposition t vvanl the most lib eral participation in the enterprise. Onr Financial MmivvIii. The president points with, much pride to the showing made by the trca-ury de partment nnd quote3 exhaustively from the report of Sectetary (Jug". He shows the surplus for the year tn tn fTn.SiT.'WD.lS. ami estimates the surplus nf the t oining year at$X0,'j"U.Ui). He says the pre uitcunditlon of thetrcasurvisont nf undonlit'd strength. The available cash balance November 31 was 13.303,T3I.M.

It Is worthy of mention that the greater number of banks being organized under the new law are In sections where tee need of banking facilities has been most ftronounced. Iowa stands Ilrst. with .v tanks of the smaller clas. while Texas, Oklahoma, Indian territory and the mid dle and western sections of the eountry have also availed themselves largely of the privileges under the new law. Onr Forelicn Trade. Our foreign trade shows a remarkable record of commercial and industrial prog ress. The total of imports and exports for the first time in the history of the country exceeds $I,''),0"ii,Ki. The export are greater man mey nave ever neen before, the total for the fiscal year lift) being Jl.a1.1'3.CS2. an increase oyer 19D of JlfiT.459.TS0. an Increaicovcr IMS of J1G3.- OOl.TJS. over 1S3T of J34..1S9,52, and greater than is by j.n,s.fi.m. The growth or manufactures in tne United States Is evidenced bv the fact that exports of manufactured products largely exceed these of any previous year, their value for 1W0 being JiJJ.iil.Tj';. against t339.o?2.145 in 1SS9. an increase ot 28 per cent.

This increase i largely in mate rials ror manuracture, ami is in response to the rapid development of manufactur ing in the United States. Tho Internal Revenne Tax. I recommend that the congress at Its present session reduce the internal rev enue taxes imposed to meet the expenses of the war wltn Spain in tne sum ot wv.- WO.OoO. This reduction snouiu ne securea hv the remission of those taxes which ex perience has shown tn be the most bur densome to ine incusines in me penpie. I specially urge that mere ne mciuueii in whatever reduction is made the legacy tax. bequests for public uses of a literary, edu cational or cnantnnie character. Recommends Shin !ulId. American vessels during ihe past three vears have carried about nine per cent. of our exports and Imports. Foreign ships should carry the least, not the greatest. part of American trade. I lie remarkable growth of our steel Industries, the prog ress of shipbuilding for the domestic trade, and our steadily maintained expenditures for the navy have created an opportuni ty to olacc the United States In the lirst rank of commercial maritime powers. The Trout Qnentliin. The trust question receives the atten tion of the president, and he says: . "It is apparent that uniformity of legis lation upon this subject in the several states Is much to be desired. It is to be hoped thot such uniformity, founded in a wise anu jusi uiscrimimiuon nciwcen wnac Is lnlurious and what is useful and neces sary in business operations, may be ob- taineu. ana mat means may ie lour.u ror the congress, within the limitations of its constitutional power, so to supplement an effective code or state legislation as to make a complete system of laws through out the United States adequate to compel a general observance ci tne salutary rules to which I have referred." The Philippine.. Considerable attention is given the sub ject of the Philippines, and In this con nection tne scope anu work or tne Phil ippine commission as outlined to the com missioners is fully outline'd for the bene fit of congress. Of the present condi tions In the Islands the president says: In my last annual message I dwelt at some length upon the condition of af fairs in tne f nuippincs. vv ntie seeKing to impress upon you that the grave re sponsibility of the future government of tnose islands rests wltn tne congress or the United States. I abstained from rec ommending at that time a specific and final form of government for the terri tory actually held by the United States forest tad In which, u long as Insur rection cr ntlnues. the military arm must necessarily be supreme. I stated my pur pose, until the eongress shall have made known the formal expression of its will, to use the authority vested ln me by tho constitution and the statutes to uphold tlie sovereignty of the Uniteel States in thnse distant islands as in all other places where nur Hag rightfully floats, placing, to that end, at the disposal ef the army and navy all the means which the lib e rality of the congress and the eople have provided. Xo contrary expression of the will of the congress having been made, I have steadfastly pursued the pur pose so declared, employing the civil arm as well toward the accomplishment of pacification and the Institution of local governments within the lines of author ity and law. We Are Jinking" Pronresa. Progress In the hoped-for direction ha been favorable. Our forces have suc cessfully controlled the greater part of the islands, overcoming the organized forres nf the Insurgents and carrymi? order and administrative regularity to all quarters. What opposition remains Is for the most part scattered, obeying n? con certed plan of strategic action, operating onlv- by the methods common to the tra ditions of guerrilla warfare, which, whilo ineffective til alter the general control nnii- f.tnli'lKhpd. nrc still sufficient to beget insecurity among the populitions that have felt the good results of our control, and thus delay the conferment upon them of the fullest measures of local self-government, of education, and of industrial and agricultural develop ment which we stand ready te give to them. Three Inv lolnlite Itulr-. Upon every division and branch of the government nf the Philippines, says the president, must be Imposed three inviol able rules: That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; that private proiierty shall not be taken for public use without Just com pensation: that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the nature ard cause of the accusation, to l.e confronted with the witnesses against him. to have compulsory process for ob taining witnesses in his favor, and to have the n-sl.stance of counsel for his defense; that excessive bail shall not lie required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and umisinl punishment Inflicted; that no per son shall be put twice in jeorardy for the same offense, or be compelled in any crim inal case to be a witness against himself; that the right to be secure against unrea sonable searches and seizures shall not bo violated: that neither slavery r.or involun tary servitude shall exist except as a pun ishment for crime: that no bill of attain der or ex pot facto law shall be rassed; that no law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right" of the people to peaceably assemble and petition tha government for a redress of trievanees; that no law shall he mado respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and that the fre-o exercise and enjoyment or religious profession and worship without discrimination or preference shall forever be allowed. Porto Rico. The civil government of I'orto Kico pro vided for by the act of the eongress. ap proved April 12. lWM. Is ln successful op eration. The courts have been estab lished The governor and his arsoeiatcs, working intelligently and harmoniously, are meeting with commendable success. I)cr.linK with Cuba. The present conditions In Cuba are re ferred to, citing tho call tor the election ut delegates to a constitutional conven tion and th meeting ot the conventiot. uh-ch is now in session, and closes this pirt uf his message with the following: When the convention concludes its la bor I will transmit to the congress the constitution as framed by the conven tion for its consideration and for alien action as It may deem advisable. The Army. An Inciease In the regular army la recommend' d. and the need of soldiers shown.

In Torto Bico we have reduced the gar risons to which include W! native tmons. There is no room for further re duction here. We will be required to keep a considerable force in the Philip pine islands for some time to come. From the best information obtainable we shall need there for the immediate future from EO.tOO to t.0")0 men. I am sure the num ber may be reduced as the Insurgents shall come to acknowledge the author ity of the United States, of which there are assuring indications. It mav- bo apparent that we will re quire an army of about CO.OTfl. and that during present conditions ln Cuba and the Philippines the president should have authority to increase the force to the present number of ICO.ono. Included In this number authority should le glwn to raise native troops ln the Philippines up to ir,,(HW. which the Taft commission be lieve will lie more effective in detecting and suppressing guerrillas, assassins and Ladrones than our own soldiers. Rural Free Ilelliery. Under a discussion of the postal serv ice he urges an extension of the rural free delivery system. Its actual application has shown that it increases postal receipts, and can be accompanied by reductions in other branches of the service, so that th augmented revenues and the accomplished savings together materially reduce the net cost. The Jiavy. The recommendations of the secretary of the navy for more ships and an In crease in the personnel of the navy are approveei. as well as those of the estab lishment of a national naval reserve and suitable recognition for all officers who rendere-d distinguished service during the war with Spain. Agriculture. The department of agriculture has been extending Its work during the past year, reaching farther for new varieties of seeds and plants; cooperating more fully with the states and territories in re search along useful lines; making prog ress In meteorological work relating to lines of wireless telegraphy and forecasts for ocean-going vessels; continuing In quiry as to animal disease; looking Into the extent and character of food adul teration: outlining plans tor me care, preservation and intelligent harvesting of our woodlands: studying soils that pro ducers mav cultivate with better knowl edge of conditions, and helping to clothe desert places with grasses suitable to our arid regions. Our island possessions are being considered that their peoples mav be helped to produce the tropical products now so extensively brought Into the United States. Inquiry into methods of improving our roads has been active during the vear; help has been given to manv- localities, and scientific investiga tion "of material In the states and ter ritories has been inaugurated, irrigation problems In our semi-arid regions are receiving careful and increased consider ation. Washlnctnn Celebration. The transfer of the government to this city is a fact of great historical interest. Among the people there is a feeling of genuine-prUe in the capital of the re- 'Trhe'congres having provided for "an appropriate national celebration of the centennial anniversary of the establish ment of the seat of government in tho District of Columbia." the committees authorized by it have prepared a pro gramme for the 12th of December, llnw. which date has been selected as the an niversary day. Conclusion. In our great prosperity we must guard against the elangcr it invites or an ex travagance In government expenditures and appropriations; and the chosen rn--ccntatlves of the people will. I doubt not. furnish an example ln their legisla tion of that wise economy which in a sea son of plentv husbands for the future. Let us keep always in mind that the foundation of our government Is liberty; its superstructure, peace. A Ilrnlthfnl Climate.
