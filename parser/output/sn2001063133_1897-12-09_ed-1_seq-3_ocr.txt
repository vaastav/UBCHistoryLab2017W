THE MESSAGE. President McKinley Seads in llis First Aumial Communicalioii to Congress. The Currency Question Considered and Secretary Gage's Views Are Concurred in. Notes Redeemed in Gold Should Be Paid out Only in Excliango for Gold. Spain Should Be Given a Chance io Enforce Auton any in the Island of Cuba. The President Strongly Recommends the Annexation of Hawaii. •Still Hopes That International Hi- metallism May Be Ac complished, Washington, Dec. 7.—President McKin ley yesterday sent his annual message to congress. He congratulated it upon as sembling under felicitous conditions Peace and good iwlll with all the nations or the earth continue unbroken, he says and we should feel genuine satisfaction at the growing spirit of fraternal regard and unification in all sections of our country and the lifting of great public questions above party prejudice The work of putting our finances upon a sound basis, difficult as it may seem, will appear easier when we recall the financial operations of the government since 1606. On the 30th of June of that yoar we had outstanding demand liabili ties in the sum of $728,808,447.41. On the first of January, 187!», these liabilities had been reduced to $443,88!),405.88 Of our inteiest b(?arin{j obligations, the Usurps are even mere striking. On July 1, listHl. tne principal ot the interest bearing debt of the government was .$2,332,331,208. On the first day of July, 1893. this sum had been reduced to 037,100, or an aggre gate reduction of $1,747,294,108. The in terest bearing debt the United States lauy of December. 1897, was $84i ,3G5.J20. he government money now outstanding (Dec. 1) consists of $3411,081, 010 of United btates notes, $107,793,280 of treasury notes issued by authority of the law of 1890, $384,903,503 of silver certif icates, and $61,230,i01 of standard silver dollars. With the great resources of the gov ernment. and with the honorable example or the past before us, we ought not to Hesitate to enter upon a currency revision which will make our demand obligations less onerous to the government and re lieve pur financial laws from ambiguity And doubt. The brief review of what was accomplished from the close of the war to 1893, makes unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of our financial ability or soundness while the •situation from 18&3 to 1897 must admonish •congress of the immediate necessity of so legislating as to make the return of the conditions then prevailing impossible There are many plans proposed as a remedy for the evil. Before we can find e. tru£ fi remedy we must appreciate the r&al evil. It Is not that our currency of every kind Is mot good, for every dollar of it is good good because the govern ments pledge is out to keep It so and that the pledge will not be broken. However the guaranty of our purpose to keep the pledge will be best shown by advancing toward Its fulfillment. The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the government of maintaining the parity of our different forms of money, that is. keeping all of them at par with gold. We surely can not be longer heedless of the burden this Imposes upon the people, even under fair ly prosperous conditions, while the past four yea-rs have demonstrated that it is not only an expensive charge upon the government, but a daneerous menace to the National Credit. It is manifest that we must devise some Sond lan to protect the government against Issues for repeated redemptions. We must either curtail the opportunity for speculation, made easy by the multi plied redemptions of our demand obllga -ions, or increase the gold reserve for their redemption. We have $000,000 000 of currency which the government by solemn enactment has undertaken to keep at par with gold. Nobody is obliged to redeem in gold but the government. The banks are not required to redeem in gold The government is obliged to keep equal with gold ail tts outstanding currency and coin obligations, while its receipts are not required to be paid in gold. They are paid in every kind of money but gold and the only means by which the govern ment can with certainty get gold is by borrowing. It can get it in no other way when it most needs it. The government without any fixed gold revenue is pledged to maintain gold redemptions which it has steadily and faithfully done, and which under the authority now given it will continue to do. The law which requires the govern ment after having redeemed its United States notes to pay them out again as current funds demands a constant re plenishment of the gold reserve. This Is especially so in times of business panic and when the revenues are insufficient to meet the expenses of the government At such times the government has no other way to supply its deficit and main tain redeption but through the increase of its bonded debt, as during the admin istration of my predecessor, when $202 315,400 of 4% per cent bonds were Issued and sold, and the proceeds used to pay the expenses of the government in ex cess of the "revenues, and sustain the gold reserve. While it is true that the greater part ot the proceeds of these bonds were used to supply deficient revenues, a con siderable portion was required to main tain the gold reserve. Low-Priced Bonds. With our revenues equal to our ex penses, there would be no deficit requir ing the issuance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below $100,000,000, how will it be replenished, except by selling more bonds? Is there any other way practicable under existing law? The seri ous question'then is, shall we continue the policy that has been pursued in the past: that is, when the gold reserve reaches the point of danger, Issue more bonds and supply the needed gold, or shall we provide other means to prevent these recurring drains upon the gold re serve? If no other legislation is Had, and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued then congress should give the secretary of the treasury authority to sell bonds at long or short periods, bearing a less rate ot interest than is now authorized by law. I earnestly recommend, as soon as the receipts of the government are quite suffi cient to pay all the expenses of the gov ernment, that when any of the United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and oDly paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States notes prefers the gold and gets it from the government, he should not re ceive back from the government a United States note without paying gold in ex change for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the government Issues an Interest bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes—a non-interest bear ing debt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand for gold. If ttwy are put out in any other way, they may return again to be followed by an other bond issue to redeem them—another interest bearing debt to redeem a non-in terest bearing debt. Stop the Drain. In my view, it is of the utmost Impor tance that ie government should be re lieved from the burden of providing all the gold required for exchange and ex port. This responsibility is alone borne by the government, without any of the usual and necessary banking powers to help itself. The banks do not feel the strain of gold redemption. The whole strain rests upon the government, and thn size of the gold reserve in the treasury has come to be, v^ith or without reason, the signal of danger or of security. This ought to be stopped. If we are to have an era of prosperity in the country, with sufficient receipts for the expenses of the government, we may feel 110 immediate embarrassment from our present currency, but the danger still ,-xists and will be ever present menacing us so long as the existing system contin ues. And besides, it is in times of ade quate revenues and business tranquility that the government should prepare for the worst. We cannot avoid, without se rious consequences, the wise consideration and prompt solution of this question. The secretary of the treasury has out lined a plan in great detail for the pur pose of removing the threatened recur rence of a depleted gold reserve and save us from future embarrassment on that account. To this plan I invite your care ful consideration. I concur with the secretary of the treas ury In his recommendation that na tional banks be allowed to Issue notes to the face value of the bonds which they have deposited for circulation, and that the tax on circulating notes secured by deposit of such bonds be1 reduced to one half of 1 per cent per annum. also join him in recommending that authority be given for the establishment of national banks with a minimum capital of $25,000. This will enable the smaller villages and agricultural regions of the country to be supplied with currency to meet their needs. I recommend that the issue of national bank notes be restricted to the denomi nation of $10 and upwards. If the sugges tions I have herein made shall have the approval of congress, then I would recom mend that national banks be required to redeem the nou.« in told. 

GIVE SPAISTA CHANCE. Reasonable Time for the Enforce ment of Autonomy la Urged. The most important problem with which the government is now called upon to deal pertaining to its foreign relations concerns its duty toward Spain and the Cuban insurrection, problems and condi tions more or less in common with those now existing have confronted this govern ment at various times in the past. The story of Cuba for many years has been one of unrest and growing dissontent an effort toward a larger enjoyment of liberty and self-control of organized re sistance to the mother country of de pression after distress and warfare, and of ineffectual settlements to be followed by renewed revol For no enduring pe riod since the enfranchisement of the con tinental possessions of Spain in the West ern continent has the condition of Cuba or the policy of Spain toward Cuba not caused concern in the United States. The prospect from time to time that the weakness of Spain's hold upon the island and the political vicissitudes and em barrassments of the home government might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power called forth, between 1823 and 181i0, various emphatic declara tions of the policy of the United States to peimit no disturbance of Cuba's con nection with Spain unless in the direction of independence or acquisition by the United States through purchase nor has there been any change of this declared policy since upon the part of the govern ment. The revolution which began in 18C8 lasted for ten years despite the strenuous efforts of the successive peninsular governments to suppress it. Then, as now, the govern ment of the United States testified its grave concern and offered its aid to put an end to bloodshed in Cuba. The overtures made by Gen. Grant were re fused and the war dragged on, entailing great loss of life and treasure and in creased Injury to American interests, be sides throwing enhanced burdens on neutrality on the government. In 1878 peace was brought about by the truce of Zanjon, obtained by negotiations be tween the Spanish commander, Martinez de Campos, and the insurgent leaders. The present insurrection broke out in February, 1895. It is not my purpose at this time to recall its remarkable increase or to characterize its tenacious resistance against the enormous force massed against it by Spain. The revolt and the efforts to subdue it carried destruction to every quarter of the island, developing wide proportions and defying the efforts of Spain for its suppression. The civilized code of war has been disregarded, no less so by the Spaniards than by the Cubans. The existing conditions cannot but fill this gcvernment and the American peo ple with gravest apprehension. There is no desire on the part of the people to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have only the desire to see the Cubans prosperous and contented, enjoying that measure of self-control which is the in aliable right of man protected in their right to reap the benefit of the exhaust lessjtrcasures of their cpuntry. Vigorous Protests. The ofTer made by my predecessor in April, 189(5, tendering the friendly offices of this government failed. Any media tion on our part was not accepted. In brief the answer was: "There is ino effectual way to pacify Cuba, unless It begins with tlfe actual submission of the rebels to the mother country." Then only could Spain act in the prom ised direction of her own motion and after her own plan. The cruel policy of concentration was initiated Feb. 16 1896 The districts controlled by the Spanish armies were depopulated. The agricultur al inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison towns, their lands laid waste and their dwellings destroyed. This pol icy the late cabinet of Spain justified as a necessary measure of war and as a means of cutting off supplies from the In surgents. It has utterly failed as a war measure. It was not civilized warfare It was extermination. Against this abuse of rights of war I have felt constrained on repeated occa sions to enter the firm and earnest pro test of this government. There was much of public condemnation of the treatment of American citizens by alleged illegal arrests and long imprisonment awaiting trial or pending protracted judicial pro ceedings. I felt It my first duty to make Instant demand for the release or speedy trial of all American citizens under ar rest. Before the change of the Spanish cabinet in October last twenty-two pris oners, citizens of the United States, had been given their freedom. For the relief of our own citizens suffering because of the conflict the aid of congress was sought in a special message and under the appropriation of April 4. 1897, effect ive aid has been giv«n to American citi zens in Cuba, many of them at their own request having been returned to the United States. The instructions given to our new min ister to Spain before his departure for his post directed him to Impress it upon that government the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war in Cuba by reaching a peaceful and lasting result Just and honorable alike to Spain and to the Cu ban people. These instructions recited the character and duration of the contest the widespread losses It entails, the burdens and restraints it imposes upon us with constant disturbance of national interests and the injury resulting from an Indefi nite continuance of this state of things It was stated that at this juncture our government was constrained to strenu ously inquire if the time was not ripe when Spain of her own volition, moved by her own interests and every sentiment of humanity, should put a stop to this destructive war and make proposals of settlement honorable to herself and just to her Cuban colony. It was urged that we as a neighboring nation with large Interests to Cuba could be required to wait only a reasonable time for the mother country to establish its authority and restore order within the borders of the island, that we could not contemplate as indefinite period for the accomplish ment of thfs result. Embarrnsment Avoided. No solution was proposed- to which the slightest idea of humiliation to Spain could attach, and, tndeed, precise pro posals were withheld to avoid embarras ment to that government. All that was asked or expected was that some safe way might be speedily provided'and per manent peace restored. It BO chanced that the consideration of this offer ad dressed to the same Spanish admlnlstra* I tion which had declined the tenders of my predecessor, and which for more than two years had poured men and treasure into Cuba in the fruitless effort to sup press the revolt, fell to others. Between the departure of Gen. Woodford, the new envoy, and his arrival in Spain, the statesman who has shaped the policy of his country, fell by the hand of an as sassin. and. although the cabinet of the la® premier still held office and received from our envoy the proposals he bore, the cabinet gave place within a few days thereafter to a new administration under the leadership of Sapi'sta. Spain's Reply. The reply to our note was received on the 23d day of October. It is in the direc tion of a better understanding. It appre ciates the friendly proposals of this gov ernment. It admits that our country is deeply affected by the war in Cuba, and that its desires for peace are just. It de clares that the present Spanish govern ment is bound by every consideration to. a change of policy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end Spain has decided to put into effect the political re forms heretofore advocated by the pres ent premier, without halting for any con sideration in the path which in its judg ment leads to peace. The military preparations will continue, it is said, but will be humane, and will be conducted with all regard for private rights, being accompanied by political action leading to the autonomy of Cuba, while guarding Spanish sovereignty. This, it is claimed, will result in investing Cuba with a dis tinct personality the island to be gov erned by an executive and by a local council or chamber, reserving to Spain the control of the foreign relations, the army, and navy, and the judicial adminis tration.' To accomplish this the present government proposes to modify existing legislation by decree, leaving the Spanish cortes with the aid of Cuban senators and deputies to solve the economic prob lem and properly distribute the existing debt. In the absence of a declaration of the measures that this government pro poses to take in carrying out its liroffer of good offices it suggests that Spain be left free to conduct military operations and grant political reforms, while the United States for its part shall enforce Its neutral obligations and cut off the as sistance which, it is asserted, the in surgents receive from this country. The supposition of an indefinite prolongation of the war is denied. It is asserted that the western provinces are already well nigh reclaimed that the planting of cane and tobacco therein has been re sumed, and that by force of arms and new and ample reforms very early and complete pacification is hoped for. The immediate amelioration of existing conditions under the new administration of Cuban affairs is predicted and there withal the disturbance and all occasion for any change of attitude on the part of the United States. Discussion of this ques tion ot' the international luties and re sponsibilities of the United States as Sptln understands them is presented with an .apparent dispositipn to charge us with failure in this regard. This charge is without any basis in fact. It could not have been made if Spain had been cog nizant of the constant efforts this govern ment has made at the cost of millions and by the employment of the administrative machinery of the nation at command to perform its full duty according to Ahe law of nations. That it has successfully pre vented the departure of a single military expedition or armed vessel from our shorss in violation our laws would seem to be a sufficient answer. But of this aspect of the Spanish note It is not necessary to speak further now. Firm in the conviction of a wholly perform :d ob ligation due response to this charge., has been made in diplomatic course. ltntloiinl Compromise. Throughout all these horrors and dan gers to our own peace this government has never broken, even In any iy abro gated its sovereign prerogatives of leserv ing to itself the determination of its pol icy and course according to its own high sense of right and in consequence with the dearest interests and convictions of our cwn people should the prolongation of th strife so demand. Of the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents as belligerents, recognition of the independ ence of Cuba, neutral Intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compro mise between the contestants and inter vention in favor of one or the other party. I speak not of forcible annexation, for that cannot be thought of. That by our code of morality would be criminal ag gression. Recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents has often been canvassed as the possible if not in evitable step both In regard to the pre vious ten years' struggle and during the present war. I am not unmindful that the two houses of congress in the spring of 189b expressed the opinion by concur lent resolution that a condition of nubile war existed requiring dr justifying the recognition of the state of belligerency in Cuba, and during the extra session the senate voted a joint resolution of like in. port, which, however, was not brought to a vote in the house of the representatives. In the presence of thtf significant expres sions of the legislative branch, it behooves the executive to soberly consider the con ditions under which such an important measure must needs rest for justification. It is to be seriously considered whether the Cuban insurrection possesses beyond dispute the. attributes of statehood which alone can demand the recognition of bel ligerency in its favor. Possession, in short, of the essential qualifications of sover eignty by the insurgents and the conduct of the war by them uccordlng to the re served code of war are no less important factors toward the determination of the problem of belligerency than are the In fluences and consequences of the struggle upon the International policy of the rec ognizing state. The le utterances of President Grant in his memorable message of Dec. 7. 1875, are signally relevant to the present situation in Cuba and it may be wholesome now to recall them. At that time a ruinous con flict had for seven years wasted the neigh boring island. During all those years an utter disregard of the laws of civilized warfare and of the just demands of hu manity, which called forth expressions of condemnation from the nations of Chris tendom continued unabated. Desolation and ruin pervaded that productive region, enormously affecting the commerce of ali commercial nations, but that of the United States more'than any other by reason of proximity and larger trade and Inter course. At that juncture Grant uttered thesa words, which now, as then, sum up the elements of the problem: Recognition Impracticable. A recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion, impracticable and indefensible, the question which next presents itself Is that of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to the contest. In a former message to con gress I had occasion to consider this question, and reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful and devas tating as were its incidents, did not rise to the fearful dignity of war. It Is pos sible that the act of foreign powers, and even acts of Spain herself, of this very nature might be pointed to In defense of auoh recognition. But now. as in past history, the United States should care fully avoid the false rights which might lead it into the masses of doubtful law and of questionable propriety, and ad here rigidly and sternly to the rule which has been its guide, of doing only that which is right and honest and of good report. The question of according or of withholding rights of belligerency must be judged in every case iin view of the particular attending facts. Unless justi fied by necessity it is always and justly regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration of moral sup port to the rebellion. "It Is necessary and it is required when the interests and rights of another government of its peo ple are so far affected by a pending civil conflict as to require a definition of its relations to the parties thereto. But this conflict must be one which is recognized In the sense of international law as war." Belligerency, too. Is a factor. The mere existence of contending armed bodies and their occasion conflicts does not constitute war In the sense referred to. Applying to the existing conditions of affairs in Cuba: the tests recognized by publicists and writers on international law, and which have been observed by nations of dignity, honesty and power, who free froirt sensitive or selfish and unworthy motives. I fall to find in the insurrection the existence of such a substantial po litical organization, real,- palpable and manifest to the world, having the forms and capable of the ordinary functions of government towards Its own Deople and to other states with courts for the ad ministration of justice with a local habi tation, possessing such organization of force, such material, such occupation of territory, as to take the contest out of the category of a mere rebellious insurrec­ 1 tion or occasional skirmishes and place it on the terrible footing of war, to which a recognition of belligerency Would Aim to Elevate It. The contest, moreover, is solely on land: the insurrection has not possessed Itself of, a single seaport, whence it may send forth its flag nor has it any means of communication with foreign powers, ex cept through the military lines of its ad versaries. No apprehension of any of those sudden- and difficult complications which a war upon the ocean is apt to pre cipitate upon the vessels, both commercial and national, and upon the consular offi cers of other powers, calls for the defini tion of their relations to the parties to the contest. Considered as a question or expediency, I regard the accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise and premature, as 1 regard to be, at present, indefensible in a measure of right. Such recognition entails upon the coun try according the rights which flow from it difficult and complicated duties and re quire the exaction from the contending parties of the strict observance of their rights and obligations. It confers the right of search upon the high seas by vessels of both parties it would subject the carrying of arms and munitions of war, which now may be transported free ly and without interruption, in vessels of. the United States to detention and to possible seizure it would give rise to countless vexations questions would re lease the parent government from re sponsibility for acts done by the insurg ents. and would Invest Spain with the right to exercise the supervision recog nized by our treaty of 1795 over our com merce on the seas, a very large part of which in its traffic between the Atlantic and the Gulf States and between all of them and the states on the Pucific. passes through the waters* which wash the shores of Cuba. The existence of this supervision could scarce fall to lead, if not to abuses, certainly to collisions per ilous to the peaceful relations of the two states. There cab be little doubt as to what result supervision would before long draw this nation. It would be unworthy of the United States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result by measures of questionable right or expediency or by any Indirection." Turning to the practical aspects of a recognition of beligerancy, and reviewing its inconveniences and positive dangers, still further pertinent considerations ap pear. In the code of nations there Is 110 such thing as a naked recognition ot belllgerancy unaccompanied by the as sumption of International Neutrality. Such recognition without more will not confer upon either uarty to a domestic conflict a status not theretofore actually possessed or af fect the relation of either party to other states. The act of recognition usually takes the form of solemn proclamation of neutrality which recites the de facto con dition of belligerancy as its motive. It I announces a domestic law on neutrality in the declaring state. It assumes Inter national obligations of a neutral in the presence of a public state of war. It warns all citizens and others within the jurisdiction of the proclaimant that they violate those righteous obligations at their own peril and cannot expect to be shielded from the consequence. The right of visit and search on the seas and seizure of vessels and cargos and contra band of war and good prize under admir alty law must under International law be admitted as a legitimate consequence of a proclamation of belligerancy. While ac cording the equal lielligerant rights de fined by public latv to each party in our ports disfavors would be imposed on both, which, while nominally equal would weigh heavily in behalf of Spain herself. Possessing a navy and controlling the ports of Cuba, her maratime rights could I be asserted not only for the military in vestment of the island,, but up to the margin of our own territorial waters, and a condition of things would exist for which the Cubans within their own do main .could not hope to create a parallel while its creation through the aid or sym pathy from within our domain would be even more impossible than now with the additional obllbations of international neutrality we would perforce assume. I The enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would only be Influential within our Jurisdiction by land and sea, and applicable by our Own instrumentalities. It could impart to the United States no jurisdiction between Spain and the insurgents. It would give the United States no right of intervention to enforce the conduct of the strife within the paramount authority of Spain accord ing to the international code of war. For these reasons, I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban Insurgents as now unwise and, therefore, Inadmissi ble. Should that step hereafter 'be deemed wise as a measure of right and duty the executive will take it. Intervention upon Ilnuumltarlan Ground* has been frequently suggested and has not failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration. But should such a step be now taken when it is ap parent that a hopeful change has super vened In the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new government has taken office in the mother country. It Is pledeged In ad vance to the declaration that all the effort in the world cannjt suffice to main tain peace in Cuba by the bayonet: that vague promises of reform after subjuga tion afford no solution of the insular problem that with a substitution of commanders must come a change of the past system of warfare for one in har mony With a new policy which shall no longer aim to drive4'the Cubans to the' "horrible alternative of taking to the thicket or succumbing in misery tl.at reforms must be instituted in accordance with the needs and circumstances of the time and that these reforms, while de signed to give full autonomy to the col-, ony and create a virtual entity and self I controlled administration, shall yet con serve and affirm the sovereignty of Spain by a distribution of powers and burdens upon a basis of mutual interest untainted by metheds of selfish expediency. The first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths. The policy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the universal sentiment of humanity has been reversed. Under the new military commander a broad clemency is proffered. Measures have already been set on foot to relieve the horrors of starvation. The power of the Spanish armies it is asserted is to be us .-d not to spread ruin and desolation but to protect the resumption of peaceful agr'cultural pursuits and ^productive in dustries. That past methods are futile tc force a peace by subjugation Is freely admitled and that ruin without concilia tion must inevitably fail to win for Spain the fidelity of a contented dependency. Decrees in application of the foreshad owed reforms have already been promul gated. The full text of :hese decrees has not been received, but as furnished in a telegraphic summary from our minister are: All civil and electoral rights of pen insular Spaniards are, in virtue of exist ing constitutional authority, forthwith ex tended to colonial Spaniards. A scheme of autonomy has been proclaimed by de cree, to become effective upon ratification by the cortes. It creates a Cuban parlia ment which, with the insular executive, can consider and vote upon all subjects affecting local order and interests, pos sessing unlimited powers save as to mat ters of state, war and the navy, as to which the governor general acts by his own authority as the delegate of the cen tral government. This parliament re ceives the oath of the governor general to preserve faithfully the liberties and priv ileges of the colony and to it the colonial secretaries are responsible. It has the right to propose to the central govern ment, through the governor general, mod ifications of a national character and to Invite new projects of law or executive measures In the interest of the colony. Besides- Its local powers It is competent, first, to regulate electoral registration and procedure and prescribe the qualifications of electors and the manner of exercising suffrage second, to organize courts of justice with native judges from members of the local bar third, to frame the insu lar budget both as to expenditures and revenues, without limitation of any kind and to set apart the revenues to meet the Cuban share of the national budget which latter will' be voted by the national cortes with the assistance of the Cuban senators and deputies fourth, to initiate or take part in the negotiations of the national government for commercial treaties which may affect Cuban interests fifth, to. ac cept or reject commercial treaties which the national government may have con cluded without the participation of the Cuban government sixth, to frame the colonial tariff acting in accord with the peninsular government in scheduling arti cles of mutual commerce between the mother country and the colonies. Before introducing or voting upon a bill, the Cu ban government or the chambers will lay the project before th» central government and near its opinion thereon, all the cor respondence in such regard being made public. Finally, all conflicts of jurisdic tion arising between the different munici pal, provincial and insular assemblies, or between the latter and the Insular execu tive power, and which from their nature m.iy not be referable to the central gov ernment lor decision shall be submitted to the courts. iive Spniu it Chance. 4 Th.it the govern nent of Sagusta has en tered upon a course from Which recession with honor is impossible, can hardly be questioned that in the few weeks it has existed it has made earnest of the sincer ity of Its professions is undeniable. I shall not impugn its sincerity, nor should impatience be suffered to embarrass it in the task it has undertaken. It is honest ly due to Spain and to our friendly rela tions with Spain, that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expec tations and to prove the asserted effi ciency of the new order of things to which she stands irrevocably committed1. She has recalled the commander whose brutal orders inflamed the American mind and shocked the civilized world. She has mod ified the horrible order of concentration, and has undertaken to care for the help less and permit those who desire to re sume the cultivation of their fields to do so. and assures them the protection of the Spanish government in their lawful occu pations. She has just released the Com petitor prisoners, heretofore sentenced to death, and whi have been the subject of repeated diplomatic correspondence dur ing this and the preceding administra tion. Not a single American citizen is now in arrest or confinement in Cuba of whom this government has any knowl edge. The near future would demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just alike 10 the Cubans and to,Spain, as well as equitable to all our Interests so Intimately invtflyee^m the welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If not, the exigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to be taken. When that time comes that action will be determined in the line of indisputable right and duty. It will be faced without misgiving or hesitating In the light of the obligation this govern ment owes to itself, to the people who have confided to It the protection of their interests and honor, and to humanity. Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, acting only from up right and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion nor selfishness, the government will continue its watchful care over the rights and property of American citizens, and will abate none of its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall be honora ble and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty Imposed by our obli gations to ourselves, to civilization and to humanity to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part, and only because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the sup port and approval of the civilized world. 

ANNEX HAWAII. Tills Is Strongly Urged by President McKinley. By a special message, dated the lflth of June last, I laid before the senate a treaty •signed that day by the plenipotentiaries of the United Slates and of the Republic of Hawaii, having for its purpose the Incor poration of the Hawaiian islands as an integral part of the United States and under Its sovereignty. The senate having removed the injunction of secrecy, al though the treaty is still pending before that body, the subjc-ct may be properly referred to In this message, because the. necessary action of the congress is re quired to determine by legislation many details of the eventual union should the fact of annexation be accomplished, as I believe it should be. While consistently disavowing from a very early period any aggressive policy of absorption in regard to the Hawaiian group, a long series of declarations through three-quarters of a century has proclaimed the vital interest of the United States in the independent life of the isl ands and their intimate commercial de pendence upon this country. At the same time it has been repeatedly asserted that in no event could the entity of Hawaiian statehood ceagc by the passage of the islands under the domination or influence of another power than the United States. Under these circumstances the logic of events required tiiat annexation, hereto fore offered, but declined, should in the ripeness of time come about as the nat ural result of the strengthening ties that bind us to those islands, and be realized by the free will of the Hawaiian state. That treaty was unanimously ratified without amendment by the senate and president of the republic of Hawaii on on the loth of September last, and only awaits the favorable action of the Amer ican senate to effect the complete absorp tion of the islands Into the domain of the United States. What tha conditions of sucli t» ui^'on shall be, the political relation thereof to '±2 United States, tile character of tha local administration, the quality and degree of the elective franchise of the inhabitants, the exten sion of the federal laws to the territory, or the enactment of special laws to fit the peculiar condition thereof, the regula tion, if need be, of the labor syai^m therein, are all matters which the treaty has wisely relegated to congress. If the treaty is confirmed as every con sideration of dignity and honor requires, the wisdom of congress will see to it avoiding abrupt assimilation of elements perhaps hardly yet fitted to share in the highest franchises of citizenship and hav ing duo regard to the geographical' condi tions, the most just provisions for self rule in local matters with the largest political liberties as an integral part of our nation will be accorded to the Hawailans. No less Is due to a people, who after nearly five years of demon strated capacity to fulfil the obligations of self-governing statehood come of thr-lr own free will to merge their destinies in our body politic. The questions which liav« arisen be tween Japan and Hawaii bv reason of the treatment of Japanese laborers em igrating to the islands under the Hawaiian-Japanese convention of 1888 are in a satisfactory stage of settlement by negotiation. This government has not been invited to mediate and on the other ha id has sought no intervention In that matter further than to evince its kind liest disposition toward such a speedy and direct adjustment by the two sov ereign states in interest as shall com port with equity and honor. It is gratify ing to'learn" that the apprehensions at first displayed on the part of Japan lest the cessation of Hawaii national life through annexation might Impair priv ileges to which Japan honorably laid claim have given place to confidence in the uprightness of this government and in the sincerity of its purpose to deal with all possible ulterior questions in the broadest spirit of friendliness. IN 

CENTRAL AMERICA. Nicaragua Cnnnl and Snnic Diplo matic Complications. As to the repre.sentatipns of tills gov ernment to Nicaragua. Salvador and Costa Rica, 1 have concluded that Mr. William I. Merry, confirmed as minister of the United States to the states of Nicaragua. Costa Rica and Salvador, shall proceed to San Jose, Costa Rica, and there temporarily establish the head quarters of the United States to those three states. I took this action for what I regarded as the paramount interests of this country. It was developed upon an Investigation by the secretary of state that the government,of Nicaragua, while not unwilling to receive Mr. Merry In his diplomatic quality, was unable to do so because of the compact concluded June 20, 1895, whereby that republic and those of Salvador and Honduras, forming what Is known as the Greater Republic of Cen tral America, had surrendered to the rep resentative diet their right to receive and send diplomatic agents. The diet was not willing to accept him. because he was not accredited to that body. I could not accredit him to that body because the appropriation law of congress did not permit it. Mr. Baker, the present minister to Managua, has been directed to present his letters of lecall. Mr. Godfrey Hunter has likewise been accredited to the governments of Guate mala and Honduras, the same as his pre decessor. Guatemala is not a member of the greater Republic of Central America, but Honduras is. Should this latter gov ernment decline to receive him he has been instructed to report this fact to his government and await its further in structions. A subject of large importance to our country and increasing, appreciation on the part of the people Is the completion of the great highway of trade between the Atlantic and Pacific known as the Nlcaraguan canal. Its utility and value to American commerce is universally -"id mltted. The commission appointed under date of July 24 last, "to continue the surveys and exactions authorised by the act approved March 2, 189.V in regard t9 "the proper route, feasibility, aittt cost of construction of the Nicaragua canal, with a view of making complete plans for the entire work of construction of such canal" Is now employed in tho undertaking. In the future I shall take occasion to transmit to congress the re port of this commission, making at the same time such further suggestions as may then seem advisable. 

INTERN ATlONAl! imiETALLISM. The President Hopes to Secure F»' rumble Action, Under the provisions of the act of con gress approved March 3, 1897. for the pro motion of an international agreement re specting bimetallism, I appointed on tha 14th day of April, 1807, Hon. Edward O. Wolcott of Colorado, Hon. Adlal E» Stevenson of Illinois, and Hon. Charles Paine of Massachusetts, as special envoys' to represent the United States. They have been diligent in their efforts to se cure the co-operation of European coun tries in the International settlement of tho question, but up to this time have not been able to secure an agreement con templated by their mission. The gratifying action of our great sister republic of France in joining this country in the attempt to bring about an agree ment among the principal commercial na tions of Europe whereby a fixed and rela tive value betWeen gold and silver shall be secured furnishes assurance that wo are not alone among the larger nations of the world in realizing the international character of the problem, and In the de sire of reaching some wise and practical solution of it. The British government has published a resume of the steps taken jointly by the French ambassador in London and the special envoys of tho United States 'with whom our ambas sador at- London actively co-operated in tha presentation of this subject to her majesty's government. This will be laid before congress. Our special envoys have not made their final report, as further negotiations between the representa tives of this government and the governments of other countries are pending and contemplation. They be lieve that doubts which have been raised in certain quarters respecting tho position of maintaining the stability of the parity between the metals and kin dred questions may yet ba solved by fur ther negotiations. Meanwhile, it gives mo satisfaction to state tha.t the special envoys have already demonstrated their ability and fitness to deal with the subject, and it Is to bo hoped that their labors may result In an international agreement which will brlhg about recognition of both gold and sliver as money upon such terms and with such safeguards as will secure the use ot both metals upon a basis which shall work no Injury to any class of our citizens. Reciprocity Negotiation*. Mr. Kaat'-on of Iowa Is said to be now conducting negotiations with several gov ernments for reciprocity arrangements under the tariff act, and it is believed that by a careful exercise of the powers conferred by the act, some grievance ot our own and other countries In our mu tual trade relations may be '-emoved or alleviated, and the volume of our com mercial exchanges enlarged. The president earnestly urges the im provement of our merchant mur.ne, tho Inferiority of which, ,e says, is lamiliat ing to the national t-iide. Reference is made to :he recent confer ences at Washington 011 the subject of protection of seal life, the result .f which place beyond controversy, it is said, the duty of the government's concern to adopt measures without delay for the protection of tfife herds. Negotiations to this end are now in o* ress. J, 1 International arbitration is declared by the president to represent the beat sen timent of the civilized world, md treat ies embodying these humane principles on broad lines without In any war im periling our interests or honor will have its constant encouragement. A liberal appropriation is bespoken in order that tho United States may make a creditable exhibit at the approaching 'Paris exposition in which the people have shown an unprecedented Interest. Under the head of the navy, the presi dent points to the n'jces.jlty for si-eedy legislation to procure :he rumor for three battleships now building, wn'.oft would be otherwise useless. He speaks In terms or praise of the quality of our ships, and thinks that the time has now arrived when the increase to which the ci.urtry Is committed should for a lime take tho form of increased facilities couimer.sur at with the Increase of our naval vei sels. He refers to the 'ack of docks and urges that three or four of tho lurLC&t locks be provided on the Atlantic, rna at least one on the Pacific coist and a floating dock In the gulf. i: Enlargement vt the Navy. 1 here should also be ample provision for munitions 'of war and an increase of officers and enlisted men. Additions are also necessary to navy yards, and, as there aro now on the stocks five large battleships, It Is recommended .tha,t an 'appropriation be made but for one "more battleship on the Pacific coast. Several torpedo boats are also necessary. Attention Is called to the need for prompt legislation as to Alaska and tho extension of civil authority within tho territory. There is need for surveys and for the establishment of another Sand office at srtme point in tho Yukon valley for whicn an appropriation is asked. Mil itary force is also necessary, and the es tablishment of some sort of flexible gov ernment. If the startling reports as to the probable shortage of food for the tnlners be fully verified, every effort should ba made, at any cost, to carry them relief. The. message deals at some length with the unsatisfactory condition of affairs In the Indian Territory. The large tvhite element is said to be without protection and without schools or other rigjits of citizens leading Indians have absorbed great tracts of lands and created an aristocracy, and the friends of the In dians -believe- that the best interests of the five civilized ^tribes would be found in American citizenship. Reference is made to the failure, so far, of the Dawes commission to secure the consent of tho tribes to an extinguishment of the tribal titles and a division of the lands. It Is said that 3hould the tribes still fall to ratify the agreement, then some legisla tion should be had by congress. The president approves the recommen dation of the secretary of the treasury for an extension of the quarantine laws, and alao suggests the appointment of a special commission to ascertain the causa of yellow fever. Sale of the lviiiifan Paclilc. Speaking of the pending sale of tha Kansas Pacific railroad, it is said that If no better bid is received than the upset price fixed by the court, the government would receive only f2.500.000 on its claim of nearly $13,000,000. He believes that the government has the authority to bid on the road and has directed the sec retary of the treasury to make tha deposit of $900,000 required to qualify as a bidder, and to bid at the sale a sum at least equal to the prlncfpal of tha debt to the government. He suggests, how ever, that in a matter so important as the government becoming a possible own er of the railroad, congress should enact some legislation to define its views. It is clear to him, however, that the govern ment should not permit the property to be sold at a price less than one-half the principal of its debt, and less than one fifth of its entire debt, principal and inter est. The president devotes the last chapter of his message to the civil '.service, tho practical 'improvement of wKIch he says has long been a subject of earnest dis cussion and which has of late years re ceived increased legislative and executive approval. During the past few months the service his b.een placed uton a still firmer b£ sis of business methods and per sonal merit. While the right of deserving veteran soldiers to reinstatement has been ass( jted. dismissals for merely po litical reasons have been carefully guard ed against the examinations improved and made practical and a distinct ad vance has bean made by giving a hearing before dismissal upon all cases where incon etency is charged or demand made for the removal of officials. This, last lias been done without impairing the power of removal, one of the vital safe guards of the system. Much remains to be done before the system can be per fected, and the president says that he shall not hesitate to exempt cases which he thinks have been improperly included in the classified service or include those which in his Judgment will best promote the public service. The system has tho apprqjwt'of the people and it endea\or to uphold and and it will be his extei it. In conclusion the president admonishes congress not to encourage the increase of the estiniates for the maintenance of the government. They would admit of decrease In many branches and it is a commadlng duty to keep the appropria tions within the receipts of the govern ment and thus avoid a deflolt...: ...
