You have but to look about you in any rural district to see the result, the handicap and embarrassment which have been put upon those who produce our food. Conscious of this backwardness and neglect on our part the congress re cently authorised the creation of a special commission to study the vari ous systems of rural credit have been put into operation in Eu rope, and thiB commission is already prepared to report Its report ought to make it easier for us to determine what methods will be best suited to our own fanners. to add the sense ward äffftlrs, waiian justice the the and Porto and the the ready their must can I the of ing zens in the in which Hopes for Results.

It would be indiscreet and presump tious in any one to dogmatize upon great and many-sided a question, but I feel confident that common coun sel will produce the results we must all desire.

I turn to a subject which I hope can be handled promptly and without se rious controversy of any kind. 1 mean the method of selecting nominees for the presidency of the United States. I feel confident that I do not mis interpret the wishes or the expecta tions of the country when I urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections throughout the country at which the voters of the several parties may choose their nominees for the presi dency without the intervention of nom inating conventions. I venture the suggestion that this legislation should provide for the re tention of party conventions, but only for the purpose of declaring and ac cepting the verdict of the primaries and formulating the platforms of the parties; and I suggest that these con ventions should consist not of dele gates chosen for this single purpose, but of the nominees for congress, the nominees for vacant seats in the sen ate of the United States, the senators whose terms have not yet closed, the national committees, and the candi dates for the presidency themselves, in order that platforms may be framed by those responsible to the people for carrying them into effect. Obligations to Island«. These are all matters of vital ido mestic concern, and besides them, out side the charmed circle of our own national life in which our affections command us, as well as our con sciences, there stand out our obllg« be every as have lines less ernment heritage bend mon ment portance you closing. Our I renders tions mines as vation; life waste tions toward our territories over sea. Here we are trustees. Porto Rico, Hawaii, the Philippines, are ours, indeed, but not ours to do what we please with. Such territories, once regarded as mere possessions, _ longer to be selfishly exploit ed; they are part of the domain of public conscience and of serviceable and enlightened statesmanship. We must administer them for the people who live in them and with the same of responsibility to them as to are no a to sense ward our own people in our domestic äffftlrs, No doubt we shall successfully enough bind Porto Rico and the Ha waiian islands to ourselves by ties of justice and interest and affection, but the performance of our duty toward the Philippines is a more difficult and debatable matter. even Philippines Present Problem. We can satisfy the obligations of generous Justice toward the people of Porto Rico by giving them the ample and familiar rights and privileges ac corded our own citizens in our own territories and our obligations toward the people of Hawaii by perfecting the provisions for Belt government al ready granted thèm, but in the Phil ippines we must go further.

Perfect 8elf Government. Step by step we should extend and perfect the system of self-government in the Islands, malting test of them and modifying them as experience discloses their failures; that we should more and put under the control of the na tive citizens of the archipelago the essential instruments of their life, their local instrumentalities of gov ernment, their schools, all the corn interests of their communities, and so by counsel and experience set up a government which all the world will see to be suitable to a people whose affairs are under their own control. At last, I hope and believe, we are beginning to gain the confidence of the Filipino peoples. By their coun sel and experience, rather than by our own, we shall learn how best to serve them and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw our supervision. Let us once find the path and set out with firm and confident tread upon it and we shall not wander from it or linger upon it. that will those the those ence view be ag we of and all that to first. at to the membership of the com I believe that in this way that and and success and their pre more ef that its we the fur and act all mon the cen dur sub of buBi re Duty to Alaska. A duty faces us with regard to Alas ka which seems to me very pressing and very imperative; perhaps I should double duty, for it concerns It with invest say a both the political and the material de velopment of the territory. The people of Alaska should be giv the full territorial form of govern ment, and Alaska, as a storehouse, should be unlocked. One key to it is a system of railways. These the gov ernment should Itself build and ad minister, and the ports and terminals it should itself control in the inter est of all who wish to use them for the service and development of the country and its people. But the construction of railways is only the first step; is only thrusting in the key to the storehouse and throwing back the lock and opening the door. How the tempting resources of the country are to be exploited is another matter, to which I shall take the lib erty of from time to time calling your attention, for it is a policy which must be worked out by well-considered stages, not upon theory, but upon lines of practical expediency. It is part of our general problem of conser vation. We have a freer hand in working out the problem in Alaska than in the states of the Union; and yet the prin ciple and object are the same, wber touch it. We must use the resources of the country, not be set of en can se mean for States. mis the which the may presi nom this re only ac the con dele purpose, the sen senators the candi framed for ido out own affections con obllg« ever we lock them up. Need Be No Conflict. There need be no conflict or Jeal between state and federal ousy as authorities, for their can be no essen tial difference of purpose between them. The resources in question must be used, but not destroyed or wasted; used, but not monopolied upon any idea of individual rights as narrow against the abiding interests of com munities. That a policy can be worked out by conference and concession which will release these resources and yet not jeopardize or dissipate them, I for one have no doubt: and it can be done on lines of regulation which need be no less acceptable to the people and gov ernment of the nation at large, whose heritage these resoruces are. We must bend our counsels to this end. A com mon ment easy. Three or four matters of special im portance and significance I beg that you will permit me to mention in closing. Our bureau of mines ought to be equipped and empowered to render effectual service than it renders now in improving the condi tions of mine labor and making the mines more economically productive as well as more safe. This is an all important part of the work of conser vation; and the conservation of human life and energy lies even nearer to our interest than the preservation from waste of our material resources. purpose ought to make agree even more na the set are of our out it or » For Liability Act. We owe it, in mere Justice to the railway employes of the country, to provide for them a fair and effective employers' liability act; and a law that we can stand by in this matter will be' no less to thft advantage of those who administer the railroads of the country than to the advantage of those whom they employ. The experi ence of a large number of the states abundantly proves that. We ought to devote ourselves to meeting pressing demands of plain justice like this as earnestly as to the accomplishment of political and eco nomic reforms. Social justice comes Law is the machinery for its first. realization and is vital only as it ex presses and embodies it. An international congress for the discussion of all questions that affect safety at sea is now sitting in London at the suggestion of our own govern So soon as the conclusions of ment. that congress can be learned and con sidered we ought to address ourselves, other things, to the prompt al among leviation of the very unsafe, unjust, and burdensome conditions which now surround the employment of sailors and render it extremely difficult to obtain the services of spirited and competent men such as every ship needs if it is to be safely handled and brought to port. Thanks Congress. May I not express the very real pleasure 1 have experienced in coop erating with this congress and shar ing with it the labors of common ser vice to which it has devoted itself so unreservedly during the past seven months of uncomplaining concentra toin upon the business of legislation? Surely it is a proper and pertinent part of my report on "the state of the union" to express my admiration for the diligence, the good temper and the full comprehension of public duty which has already been manifested by both the houses; and I hope that it not be deemed an impertinent in > may trusion of myself into the picture if I say with how much and how constant satisfaction I have availed myself of the privilege of putting my time and energy at their disposal alike in coun sel and in action.
