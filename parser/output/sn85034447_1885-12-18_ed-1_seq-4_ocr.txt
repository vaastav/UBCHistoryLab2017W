PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. [Continued fix First Page.) Into effect, for which oue year's additional tltno has boon secured by a supplementary article signed lu February last, and since raffled on both sides. As this convention, so Important to tho commercial welfare of the two. adjoining countries, has been constitutionally confirmed by the treaty making brunch, I express the hope that leg Islutiou needed to make it effective may not lone bo delayed, The large influx of capital and enterprise to Mexico from the United States continues to aid iu the development of the resources and la augmenting tho ma terial well-being of our sister Republic. Lines of railways, penetrating to the heart and capital of the country, bring the two peoples into mutually beneficial intercourse, and enlarged facilities of transit add to prof itable commerce, create new markets and furnish aveuues to otherwise isolated coin munitios. I have already adverted to the suggestion for the construction of a ship railway across the narrow formation of the territory of Mexico at Tehauntepeo. 

PERU. With the gradual recovory of Peru from the effects of hor late disastrous conflict with Chill, and with the restoration of civil authority in that distracted country, it is hoped that pending war oiaims of our citi zens will be adjusted. In conformity with notification givou by the Government of Peru, tho existing treaties of commerce and extradition between the United states and that qj^mtry will terminale March 31st, 1830. m RUSSIA.

The inadoquao^ touohing citizensn of existing legislation Ip and naturalization de mands your consideration. While recogniz ing the right of exjjatlation, no statutory provisions exist providing means for re nouncing citizenship by an American citizen, native born or naturalized, nor for termi nating and vacating an Improper acquisi tion of citizenship; oven a fraudulent decree of naturalization can not now be canceled.

I regard wl-4h favor the suggestion put forth by oue of my predecessors that provision may be made for a central pureau of record of the decrees of natural ization granted by the various courts throughout tho United States now Invested wRI) that power. The rights that spring from domicile m tho United States, especial ly when coupled with a declaration of in tention to becomo a citizen, are woit iy of definition by statute. The stranger coining hither w th Intent to remain, establishing his residence In our midst, contributing to the general welfare, and by his vol untary act declaring his purpose to assume the responsibility of citizen* ship, thereby gives an incoluîatè states which legislation may properly de fine. The laws of certain States and terri tories admit a domiciled alien to the local franchise, conferring on him tho rights of citizenship to a degree which places him In the anomalous position of being a citizen of State an l yot not of the United States within the purview of Federal and InternatloQal law. It is Important within the scopo ol National legislation to define this right domicile as distinguished from Federal naturalization. : l < ■ 1 tlie its tion lic fare tivity to and not ical men in rule, I tinue that not ing, ol OUR COMMERCIAL RELATIONS.

A similar treaty was afterward signed by the Dominican Republic. Subsequent!v over tures were made by Her Brltanie Majesty's Government for a like mutual extension of commercial intercourse with tho British West India and South Amorloan denen* 'dencies, but without result. On tak ing office I withdrew for re-examination the treaties signed with «pain and San Do mingo, then pending before tlie Senate. Tho result has been to satisfy me of the inex pedlency of entering Into engagements of this charaoter not covering the entire traf flo. These treaties contemplated the sur render by the United states of large revenues for Inadequate considéra tions. Upon sugar alone duties were sur rendered to an amount far exceeding all the advantages offered in exchange. Then, were It intended to relieve onr customers, it was evident that so long as the exemotion hut partially covered our Importation* such re lief would be illusory.

SALARIES OF CONSULS. I earnestly urge that Congress recast the appropriations for the maintenance of tho diplomatic and consular service on a foot ing oo in me ns urate with tho Importance of National interests. At every post where a représentative is necessary, the salary should be so graded as to permit him to live In comfort. With the assignment of ade quate salaries the so called notorial extra official fees, which our officers abroad are now permitted to treat us personal per quisites, should be done away with. Every act requiring tho ' certifi cates and se>l of the offloer should be taxable at schedule rates, and the fee therefor re turne 1 to the Treasury. By restoring tho re vomie to the public use the consular servi "? uOufV •*•*, firing, even with a liberal tue. ease of the present low salaries. In further prevention of abuses a system of consular Inspection should bo Instituted. The appointment of a limited number of secretaries of logatlon at large, to he assigned to duty wherever necessary, and in particular for temporary service at missions which for any cause may bo with out a head, should also be authorized. t

Some foreign governments do not recognize tho union of oonsular with diplomatie func tions. Italy and Venezuela will only re ceive the appointee In one of Ills two ca pacities. but tills does not prevent the requirement of a bond and submission to tho responsibilities of an officer whoso du ties ho can not discharge.

EXTRA JUDICIAL COURTS IN ORIENTAL COUN* * TRIES. RESULTS OP THE WORLD'S INDUSTRIAL EXPO SITION. Tho World's Industrial Exposition, hold at New Orleans last winter with the assistance of the Federal Government, attracted a largo number of foreign exhibits and proved of great value in spreading among the con course of visitors from Mexico and Central and South America a wider knowledge of tho varions manufactures and productions of this country, and their availability in change for the productions of thoso regions. DISCKIMINARION IN FAVOR OF NATIVE ARTISTS. Past Congresses have had under consider ation the advisability of abolishing the dis crimination made by the tariff laws in favor of the works of American artists. The odl ni of a policy which subjects to a high rate of duty the palntngs of foreign artists and exempts tho productions of American ar tists residing abroad, and who receive grat uitously advantages and instruction. Is vis ited upon our citizens engaged in art culture in Europe and lias caused them, with prac tical unanimity, to favor the abolition of such an ungracious distinction, and in their interest, and for other obvious reasons, I strongly recommend it. treaty Tur len vet. in as the con their civil sur may non of rellg In CIVIL SKRVICIC REFORM—NO RELAXATION OF ITS PRINCIPLES TO BE EXPECTED. Tlie report of the Civil Service Commis sion. which will be submitted, contains an aocount of tho manner in which tlie civil service law has been executed during the past year, and much valuable information on tills Important subject. I am inclined to think that there Is no sen timent more general.ln the minds of the people of our country than a conviction of the correctness of tho principle upon which the law enforcing civil service form Is based. The re its present condition the law regulates only a part of tho subor dinate publio position throughout the coun try. It applies the teat of fltness to appli cants for these places by means of a compet itive examination and gives largo dis cretion to the Commissioners as to the char acter of the examination and many other matters connected with its execution. Thus the rules- and regulations adopted by the Commission have much to do with the prac tical usefulness of the statute and with the results of its application. of new ad tlie he THE 

PEOPLE may well trust the commission to execute the law with perfect fairness and with little irritation a9 possible, but of course relaxation of the principle which underlies It and no weakening of the safeguards which surround it can be expected. Experience in its administration will probably suggest amendment of the methods of its execution, out I venture to hope that we shall never again be remitted to the system which dis tributes public positions purely as rewards for partisan service. Doubts may well be entertained whether our Government oould survive the strain of a continuance of this system which upon every change of administration, inspires an immense army of claimants for office to lay slogr to the patronage of the Govern ment, engrossing tho time of public officers with importunities, spreading abroad the contagion of their disappointment rtnd fill ing the air with tho tumult of their discon tent. The allurements of an immense num ber of offices and places exhibited to the voters of the land, and the promise of their bestowal In recognition of partisan activity debauch tho suffrage aud rob political no tion of its thoughtful and deliberative char as de re oit ex of or of to : l < ■ 1 1 * r. THE EVIL would increase with the multiplication of offices consequent upon our extension and tlie mania for office holding growing from its Indulgence would pervade our popula tion so generally that patriotic purpose, the support of principle, the desire for tho pub lic good and solicitude for the Nation's wel fare would be nearly banished from tlie ac tivity of our party contests and cause them to degenerate into ignoble, selfish and dis graceful struggles for the possession of office and public places. Civil-service ref or enforced by law, came not too soon to check tlie progress of demor alization. One of its effects, not enough re garded, is the freedom It brings to tho polit ical action of those conservative and sober men who m fear of the confusion and risk attending an arbitrary aud sudden change in all the public offices, with ciiange of party rule, cast their ballots against such a change. I artles seem to be necessary, and will con tinue to exist, nor can it bo now denied that there are legitimate advanta not disconnected with office ing, which follow party • fire ton ,ft 9 no supremacy. WHILE PARTISANSHIP CONTINUES BITTER aud pronounced and supplies so rauoh of motive to sentiment and action, it is not fair to hold public officials in charge of im portant trusts responsible for tho best re sults In tl\e performance of their duties, and yet insist that thay shall rely, in confidential and Important places, upon the work of °'dy opposed to them in political affiliation,*but so steeped in partisan Injus tice and rancor that they have no loyalty to their chiefs and no desire for their success. Civil service reform does not exact tiffs, does it require that those In subordinate po sitions who fail In yielding their best service or who are incompetent should be retained, merely because they are in place. The whining of such a clerk discharged for indolence of incompetency, who, though he gained his place by the worst possible operation of the spoils system, suddenly discovers that ho is entitled to protection under the sanction of civil service reform, represents an idea no less absurd than tho clamor of t'.io applicant who claims the vacant position a9 his compensation for the most questionable party work. The civil service law does not prevent the discharge of the indolent or incompetent clerk, but it does prevent supplying Iffs place with tlie unfit party worker. Thus in both the phases is seen benefits is the public serv ice. And the people who desiro good gov ernment, having secured this statute, will not relinquish in benefits without protest nor they unmindful of the fact that its full advantages oan only be gained through the complete good faith of those having Its ex ecution in charge, and this they will Insist recommend that the salaries of the Civil Service Commissioners be increased to a sum more nearly commensurate to their im portant duties. ink, your did. d t into split the Now, what this dyke. in witli ing ture counts eto count bush • ls an during n PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION.
