EVERYBODY 14 PAGES EVERYBODY 14 PAGES NEEDS IT. ' READS IT. LAST EDITION. TUESDAY EVENING. TOPEKA, KANSAS, DECEMBER 6, 1910. TUESDAY EVENING. TWO CENTS EHFORCETHE LAW This Is the Slogan in President 4 -T ait's Message. New Legislation Regulating Cor porations Not Needed. IMG II) ECONOMY URGED Lands With Valuable Deposits Should Be Leased. Appropriation Asked for Valua tion of Railroads. Washington, Dec. 6. The outstand ing features of President Taft's, mes sage sent to congress today, are these: He declares it is time to stop legislat ing with reference to regulation of cor porations and to witness the effect of a vigorous execution of the laws already on the statute books. The exact limi tation upon business methods imposed by law will doubtless be made cleare by pending decisions of the supreme court. Just at this time, the president says he believes the activities of the gov ernment in addition to enforcement of the laws, should be directed toward economy of administration, the en largement of opportunities for foreign trade, the building up of home indus try and strengthening the confidence of capital in domestic investment. Mr. Taft recommends strongly some form of ship subsidy to increase Amer ican shipping, especially to South America. The tariff board is not ready to submit a report on any of the sche dules of the Payne law and Mr. Taft says he will not recommend any tariff legislation until the new congress con venes in December, 1911. Permanent Tariff Board. ' He urges that the tariff board be made permanent and that all future revisions be made schedule by schedule. He vigorously opposes another general revision. The Panama canal should be fortifi ed. An appropriation of $19,000,000 is recommended for this purpose. There must be no more "pork barrel" methods in river and harbor and pub lic building bills. The latter should be based upon the report of a commis sion of experts. In the past, congress has appropriated too much for build ings not needed and not enough for buildings badly needed. Recommendation for anti-injunction and federal incorporation laws are re newed. It is proposed that second-class mail rates shall be readjusted so as to charge magazines a much higher rate on their advertising sections. Strong representations are made for the establishment o a new banking and currency system. Two new battleships and several auxiliary vessels are urged : for thei navy. Thepresident recommends that coal, phosphate and oil lands and water power sites be disposed of in the fu ture by leasing. Cuts Government Expenditures. Estimates for government expedi tures during the next fiscal year have been cut to $630,494,013.12, which is $52,964,887.36 less than the actaul ap propriations for the current year. The estimated receipts for the next fiscal year are $680,000,000. The president urges the extension of the civil service principle to the diplo matic and consular corps and the ac quisition by the government of resi dences and offices for its diplomatic officers. Some criticisms of the Payne tariff act are just,, says the president, but more are unfounded. There should be more officers for the army. The engineer corps should be increased by sixty. The fortifications at Corregldor island, Manila bay, and at Pearl har bor, Hawaii, should be carried to early completion. The Panama Canal. Regarding the Panama canal the president says: "The progress of the work is most satisfactory. It will be completed well within the time set, January 1, 1915, and within the estimated cost of $375,- 000. 000. The slides in Culebra cut offer no great rason for delay." Failure to fortify the canal would leave the United States powerless to enforce the universal and equal use of the waterway against a desperate and irresponsible enemy and would defeat the object of the canal in increasing the miltary effectiveness of the Ameri can navy- The tolls should not ex ceed $1 per net ton. The president should be authorized to - adjust the rates as necessity arises. The govern ment should include in its manage ment of the canal, the furnishing not only to the navy but to the public as well, of dry docks and repair facilities and' the sale of coal, oil and other ship supplies. Interstate railroads should bo pre vented from owning or controlling ships trading through the canal. Regarding the courts the president declares the crying need of the United Ftates is cheapening the cost of litiga tion by simplifying judicial procedure and expediting final judgment. The supreme court should be relieved from unnecessary appeals. The salaries of federal judges should be increased. Recommends Parcels Post. . Postal savings banks will be estab lished in a number of cities, January 1. A parcels post on rural delivery routes is recommended. Postmaster General Hitchcock is given high praise for putting the postoffice department on a self sustaining basis. The exten sion of the civil service to include all clases of postmasters and thus taking these officials entirely out of politics is urged. The president recommends congress to givesome fitting recognition of the polar discoveries of Commander Robt. li Peary. The secretary of the navy suggests that Peary be made a rear ndmiral and placed on the retired list. The stupendous value of the agricul tural products amounting to $8,926, 000,000 this year, indicates a good prospect for business throughout the country. The present census promises to be the best ever taken but it not perfect. The census padders are to be vigor ously prosecuted. A bureau of health should be estab-Hshd.- The Southern Pacific railroad should be reimbursed for its expendi tures in fighting the flood in 'he Im perial Valley of California several years ago. Heavier fines should be imposed against steamship companies -for vio lating the immigration laws. The facil ities at Ellis island, New York, should not be so increased as to offer an in ducement to steamship companies to concentrate their immigrant - business at one port. Immigrants are needed in the rural districts. - Some provision should be made for retiring superannuated government clerks. The only amendments suggested in the interstate commerce law are an appropriation to enable the interstate commerce commission to ascertain the valuation of railroads and fixing the responsibilities of public carriers in the issuance of bills of lading. After the text of the message given on pages 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this issue was in type the following additions were made: Referring to the merchant marine: "Of course, such aid ought only to be given under conditions of public ity of each beneficiary's business and accounts which would show that the aid received was needed to maintain the trade and was properly used for that purpose." , Referring to "appeals from the United States court in Porto Rico:" "Appeals in copyright cases should reach final judgment in the courts of appeals instead of in the supreme court, as now. The decision of the courts of appeals should be made final also in all cases, wherein jurisdiction rests on both diverse citizenship and the existence of a federal question and not as now, be reviewable in the su preme court when the case involves more than one thousand dollars." Referring to the head of the treasury department: "He has abolished 400 places in the civil service without at all injuring Its efficiency." Banking and Currency Reform. "The method of impartial scientific study by experts as to a preliminary to legislation, which I hope to see ulti mately adopted as our fixed national policy with respect to the tariff, rivers and harbors, waterways and public buildings, also is being pursued by the nonpartisan monetary commission of congress. An exhaustive and most val uable study of the banking and cur rency systems for foreign countries has been completed. "A comparison of the business meth ods and institutions of our powerful and successful commercial rivals with our own, is sure to be of immense value. I urge upon congress the importance of a nonpartisan and disinterested study and consideration of our bank ing and currency system. "It is Idle to dream of commercial expansion, and of the development of the national trade on a scale that meas ures up to our matchless opportunities, unless we can lay a solid foundation in a sound and enduring banking and cur rency system. The problem is not partisan, is not sectional it is nation al." With further reference to the postal savings bank: "With a view to its general extension when the income of tho postoffice will permit and the postal savings banks shall have been fully established." In connection .with the proposed parcels post: "A general parcels post will involve a much greater outlay .

Hundreds of Recess Appoint ments Handed to the Senate. Kansas Man Will Be Given a Consular Position. Washington, Dec. 6. Congress gave respectful attention to President Taft's message today, but there were com paratively few members who were willing to concede the probability of favorable action at the present session on many of the recommendations con tained therein.

This also was the case in the house. Among several hundred nomina tions senTto the senate by the presi dent today were those of John W. Gar rett of Maryland to be United States minister to Venezuela and Charles S. Wilson of Maine to be secretary of embassy at Rome, Italy. The nomination of Frederick W.
