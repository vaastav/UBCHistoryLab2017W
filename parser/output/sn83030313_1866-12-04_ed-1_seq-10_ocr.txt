"Hie more Intimate friends of the President assert te eny that his message aa sent to Congress, in all that re lates to our domestic troubles, is an entirely different hcuaoni from that first prepared. The Johnson party now say that on the appearance of Thad Stevens here last week in his great efforts to forests! the action of Congress by committing (individual members to extreme measures of hostility to the administra tion, the President saw but little likelihood of any favorable reception of such conciliatory prepositions as he had designed making, and inasmuch as bat kicks and euflfe were (to be his portion, be could receive such treatment with better advantage on his own grounds. Hence he revised the message and maseerted his former line of policy. It is rumored to-night that the French Minister is disposed to take exception to the elntement in the massage, that the French government gave no ?' intimation" to the Department of State of thalr change of plan In removing the entire French ?may from Mexico this winter instead of prolonging its departure until November, 1807. The Marquis de Mon the ton, It Is stated, gave repeated " intlmationa' to the decretory of Stats within tha last month of the new pro gpamme of the Emperor, which seemed to afford entire ?surfaction to Mr. Seward. Tha Prasidant, it is thought, was offended that the French Minister of Foreign Affairs did not writs a formal despatch on thle subject, but tbs Freerb government evidently supposed that a repre ?Rotation by tbeir Minister here of the change or plan, with its motives, was all that was necessary. It seems steer that nothing was farther from the Intention or tbe French government than to give offence to ours Fa opened BUI Deflnlwn the Powers of the Pre sident and his Cabinet. Roaster Sherman is preparing an important bill de teing certain power* of not only the President but the dscretaries.

Rejecting la constitutional amendment, the* show that :hey in sist upon repreaeoiatlon in Cougrcas and tbe Elective College for all tbe four millions of their former slaves, thua ascending to enlarged and increased lawmaking power, In consequence of their rebellion; while at the same time tbey not only disfranchise them and refaae them tbe right and protection of citlaens, but, by disgraceful and (oppres sive laws, pretending to regulate labor ecniraou, and to punish vagrancy, reduce those whom lit* nation made free to a conditlou of subserviency and serfdom but little If any better than slavery itself. Yet while we cannot compel thou to approve the constitu tional amendment, our duty to the nation, to jus tice. liberty and humanity, la nona the less; and, exponents of the uatlnnal will as we art, we caunot avoid that dutv. Indeed, we may see in it the finger of Providence. Like our fathers, we have in the past few years -'bullded better than we anew." In tbe earlier stage of the war bow wil lingly would an overs helming majority of the people have consented to perpetual slavery in the republic Uf Southern traitors bad taken the " ~ from our lipa the bloody chalice of cruel war, which they compelled us to drain fo Its very dregs. Rut God willed otherwise, and at last, when every family altar had been crimsoned with Mood, and evegr ceme tery aud churchyard crowded with patriot graves, the nation rose to a higher plan of dirty and resolved la these halls that slaverv most die. Then the Mono -cloud ' of war posMtd away; God's smile sjiooe on our banners victory after victory blessed our gallant armies, and tlie crowning triumph was won that gave salvation to the Union and freedom to the slave. Since then we have been earnestly strangling tor reconstruction, on some enduring and loyal foundation. Stumbling blocks have impeded our progress, and when at last a mild aod magnanimous proposition It made, embodying no contiscations, no banishments no penalties of the ofTended law, we are battled by a harden ing of heart against It as inexplicable as it seems irre movable. Roes Rt not seein oh if again the Creator is leading tro in His way rather than our owuf And as we turn for light duos it not flash upon us tha' He again requires the nation to conquer lis prejudices; that as He, so far above us, has put all human beings under an equality before the divine law and called them all his children, He demands that we sball put all undur an equality before the human law, so that every per son In all the region poisoned by the influences of slavery uoil the principles of treason, shall bo clothed with all the rights necessary lor the fullest and surest self-protect ion against tyranny, outrage and wrong, and not lelt defenceless to the mercy ol those who so long exhibited no mercy to the government ibrv sought to destroy. The question naturally arises, bow can this be done " Surrounded by ihwe' abb- states men, returning here us thev do. crowned with sn uupwralleled popular indorsement, it might not be tilting to anticipate their arguments on ihese vital themes in tbe session just opening. But when tbe const itutiwn declares In its opening sentence that "all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress or tbe United Stated," when it solemnly en joins that the United States sball guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government, and when It gives to Con iress full authority to rnai.e all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrytug Into execution a'l powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States or lu anv deuart raent or oflloe thereof, the duty and its exercise seem to have been spectfleallv anticipated by the I'ramers or our supreme law. Since President Johnson declared, in May, 1S65, that the rebellion bad destroyed all civil guy. eminent in the rebellious States, Congress, which hits re cognized none of the government established th?re under the authority of military law except the rebel dislr.-in chlsing gov rnnient of the State ot Tennessee, has to settle the ques1 ion. under the oath: of Its mem burn to support and defend tbe constitution, wheihei these provisional and unrecognized governments in which those who have boon tbe bitter enemies of I be republic are dominant in thoir executive, legi-iative ami judicial departments?where to have been a Soldier o' the Union, dead or living, is a reproach?where de.o {ion to . the . lost cause of treason is openly avowed and is tbe guarantee of populai tuvor? where the colors aDd the heroes of th? rebellion ore enthusiastic.? lly hailed, and whefe citizenship is refused te the oni" people in their midst, who, as a ota?.. hate beeudoyal?are, or ere not, republican forms <>?' govern ment, which it'is the dut.v of the t'niied states t<> guarantee and prdtent. f/tavhig IhU ami kbit red ipier Pons to tbepo who will so ably discus* mem. can we not all Hero say as loyal and pntriotki arid justice-im ng cltfv.au", Jt* 'or uxanri Air mir children.
