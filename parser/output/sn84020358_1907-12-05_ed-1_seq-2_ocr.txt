There Was considerable interest last evening in police circles centered in the meeting: held "by the Civil service hoard to jo over the papers handed in by the competitors in the recent exam ination held for the position of Captain on the force. The board met last night for Us regular monthly meeting and after disposing of a small amount of business took up the consideration of papers. Not all the papers were re viewed last evening although the mem bers of the board who were present, and they -were all there except Dr. Whitfemore, remained at . their tasx until nearly 11 o'clock. They reported after the session that they had revtewt ed about half of the ten papers which were handed in and that they had ad journed until Saturday evening for the final consideration. At that time they plan to get an early start and state positively that they expect to finish without doubt at that session.

SUICIDE BY t SHOOTING Bridgeport Woman Writes Last Letter to Mother In New Haven. Bridgeport, Dec. 4. Miss Minnie Swan, aged thirty-five, committed sui cide by shooting through the heart while alone in her home at 179 Pem broke street, about noon to-day. Her hueband, Elbert G. Swan, is owner and captain of an oyster steamer. Mrs, Swan had been given to fits of melancholia of late, but had not shown any evidence of suicidal mania. An unfinished letter to her mother, Mrs. Jacobs, of New Haven, the phraseol ogy well connected and of a bright .tone, speaking of Intended Christmas presents to members of 'the family, was found, and from this it is believed that the suicidal Impulse was very sudden and promptly acted upon. The couple had no children. CONCERN INCREASES STOCK. Hartford. Dec. 4.

Ingenious Play With Bright Dialogue The "Speech" Habit. The world of fantasy, and dreams was let loose In the Hyperion last night, the "Road to Yesterday" being the vehicle of transition. In the mad scramble for originality playwrights have searched the past, the present and the future for material and some times got It but It remained for two women, Beulah Dlx and Evelyn Suth erland to make a combination of fact and fancy which connects two periods 800 years apart. Two acts, the first and the last, deal with the period of 1903, the two middle acts of the play have to do with the period of 1603, where the characters of the later per iod first live and move and have their being but in quite different spheres. An American girl fascinated by the modern sights of medieval London wishes herself back in the land of ro mances, "where there were real men as the plays have it who could and always did vanquish a dozen single handed." By some necromancy con nected with midsummers eve she gets her wish and the dial is turned back three centuries. The land of romance and strong men proves to be anything but pleasant and the adventurous one has 'some unpleasant adventures until with the aid of a young man in a leather suit, not a chauffeur, she finds the road 'back from yesterday and ar rives,, in the last act, In the modern studio she started from, pretty well satisfied to let matters of the past alone. The play is an ingenious one and the dialogue bright. It gives a lot of opportunities for the actors, particu larly in the acts dealing with, the early period where people ate with their knives, lords of . the realm married where they wished and witchcraft and murder flourished. Minnie Dupree was the central figure in Elspeth Tyrell, modern, and lady Elizabeth Tyrell me dieval. Her winsomeness and earnest ness and elaborate freedom from stagely tricks quite charmed the audi ence, and to show its appreciation the audience literally dragged her forth twice to make a speech. New Haven has gone mad about the subject of a speech by the star. It Is demanded at every play at the end of the second act and is a form of idiocy hard to under stand as the star not once in a thous and times has anything to say and can't say it If she or he has. Miss (Du pree finally silenced the tumult by say ing "thank you," which had the desir ed effect. Is it possible that New Ha ven audiences want more than their money's worth? Next .they will be asking that the star turn three back somersaults after the second act! Miss Dupreo had a good company with her and the performances were most creditable in every way. 

KNOX B00MN0W ON Pennsylvania Republican Con gressional Delegation Comes , Out Squarely. Washington, Dec. 4. The boom of Senator Philander C. Knox, of Penn sylvania, for the presidency was for mally launched at a notable banquet j m tnis city to-night when the Penn 1 sylvanla republican congressional dele- ffation placed Itself squarely on record ! in favor of the Pennsylvania senator as President Roosevelt's successor. The , occasion was a dinner given by former I Representative Joseph C. Sibley, of J Pennsylvania, to the Pennsylvania del egation m congress. Mr. Knox's can didacy was hailed most enthusiastical ly by his colleagues in congress. Repre sentative Burke, of Pittsburg, was the first speaker and his remarks evoked ' frequent applause. , Senator Knox spoke, expressing his 'gratitude for the feeling demonstrated and closed by saying that the republi can party will name the next presi dent of the United States, and its choice, wherever it may fall, will re ceive unanimous republican approval. 

NOTED SINGER DEAD. Minneapolis, Dec. 4. Mrs. Maud Ul jner Jones, formerly a leading soprano singer with the Bostonlans, died of cancer at her home here yesterday. She was it years old. DIED WHILE TALKING. New London, Dec. 4. Edward J. Topham, aged sixty-five, was stricken by heart failure while talking to asso. elates at C. D. Boss & Son's cracker factory this morning and died in a few 1 minutes- Washington, Dec. 4. Nearly a .housand bills were Introduced in the senate to-day and all of them were referred to committees. No other business of importance was transact ed. Almost all of these bills were con$idi;d In the last congress and most of them were private pension bills. Contrary to general expectations, Senator Aldrlch, chairman of the committee on finance of the senate, will not introduce a currency bill. His plan Is to receive all suggestions for cur rency legislation, to lay them before his committee and to have them fully discussed In order that the committee Itself may frame a bill which may be reported to the senate. Among the more important measures Introduced to-day were the following: Ey Senator Fulton: Amending the railroad rate law in Such manner that a change of tariff filed with the Inter state commerce commission cannot go Into effect where objection is made un til the commission has declared the rate fair. By Senator Dick: The administration measure providing for an increase of pay for members of the army, navy and marine corps. By Senator La Follette: Requiring that railroad rates shall be fixed so as to, only yield a fair return on the valu ation of a road's property. By Senator Nelson: Extending the freo delivery service to all towhs hav ing a postal revenue of 8,000. A short bill which may take the place of a regular ship subsidy bill this session was introduced by Senator Qalllnger. It provides for an Increase of the mall-carrying rate for slxteen knot ships plying on the Pacific and the South Atlantic to an amount not exceeding the rate paid to first-class vessels. The bill is designed to meet the ideas set forth on ship subsidy in the president's message. Two single statehood bills were in troduced, one by Senator Teller for the admission of'New Mexico and the eth er by Senator Stone for the admission of Arizona as a state. 

CURRENCY COMMITTEE. Sub-Committee of Fit Appointed to Draft Relief BUI. "Washington, Dec. 4. The newly appointed house committee on bank ing and currency held its first meet ing to-day, spending two and one-half hours in discussing the currency ques tion in several of its phases. At the conclusion of the meeting several of the members stated that as a result of the conference the members of the committee were no nearer togther than they ever had been. The only definite action taken at the meeting was the authorising of! the chair to appoint a sub-committee of five to draft and submit a currency bill to correct the present financial situa tion. There will be no hearings before the committee until the sub-committee has finished its task and the complet ed draft is Jn the hands of the chair man. The recurrence of 'two phases of currency discussion marked the con ference. These were: The creation of elasticity in tire currency and the dis position of reserve balances in national banks. The committee was apparently agreed that it will sanction no move to lncreasa the bulk of paper money, but will confine itself to the consider ation of the best means of injecting elasticity. The plan of providing for the issu ance of national bank credit notes, which can be instantly drawn into cir culation when general conditions re quire an Increased currency and retire ment as promptly when the need has passed, was presented and discussed at some length.

(Continued from First Page.) scene at the wreck, after giving the details of his run from Union Ci Just prior to, the collision with Fish er's train, and testified that Fisher said to him Just after the crash: "BUI, what was he (Fisher) thinking of?" Flynn told Eaton to keep quiet, and not talk so much for everything he said might go against him later. The bad weather on the night of the wreck, which Is another point all the witnesses have to confirm, was dwelt upon at length, the conductor backing up the statements of the former wit nesses that it was raining, blowing and freezing. Mr. Blatchley was the next witness. Ho was put on by the state and told of his going through the car with Con ductor Eaton soon after It left Water bury, checking off the passenger on prepared lists which each had. Other details of the trip were described and In cross examination he said that he did not see Kiton make an effort to pull the signal rope. After one question was asked Con ductor Flynn. the defense called the accused man. He gave a long account of his service with the road, reviewing all the runs during his eighteen years of service with the road. He had been an engineer eight years and during that time his life was spent in the cab of a freight engine. His passenger runs were few and far between and he udmitted that he was not qualified to taKe a passenger train over the Naug atuck dltlslon at night. A bunch of time slips for dates covering dallyl runs all through the year 1D0 and part of 1907 were identified, these being freight runs all over the road. They showed that on some days the engineer worked twenty-one hours at stretch. They were Introduced to show that the defendant had had little experience as a passenger engineer and that he was accustomed to run slowly and there fore wis likely to miscalculate distance while running a fast moving train. Especially was this so, it was shown, on unfamiliar territory. ' ' Fisher was then temporarily excused and Mr. Tarr waB called. He testified regarding the weather on the night of the wreck, saying that It was about the same in New Haven as it was in Waterbury. He was closely cross-examined by Assistant State Attorney Kellogg, who tried to have the weith er observer admit that conditions In Waterbury and. New Haven ware like ly to be somewhat different. The tes timony ws unimportant. The defendant was again calied to the stand and went "into detail regard ing rules and regulations of the road. He Identified orders, described the pos ition of the whistle which was suppos ed to have been given if the conductor had pulled the cord and was about to relate the details of the wreck when court waa adjourned. .

Some plain talk was indulged in to-day by railway of ficers over the action of the New York, New Haven & Hartford, the Boston St Albany and the Boston & Maine railroads in serving notice of , with drawal from the per diem agreement on charges for freight cars. The movement to avoid paying the regular 50 cents per day rehtal for the use of cars belonging to other com panies was started by the New Haven, and If it succeeds, so railway men con- , tend, the work of some twenty year will be undone. , According to an officer prominent in the American Railway association, the ultimate object of Imposing the per diem charge, as agreed upon by all roads, was to break up a habit some lines had formed of using the cars of other companies rather than supply their own. At first three-fourth of one cent a mile was the rate agreed upon. It was soon found, that the worst of fenders gladly paid that rental rather than buy their own cars, so the rata was increased a fraction. After experi ments, lasting fifteen years, the deci sion was finally reached that the mile age reports made by the roads hiring cars from other companies were unre liable. The straight per diem charge of twenty cents was then enforced. By degrees It was increased to fifty cents, the rate now prevailing. j DEATH AN ACCIDENT; Coroner Mix yesterday verified the report of Medical Examiner Bartlett finding that the death of Frank PlU patrlck at 10 Prlndle alley Tuesday night was caused by a fall downstairs while Intoxicated.
