IN one of the shortest messages ever sent to congress President Wilson urges that early action be taken to complete his program of "settlement and regulation" recommended at the last session. The message In full Is as follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon- me by the constitution of communicating to you from time to time information ofvthe state of the Union and recommending to your con slderation such legislative measures as may be Judged necessary and expedl ent I shall continue the practice, which I hope has been acceptable to you. of t| leaving to the renorts of th<? sornmi heads of the executive deportments ' the elaboration of the detailed needs ' of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general public policy with which It seems nee essary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time under which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my suggestions as few as possible. But there were some things left undone at the i last session which there will now be ; time to complete and which It seems necessary In the Interest of the publir to do at once. Tha Railroad Problom. In the first place, it seems to me im- ? peratlvely necessary that the earliest "< possible consideration and action 111 should be accorded the remaining fh' . measures of the program of setfrl^MlMI and regulation which I had occasion to lc 1 recommend to you at the close qt your ir last session' In view of the public dangers disclosed by*the unaccommodated lU difficulties which then existed and ly > which still unhappily continue to ex sh 1st between the railroads of the coun Kr try and their locomotive engineers 'J conductors and trainmen. Pr I then recommended: First, immediate provision for tin es enlargement and administrative reor- ar ganizatlon of the Interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied 00 In the bill recently passed by the house *? of representatives and now awaiting *? action by the senate In order that the " commission may be enabled to don) ^ wltn the many great and various du ' ties now devolving upon It- with a nc promptness and thoroughness which ^ are, with Its present constitution and ru means of action, practically Impossible. oe Second, the establishment of an eight m hour day as the legal basis alike of w work and of wages In the employment of all railway employees who are ac- v? tually engaged In the work of opernt w Ing trains 111 Interstate transportation. *>t Third, the authorization of the ap- It* polntment by the president of a small of body of men to observe the actual re- th suits In experience of the adoption of re the eight hour day In railway transpor- cc tatlon alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con- I gress of the consideration by the In- to terstate commerce commission of an m Increase of freight rates to meet such tl additional expenditures by the rail Li roads as may have been rendered nec- si essary by the adoption of the eight hour day and which have not been off- v< set by administrative readjustments hi and economies, should the facts dis- ol closed Justify the Increase. a' Fifth, an amendment ~f the exlsth;.. I" federal statute which provides for the w mediation, conciliation and arbitration 11 of such controversies as the present by rt adding to It a provision that, In case st the methods of accommodation now e( provided for should fall, a full public 111 investigation of the merits of every l)< such dispute shall bo Instituted and w completed l>eforo a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. 's Control by th# Executive. And. sixth, the lodgment In the ... hands of the executive of the powei |M in case of military necessity, to tnkc c, control of such portions and such roll lng stock of the railways of the coun- ni try as may be required for military Gj use and to operate them for military ei purposes, with authority to draft Into a] the mllitnry service of the United a] States such train crews and adminls c( tratlve officials as the circumstances u require for their safe and efficient use The second and third of these ret- |>, ommeiulatlons the congress immediate- cl ly acted on: It established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work 0 and wages In train service and It au- a thorlzed the appointment of a connnls- p alon to observe and report upon the g practical results, deeming these the a measures most Immediately needed, but n it postponed action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be a offered for a more deliberate consider- p ? ation of them. b The fourth recommendation I do not a deem it necessary to renew. The pow- c to Congress \ i ii ol Over Railroads ;i c a t O 

OPERATION OF RAILWAYS t! SHALL NOT BE STOPPED 1j To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before re- u ceiving the approval of society e in doing so would be to adopt a new principle into our jurisprudence which I tako it for grant- *1 ed we are not prepared to intro- b duce. But the proposal that tha b operation of the railways of tha e country shall not be stopped or g Interrupted by tha concerted ac- I, tion of organized bodies of men ^ until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall u make the whole Question at la. ue plain for the judgment of the C) opinion of the nation le not to c< propose any such principle. It is e: based upon the very different tt principle that the concerted action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial processes of the nation. s< m 6 tl to of the interstate commerce commls w mi to grant an increase of rates on ground referred to is indisputably car, and a recommendation by the tigress with regnrd to such a matter s' iglit seem to draw in question the 111 M'c of the commission's authority or to inclination to?do Justice when there os 110 reason to doubt either. es i'lie other suggestions?the increase pi the interstate commerce commls- q. :i's membership and in its facilities performing its manifold duties, the vision for full public investigation il assessment of industrial disputes, ul the grant to the executive of the iwor to control anil operate the railt.vs when necessary in time of war or her like public necessity?I now very mostly renew. New Legislation Necessary, rhc necessity for such legislation Is uiifest and pressing. Those who have trusted us with -the responsibility d duty of serving and safeguarding em in such matters would find It I_believOj tn excuse a failure to.. t upon fliese grave matters or any I I inccossory postponement of action. Not only does the interstate com-1 prrA pnirinikclnn u " 41 * ~ tmvi iv aeiitai impossible, with its present memberiip uml organization, to perform its eat functions promptly ami thorough- o , but it is not unlikely that it may esently be found advisable to add to (l] i duties still others equally heavy and ^ acting. It must tirst be perfected as tfl t administrative instrument. ^ The country cannot and should not )m nsent to remain any longer exposed (j( profound industiial disturbances r lack of additional means of nrbi- j ation and conciliation which the coness can easily and promptly supply, ad all will agree that there must be !" > doubt as to tlie power of the execu- M ve to make immediate and uninter- s ipted use of the railroads for the contitration of the military forces of the ition wherever they are needed and nl henever they are needed. 1 Tlds is a program of regulation, pre ntion and administrative efficiency r< hich argues its own ease in the mere atement ?f It. With regard to one of al i items, the increase In the efficiency ' tbo Interstate commerce commission. T 10 house of representatives has alady acted. Its action needs only the d< incurrence of the senate. ci To Safeguard Industrial Procesaas. I would hesitate to recommend, and rt dare say the congress would hesitate w > act upon the suggestion should I ^ ake It, that any man in any oecupa011 should be obliged by law to conuue in an employment which lie dered to leave. ?1 To pass a law which forbade or pre- u jnted the Individual workman to leave < Is work before receiving the approval < f society In doing ho would be to \ lopt a new principle into our jurlarudence which I take It for granted e are not prepared to introduce. But u >e proposal that the oiwration of the illways of the country Hhall not be v opiKsl or Interrupted by the concert- j 1 action of organized bodies of men I ntil a public investigation shall hare > M?n instituted which shall make the ;l hole question at Issuo plain for the P idginent of the opinion of tho nation < not to propose any such principle. g It Is based upon the very different ?i rinciple that the concerted action of d Dwerful bodies of men shall not be L>rniitted to stop the Industrial pro- 3 ?sses of the nation, nt any rate before ie nation shall have had an opportuIty to acquaint Itself with the merits r the case as between employee and nployer, time to form Its opinion upon a Impartial statement of the merits, ad opportunity to consider all practlihlc means of conciliation or arbitraon. I can see nothing In that proposition at the Justifiable safeguarding by sol?tv nf (llP iitk'PKmirv ir\t l(u ery life. There is nothing arbitrary r unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily nd unjustly done. It can and should o dono with a full and scrupulous reard for the interests and liberties of 11 concerned as well as for the permnent Interests of society Itself. Three matters of capital Importance wait the action of the senate which avc already been acted upon by the ouse of representatives?the bill which eeks to extend greater freedom of omblnatlon to those engaged In pre noting the foreign commerce of the ountry than Is now thought by some o be legal under the terms of the aws against monopoly, the bill amendng the present organic law of Porto tlco and the bill proposing u more borough and systematic regulation of he expenditure of money In elections, ommonly called the corrupt practices ct. 1 need not labor uiy advice that llOQO mnnclirno I nnnnliwl (nf<t In tt?

Immediate passage of the hill to reflate the expenditure of money In lections may seem to t?e less necesary than t'e Immediate enactment of tie other measures to which I it fer. ecause at least two years will elapse sfore another election In which fedral offices are to bo filled, but It would reatl.v relieve the public mind If this nportant matter were dealt with 'hlle the circumstances and the daners to the public morals of the.presut method of obtaining and spending ampaign funds stnnd clear under reent observation and the methods of xpemliture can be frankly studied In le light of present experience.
