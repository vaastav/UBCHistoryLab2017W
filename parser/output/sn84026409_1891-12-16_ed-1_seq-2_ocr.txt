The Somerset Herald. EDWAKD BCVtU Clitor and Proprietor. -. "f. 2M & ' P WZEJrESDXT.. Icn"otr 14, A Christmas approaches the pressure on the po-ket becomes more pronounoed. Ik Siaker Crisp comes to knotty ujtioii and doesn't know just how to run Congress, there is Tom Eeed on a front seat Landv. Every iine and every sentence of the President's message is notably American. "Stand by the flag" is the order that rings ont in every rounded period. iM'tAKER Ckp was a private in tbe Confederate army and was complimented for his bravery. He is the fret man low tbe rank of "colonel" we have heard of in the South since the war. This Michigan Democrats want the President to mind his own business and leave Michigan's gerrymander alone. That's what the Southern bulldoxers and the law breakers generally ask to be let alone. The President favors international bi juetalism, but he does not believe in free silver coinage as a means of bringing it about. The mine owners of the West are many of them agreed with him in that opinion. They are not all free silver advocates. Cosr.r.BMAS Spkisger is opposed to preparing and trying to pass an exhaus tive tariff bill like the Mills bilL Mr. Springer was in Ohio last fall and learned the sentiment of the people regarding tariff legislation. He discovered that the Mills brand of tariff reform is not popular. If the Democrats and republicans in Congress were nearer evened op Jerry Simpson might become a great man. As the matter stands he won't amount to "a yaller dog tied to the hind axle of the Land wagon." Jerry struck lolitics in the dark of the moon. Cosi,kex r-iit;Ei: is confident that the defeat of Mills will have no ef fect on the "paramount issue" next year. The "paramount issue" has received one black eye since November 1, and if the Iternocrata are willing to send it into the ring in that condition they should have the attention of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Tub llepublicans of ( thio are making arrangemt-cts to give Governor-elect Mc Kinley such an inauguration as has not been in the Buckeye State for many years. Republican clubs from every county in tbe State, the National Ouard, and Republicans generally will go to Columbus January 11 to show MtKinley that they are still in fighting trim and ready to keep the State in the Republican column next year. Messrs. Cnisr, Blount, and others in Congress, in renewing their old-time vonrtesy and complimenting Messrs. Reed, of Maine, O'Xeil, of Pennsylvania, and Ilolman, of Indiana, showed the spirit that should prevail in Congress. Men can be politicians and still remain gentlemen in the best sense of the word. It was a good start for the new Speaker, for which he should have due credit. President Harrison" sounded the death-knell of the Democratic party when he said in his message: "Rarely, if ever before, in the history of the coun try, has there been a time when the pro ceeds of one day's labor or tbe product of one farmed acre would purchase so large an amount of those things that en ter into the living of the masses of tbe people." The poor old Iemocracy have nothing to hope for now nothing to live for. Prosperity killed it the prosperity of the country. Tire Xew York 77m. thinks Governor Hill and Tammany are on top. It says : "H is not to be denied, therefore, that the election of Crisp is, to a marked ex tent, a triumph for the element in the Democratic party in this State repre sented by Mr. Sheehan, by Senator Hill, and by Tammany Hall." It adds: "That this result of the first deliberate action of the Democratic Representatives is, in our judgment, full of peril for the party and for the cause that has made the party in the recent past acceptable to us and to the great body of those who have come to its support within the past seven years, we need not say." Xow that the defeat of Mills has been effected and notice served on Grover Cleveland that the Iemocratic party is not his private preserves, the next thing in order will be to conciliate the van quished. Whether that can be done satisfactorily without stirring a fever of revolt in the blood of the victors may well be doubted. The patronage, includ ing desirable couintitteship positions, at the command of the Democracy is very limited. Mr. Crisp could hardly satisfy his own backers if he gave them every thing, and if he meets the demands, even half way, of the Millsites the cry will go up that he is placating his ene mies at the expense of his friends. Just at present there is a lalL Both sides can wait for future developments. Rut the daily press is not in a position to maintain silence. It is not built that way. The newjpapers of the mugwump stripe have no occasion to wait. They are immeasurably disgusted. It is said that Sherman Hoar, of Massachusetts, the most distinctive representative of that element, did not vote at all hen it came to the actual election for Speaker, and one of his colleagues followed his example. This was the logic of the situ ation. Whatever else the election of Crisp means it proclaims in a clear tone loud enough to be beard distinctly by every mugwump in the country, that is not to be a repetition of 18S3. If the mugwumps want to come in and be merged in the Democratic party, weil and good, but as for allow ing tbe tail to wag the dog again and the party to be cheated ont of half the spoils of victory civil service reform ideas, that 1s not to be tolerated. If Mr. Cleveland runs at all it must be as a leraocril, simon nre, and nothing else. The I emocratie press seems to be ttouteahat lildered. Evidently the magnates of that branch of the press were not prepared for hat happened. Kven those who fought Mills the root bitterly tlid not export much to win, and in an important sense they did not. It was not their victory. They were on tbe win ning side, but only as tbe fly was on the caach. Nrvtr was there a contest in politics which was more exdoMvely con fined, as a battle-field, to the politicians. It would be absurd to aay tbat publw sentiment in favor of Crirp had been worked up, or that the If ilia people had tt'ewpted to hatnatriag him by nets lpw auau'.ta. The a i!y politicians tuet at Washington and played a game upon the chess board without coiae. At aa point of the game was there any ' going to the country" lor consultation as to w hat move to make. The tone of the Democratic press, now that Crisp has "won out," shows plainly a dazed frame of mind. Even those editors who want ed Mills beaten are by no means certain they have got what they really wanted. There is a Russian proverb to the effect that to scratch a Cossack U to find a Tar tar, and in this case it is already evident that beneath the Cri?p coat beaU the heart of David B. HilL The Governor Senator was not in Washington himself. He was busy at Albany trying to steal tbe State of New York, an occupation which gave him great favor in the eyes of the Southern Democracy. It makes him their "blood brother." But it now looks as if his theft would not be accom plished. Public sentiment against the outrage is too strong to be resisted, and Hill will enter npon hia Senatorial duties immediately after the recess, covered with shame of defeat, instead of tLe pres tige of success, and the Crisp-Hill com bine will prove in still another sense the catching of a Tartar. Why Blaine May Decline, WasHiscros, D. C, Dec 13. In reserving last week the promise which he made in Washington on bis way from Augusta to Washington to attend the January 7 dinner of the Merchants' Association of Boston, Secretary Blaine disclosed tbe fact known hitherto only by their friends that Mrs. Blaine 'a health ia the cause of great solici tude to her family. He would keep hit promise, he said to the committee of the Merchants' Association if Mrs. Blaine' health would permit. It is re garded a entirely possible that her condi tion of health may be such at that time as to prevent Mr. Blaine from going to Boston. Tbe strain of the past two years, the death of her son and o fher daughter together with the stress of the constant attention day and night, which she has given her husband's health, have all told upon Mrs. Blaine's strength, ao that the change in her has been the cause of much sympathy among her friends. The friends here of Secretary Blaine say that if he is thinking of making the an nouncement of declination, which Harrison so confidently expects, it will be tbe condi tion of his wife's health, which would prompt him to it. Tbe Secretary may have to take Mrs. Blaine away for a thorough change and for rest in a more congenial climate. Blaine's Candidacy. Washisi.tos, V. C,Pec. 11. Hon. J. S. Clarkson, the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, held a conference this morning with Secretary Blaine. Last night Mr. Clarkson was with President Harrison for several hours. It is generally agreed by the Harrison and Blaine men that the question of Blaine's candidacy will probably be settled this week. If the name of Stephen B. Ei kins is sent to tbe Senate as the next Secretary of War it may be taken that Mr. Blaine will not be a candidate. Mr. Clarkson is undoubtedly now discuss ing the subject with tbe Secretary of State, and if Mr. Blaine communicates to the pub be it wiU be through Mr. Clarkson. It is desired to have the iuestkm settled before Clarkson starts on his Western tour. Congressmen Scared. Washisgtos, D. C, Dec li. About 1 o'clock to-day an explosion occurred in the ball of the House, making a noise that could be heard all over the building, and nearly causing a panic among tbe members and others present. The House was not in session, and not more than l'A members were in the hall, together with a large number of the usual hangers-on. Suddenly a report like the ex plosion of a heavy blast sounded through the building, and with a shout every man in the hall made a rush for the corridor. The explosion occurred in the corner of the ball nearest the Speaker's room, and the first idea wat that some one had thrown a bomb in that room. A volume of steam pouring through the hall with a roaring sound, however disclos ed the fact that it was merely tbe bursting of a steam-pipe used in heating tbe House. Some Coming Bills. Washisgto. , Iec It. When the House is in a condition to proceed to business, Rep resentative Kyan, of Nebraska, will propose a constitutional amendment that will, if adopted, permit any State so desiring to elect its United States Senators by the vote of the people. Another measure be lias in view is intended to correct an evil that he says ex ists to a certain extent in the Northwest. He proposed to compel tbe sale of all property under United States Court processes in the county where the property ia sold, and caus ing tbe advertising of the same to be like wise made in tbe county. Another measure he proposes to push to paisage if he can, ia one providing that after a certain amount has been realized tbe inventor of a patented article shall cease to be protected. Mills' Senatorial Boom. Galvistos, Texas, Dec. in The defeat of Roger Q. Mills for the Speakership has giv en widespread support, it ia said, to the ef forts of his admirers to elect bini to the United States Senate. . Governor Hogg has stated that an extra session of the Legislature will be called in March or April. The election of a successor to John M. Reagan will be one of the duties of tbe body. Senator Cbtlton holds his appointment from tbe Governor, and although a candi date for election by the Legislature, the friends of Mills are said to be confident of electing the tariff reform champion. A Second-Sight Baby. Hasover, Pa., Dec 1'!. In its first issue the Hanover Adranre publishes a remarka ble story of an infant prodigy, aged 20 months, the son of Joseph Rickrode, who lives near the Red Hill school-house, in Ox ford township, Adams comity. Young as he is, the baby has been a plain talker for nearly a year. But what is parti cularly wonderful is his apparent gift of second sight, if there is such a thing. Awaken tbe child at any hour of the night, ask birn the time, and without any hesita tion be will tell it to the minute without seeing or hearing a clock or watch. One night recently be aweke, and calling to bis father iu the same room, be cried : "Papa, to-morrow you will have to go to Bonnea'.:vil!e, because your uncle baa just died." On tbe next day Mr. Rick rote was inform ed of the death of bis relative, which, upon inquiry, was found to have occurred at the exact time the night before when the child had announced it. Young Kit Carson too Free With a Cun. La JrirTA, Coh, Dec 10 Kit Carton, jr., a of the famous old scout by the same name, to-day killed his aged father-in-law and mother in law and then made good his escape. About a year ego Carson married M j.-s Susie Richardson, but because of bis drunkenness and cruelty she was compelled to returned to her Cither ' borne, which is in Nine Mile Bottom, some twenty-five miles from here. To day Carson went to Mr. Richardson's house and demanded bis wife. The old gentleman refused tbe request when Carson shot at him, tbe ball passing through both hips. Mrs. Richardson, who was in tbe kitchen, beard tbe shot and hurried to tbe room where Carson was and was shot di rectly through tbe forehead, dying instantly. The murderer then mounted ber bora and escaped into Bent Can mi, beaded for New Me Wo. This b not the first shooting affair Carson has txan implicated in, and it cap tared this time there is svery reason to be I eve this one will be hi last. Typhoid and Diphtheria. Fran tee Fiti-lurgn Cwcaict- Tc"u irripb. Tbe Siate Board of Kealtnf s report touches upon UiphtU-ria and typhoid fever in a timely manner. It gives a warning of the contagious char acter of diphtheria and removts a wide spread misapprehension a to the contagious ness of typhoid fever. Diphtheria has been unusually prevalent in the past year, and at to this malady tbe report rays : " W bile the disease ia uuboubt ediy maintained, fostered and intensitUd by the filthy conditions which prevail in most of our small loans, yet tbe principal reason of its widespread existence and its long con tinuance in rre:ghborho--Khi is to be found in uninterrupted corouiunication between the sick, the convalescent, the inhabitants of in fected bouses and the well, and residents of uninfected houses. When we succeed in establishing this fact in tbe minds of people, and in inducing them to adopt tbe precau tions which it necessitates, we shall have rendered epidemics of diphtheria as rare as those of smallpox now are." As to thecontagionsness of typhoid fever, the report says : "This disease, on the con trary, is not spread by direct contact and in. fection. It is important that this fact should be as widely diKi-minaleU as the other. In an inspection made by tbe Secretary within the last month a hapless individual who, with several members of bis family, had re cently suffered from this disease, complain ed that tbe neighbors were all afraid that tbey would not come into the house, and be and bis family found it difficult to obtain the necessaries of life and nursing care. This belief prevails quite widely, and is en tirely unfounded. A well person may nurse a typhoid fever patient night and day with impunity, only taking tbe precaution not to eat or arms in tne sic room, auu iu drink no unboiled water." How to Preserve Potatoes. Tbe French Minister of Agriculture pub lishes tbe details of the process in tbe ofilcial ZJkWci'h du SlinUtere de t Agriculture for March 1S91. Tbe following ia a translation of the essential part of the scheme. I. The method of preservation consists in plunging the tubers, before storeing them away, for ten hours into a ' per cent, soln tion of commtrcial sulphuric acid in water; two parts of acid to 100 p;irts of water. 3. The acid penetrates the eyes to the depth of about one-fortieth inch (two milli meters1, which serves to destroy theirsprout. ing poser; it does not have any appreciable effect upon tbe skin of tbe potatoes. 3. After remaining ia the liquid ten hours the tubers must be thoroughly dried before storing away. 4. Tbe same liquid may be nsed any num ber of tiroes with tqually good results. .". A barrel or tank of any kind will do for the treatment. Tbe arid is so diludeit does not effect the wood. ;. Chemical analysis shows that potatoes treated by this process sre as nutritious and healthful after eighteen months as when frehly dug. 7. Potatoes thus treated are of course worthless for planting. Tried to Kill a Priest. Uoii.tDAVsr.i ao, l'a., Dec 13. An attempt to murder Rev. Father John Heine, of St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church, last night has aroued the people of this vicin ity, who sre making great efforts to locate the would-be assassin. Two murderous robbers pried open a win dow of tbe residence leading into the kitchen late at night. Tbey crawled through very duietly, felt about for tbe door leading up stairs where the priest was sleeping, and mounted tbe stairs. Rich carried a revolver in bis band. Father Heine was disturbed from his sleep by a click of of tbe door latch and arose and walkad into the halL Quicker than a Hash the burglars each fired a shot at him and fled. The pries was unharmed, but was so dated by the astounding reception be met that it wai a few minutes before be could give an intelligible alarm. A Pipe of Dynamite. Bostoic, Mara., Dec 10. A novel means to try to kill an Italian was employed by some unknown person last night. Angelo Marino, of Boston, is employed on the sewer at Faneoil, Mass., and his solace, after a bard day's work, has always been h s pipe. Lat night, as be was about to retire, be lighted the pipe. At the same moment there was a loud explosion, and tbe pipe was blown to atoms. When Marino recovered from the first shock of the explosion he saw that tbe ends of three fingers and a thumb on one hand had been blown off, and a bole was made through the knuckle joint of his third finger on the other hand. Somebody bad tilled the pipe with dynamite with the probable intention of killing him. Jewels in a Tramp's Lunch. F.ejk, Pa., Dee, !'. A lady's beautiful gold ring, set with rubies and pearls, unconscious ly given sway in a sandwich to a tramp that is the circumstatiee which has just come out in tbe tramp's hearing before an Erie magistrate Tbe tramp had called at an East Second street home and asked for bread. The young lady of tbe house took off her ring, laid it on tbe kitchen table, cut two slices of bread, unwittingly laid one on tbe ring, placed that slice over the other with its layer of meat, and tbus involuntarily gave away ber ring, which adhered to tbe bottom of tbe npper slice of bread. Tbe tramp's effort to sell tbe ring led to arrest, identification and recovery. Four Little Victims. Lancaster, Fa., Dec. In. Two of tbe chil dren of J. Lindman and two children of Isaac Hess have died during tbe past few days from diphtheria. The deaths have oc casioned considerable talk because it is learned that the little ones had not been at tended by a physician. Hess baa a daughter who was an invalid for years. She tock no medicine, but sud denly became well or at least thought she bad been restored to good health. Tben it was given ont that sbe had experienced a miraculous cure that she bad been "an notated." The family were not wholly satisfied of this, however, for this daughter began a course of medical reading; in other words, she studied medicine in a crude way, and sbe, it is understood, has been doctoring the children who have died. A Miserable End. West SirxBioa, Wis, Dec 10. Thomas K other came here in .1Sj.'J from Pennsylva nia, and that bis time has not been lest since tben (11 proved this morning when a neigh bor, alarmed at the old man's non-appearance, broke into bis residence and found bim stretched dead on bis bed, a pile of gold beside bim, a bundle of bills on tbe table, and a miscellaneous assortment of Government bonds, mortages and other se curities scattered on the floor. Wealth to the amount of over $Ji,Xi0 wss scattered about the room. Investigation showed that the ell man bad been engaged in counting bis wealth when stricken by heart disrate. He Shot the Farmer. MasMtLox, i, Dec. 11. Daniel Jones, a miner, who was hunting on Orlando Sto rter's farm, was ordered off by tbe owner. Instead f complying be deliberately shot the farmer, tbe contents of one barrel lodg ing in bis leg. The other barrel was also fired at Slotu-r, but missed him.

The Third Annual Session of the Somerset County Fanners JnJtlt ate, which meets la the Court House, January &th and -tb. promises to equal at least, if not exceed, in interest tbe sessions that have already been held. Hon. John A. Woodward, of Centre county, who was so highly appreciated by all who had tbe pleasure of bearing him two years ago, will be present to talk npon some special topic, and to take part in the general work of the session. Hon. Thoa. J. Edge, Secretary of the Mate Board of Agriculture, who is an " unabridg ed dictionary" of general Information on all subjects connected with Agriculture, will also be here, to give to tbe farmers of Somerset county, the bemfit of bis special training in this particular line. Mr. S. B. Heigf, 0 York county, who has a large experience in Institute work, has promised his presence, snd will not only aid in tbe general work, but will deliver a lect ure on geology or some other subject of spec ial interest to farmers, at some time during the session. Mr. J. T. Ail man, one of Juniata county's moat active farmers, and lecturer of the State Grange, will talk about " tbe good time com ing and how to help it on," and will prove himself an active " man of all work."' Wm. Fiear, Professor of Agricultural Chemistry in the state college, cornea to give ns light on tbe " chemical analysis of fertil izers, and the general relation that tbe sci ence of cbamistry bears to the agricultural industry." A number of ladies and gentlemen of our own county will read papers and discuss questions of special interest to farmers and their families. No work undertaken by our people in the past, has excited more interest than was manifested in the former sessions of onr County Farmers' Institute. They are regarded as a means of education that farmers and their families can not afford to miss. Tbe expenses are met by an appropriation, made by tbe State to tbe State Board of Ag riculture, and every farmer who wishes to secure bis full share of the benefit of this fund expended by tbe Commonwealth for tbe special benefit of his class, should not fail to be present. Application has been made for special rates on tbe railroad running through the county, which we have no doubt will be granted, as has been the case in tbe past. N. B.
