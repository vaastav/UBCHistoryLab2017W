It - be \*«Jl thus to deal with all these other matters, not one of them as important ns the Alaska boundary, and pot them out of the way forever. It ?s resliy *irange that they have been pr »nitted to dra; on »o Jonp. Canada is geo^rapb soa!ly ■■•} <t>mmerdally, as well as In some other respects, our BMal Intimate neighbor, and will always remain so. Relations between the two «*j'intries t-bould, therefore, be the most free irom dissensions »nd irritation. It would be to Vheadvaiita^r. of both countries that they should h*i so. Yet in fact for many years they have been maited with an almost Incessant recur rence of disputes, chief,-.- of a minor but none • ltfe less annoying character. Many efforts have b«a made, to nettle th^m. but all La re thus far \#fta thwarted, cften, U must be confessed, through la<4' of ■crillin^ness or of reasonableness '■ cue sfde or the other. The suspicion has In dted smen. apparently on pretty substantial I Bad tin* T&ere were those jr. t-oth countries ■ «■« nist only did cot wish to bate these contro- Irukl** settled, but Mm actually aM «f»reseiT« ly desired and determined that they sboujd not be settled if they could help it That disposition seems now very largely to have subsided, and we may confidently assume that an amicable and final settlement of the long pending Issues Is. now in sight. The obstreperous and obstructive disposition which we have described was manifested chiefly by those who favored, or professed to favor, either the commercial ■■ten or the actual po litical union of the two countries. Probably some of those visionary propagandists were sin cere and benevolent. They were certainly all deplorably misguided, as we have repeatedly in dicated. We ar<» indeed Inclined to think that nothing else has done half so much harm to Canada and to the relations of the two countries as the loose toughed chatter of commercial unionists and annexationists who have seemed Incapable of appreciating for a moment even a tithe of the gigantic problems, if not the insu perable difficulties, which their fantastic fads involved. It is of hopeful significance that all such talk has now subsided, and that instead of keeping np bickerings to force each other"? hands both countries are now practically intent on placing: their mutual relations upon a satisfac tory basis, as the relations should . be between two great nations which are bound always to be next neighbors and are almost equally bound always to be separate and Independent states. OOifMOX SEXSE AXD THRIFT. There has never In all our history been a more encouraging spectacle, so far as the material welfare of the nation is concerned, than that which Is to-day presented by the rarlon* gather ings and movements for the conservation of our natural resources and the fuller utilization of our natural facilities for commerce and Industry. It Is of course high time for such action to be taken. Tbe reckless profligacy and wasteful ness of this nation In the last two or three gen erations have probably never been surpassed, if even equalled, in ail the annals of human folly. Some of the damage which has been done is Ir reparable and must be bequeathed as a legacy of misfortune and deprivation to posterity. To whatever extent It Is possible to check and even to repair the damage, and happily such extent is still considerable, every motive of thrift and of duty, of prudence and of justice. Impels the na tion to prompt and energetic action. - - The ultimate exhaustion of coal, iron, copper and all other mines, oil and gas wells and simi lar resources is Inevitable. The reflection that this Is so, however, should dictate the most eco nomical methods in utilizing all those resources which are incapable of perennial renewal. It is notorious that in the coal, oil and gas industries there has been enormous waste. Some of It has been and is unavoidable. Much of it might be and should be prevented, and would have been prevented except for the shortsighted and selfish, policy which reckoned it cheaper to be wasteful so long as plentiful supplies were available than to be thrifty and saving with an eye to the fut ure. Thf-re has been too great an inclination practically to say. "After us the deluge" — use and to waste with lavish hand, leaving the prob lems of irreparable depletion and exhaustion to the unfortunate future. There are other equally Important resources, however, which under proper management will be perpetual, and which even the fullest use will not exhaust, though reckless misuse of them would destroy them as Mire.lv as those first named. These are the elementary resources of field, forest and stream — the soil, the trees and the supply of water for drinking, for power and, for navigation. It is an interesting circumstance that all three are inseparably united, the con servation of all three depending primarily upon the preservation nd cultivation of one. The equable flow of our rivers, so essential for navi gation and so valuable and of pneh Increasing value for power as the supplies of coal, oil and gas diminish, depend? absolutely upon the pres ervation of the forests as natural storage reser voirs. Upon the same conditions depends the protection of vast areas of fertile soil from be coming sandy and arid deserts. The meetings of the Rivers and Harbors Con gress, the Conservation Commission and similar organizations are therefore most encouraging. They indicate an awakening of the national mind to the urgency of prompt and radical re form Id our methods of dealing with natural re- Rources If we are to avoid Incurring, perhaps for ourselves and certainly for not remote posterity, the Irretrievable ruin which has overtaken other lands Especially urgent is the need of preserv ing our Eastern mountain forests, in New Eng land and throughout the "Appalachian system. For while forests on the plains may be replanted it is humanly and physically impossible to re place forests which have once been stripped? from mountain sides. For with the disappear •nee of the trees the sot] Is swept away, and nothing remains but steep wastes of naked rock, tie parents of alternate drouth and flood. And since the streams which proceed from these mountains are 'he most valuable of all, it is no exaggeration to say that the most urgent and the .most Important work of conservation of re sources now before this nation is the preserva tion and cultivation of whet remains of the for est areas of the White and Appalachian mom* talm CUBA'S VAIS FBARB. The T.mm«'nt& of a part of the Cuban p»-ess on the President's message which we reprinted the other day are a little surprising, and if they do not cause discouragement they at least cause regret that any cue in that Island should take so mistaken a dew of tbe President's words and should so misapprehend the disposition and in tentions of the American government and people. Sorelj the Cuban people have abundant cause to regard Mr. Roosevelt with gratitude and confi dence and to cherish the same feelings toward Mr. raft It would be Impossible to find two livln? Americans from whom respectively they have received and may expect to receive more benefits. We should think that the records of the two men and of the American government In gf-neral for the last ton years would forbid Cubans to Indulge the rain feari and unworthy suspicions which are now expressed. Referring to the American intervention of the bud two years, which was undertaken reluc tantly by our government at the urgent appeal ft the Cubans themselves, the President reminds the people of that Island that "the only way a "people can permanently avoid being governed "fro without is to show tint they Loth can and "will govern themselves from within." On what conceivable grounds can those words be esteemed unjust to Cuba, as one paper says they nre? They nro the statement of an Indisputable truth They contain no Intimation that Cuba Is notable and willing to govern herself from within On the contrary, they are Immediately coupled with a strong expression of hope and belief that 6h« la thus able and willing. Do our Cuban friends propose or wish to show that they cannot or will not govern themselves from within it is Inconceivable. Yet only if they did so could the President's words be rightly considered in any sense a menace to them, and even tben they would not be unjust Nor can it be maintained that there was no occasion for such a reminder in the President's message, seeing that twice In recent years the Inability or unwllUncness of Cuba to govern herself from within has made it nerespary for her to be governed from without and that at the argent request of the Cubans themselves. Still more unwarranted is the declaration of another paper that "at the fh«r political COnvul •'sion Mr. Taft is explicitly authorized to blot "out evon the name of the republic." That is so exaggerated as to be fantastic. There If' in the President's message not th* remotest hint of ••hat •Mr Ttfr will do or will not do in 307 

NEW-YORK DAILY TRTBTTtfrf. ST7NDAY. DECEMBER 13, 190,?. contingency. The intimation would be grossly offensive it It were meant at Its face value, which we have no idea it really is. Neither Mr Roosevelt nor Mr. Taft nor am other responsible American ever entertained any such notions a* tiiose which are conjured up by this Cuba.n paper. The United States originally intervene)! in Cuba apalnst the government of Spain, wliiea was then the only legal government of that isl and, in order "to secure In the island Ihe estab lishment of a stable government capable ft "maintaining order and observing Its internn "tional obligations, Insuring peace and tranquil lity and the security of its citizens, as well as "our own." The United States at great cost to Hself did secure that end, and of course it * i ■ not now mean to >t that end be lost But n lone as the Cuban Republic maintains a govern ment such as President McKlnley described in the word* which we have quoted it will be as free from Intervention as the United State- it self. That It will perpetually maintain such a status is the earnest desire and the present ex pectation of Mr. Roosevelt Mr. Taft and the whole American nation. 

FARES TO FLU ING. While, there probably will r-e the usual amount of complaint because of the decision of Public Service Commissioner Bassett on Satur day sustaining the 10-eent fare to Flushing, this decision, rendered on the merits of the case, will meet with the approval of all who will give the matter the careful consideration which is due such a subject, but which Is sometimes dispensed with in these days when popular clamor is assumed by come to be sufficient warrant for any action against a corporation. One of the economic principles which people are supposed to master early In life is that one can't eat his cske and have it. too. People living In Flushing, except such as were born in that villa go and consequently are creatures of cir cumstances, moved there, presumably, became it offered certain advantages not to be found in the more densely populated parts of the citr. Most of them took into consideration the fact that in return for the lower rentals, larger lawns and purer air they would have to pay more for transportation and spend more time on th* cars In reaching their homes. That the people of Flushing generally look at the matter In this light may be deduced from Mr. Bassen's statement that while the surface cars are run ning only partly filled during the rush hour, on a 10-cent fare, the trains are crowded with peo ple who pay a still higher price for the ride. As The Tribune brought out some time ago in connection with the 5-cent fere to Coney Isl and agitation, through traffic is the most un profitable business for a transportation com pany charging but one fare. And this is still more applicable to the" Flushing than to the. Coney Island line. It is a question if any way could be devised by which full cars of passes gers could be hauled from Flushing to the Brooklyn Bridge, a distance of fen or twelve miles, on a 5-cent fare, at a profit, taking into account the value of the plant cost of equipment and running expenses. To be sure, a person can, on the subway, by getting on the car at the Flatbush a venue- station and riding to Van Cortlandt Park, get fully as long a ride for a nickel, but were It not for the fact that in the course of such a trip the cars are filled tad emptied two or more times it is easy to Imagine that so generous an arrangement might easily bankrupt the operating company. It is the short haul passengers who make the profits for the streetcar companies, and the situation of Flushing Is so peculiar that there can be no valid ground for criticism of Mr. Basset?* de cision. THE PURPOSE OF THE VOBEL PRIZES. The recent bestowal for the eighth time of the prizes for which the inventor of dynamite pro vided in his will naturally invites a fresh, consideration of that munificent endowment Nobel's aim was to recognize handsomely such an exercise of the finest human faculties and instincts as might be expected to conduce most largely to the welfare of humanity.. Though his own pursuits were scientific, he did not limit his pecuniary encouragement to science. He was able to perceive the grace which literature adds to life, and also to realise the benefits which would result from putting an en! to war. On? of his prizes, therefore, Is awarded for literary excellence, another for the advance ment of the cause of peace, and three for scientific achievement One of the most remarkable features of the foundation, however. Is that it ignores the pro fession In which Nobel was himself trained. Like Ericsson. Nobel was a mechanical en gineer; at least, early in life. It might have been supposed that he would have had a lively appreciation of the service rendered to man kind by devotees of that branch of scienoe in the past: for Instance, In developing improved means of transportation and appliances for the operations of manufacture. He could not have imagined that that chapter of history had closed. For a man with his particular experi ence to show a preference for other departments of study must h* regarded as more or less strange. Perhaps the science of physics is the most ab struse and least practical of the three for con tributions to which Nobel prizes are awarded.' Among the researches which have thus far been honored are Inquiries into the nature and size of the atom, the characteristics of radium and the phenomena of radio-activity. Of these the only one which has yet had any useful application Is R(sntgen*s accidental discovery of X rays. Something may eventually come from Lipp mann's work in color photography, honored this year with the physics prize, but It has hardly been of service to Industry. Nobel's principal work, the invention of explosive?, primarily for blasting but Incidentally for military use, was essentially chemical in character. Hence it is easy to understand his wish to promote pursuits of a similar kind. In the eight awards for chemistry up to the present time, however, one can detect only two which have been won by achievements of present practical value. By perfecting the electric furnace llolasaa gave to his professional brethren a new Implement, and Fischer'? Investigation of uric acid may help to elucidate some of the problems of physiology. Van t' Hoff. Arrhenius and Yon Beyer have, Instead, contributed to the theory of chemistry. So has Rutherford, the prize winner this year, and Ramsay, who discovered « lot of new elements, for which the world has not yet found any use. * If comparatively little of this work appeals strongly to popular appreciation, such Is not true of thf. service to medicine rendered by the recipients of the medical prises. Koch, Bearing, Ross, I.nveran, Finsen. Pavloff, MetclinlkotT and Erllch have either bunted for the causes of disease or an effective method of fighting it. To lessen appreciably the varied suffering which comes from sickness (m d death Is a labor -that does more than Justify admiration. It !nsplr»»« universal gratitude. A 

DRAMATIC APPEAL. A strong appeal to Mayor ICcClellaa i filings was made at the hearing on the anti-ticket «p«c ulatlng ordinance on Thursday when a war vet eran laying: claim to having been an orderly to the Mayor'fl father pleaded that his occupation as a speculator Lfl not taken away from him. Th« Situation is dramatic. If we were putting It on the ttaga «•: should have Mr. McClellan yield with tears In his eye* to the heartrending petition of th% old soldier and veto the ordinance on th« spot amid the applause of the weeping gallery. To make it a moral as well as an artistic production, however, we should have to pi;tur« a Mayor, tempted to approve a wicked meagre, turned to a better course at the las* moment by the veteran* pl«» when all ©th«r araruTnents tailed. But the circumstances of this little drama of the City Hall are not behind the footlights, how ever closely they may be allied to those alluring fleams. They belong to th« everyday New Worker who has long suffered from that per nicious sidewalk pest the ticket speculator, and now sees, or hopes ho sees, deliverance at hand. "We believe the Mayo^wlll let no merely senti mental consideration warp his Judgment on the question before him. If he wants to complete this little drama In a style both moral and artistic let him abolish the occupation of his father's old orderly, and then, hT*bS finds the veteran's claim just, get him another employ ment where he may support himself in his de clining years. It has been generally understood that a Mayor can usually find a place for a friend when he wants to, and It Is even hinted that some of those Jobs are not too arcJwms for the failing strength of a man old enough to have been an orderly under General McClellan. If tt be true, as stated, that the membership of old St. Paul's Chapel has doubled in the last five years and that there are now 452 enrolled communicants, we must reckon that venerable shrine among the most active and progressive churches in the city and wonder with great amazement that any one baa «v*r thought of abandoning and destroying it. Mr. Castro seems piqued because he Is not taken in France as seriously as he takes him self. The point of view of Paris Is quite dif ferent from that of Caracas. If It is true that he gives twice who gives quickly, It Is equally true that he— more gen erally she — does Christmas shopping three times as satisfactorily to all concerned who does It both early In the season and early In the day. Tfc"? significant feature of the news concerning Che new Russian loan of $225,000,000 is not that such a loan Is tc be mad* &ut that the govern ment has regarded the approval of th? "Douma as an essential requisite to Its being made. Progress toward complete parliamentary govern ment in Russia may be slow, but It seems to be certain, and no backward steps are likely to be taken. There are some peculiarities of logic In Mr. Asquith's attitude toward the House of Lords. He concedes the competency of the Lords to de feat important measures which are adopted by the Commons. Yet he will not permit the Com mons to be dissolved "at th« dictation and Caprice of the upper chamber." He Insists that the House of Lords is "Irresponsible," yet in very Important matters he yields to Its power and declines to appeal to the nation against it. His course is doubtless the part of prudence, but it is doubtful If it results In much practical legis lation or In greatly strengthening the Radical demand for abolition of the Lords and the estab lishment of a Parliament of a single chamber.

General Count Millouttae, Minister of War under Alexander II The venerable general, who Is In Ma nlnety-tMrfl year, entered the army when he was seventeen.

But 'some day* fs for off. if one may Judge by what took place at tie recent parliamentary election. There can be no doubt that the Turks recognized the importance of the occasion, and that every voter felt that a new dignity had come to him. One voting place which I saw furnished a picture to Illustrate this fact. The election place was In the open, In front of a mosque. Beneath one of the Iron barred windows a table had been placed, and on this rested a trunk, of English make. This was the ballot box. Four soldiers and sev eral uniformed Inspectors stood near the table, and a curious crowd, from toddling boys to tur baned and bearded patriarchs, stood near, leaving a passag»vrar, however, for those who came to vote."

STATE PENSIONS. From Th« Klnaira Advertiser.
