LEGAL REMEDIES AMPLE SENATOR- SOMERVILLE THINKS CONSOLIDATION PROBLEM EASY.? Senator' George - -'■ W. - -Somerville, a, of Sleepy Eye, was at the capitol yesterday. He has given much thought to the rail way consolidation [question".? and believes' that legal remedies are. ample. _ -He says:. The law 'under which the Northern Se curities company? charter? was issued?is unconstitutional, 'in ? that it' confers spe cial privileges. Alt;permits r the corpora tion to buy stock in- various railroad companies, and carrying that out, it might under its charter j buy? up the stock of all the railroad' companies "in the country, shutting out;all,others; from ownership, in railroads. This would certainly be a spe cial : privilege. *-y, r ***-'- r? ■" L ' '-?.:' ?r A- If the Northern Securities company un dertakes to exercise " "any?.' control over Minnesota,, railroads or. to .vote at : their stockholders' meeting, it must come in under the laws of -Minnesota.
