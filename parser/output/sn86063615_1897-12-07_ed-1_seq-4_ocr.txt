THE PRESIDENT'S 31ESSAGE. Tho country has come to know President McKinley as a man of earnest convictions and strong common sense. All his past public utterances have accorded with this Idea, and nothing of a materlallj- different character Is ever expected from him. In his present message, therefore, there is no sur prise no disappointment. The presldent'has treated the great questions before the country In a practical, sensible way, in language that Is simple and easily under stood. His positions are wisely conserva tive, yet courageous and progressive. Ho speaks on the Important problem of cur rency reform, on Cuba and on annexation of Hawaii without any circumlocution or mincing. No one will accuse him of at tempting to straddle or to shift responsibil ity. Those who do not agree with him on these questions must concede that ho ut ters his honest convictions of what is best for the country- It remains to be seen how many of his recommendations con , grcss will accept, but no serious roistako could be made In accepting them all. The message is not too Ipng for popular reading. Considering tho Unusual number of important subjects discussed, it is re markably brief as compared with the av erage presidential jincssage. Mr. Cleve land's annuals usually contained about 20.000 words; this contains 12,000. It could not have heen shorter and have done jus tice to tho great questions treated As his first annual communication- to congress Sir. McKInlcy has given us a message that is entirely creditable from any standpoint considered, and that will be generally sat isfactory to the people more especially to the conservative business clement. . 

HCFOKM OF THE CURRENCY. After the Introductory generalities, the first place In the president's-1 message Is 'given to currency reform. This indicates that this subject is foremost In importance, in the president's Judgment." One of the two leading pledges of the Republican platform last year was restoration of tho protective policy; the other was 'preserva tion of the nation's financial integrity. The first of Usese was redeemed In the- enact ment of the DIncley bill: the second was redeemed-) as far as possible by. keeping the currency on a sound basis, but the im plied promise to revise the currency, laws and relieve the system of 'Its embarrass ing defects has not yet been, carried out. It is not at all surprising to find "President McKinley's conscientious mind impressed r with the duty of completing the fulfill ment of lhls pledge as early as practica ble. The plan of revision recommended by Secretary Gage is generally followed, show ing that the president and secretary of the treasury are fully In harmony on this subject. After pointing out the evils of the existing sjstem, and the great ex pense to the government of maintaining it thus handicapped, the president briefly presents the remedy which he believes will best meet the necessities bf the case, and without which there can be no cure. The "endless chain" method of depleting the treasury of gold must be rendered Impossible by a provision that only gold will be received In exchange for treasury notes. This remedy Is simple and will obviously be effective. The president spe cifically concurs with Secretary Gage In his recommendation that national banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of the bonds which they have 'deposited for circulation, and that the tax on such notes thus secured be reduced to one-half of 1 per cent per annum. He also believes that authority should be given to estab lish national banks with a minimum cap ital of $25,0u0. In order that the smaller -villages and agricultural sections may en Joy the benefits of the sjstem. and rec ommends that the issue of national bank notes be restricted to the denomination of 10 and upward. If these recommendations were carried out they would unquestionably relieve and strengthen the currency si stem greatly. They are in accord with the bet business sentiment of the country, and meet the approval of the most experienced and skillful financiers. But unfortunately there Is small likelihood that they will be cm bodied In any act of congress this session. The friends of sound money, nnd intelli gent financiering are not In a majority in the senate, and there is no probability that any reform of the currency can be effected however much it may be needed. AS TO IlEVTIIS I1Y 

ACCII7ENT. The Springfield (Mass) Republican re cently compiled a table to show that foot ball Is not accompanied by so many fatali ties as many other games and sports. The table presumably takes account of the pres ort j ear and shows the fatalities to have been as follows: Swimming l,350Ice-boatlng 22 Boating ld lHaeball 6 Hunting KJ3I 'Tennis , 4 Illcjrllng t2G4!Golf 2 Horseback riding "CSSjFootball 11 Upon the face of It this table would ap pear to make out a pretty fair case for football, but as a matter of fact It is v cry misleading. It takes no account of tho number of persons participating in the sponsor of the length of the season during which they are engaged In. No doubt the number who Indulged In swimming reached up in tho millions and the time during which the Fport was practiced extended over five months. Football is plajed only about six weeks In the jear. and the num ber engaged In It Is comparatively small. There arc several Interesting facts to be Cleaned from this table. One is that horsc- back riding causes more deaths than the blcjcle. We doubt If this would have been the guess of an uninformed person. Both together cannot equal the deaths from hunting. The deaths by land were 1,256. while tho deaths by water were S.33G, or nearly twice as many. We discqver by reference to the report of the Interstate commerce commission that the passengers killed upon railroads duiing the whole of ISM numbered only 170. or less than half as many as were killed by bicjcles. Feo ple who take out accident policies every time they mount a train, but who ride a blcjcle the year around without a thought of such a safeguard, ought to learn some thing from this comparison. TIIE JIEsStGE O.N CU1JV AND II VW'AII. That part of the' president's message re lating to Spain, and Cuba Is in harmonious keeping with Mr. McKinlej's conspicuous sense of justice and his high order of statesmanship. Its recommendations are patriotic, logical, diplom.-tic and humane. Deploring tho devastation and distress brought about by General Wejler's policv. but not excusing the Insurgents themselves for their frequent violation of the code of civilized warfar". the president rejoices in the inauguration of more humane methods by the new Spanish cabinet, and is ir favor of deferring Intcrv entlon on the part of this government until such a time as the new policies shall have been given A fair trial, and especially until the tenders of au tonomy shall hive been accepted or re jected by the insurgent authorities While there are manj people in the United States, some of them members of congress, who are ardent advocates of Im mediate intervention in behalf of the struggling Islanders, the prudence and jus tice of the president's position canrot fail to appeal to all who weigh dispassionately both the duty and the re-ponsibility of our government In dealing with this Important problem. After briefly reviewing the history of the Cubans and their various revolts against the parent government, and the severajl mediations on tho partjof the United States in behalf of peace, tho president takes up his message, delivered through Minister Woodford, and the answer of the Sagasta cabinet to that communication. The Wood ford message, which recited the gravity of tho war and the rights and interests of the United States In bringing about its con clusion, w as f av orably recclv ed by the Spanish government, which, under the note's construction, was not called upon to maVe any humiliating concessions, and ev en precise proposals were avoided In order not to embarrass the Spanish government. This strong- but conservative presenta tion of our cause Is shown, by the continu ation of the message, to have had the de sired effect. To quote: "Tnc reply to our noto was received on the 23d day of Oc tober. It Is In tho direction of a better .understanding. It appreciates tho friend ly purposes of this government. It admits that our country Is deeply affected by tho war in Cuba and that its desires for peace are just. It declares that the present Span ish government Is bound by every consider ation to a change of policy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cu ba within a reasonable time." In view of this clear recognition of our rights and purposes, and the large promises of the new Spanish ministry to make the desired concessions, and especially in tho light of reforms already Instituted, it Is both just and prudent that intervention at the present time should not be urged. The president's attitude on the Cuban question Is tersely summed up In one of the utter ances of this message: "There Is no desire on the part of our people to profit by tho misfortunes of Spain. We have only tho desire to see the Cubans prosperous and contented, enjojlng the measure of self control that is the inalienable right of man, protected In their right to reap the benefits of the exhaustless treasures of their coun trj" In reference to Hawaii, the president re iterates Us well known policies regarding the annexation of this group of islands. While disavowing any aggressive policy to ward absorption, he is convinced that, be cause of the repeated appeals of the Ha wallans for annexation, and a degree of commercial Intimacy between them and this country that must forever make their subservience to any other power than our own lrlmlcal to our interest0, there should be no longer delay in rntifjlng the treaty of annexation , w hlch has already been signed. TO 

CHECK CHIME. In yesterday's Journal attention was called to the menacing Increase In tho number of homicides in the United States, according to the statistics furnished by the celebrated criminologist, Cesaro Lomhroso. It Is evident from the facts then set forth that some effective means should be cm plojcd to counteract the increasing crim inal tendencies in this countrj, and for this reason it Is interesting to recall tho recommendations made bj the National Prison Association, which held its annual session at Austin. Tc , last week. Tho committee on criminal law reform, whose report was unanimously adopted, suggested tho following reforms: "Greater severity of punishment, doing away with all technicalities in trials, abol ishment of jurj, making conviction more summary and trial more speed ; depriving defendants of the right to appeal to a higher court; offering rewards for the dis covery and conviction of criminals; steril ization of defective--, both moral and phvs Ical; abolishment of povertj; removing or restricting the power to pardon; prohibit ing the use of intoxicating liquors; r-con-structlon of the ethical code of lawvers. curing inherent defects in the law as dis tinguished from its enforcement; develop ing a scientific motherhood; state rcguli tlon of marriage; restricted Immigration; popular education and colonization of criminals; the'reformation of criminals by the abolition of the definite sentence " The committee frankly admitted that some of these modilicalions are practically Impossible at present, but expressed faith in the good results of a general effort to follow them so far as feasible. Among the most reasonable and practica ble of the recommendations here made are those touchlnjg the jury sj stem, the rsort to technicalities, tho unreasonable delajs In trials, restriction of the pardon power, the reconstruction of the lawjers' code and tho reformation of criminals. A phase of our jury sjstem that has been little discussed, but w hich is account able for man) miscarriages of justice, is pointed out bj Mr. Arthur H. Dunn In the current number of the Criterion. Mr. Dunn asserts, and with much reason, that elo quence should have no place In the court of Justice. "We are led to believe," ho sajs. "that truth nnd only truth is to be brought out. Eloquence, as manifested by oratory, is lrlmlcal to truth, which can only be established by calm, unprejudiced and dlspasslonato investigation. I hold that for the accomplishment of justice all theatric displajs, all eloquence, all excit ants to the emotion, should bo banished from our courts of law, by sentiment If not by regulation." Mr. Dutton's arguments appeal with par ticular force when It Is remembered that In many criminal cases, especially cases of homicide, which have attracted wide spread attention, it is almost impossible to secure an intelligent jurj because of the enforced exclusion of all readers of news papers. The available juries are often strangely dull to logical reasoning but keenly susceptible to emotional appeal. But the Increase in crlma and the mis carriages and delajs o justice have aroused such general concern and provoked so many protests that it is reasonably eertain that beforo the end of the century comes we shall see many helpful reforms Instituted If not, we Mi ill soon become an enigma among the nations of the world -claiming the greatest enlightenment and exhibiting the largest number of jcrimes. The selection of Governor Griggs, of New Jersey, as Attorney General McKenna s successor Is not only a hign compliment to Governor Griggs but Is a deserved recog nition of New Jersej's entrance into the Republican column. The fact th it such a responsible office is to be conferred on him by President McKinley is sufficient evidence that Mr. Griggs is well qualified. The president makes no mistakes In choos ing his official advisers. Democratic organs are chuckling over the "fight" in the Republican party of Mis souri. The Democrat organs are In error. There is no light in the Republican party of Missouri. They havo probably been misled by the spectacle of Chauncey I. Filley, of St. Louis, spouting mud. . The fact that eight of tho jurors In tho Goddard case were for hanging Indicates that public sentiment in Jackson counts is at last becoming aroused. Murder is not alwavs to be a privileged crime in this community. The president's message Is said to have had a favorable effect on American securi ties abroad. As it also has a favorable ef fect on business at home it may be re garded as a i-ort of international soothing sj rup. Champ Clark does not indorse the presi dent's Cuban policy. As the president has just publicly announced his policy it is dif ficult to see how ho is going to manages to get into line with Champ. President McKlnlej' does not despair of International bimetallism. Nevertheless the president, would probably admit privately that the chances are more than sixteen to one against it. Italy Is grossly unmindful of her oppor tunities She permitted her ministry to re sign in a body w ithout declaring a crisis. Congress was called to order yesterday, but there is nothing to show that Jerry Simpson feels himself bound bj the call. A careful reading of the piesldcnt's dis cussion of tho Cuban question is recom mended for that inflamed jingo feeling. 

KANSAS TOPICS. If Albert Griffin could have had one more issue of his paper before the wreck came he would have denied the existenco of his God. "I suppose," said a reader of The Jour nal jestcrday. "that the reason the other Kansas City newspapers do not print that kind of a headline Is because they have no red tjpe." The moral drawn by Governor Riddle from the death of tlnt'Ellls joiing man who drank bedbug poison is: "Alnavs make sure that It Is whisky beforo jou raise the jug." Kansas alwav s gets into It. Bert Branin, of Lawrence, his shipped ns messboy up on the revenue cutter Bear, which has gone to the rescue of the Ice-bound Be ring se.a whalers. The Hiawatha World sajs that when Web Wilder, Jr.. graduates from the state uni versity next June he will read law in the office of Gleed, Ware & Glecd, at Topeka. Announcing the arrival of a baby at his house, A ill Huff, editor of the Huron Her ald, sajs: "We would not take $10 000 for this one, nor give 50 cents for another." Representative Burkholdcr. of Marion county, has taken time bv an extremely long forelock He sajs that if his people want him he will run for office again. The news comes via Governor Morrill and Web Wilder that Colonel S W. Eld ridge, of Lawrence. Is writing a history of earlv dajs in Kansas Tho fact that Oskaloosa has four drug stores and onlj- one meat market would seem to he corroborative of the scientific stateirent that man drinks four times as much as he eats. Tint Kansas is in the habit of mixing a decorous amount of grnvitj- with her gajety would seem to be Indicated by the following extract from a Jewell county marriage notice: "The principals to the happy and jovous occasion stood beneath a floral marriage bell, where they were made one by the solemn and serious pas tor of the bride's church." a "William Gage." sajs tho Great Bend Tribune, "was married on Thanksgiving diy to his divorced daughter-in-law. He thought as he had to take care of her anvw.aj that he might as well have her in the famllv " If this from the Atchison Champion does not exploit a genuine case of v, hip-saw -lng the game, somebody will have to show us: ' James W. Orr Is back from Lincoln, Neb, where he won his lawsuit where the Mis. souri Pacific company was sued for J10.000 for burning a warehouse. Mr. Orr put a Burlington engineer on the stand and he testified in effect that his Burlington engine set the fire. The statutes o limit ation have run against the Burlington. Some of the Southern Kansas papers are booming Judge J. S West, formerly of Fort Scott, but now a resident of Kan sas City, Ka . for associate justice of the supreme court on the Republican ticket. Judge Allen will undoubtedly be renom inated by the Populists. On two occasions Judge West ran against Judge Allen for district judge and beat him both times. Here is food for the believers In omens. Application has been filed for the par don of Chris Stegman, a convict In the penltentlarj from Rush coimtj- who, Is un- "der sentence of seven' ears for criminal as sault upon a voung girl. He was convict ed less than a ear ago. His wife and the assaulted girl have united in asking for this pardon and the petition in favor of It is numerousl signed by the Russians of Rush and Ellis counties. Something like seven jears ago Stegman was convicted of perjury In the United States court at Topeka. the presiding judge being Judge Riner, who -was tempor arily sitting for Judge Foster. When hewas brought in for sentence Eugene Hagan, his attorney, made a speech in which he related that Stegman had a wife and nine children who would be left without means of support. He asked that Judge Rlner delay sentence until the prisoner could return home and put In a crop. Mrs. Rlner, who had uccompanled her husband to Topeku. was touched by the story of the nine little children, and she Interceded with her husband', who finally granted Ha gan's request. Once each year for four ears Stegman was brought Into court to receive his sentence, but each time Ha gan secured Its postponement on the ground that his client had not jet suc ceeded in raising a crop. It was a fact that the crops had been a complete or partial failure in all these jears. About the time Stegman was to be brought Into court for the fifth time he committed tho assault upon the girl nnd was taken In hand by the state authorities The pen alty for perjurj' therefore Is still hanging over him and will likely be applied it Governor Leedy Is influenced to pardon him. A little Topeka girl was recently told by her mother that under no circumstances must she use the word "nigger," as it was offensive to the colored people. The next day at school she was requested to read aloud about a niggardly m in and she astonished the teacher bj reading in this wise: ) Once upon a time there vv.is a very negrogardly man," etc. On October S James T. Nolan, a Iawjcr of Hajs City, escaped from the Ins me asvlum at Topeka. Vigorous search was made by his wife and famll, but not the slightest trace of him could be uncovered, and it was at last concluded tint he h id commltteel suicide. Last Siturdny Mrs No lan received a letter from an aunt of Mr. Nolan's at Buffalo, N. Y.,lnforming her th it the crazy man had landed there safe and sound and was being cared for. When Mr. Nolan left the asvlum he had no money and it Is a mster how he got so far. The mother of Alonzo HInes, of San An tonio. Tex , came to Atchison countv a couple of weeks ago to visit relatives When she cot ready to return a telegram was sent to Mr Hlncs as follows- "Mother start ed to-night." When the dispatch was re ceived b Mr. Hlncs it read: "Mother died to-night." He at once started for Atchison and did not learn the truth ifntll his arrival there. He had passed his mother on the road. A tramp went Into Mnnspcaker's grocery store at Topeka the other day, where he noticed a big box of soap labeled, "a cake for 1 cent." He approached Mr. Man speaker and said: "I am broke, but If jou will trust me for twent-flve cakes of that soap I will pay jou in less than an hour." Manspeaker had a curloslt to get onto the tramp's game and consented to the deal. The tramp took the soap over to where the plug tobacco Is kept and carefully wrapped each cake in a bit of tin foil procured from the tobacco boxes. He then went out upon a street corner and announced to passers by that he had for sale "the genuine Arabic frankincense ambrosial shaving soap, guar anteed to soften the hairs of the face until a dull knife could cut them and certain to last ten times as long as anj- other soap In the. market " Inside of half an hour he had sold ever- cake at 25 cents each. He paid Mr. Manspeaker 25 cents and walked off w ith a clear profit of $6 In his pocket. The Hutchinson News relates the follow ing storj- of an amusing error made by ona of its newsbojs the other da: Among the passengers waiting at the Santa r depot Wednesday evening for pas-erger train No 5 was a gentleman of middle i K2 who avoided the crowd and seemed to be content with pacing the platform alone. His quietude was broken bj .t nevvsboj- mere adventurous than the rest. Tho bov bus tied up with his bundlo of papers and shouted to the stranger, "Av ant to buy a psper, mister? All the latest telegraph happenln's." The stranger shook his head and turned awaj-. But the boy was per sistent and continued: "Mebbe vou want to know how tho markets is? All tho lat est market reports. Buv a paper? ' But the stranger said ho didn't cate about the markets. To have the last word, the boy said: "Saj, mister, jou look like a good Republican. Here's nil about the hole the Tops are making in tho state treasury." The stranger laughed, and said: "Heres jour nickel, sonny. ou've earned It. Give me a paper." The nevvsboj- carried the day nnd paid no attention to tho grinning crowd which had gathered. Tho man wro "looked like a Republican" was John W. Leedy, of Topeka, governor of Kansas. The official report of Major Wood-on, agent for tho Cheenncs in Oklahoma, to tho secretary of tho interior, brings the Information that the trials and tribulations of too much mother-in-law are rot confined bv any means to tho Caucasian, but maj bo found as well In the domestic affairs of his red brother. The major sajs: 'Tho mother-in-law is much in evidence among these people. She makes herself a 'holy ter ror' unless the famllj- affairs are conducted according ito her Ideas. Much of the agent's time Is occupied In the settlement of family quarrels nnd bringing together husband and wife whose troubles have been of sufficient gravltv to cause a separation. His powers of persuasion are frequcntly excrted In vain, however. In most In stances the wife, backed up by the mother-in-law. Is most obdurate nnd proof against all argument and entreaty to return to the f.imllj- abode." 

MISSOURI POINTS. Evidently the weather cut considerable ice in Jefferson City yesterdaj- even though the dealers wholly failed to carry out their announced purpose of doing so. "The Only McQnltty." of the Rocheport Commercial, Is credited with the discovery that Brer Brjan, in eating 'possum with the Century Club at Columbia. bound himself still closer to all Mlssourlans. In connection with the rumor that Edna Whitney contemplates taking tho stage, the Springfield Republican ventures the suggestion that If she will onlj take It far enough awaj- the people will interpose no serious objections. Tho Cole Countj- Good Roads Club, in pursuance of Its purpose to keep the sub ject beforo tho people, has arranged for oiling a convention of clubs from all ad jacent counties, the meeting to be held at the capital the latter part of January.

A peculiir feature about this lovemak ing Is this: Columbia girls quite otten marry students from abroad and go away with them; but Columbia bos seldom mar ry university girls ami bring them back here to live. Is this because unlversltj Lojs are more attractive than university girls or because they are harder to catch? Or can It be because our home bojs are less enterprising than our home girls and do not take advantage of their opportu nities? V Judge Dorsey W. Shackleford, of Boon ville. Is freemently called upon to act as special judgo outside his own circuit. He is recognized also as one of the ablest judges In tho state. Hej believes in con victing the guilty and does not waste much timo In vexatious delajs. Some time ago, as a writer In a reminiscent vein relates, ho was called to St. Louis to try Oj case. After hearing evidence all daj- he adjourned the court until 8 o'clock the next morn ing. "Eight o'clock, jour honor." said one of the supercilious St. Louis attorncjs. "Eight o'clock! Why. in tho citj- our cltj judges never begin to hold court until 10 o'clock." "Well." said Judge Shackleford, "if jou must have country judges jou must bear with country wajs. Court will meet at R o'clock while I am on the bench." And court did. On another occasion Judge Shackleford granted a change of venue from St. Louis to Cooper countv. Ex-Governor Charles P. Johnson was the defendant's counsel and had looked up the regular terms of court In the Cooper countj- circuit and found that there was no regular term for some months. As he was very anxious for deiav. Gov ernor Johnson was much surprised when, after granting the change of venue. Judge Shackleford s-ald: "I will set this case for a week from next Monday." "But, jour honor, there Is no term of court in Boonville feir several months." "You are mistaken, governor," said tho Boonville judge. "I live In Boonville and hold court at any time. Moreover, the constitution guarantees a speedj- trial and I am sworn to support the constitution." But a speedj- trial was just what John son didn't want for his client, and so he ccntimieel: "I can't be In Boonville during that month. That will be my regular vacation." "You hear what jour lawjer sajs." re marked Judge Shackleford to the prisoner. "Your trial will begin at the time stated, and if Governor Johnson cannot be present jou would better arrange- to have some one elso to represent you." The trial came oft as stated and Johnson was on hand. How to Hie a Century. Dr. Horatio S. Brewer Ins written an article under the above caption which is interesting from the various theories ad vanced, even if one is skeptical as to their application, calling attention to the fact that man's life begins in a gelatinous form and ends in a bony form, unless it Is cut short by accident or disease. The doctor goes on to saj- that the human form is soft in Infancy and hard in old age. Ossification of the tissues begins early and is kept up until death, but the osslfj ing process becomes m irked after middle age Is pist. sajs A hat to Eat. AVherever the blood flows It deposits earthy matter, which affects all the phjslcal organs jnml materiallv interferes with their functions when in excess. The hcirt and arteries are clogged by It and the result is imperfect circulation of the blood, upon which nu trition depends. Eminent phjsicians claim that If repair of the tissues 6y nutrition was not interfered with life would be pro longed lndeflritelv . tint the greater num ber of people past GO suffer more pr less from arterial ossification, which brings about obstruction in the proper and healthy circulation! ot the blood. The blood Is produced J bj the food we eat. hence we must look to the food for the earthv accumulation, which in time blocks up the sjstem and produces old age. Bread and meat, man's diet for ages, are, after GO. the staff of death. Fruits, nuts, certain vegetables, with distilled water, should be the diet at that age.
