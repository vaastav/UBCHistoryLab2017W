Butler takes the Judiciary Committee, Hale, ofNew York, the District of Co lumbia, a very important committee . The New York Siaats Zettvng does not like the selection of Wood, as ihe Democratic standard bearer. It is Ttainocratic. but that is a liih too much. It says: The electioh of Wood as tbeir leader is disgraceful, not only Vcauae he is a formal defender of tne "grab," but is above all a man who represents every thin.F with which Democracy should not be identified. We do not say too much when we affirm that he inaugu TAtari the Rvstem ot corruption in this city, which Tweed brought to perfec t inn. It reauires a good share of blind ness to select Wood at the very moment when Tweed was sent to the Peniten tiarv. The Democratic Congressional caucus have fully proved to the people of the United States, that in electing a Bepublican Congress, they (the people) Chose the lesser of the two evils. The Democratic minority, led by Wood, is destined to contempt at Washington, because it is despised aoc" mistrusted everywhere, What the Newspapers say ot the Message.

Taken as a whole the present is per haps, the ablest message yet delivered by President Grant. There is no effort at rhetoric, but the document is terse and compact, and expresses clearly and intelligently the thoughts and opinions sought to be conveyed. It will well repay careful perusal. Wucago Inter- Uoean. The President's message, like all his published declarations, confirms the impression of his desire to do what he considers best for the general good and leaves unaffected the impression that in the discussion of the financial and eco nomical questions he simply repeats the views of certain of his counsellors, lie is a patriotic and honest Executive, and popular confidence in him is still strong.

The wisdom of their foresight has been justified by the re- suits. A great Nail mill and furnace, numerous glass factories, besides minor industries have risen like magic, and wherever located have drawn after them population, stimulated building and in every way advanced the importance of the place. Water and gas works have been built, and in all the appointments which characterize a city, she is far ahead or many older and larger towns. We pre- sent this morning such notices of her! specialties as we were enabled to make during a lew nours' visit one uay inst week. THE BELMONT GLASS WORKS. are the Pioneers of her manufacturing interests and are situated on tne west side of the town. They were built by Rarnes and Fauoel in 1866. and their specialities were table ware and lamps. The firm conducted the business witn until the close of 1868. when joint stock company were formed, un der wnose auspices operations xiave continued since Jan., 1869. Up to the close of 1872 the profits of the business was verv large, uv tne iuqicioub ex penditure of their surplus the product ive capacity of the works has been made commensurate wun its great trade. The company give employ ment to one hundred and fifty-five per sons; the toiai sales ior toe present vear will foot np one hundred and fortv-five thousand dollars. The offi cers of the company are Messrs. James Hobbs, President, and w. iv. uoruy, Secretary. THE 

STAR GLASS WORKS are also situated on the west side of the town, and are the property of J. H. Sullivan & Sons. The commencement of the works was in March, 1872, and their completion and operation in the month of July in the same year were consistent with the characteristic ener gy of the senior member of the firm. Lamp chimneys are the exclusive pro duction of this establishment. It has an eight-pot furnace and is worked in daylight only. It is perhaps in all its appointments the most compactly ar ranged factory in the city. Mr. Sulli van estimates the tirt year's business at seventy-five thousand dollars and expects a showing considerably in ex cess of that for the current year. THE NATIONAL GLASS CO'S works are located south of the creek, and were built in 1870 by James Cran gle, of Wheeling, and designed for the exclusive manufacture of pressed ware. The concern from some cause was very slow in stating, and was finally con verted into a joint stock enterprise, of which John T. Mercer is President and H. C. Waddeil, Secretary. The '.first and second years, for reasons iucident to iuexperience, were unsuccessful, re sulting in a reduction of its capital by about fifteen thousand dollars. Nothing daunted, however, the Company in the face of disaster changed front, and turn ed their works upon lamp chimneys alone, blown ana moulded. Success immediately followed the change. The result of the current year's business will foot up between ninety and one hun dred thousand dollars, with flattering prospects for a large increase of business ill luo i-uuiiug jcni. THE

The capital of the Company was not so large as mat oi some oi inesimiiar con cerns, but their business has been pro portionately successful. Their produc tion is also exclusively lamp chimneys, with an average turn out of 750 boxes per week, approaching an aggregate value ofseventy-nve thousand dollars per annum. THE

The company was organized in the spring of 1872, with S. M. Sheets, President, and G. W. Sandeis. former ly of the firm of Brues & Banders of this city, Secretary. Active operations commenced on tne zam ot Kept., 1872, and from the start were a perfect suc- 8.

Many guests from Pittsburgh and other places were pres ent. They had marcning with ban ners and brass bands; they had a ser mon and a banquet and toasts, and jolly good time. Ex-Senator Updegraff, of Mt. Pleas ant, in response to the toast "The State of Ohio; the third in the bright galaxy of States," found a theme wor thy of being talked about. We present a specimen of his admirable condensa tion of the richness and greatness our Buckeye State: Thirty-seven sovereign States, clasp ed bytbe endearing name, "Uur uouu try," form our national family. Among these, umo, graded by population, takes the "third" place. In growth variety of resources and products, loca tion, progress, education, - benevolent institutions and national influence, holds a rank second to none, in 1810, when New York stood first and Penn sylvania second in white population Ohio was ninth. Since that time progress has been such a miracle growth and prosperity, that its history and statistics seem a fable and a false hood to the amazed people ot older and slower countries. In 1870 its constant ly increasing population was 2,655,260, Last year the aggregate assessed value of its daily augmenting, real and pei sons! property, was $1,624,323,118. true value of the same is set down $2,335,463,394, or about four times what it was in 1850. There are in the State 20,000,000 acres of cultivated land, which last year yielded over $200,000,000 worth of farm products. There now $141,924,000 invested in manufac turing, supplying 137.200 men with bor, and yielding last year a product $300,0U0,U0U. In 1871 there were mined 55,315,666 bushels of coal, and geologists compute the amount of available coal in State to be 23,000,000,000 tons, and new sources of supply are being constantly discovered, xnesuppiy already knon would furnish the vast amount mined last year for more than 30,000 years, Of pig iron, that standard staple modern industry, unio, in isvi, manu factured 353,0o0 tons. Kvery ton iron represents about twenty-tive days' work, us nearly 85 per cent of its value is tne labor it involves. That amount of iron manufactured , then means 825,000 days' labor, worth $14,737,500, or the constant employment of 32,750 workmen, and tie support of 163,750 American men, women and children. But lietter and gntnder far than these proofs ot material proenerity comes the crowning fact that during the past year Ohio has expended more than $7,000,000 for educational purpo sed in furnishing the meaus of knowl edge to every child of every class and condition within - her borders.
