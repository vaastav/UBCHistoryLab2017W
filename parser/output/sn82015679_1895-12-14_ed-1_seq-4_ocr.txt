The "comfortable surplus" of which the treasury officials speak with so much assurance was a deficit of J2.000.000 dur ing the first nine days of December. That which la making life a burden to Congrensmen at present Is that there are so many high-priced applicants for ofHce and so many low-salaried places. Controller Johnson will please taxpay ers by declaring that no larger levy Is needed for the city, but the taxeaters. who have visions of larger expenditures, will be angry. The presence of Henry Villard among the clvll-service reformers is calculated to provoke cynical comment on the part of those who have been victimized by his railroad schemes. Having abused his own country In England, the only way for Mr. Bayard to even matters up is to come home and abuse England in this country. But that he will never do. The retail price of whisky In Chicago has been reduced to 5 cents a drink, or three for a dime. This will probably secure the Democratic national conven tion against all other bidders.; It Is proposed to increasethe license fee for saloons in Kentucky in order to pay off the State debt. If such a meas ure shall increase the price of a drink of "sour mash" there will, be trouble. The New York Herald: Fays that Mr. Cleveland has recommended a , popular loan. If that loan Is intended to be used in. retiring all the greenbacks within a brief period It will not be popu lar. " If the majority in the House show as much Intelligence, alertness. Industry, zeal' and energy in looking after the public Interests as they have In divid ing the House patronage they will make a fine record. It was not that the late Judge Thur man was usually on the right side of public questions that he won public re spect, for such was not the case, but it was because of his high integrity In the discharge of public duties. Senator Peffer's effort to abolish con gressional funeral junketing excursions ought to be successful, but it will fail, as would an effort to cut off mileage, stationery allowance or any other con gressional abuse. Congress never re forms Itself. When Mr. Mawdsley. an English dele gate to the American Federation of La bor meeting, said he felt pretty sure that If he were a capitalist he would be as wicked as the other capitalists, he showed he had a good deal of common sense and honesty. Several Chicago papers have figured it out that St. Louts cannot take care of the Republican national convention; nevertheless, those who know that city and its people will not worry lest those who go to the convention will be com pelled to sleep out doors. When Minister Thurston, of Hawaii, permitted himself to be Interviewed and In that interview criticised the adminis tration, he was sent home; why should not Embassador Bayard be recalled for slandering a large part of the American people before a British audience? A Washington special to the Louisville Courier-Journal says the President's at tention will be called to the Flemings burg postoffcee case as soon as he re turns from his ducking expedition. So the British-Venezuelan controversy and the Cuban question must still give way. The report that the President had re turned from duck hunting was prema ture, and, so long as he is having luck, of -what consequence can It be to him that the American people are anxious to know the contents of the Salisbury let ter, which will not be made public until he returns? The Republicans in Washington must do something besides attacking the Pres ident. As a rule, the Representative Barretts must be held in check. No party ever won confidence by simply as sailing their opponents. To retain an advantage they must do something worthy of It. It la said & bill will be Introduced pro viding that fourth-class postmasters that fa. those at small offices, shall be elected by the people. Such a law would probably result in more frequent changes of postmasters than occur now, whereas public Interests would be served by less frequent changes. It will be noticed that the price of Trheat dropped because of foreign ad vices regarding the supply. It was not ccorcity of gold, the noncolnage of silver or anything of that sort, but the fact that rather more wheat was seeking the European markets than is needed by consumers. GOV. 

3IATTIIEVSS FOOL FRIENDS. Every prominent public man has among his followers and supporters some who possess zeal without knowl edge, and who, through ignorance or recklessness, are apt to do him more harm than good. They belong to the class of people who "didn't know it was loaded." In common parlance, they are styled "fool friends." As Governor Matthews has reached the dignity of being a presidential can didate, or aspirant, it would be strange If he did not have fool friends. In fact, they are a necessary adjunct of any presidential boom, a sort, of badge of genuineness and guaranty of good faith. All the same they require watching. Just now the Governor's fool friends are pointing the silver gun at him without knowing it is loaded. Of course, they do not mean to hurt him, and they will not believe it possible for him to receive any injury from an unloaded weapon until It shall go off and kill him. Then they will be very sorry, and wonder how they could ever have been so foolish. The conference of Wednesday showed beyond any doubt that the free silvet Democrats of Indiana Intend to press the issue and Insist on a free silver plank in the next State platform. In the rough-and-tumble discussion of the question which was accidentally precipi tated' in the conference they showed a .numerical majority and decided ag gressiveness. They talked like men who had knives In their boots and would use them If necessary. Unless some thing Is done to head them off they will capture the next. State convention and adopt a free silver platform. All these free silver Democrats are In favor of Governor, Matthews for Presi dent, as they ought' to be. As a Demo crat in good standing and the only possi ble Democratic candidate In Indiana, he should, of course, have the united sup port of his party in this State. There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of these free silver Democrats In-their friendship for Governor Matthews, but there is much reason to doubt their, wisdom. They forget that Indiana alone cannot nominate a candidate for President, and that the Democracy of the Eastern States will have nothing to do with a free silver candidate. They could not do Governor Matthews a greater dis service than to have it go out that the Indiana Democracy are for free silver. The adoption of a free silver plank in the State plitform would kill him; not merely embarrass or. injure him, but kill him. Politically speaking, the Gov ernor's fool friends might as well pre sent him with a loving cup of Rough on Rats as Identify the Democracy of his State with free silver. They should learn wisdom from the Governor him self. He discovered some time ago that the free silver gun was loaded, and he promptly laid It down. Ills fool friends should do the same if. they wish to avoid a fatal accident. A CIVll. 

PENSION 11 ST. In his report the Commissioner ot Pensions recommends that clerks in that bureau who have become unable to5 ren der any service through age should be pensioned. In an address before the Na tional Civil Service Association, Mr. Foulke' recommended that a fund be raised for the maintenance of super annuated -clerks and other -employes by' an assessment upon their salaries while they are able to do duty. If anything is to be done In the way of providing for clerks in the departments and pre venting their retention on the pay rolls when they are unable to render any service, Mr. Foulke's suggestion is the best that can be made. But why make these clerks special beneficiaries? They receive as much compensation, as a rule, as do men and women performing a service . requiring as much intelligence as one must possess to get a clerkship. For the work they actually . perform they receive higher compensation than clerks In private employment, yet there has hot as yet In this country been any proposition made to care for persons in private employment after they are un able to labor. Why discriminate? And Ithis leads to an inquiry as to the neces sity of retaining men and women In government clerkships until they be come old. Unless they become so ex pert as to be more useful than ordi nary clerks, would it not be better to limit their years of service to eight or twelve? In that time, if they are pru dent, they could find employment which would be better; for them than a life in the routine work of a department. An exception should.be made In favor of railway postal clerks, who cannot be said to be clerks in the ordinary sense of the word,' biit officials whose duties require efficiency and alertness. The higher skill and the risk which their work Involves should lead Congress to either increase their compensation or provide a fund for their support when they - are disabled. It requires three times as mucn capacity, If the phrase Is allowable, to make a competent postal clerk as to discharge the routine duties required of a $1,200 department clerk; yet, all things considered, the compen sation of the clerk is higher than that of the postal railway official. IIISTOHV REPEATING ITSELF. Hon." Galusha A. Grow, of Pennsyl vania, In his criticism of Mr. Cleveland's money borrowing, debt-making policy, said: "The present administration seems to have begun where the Buchanan ad ministration left off." The statement la historically true as well as neatly put. During 'the administration of Bu chanan, the last Democratic President before Cleveland, the public debt in creased from $31,972,000 In 1S36 to $64, 812,000 In 1860, and this In time of peace. During the last year of the administra tion money was borrowed at a ruinous rate of Interest to meet the necessary expenses of the government. On the 14th of December, 1S33, Congress passed a law authorizing the Issue of 110,000,000 In treasury notes, payable in one year, at the lowest rates offered. The Secre tary of the Treasury offered $3,000,000 of the notes, bids to be opened Dec 2S, and when the time came only $100,000 had been offered as low as 12 per cent. There were some offers at 24 per cent. and some as high as 26 per cent. The Secretary rejected all over 12 per cent. As the government needed money at once, it borrowed $1,500,000 of the banks at 12 per cenL A month later It offered $3,000,000 more of treasury notes, payable in one year, and they were taken at an average rate of 10 per cent. This shows the condition of the national finances In the last year of Buchanan's administration. Thanks to the Repub lican party, the public credit is a great .deal better now, but owing' to Demo cratic legislation the revenues of the government are not equal, to Its expendi tures, and the deficit has to be made up by borrowing money. Thus It may be fairly said that "the present adminis tration seems to have begun where the Buchanan administration left off." There was a sort of historic propriety In this statement coming from Mr. Grow. He was a member of Congress from 1S31 to 1S63, and personally cognizant of the disgraceful events during Buchanan's administration. Now, after more than thirty years, he is In Congress again and able to testify from personal knowledge that this administration seems to have begun where that of Buchanan left off. Mr. Grow is a very wid9-awake man, but If he had been asleep thirty odd years and had wakened up In the Treas ury Department he would be Justified in thinking that it was still the admin istration of James Buchanan. 

DEADLOCK OF THE STATE IIOAUD OF HEALTH. If the State Board of Health is of any practical use to the people of Indiana it should be efficiently organized. When the flr3t attempt was made last spring to elect a secretary qualified for the position, it is said that Dr. Ilurty would have been elected had not the Governor called In the two Democratic members of the board and insisted that they should vote for a Democrat. This state ment was made at the time, and it has never been' denied. As a result the matter has dragged along from March, and now there is no adequate organiza tion. The present secretary is said to be unfitted for the position. That the other four members of the board, two Republicans and two Democrats, do not vote for him indicates that they believe he is not the man for the position. So the usefulness of this board, if it has any, Is destroyed by continuing as its executive officer a man for, whom no member of it will vote, and who cannot be expected to do as well as he might under men who have expressed a lack of confidence In him. The deadlock arises over ihe question whether the secretary shall be a" Republican or a Democrat, not over the vastly more. im portant question of the man best quali fied for the position. Now, if this board is of any consequence whatever, its use fulness is being destroyed by this child ish contention as to whether the secre tary shall be a Republican or a Demo crat. He holds an office which cannot affect a public question upon which par ties divide. Consequently, if he Is a skillful and energetic man It matters not whether he Is a Republican or , Dem ocrat. An Inefficient Republican could be no more effective in efforts to check smallpox or other epidemics than an inefficient Democrat. It may be that the State Board of Health is not needed. The course pur sued by its members Is certainly cal culated to give that impression. The alleged action of the Governor in advis ing Democratic members of the board to refuse to vote for any man for secre tary, even so able a man as Dr. Hurty, indicates that he cannot lelieve that its mission is an important one. If he does, If such a board Is necessary In his Judg ment to look after the sanitary condi tions of the State, and he prevents its organization until a member of his staff can be elected secretary, he shows how Immeasurably more Important he re gards the appointment of a Democrat for a nonpartisan position than the efficient management of a board which deals with the public health. If this board cannot be organized at a very early day with an efficient secre tary, the Legislature should abolish it when it meets or so change the law creating it that its executive officer shall not continue to be a bone of contention between spoils mongers. The bill of Senator Davis, of Minne sota, does not establish the rank of lieutenant-general on the active list or add another officer to the list, but simply provides that the senior major general, while commanding the army, shall have the rank, pay and emoluments of a lieu tenant general. After the honor be stowed upon General Schofleld It should not be denied to such officers as Miles and Merritt. It would be much better for the Re publicans In the Senate to let the finance committee stand Instead of reorganizing It so that the free coinage Senators shall control It; but the Democratic pa pers have no chance to make objection so long as all of their members on that committee are in favor of free coinage. The County Commissioners have done the proper thing In the manner of their adver tising for bids for county printing In that they have reserved the right to reject any and all bids, in whole or in part. This will tend to prevent bidders from following the too prevalent custom of making low prices on the class of goods of vhich but little is bought, and making up the loss and a large profit by putting high prices on such items as are used in large quantities. The so-called "cute" bid .will not avail under such a rule. The State officers recently effected a large saving to the State by fol lowing this plan, but under the rule adopted by the commissioners they will be able to do relatively as well with much less labor in carrying out the figures. nunuLEs ix the air.

PERIODICALS. Among the features of Donahoe's Maga zine for December are Illustrated papers on the holy childhood In art, the mound-bulld-ers of America, dramatics In Catholic col lege3 and papal Avignon. Frank Leslie's Pleasant Hours for Boys and Girls Is a well illustrated and typo graphically attractive monthly containing a' good variety of stories and other juvenllb literature. The current Issue will commend itself to Boys particularly, because it tells them "how to win at football." The Christmas number of the Book Buyer (Scribner's) gives enticing glimpses into all the new books cf the season, being at one a guide to those undecided what to buy and a source of entertainment to the busy people who must content themselves with mere gllmpres Into current literature. The third quarterly issue of the Cyclo pedic Review of Current History (Buffalo) covers the events of the year from July 1 to Sept. SO. and is a most convenient book of reference. It comes in pamphlet form, and its matter is so carefully edited and condensed that It Is contained in ISO pages. The Monthly Illustrator Is filled with re productions of the work of well-known artists, with especial attention given to pictures relating to the Christmas season. It has a varied table of contents, the lit crary features rince the union of the maga zine with Home and Country having takeu a wider scope. The Strand Magazine is one of the cheaper English periodicals, each number being complete In itself and selling at 10 cents a copy. It is well printed and illusfated, and strictly English in -till its characteris tics. Like American magazines, however, it Is affected by the Napoleon craze, and in the current issue offers facsimiles of his signatures. Tho Christmas number of the Pali Mall Magazine numbers among its contributors Arthur Symons, Lord Ernst Hamilton, Grant Allen, Christian Burke, Sara Jean nette Duncan, the Duchess of Cleveland and I. Zangwlll. The pictorial features of this magazine are far superior to those of any other English periodical outside of the art publications. A variety of subjects which thinking people talk about are discussed In the De cember Eclectic Among them may be mentioned "The New Spirit , In History." "The Ethical Solution of One Social Prob lem." "Gaps in Agnostic Evolution," i.nd "Pasteur and His Work," the last named being the contribution of a biologist. From the Nineteenth Century is taken ?a Medi cal View of Miracles at Lourues." The Philistine discourses at some length on "The Charity that Paul Forgot." "He has given us," it says,' "the charity that suffers and is kind, that forgets self, that Is superior even to , martyrdom and the giving of all to the poor; and that is chief of all virtues, the very' spirit of goodness. But Paul of Damascus lived eighteen hun dred years ago. He knew all the kinds of charity that were In vogue In the first century. He did not know, or he forgot, organized charity." Rev. Edward Everett Hale says in Book News: "I would trust a boy in any gen tleman's library to choose for himself; ob serving that it must be a gentleman's IN brary, and not a blackguard's. If I were buying books for presents for him I would in all cases buy books of action, of ad venture, of natural science or of the open air. Boys have a strong sense of honor, but excepting that I do. not think they care about sentiment in. any of its forms. If they were introspective, as, thank God, they are not, I would never tempt them into the dangerous line of looking in rather than looking out." . .1, The Arena for December offers the first Installment of a series of recollections of America's "seven great poets." The con tributions come from'MInot J. Savage, John W. Chadwlck, F. B. Sanborn, Ed ward Everett Hale, Mary B. Clafiln and Henrietta S. Nahmer. They contribute recollections of Lowell, Emerson, Holmes, Whlttler and Bryant Chadwick and Sav age both writing on Emerson. The identity of Numbers C and 7, of the list of poets remains hidden. Among other contributions is one bv Henry GaullJeur. on .the wonders of hypnotism as recently-'demonstrated by leading French scientists. The Commercial Travelers Home Maga zine is a very well edited 'publication. Its contents are varied and are not confined to original contributions, selections, espe cially of verse, being included in the liter ary menu offered. One contribution of particular interest in the current issue is a study of wood and process engraving. The "Pingree potato patch" plan is de scribed In detail and its possibilities of ex tension set forth: The periodical professes to be "devoted to literature, trade, finance, manufacturing and transportation." and supports its claim admirably. It is pub lished at Binghamton, N. Y. Grover's Supreme Idea. Salisbury's letter may go to grass, Monroe may go to shucks; Doctrines come and doctrines pass. While I go hunting, ducks.

The President Criticised by Bankers for Ills Inuction. New York Letter in Philadelphia Press. Since Saturday many expressions of sur prise and anxiety have been heard from local bankers and financiers because of the delay in sending to Congress the re port of the Secretary of the Treasury. The surprise is occasioned because it has been presumed that Mr. Carlisle would in detail report upon those subjects which the President treated in a general way in his message. The anxiety Is due to the fear that Mr. Carlisle may have held back his report so long that he might elaborate certain recommendations not suggested by the President's message. "I am very anxious about Mr. Carlisle's report," said an ex-Controller of the Cur rency this morning. "If I could be sure that ho would go no further than the President did, then I should have no ap prehensions," and this comment suggests what many other bankers have been say ing. The wonder has been whether Mr. Car lisle would suggest,' as he ha3 before, that the law requiring national banks to keep a reserve be repealed. It has not escaped notice here that the President, while recom mending the cancellation of the legal tend ers. Bald nothing about the embarrass ment such action would cause the banks, unless some other provision was made for the reserve. That Mr. Cleveland did not mention this has caused the Impression to become general that he agrees with Mr. Carlisle and would favor the abolishment of the reserve feature of the national banking system. Aside from the fact that if the green backs were to be retired without also repealing the bank reserve law complica tions would arise, bankers speak of an other and greater objection. Not one of them with whom the Press correspondent has spoken has failed to express the opinion that to abolish the reserve would be a very dangerous step. Mr. Hepburn says that it should not be for an instant thought of, unless the banking laws are so changed as to permit the national banks to establish branches, as is done in Scot land. Another thing Is being more and more talked of here, and that Is the lnacuracy, not to say disingenuousness, of that part of the President's message which Intimates that the sale of bonds was not made neces sary In order to get funds to meit the treasury obligations. Every clearing house banker in this city remembers that in the first twelve months of Mr. Cleveland's administration $73.00.000 In gold was paid Into the New York clearing house by the subtreasury here because the government had nothing but gold with which to meat these obligations upon It. Chicago's Disappointment. Washington Special. With one accord tho Chicago crowd holds S. W. Allerton responsible for the lake city's falldown, but insiders do not believe Chicago would have secured the prize in any event. The game was set up against her from the start. Still, a scapegoat Is necessary, and Mr. Allerton has won that unhappy distinction. If he had joined the others of the delegation in pledging the hundred-thousand-dollar fund they think the committee would have named Chicago. He defen3ed himself on the ground that if he signed the pledge he would be put ting himself in the attltud of an indorser on $100,000 of unscrutlnliei papers, which was, to his shrewd and careful mind, a most unbuslness-llke proceeding. It was a risk he did not feel like assuming. This view was not wholly complimentary to the other gentlemen cf the delegation, but Mr. Allerton was a free agent and of legal age. When he quit the delegation had nothing to do but throw ujt Its hands and stand pat on a guarantee of some $50,000, which the richest man among them had stamped 'undoubtful."
