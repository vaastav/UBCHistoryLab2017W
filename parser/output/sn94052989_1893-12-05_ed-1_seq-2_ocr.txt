2 GROVER'S MESSAGE It Shows Weakness in Every Part. STANDS BY MR. BLOUNT, But Tells Congress Nothing New About Hawaii. FIRM ONLY ON TARIFF REFORM. The President Is Still Indiscreet With the Confidence of Mr. Wilson's Committee. Washington, Dec. 4.— The President's message to the Fifty-third Congress is, on the whole, rather a disappointing docu ment. Every stale question is touchpd, but not one is touched with that firm bold ness people had mther grown to expect irom Mr. Cleveland. With regard to those features of public policy In which Cali fornia Is most interested it is said, in effect, that tbe Gearv law was nullified because Chinamen opposed It, and noth ing not already known is told about tbe Hawaiian muddle. Tbe President seems to have cultivated a doubt, after all, as to the benefits to flow fmm tbe repeal of the silver-purchasing clauso of the Sher man act, and while the passage of tbe Wilson tariff bill is urged the message is at least indiscreet in api roving the adoption ! of the plan for an income tux before that plan, so far at least as the Committee of Ways and Means as a whole knows, h.»s been adopted at all. The text of the mes- | 6aße is as follows: To the Congrrsg of the United States: The constitutional duty which requires the Presi . dent from time to time to . give to the Congress information of the state of the Union and ieci>rn mrud to their consideration such measures as lie 8h II judire uecessaiy, is fittingly entered upon by commending to the Congress a careful recommendation of the devilled statements and well purported recommendations contained In the report* of the depaitmeuts that are chiefly dialled with the executive work of the Govern ment. In an elTort to abridge this communica tion as much as is consistent, with Its pui pose I snail supplement a brief reference to the con teuts of the departmental reports by the men tion of such executive business and incident as are not embraced therein, and by such recom mendations as appear to be at this particular time appropriate!. While our loreigi) lelations have not all times during the past year been entirely free from perplexities no embarrassing situations remain that will not yield to that spirit of fairness and love of ]u»tic which, joined with consistent firmness, characterize the true American for eign policy. My predecessor having accepted the office of arbitrator of a long-standing missions boundary dispute, tendeiea to the President by the Argentine Kepublic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty 10 receive the special envoys missioned by these States to lay before me evidence ana arguments in behalf of their re spective Governments. The outbreak of domestic hostilities In the republic of Brazil found the Untied States alert to watch the interests of our citizens in that country, with which we carry on Important commerce. Seveial vessels of our new navy are now and for some time have bern stationed at liio de Janeiro. The struggle being between the established Government, which controls the machinery of the administration, and with which we maintain friendly relations and cer tain officers of the navy employing the vessels of their command in an attack upon the na tional capital aud chief sea port, and lacking as It does the elements of decided administration, I have failed to see that the gents can reasonably claim recognition as belligerent" Thus the position of our Government has been that of an aueutive but impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict. ; Empnaslzlug our fixed-policy of Impartial neutrality in such a condition of giairs as now exist*, l deemed It necessary to disavow In a manuer not to be misunderstood Hie unauthorized action of the late naval commander in these waters In saluting the revolted Brazilian admiral, being j Indisposed to countenance an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to the local lusur rection. The convention between our Government I and Chile, having for its object the settlement ! and adjustment of the demands of the two I countries against each other, has been made I eflectlve by the organization of the Claims Commission provided for. The two Govern ments failing to agiee upon the third member of the commission, the good offices of the President of the Swiss republic were Invoked. I . as provided in in- treaty, aud the selection of I ■ the Swiss representative lv i lie country to complete the organization was gratifying to the United states and to Chile. The vexatious question of so-called legation asylum for offenders against the Slate and Its laws was preseuted anew in Chile- by : 'he un authorized action of the late United States Minister k\ receiving at his official residence two | persons who had failed In an attempt at revo imion, and against whom criminal charges I ■were i ending growing out of a former abortive disturbance. The doctilne of a«ylura as ap plied to this case is not sanctioned by the best precedent, and when allowed tends to encour age sedition and strife. Under no circum stances can the representatives of this Gov m- j ment be permitted under th - 111-defined fiction of extra-ten itonality to interrupt the adminis tration of criminal justice in the countries to which they are accredited. A temperate de mand having been made by the Chilean Gov ernment tot tire correction of this conduct id the instance mentioned the Minister was in- ! structed no longei to harbor the offenders. 

OPPOSED BY CHINESE. The legislation or last year, known as the ! Geary law, requiring the registration ot all Chinese laborers entitled to residence In the United States 'and the deportation of all not | complying with the provisions of the act within j the time prescribed, met with much opposition from Chinamen in this country. Acting upon j the advice of eminent counsel that the law was I unconstitutional, the great mass of Chinese ! laborers, pendldg judicial inquiry as to its i validity, in good faith declined to apply for their certificates required by Us provisions. A test upon proceedings by habeas cor pus was I brought before the .-supreme Court, and on May j 15, 1893, a decision was made by that tribunal sustaining the law. It is believed that under the recent amend ment ot the act extending the time for regis tration, the Chinese laborers thereto entitled ' who deslie to reside in thl* country will now ! avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus i afforded of establishing by lawful procedure I their right to remain, «ud ihat thereby the ne- i cessity ■•£ enforced deportation may to a great I degree be avilded. It has devolved upon the United States Mia- I ister at I. knit;, a- deaD or the diplomatic body and In the absence of a representative of Swe den and way, to press upon the Chinese Government, reparation for the iec nt murder of Swedish missionaries at Sunn Pu. This question is of vital luierest 10 all countries whose citizens are engaged In missionary work lv the in.eiior of China. , *'?.vW FOREIGN RELATIONS. By article XII of the general act of the Brus- I sels confer ence, signed July 2, 1800, for the j suppression of the slave trade and the restric tion of certain injuries to commerce in the In- j dependent States of the Congo and the adjacent State of central Africa the United States and other signatory powers agreed to ; adopt appro- ! priate means for the punishment of persons I selling arms and ammunition to the natives I and for the confiscation of inhibited articles, It I being the plain duty of this Government to aid In suppressing the nefarious traffic, impairing I as it does the praiseworthy and civilizing efforts = now going forward In thai region. . I recom mend thai an act be passed prohibiting the sale of arms and Intoxicants to natives in the regu- ; laied zone by our citizens. ' Costa Kica has lately testified Us friendliness by surrendering to the United States, In the ab sence or a convention of extradition, but upon duly submitted evidence of criminality, a noted fugitive trom justice. It is uusied> mat the negotiation of a treaty with that couutry, to I meet lecurrlng cases of this kind, will soon be I accomplished. In my opinion treaties for reel procal relations should be concluded with all I those countries with wiilcb the United States ' bas not already conventional arrangements ot that character. I have not uer-med it fitting to ' express to me Government of Costarica and ; Colombia the kindly desire of the United Stales i to see their tending boundary dispute finally i clo-t-d; by arbitration In conformity with the spirit of the treaty concluded between them some years aco. t Our relations with the French republic con ttoue to be intimate ana cordial. 1 sincerely hope that the extradition tieaty with that coun try, as amended i>v the Seuate. will be opera tive. While occasional questions affecting our naiuralized citizens returning to the land <>f tiieir biith h v- aiiien in our intercourse with Get many, our I'latious with Ibat couutry con tinue salisfncrory. The questions affecting our relations with Great mitaln have h en treated Id a spirit of Mendliness, Negotiations are In progress be t w en the two Governments with a vlrw to such concurrent action as will make tbe award aod regulations agreed upon by the Bering Sea tribunal of a- Duration practically etl-ctive, and it is noi doubled tha 1 Great Bit, am will co operate freely with thi* counuy for the accom plishment of that puipuse. The dispute growing out of the discriminating n.ll lmiosed In the Uelland canal upon cai goes of cwieals bound to aud from me lake ports of the United Slates was anjust d by the substitution of a moie equitable -ched uie of charges, and my piedeces-or thereupon suspended his proclamation Imposing disci lini- Dating (oils upou British cargoes id liansil through our canal. A leque-t for additions to the list of exiiaditable ollenses covered by the txisiing tteaty between the two countries Is under consideration. During the |>a*t year an Am -Mean citizen employed Id a subordinate commercial position In liayti, after suffering protracted Imprison ment od an unfounded cbaigeof sniiitrviing, was finally liberated on a Justice's examina tion. . . ; ;.; •-., :,- •._; ; Upon urgent representation to the Haytlan Government suitable Indemnity was laid to the sufferer. By a law of Uaytl a sailing ve-sel having discharged tier cargo Is refused clear ance until the duties on sue)) cargo have been paid. The hardship of this measure upon American ship-owners, who conduct the bulk of the carrying trade of that country, bus been call' d to tlif attention of the Huytiau Govern meDt with a view of securing a removal of ibis cause of complaint. Upon receiving authentic Information of the firiug upon . >n American mall steamer touch ing at the port of Aniapala because her captain refused to deliver up a passenger In transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala upon aemaud of the military authoittles of Honduras, our Min ister to that country under instructions pro tected against the wan on act and demanded satisfaction. The Government of Honduras, actuated by a sense of Justice and in a npirlt of tile utmost friendship, promptly disavowed the illegal .conduct of Its officers, and expressed sincere regietfor the occurrence. It is conn d silly anticipated that a satisfactory adjust ment will soon be reached of the questions arising oik of the seizure and use of American ! vessels by Insurgents in Honduras, and the | subsequent deui 1 by the successful Govern j ment of commercial privileges to these vessels ; on that account. i A notable part of the southeasterly coast of ; Liberia, between the Cavally and San I'edio j rivers, which lor neatly half a century has : been g. uerally recognized as belonging to that republic by accession and purchase, li.is been i claimed to be under the proieciorate of France ! lv virtue of aereemenis entered Into by the ua- I live tribes over whom Liberia's control has not j been well niaiutani' d. aMoie recently negotia i tions between the Llberlau representative and I the French Government resulted in the signa • tuie at Paris of a neaty wheieby as au adjust ; ment ceitain Ltberiau territory Is ceded to I France. This convention at last advices had ! not been ratified by the Llberian Legislature j and Executive. Feeling a sympathetic interest iv the fortune of the little commonwealth, the establishing nt and development of which weie largely aided by the Deuevoleoce of our coun trymen, and which constitutes the only lode, --j pendent sovereign Mate on the west coast of ; Africa, thU Government has suggested to the | trench Government Us earnest concern lest I territorial Impaiunent in Liberia hi mild take 1 place without her unconstiained consent. Our relations with Mexico continue to be of that close and friendly nature winch bbould always characterize the intercourse of two neighboring republics; -A'- The work of relocating i tie monuments mark ing the bouudaiy .between the countries from Paso del None to the I'aciDc is now nearly completed.

NICARAGUA CANAL. . Nicaragua has recently passed through two revolutions, the party at flist successful having In turn been displaced by another. Our newly appointed Minister, by bis timely good efforts, aide! in a peaceful adjustment of the contro versy Involved lv tbe first conflict. The large American Interests established in that country ( in connection with tbe Nicaragua canal were i not molested. Tbe canal company has, unfortunately, be came financially s riously embarrassed, but a generous treatment has be< v exteudt-d to it by the Government of Nicaragua. Tbe United States is especially Interested In ttie success ful achievement of the vast undertaking this company has id charge. Inat it should be ac complished under distinctively Amei lean au»- I Ices and Us enjoyment assured not only to the vessels of mis couutiy as a cliHDuel of commer cial coniiiuiQiciiioti between our Atiamic and Pacific seaboards but to tb- ships of tv ■ world In tbe Inteiests of civilization, Is a proposition which in my judgment does not admit of ques tion. Guatemala has also been visited by the pollti c I vicissitudes wliich have afflicted her Central American neighbors, but the dissolution of its Lemsiature and the proclamation of dictator ship have been unattend d by civil war. An extradition treaty wliu Norway has re cently been exchaue-d and proclaimed. The extradltlou treaty wiib liussla, signed in Match. 1887, and amended and confirmed by the Sen ate in February last, was duly proclaimed last June. AFFAIRS IN SAMOA. Led by a desire to compose differences and contribute to tbe restoration of order in Samoa, which for some years previous had been the scene of conflicting for-ieu pretensions and native si rife, the United States, departing from Us policy consecrated by a century of observ ance, entered four years ago into the treaty of Berlin, thus becoming jointly bound with Eug laud and Germany to establish aud maintain Malietoa Laupep.t as King of Samoa. To- treaty provides for a foreign court of justice, & municipal council for tbe dis trict of Apia, witb a foreign pre.iideu thereof authorized to advise the Klni;, a tribunal for the settlement of native and foreign land titles, and a revenue system for ihe. kingdom. I entailed upon the ttnee power* ihe payment of that part of tu cust of the new government not met by the tvenue of the Isluuus. Early in tbe life or tiils triple proiecioiate the uailve"dissensions it was designed to quell revived, and th- rebels defied Hie authori y of the new King, refusing to pay Use* aud Uemauuiuu the election of a ruler by native sufftage. vataafa an aspirant to the I throne, and a larce number of his native ad i lieieuts weie in open rebellion on one of I the isiand<. Quite lately, at the re- I guest of the other powers, and In fulfillment I ot Its treaty obligation, this Government agreed I io unite io a joint military movement of such dimension* as would probably «ecure the stir j render or the insurgents without bloodshed. I The warship Philadelphia was accordingly nui under orders foi Samoa, but before she at lived the tbr<-ateued conflict was precipitated by King Malletoa's a tack upon the insurgent camp Mataafa wns d-feaied and a number of men Killed. The British and German vt»s*els Dieseu; subsequently secured the surrenoer of M taafa and bis adherents. The defeated chief and ten of his principal supporters were de ! ported to a German island of the Marshal I group, where they re held as prisoners uuder the Joint responsibility and cost of the three ' powers. This Incident and ihe events leading up to It siuualiy illustrate the Impolicy of entangling alliances with foielgu powers, VARIOUS ENTANGLEMENTS. More than fifteen years ago this Government preferred a claim against Spain In behalf of one of our citizens for property celled and confis cated In Cuba. In 188 C the claim wa« adjusted. Spalu agreeing to : pay unconditionally as a fair Indemnity $1,500,000. A ■ respectful -" but earnest 'note was recently addressed to the Spanish Government Insisting upon tne prompt fulfillment of its long ueulected obligation. , Other claims preferred by the United States against Spain In behalf of American citizens for property confiscated In Cuba have been pending for ninny yearn. At the time Spain's title to the Caroline Islands. was confirmed by aibi ration that Government agreed that the rights which hive been acquired bee by American missionaries should be recognized and resp' cted. It Is since nly hoped that this plan will be obseived by allowing our mission aries, who were removed from I'onape to a place of safety by a United State* warship duuug tbe trouble between the Spanish garrison and tbe natives, to leium to tcelr field of usefulness. The teproduced caravel Santa Maria, built by Spain and sent to the Columbian Exposition has been preened to the United States la token of amity; and In commemoration of the event it was design ted to celebrate. I recom mend that in accepting thit gift Congress make graieful recognition of the sincere Irundsulp which prompt- d it. . v ■• - .. .., / ■■,;, ■ Impoilaui matters have demanded attention In our r. -latlon- with th Ottoman Porte. The tiring and pa rtlal destruction by an unre strained mob of one of the school buildings of Anaioly College, established by citizens of the United Stales at Marsovan,, and the apparent indifference of the 'Turkisn 'Government to iho outrage, notwithstanding the complicity of some of Its i>Hlcia!s, called for earnest remon stration, which was followed by promises of reparation' and punishment of the offenders.

The ratifica tion by Venezuela of lbe couveutiau for the flrimia ton of the loug-defened claim of Ui Veui zulau Tiausportatiou Company is awaited. THE HAWAIIAN MUDDLE. It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arlstDg from our relations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment. Just prior to the iustallatiou of the present ad ministration the existing Government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown aud a reaty of auut-xation had beeu negotiated between the Provisional Government of the Islands and the United Slates and submitted to tbe Sen ate for ratification. This treaty I wiih ciiew for examination and dispatched Hon. James U. Blount of Geoigla to Hono lulu as a sjeci.it commissioner to make an Impartial lnvt Mlgailou of the circumstances aileudlog tbe change ot Government and of all the conditions b arinn upon the subject of the iie.uy. Alter a thoiouKti aud exhaustive ex amination Mr. Blount submitted to me his re port, showing beyond all question that tbe Constitutional Government of Hawaii bad been subvnied with the ac ive aid of our represen tative to that Government, and through the lu timiJation caused by tbe presence of an armed naval force of tbe United Stales, wbicb was Inuded for '.hat purpose at the Instance of our Minister. Upon the facts developed It seemed to me that the only honorable course for our (.ovei niiieni to puisu- was to undo the wruug th.it had beeu done by thos ieprese.hllug us aod to restore as far as practicable tbe simus existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accomplishing tnis result within tbe constitutional limits of the executive power, and recoguizmg all our obligations and respou- Btbilitiea erowini; out of any changed conditions trout hi about by our unjustifiable luteifereuca our present Minister at Honolulu has received appropriate Instructions to mat end. Tluu far no lnfoi mutton of the accomplishment of any detinue tesulis has beeu received from him. Additional advices are. soou expected, and wh v r celved they will be promptly s>-ul to Cougiess together with all other Infoima- I tl'Mi at liana and accompanied by a si«cul ; executive messaice holy detailing tbn arts : necessary to a comi let* undei standing of the ! case and piesentmt; a history of all the ma terial events leading up to tbe present situ- I atlou. 

INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION. By a concurrent resolution passed by the Senate on Frbiuary 14, 1890. and by tbe House of Repie*entatives on tbe 3d of April following, tbe Pre»ld-nt was requested to in vite iiom lluie to time, as tit occasion may arise, neyoi ihtUMis wltn any Government with which the l.'ut ed St tes has or may have diplomatic reiatious, to the end that any ulHtrence or dis pute arising between tbe two Governnieuts winch cannot be adjusted by diplomatic agency may be referred to arbitration and be peaceably adjusted by such mean*. On April 15, 1890. i lie International! American conference of Washington, by resolution, expiesseil the wish that all controversies between the republics of Ameilc .-. and the nations or Europe might be settled by arbitration, and recommended that tue Government of each ua iion represented in that couleience should communicate this wish to all filetidly powers. A favorable response has been received from Great Britain Id mo shape of a resolution adopted by Parliament on July 15 last cordial ly sympathizing with the purpose In view and expressing Hie nope ibai tier Majesty's Govern ment will lend ie*dy co-operation to I lie Gov ernment of the United Slates upon the basis of the concurrent resolution above quoted. It affords unfeigned Dleasuie to lay mis Par llameulary resolution before Cougiets, and to express my gratification that tbe sentiment of two gr- at and kindred nations Is thus authori tatively manifested in favor of me rational ana peaceable settlement of international quarrels by an honorable lesort to arbitration. Since the passage of the act of March 3, 1893, authorizing me President to raise the grnde of our Envoys to correspond with the rank In which foreign countries acciedlt their agents here, Great Britain, France, I aly and Germany have conferred upon their represen tative?! at tills capital the title of Embas«ador and I have responded accrediting the agents of the United 6'ates In those countries with the -aine title. A like elevation of mission Is announced by Russia and when made will be similarly met. I his step fittingly emm orts with Hip position the United Stales holds In the fatuity of nations. During my foimer administration I took oc casion to recommend a recast of the laws re lating to th consular service. In order that it mleht become a more efficient agency in the promotion of the Interests it was lut< nd-d to mibseive. The duties and powers of consuls have been expanded with the growing lequtre incut < of our foreign trade. Discharglug Im portant duties aßectlng our commerce and Ameiican citizens abroad, and In certain coun tries exercising judicial functions, these officers should be nun of character, intelligence aud ability. Upon proof that the legislation of Denmark secures copyright to Ameiican citizens on an equal footing with its own, the pi ivileges of our copyright law have been extended by procla mation to subjects of that couuiiy. • ■/ 

MATTERS OF FINANCE. The Secret of the Treasury reports thai the receipts of the Government from nil sources during the fiscal year end- d June 30, 1893, amounted to 718,561 94, and Its expendi tures to $459,574,674 39. There was collected from customs $206,355,016 75, md from in ternal revenues $161,027,623 93. Our duti able Imports amounted to $4:21.856,711, an Increase of $52,453,907 over the preceding year, and on lmpoitatlous, free of duty, amount ed to $444,544,211, a decrease from the pre ceding year of $18,455,467.

It 1- estimated upon the baMs of the present revenue laws that the receipts of the Govern ment for the year ending June 30. 1893, will be $430,121,365 38, and Us expenditures $458, --121.305 38. resulting In a deficiency of $28. --000.000. On the Hist day of November, 1893 the amount of money of all kinds In circulation, or.- not included in treasury holdings, was 51. 7 18.544.682, an Increase for lie year of $112,404,947. Ksimiaiitiß our population at 67,426,000 at the time mentioned, the < per capita circulation wan, s2s 49. On (he same date there was in the treasury gold bullion amounting to $96,057,272. and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost or $126,261 653. Our total coinage of all metals durlntt (he last fiscal ye r ron»lsi»-d of 97.280 875 pieces, val ued iit $43,686,188 80 of winch there was $30,036,140 In gold coin. $5,343,715 In sllvei dollars, $7,217,220 90 In subsidiary silver coiu and $1,086,102 90 in minor coin*. During the calendar year 18i»2 the produc tion of precious metals in Hie United stales was estim.iled to. be 1,593,375 tine ounces of cold, of Him commercial and coinage value of $33,000,000, and 58,000.000 -flue ounces' of silver, of the bullion or in.uket value $50 - 750,000, and of the coinage v.i ue of $74. --989,900. ■-.-■ • ' The chases of silver under the law of July 14, 1890, dvi lug the last fiscal year aggregated 64.008.162.59 tin- ounces, which cost $45 - 531,374 63. The total amount of sliver pur chased from tee time ; that law became opera tive until me repeal ol Us purchasing clause on : th- last day of & O v tuber, 1893, was 163.679. --590.46 fine ouue •«, which cost $155,930, --940 84. Between the first day of March, 1873. and the first day of November, 1893. the Gov ernment purchased under ail law* 503 003.717 fine ounces of silver at a cost of $510,622,948. The silver dollars mat have been coined under the act of July 14. 1890, number 36.087.285. The seigniorage arising fiom such coinage was $6,977,098 39. leaving on baud in the minis 140,099,700 flue ounces of silver, which cost $120,578,218. It Is estimated that on the first day of July, 1893, the metallic stock of money in the Untied States, consisting of coin and bullion, anmuuied to $1,213,559,109, of which §597,897,085 was gold and $015,801,484 was silver. One hundied aud {lineteeu national banks weie organized during the year ending October 21.1893. with a capital of $11,230,000, 46 went Into voluntary liquidation an.i 158 sus pended. Sixty-five of the suspended backs were insolvent. 86 resumed business aud 7 re mained In the hands of bank examiners \\i,h prospects of speedy resuniptlou. Of the new banks organized 44 were located In me Eastern Mates. 41 west of the Missouri liiver and 34 In the Central and Sou hem States. The total number of national banks in existence on the 31st day of Octob-r. 1893. was 3796. having an aggregate capital of $695,558,120. The net increase In the circu lation of these banks during the year was 130,880,972. The recent repeal of the provlstou of the law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the Government as a feature of our monetary scheme made an entiic change in the complex ton of our currency affairs. Ido not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary aud far-reaching. in i he nature of thing*, however, It is Im possible to know at this time precisely what conditions will be brought about by the change, or what, if any, supplementary legislation may In the light of such conditions appear to be es sential or expedient. Or course, after there cent financial perturbation, lime Is necessary for i be re-establishment of business confidence, when, however, tb.oiiuh this restored coufi deuce the money which has been f tightened Into hoarding places Is returned to trade and enterprise, asuiv y of the xituullon will proba bly disclose a safe path leading to a permanently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our Incicaslng population and business. In the pursuit of ibis object we should resolutely turn awayfioui ailuriug and temporary expedients, determlui a to be content with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan, In these circumstances 1 am convinced thai a reasonable delay in dealing with this subject instead of being injurious will Increase the probability of wise action. Ihe monetary conference, which assembled at Brussels upon our tnvitailon, was adjourned to me 30tti day of November In the present year. Tbe consideration just stated and the fact that a definite proposition from us seemed to be expected upon the reassembling of the conlerence, I'd me to express a willingness to have the meeting further postponed. It seems to me that it would be wise to give general authority to tbe President to invite other na tions to such a couference at any time when there should be a fair prospect of accomplishing an liiteruaiioual agreement on the subject of coinage. I do>ire also to earnestly suggest tbe wisdom of amending the existing statutes In regaid to the Issuance of Government bonds. The au thoiity now vested lv the Secretary of the Treasury to Issue bonds Is not as clear as It should be, and the bonds authorized are dis advantageous to the Government, both as to the time of tbeir maturity aud me rate of in terest.

IMMIGRATION AND QUARANTINE. Tbe Superintendent of Immigration, through the Secretary of the Treasury, reports that during the last fiscal year mere arrived at our ports 440,790 immigrants. Of ibese 1063 were not permitted to laud under the limitations of the law, and 577 were returned to the coun tries from whence they came by reason of their having become public charges. The total ar rivals were 140,034 less than for the previous year. The Secretary in his report gives an account of in* operation of 1 1 i■ - marine hospital si vice and of the good work done under us super vision In preventing the introduction and spread of contagious diseases. The admoni tions of the last two years touching our public health aud the demonstrated danger of the in troduction of contagious diseases from foreign ports has Invested the subject of national quar antine w#th Increased inte est. A more gen eral and harmonious system thai now exists, acting promptly aud directly eveiy where and constantly operating by pieventlng. meant to Bhield our country from the invasion of disease aud at the same ilme b • ving due regard to tbe rights and duties of local agencies would, 1 believe, add greatly to the safety of our people. CONCERNING THE ARMY. The Secretary of _ War reports that the strength of the army on the 30ih day of Sep tember last was 25,7 78 enlisted men aud 2144 officers. The total expenses of this department for the year ending June 30, 1893, amounted to $51,960,074 99. Or Ibis sum $1,992,501 95 was for salaries and contingent Expenses, $23,377,828 35 for ibe support of the military establishment, $0,077,033 28 for miscellaneous \ objects and $20,158,631 41 for public works. This latter sum Includes $15,296,576 46 for river and harbor Improvements and $3,260, --141 28 for fortifications and other works of defense. The total enrollment of the militia of the several States was, on the 31st of October of the current year, 112,597 officers and enlisted men. The officers of the army detailed for the Inspection and instruction of this reserve of our military rorce report that Increased Interest and marked progiess are apparent in the disci pline and efficiency of the organization. Neither Indian outbreaks nor domestic vio lence has call d the at my into service during the year, and the only active military duty required of it has been in the Department of Texas, wh ie violations of the neutrality laws of the United Stales aud Mexico were promptly and efficiently dealt with by the troops, ellcit iufE the warm approval of lie civil and military authorities of both countries. Tb« fact that civilization Is constantly tend- Ing to relieve the country from the danger of Indian hostilities, together with the Increasing ability of the Sate* thtouuh the efficiency of the National Guard organlztlons to protect their citizens from domestic violence, lead to the nnHtlM that the time is fast approach- Ing when there should be a reorganization of our at my on the lines of Ihe pi c.sent necessi ties of ihe country. Tim change contemplate s no Increase in numb r nor added ex pense, but a redistribution of the force and an encouragement of mea«uies tend ing to eater efficiency among the men and to the improvement of the service. The adoption of battalion formations for In fantry 1 1- ._ i tii.-ii ; -. the slreng'henlng of the artillery foice, the abandonment of frontiei posts ami the massing of the Hoops at Itn ioi t nt aud accessibl stations allptomiseto ii mole the usefulness of the army.- In the judgment of army officers, wl:li bu 1 few excep tions, the operation of the law lot bidding the ie-enllstmetilof men after ten years' seivice has not pi oven Its wisdom, and while the argu ments which led to its adoption were not with out met It the experience of the year constrains me to join In the recommendation tor Its repeal. . It Is gratifying to note th.a we have begun to attain completed results In the comprehensive scheme of searoast defense and fortifications entered upon eight years ago. A large sum bas b-eu already expended, but the cost of main taining the forts will be lucon*lderable as com pared with the cxi ense of construction and ord nance. At the end of the current cat ndjsr year the War Depaitment will have nine 12 --inch euii", twenty 10-Inch aud thirty-tour 8-inch gun* ready to be mounted on gun lifts and carriage*, and seventy-live 12-inch mor tais. In addition to ihe product of ihe army l'Uii factoiy, now completed at Watervliet, the Government has contracted with pilvate par tie" for the purchase of 100 guns of th ->c 9 ill. bets, the first of which should be delivered to the department . for test, before July 1, 1894. The niitnuractuieof heavy otdnance keens pace with cm tent needs but to lender these gnus available for the purposes they ate deslgueu to meet emplacements must be pie. ared for them.

OLNEY'S REPORT. 1 lie report of IIH Aitoruey-General contains the usual summary of i lie affairs and proceed ings of the Department of Justice for the past year, together with certain recommendations as to needed legislation on various subjects. 1 cm not too heartily indorse the proposition that the fee system as applicable to the compensa; tlon of United States attorneys, marshals', clerks officials or courts and United Slates Commissioners, should b' abolished with as little delay as possible. It Is clearly in the in terest of the community that the busi ness of the courts, both civil ana crimi nal, shall be as small and as Inexpensively trausactedjas (be ends of Justice will allow. That svstern, th-refore. Is thoroughly vicious which mattes th- compensation of court offi cials depend upon the volume of such business, and inns creates a conflict between a proper execution of the law and private gain which cniiuot fail lobe dangerous to (he rights and freedom of the citizen- and forms an irresisti ble temptation to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. If Ib addition to tins reform another was Inaugurated which would give to United States Commissioner', the final disposi tion of petty offenses wlihln tl)>- grade of misde meanors, and . especially those coming under the internal revenue laws, a great ailvtnce would be made toward a more decent aumiuls tration of the criminal law. In my first message to Congress, dated De cember 8, 1885, 1 strongly recommended these changes, and referred somewhat at length to the evils of the ice system. Since that lime the criminal business ol the Fedeial courts and the expense att uding it have enormously in ciea*ed. The number of criminal prosecutions pending in the Circuit and District courts of the United States on the 1-t day of .inly, 1835, was 3808, of which 1884 were for violations of the Internal revenue laws, while the number of such prosecutions pending on the Ist day of July, 1883, was 4200. all of which were for violation of the Internal revenue laws. The expenses of the Unit, d States courts, exclusive of Judges' salaries, and for 'he year ending July 1, 1885, weie 2, 874.753 11. and for the year ending July 1, 1893, $4,528,056 87. It Is therefore apparent that the reason* given Id 1885 for a change in the manner of enforcing the Federal criminal law have galued cogency and strength by the lapse of time. 1 also heartily join the Attorney-Gene in recommending legl-ln ion fixing the degrees of the crime of minder within the Federal juris diction, .is has been done in many of the State, authorizing writs of error on behalf of the Gov ernment In cases where final judgment Is ren dered against i he «ufflcieucy of an indictment or against the Government upon any other quest iou rising before actual trial, limiting the right of review in cases of felony punishable only by fine and Imprisonment to the Circuit Court of Appeals and making speedy provision for the construction of such prisons and refor matories as may be necessary for tbe confine ment of United States convicts. ABOUT THE MAILS. The report of the Postmaster-General con talus a detailed statement of the operations of the Postofflce Department during the last Use ll year and much interesting information touch ing this Important branch of the public service. Tbe business of the malls indicates with abso lute certainty the condition of the business of the country, and depression in financial affairs Inevitably and quickly reduces the postal reve nues. Therefore, a larger discrepancy than usual between the Postoflice receipts and ex penditures is the expected and unavoidable result of the dlstiesslng stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the time cove. ed by the Postmaster-General's report. . At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessor Mia the deficiency on the 30th day of June. 1893, would be but a little over $1,500,000. It amounted, however, to nioie than $5,000,000. At the came time, ana under (tie influence of like an ticipation, estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, which ex hibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of £872,245 71; but now. in view of the actual receipts and expenditures during that part of the current li-c.ii year already expired, the Postmaster-General estltmtes that at its close instead of a surplus there will be a deficiency of nearly $8,000,000. The postofUce receipts for the last fiscal year amount' d to 176,896,933 15, and Its ex penditures $81,074,104 90. This postodice deficiency would disappear or be immensely decreased if less matter was carried free through the malls, an Item of which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and grain from the Agri cultural Department. . The total number of postofflces In the United States on the 30tb day of June. 1893. was 403, an increase of 1284 over the preceding year. Of these 3360 weie Presidential offices, an Inciease In tbat class of 204 over the pre ceding year. Forty-two free delivery offices were added duilug the year to those alieaoy existing, mak ing a total of 610 cities and towns provided with fr c delivery on June 30, 1893. Nine y lluee other cities and towns are now entitled to this mm vice under the law, but It has not been accorded th m on account of Insufficient funds to meet the expense of its establishment. 1 am decidedly of the opinion that the pro visions of ; lie present law permit as general an introduction of this feature of mail service as is necessary o justifiable, and that it ought not to be extended to smaller communities, than those now designated. The expense of free delivery for the fiscal year eliding June 30, 1893, will be more than 11.000.000 and uud- i the legislation existing there must be a constant increase In this Item of expenditure*. There were 6101 additions to the domestic money-oider offices during the last fiscal year, being the largest Increase Id any year since the inauguration of the system. The total number of these offices at the close of me year was 18,434. There were 13.309,735 money orders Issued from these offices, being an increase over the preceding year of 1.246,290. and the value of these orders amounted to $127,576, --433 05. an increase of 7,509.632 58. 1 here were also Issued during ihe year postal notes amounting to $13.908 73. Dui lug .the year 195 lute rnatlonal money order offices were addeJ to those already pro vided, ma • itiLr ■ total of 2407 In operation on June 30, 1893. The number of International iiiouev orders Issued duiing the year was 1,055,959. an Increase over the preceding year of 72,525, and then value was 10.341,837 86, - n inciea«e of $1,222,506 31. The v umber of order* paid was ;;»'■ ,vu . an iuctease over the preceding year of 13,503, .aid theli value was ¥5,283,375 70, au Increase of $94,094 83. Fi I'll, i lie forepoiiiE statement it appears that the total issue of money orders and postal notes lor the year amounted 82 1.348 24. - The number of letieisand packages mailed dm ing the year lor special delivery was 3,375, --(303.au Increase over the preceding year of neatly 22 per cent. The special delivery stamps used upon these letters and package* amounted to $337,559 30 and the messengers fees l Ma for tapir delivery amounted to $266, --692 71, leaving a profit to the Government of 880.976 59. » . . Ihe railway mail service not only adds to the promptness of mall delivery at all offices, bu it is the especial Instrumentality wlricn puts Hie smaller and way places iv the service on au equality in that regard with the larger and terminal offices. » . ■ This branch of the postal service has, there* fore, received mote attention, from the I . • -> t master-Geueral, and though .It is sratiivtng to know that It Is in a condition of high efficiency and great usefulness I am led toauieewtu the Postmaster-General that there is room for Its luithci improvement. There are now connected with the postofflce establishment 28.324 employes' who are In the classified service.

ECONOMY IN THE NAVY. The report of the Secretary of ill? Navy con tains a history of the opeiatlons of ; Ins depart nit ut during Hie past year a. d exhibits a most gratifying condition of tbe personuel of our navy. lie presents a satisfactory* account of the progress which has been made In tbe cou siructlon of vessels, and m.ik a number of recommendations to which aiteutiou Is es pecially luvited. ;;•;'-.■-: : During the past six months tbe demands- for cruising vessels have been many and frequent. There have been revolution* calling for v. ssels to protect ;Aniei lean luleiests In Is'icaiagua, Guatemala, co>ta Klca, Honduras, mine ami Brazil, while the condition of *rt.iii->m liouolulu has tequlied the constant presence Hieie of ; ouc 01 mure »blps. ; With ail these calls upou our navy It became neces.saiy In oider to make up a sutllclent Heel to patrol ihe Bering >f.i under ihe niudus vlveuut agreed upon wliiiGieat Britain to detail to tbat ser vice one vensel from the Fish Commlsslou aud lhie« tiom the i evenue marine. I'ioities* in the cousuuctlon of now vessels ha* uot beeu as lupld as was anticipated. id ere have been delays In the completion of unaimoied vessels ; ■ but for ; the '• most part they have been such as arc constantly occur ■ rluic, eveu In ; countries having the larcesi ex peileuce tv naval vliip-buildiiiß. The most serious delays, however, have been In the worn upou armored : ships. The trouble iias beeu In the lalluie of comractors to deliver armor as ' agi eed. The difficulties - seem now, however, to have breu all overrome, and armor is being delivered wilt) satisfactory promptness. .As » result of Hie experence acquired by ship puildt-rs and designers and material men. it Is be.ievedthat the cuti>s when ve-sels will be completed can now be estimated with reason able accuracy. Great gnus, rapid firing sun 3, toio'does and powder are being promptly Ihe following vessels of the new navy have neen completed and are now ready for service -Ihe double turreted coast-defense monitor MiHntouomoh, the dotible-iu. reted coaM-de rense mom or Monterey, the armored cruiser V-w iork, the protected cruisers Baltimore Chicago.

It Is also expected that the three gunbnats authorized Dy ihe last Cougress will be completed in less than two years. Since 1886 Conertss has at each session au thonzt-d the buildlnu of one or more vessels aud the Secretaiyof the Navy ureseuis an earnest plea for the contlnuauce of this plan. He recommends the authorization of at least one battle-ship and six lorpeao boats. While I am dislinctlv in favor of consistently pursulug (he policy we have Inaugurated of building up a thorough and efficient navy, 1 caunot refrain from the suggestion that Congress should Cirefully take Into accouut the number of uu finished vessels on our hands aud the depleted coudition of our treasury In considering the propriety of au appropriation at this (hue to begin new work. Ihe method of employing mechanic rl labor at navy-yards through boaids of labor and making efficiency the sole lest by which laborers are employed and continued Is pioduciue Hi-- best results, and the Secretary is earnestly devoting himself to its development. Attentiou is luvited to the statement of his re puu in regard to the workings of the system. HOKE'S PENSION POLICY. The Secretary of the Interior bas the super vision of so many Important subjects that bis report is of especial value aud interest. On the 30th day ol June. 1893, there were on the pen sion-rolls 966,012 names, an increase of 89,944 over the number of the rolls on June, 30, 1892. Of these there were 17 widows and daughters of Revolutionary soldiers, 36 survivors of the war of 1812, 5425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors and widows of tne Mexican war, 3882 survivors aud widows of Indian wars. 284 army nurses and 475,645 ' survivors and widows and children of decea^'d I soldiers and sailors of the war of the rebellion. The greater number of these represent pen sioners on account of disabilities aud death ie sulting from ai my and navy service. The num ber of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 1893, who were peusioned uuder the act of J u ire 27, 1890, which allows pensions on ac count of death aud disabilities not chargeable to army service, was 459,155. The number added to the roils duriDg the year was 123,634, and the number dropped was 33.090. The first payment on pensions allowed during the year amounted to $33,576,549 98. This Includes arrears or accumulations between the lime from which the itllowauce of the peusion dates aud the time of actually granting the certificate. Although ihe law of l«l»o permits pensions for disability not Incurred Id military servlc -, yet as a requisite to its benefit a dis ability must exist incapacitating the applicant from the performance of mauual labor to such a degree as to render him uuablo to earn a supuort. The execution of this law in Its early stages does not seem to have been in accord with Its true hit ntioii, but toward the close of the last administration au authoi iativecou«truction was given to the statute aud siucethat tlm- this con si ruction has been followed. This has had the effect or limltlug ihe operation of the law to its intended purpose. The discovery having beeu made that many names had b en put upon the pension roll by means ot wholesale and gigantic fiauds, the commissioner suspended paymeut upon a num ber of pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or uuauthoiiz d, pending a complete examina tion, giving uotice to the pensioners in order that they might have an opportunity to est b ilsh if possible ihe justice of their claims not withstanding their apparent invalidity. This, 1 understand. Is a practice which has for a long time prevailed lv the Tension Bu reau, but after entering upon these recent in. veslluaMons the Commissioner modified this rule so as not to allow, until after complete ex uiiiin itli'ti into its legality, interleiei.ee with payment of a pension apparently uot atto uether void, but which m n-lv had been fixed at a rate higher than that authorized by the law. lam unable to understand why frauds in the pensiou-ioll< should not be exposed aud corrected with thoroughness aud vigor. Kvery name fraudulently put upon these, rolls is a wicked imposition upon th • kindly seutitneut In which pension* have their origin. Ev-ry fraudulent pensioner has become a bad citizen; every false oath in support of a fraud ulent pension has made perjury more common, and false and uude«eiving pensioners rob the people, uot only of theh money, but of the patriotic seutlmeut which the survivors of tbe war fought for the preservation of ihe Union ought to lusplre. Thousands of neighborhoods have their well-known fraudulent pensioners, an i recent developments by the bureau estab lish appalling conspiracies to accomplish pen sion ti .. mis. By no means the least wrong done is to biave .tflJ deserving pensioners, who cer tainly ought not to be Condemned to such, asso ciation. Those who attempt in ibe line of duty to rec tify these wrongs should uot be accused of enmity or indifference to the claims of honest veterans. ihe sum expended on account of pensions for the year ending June 30, 1893, was £156, --740,467 14. The Commissioner esltm tes that $160,000,000 will be requned to nay pensions dunug tne year ending Juue 30, 1594. JUSTICE TO THE INDIANS. Tne condition or (lie Indians and their, ulti mate tare re subjects which are related to a sacred duty of die Government, and which strongly appeal to in • sense of justice and the sympathy of our people. Our ludian* Dumber about 148,000, most of them relocated ou 161 reservations containing 86,115,581 acres of land, About 110,000 of these Indians have to a laige degree adopted civilized customs. Lands In several Territories have been allo ted to many of them, and such allotments have been made to 10,000 individuals during the last fiscal year, embracing about 1,000,000 acres. The number of Indian schools opened during the year was 195, an Inciease of twelve over me period of the preceding year. Of this total 170 were on reset vatlons, ol which 73 were ding-school* and 97 were day schools. Twenty boarding-schools and day schools >un poited by the Government were not located on i enervations. The total number of Indian children enrolled during the year a* attending all schools was 21.318, an increase of 1231 over the enrollment /or trie pr viou» year. I am sure that secular education and moral and religious leaching mutt be important factors In any t- Sort io savr the Indian and lead him to civilization, l believe, too, ib it the relinquish went of tribal relations and the holding of laud in !<everalty may, under favorable conditions, aid this consummation. It seem* to me, however, tbat the allotments of laud iii neveialty ought to be made with gieater circumspection. If hastily done, before the Indian knows lis meaning, and while yet he has little or no Idea of tilling a farm and no conception of thrift, there Is great danger that reservation life in tribal relations may be ex changed tor the pauperism of civilization in stead of it' Independence and el vat ion. The solution of the Indian problem depends largely on good adminlstiat:on. Th • personal fitness of agents and their adaptability- to the peculiar duty of cat lug for their wards is of the utmost importance. Th law providing that, except In special eases, army officers shall be detailed as Indian agents, it li hoped, will prove a successful ex periment. There Is danger of great abuses cieepiug into the prosecution of claims for In dian depredations, aud 1 recommend that every possible safeguard be provided against the enforcement of unjust and fictitious claims of this description. The appropriations on ac count of Indian claims before the year ending June 30 1894, amounted to 57.954.962 99. ft decrease, as compared wltn the year preceding It, of $387,131 95. *» PUBLIC LAND. The vast areas of land which, but a abort time ago, constituted tbe public domain, are rapidly falling Into private hands. It is certain that in thai transfer the beneficent intention of the Government to supply from Us domains homes o the Industrious and worthy home steaders! Is often frustrated through the sp'cu : lator, who stands with extortionate purpose 'tween the land office and those who, with their families,' are invited by the Government to settle on the public Una. This speculator Is a ■ despicable • character, who ought not to be tolerated; yet It Is difficult to thwart his schemes. The recent opening to settlement of the lands Id the Cherokee outlet, embracing an area of 500,000 acres, notwithstanding the ut most care in framing tbe regulations governing the ".election of locations and notwithstanding the presence of Untied States trooust, furnished an exhibition, Uiougu la a modified degree, of the mad scramble, the violence and ;he fraudu lent occupation which have accompanied pre vious opeuiugs of public lands. 1 concur wltb the Secretary In the belief that these out lageous incidents caunot be entirely prevented without a change tv the laws on the subject, and I hope his recommendations In that direc tion will be favorably considered. 1 especially commend to tli» attention of ■he Cougress the slaiements contained in the Secretary's report concerning registry. The time has come wheu efncl-ot measures should be taken for the preservation of our forests from indlscrlmluate and irremediable destruction. MORTON ON AGRICULTURE. Tn>- report of the Secretary of Agriculture will be found exceedingly Interesting and es pecially to that large body of our citizens inti mately concerned lv grlcultural occupations. Ou the 7lli day of March, 1893, there were upon Its payrolls 2430 employes. This num ber has been reduced to 1850 persons. In view of a depleted public treasury and the impera tive demaud of the people for economy in the administration of the Government, the Secretary has eutered upon the task of ratio nally reducing expenditures by elimination from ihe payroll ot ail persons not needed for an efficient conduct ot the affairs of ihe department. During the first quarter of the present yeai the expenses of ihe department agijregaied $345,976 76, as against $402,021 42 for the corresponding period of the tlscrl year ending Juue 30, 1893. The Secretary niakes apparent his Intention to con tinue this rate of reduction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by $994. --230 than those of the present year. Amoug the heads of divisions in these departments the channes have beeu exceedingly few. Three vacancies occurring i!om deatn and resigna tion have been filled by the promotion of as slstauts lv tie same divisions. These promo tions of experienced and faithful assistants have not only been in the interest of efficient work, but have suggested to those in the depart ments who look tor retention aud promotion that merit aud devotlun to duty are their best reliance. I he amount of appropriation for the Bureau of Animal Industry lor Hie current fiscal year is §850.000. The estimate lor the ensuing year is ?700,000. . . ' ■ ■ - The regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever have been enforced during the last year, and the largest stockyards of the country have been kept free from infection. Occasionally local outbieaks have been largely and effec tually guarded against by ibe owners of (he aflected cattle. While contagions pleuro-i.neu mouia. in cattle his been eradicated, animal tuberulosis, a disease widespread and more dangerous to human lite than pleiiro-pneumo nia, Is Mill prevalent. Investigations have been made durum the past year as to the means or Its communication and the method of | its correct diagnosis. Much progress has been made in this direc tion by the studies of the division of animal pathology, but work ought to be extended in co-operation with local authorities until the danger to human lire arising from this cause is reduced to a minimum. The number of ani mals arriving from Cauada durlns the year and inspected by bureau officers was 462,002 and the number from trans-Atlantic countries was 1297. No contagious diseases were found among the imported animals. The total num brr of Inspections of cattle for export during the past fiscal year was 611.542. The exports show a falling off of about 25 per cent from the preceding year, and the decrease occurs entire ly in the last half of the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely due to an Increase in the price of Amerlcau export cattle. During the year ending June 30, 1893, ex ponsof inspected pork|aggregated 320.677,410 pounds, as against 380,152,374 pounds for tlio preceding year. The falling off in this export was not confined, however, to Inspected pork, the total quantity exported in 1892 being 0uf>. 490.616 pounds, while in 1893 It was only 527,308,696 pounds. 1 join the Secretary in recommending that hereafter each applicant for (he position of in spector or assistant Inspector hi the Bureau of Animal Industry be required, as a condition precedent to his appointment, to exhibit to the United Slates Civil Set vice Commission a diplo ma from an established, regular aud reputable i veterinary college, and that this be supple mented by such an examination Id veterluary science as the commission may prescribe. The expoits of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, attained the enormous figure of $800,000,000 In round numbers, being 78.7 per em of our total exports. In the last fiscal year this amount was greatly reduced, but, nevertheless reached $650,000,000, being 75.1 per cent ot all American commodities exported.

The main purpose of its monthly J reports is to keep the farmers informed as fully as possible of all matters having any influence upon the world's markets in which their products find sale. Its publication rentes especially to tne commer cial side of farming. It is therefore of pro found importance and vital concern to the fanners of the United States, who represent Dearly one-half of our population, and also of direct iuterest to the whole country, that the work of this division be efficiently pei formed and that the Inform ition it has gathered be promptly diffused. It is a matter for congratu lation to know that the Secretary will not spare any effort to make this part of his work thor oughly useful. Id the year 1839 Congress appropriated $1000 to be taken from the Patent Office funds for the purpose of collecting and dis tributing rare and improved varieties of seeds and for prosecuting agricultural investigations and procuring agricultural statistics. From this small beginning the seed division of the Department of Agriculture has grown to its present unwieldy and unjustifiably extrava gant proportions. During the last fiscal year the coil of seeds purchased was $66,548' 61. The remainder of Its app. opriotiou of $135,000 was expended In putting them up and dis tributing them. It surely never could have entered the minds of those who first sanctioned appropriations of ' public money for the pur chase of new and Improved varieties of seeds for gratuitous distribution that from this would grow lame appropriations for the pur chase and distribution by members of Congress - of ordinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings which are common lv all the States and Territories, and everywhere easily obtainable at low prices la each Stale and Territory. An agricultural experiment station has been es ablished. These stations, by their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment wiih and test new varieties of seeds, and yet this indiscriminate and wasteful distribution by legislation aud legislators con tinues, answering do purpose unless it be to remind constituents th .t their representatives are wining to remember them with grati ude at the public cost. Under the sanction of existing legislation, there was sept out from the Agri cultural Department during the last fiscal year euougb of cabbage seed to plant 19,200 acies of land, a sufficient quantity of be ds to plant 4000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2500 acres, sweet corn enough to plant 7800 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2035 acres with vines and enough muskmelou and watermelon seeds to pi tit 2675 acres, the total quantity of flower and vegetable seeds thus distributed was contained In more than ,9,000,000 pack ages, and they were sufficient it planted to cover 89,596 aciesof land. In view of these facts this enormous expenditure without legiti mate returns of ben fit ought to be abolished, and anticipating a consummation so manifestly in the Interests of good administration more than $100,000 has been stricken from the esti mate made to cover this object for the year - ending June 30. 1895. aud imp Secretary rec ommends that the lemalning $35,000 of the esti mate be confined strictly to the putcbase of new and improved varieties of seeds, aud these be distributed through experiment stations. Thus tne seed will be tested and after the test has been completed by the experiment station the propaga ion of ihe useful varieties and the rejection oi the valueless may safely be left to the common-sense of the people.
