There is soon to be in the north western country a battle of giants. It will be waged fiom east of the Rock ies to the every edge of the Pacific ocean, but it will not leave in its wake a trail of desolation and decimation. Instead it will cause the hills to-blos som, the valleys io become towns and fertile farms it will raiso up cities where there are now -only broad ex panses of tenantless land. The fighters are of the kind that build up but nev er tear down, that make two blades of grass grow where only one has ev er grown before. They are of the kind that fight against each other but together fight time and distance. They are railroad giants. The plans of &. H. Harriman for a gigantic railroad construction scheme have been outlined. Nearly ?400,000, 000 are said to) be available for this campaign. There is no limit to the field that will be entered except the natural boundaries of the country. The west is supplied with two or three great railroad systems. They cover a constantly developing field only in a limited sense. In the early days of the west one railroa was enough—and it was sometimes exceedingly expensive to the owners. Thus the divisions of teriptory came, the agreements and the separations and redivisions. The field is growing. James J. Hill first saw its possibilities and with his Great Northern he traversed the transcontin ental highway .clear to Puget sound and -then pieced out some intervening space to China with some big ships. This other master mind in the rail road world—E. H. Harriman—is going still farther. He is going to interlace the wide western territory with branch lines and then with other branch lines until there will be no mile of its pro ductive richness beyond his reach. It is an "encroachment" on the Hill terri tory, to be sure—an intrusion to be met rail for rail and tie for tie but the country is to be the beneficiary and these millions will be planted In material and equipment. Mr. Harri: man's ablest lieutenant, Horace G. CANNON AND HEPBURN. Just as all the world loves a lover, so does all the world love a fighter. It JAS. H. SHEPHERD. "New Shepherd's Ranche." OTTUMWA, IOWA. arranged by mutual friends. Hepburn will be chairmau of the committee on interstate commerce and in that posi tion will have charge of the admini stration railroad rate regulation legis lation. He will mix up in every other fight of importance. This Is inevitable. Partly because he is naturally a fight er and partly because he has had so wide and broad legislative experience and has such backing of good judgment and common sense that he will be drafted whenever there is to be any thing of importance doing." A good fighter is In his element In congress, when he has as important a place as has Col. Hepburn. The story of his appointment illustrates a new side in the character o. Speaker Can non, wno, it seems, though a good fighter himself, is not slow to recog nize that and any other good qualities in .others. Neither does he allow any personal feeling to blind his sight. WITTE STILL HOPES. ». .ict-x HI. ..in w«..m ...v,. .. one with (he other. In short, he wants declining sentimentality. It is true that SUK is not gene.ally known that he and the present speaker, "Uncle Joe" Can- non, were.at outs for a long time, and one would not believe it after seeing the admirable manner in which they lost between them. In spite of this The news that reached America yesterday, to the effect that Count Witte had tendered to the czar his resignation as Russian premier, was received with regret by citizens of the United States who have learned to admire Witte for his splendid work at the Portsmouth peace conference and his fairness and patriotism in dealing with the Japanese. But today news comes that he has not asked to be re lieved but is still working and hoping to be able to control the turbulent na tion. The liberals are massed against Witte, who, if the view of people in this part of the world is not too dis torted, is the best friend they have. The Russians, however, are not con tent to wait for a gradual change in the form of government. Having tast ed aberty they desire to have it for their own always, and do not want to be given any half-way measures. Count Witte is the strongest man Russia has produced, as far as the world knows, in several generations. If anyone can solve the knotty prob lems that exist in Russia he can do it, but he must have the support of the bulk of the people. ,• FOR E S A E E A The Courier publishes a letter today from its Washington correspondent, in which the latter details an interview With a very-influential and powerful with the President's recommendations regarding railroad freight rates, the senate will pass the bill without trouble and without unnecessary delay. The only stipulation is that the bill shall be in accord with the President's message. Burt, once head of the Union Pacific that the idea ijas sprung up, sition of so many people to farm the railroad, has been abroad studying railroad construction and it* is believ ed these mammoth plans will be car ried out under his administration.Next year is likely to be a year of great ac tivity in the west. that this body of men would throttle any railroad rate bill that would do the shippers any good. But everyone, even the railroads, admit that the President's views are sound. He does not ask for a drastic law that would bankrupt the railroads neither will he sanction a law that does not give the shippers equal rights and privileges, is probable that the fighter has "the a square deal for both railroad *nd: better hold upon- the general affections shipper.

IMPROVEMENTS FOR OTTUMWA. Ottumwa, with her new factories, her new buildings, and now her new street car concern, is going ahead faBt this year. The sale of the property of the Ottumwa Traction & Light Co., according to men who are close to the matter, means that the service and the lines of the company will be. im proved and enlarged to such, an ex tent that Ottumwa will soon have a street railway system and a street lighting system that cannot be sur passed by those of any city of similar size in the country. Let the good' work go on. Ottum wa is growing, in population, in busi ness, in financial strength and in pro gressiveness. Let the good work go on, and give It a push when you can.

AN LOWAN'S QUEER 8IQNATURE. St. Louis Globe-Democrat.—A man from Davenport, Iowa, excited much curiosity at the Southern hotel UVlday night and was the innocent cause of heated arguments and offers to place money. It was all because of his sig nature, which consisted of nine strale-ht lines and a curve. The lines were heavily drawn and stood out boldly from the register. So many persons called Clerk Ryan from his books to Inquire what the lines meant that Ryan decided to fln? out for peace sake. He sought out the man, and after a neat Apology asked for a translation of the marks. The gentleman, looked surprised. "That's simple," he said. "To me lt is as plain as A. B. C. It means J.
