A special to the Press from Washington says: Henry C. Payne, the national com mitteeman from Wisconsin. reached Washington last night in. advance of a meeting- of the Republican national committee, which will be held on De cember 12. Mr. Payne said: "In addition to the support already known to be in favor of the proposed change in the basis of representation in the Republican national convention, I find letters and telegrams from V. T. Durbin, member of the national com mittee from Indiana: Gov. P. C. Cheney of New Hampshire. George AY. Childs of Vermont. Charles R. Brayton of Rhode Island and Senator Quay of Pennsylvania all favoring- the change. "The support of these states makes it almost certain that a majority of the committee will favor the proposition.

DELIGHTED FRANCE. President McKinley's Message Struck a Responsive Chord. New Tork, Dec. 7. A dispatch to the Tribune from Paris says: Nearly all the Paris papers today ac cord the place of honor on their front pages to comments on President Mc Kinley's message, which has caused a most favorable and friendly impression. All the papers pay tribute to Presi dent McKinley's allusion to the share the United States is taking in the exhi bition of 1900. an allusion unanimously spoken of as the most timely and grate ful .coming, as it does, so closely upon the heels of Mr. Chamberlain's aggres sive Leicester speech. But it is iu governmental circles, and especially at the foreign office, that the most marked satisfaction is felt at Mr. McKinley's message. At the Quai d'Or say the conviction is expressed that to day in no part of the world is there any possible point of friction between, the two republics. In China the Ignited States will find no power more anxious, heartily and loyally to co-operate in the maintenance of the "open door" than France is. There is also a community of interests between the two republics in the trans isthmian canal, for it is now absolutely immaterial to the Frenchogovernment whether the Panama or the Nicaragua or any other route be decided upon. The only interest of France in the matter is that the republic of Ecuador shall not be at liberty to sell or cede to England, or to any European power, the Oala pagos islands, which, in the opinion of French naval authorities, would give England a strategic command of the future trans-isthmian canal similar to that which possession of Aden secures for her in regard to the Suez canal. AT THE 

PLAY LAST NIGHT. Irish farce comedy has become a synonym for tiresome and vulgar horse play, painful vocal efforts and mediocre specialty features because of the ex istence of such pieces as "McCarthy's Mishaps." seen at the Cra wford.theater Wednesday night. Regardless of this fact, however, such stage "productions' continue to enjoy prosperity, as was demonstrated by the size of the audi ence that saw it in Topeka last night. Harney Ferguson, who has the lead ing part, is said to be as- deaf as a post, and gives evidence of the fact by refusing to allow the audience to un derstand his lines half the time. This probably amounts to kindness on the part of Mr. Ferguson, judging from the lines that are intelligible. The com pany gives evidence of being a bargain sale aggregation, and the only feature having a taint of cleverness about if is the dancing of D4ek Ferguson, the "star's" son. Robert Jackson does some old acrobatic work acceptably, and Miss Grace Passmore sings a, "coon" song rather realistically. FINISH STATE HOUSE.

If Cali fornia plays Carlisle, it will probably take on the Los Angeles club for New Year's day. A CHECK TO OSTEOPATH Y. Practitioneer In Nebraska Found Guilty of Violating Medical Law. Lincoln, Neb.. Dec. 7. Dr. Charles W. Little, a practitioneer in the school of osteopathy, was last night found e-uiltv of a violation of the medical laws of the state by a jury in the district court. The action was begun by the state board of health. It is the first test case in the state and if the decision is up held by the supreme court, to which the case will be appealed, it will stop the practice of osteopathy in Nabraska, 3 So DEMANDS MADE. Santa Fe Shop Men Want a New Schedule. Greiranee Committee Waits on the Officials. 31AAY INEQUALITIES. Piece Work System Needs Much Reconstruction. Workmen Want the Differences Straightened Oat. Firm In Position and Will Not Be Swerved. A' grievance committee, appointed by the car builders of the Santa Fe shops, met with the officials of the Santa Fe road Wednesday afternoon, and laid be fore them their demand for a new schedule and the immediate equitable adjustment of the differences which ex ist between the workmen and the com pany on account of what they claim is the unfair schedule of wages paid in the piece work system in operation at the Santa Fe shops. If the officials of the Santa Fe road accede to the demand of this committee and give the workmen a fair schedule and fair treatment in this piece work matter, then there is a possibility that the anticipated walk out of the several hundred men who are employed in the various departments of the Santa Fe shops in this city will be declared off. On Tuesday evening of this week the car builders held a meeting. Every car builder was there and the subject of piece work and the schedule of wages was thoroughly discussed. Every one present had a chance to express himself on. the matter, and nearly every one took opportunity to tell what he knew and what he thought about the piece work system as being operated in the shops here. At this indignation meeting of the car builders, after the matter had been thoroughly discussed and talked about, it was decided best to appoint a com mittee of three to wait upon the head officials of the road here and lay the facts of the case before them. It was brought out at the meeting that per haps the officials were jiot aware of the true state of affairs, and if such be the case, then it was proper that they be apprised of the matter and be given an opportunity of righting the difficulty before any serious steps were taken. Affairs at the car sheds have been as suming deperate shape during the past few days and the continued quitting of many of the btst car men was gradual ly depopulating the shop and leaving the inefficiency of that department in a diminished condition. Many of those who did not give up their positions were unable to make wages, but held on to their work in hopes that relief would come. Of those who did make wages, many were compelled to work unusual ly hard to do so. Something had to be done, and as a last resort an indigna tion meeting was quietly planned for Tuesday night and the men were given opportunity to give vent to their pent up feelings which . had been consider ably worked up during the past few days. The men do not find fault with the piece work system especially, for the trouble lies in the fact that an unfair schedule of wages is being paid. If this schedule of wages is fixed up and a fair scale of wages is paid which will properly cover the operation of the piece work system at the Topeka shops, then, without a doubt, the men will feel kindly toward the piece work sys tem. 'What the men want is a fair schedule of wages and it makes no dif ference to them whether they earn their money under the piece work system or make it at so much per day. One of the things which has created much hard feeling and which was one of the grievances which the committee was to lay before the officials, was the cutting of the wages pid for different piece work articles by tn bosses in the car sheds when they found that the men were making a little too much money on these certain piece work ar ticles. Such action has been taken more than once and the car men feel that it was done without the sanction of the officials, and consequently they ought to be informed. It seems that part of the present schedule of wages to be paid in the car sheds, has been made up from that of eastern shops, which have the piece work system of working. These shops in the east, have the facilities and con veniences for the successful operation of the piece work system, which are lacking at the Santa Fe shops In this city. In the eastern shops, the mater ial is laid down beside the workmen and all he has to do is to work on continuously without a thought of pro curing more material, as he knows it will be forthcoming when needed. Here in the Topeka shops, the material is not gotten out in quantities, which will enable the men to work continuously, and the men have many times to go quite a distance to procure the mater ial which they need. The wage sched ule, which would fit the needs of the eastern shop, under such circumstances, will not lit the needs of the shops here, and pay the men living wages. Again the schedule for the repair work has been made out to fit the av erage car. in supposition that the gangs of workmen will get equal numbers of good and bad cars. If a gang should get a string of poor cars every day for any length of time, then they could not make wages. If they should get a string of other cars, which would have to be entirely rebuilt, then the men can make good living wages. It is such inequalities as these in the schedule which will have to be fixed up if any thing like fairness is done to the men. Part of the present schedule was made out lower than the company agreed that the work could be done. For instance, in the building of cars, the company originally allowed 120 hours to build a car. The different gangs of men. working on the cars, ri valed each other in getting the cars built in the least possible time, when there was a rush for cars. The com pany's allowance of 120 hours was cut lower and lower, until it was gotten down to 80 hours, where it now stands, and it was on the basis of SO hours for the building of a car that the com pany took when making out the pres ent schedule. The men in the car sheds want a fair schedule of wages. They want a new schedule. One which will adjust the differences in the price paid for the various grades of work and one which will pay them fair living wages. The present schedule in many particulars is unfair. Part of the men are working on the new work and are making wages, but they are having to work hard to do it. Not a minute is lost and the material for the new work is laid down where they can easily set it, but the new work is not going to last al ways, and these men will soon have to go on repair work, until the mill can get out material enough to build an other batch of cars. Of the 50 or more men who have thus far quit work in the car sheds, over four-fifths of them are good car men, and only a very few of them have been poor workmen. These car men are good mechanics and capable of taking charge of a gang of men. By the loss of such men as these, the efficiency of the shops is badly crippled. The other departments of the Santa Fe shops, in which the pieoe work sys tem of working has not yet been put into operation, have held meetings and organized, and will be ready to meet the piece work squarely when it comes into their respective departments. These departments have taken time by the forelock and in view of the trouble which the piece work has caus ed in the car sheds, they are determin ed to be ready to meet it in good shape and avoid such friction, when it is introduced. 

GILLETT A SICK MAN. Cattle Plunger a Victim of Fever Mrs. Oillett In a Pesthouse With the Smallpox. Kansas City, Dec. 7. Misfortune has overtaken Grant C. Gillett, the cattle plunger, who is now in Chihuahua, Alex. He is critically ill with a fever, and his wife is in a Mexican pest house at death's door with smallpox. This is the news brought from Mexico by D. de R. demons, of Escalo-n, who arrived in Kansas City last night. "Gillett has disposed of his interest in the Hotel El Commercio," said Mr. de mons, "and I do not know just what he was following. The last news I have of him is that he is very sick and that his wife has the smallpox. The disease is unusually fatal to those from the states when they catch it in Mexico, and Mrs. Gillett's chances for recovery are slen der." Mr. Clemons was for years night edi tor of the Buffalo Courier. He has been in Mexico a number of years and is now chief clerk in the transportation de partment of the Mexican Northern rail way. GERMANY TO RELENT. A Feeling of Reciprocal Treaty With XT. S. Beginning to Prevail. New Tork, Dec. 7. A special to the Herald from Washington, D. C, says: Considerable satisfaction is felt in official circles at the awakening of Germany to the need of a reciprocity treaty with the United States. It has been the expectation of the authorities that this would effect the treaty of reciprocity negotiated with France, not only upon Germany, but upon all Europe as well. When its operation begins the auth orities sav that German interests will immediately begin to feel its effect. The board throughout the German em pire are of a semi-official character and preliminary to trade negotiations it is customary for the German government to consult them. Before embarking upon reciprocity negotiations with this country, the German government de sires to obtain the views of several boards of trade, which in the past have been hostile to American products. The dispatch, published from Berlin in the Herald this morning, showing the necessity for Germany of a commercial arrangement with the United States indicates to the officials that the boards of trade are beginning to appreciate the effect of the commercial agreement with France and fear the injury which will be done by the treaty and instead of opposing concessions, will now be willing that the government should take action. While proposals have been exchanged between the two governments, I was told today that the Berlin authorities have been waiting for favorable public opinion before pushing the negotiations to a completion. The president's recommendation that congress authorize an invitation to Germany for the constitution of a joint commission of scientific experts and practical men of affairs to conduct a searching investigation of food produc tion and exportation in both countries and report remedial measures is not to affect the reciprocity negotiations with Germany, provided that government is willing to push them, though the pres ident specifically states that such in vestigation should be made in connec tion with thend pending reciprocity ne gotiations. The administration does not propose to delay the negotiations when they are earnestly commenced by investigation, provided the German government shows a disposition to hasten them to a conclusion.

RAGING FLOOD. Washington Stream Endangers Much Valuable Property. Tacoma, Wn., Dec. 7. Practically the whole of the Stuck river valley is one vast sheet of water. The river itself is a raging flood, destroying acres of the most productive land in the state and threatening some substantial dwel lings. It is higher than ever before known since the valley was settled by white men. Several families in the vi cinity of Sumner have been compelled to move to escape the torrent. The rise in the river since the recent heavy rains has been the greatest and most rapid ever known. Seventeen in ches in one hour is recorded at Sum ner and now the water is between six and seven feet above the ordinary high level. At present the damage throughout the valley as a result of the freshet cannot be estimated.

Hutton writes from the Hotel Ephesus, Ayasolouk, Asia Minor: "Travelers in the Levant think of Ephesus as a place where there are many associations, but little to see. But the recent excavations by the Aus trians have altered all that, and as the work Is but little known I take the lib erty of writing to you on the subject. The great theater has been excavB.ted, the whole of the columns of the pro scenium and the passage and a nte room with mosaic pavements have been opened up, and work is going on !5till in the upper portions of the theater. In front is the street, with the marks of the chariot wheels all along rMe pavements. There is also the whole series of buildings behind and undetr neath the gymnasium, Including sonae lovely marble water troughs with oxm and oax wreaths and some fin? marbrs doorways, all in situ. But perhaps the. most interesting thing is that which is now being excavated the lovely semi circular maroie portico with its steps, which occupied the whole east side of the harbor. What there is now is most beautiful and interesting.and each week discloses something new. Perhaps to Christians there is the most interest ing thought that St. Paul landed at these steps, and we can take our place with him in the theater. It is quite im possible to do justice to all the sights in a morning, and visitors who wish to stay longer will find Karponza. the landlord of the hotel, a very obliging and intelligent man, and the accommo dations comfortable."
