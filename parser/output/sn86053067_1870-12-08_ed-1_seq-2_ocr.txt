THE JOURNAL. CAMDEN', DECEMBER 8, 1870. President's Message. We ere indebted to the Daily Unvn for an extra containing the Prcsdent's Message. Fire. On Sunday evening about half past 6 o'clock P. M., the alarm of fire was v given, and after proceeding in that direction, it was ascertained that the barn of Mr. F. L. Phelps, was on fire; Mr. Phelps' son, who first discovered the fire, informs us that one end of tho barn was nearly ready to full in when he discovered it. He ai&o said that there had been no fire about the barn on that day, nor was lie in uic.nauii, ui carrying a light there to feed hisliorses. So that it is considered the work of an incendiary, beyond question. Scmiic twenty five or thirty bushels of cotton seed and some fodder were destroyed Another alarm was given 12 >1. yesterday, and arose from the burning of Mr. J. M. LeGrand's chimney, which resulted in no damage whatever, beyond frightening the female portion of the iumates. Sales Day. ' Monday last being sales day, there were certain tracts of land sold by the Sheriff, some to satisfy executions and come by order of the Circuit Coutt and Probate Judge. Oue would have imagined from the . - ? small attendance of buyers and the low prices obtained, that lie had returned to sales day for July or August ? We have never before known such low prices at such favorable rate*, for the uiooth of December, and cannot but regard it as an indication of the poverty stricken condition of our people. Lands would have brought better prices in 1865, just after the war. We offer Radical ! misrule for a solution of the ^ucsticu. Can any one correct us. ? United States Senator. Several ineffectual ballots for Unired States Senator were held on Tuesday. Among the nominees we see tho na:nc of Gen. M. C. Butler, who received 7 votes in the Senate and 22 ia the House. t. , The Snrvivor's Association. The members of this Association for Kershaw District, are determined to celebrate the occasion of their annual meeting with a speech and a supper, ii their funds will permit, on the evening of the 20th instant. In our next issue, we will endeavor to give a sketch of the programme, iti eluding the name of the speaker for the occasion and his theme. Meantime, all members are notified in order that they may attend, and - !.???? ?n,i reauer me uccuaiuu a nappj ?j? re-union of the soldiers of old Kershaw District. All wlio served honorably, durinp the war, are entitled to membership, .and we hope that many who hare not ?8 yet, will be enrolled, on or before the 20th inst. Let us all take pride in being part and parcel of that gallant band oi 53,000 soldiers sent by South Carolina ioto the field, of whom upwards ol 12,000 died the death of heroes. Significant movements. Many of our readers who are unable to provide themselves with the great metropolitan jonrnals, arc, no doubt, in comparative darknebs in regard tc the means employed in the great State of Missouri, in the late election, to carry it for the conservatives. They nominated for Governor, lion B. Grutz Brown, who is a liberal Be publican, and an advocate for reform ir flAvvtw.A Tim nntiiwiiirn w?n IUC Civil OCl *UV. 4 IIV ? ?. fought, upon very much the same plat form as that of the Union Reform Purtj hi this State. Their watchwords were "retrenchment and reform, acquies' - cence in the result of the legislation o Congress without regard to the colorcc people, and general amnesty to all wh: were disfranchised by reason of partici potion in the rebellion." The result was the redemption of tin State from Radical misrulo by a larg< majority. As in this State, so in Mis souri there were those who call them selves "white man's government"' sd vocates, but in? no instance were thej successful, and their opposition onlj served to show, how large a majority of the whites approved of and upheit the policy of acquiescence iu accom plished facts, and their dcterminatioi uot to revive thoso old and dead ques tions, upon which the country was di jVided iu 1863. Their policy, like ours ' was progressive, and it demonstrates tlx wisdom of our action, that other part of this great country arc determine* that war questions shall be abolished aDd only those measures adopted whicl tend to our advancement in materia prosperity, and tho building up of ou waste places. In other words, Sout! Carolina is two years ahead of most o her sister States, in political wisdor god foresight. P^ V/ f ^,-V ; > . y From Scima, Ala. Wo havo been permitted to mate the following extract from the letter of ( a lady of Selma, to her friend in 1 this place: ' Selma, Nor. 13,1370. \ "The change from the quic: streets of Camden, to the more bu-y ones of Selma I find very decided, and the sppcaranccs indicate a prosperity very desirable for your once prosperous town. Arc you never to have a revival of your former prosperity, when you could boast of trade by the millions? Although the war aud its events have left their mark upon your town and its inhabitants, may not the stagnation bc-churged in a measure to a want of energy on the part of your citizens ? have they not fo'ded their hands and been Waiting, Muccawber-likc, for something to turn . J e ?? *k?:?. ?i up, lusicnu Ul. pulling men iiuuuiuuia to the wlici'l, and by a lonjr pull, and a pull altogether, endeavored to raise the old town from her present depressed condition ? Why have the once contemplated Rail llouds been suffered to die unnatural deaths? Two years since when in your town the subject was all the talk, but in a recent visit 1 found the subject completely tabooed. Surely the salvation of tne people of Kersjiaw should prompt them D one combined effort to regenerate their fallen fortunes, for those who would be prospered, like those who would ho free, must strike the blow themselves. It is very true that your State in gonera], as well as jour especial portion has been, and unfutunately is again cursed with fori ign rule that is fast sapping her prosperity, yet South Carolina is not alone in her misfortunes; other States are equally afflicted, but they have not b.-cu perhaps so supine. After leaving Carolina you meet with continued evidences of prosperity, both towns and cities are on the increase.? n.. ... . . .

She is rising Phoenix like from her ashes. Selma, although not so harshly dealt with as some of our Southern ciiie", yet she was crippled in her commercial affairs to a largo extent, but she is fust j coming up to her former prosperous condition. The contemplated network of Hail Holds is being pushed to a con1 elusion that will give her cularged fa? > cililies. 'J ho Memphis and Selma I road under the charge of Geo.
