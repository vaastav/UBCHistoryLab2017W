Money and Bacon. memlK;rs of the senate foreign relations committee, agreed to a favor able reiort ou that document at the meeting of the committee yesterday, during wnicn the provisions' of the treaty were reviewed very fully by the committeemen. Bacon and Money were the only ones who harpl;- criti cised II. especially for its reten.ion of the neutrality idea of the Clayton Bnlwer treaty. The parts of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty referred to in the new treaty where it says it is not intended to inv Tariff Reflected parr -rne general principle or neutral ization established in article S" of that convention, is as follows: "In grant ing, however, their joint protection to any such canals or railways as are by this article specified, it is always un derstood that the same canals or rail ways, being open to the citizens and subjects of the I'nited States and Great Britain on equal terms, shall also le open on like terms to the citi zens and subjects of every other state which is willing to grant thereto such piotfttion as the T'nited States and Great Britain engage to afford." Senators Money and Bacon did not go to the extent of voting against the report of the treaty, and thej- acknowl edge they are anxious to see it ratified because of their great desire to have the canal built. Still, they insist that the treaty as It stands would be very, objectionable in case of. war. They also made objection to the clause spe cifically authorizing the 1'nlted States to police the canal as placing a limita tion on the Hver of this country to control it absolutely. The treaty will be reported to the senate Monady. probably, and some senators hope to have action before the iiolidav roess.

Van Tots, personal bodyguard of (Jiiccn Wil heltnina of Holland, is reported l le dead in a dispatch received from Amsterdam. Whether his death was due to the duel he is said t hae fought with Prince Henry, husband of (Jucen Wilhelmina, or whether he succumbed to sickness seems impos sible of definite ascertainment. When, however. -Maj. Van Tets" con dition was first announced to be crit iool it was said that in the event of his death a statement concerning the alleged duel ami the unhappiness in the royal family would 1 publish ed to the world. This statement had been written by Maj. Van Tets and it was said that t not only confirm ed the story of the duel and the in fliction by Prince Henry of a dan gerous wound, but that it also con firmed the reports of the prince's harsh treatment of Holland's belov ed queen. In dew of the many minors that have been started nnd denied by nil except the persons most interested as to the situation in the royal household of Holland this statement is awaited with .feverish interest. Upon its disclosures depends proba bly -whether the Dutch people shall continue to look tixn the prince consort as a monster or whether he shall be purged of the charge of in humanity toward his wife.

Senator Jules Siegfried, the former minister of com merce, who recently vLsited the I'nited Suites, greatly impressed his hearers with his arguments i:i favor of reci procity lH-twien the two countries.

FOR THE MINERS barging That the Company Knew That Its Contention Was Wrong. Topcka. Kan., Doc. 7. Judge Frank Doster. c-hl'.-f justice of the Kansas su pieni" court, arbitrator by "agreement of the parties concerned in a conten tion between the coal mine operators and the United Mine Workers of dis trict 1-1. gave a decision in favor of the mine workers, as follows: The mat ter submittvd to arbitration was the question of the proper interpretation of that clause of t!:" wage scale of V.HMI which nyid. "Double-shifted en tries LT ecu is per yard extra." Judge Doster held that the oMrat rs knew th.1t the miners attached to the term "double shift" the signification of two men working together: there fore' I he promise to pay extra for work in "double-shifted" entries must be un derstood in the sen-e in which the operators knew the mirers ued the term, because of the familiar rule that a promise will be enforced in Hie sense that the promisor knew the promisee understood it. terta"i a genuine belief in the' good ness of the president's intentions, we should regard his- diagnosis of the in dustrial situation as insincere.'' The Speaker's word picture of the A ide-f-prend ruin, oorrrpt ion. economic ty ranny ami domestic atliiciioii brewing over in Ann-rica as the result of trust domination would be a revelation to the most ardent anti-trust advocate in the United States. The Saturday Ueview. on the other hand, remarks: "All industrial under takings in the United States are more sou-lit ifieally organized than in any other country, as we have learned to our cost. The trust is the develop ment of this system of scientific organ ization and tiie president is right when he- declines to hamper the captains of industry."' Turning to the canal treaty, how ever. The Saturday Ueview declare Croat Britain has sacrificed everything to gain the problematical friendship of the United States, "which will last just so long as it takes America to build a licet, and not a day beyond." The Outlook is mildly commendatory of the message. It says: "The an archist programme is splendid in the ory, but in practice it is impossible." As regards reciprocity The Outlook re marks: "Frankly, sellish America will ac-ept freely whatever benefits hei'self, but will ho careful that no infant in--dustry is squeezed out of the perambu lator."
