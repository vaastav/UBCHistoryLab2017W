The following is the president's animal message to the congress of the United States: The assemblage within the nation's leg islative balls of those charged with the duty of making laws for the benefit of a generous and free people impressively suggests the exacting obligation and inex orable responsibility involved in their task. At the threshold of such labor now to be undertaken by the congress of the United States and in the discharge of nu executive duty enjoined by the con stitution, I submit this communication, containing a brief statement of the con dition of our national affairs aid recom mending such legislation as seems to me necessary and oxpediont. The history of oar recent dealings with other nations and our peaceful relations with them at this time additionally dem onstrates the advantage of consistently adhering ton firm, but just foreign policy i free from envious or ambitious national schemes and characterized by entire hen esty and sincerity. During the past year pursuant to a law of congress, commissioners were ap pointed to the Antwerp industrial expo sition. Though the participation of American exhibitors fell far short of completely illustrating our national in genuity and industrial achievements, yet it was quite croditnblo in view of the brief timo allowed for preparations. I have 

ENDEAVORED TO IMPBBS9 upon the Belgian government the Heed lessness and positive harmfulness of its restriction upon the importation of our food products and have strongly urged that the rigid supervision and inspection under our laws are amply sufficient to prevent the deportation from this coun try of diseased cattle and unwholesome moat. The termination of the civil war in Brazil has been followed by the general prevalence of peace and order, it ap pearing at an early stage of the insurrec tion that its oourse would call for un usual watchfulness bn the part of this government, our naval foroe in the har bor of Bio Janeiro was strengthened. This precaution, I am satisfied, tended to restrict the issue to a simple trial of strength between the Brazilian govern ment and the insurgents, and to avert complications which, at times, seemed imminent. Onr firm attitude, of neutral ity was maintained to the end; the insur gents reoeived no encouragement ef eventual asylum from our oommaaders; nnd such opposition as they encountered was for the protection of our commeroe and was clearly justified by public law. A serious tension of relations having arisen at the close, of the war between Brazil and Portugal by reason , of the esr cape of the insurgent, Admiralde Gamma nnd his followers, the friendly offices of our representatives to those countries were exerted for the protection of the subjects of either within the territory of the other. Although the government of Brazil was duly notified that the com mercial arrangements existing between the United States and that country, based on the third section of the tariff act of 1890, was abrogated on August 9, 1891, by the taking effect of the tariff law now in force, that government subsequently notified the United States of its intention - to terminate such arrangement on the first day of January, 1895, in the exercise of the right reserved in- the agreement be- ' tween the two countries. I invite a reference to the correspondence between the secretary of state and the Brazilian minister en this subject. The commission organized under the conference which had been entered into with Chili, for tho settlement of the out standing claims of each government against the other, adjourned at the nd of the period stipulated for its continu ance, leaving undetermined a number of American cases which had been duly pre sented. These olaims are not barred and negotiations are in progress for their sub mission to a new tribunal. On the 27th of March last a NEW TREATY WITH CHINA in further regulation of emigration was signed at Washington and on Angust 18 it reoeived the sanction of the senate. Ratification on the part of China aid formal exchange are awaited to give ef fect to this mutually beneficial convention. A gratifying recognition of the uni form impartiality of this country to wards all foreign etates was manifested by the coincident request of the Chinese and . Japanese governments that the agents of the United States within her proper limits should afford proteotion to the subjects of the others daring the sus pension of diplomatic relations due to a state of war. This delicate office was ac cepted and a misapprehension whioh gave rise to the belief that, in affording this kindly unofficial protection, our agents wonld exercise the same authority whioh the withdrawn agents of the belig erents had exercised, was promptly cor rected. Although the war between China and Japan endangers no policy of the United States, it deserves our gravest consideration, by reason of its disturb ance of our growing commercial interest in the two countries and the increased danger which may result to our citizens domiciled or sojsurning in the interior of China. Acting under a stipulation in onr treaty with Korea, (the first oonoluded with a western power), I felt constrained at the beginning ef the controversy to tender our good offices to induce AN AMICABLE ABBANQEMENT of the initial difficulty growing out of the Japanese demand for administrative re forms in Korea, but tno unhappy precipi tation of aotual hostilities defeated this kindly purpose. Deploring the destruct ive war between the two most powerful of the eastern nations, and anxions that dur commercial interests in those coun tries may be preserved, and that the safe ty of our citizens there shall not be jeop ardized, I would not hesitate to heed any intimation that our friendly Bid for the honorable termination of hostilities would be acceptable to both belliger ents. A convention has been finally con cluded for the settlement by arbitration of the prolonged dispute with Ecuador, growing out of the proceedings against ismilio Santos, a naturalized citizen of the United States. Acting upon the reported discovery of Texas fever in cargoes ef American cat tle, the German prohibition against im portations of livo stock and fresh meats from this country has been revived. It is hoped that Germany will soon become convinced that the inhibition is as need less as it is harmful to mutual interests. The German government has protested against that provision of the customs tar iff act whioh imposes a discriminating duty of one-tenth of 1 cent a pound on sugars coming from countries paying an export bounty thereon, olaiming that the exaction of such duty is in contravention of articles 5 and 9 of the treaty of 1823 with Prussia. In the interests of the commerce of both countries and to avoid even the accusation of treaty violation, I recommend the repeal of so much of the statute as imposes that duty and I invite attention to the accompanying report of the secretary of state containing a dis cussion of the questions raised by the German protests. The boundary of British Guinea still remains in dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela. Believing that its early settlement on some j net basis alike hon orable to both parties is in the line of our established polioy to remove from this hemisphere all causes of difference with powers beyond the sea, I shall renew the efforts heretofore made to bring about a restoration of diplomatic relations be tween the disputants and to induoe a ref erence to arbitration, a recourse which Great Britain so conspicuously favors in prinoiple and respeots in practioe and which is earnestly sought by her weaker adversary. - Since commnmcating the voluminous correspondence IN EEOA11D TO HAWAII and the action taken by the senate and house of representatives on certain ques tions submitted te the judgment and wider discretion of congress, the organ ization of a government in the place of the provisional arrangement which fol lowed the deposition of the queen has been announced, with evidence ef its effective operation. The recognition nsual in such oases has been accorded the new government. Under our present treaty of extradition with Italy, miscarriages of justice have occurred, owing to the refusal of that government te surrender its own subjects. Thus far pur efforts to negotiate an amended convention, obviating this dif ficulty, have been unavailing. Apart from the war in which the island empire is engaged, Japan attracts increasing at tention in this conntry by her evident desire to onltivate more liberal inter course with us nnd to seek oar kindly aid in furtherance ef her laudable desire for complete autonomy in her domestic af fairs and equality in the family of na tions. The Japanese empire of to-day is no longer the Japan of the past and eur relations with this progressive nation should net be less broad and liberal than those with other powers. Good will, fostered by many interests in common, has marked our relations with our nearest southern neighbor. Peace being restored along her northern frontier, Mexico has asked the punishment of the late disturbers of her tranquility. There ought to be a new treaty of commerce and navigation with that country to take the place of the one whioh terminated thirteen years ago. The friendliness of the intercourse between the two countries is attested by the fact that during this long period the commerce of each has steadily increased under the rule of mu tual consideration, being neither stimu lated by conventional arrangements nor retarded by jealous rivalries or selfish desires. An indemnity tendered by Mexico as a graoions act for the murder, in 1871, of Leon Baldwin, an Amerioan citizen, by a band of marauders in Durango, has been accepted and is being paid in install ments. ' The problem of the storage and nse of the waters of THI BIO 

OSAND8 FOB IBBIOATION should be solved by appropriate concur rent aotion of the two interested coun tries. Rising in the - Colorado heights, the stream flows intermittingly, yielding little water during the dry months to the irrigating channels already constructed along its course. The scarcity is often severely felt in the regions where the river forms a oommon boundary. More over, the frequent changes in its oourse through level sands often raise embarass iog questions of territorial jurisdiction Prominent among the questions of ter ritorial jurisdiction prominent among tne questions ot the year was THE DLEWFIELD8 INCIDENT, in what is known as the Mosquito Indian strip, bordering on the Atlantio ooean, and within the jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By the treaty of 1860, between Great Britain and Nicaragua, the former gov ernment expressly recognized the sov ereignty of the latter over the strip and a limited form of self government was guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians to be exeroised according to their cus toms for themselves and other dwellers within its limits. The so-called native government, which grew to be largely made up of aliens, for many years dis puted the sovereignty of Nicaragua over the strip and claimed the right te main tain the reign practically independent of municipal government. Early in the past year, the efforts of Nioaragua to maiutain sovereignty over the Mosquito territory led to serious disturbances, culminating in the suppression of native government and the attempted substitu tion of an impracticable compact ad ministration, in which Nicaragua and alien residents were to participate. The failure was followed by an insurrection, which, for a time, subverted Nicaraguan rule, expelling her officers and restoring the old organization. This, in time, gave place to the existing local govern ment established and upheld by Nicar agua. Although the alien interests arrayed against Nicaragua in these transactions have been largely American and the com meroe of that region for some time has been, and still is, chiefly controlled by onr citizens, we can not, for that reason, challenge the rightful sovereignty ef Nicaragua over this important part of her domain. For some months, one, and during part of the term, two of onr naval ships have boon stationed at Blewflclds for the proteotion of all the legitimate interests of our citizens. In September last, the government at Managua expelled from the territory twelve or more for eigners, including two Americans for al leged participation in the seditious or revolutionary movements against the re public at Blewfields, alroady mentioned. Though the earnest remonstration of this government, the two Americans have been permitted to return to the peaceful man agement of their business. Our naval commanders, at the scene of this disturb ance, by the constant exhibition of firm nessnnd good judgment, have contributed largely to the prevention of more serious consequences and to the restoration of qniet and order. 1 regret that, in the midst of these occurences, there opened a 

MOST QRAVE, IUBITATINO FAILUEB of Nioaraguan justice. An American citizen, named Wilson, residing at Rama, in the Mosqnito territory, was murdered by one Argnello, the acting governor of the town. After some delay the murder er was arrentod, but so insecurely oon llned or guarded that he escaped, and notwithstanding our repeated demands it is clnimed that his recapture has been im possible by reason of his flight beyond Nicaraguan jurisdiction. The Nicaragnan authorities, having giving notice of a forfeiture of their con cession to the canal company, on grounds purely technical and not embraced in the contract, receded from that position. Peru, I regret to say, shows symptom of domestio disturbance, due probably to the slowness Of her reouperation from the war of 1881. Weakened in resources, her difficulties in facing international ob ligations invite our kindly sympathy and justify our forbearance in pressing long pending olaims. I have felt constrained to testify this ..sympathy in connection with certain demands urgently preferred by other powers. , . The recent death of the ezar of Russia called forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and sympathy on the part of our government with his bereaved family and the Russian people. The government ef Salvador, having been overthrown by AN ABBIiFT POPULAB OUTBBEAK, certain of its military and civil offioers, while hotly pnrsned by infuriated insur gents, sought refuge on board the United States warship Bennington, then lying in a Salvadorean port. Although the prac tice of asylum is not favored by this gov ernment, yet, in view of the imminent peril whioh threatened the fugitives and solely from considerations of humanity, they were afforded shelter by onr naval commander; and when nfterward de manded under our treaty of extradition with Salvador for trial on the charges of murder, arson and robbery, directed that saoh of them as had not voluntarily left the ship be conveyed to one of our near est ports, where a hearing could be had before a judioial officer in compliance with the terms of tho treaty. On their arrival at San Francisco such n proceed ing was promptly instituted before the United States district judge, who held that the sots constituting the alleged of fenses were politioal and discharged all the aooused, except Cienfuegues, who was held for an attempt to murder. Thereupon, I was constrained to direot his release for the reason that an attempt i to murder was not one of the crimes charged against him, and upon which his surrender to the Salvadorean authorities had been demanded. Unreasonable and unjust fines imposed by Spain on the vessels and commerce of the United States have demanded from time to time during the last twenty years earnest remonstrance upon the part of our government. In the immediate past, exorbitant penalties have been imposed npon our vessels and goods by the cus toms authorities of Cuba and Porto Rice for clerical errors of tho most trivial character' in the manifests or bills of lading. '' In some cases, fines amounting to thousands of dollars have been levied upon cargoes) or of the carrying vessels, wherein the goods in question were en titled to free entry, fines have been ex acted even when the error has been cor rected and the Spanish authorities noti fied before the arrival of the goods in port. This conduct is in strange con trast with the considerate and liberal treatment extended to Spanish vessels and cargoes in our ports in like oases. No satisfactory settlement of these vex ations questions lias yet been reached. The Mora cases, referred to in my last annual message, remain unsettled. From tho diplomatic correspondence on this subject, whioh has been laid before the senate, it will be seen that this govern ment has offered to conclude a conven tion with Spain for THE DISPOSAL BY ABBITBATION of outstanding claims between the two countries, except the Mora claim, which, having been long ago adjusted, now only awaits payment as stipulated, and of course it could not bo inoluded in the proposed convention. It was hoped that this offer would remove parliamentary obstacles encountered by the Spanish government in providing payment of the Mora indemnity. I regret to say that no definite reply to this offer has yet been made and all efforts to secure payment of this settled claim have been unavailing. In my last annual message, I adverted to the olaim on the part of Turkey of the right to expel, as persons undesirable and dangerous, Armenians naturalized in the United States and returning to Turk ish jurisdiction. - Numerous questions in this relation have arisen. While this government acquiesces in the asserted right of expulsion, it will not oonsent that Armenians may be im prisoned or otherwise punished for no other reason than having acquired, with out imperial consent, American citizen ship. Three of the assailants of Miss Melton, an American teacher in Mosul, have been convicted by the Ottoman courts, and I am advised that an appeal against the acquittal af the romaiuing nvo has been taken by the Jurkigh prose cuting officers. I A convention has been concluded with Venezuela for the arbitration of a long- disputed claim growing out of the seizure of certain vessels, the property of citizens of the United States.

(Continued on 4th Pose.) MET TO-DAY, The Second Session of the 53d Con gress is Called to Order at Noon. Highest of all in Leavening Power. Latest U. S. Gov't Report Most of the Notables on Hand The President's Message Received Other Washington Notes. Washington, Deo. 8. The opening of the seoond session of the 63d congress, after a reoeas of three months, made the oapitol building the center of interest to day. There was added interest owing to the politioal revolution which has recent ly occurred. Then the president's mes sage was to be presented to both houses and this meant that there conld be no sharp debates, as the reading clerk would have the floor for two heurs or more. Congressional veterans, who had spent a good share of their lives in the house ef representatives, cams into it for their final Bession, the recent tidal wave having retired most of .the leaders of the major ity. There were, however, few discon solntes among the defeated and they joined with the members of the minority in good natured sallies. Representative Holman, of Indiana, was one of the firet to appear and was greeted warmly by his friends. In the senate, the members were late in arriving, and seme of those most conspicuous in recent public events, notably Senator Hill, were absent. IN THE 

SENATE. Promptly at 12 o'oloek Vice ProBident Stevensou'cnlled the senate to order and Chaplain Milburn offored the opening prayer. He referred feelingly to the critical illness through which the daugh ter of the vice-president had safely pnssed. Harris (Dem. Tenn.) and Man derson (Rep. Neb.) wore appointed a coin uiittee to notify the presidout of the sen ato's readiness for his messnge. Mr. Cockrell (Dom. Mo.), chairman of tho committee on appropriations, offered a resolution which was adopted, providing that the daily sessions of the senate be gin at 12 o'clock noon. The roll call de veloped the presence of sixty-six sena tors, considerably more than a quorum. A recess was then taken until 12:30 p. m. 

BEFUBLIOAN SRNATOBS CONFER. At 12:30 the senate teok a further re cess until 1:30. On the Republican side, Mr. Wolcott of Colorado, who has been so prominently identified in tho fight for silver, conferred with Mr. Cameron of Pennsylvania. Aldrich and Allison, the respective tariff and appropriation authorities on the Re publican side, had a half hour's confer ence during the second recess, being joined by Messrs. Teller and Callam. On the reassembling of the senate at 1:30, Executive Clerk Pruden APPEABED WITH A MESSAGE from the president and Secretary Cox be gan the rending of the document. Special attention was given to the reference to the China-Japan war. This was the first official information known evcu to tho members of the foreign committee. It was much more brief than was expected and laft open the actual detail of the negotiations. AS 

BEEN TniiOUOH BKPUBLICAN GOGGLES The Republicans do not fear any tariff legislation this session. Senator Aldrich, of Rhode Island, says that he thinks it wonld be best to allow matters to rest where they ore. "Let the country re cover," ho added, "and wo will see if any further legislation is wanted." IN SFEAEEB CRISP'S DOMAIN. The house was called to order at noon. The chamber was well filled. Many of the members' desks were strewn with flowers. As onesaid: "These are flowers for the living and flowers for the dead." The desk of ex-Speaker Reed was adorned with an immense floral ship of state from a "Protectionist." On the desk of Representative Linton, of Michi gan, was a large floral Bohoel house, sent with the compliments of an A. P. A. organization, in acknowledgement of his championship of the publio schools. Mr. Reed was roundly oheered whon he en tered, as was Representative Wilson, ef West Virginia, author of the tariff bill. At 12 o'oloek, Speaker Crisp entered and ascended the rostrnm, and the second ses sion of the 63d oongress had begun. Rev. Mr. Bagby, the chaplain of the house, invoked divine blessing and then the roll was called. Abont 12:15 W. C. P. Breokinridge, of Kentucky, with ntB SNOW WHITI HAIB and beard, entered and walked quietly to his seat. A page, carrying an armful of magnificent roses, followed and placed them on his desk. The roll call developed the presence of 216 members, forty-seven more than a quorum. Wilson, Holman and Reed were appointed a oommittee to join a similar committee from the senate and inform the president that congress was ready to receive any communication he desired to make. At 12:30 the honse took a recess until 1 p. in. to await the president's message. At 1:35 Mr. Pruden, the president's exeoutive clerk, appeared with the mes sage, which was read by the clerk ef the house. THI
