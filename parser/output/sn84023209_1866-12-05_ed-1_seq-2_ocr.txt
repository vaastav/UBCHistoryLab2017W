The annual message of President Jolineon, given in full in this paper, "will he read 'with cons'derable interest ; although this interest has been mainly occasioned by the report?, indubtriout-ly circulated by some newspapers and corrr fp ndents, that the message would manifest a disposition on the part of the President to meet Cosgress half way in harmonizing the differences which Lave ex ited between the legislative end executive departments of the government for the past year. 1 be hopeful individuals who gave credence to these prophecies, and who were -ady to advise Conerefrt to meet the Presi- dei. t half-way in cider that there might be and amity between them, will peruse sage in vain in their search for the peact the met "cntence which indicates any change of pur r.

Joins-en's plan c has xxa wrong from the start , by areumirg it to l.aveleen righ H.t, that his reasoning respecting si.n of eeuatois and representatives 'gurate and Mib- force. He had no authority to mat the work of reorganization at the fcoutl his first proclamation, as well as every i emient step, wae unconstitutional and Meg. -Coi.gress is, tl.crelore, not bound to recog nize the governments which he has set in operation, i.or the elections held in any of the states reorganized under his proclama tions, e ha ing any validity. It is only by assuming that thtw; state governments have tie wnic aiitherity, and eh ctions held under t,m -ame validity, as the governments by . the cbeir . ooco In th a,UVw. and elections in the states which have never lost their organization, that the credentials of those claiming seats in CongTees from the rebellious states have any claims to be pre sented in Congress ; and this is the very point that the republicans, in Congress and out, contest on the threshold of the inquiry. The argument of the message is. therefore, a pe titio principii, and begs the very question at issue. Nor does it help the President's vi-w to quote resolutions passed in Congress in 161, or declarations of any official at any time during the rebellion ; for whatever they may mean "they are of no binding force upon the conscience cf anybody to-day. The resolu tions of Congress adop ed in July 1861, and set forth in this message, meant, if they mean" arjthir?, that slave-y should not be disturbed by the war ; yet slavery has been since aloIished in spite of them. This Congress i. not actim while frightened out of its wits uieni no Congress v t. r (j-jve Ic an-1 Dtct Lave id iliun itcttd by thedeleat at liull Kun. The nation got by that lone a2o.

W CO Ltt President JoLnsou puts in practice his dec laration, not jet two years rid, that Treason must c made odious and traitors punishea. it will be time enough for him to invite Con ot gress to redeem the pledges made by a for mer body , before the I orrible guilt of treason bad been lolly reveal d to the nation. The only rtmaining subjects in the mes sage upon which there had been much spec ulation, relate to Mexico and our relations witu r ranee, t p" mn, gixts us no facts which we were not in pos session of liforc. Certainly the message gives o adequate reason Tor the extraordinary step of sending Lt. Gen. Sherman to Mexico, although it hints at a possible difficulty with France. We trust CongTess will thoroughly ventilate the Mexican business, and will in - eist that our government shall keep fiee fr m an partieitation in the plunder of that peo ple. The Alabama claims and the Fenians are briifly alluded to, and the Fenians being a body of political consequence in this country, are -reated with great consideration. We .usmet it the black man was a otcr,he would have received much more deferential treat ment in this document.

But it beais tue strongest mu-riwi vid me of bcine the work ol some calmer and more finely cultivated mind than John eon's. Its tone ;s dignified, and its rhetoric worthy a state parer ; though its recommen dation that Congress admit members from the Southern States, that being, certainly in President Johnson's view of the duties of each House, not one of the " Measures'' whose "consideration" the Constitution makes it his duty to " recommend" to Con gressis in the worst taste, and in the high est degree impertinent.

In the Senate, Mr. Sumner attempted to call op the bill granting suffrage to the colored people of the District of Columbia, but it was decided that according to the rules, it could not be taken up until the sixth day of tbe session. The Senate should act upon it at the earliest possible mcment.

Few par ticulars are furnished, and the extent of the rebellion can only be inferred from the great military activity in England. It has created great excitueent among the Fenians in this country.1 'Whatever merciful views the English government ' had in Tespect to the treatment of blave-holdicg rebels, it is vigor ous enough when it fnda s rebel in the British Isl.nds.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. . . i Fellow Citizens of the Stna't and House of He resentatives : ! Aitcr a brief ir.tcrval lbs Congrccs of the Umtei S at resumes its annual legislative labors. An ail-wise ana mercllul rroviaenoe has abated the pestilence which visited cur shores, leaving is calamitous traces upon some portions of our country. Peace, order, tran quility, and civil au hority have been formally aVc!au-d 'o c x sr throughout the whole cf the ! United States. In all of the S ates civil ! authority has superseded the coercion of arms, and ttio pet-pie, by their voluntary action, are meiniiinirg their government in full activity and compltte operation. The enforcement ol the ls.ws le no loogcr " obstructed ia any etate by combinations too powerful to be sup pressed by tho ordinary rcursa ot judicial prece dings ;" und the animosities engendered oy the war are rapidly yielding to the beneficent iLtlujucfa of out free irstitutions, and to ike kindly effect's of unrestricted social n J commercial intercourre. An entire res coratioc ct fraternal feeling must be the oern est wish ot every patriotic heart j and we will have accomplished our grandeet na ional achievement, wbeji, forgetting the fud events ot the pass, and remembering only iheir instructive lessons, we resume our en ward carter as a free, pr.jpperoue, and urjt'cd ptoj ie.

The same recognition apptais in me recent legislation in reteronce to lennessee, which evidently rests uton tne iac& toa tun mnctions of the 8 ate were not aeairovea oy the rebellion, but merely suspended; and tbat principle is of course appiiciMo to taoae .tales which, like lennescee, attempted, to renounce their places in the Union , Tbe action ot tbe Executive Department ol the coveinment upon this subject has uedo taaalty defiuiteaod uniform, ana be purpue: ot the war was petuficall; stated in the Proo- lamatimv issued by my ptoaeoeas jr ou ura a.- Stntmbsr. 1862. . iv was inea sol- SBV.i nroclaimed ana declared tba; here atier.aaberetolore, the war wiU be probated Kr h objooi of prc.iOuy reasormu uw w- stituiional rclatioa between the Uuited Statss and each of the sat3 and faa ipla thereof, in which states that relation i or miy besus- pended or d:sturbed." The recognition of the states by the Judi- cial Department of the Government baa also been clear and conclusive ia all proceedings affecting them as state?, had in th-i Supreme, Circuit and District Courts. - In the admission of Smatois and Represen tatives from any aril ali of the states, there can bs no just ground of appfebectiian that peisons who are disloyal will ba clothed with tho powers of legislation; for this could not happen when the Cor-titution and tha laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithiul Con gress. Ech House is made the "judge ot tbe elections, returns and qualifications cf its own members," and may, " with tbe concur rer.oe ol two-thirds, expel a member.'' When a Senator or Representative presents his cer tificate of electiou, ha may at once be admit ted or rejected ; or should there ba any ques tion as to his eligibility, h a credentials may be referred lor investigation to the appropri ate committed.
