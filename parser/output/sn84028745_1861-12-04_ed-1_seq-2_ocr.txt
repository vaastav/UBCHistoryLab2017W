The Printers' Strike in Washington. Recently a portion journeyman printers of Washington "otruck" for the eight-hour system. They wanted their em ployers to pay them as much for eight hours of wotk as they had been receiving for ten hours. As Is well known, the Government has a large printing office in Washington, nril the foreman in that office acceded to the demands of the printers. But when h made out the bills and sent them for pay ment to the Controller, Mr. Whittlesey, he returned them unpaid, with a letter, con taining his reasons. These were, that while the men in the army and in the navy were worked night and day, and the clerka in the Departments many nights until ten o'clock, and while printers throughout the Union work at least ten hours, he did not see why those printers in the Government employ cculd ask full pay for a day of less than ten hours. Large Cargoes of Cotton Expected from the South. The achievements of our combined naval and land forces are not barren victories. They have solved the cotton question. Within a short time it is expected that large cargoes of cotton will arrive at New York. These arrivals will continue without inter mission. As our armies advance, the cotton already stored will be sent forward to mar ket, and the crops will be gathered and for warded without delay. There will be no occasion for manufacturers, foreign or do mestic, to desire the breaking of the block ade of Southern ports. The Union navy and army have opened the way to supply all the demand for this great staple, the pro ceeds of the sale of which will be applied to the payment of the expenses. The labor of the negroes will thus be made available, and until the cotton-growing communities in which the cotton is found return to their alle giance, the whole crop, as far as it may be taken possession of, will be appropriated by the Government to the public nse. Every lodgment made by our troops upon the South ern coatts from this time forth will add to the cotton supply, and at the same time strengthen the Government, and effectually remove every ground of complaint from the manufacturing districts of England and France. General Price's Call. The recent proclamation of the rebel Gen eral, Sterling Price, published on Monday, if cot a model of good English, at least proves that he is desperately in want of fifty thou sand men. Price is rather a rough stick, but, with leas means, he has done more than any other Confederate General. He is terribly in earnest; afflicted with the Secession epi demic mortally. He will hardly got over it. He is after his rights with furious energy. It is all labor lost, in our opinion. That fifty thousand will never come. He had as well call spirits from the vasty deep. They are not there, and wouldn't come if they were. From Charleston. The Philadelphia Inquirer publishes a private letter, dated Charleston, November 22, which it asserts is perfectly reliable. The writer Btates that several revolts hava taken place among the slaves in the inter ior, al though, so far as can be discovered, there bases yet been no attempt at an organized insurrection. Although the papers carefully avoid all reference to the subject, there is great nervousness among all classes lest there may be an extended outbreak at any moment, and some fear that this may be hastened by the very measures adopted to overawe the negroes, for those whose agency in revolts has been suspected bave, in several Instances, teen burned at the g'tikc Is He Found?

A Blundering Britisher. Bentley'i ilayaz'me one of the oldest English maga zines there is a sketch of the lives of six American notabilities, beginning with Presi dent Lincoln and ending with Nathaniel P Milks, luo writer ot trie sketches very modestly says that "if they have no other merit, they iiave at any rate that of correct Dfcfs." If the writer had said his sketches possessed the merit of novelty, he could not be accused or eiaircerauou. in tne eltetcn of President Lincoln we are informed that bis furefalherti lived in Pennsylvania and Virginia, and that Abiahum was born in Kentucky; be built Beveral flat-boats, sailed them down to New Orleans, and made a good 'thing out o'.' the business.

The writer goes on to say that in 1834 Mr. Lincoln was again a candidate for office, "and this time was elected to the Legislature of New Salem," very flourishing Stale, no doubt. The following acts in the life of t.ae President are new here, and there fore we cive them entire: "Tho Republican National Convention 1856 selected Colonel Fremont as candidate for tho Presidency, and the Republicans Illinois carried Lincoln s election as Vice President. But the fear of a dissolution the Union, which the Southern States threat ened, robbed the Republican party of a grout cumber ot votes in the Aortueru btates, an the election of Buchanan, a Democrat, was carried tnrougti. in June, loots, Liiucoin was put up by the Illinois Whigs as a candi date for the Presidency, while the Democrats worked for the election of Douglas. Both candidates made a tour through the State, end often appealed to the people at the same 'place and from the same platform. This struggle, in which Lincoln openly declared hiruselt opposed to slavery and the policy the Southern States, was carried on by both sides with great zeal and talent, and excited general interest. Douglas, however, eventu ally gained the day, while Lincoln had advantage that his Dame acquired great pop ularity for the future." Those who conteoded that Mr. Lincoln hod sot sufficient experience in affairs, be mortified to learn that the Whigs of Illi nois "carried his election as Vice President," and the friends of the late Senator Douglas must cot hereafter complain of the treatment their favorite rtceived, their candidate hav ing gained the day in his contest for Presidency in 1858 against Lincoln. The sketch of the other notabilities is just about as accurate as that of Mr. Lincoln. Dtmocrals will be grieved to learn, as they will from the writer in Bentletj, that in 1813 "Jeff.

As be makes a similar recommendation of provi sion for coast and lake defenses to that of Mr. Seward's circular to the Governors, there is room for hope that our relations with tbe great powers may yet be in as cheering a condition as was Btated in that circular, and that the provision recom mended for defenses is rather for prudent and peaceful preparation, than caused by any threatening aupect of onr foreign rela tions. The President, who is always argumenta tive, shows tbat domestic divisions are logi cally sure to bring a call for foreign inter ference; also, tbat foreign cations can not always resist the temptation, although inter ference usually brings moral retribution; he Btates, also, that the rebels bave received less foreign encouragement than they ex pected, and that if foreign nations have for gotten their moral obligations, they do not yet seem to see a snorter road to tne restor ation of commerce and cotton in the destruc tion than the preservation of the Union. But he says, if it may be believed that for eign nations have no higher principle than trade, then we still have in reserve a second atgument to show tbem that the way to trade is by aiding to crush the rebellion, in stead of giving it encouragement. t - : i..: . .

No treaties of grave political importance have been negotiated since the extra session. We bave failed to induce some of the foreign powers to adopt rules meliorating maritime war. We offered to accede to their treaty abolishing privateering. England and France declined, because we are at war. Tbey want privateering abolished when tbey are at war and we at peace. When the case is reversed their anxiety for meliorating ceases. The President advises an appropriation to indem nify a British vessel detained for a supposed breach of the blockade; also, the investment of tbe surplus Chinese fund to satisfy future claims tbat may arise against tbe Chinese. tie recommends that merchant vessels in the Eastern seas be authorized to carry on war against the pirates that infest those seas, and to matte captures. If there is any good reason for refusing to recognize the independence of Hayti and Liberia, tne f resident avers ne can not soe it. But as he does cot desire to introduce any novelties into the practice of the Govern ment, on his own responsibility, he leaves the matter to Uongress on a reccommeada tion of an appropriation for salaries of Charge d'ABaires to each of those States. Important commercial advantages might be secured by the usual commercial relations. Tbe trade of either of these countries is more valuable than that of Japan; that of Havti vastly more valuable than that of Japan ever can be to us. The people are slightly darker than the Japanese visitors, who so excited American enthusiasm, but probably much cleanlier and more intelligent; and accessary commercial and diplomatic relations can be established with them without such close social intimacy as that with which we culti vated our Japanese relations. The American Btomacb is tender on this subject; but not nice enough to refuse a good trade on ac count of color, either at home or abroad. negro s money will purchase the goods and tbe polite attentions of the most sweet scented white trader. We bave a considerable trade with Havtt. in spite of our nicety about diplomatic recog nition and commercial relations, we trade with them, while we affect to be too nice have their acquaintance. The result is, trade w carried on under disadvantages, and our people have not that protection against native insolence and injury tbat tuey might have by tbe usual arrangements, aud which be peop.e ot otoer countries nave in uayti. Our equeamishness only injures our own citizens, while it by no means stops inter course. If this cation is going to be par ticular about the complexion of its foreign commerce, it had better inclose itself in Chinese wall, to prevent tbe breezes from foreign lands, laden with mingled odors, fiom coming too near its nose. The rtesident lauds tne patriotism ot people in furnishing tbe means demanded tbe public exigencies, and acknowledges corresponding obligation of economy. says tbe expenses ot tne war are not the resources of the loyal people. Inasmuch as tbe war is carried on chieny by loans, which mast have a limit, it is, perhaps, sanguine to class them as resources. The patriotism of the people has furnished many more troops than Congress authorized. Congress having failed to provide Chaplains for tbe hospitals, the President supplies omission. He recommends additional grades in tbe navy service. The highest rank now Captain. The President has cot filled the vacancies on tbe Supreme Bench, because two of vacancies were for tbe States now in rebel lion, and, if appointed from those districts, tbe appointees could cot discharge duties. He states, however, that it would just to transfer one of them to the North, be baa not done it. Tbe reason why he has not filled the cancy caused by the death of Judge McLean, seems to be that the States are not all with Circuit Courts, and tbe Supreme Uourt or tne uircuit uourts snouid be modi fied; but it does not seem clear that an to this vacancy would prevent this modification any more than the incumbents. And as tbe North is entitled to one of the judges which the South had, there need be no hesitation in one of the Southern vacancies with a Northern man. To remedy such sectional icjuatice was what the people elected Administration tor. The President refers the matter of admin istering justice in the insurgent districts which may be occupied by our armies, Congress. Northern citizens holding against rebels have urged tbe Provost-Marshals to administer on the effects of the debtors. The President delines this, puts tbe matter unon Congress. The of courts of justice by military in California, during our military in the Mexican War, might a precedent for a plain and effective disposi tion of the affair, if the President wag posed to Improve it. He recommends making the adjudication of the Court of Claims final, without before Congress for revision and appro In tbe absence ol tnts tne uourt cas not in disposing ot claims any more than Congress did before establishment of this Court.

He suggests an agricultural and bureau, to foster agriculture by figures. - Our seal for the suppression of the trade at sea, bas corresponded with that tbe protection of tbe slave trade on land. viriue is not amphibious. It dies on One captain, who was purchasing and property In Africa, which has the a A to a the by the Ho est sanctity and extraordinary protection here, baa been sentenced to death for it. The President says that under the confis cation act, contrabands have come upon our hands; also, that some of the States may con fiscate slaves, and he advises that Congress receive them from the Btates on account of direct taxes due, then that tbey and such free negroes as desire it, be colonized on territory to be purchased for that purpose; and to that end be carefully argues the constitutionality of acquiring territory, which, considering our slight annexations heretofore, may be regarded as quite an un settled question. Inasmuch as tbe confiscation act only con fiscated tbe slaves of rebels who were actu ally UBed for military purposes, and as in the nature of things butfew who bave tbe requi site proof can come into our hands, es pecially when we exclude them indiscrimi nately from our lines, the number may possibly be disposed of on our own crowded territory, without making new purchases, in the present condition of the national purse; and in the present debilitated state of the Constitution, all extraordinary exertion of it is to be avoided if possible. The President says that in earrylng on the war to suppress the insurrection, he has been anxiouB and careful that it shall not degen erate into a violent and remorseless strug gle. He kept the integrity of the Union prominent as tbe first object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions not of Tital military importance to tne action ot tne Legislature. Battles are about the moat violent and remorseless struggles. War is carried on by violence. It aims to kill on tbe largest scale, and in tbe most remorse less manner. The ingenuity of mankind is strained to invent arms and projectiles to kill more numerously and remorselessly. Of course, the President does not mean that he has endeavored to carry on the war in such a way that nobody shall be hurt. He does cot mean tbat he has tried to avoid battles; and yet battles exasperate tbe contending armies to the highest pitch of rage. To save the integrity of the Union is not only the prominent object of the conteit on our part, but the whole object, aud as much the object of Congress as of the President. It includes every thing the suppression of tuo rebellion and tue complete esiaoiisurnent of the authority of the Government. If the President's war policy is adequate for that, there is very little to leave to the legislature. so far as the conduct of the war is concerned. Congress has appropriated men and money. and put them in his hands. The people have responded with troops more than he asked. They expect him, as Commander-in-Chief, to use these armies and means to prosecute the war in the most vigorous manner, in order to crush the rebellion, and they may feel disappointed when tbey are told that he has been careful that tbe war shall not degenerate into a remorseless revolutionary struggle, while it bas been a struggle of that charac ter from tbe first on the part of the rebels. and that be has endeavored to moderate it in order to keep the integrity of the Union prominent. In this connection the President stated that be ordered a blockade of rebel porta. inBtead of closing tbem as authorized bylaw, preferring to keep within the law instead of transcending. He states tbat he bas adhered to the confiscation act, and, "if a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered." A slight modification seems to have been made in our institutions, when Congress pro poses laws, and the President considers tbeir propriety. However, the President says further, the "tbe Union must be preserved, and bence all indispensible means must be eniplojed." This is the sentiment which General Jackson expressed more briefly. But, the President adds : "We should not be in baste to determine what radical and ex treme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as disloyal, are indispensible." This modifies the matter again. Tbe President indorses again hia inaugural address and his previous message, as con taining tbe whole duty of a President; and declares tbat. like the book of the Apoca lypse, nothing can be added to or subtracted from those documents. He reviews the re bellion record, and shows tbe progress tho Government has made in the regeneration of Maryland, tbe conversion ot Kentucky, tbe liberation of Western Virginia, and tbe res cue of Missouri, whl jh he says "is compara tively quiet," aud he believes "can not again be overrun by tbe insurgents." It is proba ble tbat this part of the message was written before the retreat from Springfield. Events have somewhat modified this comparative quiet of Missouri. He also shows that tbe cause of the Union has advanced southward to Port Royal. The President informs the country that Gen. Scott was in faver of appointing Geo. McClellan to tbe chief command, and the cation was unanimous on tbe subject, and he sustains tbe excellence of the appjiutment by a process of argument, ehowing that oue bad General is better than two good ones ; and then, giving way to the raling passion, be illustrates by almost an anecdote.
