The trusts are having a hard week of it, between the decision of the su i)fenie court on Monday, and the presi dent's message on Tuesday. The president speaks of China fls a.

The contention that Brigham H. Bob erts of Utah is not a citiziii of --ihe United States is'irrelevant and super fluous as compared with the fact that he is a law-breaker. There is still sufficient partisanship left in the country to make the presi dent's message strong and able to the republicans and ambiguous and vaecil ating to the democrats. In numbers the voters and bank de positors in -this country are about equal, and the total of depositors has doubled in ten years. The money pow er includes a good many people. Aguinaldo's belated desire to come under the protection of the United fetates may save his neck for him, but it won't be. as much to his political ad vantage as if it had occurred earlier^ Spanish-American revolutions, it is said, are carried on as business specula tions. The United States does not in tend that Cuba shall be a fresh field -.for mercenary organizers of civil war. As long as a bandit is left in Luzon somebody will pop up to exclaim that the "insurrection is not dead." If not defunct it is mightily scattered cora pared with what it was a few months ago.

Perhaps he is IpH figuring on taking the lecture plat Jfh/ foim this winter, A man with three ~0jfp wives surely needs some kind of steady «Sfe» work. A careful perusal of the president's message seems to indicate that he is ii, neutral with regard to China, the Brit ith-Boer war, the Sampson-Schley con troyersy, and the altercation between Chicago and St. Louis over the drain^ C'CV age canal. Q'~ The croakers have stopped croaking 3 about the terrible and wanton loss of J'-, life among United States troops in our recent wars, now that they have an opportunity, to contrast it with the losses by tlie British army in South .MjS' Africa. "Our flag has never waved over any tommunity but in blessing" is one of the epigrams in the .president's message that deserves to live. Nobody doubts that this sentiment was inspired by pa iriotism, but that style of Americanism is also mighty good politics. tef" In making the address at the dedica tion of the auditorium at Waco, Tex., Mr. Bryan talked for a solid hour on silver. Mr. Bryan always brings to, mind the story of the man wfia an nounced at a funeral that if nobody had anything to say about the corpse •would like to make a few remarks about the "per capiter" and the iniatlyc and referendum. a Secretary Gage, too, asks that the gold standard be expressed in the stat utes. As this is the position which is taken by the joint committee of both branches of congress as well as the president, the bill to carry that idea into effect which has already been in troduced will become a law. A ma jority of the republican members of both branches of congress is undoubt edly in favor of legislation on these lines, and, happily, the republicans control all branches of the govern ment. As to the South American republics, so-called, the: following, sick call' 1st sounded: Chili, on tlio verge of a fi nancial crisis Peru and Bolivia, torn by'revolutionfc Ecuador, preparing for a -resolution Colombia, civil war and .the "bubonic plague threatening all. hands.

Some votes were missigg-ifrom even the populists, and larger numbers were lacking from the republican and demo cratic total. This division would give the republicans '9. majority of 18 over all the other political ingredients in the house. The republican lead will be about half 'a dozen less than that, how ever.. But it will be long enough, with the use of the Reed rules, which have been adopted, to give' the republicans control of legislation in that chamber. If they take intelligent advantage of their opportunities a great deal of use ful work will -be done in the session which has just begun. The bones of John Paul Jones, America's first and greatest- naval hero, lie under a shed at No. 1 Rue des ICcluses Saint Martin, in the city of Pari^. It is proposed to bring the re mains to America, -that they may be buried with national honors At Arling ton. Members of congress in Washing ton have gone on record as favoring the project, and a concurrent resolution, instructing Ambassador Porter to pre pare for the removal by a warship, will be introduced by Representative Bing ham of Penns3'lvania in a few days. It is to be hoped that this resolution will be speedily acted upon. Americans are in the moojj to do honor to dead heroes as well as to the living, and cer tainly the memory of no dead naval commander is as sacred to the people as that of John Paul Jones. He ren dered services which deserve all possi ble public recognition. Less than the usual amount of fault has been found with the message of tlie president on account of its length, though it is one of the most volumin ous democrts that has ever come from the White House. The new questions treated of in the message alone, in a great degree, account for its pr.olixity, and it it is safe to say that it has been read by many persons who usually repudiate that style of literature, i'he country is growing so fast and its interests are multiplying to such an extent that it would be difficult to review its affairs within a limited space. Until the peo ple shall decide to elect as president a smart newspaper man who is a mas ter in the art of condensation and in giving the gist of things in a brief and direct manner, the two-column or three, column message, which so many Americans long to see, need not be ex pected. It will be observed that Secretary Long does not recommend any more torpedo boats or torpedo boat catch ers. The torpedo boat and the torpedo boat catcher were recently regarded as of tremendous importance. Just before the Spanish war a retired admiral of the United States navy expressed the opinion that the nation with the most torpedo boats was the most powerful at sea. France has held to this idea. So has Japan. An American officer of the name of Wainright knocked -the torpedo boat into the next thing to a cocked hat in showing what a fragile, ASM® ^S'"4S "ItfS •ffefts^yp lllfft helpless thing it was, after all. Yet the action between the yacht Corsair and the torpedo boats Pluton and Furor, off Santiago, did not.prove, that torp&do bonts could not blow up battle ships at night.

A well known Gerttian born American in Berlin recently made most ardent: os a German-American "to ob- tain an audience with the kaiser, hi refusing the request the. kaiser said: "Ich lsenne Amerikaner Idh kenne Deutsche aber Deutsche-Amerikanev Ich niclit." ("I know Americans 1 know Germans but I do not know' German-Americans.") The emperor was right. There can befino such thing as a man with two countries, He' dan belong to one and only one at'the same time. No doubt it -'inds Very fine to hyphenate the Word American with the name of one's fatherland, but it is not logical. If a man is an American, he is an American, of a witty way pf saying things. An just,as a German is a German, an Irish anecdote of him, showing his gre'at ad-j man is an Irishman, or an Englishman miration for Dewey, is related by the Ladies' Home Journal, as follows: Soon after Ms return from the Phil ippines Captain' Cdghlan was in Wash ington and fell in with a party (of 'friend.s who were discussing the admir al's valor. One of them said: "We have heard a great deal of Dewey's courage and ability over here. Do we place him too high?" "How high do you place him Coghlan asked. "Well, :we put him up very high." "Put him up higher," said Cdfehlan." A aa Englishman. A true citizen can no more be faithful1 to two countries than a true'Christian-can worship two gods.: And all this, it Will be seen, does not in the least preclude a man's loving as sincerely as he can his fatherland. It only says that if a man is an Ameri can his fatherland will come second in his affections. If it comes first then the man is not an American. THE MANDATE OF THE PEOPLE. The failure of Brigham H.

While much has been said in opposi tion to an increase in the army, it is significant that little or nothing has been said against the great increase in the power of- the United States navy. Secretary Loqg recommends substan tial enlargement of this branch of the service, the president urges congress to act upon these recommendations, and there is every reason t& believe *4ha£ the people at large-will'concur. The recommendations are, first, to at once provide armor plate for the battle ships now being 1)11111 or authorized, and, second, to authorize three 13,000 ton armored cruisers aqd twelve gun boats. This will seem reasonable to the majority of the people, regardless of narty. Recommendations for a much larger addition to the navy would irobably meet with public approval, 'he nation, let it be noted, has always favored a powerful navy. In the days before the new navy was begun the public constantly clamored against the policy of keeping in repair obsolete vessels. United States warships were called old tubs and became a standing national joke. With feverish interest the people read all that could be tpld about the new ships, and a great na tion -was almost childish over the small white cruisers that were the first of the new navy. The first White Squadron" was celebrated in verse and story. Plays and operas were written around the popular "White Squadron." Was not this the expres sion of the interest of the nation? Why did the people want a great navy? The answer is that it was the instinctive yearning of the nation for preparations to do exactly what was done at Manila and Santiago. It was expansion in the heart of the American people. 

PRAYERS WITHOUT PREJUDICE. The most exhilarating Thanksgiver that has been brought to public notice this year is Mr. Ervin* Winslow, of Boston, who Bpent his Thanksgiving day praying for the repentance of the "blood-guilty usurper" who has "given —merica its first Thanksgiving of shame." These words are suinosed to apply pointedly to President McKinley and it is perhaps superfluous to add that Mr. Winslow has still some reason tj be glad that he lives in a free'coun try. Had he been in Germany -born and prayed thus, he would have been languishing in jail ere this on a charge of lese majeste. That is, he would un less he had confined his petitions strict ly to the confines of his closet, and even in that case it is not.Impossible that certain stray utterances might have been deflected in their course and Reached the ear of the emperor instead of the Almighty. What is more espec ially interesting, however, in Mr. Wins low's case, is that he is nobly deter mined to Buffer alone whatever conse quences his temerity rofiy ..call. down.

Des Moines News: Congress can do only one thing in the Roberts case. It can expel the man who has violated the laws of the land. Congress has nothing to do with Rob erts' belief or his conscience. In this country a man is permitted to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, providing he does not violate the law. The dictates of Rob erts' conscience lead him to believe that polygamy is ordered of God. That belief is between him and his God. But he must not carry his belief "into practice, because to do so is to become a law-breaker.' It may seem harsh to punish a man fpr following his con science but the punishment in this instance is not of the kind that courts impo'se. Roberts is to be deprived of the privilege of a law-breaker to make laws. And such a privilege no law breaker may ask. Roberts is an open boastful violator of the statutes of the land. The people who selected him broke the law, and Roberts is their representative. Let tlie people of Utah learn that laws are not made to be broken with impunity. fr-,% Faltb Will be Kept.

Des Moines News: Mr. Chamberlain is occupying more space on the stage than he deserves. All his talk about an Anglo-American alliance is bun combe. There can 'be no alliance that amounts to anything except by treaty, and no treaty made by this country is valid until the senate of the United ,nm i4. States has confirmed it. Our methods of government are open board and our diplomacy knows notb ing of secret treaties. There may be some sort of an under standing between Mr. Chamberlain and certain members of the administration, but these members speak only for themselves. This is a government of the people, and the people by their! pathos of Mr. Winslow's modest and: representatives in the senate do the timely act. President McKinley is used to being prayed for. He gets more or less .of it in all the churches of the country every Sundav, and we have no doubt that he heartily appre ciates the fact. Inasjpuch.as Mr. Win slow's prayers were avowedly for the good of tlie president's soul, we do not suppose he can repudiate them.

OLKO !QAN. Iowana Evidently Dlalllte Immltatlon Batter. Des Moines, Dec. 1—Evidently the Io wac is no hand for oleomargarine, even in times when real butter is exceeding ly high. According to an advance sheet of the dairy commissioners' thir teenth annual report, soon to be issued, there is but one retailer of oleomarga rine in Iowa. As is well known, those who sell the preparation must deal it out from receptacles so marked in large letters, and placards on the wall in bold faced type must tell the Btory again. Most of the stuff is purer than some butter that is sold in tbe market, for it is made of beef suet and other harmless ingredients and not from stale lard, as is generally believed. It will retail at 10 cents per pQund, when real butter is selling beside it at 30 cents. The report contains some valuable in formation In regard to Iowa dairy in terests, which is reproduced below, the first item 'being for 1898 for compari son and the second the showing for 1899, period ending September 30: Number of creameries that Pasteur ize skimmed milk, 0, no report for '98, Number of retailers of oleomargar ine, 1.

Ipp •iffi HIS SICK WIFE. m&:mm The Facta Aa to Anderaon'a Vote mac Gear. Indianola, Dec. 6.—The people who have seen the article recently publish ed in the Register, are laughing at its statement that J. M. Anderson, repre sentative-elect from this county, is in Colorado "for the benefit of his-wife's health." Mr. Anderson's wife has been dead for three years. Eqiially amusing is the denial of the Register that Mr. Anderson will vote for Gear. Everybody here knows that Mr. Anderson wrote to Mr. Cummins some weeks ago that he could not sup port him. Some of Mr. Cummins' words in reply to this letter could be quoted, if necessary. Fully 90 per cent of the republicans of this district are for Gear and Mr. Anderson would not dare to vote for Mr. Cummins even if he wanted to do so. It would be as much as his political life is worth. 4 The Five-Mile Limit.

Judge Kinne Delivers an Address Before Sheriff's Association. 1 KEPT BUSY CONVICTS MOST BE The Necessity for Tills Thorongbly Re* viewed—Element of Competition With the Free Laborer Also Thoroughly JDIscnssel* Des Moines, Dec. 8.—At a convention of county sheriffs held in (his city Judge Kinne, of the board of control, delivered an address upon convict la- bor After reciting th repe ated leg- islation bearing upon the subject the judge presented a" long argument, in which he discussed the following three propositions: First, the propriety of requiring convicts to labor second, competition of such labor, and third, what is the best system of employing the labor of convicts? Few persons will now be found to the should read the constitution of the Jn idleness. "Even those who most United States and know something of loudly protest against the employment our way of doing things. convicts in certain industries, said There are those who will -wish that the maintenance of convicts speaker, "are always ready with suggestions as to how they may be em ployed in ways in which they insist the product of their labor will not compete in the open market with free labor. From an economic standpoint no one can successfully argue in favor of enforced idleness for these people. Why should the criminal who must be legally restrained be kept in idleness? Why should the tax payer support con victs while they do nothing? Why, even, should the laboring man be de luded with the idea that he is benefit ed by securing legislation to prevent the convict from being a producer,ar.d thereby add to his already heavy bur dens by increasing taxation? Such legislation would result in requiring diligent, honest laboring men to assist in supporting the less diligent and the criminal in idleness. Many laboring men have very incorrect opinions touching this question. These opin ions, I am sorry to say, are fanned into convictions by scheming politicians. "Although a man is confined for a crime, still the state has no moral right to so confine him as to unneces sarily injure his health. It is well known that confinement in idleness tends to unsettle the mind, and in many cases leads to insanity. "Hence, from the standpoint of good morals, economics and public policy, all convicts able to do so should be re quired to labor during their period of confinement." On competition the judge said: "The chief argument adduced against convict labor, whether on the contract or piece price plan,is that it- enters into competition With free labor. It is an easy matter to demonstrate from sta tistics which every one will concede reliable, that such argument is not based upon the facts. "Hon. Carroll D. Wright, United States commissioner of labor" (see North American Review of March, 1897), says: 'That-free workmen pro duce nearly three times as much per day as the convict on a general aver age, and that the total value of labor expended by co'nvicts in the peniten tiaries and prisons of like grade at the present time does not much exceed $2,500,000, or a little more than one tenth of 1 per cent of the total wages paid in the manufacturing industries in the country in 1890. Thus it may be seen that whether the state treasu ry be considered, or the competition with free labor taken into account, the prison labor question from a purely eoonomic point of view need not excite much attention. I have found few in stances where prices have been affect ed in the least, and never a case where wages have been lowered in conse quence of the employment of convicts on productive industries. It is an ab solute impossibility to prevent compe tition if convicts are to be employed in any way whatever. It must be admit ted by all sane men that they should be employed and constantly employed upon intelligent labor." Regarding the underselling of pris on products, Otis Fuller states: "I am satisfied that more free manufactur ers will be found underselling the pris ons than there are prisons underselling the free factories. That is certainly true in Michigan. Last winter certain manufacturers of furniture claimed that their business was being seriously injured by convict competition in Ionia prison, and they asked the legislature to abolish our furniture factory. I in sisted that it was not doing, so. I charged that nine Michigan factories, making the same grade of goods as those made in Ionia prison were cut ting from 50 cents to $1.50 below the prison prices for the same grade of goods. I invited them to produce their cash and invoice books. The legisla ture. said: 'This is a fair offer, gen tlemen show us your books.' Not one produced their books, and the vote iVas 49 to 29 in favor of allowing the state an opportunity to employ its convicts in productive labor.'" Warden Chamberlain, of the Jack son, Mich., prison, says: "I am satis fied that this charge in relation to con vict labor cominginto competition with free labor Is greatly overestimated. In the state of Michigan, in the year 189S, the report of the commissioner of la bor shows that the 190,000 operatives of free latjor produced manufactured goods that amounted to $237,000,000. In the four prisons, including the De troit house ''of correction, with 2,000 prisoners employed, the total output was $650,000. When we come to com pare this $650,000 earned by the 2,100 prisoners in competition with the 190, 000 operatives in the different indus tries of free labor, who produce $237, 000,000, you can readily understand how small the competition is." In speaking of the statement of Hon. Carroll D. Wright, Warden Wolf er, latfe of the prison at Stillwater, Minn., says: "The competition of convict labor is not so serious a ques tion after all. It is claimed that there are about 80,000 prisoners now confined in the prisons of the United States. Divide this number by three and we reduce the quantitative effect of con vict labor competition to an almost in ,finitesimal degree. Convict labor, then **Strike For Your Attars and Your Fires." Patriotism is always com mendable, but in every breast there should be not only the desire to be a good citizen, but to be strong, able, bodied and well fitted for the battle of life. To do this, pure blood is absolutely neces sary, and Hood's Sarsapa rilla is the one specific which cleanses the blood thorough ly. It acts equally well for both sexes and all ages..

Hood's rlll» care llrer 111a the non-Irritating an« "qnly cathartic to Ulto with Hood't a»r»»p»rUla. does not compete with free labor to any appreciable degree." Those objecting to prison labor on the ground of competition suggest the following as proper work for prisoners which will not compete with them, viz: (1) Breaking stone and building highways (2) farming (3) building public works (4) employing convicts at making articles for other state in stitutions. But first is the one of the suggested employments that will not compete with free labor. If the convict builds the highways, he takes just so much work from some one else. If he does farm work, he is entering into compe tition with the farmer. If he builds public works, he does that which free labor might, and thus deprives such la bor of so much work. If he manufac tures articles for other state institu tions he is- supplying articles which free labor might furnish, and thus competing with it. You may search the whole range of vocations and occu pations, varied and numerous as they are, and not one can be found for the convict to work at where his labor will not compete with all others employed in like labor. Not only will the convict, if he la given any labor, always compete with free labor, but the four things suggest ed for his employment as freest from competition are all objectionable. Road making would be very expensive to the state in watching the prisoners and moving them from place to place. There are only thirteen counties in the state which have sufficient stone to make roads. The roads are local af fairs there would be no work in win ter, and what community of farmers, for instance, would enjoy having a col ony of convicts in the neighborhood And after all, the working of convicts on the roads would revive the chain gang, and the employment- of guards armed with rifles possrWy-ttfc_a4dl tion of bloodhounds. Would free bor want to compete with a centraliz ed form of convict labor on publio works? And in any event, what public works has Iowa or the cities of Iowa on which convicts could be engaged? And would not the objections that are brought forward against the chain gang and the armed guards. in road making work apply to public works 1 Convicts employed at farming would compete with the labor of the farmer, certainly and where would' the state acquire enough land to furnish em ployment to 1,000 convicts, and how could it- employ enough guards td watch them and keep them from es caping? If a convict makes goods foi the other state institutions, certainly, he is competing with the labor of th free man who is employed in making the goods the institutions would oth erwise buy. There is no getting away from this competition business, so far as it goes. If the convict works he will compete with free labor, but as a mat ter of fact the competition amounts to nothing. If we will eliminate from this ques tion of conivct labor all political con siderations, and treat it as we would any other business proposition, its so lution is easy. Experience has taught that: First—Letting labor of convicts by contract or on the piece price plan se cures more revenue to the state than any other plan. Second—That it requires a smaller investment by the state than under any other plan. Third—That it requires less high salaried officers. Fourth—That the convicts, are as well cared for under this-as under any other system. Fifth—That under it the risks al ways incident to the conduct of large manufacturing enterprises are avoided. If I have succeeded in interesting you, gentlemen, and other thoughtful •men, so that you will thoroughly in vestigate, I have no doubt that you will agree with me that as the state has for about sixty years, (reaching back even to the time it was a territo ry) recognized and followed the pres ent system, and as it has worked well, it would be poor policy to qow enter upon a scheme of limitation as to pris on labor and its products, whereby the expense of supporting our penitentia ries to be borne by the people of the state will be enormously increased, with no resulting corresponding bene fit. .... 1 Jdabry Ha* a Son.
