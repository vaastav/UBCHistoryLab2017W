The popular idea expressed in the phrase, «the art of self-defense,” shows the opinion that the chief enemies a man has to defend himself from are visible and external. But the real danger of every man is from minute and often in visible foes. In the air we breathe and the water we drink are countless minute organisms leagued against the health of the body. The one defense against these enemies is to keep the blood pure. Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery thoroughly purifies the blood, removing poisonous substances and accretions. When the blood is pure there is no harborage for *the germs of disease which find a lodg ing only when the blood is impure and corrupt. "I consider yonr ‘ Golden Medical Discovery ’ one of the best medicines on the face of the earth,” writes Mr. Wm. Fleeter, of Redoak, Montgomery Co.. lowa. "While in the south west, three years ago, I got poisoned with poi son ivy. The poison settled in my blood, and the horrors I suffered cannot be told in words. I thought I would go crazv. 1 tried different kinds of medicine, tried different doctors, but all the relief they could give me was to make my pocket-book lighter. I then began taking Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. Took four bottles without relief. Kept taking it. I took in all ten botUes and got entirely cured.” Dr. Pierce’s Pleasant Pellets cure con •tipation. The Light of the World } OR — Our Saviour in Art, Cost nearly SIOO,OOO to produce.

Puget Sound's Dry Dock to be of Great Future Importance. “It requires only ordinary intelli gence together with a little study to convince one that the North Pacific coast is a region destined Ho play an important part in the history of the United States and therefore of the world,” said Admiral Bradford to the Seattle Post Intelligencer after he re turned from a visit of inspection to the Bremerton naval station. “There is but one good harbor on the Pacific coast in American territory aud that is Puget t-ound, If you travel thence southward you will have to go clear to Mexico to find a harbor which, like Puget sound, is safe and reliable at all seasons of the year, at all stages of the tide during all kinds of weather. “The dangers to navigation at the entrance to the bay of San Francisco are well known to nautical men. So also are the dangers at the mouth of the Columbia riyer. Battleships of the larger kind have no access either to Portland or the government drydock at Mare Island. We can get into Port Ochard in all kinds of weather. In this respect alone -the Bremerton naval station is entitled to and should receive the most favorable considera tion by congress. “The borders of every country are usually cared for. Puget sound is ad jacent to the border between the United States and Canada. The naval station at Bremerton is far enough re moved from the houndry line to make it safe for the repair and equipment of vessels of the United States navy even in time of war. Because of the depth of water, the shelter from storms and easy access from the ocean the Puget Sound naval station has paramount advantages. “The Bremerton dock was located after a thorough investigation b} r two official boards composed of men of the very highest knowledge and qualifica tion. There is no question as to changing the location of this govern ment drydock. There was a question a short time ago, but I believe that all danger to the Bremerton station has passed away. Therefore the energy of the.navy department should in my opinion, be directed to making the station as efficient and serviceable as possible, It should be developed to its very lightest capacity in my opinion. To do this will require the expenditure of a large sum of mone} - , which under the circumstances the government can well afford to make in my opinion. “What the naval station at Bremer ton needs is development. That is all there is to the problem. It needs more machine shops and better facilities for the repair and equipment of war vessels. This is only a question of money, I have recommended the establishment of a coal storage plant, with room for 26,000 tons of coal. The location of the Puget sound dry dock makes it possible for the govern ment to secure the best coal in the world for the use of warships. “They are now digging the founda tion for a big building at Bremerton which will contain machinery for the repair and equipment of war vessels would do more than this. I would have facilities at the Puget sound dock for the storage of all the neceesaiy amumtioiiS of war. The government should provide for the outbreak of hostilities at any moment. When the moment arrives all that should be necessary in my opinion would be to fight. The Puget sound station can easily be made fit for the care and equipment of the largest American battleship. As I said before, all it re quires is money, and because of its magnificent location, its proximity to the international boundary line and its splendid harbor the Puget sound station should be developed to the very highest stage of efficiency. “There is no perfect harbor on the Pacific coast, in American territory, save Puget sound. In other words, you can enter no port save Puget sound on the Pacific coast in all stages of the tide and all kinds of weather. There is a bar at San Francisco which is dangerous to cross during adverse winds and tides. The Columbia river has dangers which every mariner well understands. Just now the Port Or chard dock is the only government dock on the Pacific coast which is ca pable of receiving the largest battle ships. The government is building a new dock of large capacity at Mare Island, Cal., but pilots*say that it is out of the question to attempt to bring tbe large war vessels from Ban Fran cisco to Mare Island because of the low waU>r. They are dredging a channel now. Will it be permanent? Ido not know.” CABTOZIZA« Bears the y»Tlie tM Y« tfaw Mwfrßugtt royal srs, T pdre Makes the food more delicious and wholesome BOY At BAKtNO POWP6R CO., NEW YORK.. Washington Letter. IProm our regular Correspondent.! Washington D. C., Dec. 2d, 1900 Senators Allison, Hanna, Spooner, Hale, McMillan, Elkins, and Wolcott, each a man of wide experience in both business and politics, compose the steering committee that will arrange and direct the republican legislative programme in the Senate, which must be arranged with much more care than that for the House, where an or der from the committee on rules can, at any time, limit the debate and seta time for voting on a measure. With such pilots in charge, there is no pro bability-hardly a possibility-that any mistakes will be made in the Senate end at this session of Congress. The Nicaragua Canal Bill, which passed the House at the last session is already provided for, the Senate having agreed that it should be taken up Dec. 10 and given the right of way until dis posed of. Which of the more import ant bills will follow will be decided by the steering committee, but the deci sion will depend to an extent upon which gets through the House first. Although the shipping hill is already upon the Senate calendar, and the sev eral propositions for an array reorgan ization hill were carefully gone over by the Senate Military Committee at the last session, it is likely that the House will be given an opportunity to pass both before they are brought be fore the Senate. It is the expressed intention of the republican leaders of the House to pass the army bill and the shipping bill be fore the holiday recess, although one or both may be referred to a caucus first. Chairman Hull, of the House Military Committee, has been in Washington nearly a week conferring with the President, War Department officials and army officers on the de tails of the army bill, upon which his committee will get to work this week, in order that it may be reported to the House at the earliest possible mom ent. V Representatives Payne. Dalzell and Hopkins, acting as a sub-committee of the House of Ways and Means Committee, have completed the first draft of a bill to reduce inteinal rev enue taxation. The bill will not be made public until approved by the committee, and possibly not until it is reported by the House, which will be during the first week of the session, but it is practically known that it deals almost exclusively with the stamp taxes which have proven a source of worry and inconvenience, al though cheerfully paid by the public because it was known that the money was needed by the government, and that it does hot touch the tax on beer or on any kind of tobacco. The beer and tobacco interests have already be gun to howl, but the committee will probably stand by the work of the sub committee. In accordance with the advise of Secretary Gage, the aggregate reductions made by the bill, will be inside of $30,000,000 a year. President McKinley and Secretary Hay added another to the several dip lomatic triumphs they have scored for the U. 8, in connection with the Chinese troubles when they took the initiative in breaking the deadlock in to which the foreign ministers at Pe kin have gotten themselves, by sug gesting to the other powers that the negotiations be taken out of the nauds of the foreign ministers and that an international commission be assemb led outside of China, preferably at The Hague, for the purpose agreeing upon the demands that the powers sbal make upon China. Favorable replies have already been received from sev eral of the powers and it is considered probable that the suggestion will be acted upon. It is not the idea of the President that there should be any negotiations with China at all, but that the international Commission shall determine what demands it would be lair and reasonable to make upon China, and that China shall then be notified to ccmply with them. He be lieves that something between the punishment the Chinese government wishes to administer to those who in stigated the Boxer troubles and the wholesale beheading of prominent men demanded by some of the powers will be about right, and that the money idemnity shall be fixed at a figure that China can pay, rather than at the im possible amount named by Germany. j The preliminary report of the Isth mian Canal Commission is in the bands of President McKinley, and, as expected, is strongly in favor of the Nicaragua route, which will 1»e many millions cheaper than the Panama route. This.makes it practically cer tain that the President will, in his annual message to Congress recom mend the necessary legislation for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal. How to Cure Croup. Mr R Gray, who lives near Ainenia, Duchess Co., N, Y., says: “Chamber lain’s Cough Remedy is the best medi cine I have ever used. It is a line children's remedy for croup and it never fails to cure.” v When given as soon as the child becomes hoarse, or even after the croupy cough has devel oped, is will prevent the attack- This should be borne in mind and a bottle of the Cough Remedy kept at hand ready for instant use as soon as these' symptoms appear, at C. V. Dunbar’s From Hickory Ridge Missouri. Floored! Swatted on the gob! Knocked out in the second round! McKinley and the dinner pail got there! Gosh ! Didn’t they paste it to us ever lastingly ! Twasn’t our fault, though- Hickory Ridge done noble. Bryan said he was bound to win, and we bet on his judgment. And it cost us the best squirrel dog in the whole stale by jacket! As we go to press the news is that everything has gone republican except h 1 and Texas. For president in 1904. Andrew Jackson of Tennessee. We’ve got to get back to the old landmarks or we’re wiped out. - We acknowledge a serenade by the republican marching club with a brass band last night. It was darned poor music,but we suppose it was the best they could do, Thanks. We are in lavor of reorganizing the democratic party or abolishing the whole shooting match. When it’s got so that we haven’t any principles of our own and have to take them second handed from a ’lot of Kansas and Nebrasda cranks and grandaddy longlegs with yeller hair and their pants in their boots, who don’t know anything but free silver and calamity hooting, its time, by jingo, to call a new deal! We’re tired of holding the sack for the republican snipe hunters. It’s going to be a blamed long cold winter for us this year. Wood, coal and corncobs wanted on subscription, and wanted right now! Just Saved His Life. It was a thrilling escape that Chas Davis of Bowerston, 0., lately had from a frightful death. For two years a severe lung trouble constantly grew worse until it seemed he must die of Consumption. Then he began to use Dr. King’s New Discovery and lately wrote: “It gave instant relief and ef fected a permanent cure.” Such won derful cures have for 25 years, proven it’s powers to cure all Throat, Chest and Lung troubles.

An .exercise in pronunciation was placed on the blackboard at a teachers institute, a prize being offered to any one who could read and pronounce every word correctly. The book offer ed as a prize was not carried off, how ever, as twelve was the lowest number of mistakes in the pronunciation made The exercise was as follows: “A sacreligious son of Belial, who suffered from bronchitis, having ex« hausted his finances, in order to make good the deficit, resolved to ally him self to a comely, lenient and docile young lady of the Malay or Causasian race. He accordingly purchased a calliope and,coral necklace of a cha meleon hue and secured a suite of rooms at a principal hotel, he engaged the head waiter as his coadjutor. He then dispatched a letter of the mos‘t unexceptional caligraphy extant, in viting the young lady to a matinee. She revolted at the idea, refused to consider herself sacrificable to his de sires, and sent a polite note of refusal, on receiving which he procured a car bine and bowie knife, said that he would pot now forge fetters ‘hymeneal with the queen ,«yvent to an isolated spot, severed his jugular vein and dischar ged the contents of the carbine into his abdomen. The debris was removed by the coroner." NO 61.
