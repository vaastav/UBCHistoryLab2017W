A Few Imhm why Bayard'* Bourn will net Boom. From the St. Paul's (MUn.) Ploreer Press. Mr. Bayard is said to he discouraged by the perverse behavior of his boom. He came hack from Europe just in the nick of time. The destroyer bad been at work among hie rivals, east and west. Thurman had just been slain in Ohio and Tildeu in New York. The Democracy, stunned and blinded by ac cumulated catastrophes was groping about among the wounded of lost bat tle-flelds for somebody with life enough in him to lead it to new defeats. The party was even reduced to euoli desperate straits that it explored the graves left by many former disasters and proposed to dig the hones of Hora tio Seymour from the quiet nook where they have rested since 1868, to wire and galvanize them into the ghastly semblance of a leader in the contest of 1880. Just at this juncture, cams Bay ard. He had shrewdly kept out of bat tle and escaped disaster ; had shelter ed himself in Europe and kept himself as much alive as his usual habit is. What more natural lhau that the De mocracy should hail him as the eagerly sought leader. But it didn't. It Is true some sort of a reception was pre pared for him in New York ; hut aB he earns sailing into the harbor, hie delicate nostrils detected an odor of Tammany about it, and he declined to commit his boom to the doubtful care of John Kelly. It was Hobson's choice, ami- as he wouldn't have a Tammany reception he got none. As the next host thing, he went home to Delaware aud got himself ihterviewed in correct and etately platitudeB of ex cellent English and admirable senti ment, which were telegraphed over the country without regard to expense. All the same, hie boom Wouldn't boom. This is the more disappointing, as Mr. Bayaril permits himself to be dis turbed by no shadow of a doubt that he is the purest and ablest statesman in the Democratic party. And, with a certain qualification, to be noted later, be is correct in his conviction. All tillage considered, Mr. Btyardls proba bly the best of the Democratic states men. Why, then, doen't his acknowl edged virtue help his adolescent boom ? It is no satisfactory answer to say that he is too good for his party. If he were so excessively virtuous as to repel the evil element of his .party, the good element would cling to him and, what is more important to hie success, he would attract the fastidious floating vote that is what makes presidents these days. But Mr. Bayard does not attract the virtuous aud repel the evil elements in his party, but the reverse. He is welcomed by Tammany, while the virtuous Democrats aud fastidious independent voters are indifferent to him. The reason for this aud the failure of Mr. Bayard to inspire enthusiasm as a Presidential candidate, reste in the pe culiar quality of his virtue ; the char acteristic texture of his personality.— His gooduess is of the goody-good kind; of a pulpy, negative, inoffensive tex ture, that does not iiifiueuce others or communicate itself to his following. Mr. Bayard is not a weak man, bat he is a weak leader; or rather he is no leader at all. He has strong personal convictions, and he can resist invasion of bis personal rights ; but he cannot impress his conviction upon others, or lay down a line of policy and bring his party associates to fallow it. Ue can reiuse to follow his party and sulk alone by himself in a corner ; bat he cannot lead. Daring all his history he has been doing one or two things, fol lowing obediently in the line of policy marked out by lees conscientious but more vigorous partisans, or standing aside silent, powerless and alone, while his party moved on without him. No man had ever better command of Iris own convictions or less influence with his martyrs than Mr. Bayard. Whenever he has acted with hie par ty, he has surrendered his personality and lias been a partisan of the parti sans. Whenever he has separated from Iris party in obedience to his per sonal convictions, he baa carried no body with him. He separated from his party on the financial issue, it ie true, but the party of honest money gained only his eingle vote. He has acted with hie party a hundred times, without moderating the intemperative ness of its partisanship a particle. He has served on par'isan investigating committees, and the influence of his less able but more emphatic associates has tinctured his reports with the blindest injustice. He has acted iu Democratic caucus, when the impet uous z-al uf his associates has swept him from his conservative footing and curried him into most radical excesses. lu the extra session last spring, he surrendered to the madmen who forced the conflict with the executive ae weak )y as he resisted the fiat money men boldly the winter before. Mr. llayard always surrenders to the extremists on political questions. This is the reason why the bad men, the unscrupulous partisans of theDem oorany, do not fear that the political virtne of Mr. Bayard would haDg like a millstone about the neck of their schemes of partisanship and plunder. They understand that it is a parade ground virtue, a campaign catchword, that would never he permitted to inter fere with party Bucoees. They under stand that Mr. Bayard as President would be like Mr. Bayard as Senator, pi-raoually pure and Incorruptible by money ; but the servant of his party aud the tool of more impetuous leaders; strong enough at most only to keep himself from entering upon a rash and dangerous course—never to restrain his party as well. This is why Tam many is willing to boom for Bayard. And this is why the independent voter doea not inoline to Bayard and his boom languishes. The independent voter sees that to elect Bayard would be eimply to vote the Democratic party into power, with all that the word im plies ; and he considers that the gilded image of a saint for a figure-head is email consolation for a ship fallen into the hands of a piratical crew. Mr. Bayard was in error not to accept Tam many's reception. If he is nominated for the Presidency, it will be for parti ■an considerations, not for hti virtues. THE rOKTY.BIXTH C'OHUKEM. The Opening »r lb* Ke«»i\i Yes lerday-Boadlagoribe Hostage— Nonalor Chandler's Deatb An uoanced. SKKATI. The Senate was called to order at 12 o'clock by Vice-President Wheeler,and prayer was offered by the Chaplain, who made special allusion to the deatb of one Senator and the severe domestic affliction of another lines the close of the last session. Ou motion of Mr. Thurman, of Ohio, the Secretary was directed to inform the house that the Senate was in ses sion, and on motion of Mr. Bayard, oi Delaware,Messrs.

M. the Senate Committee to wait ou the President reported that they had done so,and had been inform ed that the President would at once communicate to Congress a Message in writing. Immediately after the committee had reported, the Private Secretary of the President appeared and announced that Ue had been directed to deliver to the Senate a Message from the President. The Message was thereupon received and submitted by the Vice-President. The Clerk then began to read the Mes sage. The reading was concluded at 3.10 P. M. SKNATOR C1IANDLBlt'S IIKATH. Mr. Ferry, of Michigan, then rose and said that the sorrowful official duty de volved upon him of announcing to the Senate the death of his late colleague, Xachariah Chandler. It was nut his preseut purpose to speak of the char acter and serviqps of one so long aud so notably a member of this body, but at some suitable time he would invite the Senate to express, by resolution and by eulogy, its senes of the irreparable loss the nation had sustained iu the death of so distinguished a citizen. As a mark of respect to a Senator present at the last adjournment and absent now forevermore, he moved that the Senate adjourn. The motion was agreed to and at 3.15 p. in., the Senate adjourned until 12 o'olock to-day. . HOUSE. Long before the hour appointed for the meeting, the galleries of the House filled with interested spectators, while on tlie floor the scenes inci dent to the first day of a Bessiou were being enacted until Speaker Ran dall, ascended to bis desk which was adorned with a handsome basket of flowers, and called the House to order. l'rayer was offered by the Chaplain, the Rev. Dr. Harrison, who returned thanks that the members of the House Usd again been permitted to assemble together. The sneaker then directed the Clerk to call the roll, when 232 members re sponded to their names, there being 55 absentees. The speaker laid before the house the certificates of election of Horace Davis, H. F. Page, C. P. Berry, and Romualdo Pacheco, of California, Wil liam G. TLompson, of Iowa, aud of Waldo Hutchins of New York, who all took the iron clad oath as members of the House, At 1.50 P. M. the President's annual message was real by the clerk. ^ The reading consumed an hour and a half, and then, on motion of Mr. F. Wood, the message and the accompany ing documents were referred to the Committee of the Whole and ordered to be printed. Then House then, at 3.30, adjourned until to-morrow. were The Export Trade. The New York "Snu" says it is a fact well worth noting, that the exports of domestio merchandise from the Uni ted Slates were larger, in value, during the last fiscal year than during any previous one in the history of this country. It is a Becoud fact worth noting that the exports of all eorts were iu value $711,637,393, and the total imports $445,777,755,—so that the former were to the latter 6J to 4, and surpassed them by $266,859,638. The exports reckoned in a mixed gold and cur rency value ; the imports only in gold. Allowing for this wo have a balance ol about $250,000,000 on the export side. An Insnrauee Agent oil Trial* William Bocke, ex-assignee of the German Insurance Company of Chicago, trial for forgery and conspiracy to defraud the company's creditors, was bonor&bly discharged yesterday.
