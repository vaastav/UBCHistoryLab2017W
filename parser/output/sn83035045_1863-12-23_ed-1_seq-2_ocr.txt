Seasons for this will soon be News Payer PufeUsUittffi in soaie of out Weekly exchanges, of a change tti t terms of their papers. The exigencies of the times, th$ increased price of all eom modities, insjluctin" of course, paper ad ink are sure ly and steadily working a fevoltin in newspaper publishing All the papers in the TiUc,r(iph.)TSnve given notice that payin advance vnU be strictly required, and that all who do not comply with these terms will iave their names stricken off. The Register, of YoiingstowD. has given notice of an ad vance from $1.50 to $2 a year, and payment at that to be in all cases in advance. The Western Reserve Chronicle, at Warren, last week said that it did not wish, if it could avoid it, to raise the price, though it thinks the general advance in every thing would jus tify it, but gave emphatic notice, that advance pay will ha hereafter inflexibly demanded, and all whp fail 40 pay arrears, and one year in advance, will heve their names stricken off. Every publisher is thus beiug driven to the I conclusion, by the stern logic of necessity, that-some chisoge in the terms of publication is absolutely unavoidable. We shall watch with great interest these movements of our cotcmporaries. We are inclined to think, however, that advance pay, without an in- Urease of price, will not meet the case. ' The exigency needs both increase and advance. We believe the Youngstown Register has chosen the wiser course. All daily papers have increased from $5 lo $7 a year and from $6 to $8 and why should not weekly paejors jilso advaii- ? Weekly papers, made up from dailies, have also advanced ; why should not country weekly papers ? Compe tition among publishers, makes them timid. We do not believe there is any occasion for timidity. The majority, on every subscrip tion list, are just men, and they know, every man of them, from their own experience, that newspapers, no more than other commodities and manufactures, can be afforded at old prices. Having confidence in the justice and fairness of the subscribers 0 the Portage County Democrat, we are sure they will Sanction the announcement of the increase of price, when we feel compelled to make it. Report of the Secretary of War. Secretary Stanton reviews our army and navy proceedings against Charleston and says they have not as yet accomplished what was expected of them." In Texas, a large force operating under Banks, ..ill give protection to the people of that Stste, and cut off a chief avenue of the rebels for foreign commerce and foreign aid. The armies of Lee and Meade now occu py relatively the same positions as they did at the date of the last annual report. West Virginia s now clear of rebels and the people f that' State are enjoying in com parative peace, the blessings of Civil Govern ment. The rebel forces in Missouri have been driven beyond the the Arkansas River. No military operations of any magnitude have taken place in Virginia or North Caro lina. . , , ..., , .s . The Federal forces are now firmly planted in- every rebel State. The success "of our arms during the past year has. enabled the Department to make a reduction ot oyer szuu.uw.WU in tne esti mates- for the ensuing year. The blame for the non-eXchange of prison ers is thrown upon the rebel authorities. He discusses the act of Congress for en ralring.and calling out the national forces, and saysthatthe law has been enforced in twelve States, yielding 1500,000 soldiers and $10,- 000,000 for procuring substitutes. The $300 clause is alluded. to, as are the conflicting pro visions:. to regard to its injustice. He says that a large proportion of the troops whoso terras expire next year will re-enlist, it being intended by the Government that they shall have at least one month furlough before their present, terms expire. The indications are that the force required will in a great meas ure be raised by volunteering and without a draft. Since the issuing : of the Proclamation of Emancipation, efforts have been madeto en list colored troops ; 60,000 are now organ ized, and the number will rapidly increase as our arm ia advance. Heavers that the freed slaves make good soldiers, that they are easi ly disciplined, are full of courage, and have proved their manhood and capacity. He al ludes to the inequality of bounties, pay and rations, between colored and-white soldiers. The fortunes of war have brought within our lines large numbers of colored women and children, and some aged and infirm per sons. A solemn tmst rests upon tne uovern- ment for their care and protection. After alluding to some claims agar Department, and. saying that further legisla tion or a further appropriation will be re quired, to carry thera into effect, he concludes as follows : . : - "i 1 "I may be permitted to express the hope that the next annual report from this Depart ment may announce the complete overthrow of the rebellion and restoratron of . peace, and the establishment ef the Union oil a sure foundation in all the bounds of the United States."

If ins Cotton Dethroned. " King cotton" no longer rules the world. The Southern rebels believed they could conquer through the power of cotton. They have been mistaken. The cotton sceptre is broken. The London " Money Market Re view'? flays : " After distress, only equalled by the fortitude with which it was borne, England is gradually emancipating herself from the thraldom in which she was held by her almost exclusive dependence upon Amer ica for the supply of cotton. India is day by day taking the place of America. That she can grow cotton to any extent, and, that the quality of that cotton is capable of vast im provement, is beyond all doubt. The only inducement which she requires is the assur ance of a permanent market ; in a word, that our demand on her is not to be a merely tem porary one, measured only by the American war. Indications are not wanting that India will soon make England independent of China. She has freed England of her de pendence on America for cotton, and promises freedom to alike extent from dependence on China for tea." Never, were miserable rascals more disap pointed in their calculations, than have been the infamous insurgents of the South. TIae maiden Ban It Robbery and murder. The boldness of crime in tins country is indeed startling. On the 16th inst., the Bank of Maiden, located at Maiden Center, Mass., in the -heart of the village, was entered at noon-day, and Frank Converse, aged 17, son of the President, who was alone in the Bank, was shot dead behind the counter. Five thousand dollars in bills were taken from the drawer ; the safe was untouched. The mur der and robbery could not have occupied more than fifteen minutes, yet neither the passers-by upon the street, nor a gentleman who 4id business with the deceased at twenty-five minntcs past 11, and left him quietly reacting a newspaper, nor his younger broth ii er who entered about twenty minutes before 12 o'clock and discovered the victim lying upon the florir behind the counter, heard the rtiot. He died without being able to discloso his assassin, of whom no trace could be dis covered. A reward of $5,000 is offered. Gen.
