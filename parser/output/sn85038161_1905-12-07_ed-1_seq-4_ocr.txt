The dllllcultles In the way of rapid development lu the Philippine Islands are such as to lessen the chances" of competition that has been such a oug bear to many statesmen in this coun try. It has scarcely been worth while tn jm lmrdi-olarlnr a tariff Affalllt Philippine products, or securing com plex rive-to-four Supreme Court de cisions. Exploitation of the Islands Ins been predicted, but so far has not been attempted. Capital backed by shrewd men can and a better ticld In the United States. Xo speculators with money to Invest care to try thu Orient when there are such opportu nities right at home. Men of small means must be presented with very faorable conditions before they will go so far afield for lnvetnient, and small capital will neither exploit nor develop the Islands. Granting the Filipinos free trade, It is believed, will result In making them more contented and lest anxious to get troai under the domination .of the Americans. It will encourage them to bllere they are not held as for eigners. It Is also believed that free trade will produce a healthy and sure development of the islands, that It will be an incentive to production, and that the Filipino will bo encour aged to work. It lb one of the several things promised by Secretary Taft, ai.d be believes that without harm to American products a great deal may be accomplished for the good of the Philippines by establishing free trade with the islands.

"God moves in a mysterious way, for now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face; then shall I know even as I am known." Again It becomes our sad duty to record the passing away of one of our beloved sisters, Mrs. Eliza J. Thomp son, Nov. 3d, 1005, All that Is mortal rests in our beautiful cemetery. Her gentle spirit has entered the gates of fiearls to be with the blood washed throng who are clothed in white robes, with palms In their hands.

Slmplo Directions for Caring for tho Wood Supply on tho Farm. Throughout a large part of the Eastern States nearly evcry;farm has Its woodlot. From that woodlot, which Is often all that remains of the vast forests which originally clothed the region, the farmer supplies his own needs. It furnishes him with fuel, teuce posts, raits, poles, ami even witu timber, boards and shingles to keep the farm buildings In repair. A well managed woodlot Is therefore a very valuable part of the farm, and tnc sum total of all farm woodlots repre sents a very large national asset. "it. TT r f vnc CJnrv'T' b""l fnr some years devoted special attention to the needs of woodlot owners, its co-operation Is offered to all who would have advice on the management of woodlots, and many thousands of acres of farm forests arc now actually cared for under practical systems of forestry which It has recommended. As a general rule, but little care Is devoted to the woodlot. It Is left to shift for Itself, Is often used too free ly for the pasturage of live stock, and Is rarely guarded from lire or forest enemies. When wood Is needed but little discretion Is exercised In the choice of trees, and no need Is felt of providing for the renewal or Improve ment of the stand. Yet it Is decidedly a slciplc matter to care for the woodlot. The owner need not burdenihlmself with any very elaborate system. Nor need he, In most cases, reduce the amount of tlm ber which he cuts. Eventually, of ! course, he can cut more, for more will be grown. The first requirement of the ordinary woodlot Is protection, and the second, selection in cutting. Fire is the chief enemy of the wocd lot. Fires damage the larger trees, starting hollows in thu bints or weak ening them until they begin to die in the top, reducing Jthelr value when cut ; but the greatest harm Is done to I reproduction and the growth of young trees. Running over the forest soil, they consume the litter ami kill the needling. The forest soil becomes too dry to encourage tbe germination of tree seeds. Even If seedlings succeed in finding root and begin to flourish, tbe next tire destroys them. Fires may easily be kept out of the woodlot with a little cate. They are often started to lt.prove the grassing j and pasture. This Is certainly poor j policy. While the graxlng may be lm proved for a few years, the woodlot is often permanently Injured. It Is gen erally a poor plan to expect land to j produce grais and wood at the same I time. Neither will do well, and the ! owner will be paving taxes on land which he only half uses. Grazing an-, Itnals often do much Injury to the wood'ot. They browse upon young , growth and trample It down. They al-1 so pack the soil with their hoofs, de- i xtroylug Its power to retain uioUture and encouraging the cntranccof grass. Grazing should be watched, and should be permitted luthe woodlot only when such harm will not result. In cutting, the first thing to look out for is the young growth. The whole point of forest management is to have new trees of the most useful kind take the place of the old, just as soon as nosslble after they are cut. One , . , i r 4U mi . j luuuy uwubo auuni: ui iuc ha nm ijti rid of a fine sappllng half the size of a man's wrist, If It Is a little In the way, and a dozen years of growth Is lost. On the other hand, the cutting of a good tree may simply open room for worthless trees to take Its place. In some regions care must be taken not to permit the crown cover to be come too open. In a good forest the soil will be soft ana moist, and this soil condition Is essential If the trees are to thrive and make good growth. Opening the ground to the sun dries out the moisture, and often burns out the young growth as though by fire, while tbe trees tend to become branchy if they stand too far apart. Past neglect has produced many woodlots In which the healthy trees of the best kind are chocked with un sound and dead trees, and trees of In ferior kinds. For such cases Improve ment cuttings arc needed. It will pay to spend the time and labor necessary to remove the dead, crooked, and dis eased trees, together with tbe weed trecB, so that the rcmalndlng stand may be composed of good timber trees In sutllclcnt number, under conditions favorable for their best development. This can be done gradually, as the material can be utilized. When once the Improvement cut ting has brought the woodlot Into but-Incss-Uku shape, further operations should be made with a view to repro duction and a lasting supply. Care should be taken tn felling, working up, and hauling out wood to do as little damage as possible to young growth. If reproduction Is to take place from seed, the proper location for seed tree must be consldeied. Where the forest Is coinpecd mate, ly of such trees as oak and chestnut, hlch sprout well f mm the stump, It may bcadvlsible to cut most of the good-sized trees, over a part of the woodlot, for the purpose of raising a crop of sprouts Such sprouts grow rapidly and produce good poles, poats, ind ttes at arosunaratlvHyearly age But the stumps should be cut low and Wanting, so as to prevent rotting and ecur5 strotiif and numerous shoots. There are a number of thinning sys tem, some of which niiy suit the re quirements of one woodlot but not those of another. Dy a careful read ing of Bulleton No. 42 of the Forest Service, entitled "The Woodlot," the owner can familiarize himself with these and choose whichever one his own woodlorean-' observation suggest as the best. Or.aould the owner de sire a special plan for the manage ment of bis woodlot. be should make application to the Forester. U. 8.

JEWS IN ENGLISH SOCIETY Tho Excollent Welcome nnd Stand ing Which They Find in Sa lons at Court In England nnd In London, where so many different social wheels fit within wheels, thero still exist somo very closo and carefully preserved circles. Thcso nro, for tho most part, composed of tho members of very old and very proud English nobility and gentry, and this coterlo of families Is ns haughtily re served and as oxcluslvo as the carefully hedged about aristocracy of Austria or old Franco, says Lady Uroomo, in Alnslcc's. Regarded, however, as a whole, I do not think I can truthfully say that Lon don society Is qulto so difficult to enter or bo chary of now blood and newcom ers us is thu ucci edited una empowered and established smart set which rules nntl regulates, In, let us say, New York. In tho first placo London society Is much too big and made up of too many dlffrront foments In order painstaking ly to examine Into and consider the an tecedents nnd qualifications of every man and woman who knocks for admis sion to Its agrrcable circle. It welcomes, with hearty greeting, all amusing, cheerful, Interesting Individuals, who conduct themselves decorously, nnd n Brent part of Its pleasantness lies In tho fact that It Includes artists, nuthors, ac- l tors, statesmen, dusky-skinned oriental princes, as well as tho fairest nnd gay est of American beauties, In Its dr wing room gathrrlngs. Nothing. I think, Is more distinctive Of ttll.U rtfl tlUnlit CUi' i,.t.l Ufll!
