"WELL, Sara Bernhardt will not leave the great north-west ignorant of her pow­ ers as a great actress long, and it is said, authoritatively, that she will grace the Academy boards in Minneapolis some time in January. THE next legislature of Minnesota, which will be known as the twenty-sec ond session, meets in St. Paul, four weeks from last Tuesday, which will be the "first Tuesday after the first Monday of Janu­ ary," as required by law. THE "Waseca Radical is again under the editorial control of its owner, \V. G. Ward. We regret to see that the paper is anything but high-toned under his management, lie is fighting Dunnell as vigorously now as before election. TIIE Presidential electors met in all the states Dee. 1st, and cast their votes for the candidates of their respective parties. Garfield received 214 votes Hancock 155, composed of the "solid south" 138, with 5 from California, 3 from Nevada, and 9 from New Jersev. TIIE "blushing bt iii)el" is the latest sensation in fashion. It is constructed with temple springs that press the veins when the lady bows, and of course a pink tinjie passes over her face, anit the person addressing her imagines that this love.y flush re?nits from the pleasure of the meeting Let us pass on to the next. As WE intimated last week, the at tempted burglarizing oi Gulbrundson's safe at Albert Lea proved to have been "co Ued up" by a detective. The Stand­ ard gives the facts as follows: '"On Mon­ day last the man who was arrested for at tempting to burglarize Gr.lbrandson's store was discharged from custody, lie proved to be one A Wi»d, a noted de­ tective {in the emp'oy of Pinkerton's de­ tective agency in Cliic ig sand the sup­ posed burgiaiy was a ruse to get him into jail in connection with the Riley case." The Text Book Act to Stand. Judges Giltill tn and F. 11. E. Cornell, of the Supreme Court, and Wilkin and Bi ill of the District court, with the Sec retary of State, made the canvass of the vote cast on the text book law. The vote as cast is 4-1,739 in favor of continuing the law and 45,465 against it. But the law under which the question was sub­ mitted required that a majority of all the xotes cast at said election shall be against the law to suspend its provisions, and as there were 120,000 votes polled in the counties authorized to vote upon the prop osi'.ion, aud the negative votes.lacking about 15,000 of a majority, the declara­ tion is that the law shall continue for five year9 more, when it will require two thirds of all the votes cast to suspend the law. Examination of John Riley. HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS. The ground on which the writ of habeas corpus was issued, which was sued out by John Riley last week Wednesday, was argued before his honor, Judge Farmer, on Thursday, and on Friday a decision given. Judge Farmer refused to quash the writ on the motion of Page. He also refused to discharge the prisoner, but ruled that the crime was a bailable one, and fixed the amount of bail at $5,000 for the appearance of Riley ai Dexter Dec. 6th. He ruled that the choice of jails rests with the committing magistrate, and •when that officer decides upon that, it is final and conclusive, and he (the Judge) could not review it upon a writ of habeas corpus. THE EXAMINATION. It wa9 nearly seven o'clock Monday evening before court opened at Dexter. An affidavit of prejudice and bias of Jus­ tice Gaskill was made by Riley, and the case was transferred to Kelley, another justice in same town. Court then ad­ journed to 9 A. M. Tuesday. 'J'lie first witness sworn Tutsday A. was Sherman Page, who was on the stand about three honrs. Page introduced some letters In evidence from the Warden of the Wisconsin state prison showing that Riley had been an inmate of that institu­ tion, and that his brothers, Tom and Frank, were there when he was released. A. E Cox testified as to some matters connected with the shooting. These two witnesses cousuuitd the fore­ noon. In the afternoon Larry Nugent and Geo. Rapp were sworn. They saw the pris oner in Austin during the summer. Did not know whether it was before or after the shoo'ing. Some man who works for Jim Patch in Nevada was sworn. He said he was a guard in the Wisconsin prison at a time when John Riley was there. Amos Hill was sworn. He met a man the night of the shoting running towards town from the direction of Page's house. The night was so dark that he could not tell who It was. The detective, Wood, was on the stand, when our informant left Dexter. There area large number of witnesses yet to be heard, and it is thought the examination will not close before this (Wednesday) evening. The Chinese Tr**4t«a. Two treaties have been negotiated with China. The first relates mainly to the question ot Chinese emigration and the other is a commercial treaty. In the first the Chinese government practically leaves the subject of regulating emigration to the decision and control of the United States. Th« commission which was sent to China found much lets difficulty in treating upon this branch of the subject than had been anticipated, owinf to the tact that the Chinese government have sever been anxious to have its citicens emigrate to any country in such numbers as they have to this. China held that, under the treaty between the two nations, the right of Chinese citizens to come to the United States was clear, as was the 4«ty of our authorities to protest them. Still, as there seemed to be so much trou­ ble over the matter in certain quarters, aud such strong opposition to the pres­ ence of ChinameM, the settlement of ihe terms upon which they could hereafter enter the country was left almost entirely to the United States. In return for this concession, some new and important com­ mercial privileges have been granted in the second treaty, which regulates the whole subject of commercial intercourse. Hereafter Chinese shipping will be placed on the same footing as that of the most favored ualions. It is expected that the duties paid last summer under protest on the Chinese vessel which put in at San Francisco will be refunded within a week. A second Chinese vessel will arrive at Sau Francisco, and will be allowed to enter that port upon the same terms that are imposed upon ships of other nations. These two treaties, while separate instru­ ments, will be considered together, and be treated as virtually one by the execu­ tive. It is expected that the president, in his annual message, will make a general statement of the nature of these treaties, and transmit them to the senate in execu­ tive session, with a full statement of the work of the commission in negotiating them. Then prompt ratification at the hands of the senate is expected. The Chinese authorities have already been ex­ erting their influence through the consu­ late officers ot Havana to check any fur tlier emigration of Chinese labor to the South. Strong efforts have been made for some time past by the sugar-planters in Louisiana to import Cliiuese labor from Cuba, but thus lar it has met with little success, owing to the opposition of the Chinese consul, and hereafter it is likely to be almost entirely stopped. It is believed that the new treaty of com­ merce with China will give a great im­ petus to the trade between the two coun­ tries. Vulgar Words. What can be more vile than vulgar words? What habit can be more utterly without excuse than vulgar talking, more meaningless or more degrading? We think so well of our women that we cannot lay this charge of vulgarity at their door. We know there are vulgar women, but we are proud to say that we think ihe great mass ot them are cleau speaking. May God have mercy on a vulgar woman—for we never will! We have no language with which we can fitly characterize this vile habit in men and when itcouies to talking about it iu wo men, words are meaningless. A vulgar woman unfit company for the beasts. And a good woman who will in any way encourage a vulgar-speaking woman, commits, we think, a most heinous sin. It' the good woman can do no more she can rebuke the vulgar word with a silence that is withering. No vulgar person, man or woman, should iu any way be en­ couraged iu the utterance of a vulgar word. But in this article we address ourself chiefly to men. It was among men the habit of vulgarity was born aud it is among men that it rankly flourishes. And we wish we could say something here that would have a tendency to cuie this vile, vicious aud most unnecessary abit. A vulgar word never means anything in common conversation—never. Aud what sense is there, or comfort can there be, in pouring out a lot of stuff that simply befouls yourself, and every body el.-e within hearing of your voice? A man who does this, must know, if he ever gives the matter a thought, that he is de­ grading himself that he is absolutely poisoning the world with filth. We take great care of our victuals. We want them clean. Our water must be pure and clean. We want our houses kept cleanly. We want our clothing clean. Good women may work them­ selves to death to keep our food, our homes, our clothing clean, and we call them good house-keepers. But what do we ourselves do to keep the man himself clean Do you ask: What standard would you set up for men's speech Just this. Speak so that if your speech at any time—and all unknown to you— should be overheard by a number of wo­ men whom you most respect, and that it the doors which separated you from them should be instantly thrown open, you could face them without a blush. What a !gnificeut man is he who thus orders his speech! And what earthly reason is there why all meu should not do so? We sny to fathers: Always speak so that you will have no occasion to blush should your wives and daughters over­ hear you. Fathers kuow that this is a good and true test. How many are will ing to square their speech in accordance with it? We say to youns feptak so lhat you will never be ashamed to know lhat your good mother, or jr»ur sis ter, or your &weel-heart has overheard you. How many young men are willing to ap­ ply this test lo their speech? How many fathers do say things they would not like to have their wives aud daughters hear. How many brothers say things they would not like to have their sisters hear. How many men, who style themselves as gentlemen, say things thev would not like to have their lady frieuds hear. How many young men say things they would be ashamed to have their sweet-hearis hear. And what a sorry thing that this is so and how conclu­ sively it proves the wickedness and dir­ tiness of vulgar words. A word that is unfit for a pure woman to hear is unfit to use. Men may talk upon matters which should not be subjects of conversation in the presence of women, but such matters can be discussed iu pure, clean language. There is no occasion for the use of filthy words any where, at any time, or in talk­ ing npon sny subject. In this article we only plead decen­ cy. Wby should not every well disposed man give heed to our words? A. man ac­ tually thinks more of himself if he keeps his clothing sad his body clean. He will think iufinitely more of himself if he keep* bis mind and his mouth clean. Old man, middle-aged man, young man, try this, and be surprised to see what a charm it adds to your life. The atmos phere around you will seem purer because you are purer within. We waat fathers to show this article to Ifaeir eons 'twill do them food. We want wivea to show thia article to their husbands it can do them no harm to read it. Wc waat mothers to show it to their sons 'twill do them good. We want sisters to put it before their brothers 'twill do them good. We want young women, who have sense and bravery enough to do so, to call the attention of the young men who are waiting upon them, to it 'twill do them good. Aud men, let us all, for the sake of ourselves, for the snkc of our mothers, and our wives, our sisters, our daughters, for the sake ot all the "little children every where, for the sake ot all humanity, let us do just as little vulgar talking as pos­ sible—aud that is just none at all. Dliiiiu-sota Sugar. The Faribault refinery gives evidence )f profitable business for the farmer who raises amber cane. The Democrat has the following in regard to the refinery and its results: "The small amouut of sugar already refined, although by an imperfect ma­ chine, aud consequently not Well cleaned of molasses, was a fine article and highly satisfactory, the crystals feeing large and firm aud entirely free from foreign mat­ ter, the polariscope test showing a purity ot 95 to 98 per cent. It is estimated that the sugar product this season will be about ten tons, valued at nine cents per pound. But the production of sugar is but a very small portion ot the business of the refinery this season. There were about 400 tons of cane worked up at the refinery and the amouut of crude syrup produced elsewhere aud refined here will reach at least 1,000 barrels, of which Mr. Seth Keuney, of Morristown, the most successful cane grower of the State, furn­ ished 250 barrels. The relined syrups are pure and free of adulteration, have a heavy body aud are of a rich, delicate flavor. Orders for this syrup are pouring iu from all quarters and there is uo trou­ ble iu disposiug of it the principal trouble being to t.ell judiciously and let the test of the goods be as widespread as possible. Eastern dealers have begged for the entire product ot the refine.y, but this has been refused, as the object is to let the people know that the Faribault, Minnesota, refinery is not only producing a first class article of syrup, but a perfect­ ly pure article—facts already admitted by New York experts. In response to a request of Governor Pitlsburv, Dr. Wilheiin has written anil caused to be published in pamphlet form, tiie results of his experiment in the Far­ ibault refinery and yives the cost of pro­ duction at about 15 cents per gallon, the yield from 1G0 to 200 gallons per acre, aud the profit over all expense from $18 to $20 per acre. The l)r. urges the central re­ finery system as the uiont satisfactory, and issks lhat ihe planters consult him and Mr. !ly in reference to methods by which they can produce the best results. The capacity of the refinery is to be greatly increased and there is no lousier the leas' question but what cane-growing and su­ gar making on ail extensive scale is now an assured fact in Minnesoia.
