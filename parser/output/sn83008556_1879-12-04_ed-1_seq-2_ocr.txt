Tho LewiPbnra-, Centre and Sprueo Creek Railroad to Paea to tho Pennsylvania P.all road Company. The Pennsylvania railroad company w ill soon add another line ot rails and ties to its long list of branches in the foreclosure of the mortgage of the Lewisburg, Centre and Spruce Creek railroad company, whose bonds it holds in the sum of $2,000,000. In 1877 the people of Peon's valley, one of the richest valleys of the state, with the assistance of the Pennsylvania railroad, opened tiro now insolvent road from from Lewisburg, on tlie Northern Cen tra! railroad, as far as Spring Mills, in Perm's valley, a distance of forty-two miles, with the intention in the future, should business warrant the scheme, >f extending tho line to Tyrone, on the main line of the Pennsylvania railroad the entire length of the road to bo t igh ty-four miles. Beyond the completed portion there are about seventeen miles of the road graded, but as yet without superstructures. The original object of the new line was to open up exten sive ore banks located in that section of the country, but the business of the country thus far lias been limited to the transportation of agricultural pro ducts down from Penn's valley and carrying kick coal and s'ore goods. ! The Pennsylvania railroad really built ! the line by advaucing the $2,000,000 to the company and taking their hist . mortgage bonds for the money so ad vanced, and the foimer corporation has ; held au operating lease of it ever since. But the venture thus far has proved unprofitable, so much so that the un paid interest on the bonds has accumu lated to nearly the face value of the : bonds themselves. At last the Ponu | eylvania railroad company has deter ; mined to foreclose the mortgage, wipe J out the capital stock, which represents I only about $250,00J, and assume the ! absolute ownership and management of I the branch. It will be sold Ait t'e ] Philadelphia exchange by James A. Freeman & Co., auctioneers, on the 13th, iast., and there is no possibility of any one stepping in to ootbi 1 the bondholders, to do which they must re | lieve the mortgage of the load it now | carries.— Harrisburg Patriot. The Republicans have only 1,800 majority in Massachusetts. They ought to be ashamed of theanelvos with such a contemptible figure as that for the Bay state. The statue to the brave soldier, Gen. Thomas, was inaugurated by the army of the Cumberland, at Washington. There was no volunteer military organ ization from the North present, but several companies from the South were there to do the great soldier honor. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis, prominently known as an able general of the Union Army, died at Chicago last week. Additional Locate. —Philip B.

Head the bills. —Wcsee by the Mittlinburg Telegraph that to-day two weeks ago Musser's store in Ilartleton was entered by thieves and a number of hats and some "small change''stolen. —The Uuion County Teachers' Insti tute will meet at Lewisburg, Monday, Dec. lath, and adjourn Friday, Dec. ISth. That's a sensible time in which to hold an institute. Don't consider it at al' proper to have it just on and the days before and after Christmas. —The Journal Book Store is rapidly filling up with goods and the assort ment is or will soon be very complete. The house is complete, wo have moved, and are now in a condition to give our business our undivided attention. Don't fear to find the door locked—ex cepting at meal time—when you come, or nobody here to serve you. It is our purpose as it will be our pleasure, to make business boom, and deserve the patronage of the public. —Schoch, of tho Ickqraph is a real selfish fellow. He talks of buying the lailroad all alone. Now why couldn't lie give us a chance too, or at least pro pose a partnership, the impudent imp ? —The last one of eight crossings was completed the other day.
