Be considers that tbe present manu factoring depression is the result of ever production ; which is clear enough. He farther considers that since our manu facturing facilities are In excess of the requirement of the country, the way out of the trouble Is te obtain a foreign outlet for them which also Is ;clear enough, if it Is admitted that we make mere than we consume new, or are likely te con sume In the near future. That this is the case new is Indisputable ; and whether or no the demand of the country is going te seen grew up te its facilities for sup. plj, which Is very doubtful, it is at least certain that n foreign market, in addition te the home- market, would be a very desirable thlDg for our manufacturers te bare. Mr. McCulloch proposes that a com mission of:member:of the Heuse shall be formed te inquire into the practicability of obtaining a market in foreign coun tries for our manufacturers, by a modi fication of the import duties which new close them te 1135 which commission shall consider two things as settled ; namely, that tbe revenue te be raised shall be only such as is required for tbe expenses of the government; and second that the manufacturing Industries are net te be put in Jeopardy. The legislation te be recommended must be in their interest, which is the inter est of the whole country. The aim in amending the tariff will be te secure an outside market for our products, and that is surely one with which manufacturers should be In sym pathy. "We have great advantages ever etner countries for manufacturing, in me possession of the important raw materials, the best machinery, the beat mechanical talent and the best workmen. When we have the best workmen we also have the cheapest, in industries demand ing skill in manipulation. "Europe has a lower priced labor ; but low-priced labor is net necessarily cheap labor. It is often the dearest. "We new send a great many manufactures abroad, and tbe quantity may be greatly Increased by legislation tbat will enable us te get cheaper materials, and that will give our products free entrance te foreign perta. We obviously need free raw ma terial te start with ; and the secretary urges Congress te at once enact that such materials shall be admitted free of duty. He also recommends ihe abolition of the Internal revenue tax en tobacco, and en alcohol used for manufacturing pur poses. He states that since 1850 Great Britain has net taxed alcoholic spirits that have been mixed with weed naphtha. which are called methylated spirits. Se neated they are said te be unflt for use as a beverage, and In this casoueone can object te the removal of the tax. Alcohol used in manufactures and med icines, certainly should be as cheap as possible ; and no reason for Its taxation can be urged save its use as a beverage. The message and utperts. Mr. Arthur has "glided through the official routine" of his duties with dig nity and decorum and in a colorless ahd unimpressive sort of way. nis last message te Congress and te the country has the same characteristics. In its treatment of foreign affairs it embodies the fnmlliar idea of President Tayler mat we are "at peace with all the world mm lueitrst ui uj.iuKinu, ana it is a geed condition in which te be and te remain. The fact that all nations are coming mere and mere te be of this mind, renders tbe discussion of military and naval questions of secondary im portance and remands the science of warfare and of defense te the rear of commercial and maritime Interests. As we get further away from tbe late war the Union sentiment becomes stronger and stronger and Is te day ha certain in the Seuth as in the North; tbe increasing efficiency of the national guard In nil the states is ample guaran tee of domestic tranquility ; and this militia could be quite as readily organ ized into an effective army for foreign war as auy Immediate exigency will demand. It is true that our navy is weak and contrasts ridiculously with the armament of many second nnd tnlrd -'"'rate powers ; it has net yet been made manifest tbat this country needs a navy en the high Eeas for aggression ; far less urgent certainly is the necessity for it than if we had a merchant marine built up. Our long line of seacoast and num erous ocean ports are exposed te easy attack at present, but there is Constantly decreasing peril of that kind ; meanwhile all the old theories of naval defense are being revolutionized se rapidly, that with the development of dynamite and torpedo methods, we may seen come te cheaper, quicker and mere effective modes of resistance than the navy department new gropes for. Most assuredly the experience of the country with the Republican administrators of the navy and its favored ship build. era since the war has net commanded popular confidence, and no great Interest will be felt In this department until a new administration introduces new men and measures. The postal department is the one of most universal Interest In Its operations and every tendency toward cheaper pest, age illustrates advancement in adminis tration. Tbe recommendations of the department and tbe president in this direction seem te be founded in geed reason and cannot fail te be gratefully received. It ia te the report of Secretary McCul loch, and the president's views upon questions of finance and taxation, v: m. tbat the greatest attention will be dlree. Md. As far as they go they will be i.fMMrally accepted as sound, except tbe approval of subsidies ; though it will be observed tbat President Arthur is far mere non-committal than his sec retary, and Illustrates tbe difference between a politician desiring te satisfy all sides and a hard headed financier with practical notions ei bis own. Tbe reccommendatlen of a pension for Grant, springs no doubt from tbe sytupa thctic impulses of tbe executive Tliere is no consideration of national grutltude nor ei geed public policy that warrants it. FuirrnEK evidence is furnished of the 03nditien and of the administration of the Lancaster county prison by tbe dis graceful story of free and easy commu nication of male and female prisoners, sentenced te " separate and solitary confinement," who cut holes in the par tition between their adjoining cells, and thus get together. The undcr keepers blame It en the rotten jail ; the Inspectors " censure" tbe underkeepers and damn the jail tee ; which has pre vieusly excited the condemnation of courts and grand Juries. The public, which has been hearing of these thlugs for years holds its nese at the renewed report of them, and while wondering whose duty it is te build the oft de manded new jail, concludes that a new kind of Inspectors, keepers and jail ad ministration Is about as sorely needed as a stronger prison. TnB state treasurer jogs along with the snug balance of $S12,7S3 -13 in the general fund, although the legal limit is feOO.OOO. The deposit in the People's bank, Philadelphia, has been cut down te $10,000, but the Unlontewn and Pittsburg banks held up their end of the line with about $200,000 of the people's money. The president's message makes a rather lively requiem for a dead party. The base ball seed Is already trying te penetrate above the frozen ground. Abe Buzzard's career comes In very conveniently just new j tbe ammunition of the campaign liar was nearly exhausted.

Secretary McCullecu has entirely tea much of the sanguine la his composition when he suggests anether tariff cemmis sien. One a century is about as much this nation will be able te stand. 03 It is again proposed te pension the no. ttoeal mendicant, U. 8. Grant, and tbe suggestion comes from no less eenaible person than President Arthur. Since the Grant & Ward developments, the appoint ment of a cemmittee would seem mere In order. The Reading railroad has inaugurated the era of economy in the management of the read by matking down the salaries of its empleyes from flve te ten per cent. It seems net unfair that labor in this com pany should share the distress under which the capital of the concern has been long laboring. TnE Injunction suit of the 13ell telephene oempany te prohibit the People'e telopheno company from using the Drawbaugh in struments that conflict with the Bell pat ents, has been decided jn favor of the Bell oempany. The famous controversy is net however, absolutely settled, as it will be appealed te the United States supreme court. But the Bell oempany have the b?st of the situation thus far, as their claims have new the protection of an in junction. Everyone in national offleial life, whose office In any way permits the indulgence, takes his kick at the trade dollar. The president applies his beet te It and grave secretary McOulIech does net disdain te apply te it a pointed admixture or shoe leather. Yet the unwecome guest refuses te go, Though it is intrinsically mere valaahle than the silver dollar that the government Is needlessly, shoveling en the oeuntry at the rate of $.3,000,000 par month, its bullion value is only about 80 cents.

The question hew shall our fereign trade be increased is the question whieh new comes te the front and demands prompt and careful conaideration. Manufacturers are primarily interested, bat the whole ceuutry has a stake iu its solution. In Its iuvestiuatten the taiiff will necessarily be involved, inasmuch as the relations be tweeu it and our foreign trade are se close that they oannet ba considered separately, but it need net be involved exoept by se far as it stands in the way of international trade. If the duties upon raw materials are an obstruction, theso duties should be removed. If tbe duties upon ether articles are an obnruetiou, they should be medi tied. Whatever may ba rcquired te in- crease our fereign trade, whether it be a repeal or moditicatien of existing duties, should be demauded by the manufacturers themselves. Hew, then, shall the Infor mation required for a full understanding of what stauds in the way of an increased exportation of our manufactured coeI h obtained ? It may net be proper for me te euer aavice en wus point, but I cannot forbear te say that I can see no better means than by the appointment of a commission, composed of men net wedded te the doctrines of froe trade or protection fair-minded men, who would prosecute the inquiry thoroughly, oemprohensible, aud impartially. It sueh a commiislen should be created. It should ba dene with out unnecessary delay. In the commencement of Its wnrk thn commission should, I think, regard the fol lowing points as being settled : First. That the publie revenues are net re oe iu excess or wbat may be required for the support of tbe government, and me gradual reduction of the publie Second. That our manufactures, whisb, under tbe festering care of the govern ment, have attained such gisan'ie propor tions and who:e oresneritv in Mwntki tr, the welfare of all ether interests, and net te be put in jeopardy bv radical nn.l sweeping changes in the tariff ; aud that all reduotieus of import duties Bheuld. b- iniuimemitw w ueir markets from whiea they are new In a large degree CTJKUJUUCU. If such a commission as had been sug Rested had been appointed, and its weik could be performed at an early date, I should net ba disposed te say anything beaiiuir directly upon the tariff; but as relief from the preeent burden of taxation is urgently and justly demanded, I deem it my duty te suggest that something in this direction should be done without da lay. Offing te the shortness of time allowed me for the consideration of the subject, I nui net prepared te name the arttelcs upon whieh duties should be re moved or rodueed. I should regret this if CeugretB were net already in possession of the facta which should govern ita ae tieu. This rnueh, however, it may be preper for roe te recommend : First. Tht the existing duties upon raw materials which are te be used in manu faeture should ba removed. This can be dene in tbeintereat of our foreign trade. Beoend. That the duties upon the art! eles us3d or consumed by these who are the least able te bear the burden of taxa tien should ba redueed This also can be effected without prejudice te our expert trade. In regard te our Internal revenue taxes, I have te say that, as these taxes, with the exception of the tax upon whisky, ought net te be and will net be noeded ferrcve nue if appropriations are kept withiu reasonable bounds and rigid economy is establish iu all branehes of the publie service, I see no geed reason for their continuance. OUIl BUlPriNQ INTEHEST. Of this important interest he says tbat iu direet connection with the oendltion of our fTelKU trade is tha condition of our merchant service. The causes of the do de do eliuo of our shipping ere se well under steed that any remarks en this point are quite unueeessary. The humiliating fact stares us iu the face that while the United States net miny yaara age led all the nations in ship building and was scoend only te Great liritaln in oejau tennage, it has almost ceased te be recognized as a maritime power. This revolution has been caused by the diversion of American eapital aud onergy te manufaotuiieg and ether internal interests and the substitu tion of iron for weed In the oenstruotlon of ships. The obstacles In the way of a restoration of our foreign shipping will net be found In the cost of shijs which are te hi built in the United States, but in the absence of a demand for thorn. The great and profitable eirrylng trade between the United States and Europe has baeu allowed te pass in the hanrtunf the ship owners cf ether nations. Se oem- piete is ineir oentroi or it, se large the eapital invented in it and se sharp aud persistent would be the oentest if wa should attempt without government aid te share iu it, that our capitalists would net ourapeie ler it. .uteit4ining these views, he recommends that, as we ought te have an lnteres; in the busluess we create and as tle restoration of our shipping interest is important if net essential te the exten sion of our fereign trade, subsidies in the form of liberal payments for the transport iuuu ui maws or in come ether form should be offered as an inducement te Investments or capital In steamships. PUBLIC DEDX AHD CONDITION OF THE TllEAaimY, It Is highly gratifying te the sccretary te notice the great reduotlen of the publie debt ainee it reached its highest point, in August, 1805. The total debt at that date was $2, 750,431, 571.13, and the annual In tereit oharge $150,077,007.87, the average rate of interest paid being 0.31 per ceut November 1, 1881, the total debt, less cash in the treasury, was $1,408,482,018 09, tbe and the average rata of interest paid wu 11 92 nor cent., miklnv n riniin.. j- ;. uuuiiui niLoresi, uumgu was iloj)8;)l,e0 J5f JZ& lXte.A$&MZl?&.? " I'l'HWW WI MlUUkUbU IU1UD. a reduction of I mero than two-third in the annual v interest charge and nearly eue-tmlf in the rate of interest lutd. In the management of Its debt the United 9 States has been an exatuple te the world. While heavy taxes were uece.'faty te ac cemplish these marvelous results thesei taxes have neither clicofced eutcrprlse uer retarded growth. While, howevor, the publie debt Is iu this MtUfiotery oetid i tien there nre seme tlnanci.il dangers nln-nd which can only be avoided by changes in our tluaucial legislation. lhe most imml ni' nt of these daopets ai 1 the due te which the secretary asks the especial at tontleu of Congress arises from the oeu tlnued colnage of silver aud the increasing representation of it by silver olrtifleutcs. lie holds that both geld and silver are ab solutely necessary for a circulating lue.llum and that neither can bj disused without Injurious effeets upon home and inter national trade. But geld and silver can only be made te maintain thelr com pur. atlve value by the joint aotieu el commer cial nations. As most Kurupean nations have demenetised iilver it is Impassible for a slogle nation te maintain the oldtime relative value of the two metiils. After giving the subject the most oarclulcensld oration he Is foreod te the conclusion that unless both the coinage of the silver dollars and the issue of silver eertitleates are sus pended, there Is great dauber that silver, aud net geld, may beoemo our metallic standard. Te guard against this danger he strongly urges Congress te suspend or repeal tbe silver coiuage act. THE SATION.lt. nNK$. The number of national banks In oper ation November 1, 183 1, was 2,072. The number of uatleual bauks erganised during the year past was 101. with nu aggregate eapital of $10,015,230 Siuce the establishment of the sj stem there have been organized 8,201 national banks. Of theee 139 have gene iute ve'untiry liqui datien and 100 have bt'en placed iu the hands of roceivers. The circulation de ci eased by the retiremt-nt of bnuds held for the purpose of senr"g, circulation during the year $25,158,452. Inasmuch as about $135,000,000 of the circulation of banks is based upon our three per ccct. bends, which are new rcdcomable and being rapidly rodeemed, remedial aotien cannot be postponed beyond the present session if a rapid reductteu of our bitik nete circulation Is te be avoided. Tbat the national baukiug system has beeu of great service te the government ; that it has furnished a bank note circulation of uniform value aud safe beyond qucst'en, is admitted eveu by its opponents. All this being true, Its preservation is a mat ter of national import uce, its discentin uance would be a national calamity. Same measure should be adopted of mere than temporary expediency looking te its fu ture perpetuation.
