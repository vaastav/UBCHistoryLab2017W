John H. Ott, the young man who was arrested here for grand larceny on telegrama from the San Francisco police, Is evidently an all-around crooked propositions According to the San Francisco papers, Ott ha accused the Albuquerque police of aiding and abetting him in concealing the I1.10U which he is charged with -stealing rom a room mate named Johnson in the coast city. It will be remembered that Ott was arrested and held here nine days awaiting the arrival of a Ban Fran cisco olficer, and that he was finally taken -west a few daya ago by Detec tive Freel. ' vUpon his arrival in San Francisco, when Ott was asked about the dispo sition he had made of the stolen mon ey, ha Intimated that Policeman Jor dan of this city had aided him in hid ing the awag, which he asserted he had burled '"under Jordan's stable." v Policeman Jordan was astounded and somewhat wroth when a clipping to this effect from the San Francisco Call was shown to hinvby the Morning Journal reporter last night. t '-ott' Astonishing: Allegation. . The article in the Call is as follows: ,r The police believe that John H. Ott, who waa brought back from Albuquer que yesterday -by Detective Freel, has cached the greater portion of the $1100 he stole from Frank Johnson in the city where he was captured. - On the return trip he hinted to Freel that Special Policeman Jordan, who capture him helped to Conceal the money. Ott told Freel that he had burled the money In Jordan's stable. - He was permitted by his captor to go into the stable, and while there, he qlaimed, ha "planted" the loot The local police are. confident that he had the money with him when ho was caught in Al buquerque. Freel had great difficulty In aettina the prisoner. Jordan at first positive-, ly refused to surrender him until the I reward of $25 was paid. After much 1 bickering Freel finally wired to Chief Dlnan for the money.- The peculiar fact that Ott had only $180 when ar rested roused Freel 'a suspicions. He remarked upon it to Jordan. The spe .clal finally let Freel take the prisoner without paying the reward. 1 Ott contradicted , himself several times after reaching this city. Chief Dlnan is somewhat In doubt as to whether his accusation against Jordan Is true. He will wire Albuquerque and have the matter sifted to the bottom. Ott, who is a bricklayer,! robbed Frank Johnson, a brother In the craft, of $1100 in this city several weeks ago. The chief of police received a letter from his wife In, the east last Friday asking him to locate her husband, sue Is. Ignorant of his plight. Most of the money taken by Ott was In bills. Jordan Is Indignant. As was stated In the Morning Jour nal, at the time,-only $196 was found upon Ott'a person byAChief of Police McMlllin, after the prisoner had been stripped and thoroughly searched. Mr. Jordan was detailed to keep Oti under surveillance, and according! took charge of the young man for over a week, until the officer arrived for him -U Is the most aatoundlmr niece ingratitude I ever heard of, " said Jor dan last night. "Ott was taken from the limited train here by Night Mar shal Kennedy and Policeman Wagner and three days afterward the city mar. shal Instructed me to keep him un der surveillance. The boy appeared to be rather delicate and as he said he couldn't eat in' a restaurant, I took him to , my own house and fed him and made him comfortable. I wa$ rather inclined to think the boy was imposed upon, until one day he said to me: 'Supposing I waa found guilty nf Rteallng that money, what could they do to me?' " " 'Oh, you might get ten years In the penitentiary,' I renlled." ."'Hupposing the money was never found, what then?' asked Ott." " 'That's enough of that,' I said to Ott. 'If you want to make any con fasslon, you'll have to go to the city marshal. And that waa the last he said on the matter. ?'I might say further," said Mr. Jor dan, with a smile, "that I haven't a sign of a stuble or ahen coop or even a dog house on my premises." . While Ott was hefo he refused to divulge to the police what became of the , money he was alleged to have stolen, and protected his utter ignor ance of any such theft. He told a Morning Journal reporter upon the night of his arrival that he "didn't know a thing about it." He is evi dently a young degenerate if he made the statements attributed to him by the Kan Francisco police, who clulm lo have him dead to rights on the lar ceny charge. ' Heevtved No Reward. "The statement that we got a re ward for Ott's capture from the San Franclaco authorities la wrong," said ' Chief McMlllin last night. "We never got a cent for his capture and Freel didn't even offer to pay the young man'a board, after we had held him for nine days and kept a man guard ing him. As It Is customary'to pay a reward In such casos I wired to find nut If one was offered for Ott. When I got a negative answer Ott was Imme. d lately turned over to Freel."
