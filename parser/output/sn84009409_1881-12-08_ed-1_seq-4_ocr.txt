THE OEOANIZATION Or THE VIRST SESSION OF THAT BODV YESTERDAY. Wash I.noto v, December s.—Senator Davis formally convened the Senate at noon. The credentials of Senator-elect Win dom were presented and he was duly qualified and entered upon his duties. A resolution providing for committees of notification to the house of repre sentatives and the president, informing them of the organization, waa adopter!. A large number of bills were intro duced, among them the following: By Mr. Garland —For the appoint ment of a commission to investigate the question of the tariff and revenue law.

Among other petitions introduced and temporarily laid on the table were a number against unjust discriminations in railroad rates, and to forbid alleged extortions in freight and transportation charges. Senator Ferry submitted a resolution instructing the committee on patent* to consider and report, by bill or otherwise, auch proposed legislation as ahall effectually protect all innocent purchasers and users of devices, inven tions, or articles patented under the laws of the Unired Slates from pay ment or obligations to pay any royalty for aucb purpoae. or the use of any pat ented article abandoned to public or general uae by the inventor or patentee thereof, or from the payment of any royalty for such purchase or use of any patented article whatever, unless the elaim therefor shall formally be made or presented by the inventor or pat entee to the purchaser or user of the same within two years after such pur chase or firat uae of the device or arti cle ao claimed to have been duly paten ted. Mr. Ferry asked for present con sideration of the aame, but the resolu tion waa laid over one day under the rules. Ajourned. 

HOCSE. The aaaembling of the first regular session of the XLVIIth congress had the effect of drawing to the capitol a vast number of visitors. By 11 o'clock every seat in the gallery of the bouse of representatives was filled. Keifer stood for a short time in the rear of the desk, and waa warmly con gratulated by bis colleague* upon bia success in obtaining the Republican nomination for speaker. At noon Clerk of the House Adams called the body to order and announced the opening of the session. He then proceeded to call the roll. The roll call showed 290 representatives present. There were four member* absent. Nominations for Hpeaker being in order, Mr. Keifer was nut in nomina tion by Robeson,Randall by House, and Ford by Murch, Burrows, of Michigan, Holman, McCook and Ladd were ap pointed tellers. The roll call resulted as follows i Whole number of votes, 285 ; necessary for a choice, 143. For Keifer, 143; Randall, 129; Ford, 8 Those voting for Ford were Br.imm, Borrows (Missouri) Hasleton, Jones (Texas,) Ladd, Mosgrove, Murch and Rice (Missouri ) None of the candi date* voted. Fulkersoo and Paul, Vir ginia Readjust*ra, voted (or Keifer. Tho result having been announced, Keifer was escorted to the speaker's eh air by Messrs. Randall and Hiscock, and took the oath of office, which was administered by Mr. Kelly, of Penn aylvania, as the oldest member in poiot of servioe. The speaker stated that the roll of the house waa completed, and that the next business in order was the election of a clerk. Mr. Robeson, of New Jer sey, nominated Edward McPherson, of Pennsylvania; Mr. House, of Tennes see, George M. Adams, of Kentucky, and Mr. Murch, of Maine, Gilbert De- Lam a tyr, of Indiana. Mr. McPherson was elected by a vote of 148 against 129 for Adams, and 9 for DeLamatyr. On the first roll call Everett, Barr and Bingham did not vote, but on the second they voted for McPberson. Mr. Robeson then offered a resolution for the election of the following officers: Sergeant-el-arras, G. W. IL>oker, of ; door keeper, W. P. Brown ss i >■" j i • f low, of Tennessee j postmaster, Henry Sherwood, of Mlchigen. He eleo In cluded in hie list the name of Fred 8. Power* for chaplain, but Mr. Springer demanded a separate rote upon that officer, and that nomination waa with drawn for the preeent, Mr. House, of Tenneaaee, offered s substitute for Mr. Robeson's resolution to a* to make it read : Sergeant-at arm*. John O. Thompson ; doorkeejer, C. W. Field j postmaster, A. M. C. Nowlin. Mr. Murch, of Maine, offered the following as a substitute: For eergeant at arms. Lee Crandell ; for doorkeeper, 11. M. Williams; for postmaster, W. C. Moore. Mr. Murch'a substitute was rejected by a viw voce vote, and Mr. llouser by a vote of yeas, 153 j nays, 157. The origi nal resolution was then adopted and u!l the officers sworn in. On motion of Mr. Hiacock it was re solved that a committee of three mem bers be ap|>ointed to act with a similar committee on part of tho Senate to wait upon the president and inform him that a quorum of both houses haa assembled and is ready to receive any communication he muy be pleased to' make. Messrs. Hiscock, Orth and Uea* gan were appointed as such committee. Mr. Robeson than offered a resolution for the election of Fred D. Powers, of Virginia, as chaplain. Mr. House moved to substitute the name of W. P. Ilarnisan, of laiuisiann, and Mr. Murch to substitute that of P. 11. lugalls, of lowa, lkith substitutes were rejected and the original resolu tion agreed to. Mr. Power waa sworn in. Mr. Haskell offered a resolution pro viding that the rules of the Forty-sixth Congress shall be the rules of the pres ent house until otherwise ordered ; and further that the committee on rules, when uppointed, shall have leave to report at any time all such amendment# or revision of said rules as it may deem proper. Pending action tho house at 5:25 adjourned. There is nothing now to delay the reading of the president's message when it i received except the swearing in of territorial delegates, which can le accomplished in a short space of time. The Htalwart Revel. From lb* Philadelphia Time*. Senator Cameron appears to have un dertaken the somewhat human task of getting even with all opponents of stalwartism. He settled up some old scores in this Stalest considerable cost during the late campaign. He took one of the Vhird term old guard at Chicago, and with him laid out the Blaine element in the State Convention and over-ride the men who had bolted Ihe stalwart candidate for Senator. Hsving done that he transferred his scene of activity to Washington and haa been using his knife all along the Blaine ranks. The success of Keifer in the Repub lican caucus was a loud notice that the bosses have resumed control of the government, and the further notice has been given that only stalwarts need apply. Kasson or Hiscock would have been named for Speaker if the bosses bad not interferred. But the bosses, from Arthur down, did interfere, and from that moment it was apparent that not only would neither Hiscock nor Kasson have any further chance of sue cesa, but that no candidate from an ear pbatically Blaine State could possibly* hope for favor. Kasson, with the Blaine legions of lowa at his back ; Uncock, with bis Independent following ; Burrows, from the solid Blaine State of Michigan ; Orth. from Indiana, which held a strong force against Grantism, and Ihinnell, of Minnesota, whose State held out till the last; ail these were passed over for a stalwart from Garfield's own State, where neither Blaine nor Grant had any support, but where a stalwart break has finally been made. The bosses will sweep Ohio in under the wing of the administration, because Ohio has twice in National Conventions led up to the defeat of stalwart schemes. . The bosses neglect nothing in the midst of their revels. They are power ful with all the patronage of the (Execu tive, and they have shown their power in forcing a stalwart Speaker upon a caucus which did not want him. Keifer in the chair will he a strength and help to any stalwart plan for 1884, whether it shall mean the nomination of Grant or tba renomination of Arthur. It is one part of the bosses' programme for a complete restoration of stalwartism. It is not the carrying out of Garfield's policy exactly, but ooly the very inno cent expected anything like that. A Battle Between Bird*. HOW A 

CRKBK RAW RID WITH TBI BLOOD or AR lAOLI AMD A FLOCR or (lIMI. UltW Bark LatUr to Um Atlnta Gu*tl lotto*. A gentleman from Stone oounty, who has jut reached the city, gave the par ticular* of a remarkable incident which he witnessed while crossing White rirer on the ferry juat about the mouth of Sycamore creek. When nearly half way acroaa the dream an enormoua eagle awooped down on a (look of geese, which were swimming in the rirer aome eighty roda below the boat. The fowls, upon observing the eagle approaching, inatinctirely dired under the water juat aa the bird arruck the ware. Baffled in the ft nil aa*ault the eagle flew alowly upward, and when the geese came to the surface darted downward again and burying ita Uloona in one of tbetn at tempted to bear it away. The gooae struggled riolently, while ita compan ions twain around it ottering shrill cries and the persona on the ferry-boat watched the atrange scene with keen interest. Once the eagle lifted iu prey clear out of the water and seemed on the point of oonreying It to the moun tain cliff that rose grandly in the air on the other aide of the stream, but the struggles of the goose forced the captor downward. When water was again reached the gooae made a supreme pffbrt and plunged bejpw the surface, dragging the eagle alter it and oausing the Utter to loosen iu hold and rise upward with a fierce scream. The eagle next attacked another goose, hut with the same result, being compelled to relinquish iu hold when ita intended victim plunged beneath the wave*. This strange contest lasted fully thirty minute*, at the end of which time the eagle gave up the fight, and, rising, soared away to the mountain westward, while the flock of geese swam further down the stream. None of the flnok were killed, hut the water in the vicinity was dyed with blood, anil the surface of the stream was covered with feathers for a considerable distance. The Experts and Gulteuu. From the Chicago lotor-Ocawu, A committee of experts are in Wash ington consulting as to the mental con dition of Guiteau. It is understood that they do not agree, and the pros pects is that their evideuce will be quite contradictory. The sensible way to look at the cine in not to weigh the question of the man's mental derangement, but that of his mental responsibility. All men who commit flagrant crimes without seem ing provocation, or indulge in unuHual conduct regarding any of the ntlinr* of life, are, to a greater or less extent, of unbalanced minds. The question is, are they sufficiently so to tie held re sponsible for their acts T The difference between insanity which becomes trre sponsible and mere eccentricity of char acter was pointed out a short time ago in these column*, and may be properly alluded lo again, showing, as it does, the line which divides the two cases, if Guiteau, for instance, believed him self jierfectly competent to be the (ten eral-inCbief of the army h* would un douhledly be called an insufferable ego list, or would be laughed si as a block head, but would hardly be deemed in sane in the sense of being mentallv ir responsible for crime. Many persons during our civil war imagined ibem selves far more competent than Grant or .Sherman lo carry on the war sue cesalully, though without military ex |ierience. Mr. Mo rat Ilalstead, of Cin cignali, then a comi-arutively unknown employe of the Commsrdal, actually wrote a long letter toGenernl llalleck detailing how the campaign in the West should be prosecuted. Halleck, used to such suggestions, merely in dorsed the letter "'llalstead M-, tells how the war should fie carried on." and placed it on file. He didn't tend out and have the Cincinnati editor arrested as a crank for it was plainly a case ol great self-confidence, and not of delir ium. Hut if, instead of fancying that he was ooro|ietent to be the command er-in-chief of our forces, Mr. ilalstead had actually conceived himself to It the commander, then egotism would have passed the boundary and have become insanity ; and 11, while laboring under ibis delirium, be had felt called up >n lo shoot a man as a deserter, aud it had been shown that no malice otherwise existed for the deed, hi* place there after would have been an asylum, not ibe gallows. Precisely so with Guileati. He thought himself competent to fill my position, no matter how exalted, but he never imagined that he actually filled such position when he did not. He was angry and revengeful because the President did not set the value on his services that he himself considered them worth, and he fired the shot, not liecau*e he imagined himself lo be Con sul at Paris, but because be knew that he was not Consul and bad no hope to be. Whatever bis vagaries, therefore, and however much be rosy have overrated his powers, he was plainly resjionsible for tbe murder of tb President, be cause lie knew, first, that it was assassi nation, and secondly, because he do liberately weighed bis grievance and counted it sufficient for the commission of ine crime/y' Tbe talk about being com missioned by the Ihety is shown to lie twaddle which Guiteau himself does not crrait, otherwise be would not ex hibit the craven fear of bodily barm which be hs* constantly shown since bis crime, and which he could not feel were be deluded with the idea that God directed bis aim and would shield him from danger. That the wiineaset should generally agree that the man is of unbalanced mind it not atrange. Indeed, it would be strange if they thought otherwise; nut tbe point ia bis mental responsibili ty for tbe murder, and upon tbia the facta seem strong and conclusive. The Virginia Nenatorshlp. Trouble is brewing in the Kesdiuster ranks. Mabone has had several con lerences recently with tbe Democratic element of the Readjuater*. and last nigbt another conference was held at Mabone's rooms, at which there were no Republicans present or invited. Mabone, it ia understood, will insist upon Riddleberger for Sergeant-at-Arm* of the senate, without regard to what the action of the Virginia Legislature may be relative to Riddleberger's elec tion aa Senator. Tbia be doe* because, if elected, Riddleberger would not take hia seat in the Senate until 1883. Among the Republican Readjuatera there ia much dissatisfaction at Ma hone's stubbornness in this matter, especially aa Riddleberger ia personally obnoxious to many of them. Tbey bave triad in vain to compromise with Mahone by supporting for the Senate from Virginia, and on Tuesday neat they bold a council in Richmond upon tbe subject. Gen. Groner, Ma bone's lieutenant and moneyed man, ia also dissatisfied, and says Riddleberger cannot be elected to the Senate. The Republicans of tbe Readjuatera were considerably agitated last night over the conference between Mebona and the Democrats. A Priest Shot la MaasarbasHt*. Srmmariai.D, Mass., December 4. Father MeCarty, perish priest at Green field, wae shot and scriouslv wounded last evening at the parochial >• idenr-e there by David McMullen. McMul- Sen's wile left him several years ago be cause he treated her badly and bad re cently been acting as housekeeper at tbe priest's residence. He visited her last Monday and urged her to live with him, but she refused. Last night he called upon her again and she still re fused to go with him. He returned three times to tbe priest's bouse, ring ing the bell violently and kicking at the door. Father MeCarty finally came to the door himself and McMullen shot him twice and then ran away. One bell entered the priest's body near the navel and was removed from tbe back. This evening Father MeCarty i* in a dangerous condition and ia reported to be sinking. Perished I'udrr Know Drifts.
