tangle that It does uot scorn possible for them to be settled without engaging Ititssla and Austria and probably Tinkoy In war As a dependency on Turkey llulgarla called upon tho porto for protection when Invaded by Servla That government gave no response and Prlnco Alexander took tho field drovo tho Invading eiioiny from his dominions and was In position to dictate a peace when his suroraln tho cowardly Turkish govcrhmeut which had declined to protect Its do pendencies forbade tho victor ous prlnco to enter Into treaty of peace for lack Of autonomy Austria Intervened In behalf ol tho Servians and threatened to occupy Hulgarla in case Alexander pursued tho retreating Serbs Into Servla Now llussla comes forward and proposes to support Bulgaria even to tbo extent of giving military aid If this news Is true thcro Is no doubt that the llulgarlaus will at onco march Into Scrvia Such n move cannot but bring Austria into tho war It that government keeps Its threat to expel tho llulgarlaus from Ser vla nnd such a combination against Hul garla will bring llussla Into tho conflict Tho only way to keep out of tho trou ble In for Austria to bid down from Its threat or llussla to violate Its promise of assistance to Alexander It Is nothing unusual or unexpected for either of those powers to break faith with Its neighbors but lu this case It seems that the desire Is moio or a pretext of war than Its avoid ance Tho pretext Is easily found and if there Is to bo general war lu tho Dast wo will probably know It In a week or two i i ioir srin run hystem is ah us ed Tho

consequence unscrupulous mar shals aro found encouraging frivolous prosecutions arresting people on petty charges of crime transporting them to distant places for examination for the purpose of earning inlleago and other fees A case appositely Illustrating the truth Of those remaiks occurred a week ago In this state A cowboy at 1ort Heno In tho Indian Territory stole or was charged with stealing n pair of worn out pants worth about twentylive cents A United States marshal from Dallas went after tbo culprit and brought him to Dallas by way of Kansas Twenty witnesses vvero summoned from Texas Indian Territory and Kan sas The prisoner was upon their testimony discharged Tbo government will bavu to pay tho mileage of tho mar shal from Dallas to Fort lteno and back by way of Kansas tho fees of n cloud of witnesses and other fees and costs amounting it Is computed to 1500 nil to convict n man of stealing a pair of fruyedout pants and after nil hu was not convicted And tho end Is not yet for the federal nttorncy caused tho wit nesses to enter In bond for nppearanco at tho next term of tho United States dis trict court to give their evidence before the grand jury Tho case wllf then be retried tbo costs doubled and tho government will pay probably S000 In tho effort to convict a man of appropriat ing L5ceut pair of pants which tho owner would probably have given him for a
