The effort to make Butte a jobbing center which the advent of. new roads coming in here will promote is one that should enlist the energy of the merchants of this city to the utmost. When Eastern centers like Chicago see the immensepossibilities of tbit place os a center from which trade can and will radiate in every direction, it is only a question of time when our merchants will have to adapt themselves to the changed condition or see the busi ness. grasped by more enterprising branches of Eastern firms. The new men wonld figure on smaller profits and more eztensirs trade connections to bring about the same results now attained by s limited field of action at big profits. Tht railroad is a wonderful cbenpeccr of com modities of all kinds, and when this coun try Is reached ky the man y lines projected hither, it is bound to be accompan ed by the same features that bars prevailed else where, a promotion of commercialactirity. Helena has arrogated to herself the claim of being the depot for supplying this Territory. But the time is com ing when Butts will with much more reason bs ablr to make this assertion and prove it. As urged in an interview in yes terday's issue, the great and almost inex haustible ore bodies underlying this camp point to one result—that it will be one of the greatest mining and smelting centers in tbs world. Available bodies of fluxing or.* within access and cheap fool will both con duct- to making this a great smelting point. All these are factors in creating a demand for mining machinery right here, and what more natural than that tbs remainder o! 'he mining camps in the Territory should "cek this city as a market in which to purchase all the supplies needed? The men who are alive to the needs of the times are the men who will profit by the approaching change of existing conditions. The lack of unanimity of feeling that bas in the past so operated against the full de velopment of a spirit of enterprise should become a thing of the past. The merchants of Butte bave consolidated themselves in name in a Board ot Trade. There is no more powerful medium of promoting cohe-1 sioo of purpose and unity of effort I amoag a mercantile community than I thin. II entered into in « spirit of endear I or to use it to the tallest extent as a means K to promote the general welfare it is *11-1'". powerful. If the Board ot Trade of Batte I takes these questions or enlarged opera-| " tions embracing the whole Territory into I r.onsideration, and it the members meet| with regularity aad determine that noth-1 ing that depends upon them individaalJy I end collective—f«r th. « *u I d and collectively for the promotion of the I welters of the city shall be omlttsd—in a | «-..j, se tiirjr unitedly pat their «boulders to tho wheel, the position claimed for Bntte as the jobbing eentersbeisentitled to be by ber sise and situation, will bs an ac complished fact and the trade asd busi ness that will accrue to the city will soon make it one of the wealthiest and most prosperous in the West. is NEEDS OF THE FIREMEN. The volunteer fire department of this city has labored under great disadvantages since its inception, and there ha. h,J « since its inception, and there has been a singular want of consideration £ JT singular want of consideration for the un selfish exertions of its members from the City Council. It is true that it is to the in terest of one citizen as much as another to put out fires as quickly as possible and with the least possible loss. The members of the fire department benefit by the exist ence of their corps just as much as the citi zens at large. But the men who shoulder the responsibility of extinguishing fires wbon they occur in this citv Ho S «ll th! bard .Ori, whan . dli«». «act m.k. tbeir l.bor.

But there are cer I tain duties they have hitherto undertaken ' tain duties they have hitherto undertaken that the city should relieve them of and which every argument of reason or justice should unite in suggesting the pro priety of the city undertaking by employ ing men to attend to it.

Some unprincipled person is backcapping the community in which he lives by spread-. ing among the Territorial prose a tissue of lies concerning the Council Committee's re-1 port upon the water supply. He has taken _ , .. ,, .. 1 ... , cars to omit all mention oi the analysis on which the water consumers base their opin-1 ion of the water from the new supply aöd rings in the graveyard chestnut which the committee do not refer to at ail in their re a. mu i-t , port. The analysis showing that « he water is pure is evidence that thecontamications to which the committee refer in their re-1 port have no effect upon the water and do not reach it. Tho opinion is entertained by somo that the new supply of water is from Basin creek, which disappears oast of the flat, and is a pure mountain stream But whatever the source, it is beyond the reach of doubt that chemical analysis can not lie any mere than figures and ehgmica! analysis has said that the water is pure and uncoutaminated. That being undenia ble, what possible motive can any one bave for sending broadcast statements whjch can only bave a hurtful effect upon this city ? Were they inj .rions only to the Sil yer Bow Water Company the citizens coulr. rest indifferent to the spread of the libel.

The report of tho Secretary of the Treas ury, as condensed by the Associated f rees, is partly on appendix to the President's message. His chief topic, too, is tho sur plus, which he estimates for this year at over sixty-six millions. He sees only three wayB to equalize the receipts and ex penditures of the Government—purchase of the interest-bearing debt; increasing I "LT, increasing j « a « n °al expenditure until it equals the re a I" 7 L . equala tfle re ' or ^t'°n o taxation to the re quirements of the nation's expenses.

Washington, December 6. —The annual report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of i he department during the fiscal year amount to $41,387,165. The estimates for the next fiscal year aggregate $53,338,750, against an appropriation for the current year of $31,055,302. The in crease is caueed by the incorporation of estimates of $22,389,151 lor public works, including river and harbor improvements, the expenditures on this account for the current year amounting to only $1,308, 409. The Secretary says: The estimates for the military establishment are based o.v actual requirements of the service. During recent years the appropriation for transportation of the army has been in adequate to meet the cost thereof, and failure to appropriate funds for that 8'>rv 'ce has caused much embarrassment.

TILLERY INSTRUCTION. Touching Geronimo and his fellow esp fives now confined at Fort Pickens and | Mount Vernon barracks, the report says t hat at this time it is a difficult matter to find for them a permanent home for many reasons.

Under existing laws they can not be taken to the Indian Territory, and „„ tuu luulan iW risory, ana of I oa tbs Northern reservations the climate re-1 iM t nr> e °ld l° r them.

A CLASH OP AUTHORITY. In reference to the pay department of tho army, the report says: There is a frequent clashing of authority between the War and Treasury Departments in regard to payments directed to the former. To the great embarrassment of the disbursing officer, accounts are disallowed. The dis allowance of payments made by ai d un der such authority works great hardship to the distributing officer, ns, on the one hand he is confronted v ith a charge of lisohedieuce, and on the other assuming a liability iorwiiicb either he or his securi ties will be he'd pecuniarily responsible. Fn order to prevent this I recommend that the powers of the respective depart ments bo clearly defined by a legislative act. Copious quotations are made from the report of the Chief of Ordnance rela tive to the success of domestic mauufac Ulc luc BU awii oi domestic mauutac I turers in producing high-grade stee', the advisability of increased appropriations or the 6B PPl r °* ordnance for I experiments with dynamite torpedo guns aud those now in progress with shells charged with high explosives I Gred by means of gunpowder.

Work of the Department and Subjects Calling for Remedial Legislation. Washington, December 6.—The annual report of Attorney-General Garland gives afuil account of the business of the depart ment during tho fiscal year. The number of ordinary suits now pending in the Court of Claims is 1,110 involving the sum of $13,250,000. The number of cases filed under the Bowman actis 1,819 involving about $50,000,000. Petitions filed in the French spoliation cases number 5,660 re presenting 2,486 vessels and about §30, 000,000. During the fiscal year 1,777 civil sujts were terminated; 922 judgments were for defendants, 703 dismissed, 26 ap. peujeti to the Circuit Court pçd H to tb« of to to Here the on of Supreme Court. During the year there were 13,907 criminal prosecutions, mostly for violations oi customs and internai revenue laws. The Attorney-Gencrul calls the attention to suggestions and recommen dations made in his last annual report in ! regard to matters calling,for remedial legi«, lation and again orges the necessity of im mediate action thereon. These subjects are as follows: Fees of marshals in the [ Territories; pay of ieputy marshals; re | vision of fee bill; substitution of the fiscal for the calendar year; protection to civil officers and witnesses; fees of witnesses and jurors; criminal procedure; perjury and juries in tho District ot Columbia. In re [gard to CONFINEMENT AND TREATMENT of United States prisoners, the Attorney General says he is more than ever con vinced of the absolute need of Govern mental penitentiary and reformatory. He also calls attention to the necessity for ad ditional legislation for rt storing aud pre serving court records and makes an argent appeal in behalf of certain charges in the judicial system of the country. The Attor ney-General urges an appropriation for the erection on ground adjacent to the Depart ment of Justice of a suitable building for the accommodation of the Supreme Court and other courts and commissioners of the United States. Hp also asks that Congress provide for furnishing portraits of Judges of the Supreme c ourt to adorn the cham bers of that court. Attention is also in vited to the necessity of extending the juris diction of Fedeia) Courts to crimes com mitted upon American vessels navigating the great lakes. Congress is urged to take some action for the settlement of it. A 900.000 Suit. New York, December 6. —The trial was begun to-day in the United States Circuit Court of two suits in equity brought by the Banque Franco-Egyptienne of Paris and Henry L. Bischolfabeim, of London, against JoLn Crosby Brown and others for about $6,000,000. The suits grew out of the negotiation of tlie New York, Bos ton & Montreal Company. There are a large number of persons inter ested, among them J. W. Se ligman & Co., Brown Bros. I Co., and Duncan, Sherman & Co. The pleadings alone cover over 9,000 printed pages. Elibu Root made the open ing argument. In 1873, the New York, I Boston & Montreal Railway Company is sued $12,250,000 first mortgage bonds, $12,750,000 second mortgage bonds, and $15,000,000 of stock. Bischoffsheim and Goldschmidt, of London, advanced $6, 250,000 of tho first mortgage bonds and they transferred $5.000,0u0 to the French bank.'
