We are certainly triad to wo! come the ojd Athena Font to our cch,n2? Mil" ' It Is now edited by Jo. J. Ivins and the first number under his management Is an excellent baoer. It la, like the Times, all home print. Horses will soon be a thing of the Dast in the cities as horseless ve hicles are proving a great success, Tin best are called Gasoline Mo torcycle!. They are run by gaso line, which in a 'lays solid travel costs Jess than the feed for a horse. T heee has been sonu. talk, in' the paper, about who the republi cans uf this .4 ate would select as U, 8. Senator in the event they should eret control of I he legislature. We are of the opinion that there Is rather large "if" In the way, but we suppose there U no harm iu talking and we 'desire ' to say that C.tpt Win. Rule would be our tlrst and last choice for the ' office were it possible for a republican to get it. It is a cold day and the type ma chines fall to d their duty when the Knox ville Tribune does'nt have a red hot editorial about 11. Clay Evans, or Congressman Henry II. Gibson. Bro. Tatum never hears the name of one of these gentlemen mentioned without taking a severe case of "Jim Jams". We are sorry for our duar brother and hope that by the time the winter (frosts and snuws are over he will be cooled off enough to think with less friction In the grey matter of hU brain. The Times wishes to again caution some of our politic ians and brethern of the press.' Do not let your enthustam run away with your judgment. We believe it will be a serous mi take to ties Ten nessee's chances for the Vice Pres idency to McKtnley's chances for the presidency, or to any other man's chancer, so far as that is concerned, at this early date. Be careful about getting pledged to tiny man as there is time enough yet and no telling what may hap . pen before the convention. There are now states which havn't .twenty-three a democratic congressman, while only four havu't a republican congressman. The four soldiy democratic are Ala bama, Arkansas, Florida and Georgia. Those that do not send a democrat ar; Colorado, Conneticui, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, Kansas, Main, Michi gan, Minniesota, Montana, Nebras ka, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Vermont, Oregon, Rhode Island, (South Dakota, Washington, W.Virginia, Wisconsin and Wy oming. - j The Maryville Times must do some lively hustling tor local news, Junglng from apperaranue. Brother Goddsrd Is shrewd enough to cul tivate most thoroughly that field in w hich the big city daily cannot suc cessiully compete that of heme news. Crossville Chronicle. We regard the above as great a compliinnut as can be passed a country newspaper; for, if we know our business, the county paper should be devoted to its county and every Issue should contain a com plete record of ihe events of the week. This by busting and secur ing live correspondents a paper like the Times can do, but it can not, nor do tho people expect it, to cover the news of the .world. It UU thousands of dollars a year to Nfeure the world's news aud after alt tho average reader ceres very liuio tor !i. What interests us most Is our own, our accqnaiu f -rres Kit-! onr neighbor's welfare. Th" trth t thi? is illustrated by the past for when the Times reach a posl-olttce, the readers at taat place tarn to where they are ftccusitnued to find the news from tlieir community. They read it first, then turn to the neighboring c mimnnities and the last thing tvadiflthe brillaint (?; editorial pae. This is a fact no matter how it goes against we tditors, who i soiretlraes think we are saying) t reat u l wise things and are exer cising a great educating influence In this way.. But the county editor who spends his his time at his desk grinding out editorials calculated to control the destinies of a nttioo, will certainly fail to pleas his readers and will also find that the destinies do not mind him much Together w'th the press gener ally, me rosi reprouturs me k"- lug prevalence of .lynch law; the practice of the press is toindiscilm inately condemn It.

Our sentiments exactly Bro Ivins aud we do not have muh faitli in the expresniona against mob law following such a deed If the writers of such articles should batmen to have the awful crime brought Into,, their imniedi ate family, we do not believe they would stop to consider the Justice or iniustice of mob law. Two very Important facts in con J nectlon with the new era of maga zinea ore illustrated in the Decern ber Cosmopolitan. Its fiction is by Stevenson, the last story writ ten before his death, "Ouida," Sarah (irand, Zangwlll, and the beglt nine of James Lane Allen's new Kentucky realistic story, f'Butter- fl es." Probably no atronger array of fiction has ever been presented iu any magazine money could not buy better. Nor has any magizlne ever had h larger number of really distinguished artists engaged upon the illustration of a fhgle number. The reader might be puzzled to know how such a number can be made at the price of ten cents. But the magazine itself affords the solution. It contains 139 pages of advertising, which, as the publish ers announce, is from $4000 to $8000 more net cash advertising than was ever before printed In any maga zine, of any kind, and In any country. It breaks the world's record in the publishing .business. Moreover, the cost of the artists and authors who appear in this number Is divided amongst 400,000 copies, bringing the cost per copy proportionately low. The Cosmo politan thinks that the ten cent magazine, bringing, as it does, the best in art and literature into all an educational move ment second in Importance only to that of the public schools. jten, as there isn't the slightest It will be an agreeable surprise . probability that Congress will even to persons subject to attacks of consider the retirement of . the bilious colic to leain that prompt 'greenbacks at this time.

In speaking of how he curfd it he says: "I used several kinds of cough syrup but found no relief until I bought a bottle of Chamberlain's Cough Remedy, which relieved me almost iustautly, aud in a short time brought about a complete cure."

In fact, unless the situation is mis understood in Washington, there has got to be a fluht or a backdown, and it is certain that even if the administration wished ' to back down that Congress will not allow it to do so. The Monroe doctrine has always been believed In by the republican party, and the republi cans in Congress can not only be depended upon to stand by the administration in maintaining that doctrine, but to force it to maintain it if such a course be necessary. The only portion of Mr. Cleveland's message that struck a, responsive chord in Congress was that clause dealing with the communication seut to the British government last July demanding a specific answer as to whether it proposed to sub mit to arbitration the disputed boundary line between British Guiana and Venezuela, aud giving notice that this goverment would not allow England to forcibly take any territory claimed by Vene zuela. E gland has answ ered that demand, and although the full text of that answer has not yet been reclved It Is now on the way by mail it Is understood that it con tainer a more or less positive re fusal to arbitrate the dispute. Should that understanding prove correct there is nothing left but to Inform-England that the United States will not allow her to steal Venezuela's territory, and in order to give that Information force it is probable that It will be sent by Congress, which alone has power to declare war, In the shape, of a Joint resolution. . - Mr. Cleveland this week sent for Speaker Reed aud the two held a lengthy conference. It Is notposiliv ly known that the subject of this conference was the Monroe doc trine, but it is believed that It was, and that Mr. Cleveland sent for Mr R-ed in order to ascertain just where the republicans stood and to arrange as to how the matter should be dealt with by Congress. As soon as England's answer is received it will be sent to Congress accompanied by a sptctal message from the President, and if It be of Ihe nature expected England would Just as well prepare , to choose between backing down and r . - v - u "'CB Mr. Cleveland's message, so far asit related to financial matters had just as well never have been writ- latlon for increasing the revenues, was plainly done for the purpose of throwing the responsibility of amending the tariff laws upon the republicans. Th-3 republican party has never shirked a responsibility and It will not do so. Congress will provide in its own way the money needed by the governments and leave the responsibility of ac cepting or vetoing that legislation upon Mr. Cleveland. The republican Senators have held several conferences since Congress met to deal with tne question of reorganizing the Sen ate, aud, although no programe has actually been agreed upon there is little doubt that the republicans will in due time reorganize the Senate. There are not enough re publicans to make a majority, but it is believed that the populist Sen ators, who have agreed to vote together for a time on the organi zation question, will eventually divide and that enough of them will vote with the republicans to make a majority, but no Induce ments' will be offered them to do so. Among the flood of bills Introduced in the House this week was oue presented by Representative John son, of California, which ought to become a law. It provides for the amending of the ) naturalization laws so that no lien shall become a citizen who has not for five years preceedlng his application resided within the United States, and who cannot read, write and speak the Engl'sh language. The application of Senator-elect Dupont, of Deleware, for the seat in the Senate to which he was elected has been referred to the Senate Election committee, and there is little doubt about his getn ting the seat He haa a clear case. Speaker Reed has not announced the House committees, and until he does the House will probably only sit two days a week, as It did this week, unless there shall be some special reason for changing the programe. Mr. Reed hits not set any date, but the impression prevails tlirt the committees will be announced some time next week, or at the latest within ton days.
