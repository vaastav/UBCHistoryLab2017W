INDIANA. 4 nourishing Condition of the DIock-Coal In dustry Heavy Output of the Mlues. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. Brazil, lec 2, The output at the coal mines was, perhaps, neyer so larjte as at present The market has gradually widened until it now embraces a largo field in the Northwest. Two years ago' the celebrated block coal was displaced by gas and oils in the Chicago iron-mills. Thna thrown upon the general market to compete with cheap er grades, this excellent fuel suffered de creased demand, while the bituminous en joyed an increase. Then followed the seven months' strike. Since thentHe block has largely regained its old customers, or found new, until the demand now is quite large. The Ohio and Pennsylvania pools have lost in proportion as the Indiana coals have gained in the Northwestern market. . besides an enlarged market, the fa cilities for mining have greatly im, proved. Now shafts have been sunk, air and, electrical machinery have been introduced, and a small force of men can now turn out more coal than a much larger did two years ago. Throughout the district both block and bituminous every mine is running and operators are advertising for moremen. The State needs two or more inspectors. The present in efficient method will keep the statistics of the industry from the public, while at the same time not affording sufficient protec tion to the miners. t Bloodless Battle of Ballets. pecla! to the Indianapolis Journal.

HUGE SWINDLE THWARTED Kcw York Speculator Commits Forgery in the Hope of Securing 300,000. To Help Out Ilia Scheme lie Identifies the Body of a JSnicideas That of a Wealthy Enclish m&nCase Unraveled by a Reporter. New York, Dec. 2. Perrin II. Sumner, a Broadway real-estate speculator, who gained considerable notoriety with the mysterious suicide of the man who regis tered at the Getty House, Yonkers, as George Smith, was arrested to-day by Captain McLaughlin, charged with forgery. The prisoner, it will be remembered, identi fied the suicide as his friend, James H. Edgar, a wealthy English chemist There was a supposition that the identification was not correct, and was made by Sumner for the purpose of defrauding a life insur ance company. The sequel tends to show that there T'aa a swindle intended, and that Sumner, apparently in the hope of re- alizingtby the scheme the sum of $300,000, did not hesitate to commit forgery. The suicide took place on Oct 27. lhe man passed under the name of George Smith, and bad been stopping at the hotel a number of days before he swallowed the fatal dose of morphine. A few days later Sumner visited the Getty House and identi fied the body, as stated above. He de clared that he did not relieve kdgar had taken his on life, and hinted at foul play. Captain Mangiu, of the lonkers police, ap pealed to Inspector Byrnes, and an investi gation was begun. Dunng the inquiry bumner had stated that he had learned of the alleged suicide from George H. Edgar, a nephew of the de- Ceased. He had the body buried at his own expense, and the authorities began at once a hunt for ueorge H. Edgar, now supposed to be a myth. Sumner, when closely Pressed, showed letters written by James 1. Edgar and his nephews, George 11. Ed gar and Robert Rowe. all of which were de clared by an expert to be in the same hand writing. Sumner, besides, had a rather Bhady reputation. On Nov. 5 he made his reappearance at lonkers, . and to allay suspicions asked for the examination of the body for further identification. When the coflin was disinterred and opened be said to the coroner: "Yes, that is Edgar." Afterwards he said that Edgar was at least five feet ten inches in height. The suicide, Geo. Smith, was measured, and proved to be barely five feet six inches in height. When Sumner heard this be said the man was not Edgar. He exhibited a picture which rosembled the deceased. The police, satisfied that they had thwarted a lifo insurance dwindle. dropped the investigation, and up to the present time tbe identity of the mysterious 'George Smith" has not been discovered.
