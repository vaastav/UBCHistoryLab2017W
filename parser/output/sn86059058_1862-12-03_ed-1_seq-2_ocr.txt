Tic Jhutt ioutmate WEDNESDAY MORNISO. .DKCKBER 3 M. T1IAYKR, Si. SIIVKRTIIOTIN, CeUner. Ae' late. I. A Retrospect. Duriup'tltc nOTith of December find January lust, froom and despondency were feU I'lrougtiout the loyal States. Everything appeared to be at a " dead lock." The rebels held possession of Manassas, Norfolk, Bowling Green, Forts Henry and Donelson, and Colum bus. The Union troojw were hardly holding their own in Missouri, while our grand armies in front of tbe rebels at Manassas and Howling Green, were paralyzed by an inactivity that was equally perplexing and discouraging. The mystery connected with this inac tivity was more annoying than the slug" gishness of those in whose keeping were the destinies of the Republic. It was in the West these dark clouds first began to break away. Commodore Foote's cannon at Fort Henry so disturbed the stagnant atmosphere that the clouds raised, parted, and at Fort Donelson the sun of liberty came ont with resplen dent beauty. Joy filled every patriotic heart. The backbone of the rebellion was considered broken. Victory follow ed victory in quick succession. Bowling Green, Nashville, Columbus, Islaud No. 10, Pea llidge, Shiloh, and New Orleans, were rapidly and triumphantly won by the gallant volunteers from the North west, and people began to talk cheer fully of the close of the war. This an ticipation was strengthened by the suc cesses on the Atlantic coast But then came the reaction. Beaure gard slipped through Halleck's fingers at Corinth. The attack on V'icksburg was a failure. The Mississippi remained closed. McClellan's efforts, backed by the most desperate fighting and cheerful sacrifices by his army, amouuted to no thing. Richmond bid us defiance. Again the rebels assnmed the offensive, and in Virginia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky they steadily pressed back the Federal legions, nntil the feet of rebels pressed free soil. Once again the bloody repulses of Antietam, I'erryville, and Corinth turn the tide against the rebels, and our columns start in pursuit. But another paralysis has come over the Army ef the Potomac, and it lies at Fredericksburg confronted by a power ful and vigilant enemy. It now seems to ns that we must turn our eyes from ths -Potomac if we expect to see anything done within the next two months. It is more -than ever evident that the North west is to tight the battles and save the Government; and we rejoice to see that her columns are again in motion. We expect to hear soon of results accom plished. Her hardy sons, when properly led, take no steps backward. We learn that an important move ment has taken place from Helena. The rivers in that vicinity are rising rapidly, and Gen. Hovey never hesitates to strike when the time comes to admin ister the blow. Gen. Grant is also " mov ing on the enemy's works," with seven days' rations, while Gen. Sherman, with a large force, has gone down the Missis sippi. The rebels at Grenada, Miss., are becoming alarmed, and the Memphis Appeal has already began its prepara tions for a second move. Vicksburg and Jackson will soon be ours. Tennessee will be liberated, and the Cotton States will be'made to feel the terrors of war and drink the cup of rebellion and revo lution to its very dres. Gen. Bragg, it is reported, is making haste to strengthen the hard pressed ar mies of Price and Van Dorn, now under the command of Gen. Joe Johnson. He is alredy at Aberdeen, Mississippi, and we may expect another battle in that State that well exceed the bloody struggle at Shiloh, Tennessee. For some days past, disappointment and dissatisfaction has been written on the faces of our people. But we confi dently look for joy and hope soon to light up their countenances, as they read of other triumphs achieved by their no ble boys in the Mississippi Valley. If thewar does "drag its slow length along," we are confident rebellion will receive fearful aud stunning blows iu the South west This would be poetical justice, for tbe base attempts of the rebels to alienate the affections of the people of the North-west from the Government which baa done so much for them. It will be a fitting return for the insult to our people in proposing to buy their loy alty with a promise of the free naviga tion of the Mississippi. The navigation of the father of waters will le free for succeeding generations; what a noble legacy to bequeath our children that the strong right arms of their fathers made it so. The Capitola, Ida May and Mar mora, all passed up, on their return from transporting sohlii iers to their destina tion on the Father of WtMfl We trout the caster oil expedition will soon bee in to operat". U- The 5f ashville tTnion says the I greatest consternation prevails among the rebel slarftoidrra of Middle f'ennes fcee, as the trine " draweth fcigk " when the Pfctwrcnt's proclamation is to be enforced. However 'that remarkable document may be regarded by the But ternuts in tbe Fret States, the Southern butternuts think ,t other than brutum fulmen. Titey look upon it as the most terrible wound yet inflicted upon the pe culiar institution which, while it is the crvr,sr-kge, hitherto been the main sup port oTthe Butternut Confederacy. The Union asserts as an evidence of this fact that in the counties of Wilson, Williamson, Mauray, Rutherford and Davidson counties, in Middle Tennessee, rebel masters, for two or three weeks past, have been diligently gathering np their slaves and running them South as expeditiously as possibly. The same course has been pursued by the rebels in Virginia, a large portion of which Stale has been entirely cleansed of the black element. Would that it could as easily be purged of traitors! With the Union, we cannot see what particular benefit rebel masters are to derive from this wholesale shipment South of their chattle property. They must have hopes of resisting the onward march of the Union army, or else with a I Mieawber's faith they have sent them ; South with the expectation that some : thing will turn up. In this they will not be disappointed, but it is a something which sends a shudder even through the heart of loyalty. "What that" something" may be is thus energetically stated in the Union: We have our doubts whether these fu gitive masters will find the change for thehetter. It looks to us like leaping out. of the fijhja pan into the fire. What will they do with their slaves when they get them South? There is no work for them to do, no cotton or tobacco to raise, and nothing for them to eat, It does not seem to us that to collect hundreds of thousands of restless, excited negroes together, is exactly the best method of securing and strengthening the divine institution of slavery, which is sanction ed by the Lord's Prayer, and the Sermon on the Mount. To use a plain term, these rebel slave-holders are a set of asses; they never were troubled with much brains, and they have improved very much, of late, the wrong wav. it we wanted to stir up miscniet, m sulordination and the devil generally, in the Cotton States, we would advise these slave owners of Middle Tennessee, to do just as they arc doiir4. Just let tliem pile up their negroes, four deep, over Mississippi and Alabama, until those States look like the deck of a slaver, and leyond all doubt we shall speedily wit ness an irresistible conflict, compared with which all other conflicts will apncr.r JMM and spiritless. Who would have believed, twelve months ago, that during n bloody civil war, the rebel slave own ers, who have always dreaded insurrec tions among their slaves, even when they were separated from each other on isolated plantations, would at the most dangerous period of the war, mans the slaves in one formidable body, and thus render them immeasurably more power ful to inflict injury f This is precisely what the rebels are doing. But we have heard nobody object to their doing so. If they can stand it, we guess that we can endure it, not only patiently but com fortably. In fact, ve confess that we rather like the movement, The rebels are kindly putting their heads so close together that we can soon sever them at one blow, as if they had had but one neck. Nor does it require the gift of prophecy to foretell what will follow in this State. Brutal Murder. By a note from Col. Green, Mail Agent on the Grey Eagle, we learn that a foul murder was commit ted on Saturday last in Daviess county, Kentucky, about five miles from Owens boro. Mr. Willis Fields, who has always been regarded as one of the most upright men in the county, was found dead two ! miles from his house with several stabs in his body, indicating that they had been - inflicted with a large knife. Various suspicions have been aroused I as to the perpetrator or perpetrators of ' this murder, but as yet nothing has oc curred to satisfactorily fix their identity. Mr. Fields is said to have been a ster ling Union man, respecteJ and beloved by all his neighbors. This, however, only makes the murder the more myste rious, Col. Green, thinks, but we do not think so. Nothing can more naturally account for the cowardly taking off of any citizen in Kentucky than the fact that he was a sound Union man. We are ii hope the authors of the murder will be ferreted cut and brought to speedy and condign punishment. Not Mustered Out. Our readers will remember what an important figure " Thompson's Battery " cut in the battle of Shiloh; how gallantly it was served and what fearful huvock it made among the rebels. Capt. Thompson, who so ably com manded the battery on that occasion, ar rived in the city last night, en route for Holly Springs, he having, as we are in formed, been promoted to the rank of Lieut. Col. of artillery, and been assigned to duty with Gen. Grant, as Chief of Ar tillery. The report that the Captain had been mustered ont of the service for absence without leave, was of course erroneous. He hasheeu sick for several months, but is now in excellent health and spirits. For Memfuis. The splendid passen ger and freight packet Forest Queen has her shingle out to-day for Memphis. It looks superfluous to say much in praise 0 so celebrated a packet as the Queen. C:irit Conway is in command, and will 141 immediately on the arrival of the train. "Railroad Accident. A bad smash up occurred on the Terre Haute and Richmond Railroad tn Monday, between the stations of Cortersburg and Plain field. A bridge over a creek a few miles east'of Cartersburg gave way and pre cipitated fifteen cars into the creek. Two men were killed. How many were in jured we did not ascertain; nor the amount of damage done to the cars and their contents. It is not often an accident of this kind occurs on that model road ; so seldom that one is induced to suspicion " foul play " when they do happen. We did intend publishing the ab stract of the President's Message as it came to us last evening in the Indian apolis and Cincinnati papers, but on glancing over it, we are convinced it is a very unsatisfactory summary, and therefore prefer waiting until we can lay the Message in full before our readers, which will be in a day or two at farthest Personal. Yesterday we had the pleasure of grasping the hand of Gen. Veatch, who was on his way home to en joy, with his family, a few days' fur lough. The General bas been quite si 2k and looked considerably the worse for vear; but we are in hope that a short time spent amid the comforts of home will fully restore him to his health, use fulness, and brigade. The army has sufficiently few valuable oibcers that it can spare so good a one as Gen. Veatch any great length of time. For Rent A very desirable residence on Locust Street, between Sixth aud Sev enth streets. The house is well furnished, and supplied with every convenience. Will be rented with or without tbe furni ture. Apply at the residence of Thos. E. Garvin, on First Street. 2td Charles Wimar, a distinguished West ern Artist, died at St. Louis on Sunday night, the 30th ult, of consumption. The deceased, who had already gained a high reputation as a landscape painter, was only 30 years of age. While the weather was cold and cloudy iu the forenoon, it cleared up by 12 o'clock, the sun came out warm and bright, and finished up tbe day in a blaze of genuine spring sunshine. The 25th Regiment Indiana Vol unteers is now located at Davis' Mill, six miles from Lagrange, Tenn. The Belle Creole, a very substan tial packet, is advertised to leave for Memphis to-day. The polite and popu lar Harry McDougal, officiates in the of fice. Mrs. Roland, at the Post Office, has received Harper's Weekly for the pres ent week, and all the latest papers and periodicals. For splendid cartes de visite. or pictures of any sort, go to Elliott's Gal lery, No. 8 Second Street. It was announced a few davs ago that an order had been issued by the mil itary authorities for the arrest of John B. Norman, Esq.. the able editor of tbe New Albany Ledger, for the charge of publishing information calculated to give aid to the enemy. Hearing the rumor, he at once reported himself to General Wright for orders. Now, we are pleased to learn that Mr. Norman has returned home and resumed his editorial duties; from which we infer that he has been deemed not guilty of the charge but we trust that Gen. Wright admonished him not to do so any more. Louisville Jour nal. railroad receipts. Decf.mrf.b 2. 40 pkgs groceries.
