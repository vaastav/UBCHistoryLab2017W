i EST AB L, I S II E 1 iSl?. Editor. A- THE FIiAti AT THE MASTHEAD. From Gov. David B. Hill's Albany Speech. The principle cf Tariff Reform has oxly met witu temporary defeat. soon er or later it will ultimately triumph in this country. president cleveland and the Democratic pautv were right AND 

DESERVED TO SUCCEED. TlSE ARGU MENT WAS WITH US, AND TWO WEEKS' LONGER DISCUSSION WOULD HAVE GIVEN US THE VIC TORY. Permit me to suggest that there MUST BE NO BACK TRACK TAKEN UPON THIS QUESTION. The issue so COURAGEOUSLY PRESENTED BY PRESIDENT CLEVELAND IN" THE INTEREST OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE 

MUST NOT BE ABANDONED. Ol'll FLAG HAS BEEN nailed to the mast and there it must remain. Temporary disaster must not be permitted to discourage us in our UNSELFISH EFFORTS TO RELIEVE THE PEOPLE FROM UNJUST AND UNNECESSARY TAXATION. Temporary expedients will only endan ger OR POSTPONE OUR. FINAL TRIUMPH. LET US STEADFASTLY ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLE of Tariff Reform, and the-clouds that now obscure our pathway will soon pass AWAY. TARIFF REFORM Ml ST COME. "Roger Q. Mills. We must go on without a halt. It is our mission to reduce tariff taxation and remove the burden of th? people. We will continue the fight for tai It! reform until the next Presidential election and then .iijal;i force the issue. It is the duty of the next House of Representatives, if it has a Democratic majority, to pass anoth er tariff bill, and it is the duty of Demo cratic orators and newspapers to educate the people on the iniquity of unnecessary taxation. The Tariff question must be :opt to the front by the Democratic party, whether in victory or defeat, until the fjiirdens of the people are removed. I am convinced that the West, especially, is favorable to tariff reductiou, and that if ti) issue had been raised by Cleveland in his first message and wo had sufficient time to educate the people the result of the prent election would be U liferent. But the defeat of Cleveland, though sincerely co be regretted, will have no effect cn the policy of the party on the tariff question. 'There will be no retreat, but a steady ad vance. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. His message to Congress, read on Mon day, will rank with the ablest of the State papers that have marked President Cleve iand's administration. It is straight lor ward, manly, and bears the impress of i-tatesmatwup. The country will applaud the wise utterances of this wise and patri otic man. If it will heed his notes of warning and follow his counsel,the future of our country will be brighter, safer and happier. G rover Cleveland is stronger to day in the affections and confidence of the people- in defeat than Harrison can ever be in Lis victory. The selfishness that com passed his defeat will yet bring ruin upon us unless the Tariff Revision, urged by Mr. Cleveland, is made the policy of the gov ornmenr. 

LROAH BUILDING IN EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA. The Chowan and Southern, now being built from Tarboro to Norfolk, is expected to be finished by next June and will open up a new ront.1 between Norfolk and Ral eigh. From Raleigh via Sclma, Rocky Mount, Tarboro and Chowan and Southern, svill be five miles farther than present route via Wcldon. When, however, the railroad now halting at Springhope is pushed on to Raleigh (as it must be) this will make the distance from Raleigh to Norfolk by Tarboro fourteen miles shorter than by Weldon. The Halifax and Scotland Neck exten sion if? under construction a3 far as Green ville, and is to be extended next year on to Kington and to Jacksonville in Onslow county. This railroad is crossed seven miles below Scotland Neck by the Chowan and Southern, and a large town is expect ed to spring up at their junction. These roads together, with the railroad now being built from Wiiliamston to Ply mouth, will open up Northeastern North Carolina to the State Capital. The partially constructed railroad from Ridgeway to Petersburg is to be finished. This will put Raleigh forty miles nearer Richmond and all Northern points tban the present route via Weldon and forty nine miies nearer than the route by Dur ham and Oxford lately opened. AX 

EDITOR A LA SULLIVAN. Mr. Joseph P. Caldwell, editor of the Statesville Landmark, has no special fondness for fighting, but, if occasion de mands, he is a tegular John L. Sullivan. A few days ago two brothers of Mr. J. B. Connelly assaulted Mr. Caldwell on the street as he passed their store on his way to dinner. He had on his overcoat. He knocked one of them down and was chas ing the other with a chair when he was caught. lie got a bloody nose and a scratch under the eye. If he whipped two men with his overcoat on what would he have done in his shirt-sleeves? The Chronicle regrets to hear of the difficul ty, but after a while people will learn that editors will defend themselves when at tacked, and it wont he health for the ag gressors. The alleged reason for attacking Mr. Caldwell was a publication that appeared in the Landmark stating that Mr. J. B. Connelly had been presented by the grand jury. - - - i"R friend, Mr. Junius Williams, tells us that a majority of the firms working the turpentine business in Georgia are North Carolinians, aud that a majority cf those North Carolinians are from Samp son, Cumberland and Robeson counties. He also says that every commission busi ness in Savannah is owned by North Caro linians. This fact is simply another ex ample to establish the almost proverbial expression, "North Carolina is a good place to be born in."' It does really seem that our State is the very cradle of suc cessful men. Clinton Caucasian. The Stale Chroniclu. TIIK SHOTWKM, MOM MKNT. The beautiful t-haft to the memory of Capt. Randolph A.

The cost of engraving the inscription, some $200, was raised almost entirely by her efforts. The monument was executed by Mr. Chas. A. Goodwin, Proprietor of the Ral eigh Marble Works. It stands thirteen feet high and is surmounted by a beauti fully wrought urn with elegant drapery. The caps are ornamented with delicately carved oak leaves. On each side of the monument is an appropriate inscription. On the first is a delicately wrought mon ogram consisting of the initials R. A.

RESURGAM." DESERVES WELL OF THE PARTY. From News of Oxford. Among the papers of the State that did brave and noble work in tbe last campaign, the State Chronicle stands in the first rank. Joseplius Daniels, its brilliant and fearless editor.never relaxed his watchful ness and fought the white man's battle to the bitter end. He is an uncompromising foe of negroism and white reuecadeism and deserves wei! cf his party. He is at the State Capital, well equ p-ped for the business, and should succeed himself as State Printer. He did as much towards gaining victory for the Democracy as any o'h. i' uiiTi in the St -to. His time and his purse were ut the disposal of h:S party, and no man surprised him in the march for Democratic victory. To the Chronicle, and the efforts of X. B. Bronghton. isdu" in an eminent degree the defeat of John Nichols. We are for Daniels for State Printer and the Legislature will honor itself by honor ing him. THE II EST DEMOCRATIC IN THE STATE. P A PER From the Franklin Press.) Jo-ep Uiis Daniels, E.-q., will be a candi date before the Legislature for re-election to the office of Public Printer. He has held the pffiee one term and naturally desires an endorsement of his adn.inistratLjn, which has been clean, op n aud honest. He is editor of the best Democratic paper in the State, and is due that much at tbe hands of the party. So far as we have learned he will have no opposition, and a uuanimous re-election would be as graceful as it woeld be deserving. Sam Small spoke recently in New York and he quoted as saing that the idea of the Prohibitionists electing a President anywhere in the near future was a roseate lined delusion The Prohibitionists should be more practical and make the fight on the same line as in Atlanta, Ca. lie also predicted that the Labor movement would be stronger fiv years from now than it is to-day. . . His friends throughout the State were shocked Saturday at the announcement of the sudden death of Judge Thomas Settle, of Greensboro. The absence of the editor postpones until next week an extended ac count of the life and services of thji welb known jurist and statesman. A gentleman tells the Chronicle that he thinks it looks like a great deal of cheek for legislators, who have a free railroad pass in their pockets and draw mileage besides, to talk about passing a law for bidding a Judge to ride on a free pass. 

WHAT ANOTHER NEWSPAPER MAN THINKS. The Argus is glad to learn that Brother Josephus Daniels, of the State Chroni cle, is likely to be re elected State Printer. He has done the work well for the past two years! Moreover, his paper, the State Chronicle ha done splendid ser vice in the recent campaign, always freshj interesting, instructive and bold, it added thousands of votes to the Democratic col umn. Its exposure of John Nichols over a year ago paved the way for the splendid triumph of Btinn and made it possible to redeem the Metropolitan District. For these reasons, among many others, the Argus is for "Joe. DanieU" "first, last and a! u s. CONGRESS MEETS. Vance and Ransom PresentPrp$ideiit'n Message Read. Special Cor. to State Chronicle. Washington, D. C, Dec. 3. Congress met to-day at noon with about three fourths of the House present and all the members of the Senate with the following exceptions: Messrs. Brown, Bowen, Col quitt, Evarts, Farwell, George Hearst, Hi.scock, Beck, Chase, Davis, Jones, Ken na, Morgan, Quay, Reagan, Riddleberger, Standford and Voorhees. Senators Ran som and Vance answered the first roll call. The members of our House delega tion who were absent were Messrs. Sim mons, McClam my and Johnston. At half after twelve, immediately after the roll call, Congress adjourned, while a committee consisting of Senators Morrill and Sauls bury, and Representatives Turner, Holman and O'Neil went to the White House to tell the President they were ready to re ceive his message. At about half after one Mr. Pruden, one of the clerks at the White Hou-e, announced that the message had ar. ived. The Democrats cheered and the Republicans hissed when the part re lating to the tariff and the fisheries was read. Mrs. Cleveland, Mrs. Folsom and several friends were in the Executive Gallery. Mrs. Cleveland looked unusually pretty in a braided suit of brown cloth with a derby hat to match. All the gal leries were crowded to their utmost capac ity including the diplomatic gallery which is seldom full. The first legislative day was occupied entirely in reading the mes sage which was of unusual length. THE 

METHODIST CONFERENCE. A Pleasant Session in a. Most Pleasant Eastern City. Editorial Correspondence. New Berne, N. C, Dec. 4th. The an nual session of the Methodist Episcopal CofVrenee ! b.-iug held in this delightful city. Ti;' at ndance of piv.iehcrs and laymen is large. Bishop Gran berry is pre siding and State Treasurer Donald W. Bain is Secretary of the Conference, is well officered. It ! The Conference is composed of a fine looking body of men. There are men of four-score years who have been in the ministry many years, men in the prime of life, and young men who are just entering the ranks. They have all come up to the ! annual gathering from their fields of labor. Some of them have come up through great tribulation, privation and toil. B'it they are a brave body of men. Tin v a: . ade of the stuff out of which heroe- t. tde They endure hardship as good . ..i iters. They live not for earthly honors. They seek not flowery beds of ease. They are not looking for luxuries for purple and fine linen and sumptuous fare. They are seeking to do good and to serve their Mas ter. Their pay is small and their labors great, but they have put on their Sunday clothes, aud donned their beavers, and are, iu the main, a prosperous-looking set of men. Some of them bear the traces of surTeiings endorsed for the Master's cause, hut they are not rt-tiners nor growlers. A preacher who grumbles at his work could not be better employed than investigating whether or not he was called to preach. The average salary of these preachers is (I quote from memory) a little 'ess than iffjOO. Oa that amount of money they support their families, pay their way to Conference, and move maybe from Hyde to Burke county every two or three years. This leaves a very small amount for the mnvhsse f the necessaries of life- There is no luxury in such living. The fine clothes many of them wear are presented to them; otherwise they would be wearing cheap clothe. I honor the man, who.in renpouseto the call of the Master, leaves all and follows Him, who goes wherever he is sent to preach, aud who receives as pay whatever is given. If that is not dependence upon God for daily bread I do not know what is. Faithful ministers of the gospel! The State and the country cws them a greater debt than is generally imagined. They do more to preserve the peace than all the policemen; to regulate society than all leg islative enactments; to promote temper ance than all prohibitory legislation; to make men's lives pure and turn women's isoirations to high and noble channels than ail eVi combined. They are,through the go-pel they preach, the preservers uoi only cf peace, but the protection likewise of the rights of property. They preach submission to the powers that be, "the rendering unto Caesar the things that he Caihsar'j.1' Everywhere and nowhere more so than in Uorth Carolina is the faithful minister of the gospel locked up to and respected, are, often vene-red. The people appreciate their labors and their sacrifices. Whether it be the Methodist circuit rider, the Baptist missionary, the Presby terian evangelist, or the Episcopalian cler gyman, it is to the true, faithful preach er of the gospel who has done more to brin cifiliation and education to the re mote sections th.n all agencies combined. He goes far ahead of the cchooi tea, her into the unbroken forest. He carries tbe Gospel of Light. He gives the people a desire to know to learn to grow. He is the forerunner of the school and of the newspaper. In America the humble pio neer preacher has been the advance guard of civilisation and of head, as well as heart, culture. la this pioneer work iu the last century the Methodist preacher has been second to none and that ao. counts largely for the members and power of the church. In America the growth and membership of the several churches is proportionate to the pioneer preaching that has been done. The church that first builds in the wilderness is the church that holds the people and is the greatest power. It takes unselfishness to preach the gospel In home mission fields. It takes willingness to "suffer aud be strong." I'd preach in a comfortable church to a city congregation and receive a good salary, is all pleasant enough, but to gi out into the "regions beyond," with no luxuries and small pay, none but consecrated men do this sort of work. In this Conference there are not a few such men. They are the real "leaders" of the Conference they are tie kind of men who have built up the church and who carry forward its interests and enterprises, and they are the men who are most entitled to honor. The business of the body that occupies most of the time is not of general interest. In truth it is the reverse, and is very dry reading. During this session there have been addresses in behalf of mieiious, thb Bible Cause, Paine Institute, Education, and the other objects of the church. These have not been altogether as interesting as usual because there have been fewer dis tinguished ministers from a distance pres ent than usual. But the preachers all say they have been profitable. The preaching has been for edification. The Bishop, who has a two-story braia with a mansard roof, has preached twice once on Thankfigiving day and again on Sunday. He is a scholar and a thinker, and his sermons are strong and able. They are the sermons of a big brained man, who has as good a heart as he has a wise head. He is not magnetic, rather the contrary. He is not eloquent, nor is he ornate. He has little of the imagina tion of Marvin or Hawthorne or Hoge. He is not as popular a preacher as either, but he preaches sermons of such character as to impress his hearers for good, and to give them something to think about, t like his freedom from attempts at elo quence and his simplicity, and his sledge hammer blows. Tbe trial of Rev. J. B. Bobbitt occupied almost an entire week. He was charged with wrong doing in a trade with Mr. L. J. Potter. The case was tried by tbe fol lowing committee: Dr. M. L Wood, chairman; J. J Renn, J. B. Hurley, T. A. Boone, J. C. Hartsell, A. P. Tyer, J. C. Rowe, L. E. Stacy, J. R. Scroggs, J.N. Cole, J. H. Cordon, J. B. Carpenter, L. L. Johnson and S. V. Hoyle. Dr. Bobbitt was ably defended by D. B. Nicholson, Esq., and Rev. L. J. Holden. The prosecution was conducted by Rev. T. J. Cutis and Rev. R- C. Beaman. Af ter a long trial in which much testimony was introduced, he was acquitted. There was much discussion about pre paring an address to be sent out to all the members of the church. It took wide rang; In the course of the discussion, Ref. P. J. Caraway made the following most sensible remarks, li.j-gaid that he thought addresses for the purpose of at-tackin-r Romanism had better be let alone as it would likely bring about controver- ! sies that would create a aemana ior moie work th.nnthe Conference is willing to supply. He thought the proper thing to do was to preach the gospel and the doc trines of the church and try to save souls by the preaching of the word and the love of the gospel. "God is with us in this work and if we cannot by preaching the word and carrying out our discipline save men, there is not much hope in sending out addresses." Raleigh, Greensboro and Winston asked for the next session of the Conference.' It was decided to hold it at Greensboro. One of the best things of the Conference was the address of Rev. J. F. Crowell, President of Trinity College. It was an exhaustive resume of the work of theCol (p0 its prospects its hopes and its needs. President Crowell is a wise, indus trious aud practical man, and will make Trinity a great success if he has the co operation of his church. His remarks were well received, and had weight. I append the list of appointments an nounced by the Bishop. It i3 a great porr oi;e man has to station over 200 preachers. They have to go where he says go or leave the Conference. Their destiuies, in a sense, are in his hands. This great power is unusually w ielded for the good of all. It is a wonder that more mistakes are not made when we consider the magnitude of the task.
