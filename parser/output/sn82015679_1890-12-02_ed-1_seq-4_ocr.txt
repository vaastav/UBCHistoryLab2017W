Of course, Democrats will attack the message, but they cannot sneer at it. It is a remarkably able paper. Stalwakt Republicans will find enough to approve in the President's message. It strikes out from the shoul der. Some people are beginning to find out that Benjamin Harrison is a person who lias ideas and knows how to express them. To the great disgust of the Democrats, no deficit in the federal- revenues is -within the range of possibility during the nest fiscal year. The free-trader in this country and the importer and foreign manufacturer will not like the President's message. They are all of the same kind. A cnANGE of less than 1 per cent in the vote for Congress would put Repub licans in the places of two-thirds of the Democrats elected to the next House. The President recommends the enact ment of a national bankrupt law and an international copyright law. There ' are very strong arguments in favor of both measures. Of the 4,00o,40S,'J0G pieces of matter carried in the mails the last fiscal year o7G',509,lG9 were dead-head, of which '07,141,350 were newspapers, free within the county of publication. The President reminds Congress that the completion of the new census de volves upon it the . duty of making a new apportionment of Representatives. There is no dodging in that. The President says the beet-sugar in dustry has already passed the experi mental stage and is a commercial suc cess. "Why should we not have beet sugar factories in the Indiana natural ga3 belt? ' The President says: "There is no 1 wisdom in the suggestion that the sub ject of tariff revision shall bo opened bctore this law theMcKinley tariff has had a fair trial."' Right you are, Mr. President. Congressman Lodge's bill to regulate- Immigration seems to cover the ground. The passport system, properly managed, ought to weed out undesirable additions to the foreign population of this country. The pearl-button editor of the even ing Democratic organ 6pcaks of the drop in the price of sugar April 1, as a "dull thud." It will be a dull thud and a dead one for those persons who have been lying about the new tariff law. That Indiana Democrat who predicts that tho Democratic House, , when it comes in, will pass a service-pension bill, with an income-tax annex, shows how ridiculous an Indiana Democrat can make himself when he sets himself to tho task. When the able Democratic editor takes his pen in hand to denounce what he calls "the force bill," let him remem ber that, in tho words of the President's message, "its probable effectiveness is evidenced by the character of tho Oppo sition that is mado to it.' A NU.MiiEK of active persons are spend ing a great deal of vitality in condemn ing ' tho administration for making: re- morals in the Pdatollice Department, but the record shows that tho Cleveland regime made 2,02,1 more removals during the year which ended June CO, 1880, than :j: las tho present administration during the year which ended last June. , Both of the Democratic organs of ; this city, tho Seiiui and News, have - characterized the McKinley tariff as a r - prohibitory law, yet the President says: 'The importti at the port of New York ,r for tho first three weeks of November were nearly 8 per cent, greater than for tho same period in 1889, and 29 per cent ,v greater than in tho same period'of 1888." Bismarck relegated to comparative : obscurity by tho succession of a new monarch to tho throne he erected, and Gladstone stranded by a political con vulsion due to causes for which ho is in nowise responsible! It is a striking co incidence that each of theso two, the most eminent figures of pre3ent-day v . history, should have tho cur; of power ' snatched from his lips in old age by cir cumstances purely fortuitous. . The closing feeutenco of the message r hould be cut out and pasted in every Republican member's hat. It reads: "if tho pntfcnt duty is discharged with dili- pence, fidelity and courage, the work of the Fifty-first Congress may be confi dently submitted to the considerate judg ment of the people." Rut if the present duty is neglected tho excellent record of the first fcesaion may be sadly marred, if not obliterated.' THE 

PRESIDENT'S. MESSAGE. President Harrison's second annual message is a perfect compliance with tho provision of the Constitution which requires him to "give to tho Congress information of the state of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge neces sary and expedient." It is a complete presentation of the condition of public aflairs, and deals with some very im portant matters of legislation. At the outset the President calls atten tion to the energy and faithfulness with which all branches of the government have been administered, and invites the closest scrutiny of Congress into every part of it. The collection and disburse ment of more than $450,000,000, without a single case of defalcation, is very convincing proof that the affairs of the government are honestly administered. The review of our foreign relations shows them to be in a highly satisfactory condition. The traditional policy of the government to have friendly relations with all . nations, and entangling alli ances with none, has been admirably maintained. The international confer ences held at Washington hist year have produced good results, and are likely to yield lasting benefits. Our relations with Mexico are becoming so close and important that the President recom mends raising that mission to the first class. Diplomatic correspondence is in progress with China looking to the ad justment of all questions relating to the protection of American citizens in that country. The Samoan treaty is produc ing salutary effects. The new extradi tion treaty with Great Britain is work iugwell. Negotiations are pending with Spain for the enlargement, of trade re lations under the reciprocity provision of the new tariff law. . The pehring sea controversy is . progressing towards a favorable settlement. These are some of tho salientpoints in the review of our foreign relations, which," as a whole, is of unusual interest. . . , The silver law enacted at the last ses sion of Congress has been administered with the purpose of, giving full effect to all its provisions. Its permanent effect on silver values is not yet determined, but for. the present it is exert ing a ; Very beneficial influence on ( business aud ' general values. The suggestion is made that the recent mon etary disturbances in England may cause a revision of foreign opinion in regard' to a bimetallic standard and open the way for tho further progress of silver coinage. Referring to the possibility of establishing a uniform ratio of coinage, the President says: "Our very large supply of gold will, if not lost by im pulsive legislation in the supposed inter est of silver, give .us a position of advantage in promoting a permanent agreement foi free use of silver as a coin metal." This deprecation of "im pulsive legislation in the supposed inter est of silver" niaj' be supposed to include any additional legislation on that subject that would tend to drive gold out of the country. From all that the President says on tho silver question it is evident he thinks it would be wise to await the full development of the results of the present law before venturing any further in the direction of free silver coinage. 'Impulsive legislation" in financial mat ters is very dangerous. ' Tho review of the various department reports is more comprehensive and con tains less repetition and detail than usual. Several important recommen dations made by tho different Leads of departments are 'approved by the President, who, in some instances, adds brief and pointed arguments of his own to those submitted by his secretaries. The review, of the work of the Agricult ural Department and of the productive ness of tho country, including a glance at the business situation, exports and imports, etc., will be read with keen in terest by business men. The two points of greatest interest are the tariff question and the national elec tion law, and on both of these the mes sage gives no uncertain sound. They are handled with a frankness and vigor that bespeak strong conviction, and which cannot fail to. command the ap proval of . all who have the wel- faro and prosperity of the country at heart. It would be impossible to improve on tne PresidentVstylo of dealing with these questions or to epitomize his ad mirably condensed statements. Al though he is known as possessingstrong convictions on both questions, and little apt to bo moved by ephemeral excite ment and popular clamor, it is espe cially gratifying to observe the unflinch ing firmness with which ho maintains tho Republican position. He does not admit for a moment that the result of the recent elections was a verdict against tho McKinley law, which had but just gone into effect and' whose operation was unknown, and he says there is no wisdom in the suggestion that the subject of tariff' revision shall bo opened before the law has had a fair trial. "The misin formation as to tho terms of the act which has been widely disseminated at home and abroad, will,7' says tho Presi dent, "be corrected by experience, and the evil auguries as to its results con founded by the market reports, the savings banks, international trade bal ances, and the general prosperity of our people." There has been no better statement of the case than this, and there could not be. The principle of protection and the McKinley law as its embodiment have had no braver or more effective champion than the Presi dent, and nowhere can there be found in the same space as many strong points in their favor, as are so admirably presented in tho message. It settles tho position of the Republican party and of every person who claims to act within the organization. Tho argument in favor of a national election law has never been as forcibly, concisely and eloquently presented as it in in the concluding paVt of themessngo. The question is discussed from a high plane of patriotism, and there is not tho remotest suggestion of partisanism in anything the President 6ays. His pre sentation of the cause of free and hon est elections is the plea of a patriot for tho preservation of the Republic. He shows that every principle and point embraced in tho pending bill has been embraced in other laws or affirmed by the action of Congress, and that the present question is not "whether wo shall have a federal election law, lor wo now have one and have had for nearly twenty years, but whether we shall have an effective law." The Pres ident insists that the enactment of such a law, absolutely non-partisan and just to all sections, is indispensable to tho preservation of the government; for, as he says, "equality of representation and the parity of the electors must be main tained, or everything that is valuable in our system of government is lost." Other important features of the mes sage will be noticed hereafter. As a whole, we predict that it will receive the enthusiastic approval of Republic ans, and that the most malignant oppo sition will attack it in vain. It is, a very able and a thoroughly admirable .message. - THE 

PRESIDENT ON EECIPE0CITY. That portion of President Harrison's message devoted to the reciprocity clauses of the tariff law will meet with the hearty approval of all who believe that-much can be done by treaties with independent nations to extend trade in those articles which we produce in such abundance as to have a surplus. In deed, no portion of a message which is free from conditional expressions is more emphatic and hopeful than the portion devoted to reciprocity." A num ber of critics have expressed the opinion that the duties should have been re tained on sugar and other articles until the treaties for a free exchange had been agreed to by the . gov ernments whose peoples will be benefited by our free list; but President Harrison takes the other side, and gives the most cogent reasons why the policy of the present law is wiser than the other could be. The statement that those countries of which we pur chase sugar and coffee fully appreciate the advantages we have extended and are ready to reciprocate affords ground for .encouragement. Fortunately the President's advisers are devoted to the policy of reciprocity, and no efforts will bo wanting to carry into successful operation a policy which is so popular and promises so much for agricultural and other interests. It is, in a cer tain sense, the good fortune of the Republican party that its opponents have discovered that reciprocity is sim ply an extension of the protective idea, and have declared against it. Their eff usive support might have em barrassed those who are chiefly responsi ble for it. As it is, real reciprocity is as much a Republican policy as is protec tion. 

DISQUALIFIED CRITICS. Washington specials announce that Representative Oates, of Alabama, will present, at an early day, a bill imposing a tax upon all incomes of $10,000 a year and upwards. He Is moved to do this because of the Republican prodigality in regard to pensions, and because, as ho asserts, the people of the South pay 850,000,000 into the Treasury where they draw $1,000,000 out. The bill is aimed at the pension expenditures, and is de signed to add to the hostility which Democrats and mugwumps in the South and East are inciting against the present pension system. The authors of the present system, so far as it relates to the late war, are Republicans, aud they have no apology to make therefor, because they appreciate the services of tho men who derive the benefits of the laws. But, if they were inclined to seek justi fication outside of the rightfulness of tho claims of the Union veteran upon the gratitude of the Nation, they could find it in the pension law so long urged by Democrats of the South and finally enacted, and approved by Mr. Cleve land. Referenco is made to the Mexi can pension law. As long ago as 1877 the Southern leaders were agitating the matter. Their first measure was a sweeping service pension bill which would have put the name of every man on the pension rolls who enlisted in the Mexican war, provided his name was on the rolls sixty days. They made a bit ter fight to retain to Jefferson Davis that privilege, and nearly every Dem ocrat who was in the Senate when the measure reached that body voted against a proposition to exclude him. Failing in this, they finally secured the passage of a compromise measure, which puts upon the pension rolls all Mexican veterans at that time under sixty two years of age, if in need, and all, regardless of their circumstances, who had reached the age of sixty- two years, no matter if they had, subsequent to the Mexican war, served in the confederate army. That bill Mr. Cleveland made a law by his approval. If the Eastern mugwump and Cleveland newspapers, which are now assailing the present pension laws, had any objection to that measure, which is vastly more .sweeping in its benefits than any law relating to Union pensioners, they did not express it. After the passage of such a measure, which would pension as many men who had been in the confederate army as were not, it wasvery natural that Union veterans and their friends should demand similar recognition. They did demand, and were denied at that time, but the justice of itmade them more importunate. The present disabil ity act is the result, and because of its provisions the Southern Democracy and Eastern mugwump papers cry out against it. Since the election a num ber of Northern Democratic papers had the courage to express their long-time hostility to the Union sol dieis by denouncing them as pension grabbers. And yet, under the present laws, the confederate who was a Mex ican veteran has advantage over the Union veteran, since, if sixty-two years of age, he is a pensioner, while tho Union veteran of that ago is denied the boon. It is submitted, in all fairness, that the Southern Democrats, Mr. Cleveland and his Northern organs that are denounc ing the present laws pensioning Union veteraus and stigmatizing those of them who seek pensions as mercenaries, are. on the grounds of consistency, estopped from all criticism by the Mexican pen sion law, for which they are responsi ble. If the provisions of that law ap plied to Union veterans at least fifty thousand of the lOC.OOOwho are now over sixty-two years cf age would to-day be pensioners. M 

DISTRIBUTION OF PENSIONS. Time and again have the Democratic anti-pension papers declared that more pensions were granted in Indiana, ac cording to the number of men in the service, than in any other State, the pur pose being to Inake abasisforthe charge that pensions are granted in this State to influence voters and not because the applicants were entitled thereto by the rules ot the bureau. The loiiowmg table, showing the number of soldiers furnished, the percentage of losses, and pensioners, from official sources, shows the falsity of such assumptions: : c no 2 S.2 J3 O " 2 e 2 o t o s o E3 O 2 STATES. 09 01 New York......

The in crease in the pension agency which pays pensioners in Missouri and Kansas, neither of which is a doubtful State, is fully as large as in Indiana. ' No official figures can help those persons who are assailing the integrity of the adjustment of pension applications in the Pension Bureau. POSTAL TELEORAPHB AND SAVINGS BANKS. Two points in the able and exhaustive report of the Postmaster-general are entitled to more than passing notice. The first, if not the, most important, of these is his recommendation regarding a postal telegraph, which seems not to be generally understood. . Briefly stated, Mr. Wanamaker'splan is for the govern ment to contract with existing telegraph companies to send' messages at rates fixed by it, all of which, except 2 cents amessage for collecting and distributing, shall go to the companies. It is not pro posed to have the government hire an operator or buy an . instrument, much less lease a line. The plan removes all the objections which, have been raised against previous propositions for a postal telegraph which involved the ownership of lines and the working of them by tho government. There is reason to believe that the present charges of telegraph companies, though much less than they were years ago, prevent the more general use of the tele-. graph, and '.that viCsi benefits would be widely extended if the cost of transmission could be reduced. As a matter of course one of the objects of the Postmaster-general in proposing this plan indeed, the main object is to secure much lower charges for telegraph service. If that can be done, and no burden therefor is imposed upon the people, the. plan of Mr. Wana maker commends itself. The subject is attracting moro attention as years pass and tho public come to realize the ad vantages of telegraphic communication, and the number of people favoring and even demanding government control of telegraph is increasing. ' Another subject which the Postmaster general discusses as a business man of capacity and experience is the estab-. lishment of savings banks at postoffices. This matter has been urged upon Con gress for several years. The regular savings institutions which will receive deposits of small savings are confined to the larger towns in a few of the older States. In tho greater part of the coun try there is not an institution which will receivo small savings, chiefly because it will pay no responsible person to attend to such limited business. The Postmaster general says that places for the deposit of savings should be within an hours walk of the home of every workiugman. It cannot be doubted that much of the thrift and economy in tho manufactur ing towns of Newv England and New York are due to the saviugs bank. Ev ery government of importance has pos- tal savings banks. Mr. Wanamaker sug gests that such banks be provided for in States which have no adequate savings- bank system, so that there shall be one , bank for every ten miles of area; that the Secretary of the Treasury shall es tablish tho rate of interest to be paid to depositors; that all postal savings re ceived within the State shall be placed on deposit with the national banks therein, on application, in such amounts and at such interest as the Secretary of . the Treasury shall prescribe, and that 6uch deposits shall be preferred claims against the banks. This seems a very practicable 6cheme. The depositors would have entire security; their money, would always be available, and the ag-r gregate of savings would be put into circulation - again in the community where the deposits are made. 1 The President's message discloses, for the first time, the fact that Mr. Mizuer,iate minister to Guatemala, has been recalled. This was made neces sary by the minister's action in order ing the surrender of General Barrundia from a United States vessel, where ho had taken refuge, and which was the immediate cause of tho Iatter's death. The minister's act was so plainly in ex cess of his authority that the President disavowed it and ordered his recall. 0 The main facts have been known for some time, and the minister's recall was expected, but has not been publicly an nounced before. ' ,v The President makes an unanswerable argument in favor of the McKinley cus toms administrative law when, he says "its chief aim is to securo honest valua tions of all dutiable merchandise and to make these valuations uniform at all ports of entry." The government has lost millions of dollars by the lack of such a law, and honest importers have been placed at a great disadvantage by dishon est ones. No foreign government has a right to regard the law as unfriendly, for, as the President says, "if any duty is supposed to be excessive let tho com plaint be lodged there. It will surely not be claimed by any well-disposed people that a remedy may be sought and allowed in a system of Quasi-smuggling." 

OEMS FROM THE MES3AQE. During the fast presidential campaign General Harrison became famous for his aptness of expression and his faculty of condensing an argument into a happy phrase or a short sentence. Ilismes age sent to Congress yesterday con tains many illustrations of this, a few of which are given below: The misinformation as to the terms of the tariti act which has been widely dissem inated at home ard abroad, will be cor rected by experience, and the evil auguries as to its results confounded by the market reports, the savings banks, international trade balances and the general prosperity of our people. . Our policies are adopted not to the hurt of others, but to secure for ourselves those advantages that fairly grow out of our fa vored position as a nation. Our form of Bovernment, with .its inci dent of universal suflrago, makes it im perative that we shall save our working people from the, agitations. and distresses which scant work and wages, that leave no margin for comfort, always beget We are - under no disadvantage in any foreign market except that we pay our workmen and workwomen better wages than are paid elsewhere better abstractly, better relatively to the cost of the neces saries of life. I do not doubt that a very largely in creased foreign trade is accessible to us without bartering either our home market for such products of the farm and shop as our own people can supply, or the wages of our working people. Equality of representation and the par ity of the electors must be maintained, or everything that is valuable in our system of government is lost The qualifications of an elector must be sought in the law, not in the opinions, prejudices or fears of any class, however powerful. . . The path of the elector to the ballot-box roast be free from the ambush of fear and the enticements of fraud; the count so true and open that none shall gainsay it Nor should it be forgotten that every law, whether relating to elections or to any other subject, whether enacted by the State or by the Nation, has force behind it The courts, the marshal or constable, the posse comitatus, the prison, are all and always behind the law. No community can afford to have it known. that the officers who are charged with the preservation of the public peace and the restraint of the criminal classes are themselves the product of fraud or vio lence. The floods of lawlessness cannot be leveed and made to run in one channel. The kill ing of a United States marshal' carrying a writ of arrest for an election offense is full of prompting and suggestion to men who are pursued by a city marshal for a crime against life or property. No choice is left to me but to enforce with vigor all laws intended to secure to the citizen his constitutional rights, and to recommend that the inadequacies of such laws be promptly amended. It is passing strange that the able and industrious Democratic correspondents at Washington f who discovered the great bond scheme that Secretary Win--dom didn't contemplate, the numerous cases of "coolness" that didn't exist be tween Republican leaders, and all the various resignations of officials who didn't resign, never stumbled upon the fact that Minister Mizner had been re called. Some of these days the news papers will feel the need of having a few facts from Washington, and will send a few common, every-day ' report ers down there and get them. The professional friends of the Indian are now saying that a,, failure to apply civil-service reform rules to the Indian service is the cause of much of the trou ble on the reservations, frequent changes of officials being demoralizing to the red men. They ought to have thought of this when they- were urging President Cleveland to remove Agent McGilli cuddy from the Pine Ridge reservation. McGillicuddy is acknowledged by all who know anything about the matter to have been the most trustworthy and best qualified agent ever in tho service. TnE President nqtes with pleasure tftat the receipts from internal revenue were nearly $12,000,000 greater last year than they were the year before, while the cost of collecting was $90,617 less. The per centage of cost of collecting the customs revenue was less last year than ever be fore. It is remarkable what disagreeable and amateurish methods most suicides resort to. Blowing one's brains out, cutting one's throat in bungling fashion, swallowing poison that causes hours of writhing agony or leaping out of a high window to make an unsightly mess on the sidewalk below any of these is extremely shocking to the .sensibilities of friends and relatives. It may be pleaded in extenuation that most of these people act upon sadden impulse. and their methods are perforce hasty aud .ill considered; but, though this may be justly adduced as a cause, it can hardly be accepted as an apology. There is no rea sonable excuse for baste iij suicide. It is about the moat important act of the sui cide's life, and as it ia not likely to conflict with any subsequent engagements, he has all pie time there is in which to perform it. Mb.

I notice," said an English Gladstonian now in New York, "that people here speak of the short remnant of Gladstone's life.'

I would not be surprised if the tree-chopper of Hawarden should be a leader in imperial politics till the close of the nineteenth century." When1 the late August Belmont (whose Gallicized name, by the way, was in his mother tongue Schonberg) was a clerk in the Kothschilds house at Frankfort the manager came to him one day and said: "We want some one to go immediately to New York. Will you go, and if so, when will you be ready?" Said Mr. Belmont, without hesitation: 4T will go, and I will be ready to start to-morrow." He started within twenty-four hours, and he owed bis great fortune to that quick decision. TllHpubliCjWill not be surprised at the news that the yonng Emperor of Germany has fallen out with his mother.

Although Mr. Shillaber was intimately associated with the name "Mrs. Parting ton," he was not its originator. It is re called by a contributor to the Boston Tost that this humorous designation dates back to Sydjiey Smith, who used it in an anec dote in a speech delivered bv him at Tauu- tou, England, in 1S3L His reference was to a certain Mrs. Partington, of Sidruouth. who, at the time of the trreat storm and high tide of 1821, tried to pu.sh back the At lantic ocean with a mop. It was applied, also, as Mr. Lowell mentions In one of his essays, to Lord Hartmgton. the present Liberal-Union political leader in England, by Abraham Lincoln, at the time his Lord ship wore a confederate badge at some entertainment in WaHhingtou during "the civil war. Mr. Lincolu assumed to un oerstand that Hartington's name was Par tington, and with humorous gravity ad dressed him by it.

A New York; banking-house sent word to the President that it would not subscribe to the securities while a Southern man remained at the head of the Treasury 1 Apartment.

PRESIDENT AND HIS CRITICS. The Administration Is Patriotic and ECcieht and Marked Ij Crave Statesmanship. Knoxvllle (Teun.) Journal. It is too much, perhaps, to expect any thing iike fair treatment of a President of the United States on the part of his polit ical opponents. George Washington did not receive it, nor has any one who has since occupied the White House. The crit icism of one PresidcLthas been about as se vere as that of another. The merits of all of them are ignored and kept in obscurity, while their demerits, whether reap or im aginary, are magnified and exaggerated A gram of virtue is so completely lost sijjnt of in the mass of chaff and downright false hood thrown about it by the enemies of tho President that a foreigner who reads the opposition press would conclude' that in the United states our President is our very worst citizen. President Harrison is not an exception. The shafts of calumny fall thick and fast oboutliim, and if judged bj' what bis ene mies say the conclusion could hardly be escaped that he must either be a fool or a knave. No man ever occupied the White House who has been more persistently mis represented, nud maligned, and slandered than President Harrison. IZ is a fact that no purer man has ever held that high office, aud none worthier of the confidence and co-operation of the good people of the country. As a soldier, as a private citizen, as a lawer, as a Christian man. and as a statesman, he combines in a striking de gree the virtues of tho highest type of American citizenship. Siuce entering the W hite House he bassteadily maintained his high character, and even his virtues have been sneered at by his unscrupulous and supercilious critics. In his religions devo tions ho has been held up as a modern PecksnitT, and his ailection for his chil dren and bis grandchildren is made the occasion for coarse cartoons and coarser alleged wit. This has been carried to an extent that is absolutely disgraceful to the Ahicricau press, and it is worthy onlv of tho extreme execration of all good, fair minded, patriotic people. It is a shame to the whole Nation. . But asidH from all this discraceful pry ing into the privacy of his household, judged alone 'by his official acts. President Harrison is entitled to the conlideuce and the support of his countrymen. He hat been governed by purely patriotic consid erations from the moment be delivered his inaugural address and took the oath of office down to the present hour. It will not be insisted by his friends that his ad ministration has been free from mistakes; but even these have been small, and none of them of such a character as to injuriously atlect the countr-. The first year he was in office his time was taken np very largely by office-seekers. This was not his fault and in bestowing patronage, if he made a few mistakes, it is nothing more than has been done by his predecessors. Whenever he has been called to act upon publ c questions, his acts have been char acteiized by brave statesmanship. It can be asserted, without dancer of successful contradiction, that tbo relations between the United States and the states of South America have become more satisfactory uuder this administration than ever before in the history of the country. Under this administration the large surplus in tho treasury, which was considered as a men ace to our financial stability, has been util ized in a way that the common sense of the Keoplewill approve, and the public debt as been very largely reduced. His enemies and those ot his party, sore under the easy solution of what they chose to -believe a vexatious problem, have assumed tat the close of the fiscal year would reveal a def icit in the treasury; but this is only an assumption which will soon be exploded by facts. The affairs of tho government, so far as they could be controlled by the executive department, have been managed carefully, honestly and efficiently. The President and his Cabinet officers have made a record from the closest scrutiny of which they will not shrink, and which their friends will find no cause to defend. It is an ad ministration which will stand the tests of comparison and investigation, and which will till an honorable page in the history of American administration. If the Presi dent goes on as he has begun, when hit term expires his countrymen will say well done, thou good and faithful servant of a free people. Conscious of his honesty of purpose and of bis fidelity to principle, the President can afford to pass by. lightly, the ill-natured and utterly unfair, treatment accorded by bis carping critics. Washington bad tt em, and Lincoln and Grant. Harder things have been said about all these than have been said about President Harrison. And yet the country sees and universally ac knowledges that they were great, wise, pa triotic chief, magistrates. Criticism, however unfair, and unjust, and malevolent it may be, is harmless wheu it is not well founded. In the case of President Harrison it is with out foundation, and, therefore, does not barm bim. Tho mists of passion and preju dice may darken for a day, but they will 6oon disappear. Fruitful Cause of Trouble. Helena (Mont.) JournaL Editor Gordon, of the Yellowstone Jcur nal, rises to remark that if the white men who sold whisky to Indians were in tho J penitentiary few uprisings and little law essness would be reported among the red wards of the Nation, or words to that effect. And it is true. In Montana there has never been an Indian outbreak which could not be traced directly to liquor among the In dians, and strange as it may be, not three) of the whisky-sellers have been punished in the past ten years. While the Messiah craze is largely responsible for the present Hrouble, which is being exaggerated, the outrages so far committed were performed by drunken Indians. .With these facts in view it will be strange if the government does not make an example of some of the venders of liquor along the lines of the reservations. i; I'itUburc' Harrow nei.
