Ward, New York, Brook lyn, Philadelphia and Chicago. Chance for Heydler. Heydler's stock took a sudden boom this afternoon when it became known the National league by-laws had receiv ed an Important amendment. Finding themselves deadlocked over the elec tion of a president, the members yes terday voted that in the event of a va cancy in the presidency the directors be empowered to name a president to act until the league members Should have a chance to elect. Since three of the five directors are Heydler men it is evident that if the meeting proves hopelessly locked, Heydler might be chosen to hold the office indefinitely. Grow More ' Hitter. j As the day wore on prospects of a break in the deadlock over the presi I dency of the National league did not improve. Statements of some of the magnates made it look as if ach side were more bitter than ever.

' f'ollapue Is Sudden. Brussels, Dec. 17. King Leopold died at 2:35 o'clock this morning. His aged and wasted body was un able longer to stand the strain put up on it. The collapse came suddenly and at a moment when the doctors seem ingly had had the greatest hopes for his recovery. King LeopoTl's recent illness dated from about two weeks ago, when ha was compelled to take to his bed, suf fering with rheumatism. It was thought at the time that he had a stroke of apoplexy, for he was paralyzed on one side, and the paralysis seemingly spread over the entire body. An intes tinal obstruction developed, for which an operation was performed on Tues day. Crown Passes to Jfephew.

Attorney General Stead prefaced his argument before the judges of the supreme court in the suit to compel the Illinois Cen tral to account for 7 per cent of its gross receipts from charter lines here today with a statement of the case by which the state of Illinois seeks to re cover approximately $20,000,000 from the railroads. Sold Land for 830.000,000. The attorney general showed the state had given the company 2,595,000 acres of land as a right of way, and he claimed this had been sold by the road for $30,000,000, which was more than sufficient to build the road. "The claim now made by the Illinois claimed, was absolutely a contract by which the state was to receive not less than 7 per cent of the gross receipts and that the company furnish the state copies of a detailed account of its re ceipts. Since 1S77 this accounting was not kept satisfactorily to tho state. The lines of the company have bef-n extended until now there are 4,377 miles, and upon all this mileage the state claims a pro rata share. Itrldare Earnings Held Bark. Another point made by counsel for the statf was that in the matter of bridge earnings at Cairo and Dubuque the Btate Is entitled to at least $7,000, 000 more than it has received.

Married to Baroness Vinghan. Chief interest in the city last night centered in the newspaper stories of the marriage of tlje king1 and Baroness Vaughan. It will be recalled that their marriage was reported and as often denied, but the statement now Is as cribed to the clergyman who adminis tered extreme unction to Leopold. This is regarded by most people as settling thffflfstion. The clergyman is quot ed as saying: . . .

Magnates of the National league were apparently in a complete deadlock today when they met again to select a president of the organization, and Charles W. Murphy, president cf the Chicago club, asserted his readiness to sit all winter, if necessary, to elect Ward. New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and j Brooklyn presented today an un broken front for Ward, while Cincin nati, Pittsburg, Boston and St. Louis seek to elect Brown of Louisville, or some compromise candidate. (lurry, the Old Foi. The move of Garry Herrmann in bringing forward the name of Brown j-esterday instead of Heydler when the first formal ballot was taken was regarded- today as an extremely strategic one inasmuch as it assured Herrmann and his friends the abso lute support of Stanley Robinson, who favored Brown. Herrmann is now in position to offer the name of Heydler as a compromise candidate. AVHl Take fare of Heydler. Herrmann said today: "You know as much about the election as I do. I think it a shame that a good man like Heydler should .be thrown out of a Job or, if he is thrown out, not taken care of. The present situation is extremely ridiculous because we cannot elect a board of directors un til we have elected a president." Herrmann said he proposed to look after Heydler. in case he was not elected. Only One Ballot Taken. ' The magnates went into session at noon yesterday and - were busy for hours before the matter was brought to a vote.
