No Amrihti for Summer, Schurz, Tipton asp Trumbull.?In the caucus of republican Senators yesterday it is said that Vicc President elect Wilson favored the policy of granting amnesty to the liberal republican Senators, but other Senators would not listen to this propo sition. Henry M. Stanley writes to the committee of invitation accepting the dinner tendered him by the journalists here, and appointing January 11 as the time most convenient to him. A meet ing of the general committee ao<l oi the corres pondeuts generally is called at the oflice of Mr. Ki.owtton, "Newt-paper Bow," next Friday night to complete the arrangements. There was no caucus of republican Sen ators this morning; the committee of tive ap pointed yesterday to rearrange the statu ling committees ol the Senate not having completed thtir work. They will probably be ready to re port to moi row. The Senate adjourned to-day without transacting any business, on aceouutoi the committees not yet being designated. Sou bed by defeat at home, Mr. ltepresenta tive Roosevelt seems disposed to vent his spite against the District of Columbia during his brief stay in Congress. An original capital mover, it is not strange that he should note with dissatisfaction the evidences of progress au<l improvement here, which have destroyed the hope of reviving that project. Transjer of Naval Officers Lieut. Geo. E. Ide ordered to the receiving ship Ver mont; Commander 1>. L. Braine detached as a member of the board of inspection and placed on waiting orders; Lieut. B. l'.Gainberton from the California and ordered to proceed home and wait order*; Lieut. Commander Yates Stirling detached from the receiving whip Independence and ordered to the California. Though the Senate caucus has not yet taken detinite action, it seems to be the opinion that it will be decldcd to put the republican Senator* who did rot vote for Grant upon the same foot ing a> democratic Senators. That i.?, the demo cratic and liberal republican Senators will be allowed to settle among themselves who shall be designated to the minority representation ou the committees. Illness of Mu. Si mmku.?Senator Sumner was seized with a rather sharp attack of his complaint (heart disease) while on his way from Prof. Tyndall's lecture to the street cars, and suttered" a good deal last night. His friends have warmly urged his cessation from all his Senatorial labors, but be was iti his sent to-day at the opening of the session, evidently deter mined "to die in harness." District Improvements of Government Property Gov. Cooke and the members of the Board of Public Works will be heard by the^ House committee on appropriations to-morrow. In relerence to being reimbursed for expendi tures made in improving streets adjaceut to government property. The District committee ot tbe House will also be present, to become ac quainted with the nature aud extent ol the improvements made. MilO.L Prudbh , for many years a clerk in the Judge Advocate General's office, has been detailed tor duty at the Executive Mansion. The statement that Mr. Levi P. Luckey has been promoted as assistant to Gen. Babcock is a mistake. Mr. Luckey is assistant private secretary to the President, and will continue to occupy that position, simply changing his pres ent quarters to the room adjoining the Presi dent's office, occupied by Gen. Babcock. The report of the southern claims commis sion covers some 2,200 cases, of which about 500 are from Virginia. The amount claimed is the 2,200 cases is about *4,600,000, of which some ?*0,0->0 is allowed, and the rest-about ja,* 0,000? U rejected. They have abont fifteen thousand claims yet to decide and report, in which the di*proj>ortion between the amounts claimed and allowed is expected to be as great and probably greater. What Postmasters May Not Do At torney General Williams has decided, in answer to a communication from the Postmaster Gene ral, that post office officials have no right to oi>en or detain letters or other matters trans mitted through the post office, though they may know that they contain obscene matter. The Attorney General adds that postmasters hive no more authority to open letters (other than those addressed to themselves) thau any other Citizen of the United States. Death of Mr. J. B. Batous.?We regret to announce the death last evening in this city of John Heading Briggs, stationery clerk or the House of Bepresentatlves. Mr. Briggs was well and favorably kaown in this community, and bis death will be generally deplored. He was torty-seven years of age, and In early life was a journalist. Hi* dying request was that his body should be taken to Chicago for Interment. Mrs. Briggs, ("Olivia") a well-known Washington correspondent of the Philadelphia Preti, was the wire of the deceased. Tn Ofeiifg Lecture by Prof. Tyndall last night, on "Light," drew to Lincoln Hall one of the largest and most select audiences ever gathered In this city. For once Mr. 8um fter'was drawn from his scholarly chamber, to assiat In the reception of tbe disUagnished Eng lish scientist. - Professor Henry occupied a seat on the platform, and the lecture-room fairly bristled with notables In various walks of life. A report of the lecture lacking the aid of the brilliant illustrations fails to give any adequate idea of its spirit, and we advise all who can find seats or standing room to avail themselves of the opportunity to attend the course. Tbi District im Congress Mr. Harris, of Va., introduced in tbe House to-day a biil to authorize the Washington, Cincinnati, and St. Louis Railroad company to extend their road Into tbe District of Columbia to terminate a* any point they may please. Thts road was in corporated bv the Virginia Legislature in March last, Referred U> District Committee. Mr. Potter, of K. Y., introduced in the House to-day a bill in relation to the sale and dispo sition or the lands and estates of infants in the District of Columbia. It provides that when ever it shall appear satisfactorily to the Suprenis Court of tbe District of Columbia, or to auy judge thereof, that a dispositiou of any part ot tbe real estate located witbiu the territory of said District, and owned bv any iafaut, or in which such intant ehail have interest, in any terns foV years U neceatary or p-oper, either for fie support an;1 ni iintt nance of -"lcb infint.or for hiy or her cdncation; or that the iatere>t of such infant require*. or will be si:b<t inti%! y promoted by such ?'ifjo ition on ac.*< U"?t of acv I art of hi* orbtr sa d i>ropurtv bcitig e\^o?ed to waste and dilapidation, or on ace ant of it* being vr' o'.lv unproductive, or for any other peculiar rea.-ons or circarn?tanc ?s, cuCi cwrt or judge may ord'r and decree thd letting for a U"m of years, the sale, or other dispo* tion ot ^uchreal estate or interest tj b^mide by the guardian or guardian." of such iniants to be ap l?,in ed by s%lil court or judge for that purp>se. in such maii e~ andwith such restrictions a* slial'. by said court or ju lj.e. be damned expedi ent.

EVIPKSCK IS THS COL RT8 OF THE DiSTBTCT. ?In the House to-day, Mr. Potter, of New York, introduced a bill in relation to evidence in the courts of the District of Columbia. It probities that all \vills, t??timent? an.I codicil conceriiiug lamb, tenements or hereditaments in the I>i8trict of Columbia which have hereto fore been, or may hereafter be, duly admitted to probate in said District, may be read in evi dence in atiy suit therein concerning^u^h lands, tenements, or hereditaments from the record ot such probate, and without further proof of exe tion, provided that such record shall be only prima facie evidence of the execution of said wills, testaments and codicils. Referred to the Jndiciarv Committee. Bcnmtora t'eaton and Rumnrr on the Death of Mr. Vreeley. If Mr. Cameron, who moved that the Senate adjourn yesterday, had withdrawn that m>tton in accordance with the request of Mr. Fenton, the latter Senator would have said; -'I desire to leave for New York at one o'clock, and there fore venture upon the indulgence of the Senate to make a motion at this time. It has reteren -e to the great bereavement we all so deeply feel in the death of Horace Greeley. This sad event touches the hearts of all our people. Not on'.y tn our land, but the struggling and the good in all lands, of whatever rank or condition will unite in deep and long lament over his death. In further public recognition ot an event so im pressive, of a grief so universal and profound, I move that when the Senate adjourn to-day. it adjourn to meet on Thursday next. I may remark that several Senators desire to attend the funeral, and it is semI-officially announced that the President and Vice President of the United States will leave for New York to-day for the same purpose. Mr.Sumner weuld have said: "Mr. President, I have been requested to second this motion. One word, if you please. A funeral will take place to-morrow on which the eyesof the nation will rb^t, while innumerable hearts 'lirob with grief and the people everywhere learn the insta bility of life and the commandment of charity. It is proper, therefore, for the representatives of the nation to suspend labor, that thev too may be penetrated by the lessonoi the day. More tor them than the illustrious dead is this needed. He is gone beyond any earthly call; we remain. Duties are always tor the "living, and now, standing at tie open grave of Horace Greeley, we are admonished to forget the strite of party, and to remember only truth, country ami man kind, to which bis honest lite was devoted. In other days the horse and armor of the departed chieftain have been buried in the grave where he reposed. So. too, may we bury the ani mosities, if not the badges, of the past. Then, indeed, will there be victory for the dead, which all will share."' Tbk Meeting ok the Massachusetts Sk>atobi*.?At Canal street Mr. Wilson got into an omnibus. A gentleman who sat next to the door assisted him in getting in. Senator Wilson did not know at tirst who it wa?, when he suddenly heard a voice?" Hallo, Wiinon!" It was the gentleman who had helped him in. Senator Wilson looked at him, and, beaming in a smile, said: "Hallo, Sumner!" TUe two friends shook hands cordially. ''Well, 1 declare, this in a surprise," said the next vice president. 4 Well, old bov, how are you'."' the eloquent champion of Horace Greeley at-ked. "I'm very well, old boy; how are you?" Senator Wilson re turned, still shaking his friend's hand. Sena tor Sumner said he was pretty well; indeed he was very well. His health had greatly lm S roved. "Yes, you look a great deal better," enator Wilson said, delighted; "the trip to Europe has done you good. You look a great deal better. And now tell me all about Euro;?e.'' Senator Sumner told him everything?every thing he told the Herald reporter the day be fore. At the city ball the two friends got out and went to the Tribune office, where they ha 1 another good long talk.

TBf pan, dated November 8, one of the very last that Mr. Greeley wrote, he expresses great gratitude to Mr. Tappan for going into tho recent contest in his behalf with such zeal; ao 1 says in bis gravely jocular manner: "I !.v. been so bitterly assailed that I hardly know whether 1 was runuing for the Presidency or tor the penitentiary." Mr. Greeley thus speak'of tbe death of his wife: "In the darkest hour mv long-suffering wife left, not too -?K>n, a? she ha 1 suffered too deeply and long. I laid her in the r ave with hard, dry eyes. Well, I am used up. have slept little for weeks, and mv eyes are bard to cloce, while they mmid open again.''

Thb Lowdok Press oh the President's Mbssaqk.?The l<ondon papers of yesterday all publ sh the President's message, and generally speak in complimentary terms of it. The TIiu-js says "the message of President Grant is a sen sible, unpretending, lucid and business-like document, which canuot well be abridged. It challenges no special remarks or adverse criti cism. There is an entire freedom from all political or sectional bitterness of partisan spirit. The tone is catholic and kindly, and Its recom mendations are broadly national and patriotic.'* JossrHIKK Makskikld Impoverished.?It is stated that a gentlemen recently arrived from Paris says that the notorious Josephine Mansfield appeared in that city seme weeks ago. She had about $37 000 in money. This she deposited in the banking house of Rowles Bro> When the failureof that house was announced she wrung her hands in grief, and declared tint she was ruined.
