Dpmiicriiiic in 1'oliticH If ex-Presiclcnt Taft was as popular as a president as he is a private citizen, he mifcht have received a few more votes at the last election. Over in Quay County the democrats are still discussing the pro and con advisability of adopting the primary plan. Better get up to date folks. The eastern New Mexico coun ties, including Curry, adopted it long ago. The indications are that can didates for county office in Curry county are going to be as thick next year as flies in the summer time. The man that is elected to office next year is going to have to show a clean record and be qualified to hold the position to which he aspires.

Many people have already begun their holiday shopping and in doing so will prevent being caught in the last jam. If you know any news, tell us about it or phone it to the News office.

The Clovis News enjoys hav ing the largest circulation of any paper in the county, even if it did cost us a piano to get it. The advertisers get a greater circulation service at the same price which should be some in ducement for many to use more freely of printers ink. We are glad it is ours once more to greet our readers with a bright and merry Christmas. It seems out yestercsay mat we sent a like message to you, and yet a year has flown by. May your homes be bright, the dear children of your household happy and the great wish and hope of your hearts in abundant measure be realized this Christmas tide. The editors wife was sick, so he called the doctor. The doctor took her temperature by keeping a thermometer over her tongue for over a minute. "Say Doc," said the editor, "what is that machine and what will you take for it?" "Its a themometer," said the doctor, but why do vou ask such a question?" "Its the longest time her tongue has been still since we were married and I want to buy one," saiu the editor. President Wilson's message to congress is an able document. He deals with the delicate situ ations that have arisen since the great war in a most commend able manner. His advocacy of preparedness, which is the core of the argument, is timely and correct. The United States is the undefended treasure land and any one of the great European countries now en gaged in war could land a larpe army of trained troops and prob ably take this country on short notice. The Monroe doctrine is just as strong as our navy and the time has arrived to be either prepared to defend it in case of necessity or abandon it as an obsolete policy. The oldest busines establish ment in Clovis is the Clovis News. It was printed and cir culated among the farmers that then inhabited this section of the country before there was a a single house on the present townsite. It was then called the Clovis News although the postolfice was known as Riley and there was no postoffiee of Clovis for several months afrer. Though young in years, the two oldest residents of Clovis are the News manager and C. V. b'tted. Notice For Publication. Non coal land. Department of the Inferior. 11. S. Land Ofllea at Fort Sumnoi.
