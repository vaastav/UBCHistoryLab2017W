Thereupon Allegretto, a former captain of the Cuban troops, got Into an excited argu ment with the manager of the theater, nnd was escorted to tho sidewalk by the police on duty. There Allegretto entered into a heated discussion with a Spanish officer, who struok bim acmes the face with the flat of his sword. Then there wns a collision between the Cubans and Spanish military men, more blows wore struok on both sides, and many parsOM from tbt* cafes and park cheered for Spain and brought crowds of people to tho spot from ad jacent streets and squares. Suddenly a shot was fired, whether by a Cuban or by a Spaniard, inten- ; tionally or accidentally, cannot be said, ' and tho Cubans retieated into tho Ho tel Ingleterra. More shots were filed on both sides, and Art tiro, n French i citizen, born in Unv.urn. Was shot and i seriously wounded while Bitting at a table.

He held that the principle bad been sustained by the supreme court in various deotßions, and that no publio r man of prominence and no recognised '. tribunal bad ever been reckless enougb | to oontrovert it.

FILES HER PROTEST. Spain Accepts the Consequences 111- Naturedly. Madrid, Dec. 18.—Tho government entiroly approves the memorandum of protest against the action of the United States commissioners, tiled by Senor Montero Kioa, at Paris. The memorandum protests against the refusal of the Americans to surren der the securities deposited in the treas uries of Cuba and Porto Rico by private Spaniards, remarking tbat "never has a civilized nation committed suoh au aot of violence." Secondly, it protests against the ulti matum demanding tbe Philippines. Thirdly, it protests against the posi tion in which those Spaniards are placed wbo desire to remain in Culm. Fourthly, it protests against the ref erence to the destruction of the Maine in President 1.1 eKinicy's message to emigres:!. On tbis point tlie memoran dum says: "Spain has proposed arbitration, but the United States has refused to givo ber the right wbioh is granted to a criminal; namely, the right of defend ing herself. The Spanish commission ers leave the care of fixing the responsi bility for the explosion to the entire world, which will say whether those are responsible who desire the truth, or those infusing to seek it." The newspapers generally express re lief at the signing of the treaty. The independent organs, most of the provin cial papers and the Carlist and repub lican journals attack both political par ties, conservative and libeial, reproa :h --ing them equally with having brought the country to the pieseut pass. Ul Imparcial alone publishes the contents of tiie treuty, which produces a less unfavorable impression than had been expected, owing to tbe commercial and other concessions to Spain. Xl Liberal says: "The Paris negotia-fc*. tions offer a far sadder spectacle than the ships which are bringing back our repatriated soldiers, deplorable as the condition of the latter is." Several members of tlie United States commission were inclined at flrst to publish the text of the treaty, bnt Sen ator Frye made a strong plea yesterday for the observance of courtesy toward the United States senate, and hia ar guments prevailed. Further details, however, have been learned as to the wording of the treaty, which provides that Cuba is to be re linquished and that Potto Rich and the Philippines are to be ceded. The Americans are to pay for the repatria tion of the Spanish tioops from all tbe colonies. The Spaniards are to return all prisoners held by them. They are to retain possession of all military stores and munitions of war in the Philippines, and of such ships as have not been captuted. Tlie commercial treaties between the two nations, which the war ruptured, are to be lenewed at the convenience of tlie two nations. Arrowsmith. 111., Dec. 10.—Tha private bank of Taylor & Met;line waa laat night entered by robbers, who se cured $4,000 worth of negotiable paper aad escaped.
