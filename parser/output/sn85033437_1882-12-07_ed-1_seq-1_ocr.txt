Pkesidext Arthur's message is commented on with more favor thau any Presidential Message i if our day. RtpublicaES and Democrats unite in praising it The stalwarts are satibfied and the liberals are en couraged. It is emphatically the Message of the President of the People, and not the president of any party. The Message lifts Arthur out of the mud of partisanship and puts him on the rock of statesmanship. An era of good feeling is springs ing up in this Congressional District, again. We rejoice to see it That man is not a true friend of our party who does or says anything to keep the old wounds open. Let us all unite in a determination to frown down all who continue to throw fuel on the fires of factional hate. We want peace, and want a great deal of it. We want Republicans to dwell together in harmony. The able Democratic editors are now discussing whether there shall be caucussing or no caucussing when the Solons meet. Some of the discussers are cau cussers acd some are non-caucussers. The discussers who are caucnssers will engage in caucussing to bring over the non-caucussers. And the discussers who are non caucussers will engage in caucussing in order to concuss the caucussers out of caucussing. Hence there is great danger that the concussing of the discussing caucussing and non-caucussing cau cussers and nonscaucussers will re suit in some little caucussing with out the cau, and some little discuss ing without the dis, and some little concussing without the con. More About Star Route Trials. Washington, December 5. The preliminary examination of William Dickson, foreman of the last Star Route jury, began today. There are two charges one of attempting to improperly influence the Star Route jury, and one of conspiracy to illegal y obtain money Irom the United States. The government was repiesented by H. H. Wells. Nearly all of the members of the last Sur Route jury were present. Several of the jurors testified to Dick-on reading in the jury room his now famous statement, in which he asserted that he had been &y proached by agents of tuo govern ment A copy of this paper was put in evidence. The defense interposed stienuous objection to the aimiubion of the copy and demanded the pro duction of the original, but aittr Judge Snell admitted the copy, the defendant's attorney held up a paper "wcich they said was the original document and which they meant to make use of themselves. Assistant District Attorney Moore, who identi fied and attested the copy of this paper, stated that he had sealed up the riginal and sent it with other decuments in the case to the office of Attorney General Brewster, and haa not heard of it since until the assertion of defendant's counsel to day The jurors who testified to Dickson's reading his paper, stated that it hadno influence in shaping the verJict, meaning thereby that those wno voted against the conviction had their minds already made up in dependently of the evidence, and no weight was attached to DickBon's suuenient by the other jurors. One ox these discredited Dickson's asser tions at the time he first heard them, whereupon Dicksoa "hoped Al--ghty God might strike him dead u the story was not true." The counsel for the defense made no effort to controvert the charge that Dickson had read the paper as charged, nor dispute that the effect of Dickson's action was to vitiate any verdict which might have been arrived at, but held that the charge at issue in the present trial was a corrupt purpose on the part of Dickson.

CONGRESSIONAL. SENATE. Wasington, December 5. The President, pro tern., submitted a communication from the Secretary of the Treasury, transmitting the re port of the National Board of Health. Referred to the cdmmittee on epi demic diseases. Senator Sherman presented a pe tition of the citizens of Ohio for the passage of a bill to increase the pensions to those who had lost an arm or leg in the service. Senator Ingalls presented several similar petitions from citizens of Kansas. Bills were introduced as fols lows: By Senator Anthony : To prohibit the use of the capitol for other than the legitimate purposes. Referred to the committee on public buildings and grounds. Senator Edmonds offered a resoi lution instructing the committee on judiciary to inquire and report by bill, or otherwise, whether any furthet legislation is necessary to secure the title of the United States to the National Soldier's Cemctry at Arlington. He explained that this was made necessary by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in re lation to the rights of General Lee, The resolution was unanimously agreed to. At the close of the morning hour, Senator Piatt called up his resolu tion offered yesterday, askings the Commissioner of Pensions to furn ish certain information in reference to the pension roll and the probable effect upon it of the passage of the pending bill to increase the pensions uf persons who have lost an arm or leg in the service or are suffering from equivolent disabilities. Senator Beck moved to amend by further instructing the commissioner without delaying, the information culled for in the resolution to trans mit, and also as soon as practicable comp.ete the list of all persons borne on the pension roll and claimants for pensions, with their addresses and the amounts of their pensions, respectively, adopted. The resolution as amended by Senator Beck was then adopted. At one o'clock the special order bill to establish a nniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States was taken up. Senator Ingalls proceeded, at great length; to explain and advo-. cate the bill. He reviewed briefly the three general bankruptcy laws heretofore enacted in this country, which, he said, were, in the foremost part, slavish copies of preceding English legislation, and costly and unsatisfactory in practice, ine main point to be considered in framing a bankrupt law was whether the court or creditors should control the dis tribution of the estate. At the con elusion of his remarks Senator In galls submitted certain minor amend ments agreed upon by the sub-corns mittee, which were ordered printed. The bill was debated by Senators Edmunds, Hoar and Garland, and then went over as unfinished busi ness, and the Senate then took up the calendar and passed several bids. The Senate held an executive ses sion, which lasted only a few min utes, and in which nothing was done except to refer to the appropriate committees the nominations received to-day. At 4 p. m. tue Senate adjourned. 

HOUSE. Washington, December 6. Mr. Willis, of Kentucky, offered a reso lution directing the committee on civil service reform to inquire whether, at the recent Congressional election money was raised by as sessment, or otherwise, from Federal officeholders or employes for eleo tion purposes; and, if so, by whom and what amount was raised, and how the same was collected and ex pended; and whether such assess ment was not in violation of the law; also whether any Federal officeholder or employe has been dismissed or threatened with dismissal or de privation of any right or privilege oy reason of his refusal to pay any assessment made upon .him, or was otherwise interferred with. Mr. Kasson objected to the pres ent consideration of the resolution, and it was referred to the committee on civil service reform. Mr. : Cress well, cf Wisconsin, offered a resolution authorizing the committee on appropriations to em body in the postofiice appropriation KNOXVILLE, bill a clause reducing letter postage to two cents. Adopted. Mr. Kellogg, chairman of the com mittee on ways and means, offered a resolution for the distribution of the President's message, and the House proceeded, in. committee of the whole, to the consideration. A resolution was amended so that the question of the Hawaiian treaty was referred to the committee on foreign affairs, instead of to that on ways and meanp. The res lution' was then reported back to the House and adopted as amended. The House then at 1:15 went into committee of the whole, Mr. Waite, of Connecticut, in the chair, on the state of the Union. The first bill to be considered was one refunding to the State of Geor gia the sum of $35,000 expended by that State for the common defense in 1777. Mr. Holman opposed the bill, and its passage was advocated by . Mr. Turner and Mr. Blount, of Georgia, who contended that the claim was a just and equitable one. Mr. Hiscock, of New York, moved to strike out the enacting clause, stating that he was opposed to any bill 100 years old. - Mr. Speer, of Georgia, conceded that the claim was an old one, but none the less a just claim, and re peated actions of committees of the House and Senate had attested its justice. This great government, he said, could not afford to plead statue of limitations. Mr. Singleton, of Illinois, in quired whether, as a legal proposi tion, the Federal treasury had not been discharged from any obligation to that of Georgia by reason of that State going into the rebellion. Mr. Speer replied that he did not think so. Mr. Turner, of Georgia, gave a detailed history of the claim, which he argued was of such a character that it Bhould have been paid upon presentation. After some discussion upon a point of order, the committee de cided that the motion to strike out the enacting clause was debatable. Mr. Terner, of Georgia, was Bur prised that within a few" years from the celebration, of the centennial anniversary of pie Declaration of Independence, Congress should be asked to refuse to pay to any State a just claim for expenditures made in securing that independence. Mr. Singleton, of Illinois, said that he was opposed, on general principles, to bringing the exhumed claims of a century, before Congress. It seemed to him that there was something in the idea that though Georgia had aided in creating the Union, she had also attempted to destroy it, and that though she' had expended money in securing the Union, she had relinquished all claim upon the treasury by with drawing from the Union. Mr. Ray, of New York, member of the committee on claims, which re ported the measure, stated that the committee had been unanimous in favor of the claim. , For one, he would never vote to reject the claim of any State which he believed to be just and honest, notwithstanding that the statute of limitations ought to run against it. Mr. Hiscock, of New York, read an act of Congress providing that the revolutionary claims of the States must be prtsented and settled prior to 1788. If Con gress proposed to take any action in this case it should open the doors and allow all of the accounts be tween the States and the general government to be reopened. - Mr. Blount, of Georgia, contended that there were precedents for the payment of revolutionary claims of States. He said that the reason for Georgia eing tardy in asking for payment was that sue was careful that no unjust claim should be pre sented. Mr. Hewitt, of New York, said that the claim of Georgia would probably have been audited and al lowed pryor to 1788, had 6he not been careful to see that no unjust claim should be brought forward. The question was whether Georgia should be punished for exercising that care. He failed to find, after a good deal of research, the prece dents referred to by the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Blount, But he had found that the government had settled Revolutionary claims of in dividuals. He contended that Con gress should do as much justice to a State as to an individual. Mr. Hammond, of Georgia, thought that it did not comport with the dignity of the great United States to plead the statute of limitation against a claim which was indis putably just and honest. Mr. Holman, of Indiana, argued that the debt of the people of Geor gia to the United States for direct taxation should be made a set-off against the present claim of that State. Mr. Blount regretted that the gentleman from Indiana (Holman) alone should see fit to revive this old tax question, when the people of the North had provided that the tax should not be collected. Mr. McLlain, of Matyland thought that when the gentleman from Indi ana had been addressing himself to the equites of the case, it might have occurred to him that if the State of Georgia were compelled to pay any portion of the direct tax and other Southern States were not, it would be bad equity. Southern had not been called on to pay war tax and never would be. - Another objection to the bill was that presented by the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Singleton, and was to the effect that having gone out of the Union, Georgia had forfeited her claim to the money paid to the Union during the Revolutionary War If there was any one point well settled in law and American itatemanship, it 

TENK: THURSDAY was that no State ever did go out of the Union. . After further discussion the com mittee . refused, 51 to 76, to strike out the enacting clause. The bill was then reported to the House and it was passed ; yeas 96, nays 80. Mr. Steele, of Indiana, offered a resolution directing the committee on civil service reform to inquire how much money was collected by the campaign managers of Demo cratic party from the Cobden Club and from the Free Trade Club for use in the election of 1882. "Let it be adopted," cried several Democrats, but Mr. Kasson objected to its present consideration for the same reason which prompted him to object to Mr. Willis' resolution this morning, that the committee had at present as much work before it as it4 could accomplish. Mr, Townsend, of Illinois, called attention to the fact that objec tion came from the Republican side, and then the resolution was re ferred. Mr. Kasson presented the vi ws of the minority of the committee on ways and means on the internal rev enue bill. They were ordered printed. The minority report is signed by Messrs. Kasson, DunnelL McKintry, Haskell, Morrison and Russell. They are of the opinion that so long as it remains necessary to collect any . portion of the revenue of the government from in ternal taxation. The two sources which can best support imposition of tax are distilled spirits and to bacco. Messrs. Dunnell and Haskell also filed a supplemental minority re port in which they favor the aboli tion of all internal revenue taxes except those on malt and spirituous liquors, tobacco, snuff and cigars. Adjourned. s

Is Alum Poisonous I Dr. Hall's Journal of Health, in a recent issue, saj s. "This question has caused a good deal of discussion. Alum is used by many bakers to whiten their bread, enabling them to use an inferior flour. It is more extensively em ployed as a cheap substitute for cream of tartar in . the manufacture of baking powders. It has not been considered immediately wangerous; although if continued it induces dys pepsia and obstinate constipation. But the fact that many cases of pois oning have occurred from baking powders which contained alum, puts the question in a more serious aspect, and prudent people will exer cise caution in the selection of baking powders. "Under what conditions, then, doeB this, substance formerly used only for mechanical or medical pur poses become poisonous f They are certainly obscure, and at present we can only surmise what they may be. We suspect that the cause ex ists in the individual poisoned; some peculiarity of the constitution pro ducing a morbid change in the secre tions of the stomach, with which the alum combines and forms an active poison; or the secretions may be healthy but in unusual proportions, and that these less or greater pro portions, in combination with the alum, constitute a poison. "For example, two parts of mer cury aad two parts of chlorine form calomel, which is not poisonous; but change the proportions to one part of mercury and two parts of chlo rine, and we get corrosive subline, which is a deadly poison. "Then, again, we know nothing of the causes of constitutional peculi arities. Why is it that one person can eat ad kinds of green fruits and vegetables with impunity, while the same course might cost another in dividual his life f One person can handle poison ivy and sumac without being in the least affected; another is poisoned if he approaches to with in ten feet of them. Out of a family residing in a malarial district, some of the members will suffer half the year with fever and ague, while the others will enjoy excellent health during the entire year. Foods that are wholesome to some pers sons are actually poisonous to others. This is especially true of some kinds of fish. There is no safety in taking alum into the stomach, as it is shown to be always injurious, and of ten dangerous. Bak ing powders properly, compounded, and containing pure cream of tartar instead of alum, are more convenient than yeast; and bread and pastry made with them are just as whole some, and far more palatable. We are in entire sympathy with the manufacturers of the Royal Baking Powder who commenced and are vigorously conducting the war against the use of alum in baking powders. "Before committing ourselves, however, we made tests of a suffi cient numb r of baking powders to satisfy ourselves that the substitu tion of alum for cream of tartar in their composition has not been over estimated, while a careful examination of the Royal Baking Powders con firms our belief that Dr. Mott, the Government Chemist, when he sin gled out and commended this pow der for its wholesomeness, did it wholly in the interests of the public. "We do not hesitate to say that the Royal Baking Powder people de serve the gratitude of the communi ty whom they are endeavoring to protect.
