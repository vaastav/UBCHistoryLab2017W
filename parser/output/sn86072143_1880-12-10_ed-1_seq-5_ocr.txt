I congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity of our country. I!y the faxor of Uic Divine Provi dence we have lcen Messed, during tLc past yxar, with health, with abundant harvests, xxith profitable employment for all our peo ple, and with contentment at home, and with peace ard friendship with other -Nations. The occurrence of the twenty-fymtli elec tion of Chief Magistrate has afforded an other opportunity to the people of the United States to exhibit to the world a signihcani example of the peaceful and safe transmis sion of the ower and authority of gov ernment from the public servants w hose terms of office are about to expire, to their newly-chosen successors. This example cannot fail to impress profoundly, thought ful people of other countries with the advan tages xxhich ltepubiican institutions afford. The immediate, general, and cheerful acqui escence of all good citizens, in the result of the election, gives gratifying assurance to our country, and to its friends throughout the world, that a government based on the free consent of m intelligent and patriotic people possesses clement of strength, stabil ity, and permanency not found in any other torm of government. THE EI ECTUE FKANCHIsE AT THE hOlTII. Continued opposition to the full aud free enjoyment of Ike rights of citizenship, con ferred upon the colored jieoplc by the recent amendments to the Constitution, still pre vails in several of the late slave-holding States. It has, perhaps, not Iieen manifested in the recent election to any large extent in acts of violencu or intimidation. It has, however, by fraudulent practices in connec tion with the ballots, xxith the regulations as to the places and manner of voting, and with counting, returning, and canvassing the votes cast, been successful in defeating the exercise of the right preservative of all right, the right of suffrage, which the Con stitution expressly confers upon our enfran chised citizens. It is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor in our politics should disappear. They pre fer that no section of the country should le united in solid opposition to any other sec tion. The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to tne equal-rights amendments to the Constitution, is all tliat now stands in the way of a cxmiplelcoblitera tion of sectional lines iu our political con tests. As long as cither of these amendments is flagrantly violated or disregarded, it is safe to assume that the people who placed them in the Constitution, as emlmdying the legitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believe them to le wie and neces sary, will continue toad together, and to insist that thy shall bcobf-yed. The para mount question still is, as to the enjoyment of the right by every American citizen who has the requisite qualification, to freely cast his vote and to have it honestly counted. With this questii n rightly settled, the coun try will lie relieved of the contentions of the past; bygones will indeed be bygones ; and political and party issues with respect to economy and efficiency of administration, internal improvements, the tariff, domestic taxation, education, finance, and other im portant subjects, will then receive their full bhare of attention ; but resistance to and nullification of the results of thuwar, will unite together in resolute inirnnse for their support all who maintain the authority of the Government and thu perpetuity of the Union, and who adequately appreciate the value of the victory achieved. This deter mination proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the pople of our country, or to any of their interest. The inviolability oi me amendments rests upon the fundamental principle of our Govern ment. They am the solemn expression of he will of the people of the United States. The sentiment that the constitutional rights of all our citizens must I e maintained.docs not grow weaker. It will continue to control the Gocrumc nt of the country. Hannilv. the history of the Lite t lection shows that in many parts of the country where opposition in me ut u i inn uiiHiminrni nas iirreioiore nrcvailed. it is diminishim and is likclv to cease altogether, if firm and w ell considc red action is taken by Congress. I trust the jlou3c oi Kc-preecntatives and thu .senate, which have the right to judge of the elec tions, return", and qualifications of their oxx n members, will see to it that every case oi violation oi me ictte r or spirit of the lit tecnlh amendment is thoroughly investiirat. c d, and that no Ik m fit from such violation hall accrue to any iktsoii or party. It will lie the duty of the Executive, with sufllcicnt appropriations fur the puriiose, to prosecute unsparingly all who have Wen engaged in depriving citiens of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution. It is not, howcxer, to be forgotten that t he 1 e&t and sure st guarante e of the primary rights of (itiztiishlti Is to Ik; found in that c a pat ity fur self-protection which tun belong only to a people ttho-f right to univeisal suffrage is supported by imc rsal education. The means at the command of the local and State au thorities aie, in many caw s, wholly inade. epiate tofumi-h Ire-c'initriutioii to tttl who r,.i u TiiU U NiwiallT true where, be fore emancipation, the education of the peo ple was neglected or prevented, in the inter est of slavery. Firmly convinced th it the subject of opuIar education deserves the earnest attention of the people of the coun try, with a view to wise and comprehensive action of the Government of the United States, I respectfully recommend mat con rta suitable legislation and with prop er safeguards, supplement the local educa tional funds in the several States where the grave duties and responsibilities of citizen ship have been devolved on uneducated peo ple, by devoting to the purpose grants of the public land, and, if necessary, by appro priations from the Treasury of the United States. Whatever Government can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to tc done. Wherever general education is found, peace, virtue, aud social order pre vail, and civil and religions liberty are se cure. t IX 1L sEU ICE GEFOCU. In my former message", 1 have asked the attention of Congress to the urgent necessity of a reformation of the civil-service system of the Government. My views concerning the dangers of patronage, or appointments for personal or partisan considerations, have Iwcn strengthened by my observation and trrTwnro in the Executive otlicc. and I be lieve these dangers threaten the stability of the Government. Abuses so serious in mcir nature cannot be permanently tolerated. They tend to K-come more alarming with the m In rem ient of administrative service, as the growth of the country' iu population increases the number of ollicers and placemen employ ed. The reasons are imperative for the adop tion of fixed rules for the regulation ef ap pointments, promotions, and removals, estab lishing a uniform method, having exclusixe ly in view, in every instance, the attainment of the best qualifications for the position in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the the equal rights of all citizens and the most economical and efficient administra tion of tho public business, ('omncihive examinations, in aid of im partial appointments and promotions, have licen conducted for some years past in sever al of the Executive Departments, anil by my direction this system has been adopted in the custom houscs"and postofllces in the larger cities of the country. In the city of New York over two thousand positions in the civil service have leen subject, in their ap pointments and tenure oi place, to the opera tion of published rules for this purpose, dur ing the past two years. The results of these i practical trials have been very satisfactory, 1 and have confirmed my opinion in favor of this system of selection. All are subjected to the same tests, and the re-sull is free from prejudice by personal favor or partisan in fluence. It secures for the position applied for, the best epialifications attainable among the competing applicants. It is an effectual proiccuon irom uic pressure oi nnpuriuuu which, under any other course pursued, large ly exacts the time and attention of appoint ing officers to their great detriment in the discharge of othc r official duties preve nting the abuse of the service fcr the mere further ance of private or party purposes, and leav ing the employee of the Government, freed from the obligations imposed by patronage, to depend solely upon merit for retention and advancement, and with this constant incen tive to exertion and improvement. These invaluable results have been attained in a hifheiegrec in the ofliccs where the rules for appointment by conrpetitive examination have been applied. A method which basso approved itself by exjierimental tests at points where such tests may 1m? fairly considered conclusive, should be extended to all subordinate twsitions un der the Government. I believe that a strong and crowing public sentiment demand im mediate measures for securing and enforcing the highest jKWoiblc efficiency in the civil service, and its protection Irom recognized abu-es, and that the experience referred to has demonstrated the lcnsiuihty oi sucii measures. The examinations in the custom houses and peMoffices have been held under many embarrassments and without provision for compensation for the extra labor performed by the officers who have conducted them.and whose commenuaine interest in me improve ment of the public service has induced this devotion of time and labor without pecuniary reward. A continuance of these labors gratuitously ought not to 1 expected, and without an appropriation by Congress for compensation, it is not practicable to extend the sy stem of examinations genet ally through out the civil service. It U also highly mi- tioitanl that all such examinations should be conducted upon a uniform system and under general super i isiou. Section 1j.j oi tncKcxis ed Statutes authorizes the President to pres cribe the regulations" for admission to'thc civil service of the United States, and for this pur pose to employ suitable ersous to conduct the requisite inquiries with reference to "the fitness of each candidate, in respect to age, health, character, know ledge and ability, for the brunch of se rvicc into which he seeks to enter;' but the law is practically inopera tive for waul of the requisite appropriation. ltlicrelorc recommend an appropriation of S&I.OOO ner annum to meet the expenses of a commission, to be appointed by the 1 'resi dent in accord nice with the terms cf this section, whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform, aud efficient system of com petitive examination, and to supervise the ap plication of the same throughout the entire civil service of the Government. I am cr- suauetl mat me facilities wlncli such a com mission will afford for testing the fitness of those who apply for olllccwill not only be as welcome a relief to mcmlters of Cougiess as it will Ic to the J 'resident aud head of Departments but that it will also greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrassment which now inevitably and constantly attend tin conflicting claims of patronage letxeen the lA"gislative and Executive Departments. The must cff dual check upon lhc'wTuici(us competition of influence and ollh ut favorit ism, in the bestowal of office, will lie the sub stitution of an oku competition of merit be tween the applicants, in which eury one can make his own record with the assurance that his sutce n will depend upon this alone. 1 also recommend such legislation as, while leaving eve ry officer as free as any other citizen to express his j H-ilitu-.il opinions and to use his means for their advancement, sh-ill also enable him to feel as safe as any private citizen in refusing all dem mdsupuu ids salary for jiohlicul puqioscs. A law which should thus guarantee true lilieity and justice to all who are emragedin the public service, and likewise contain stringent pro visions against the iiseof ofliei d authority to coerce the Mihtiml union of private citizens or of oflii Ul subordinates is greatly to ! de al wd. "hie sivms 

SXS1I.XI," 1he most serioiH eibMach, however, to an imprnuinc nt of the civil service, and cs-jiee-iully !( i reform in (he method or ap pointtiHiit and removal, Imten found to he the practice, under what is known as the spoils extern, by which the uppointing -tower has been o largely encroached upoj by : members of Congress The first step in the rpfnrm nf the Hiil service must be a com plete divorce between Congress and the Exc- cutive m me mauer oi appuirunieiu. -corrupting doctrine that "to the victorsJe long the spoils," is inseparable from Con gressional patronage as the established rule ana practice oi parties in power, n to be understood bv applicants for office, and by the people generally, that lEeprcsentativcs anu renaiors are euum-u iu iau.w patronagc of their respective districts and Slates. It is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting from this invasion of the Uxecutivc function. The true principles of government ou the subjeci of appointments to office, as stated in the National conven tions of the leading parties of the country, have again and again been approved by the American people, and have not been called in question in any quarter. These authen tic expressions of public opinion upon tkis alt-imiortant subject, are the statement of principles that belong to the constitutional structure of the Government. "Under the Constitution, the President and heads of tho Departments arc to make nominations for office. The Senate is to ad vise aud consent to appointments, and the House of Representatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless ollicers. The best inter est of the public service demands that these distinctions be respected ; that Senators and Representatives, w ho may lie judges and ac cusers, should not dictate appointments to office. To this end the co-operation of the Legislative Department of the Government is required, alike by the necessities of the case and by public opinion. 51 embers of Congress will not be relieved from the de mands made upon them with reference to appointments to office until, by- legislative enactment, the pernicious practice is con demned and forbidden. It is therefore rccommcuded that an act be passed defining the relations of memlicrs of Congress with rcpect to apiointment to office by the I'resident, and I also recom mend that the provisions of section 1,767, and of the sections following, of the He vised Statutes, comprising the tenure of -office act, of March 2, 1SG7, be repealed. Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our country is one of the highest and most imperative du ties of statesmanship, and that it can be per manently done only by the co-operation of the Legislative and Executive Deturtinents of the Government, I again commend the whole subject to your considerate attention. It is the recognized duty and puipose of the people of the United States to suppress polygamy where it now exists in our Terri tories, and to prevent its extension. Faith ful and zealous elforts have been made by the United States authorities in Utah to en force the laws against it. Experience lias shown that the legisl ition upon this subject. to De elleclive, i (.quires extensive mouinca tlon and amendment. The longer action is delayed, the more difficult it will be to ac complish what is desired. Prompt and de cided measures are necessary. The Mormon sectarian organization which upholds polyg amy has the whole power of makingand exe cuting the local legislation of the Territory. Ily its control of the grand and petit juries, it possesses large influence over the adminis tration of justice. Exercising, as the heads of this sect do, the local political power of the Territory, they aie able to make effective their hostility to the law- of Congress on the subject of polygamy, aud, in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Poly gamy w ill not be abolished if the enforce ment of the law devnds on those who prac tice and uphold the crime. It can only lie suppressed by taking away the political pow er of the sect which encourages and sustains it. The power of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect the Territories is ample. It is not a case for halfway measures. The po litical power of the Mormon sect is increas ing ; it controls now one of our wealthiest and nion populous Territories. It is ex tending steadily into oilier lermones. Wherever it goes it establishes polygamy and sectariau political power. The sanctity of marriage and the family relation are the corner-stone of our American siKricty and civili zation. Religious Iilcr!y and the separation of Church and State arc among the element ary ideas ef free institutions. To re-establish the interests and principles which polyg amy andMormonism have imperilled, and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous im migrants of all creeds that part of our do main which (has been, in a great degree, closed to general immigration by intolerant anil immoral institutions, it is rccomincudecl that the government of the Territory of Utah be reorganized. 1 recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a governor and judges or commissioners, appointed by the Presi dent and confirmed by the Senate a govern ment analogous to the provisional govern ment established for the Territory northwest or the Ohio, by the ordinance of "17&7. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form of local government, I recom mend that the right to vote, hold office, and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah, be con tlued to those who neither practice nor up hold iolygauiy. If thorough measures aie adapted, it is beliei.cd thatwilhinafew years the evils which now attlict Utah will be era dicated, aud that this Territory will iu good time become one of the most prosjicrous aud attractive of the new States of the Union. OU; toREION i:ei ATIONS. Oar relations with all foreign countries have been thoe of uudUturhcd peace, and have presented nooce-asiou for concern as to their continued maintenance. My anticipation of an early reply from the IIriLi.Ii Government to the demand of indem nity loour fishermen for the injuries suffered by that industry at fortune Ray, in January, 138, which I expresseil in my last annual message, was disappointed. This answer was received only iu the latter part of April in the present year, aud wheu received, ex hibited a fuilure of at cord between the two Governments a1 to the measure of the inshore-fishing privilege secured to our fisher men by the treaty of Washington, of so seri ous u character that I matle it the subject of a communication to Congress, in which I re commended the adoption of the measures which bccmcd to le proper to be taken by this Government in maintenance of the rights aceoieled to our fishermen under the ticaty, and towards mi curing an indemnity for the injury these mtcicsU hadsuffered. A bill to carry out these recommendations was under consideration by the House or Representa tives at the time or the adjoin nine nt of Con gress iu June hist. Within a lew weeks 1 haw ruieda e ommunicatioii from Her Majesty's Govern ment, renewing the consideration of the sub ject, both of the indemnity for the injuria at I'uituuc Ray, and of the interpretation of the treaty in which the previous correal u J -e nee hud shown the two Governments to le at vjiriawc. Uimjii both these topics the elis- poiitiou towards a lriendly agreement is m in: Tested by a recognition of our right to an indemnity lor the transaction ut lortune li'iy, leaving the measure of uch indemnity to further conference, and by an assent to the view of this Gocrnment, presented in the previous correspondence, that the regu lation of conflicting interests of the shore fishery of the 1 'round il sea coasi$. and the vessel fishery of our fishermen, should be made the suhject of conference ami concur rent arrangement between the two Govern ments. I sincerely hope that the basis may be fouml for a speedy adjustment of the very j-erious divergence of views in the interpretation of the fishery clauses of the treaty of Washing ton, which, as the correspondence oeiwcen tiie two Governments stood at the close of the last session of Congress, seemed to ue irre concilable. In the important exhibition of art and in dustries, which was helil last year at Sydney. New South Wales, as well as in that now iu progress at 3IeIbourne, the United States haie been efficiently and honorably repre sented. The exhibitors from this country at the former place received a large number of awards in some oi ttic most consieierauic de partments, and the participation of the United States was recognized by a special mark of distinction. In tin exhibhicu at Melbourne, the share taken by our country is no Ies3 notable, and an equal degree of suc cess is confidently expected. The state of peace and tranquility now cn joyeel by all the nations of the continent of Europe has its favorable influence upon our diplomatic ami commercial relations with them. Ue have concluded and ratified a convention with the Trench Republic for the settlement of claims of the citiens of cither country against the other. Under this con vention a commission, presided over by a distinguished publicist, appoint ed, iu pursuance of the request of both nations, by His Majesty the Emperor of llrazil, has been organized and has begun its sessions in this (ity. A congress to con sider means for the protection eif industrial property has recently been in session in Paris, to which I have appointed the Minis ters of the United States in Prance nntl in liclgium as ilelegites. The International Commission upon Weights ami Measures also continues its work in Paris. I inite your intention to the necessity of an appro priation to ue mado in time to enable tins Government to comply with its obligations under the Metrical Convention. Ourfnendly rehtions with the German Empire continue without interruption. At the recent International Exhibition of Pish and Pishcries at Berlin, the participation of the United States, notwithstanding the haste with which the commission was forced to make Us prcpirations, was extremely suc cessful anil meritorious, winning for private exhibitors numerous awards of a high class, and for the country at large the principal priic oi nonor eniered ty ins .Majesty the Emperor. The results of this great success cannot but be advantageous to this import ant and growing industry. There have U-e-n some questions raised betw ecu the two Gov ernments as to the proper e ffect and inter pretation oi our treaties oi naturalization, but recent despatches from our Minister at Hcrlin show th it favorable progress is mak ing towurel an understanding, in accordance with the views of this Government, which makes and admits no distinction whatever I iel ween the rights of a native and a natural ized citizen of the United States, In prac- by natural izcil citizens abroil hive never been fewer than at present. there is nothing t mipoilin. to note in our unbroken lriendly relations with the 1 governments oi Austna-ilun uy, Kus-i.i, Portugal, Sweden and Xonvay, Switzeiland, Turkey and Greece. During the last summer several vsels be longing to the merchant marine of this coun try, sailing in neutral waters of the Nest In ches, w ere fired at, bo ireled, and searched by an armed cruiser nf the Spanish government. The circumstances, ns reported, involve not only a private injury to the persons con-' cerneel, but also seemed too little observant of j the friendly n lations existing for a century between this country and Spiin. The wrong was brought to the attention of the Spanish government in a serious pretest and remons trance, ami the matter is undergoing investi-1 gition by the royal authoritic, with a view I to such explanation or icnaratioii as m iv be i called for by th.- fata" a ( The commission Mttir- '.i l!u t ity fer the adjudication of claim- ot our citiens against tne government oi ji.un, is, 1 hope1, ap proaching the termination of its Ubors. The claims against theUnitcdStates under the Plorida Treaty with Sp tin were submit ted to Congress for its action at the late ses sion, and I agaiu invite your attention to this long-standing (picstion, witua view to a limit disposition of the matter. At the invitation of the StiaiiMi govern ment, a conference his recently been he Mat the city of Madrid tojeonsider the subject of j protection by foreign Powers of nathc Moors in the Empireof Morocco. The .Minister of the.

The ' instrument will be 1 del before the Senate for i us eousHierauoii. i ne guYcruiueui oi me United States has also lust no opportunity to urge upon that of the Emperor of Morocco the nee-essity, iu accordance with the hu mane and enlightened spirit of the age, of puttiu ' an end to the persecutions, which have been so prevalent in that country, of persons of a faith other than the Molciu, and especially of the He-brew residents of .Morocco. The cemsular treaty concluded with liel- gium has not ye Ik-cu officially promul-t gated, owing to the alteration ot a word in j thetext by the Senate of the United States, which cxxMsioncd a delay, during which the time allowed for ratification expired. The Senate will be aked to extend the peri si for ratification. , The attempt to nciroliate a treaty of extra dition with Denmark failed on account of j the objection of the Danish government to the usual clause prouding th it each nation 1 should pay the expense of the arrest of the 1 lersons whose extradition it a-ks. , The proxision made by Congress, at its last session, for the exense of the commission j which had leen appointee! to cnle r upon ue-1 gotiations with the IutiHrial Gtixennent of 1 China, on subjects of greit interest to the I reiitiousoi the two countries euibled the i commissioners to proceetl at once upon their mission.

In my last annual m ssairo l invited the attention of Congress to the subject of the indemnity funds receivi d some years ago irom c uina and Japan, i renew tne recom mendation then made, that whatever por tions of thee funds arc due to American citizens should be promptly paid.and the res idue returned to the nations, respectively, to wlncli ttiey justly and equuaoiy ociong. The extradition treaty with the kingdom of the Netherlands, which has been for some lime in course of negotiation, has, during the pist year, been concluded ami duly ratilied- lielations of friendship and amity have ueen estaoiisneit between me iovcrnmnt or the United States and that of Roumania. We have sent a diplomitie representative to llucharest, and have received at this capital tho special envoy, who has betn charged by I lis Royal Highness, Prince Charles, to an nounce the independent sovereignty of Rou mania. We hope for a spec dy development of commercial relations between the two countries. In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence of quiet on the border between this country and Mexico would sooa Income so assured as to justify the modificatim of the orders, then in force?. to our military commanders, in regard to crossing the frontier, without encouraging sucii eiisuiriiinees as would endanger ttic peace of the two countries. Events moved In accordance with these expectations, and t tie orders were accordingly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of "our own citizens and the Mexican Government. Subseeiucntlv the peace of the border was again disturlwd by a savage foray, unde r the command of the Chief Victorio, lint, by the combined and harmonious action of the military forces of !oth countries, his band has been broken up and substantially destroyed. There is reason to believe th it the obstacles which have so long prevented rapid ami con venient communication Utwcen the United States ami Mexico by railways, arc on the point of d.sappcaring, and that several im portant enterprises of thij chancier will soon be set on foot which cannot fail to contribute largely to the prosperity of both countries. Mew envoys !rom Guateniali, Colombia, Bolivia. Venezueli, and Nicaragua have re cently arriveil at this capital, whose distinc lion aud enlightenment afford the best guar antee of the continuance of friendly rela tions lie t ween ourselves and these sister lepublics. The relations between this Government and that of the United States of Colombia have engaged public attention during the past year, mainly by reason of the project of an intc-oceauic canal across the isthmus oi Panama, to be built by private capital under a concession from the Colombian Govern ment for that purpose. The treaty obliga tions subsisting between the United States and Colombia, by which wc guarantee the neutrality of the transit and the sovereignty and property of Colombia in the Isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions under which so stupendous a change in the region embraced in this guarantee should be effect edtransforming, as it would, this Isthmus, from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pa cific ex-cans, intoagatev.ny ai.d thoroughfare between them, for the navies ami the mer chant ships of the world should receive the approval of this Government, as being compatible with the discharr" of these obli gations on our pait, aud consistent with our ittteifM-s itn the principal commercial owcr of the Western Hemisphere. The views which expressed in a spee'al message to Congress in March last, in rel ition to this project, I deem it my duty again to press upon your attention. Subsequeait consideration has but con firmed the opinion ''that it is the right and duty of the United States to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any inter-oceanic canal across the Isthmus tint connects North and South America as will protect our National Inter est." The war liclwien the Republic of Chili on the- one hand, ami the allied Republics of Peru and ISofivia on the other, still con tinues. This Government has not felt call ed upon to interfere in a contest that is xwth in the belligerent rights of the parties as in dependent State-". We have-, however, always held ourselves in readiness to aid in accommodating their difference', and have at different times reminded both belliger ents of our willingness to render such ser vice. Our good olticc.s, iu this direction, were recently accepted by all the U Uigcrent, and it was hoped they would prove efficacious; but I regret to announce that the measures, which the ministers of the United States at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take, with the view to bring about a peace, were not successful. In the course e.f the xvar some questions have arisen allecting neutral rights; mall of these the ministers of the United States have, under their instructions, ae ted with promptness and cm igy iu protec tion of American interests. The relations of tjie Uuitcil Slateswilh the Empireof Hraz'd continue to lie nio-r cordial, and their commercial iutcn u; - ' lehly in creases to their inuluil advantage. The internal disorders with whieh the Ar gentine Republic has for some time past been al!Iicteel, and which have more or less influ enced Its external trade, are understood to have Urn brought to atlose. This hippy result may be exacted to nelound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of that Re public as well as to the development ef its vat interior resources. In Samoa, the government of King Mal ic toa, under the support and recognition of the consular representatives ef the United States, Gieat Britain, uud Germiny, seems to h ue given peai e and tranquillity to tho Minds.

The interest in these ef forts, as developetl in our commercial com munities, and the value of the information secured by this meai.s, to the trade and manufactures or th country were recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was made for the more frequent publication of consular and other reports by the Department of State. The first issue of this publication uas now wen prepared, and sunsetpieut issues may regularly lie expected. The im portance and interest attached to the reports of consular ollicers. are xxitneseel by the general demand for them by all classes of merchants and manufacturers cngageel in our foreign trade. It is believed that the system ot such publications is deserving of the approxal ot Congress, and that the necessary appropriations for its continu ance and enlargement x ill commend it-elf to your consieleratioti. i he prosperous energies of ni;r elomestic industries, and their immense production of the subjects of foreign commerce, invite, and even require, an active develepment of the xxishes and interests uf our people in that direction. ispceially important is it that our commeicial relations with the At lantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies ami the Gulf of Mexi co should lie direct, and not through the cir cnit of European systems, and should lie ear ned on in our own bottoms, ihe lull appreciation of our opportunities which our front on the Pacific cxt-an gives to commerce with Japan, China, and the East Indies, with Australia and the Island groups xvhich lie along these routes of navigation, should inspire equal efforts to appropriate to our own fchiipping, aud to administer by our own capital, a due proportion of this trade. Whatever modifications of our regulations of trade and nax-iiration may be necessary or useful to meet aud direct these impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges and of our carrying trade, I am sure the xxisdom of . Congress will lie ready to supply. One ini tial uieasure, hoxxever," seems to me so clear ly useful ami efficient that I venture to press it Uou your earnest attention. It seems to bo very evident that the provision of regu lar steam-postal communication, by aid from Gox'erumet, has been the forerunner of the commercial predominance or Great IJrit ain on all these coasts ami seas, a greater share in whose trade is now the desire ami the intent of our people. It is also manifest that the efforts of other European Nations to contend with Great Rrituiu tor a shire of this commerce have been successful in pro portion with their adoption of regular steam wstal communication with the mirkets xx hose trade they sought. Mexico ami the Stale of South Anieni a are aaxious to re ceive such postal communications with this country, and to aid in their develepement. Mimlar co-operation may lie looked lor, m due time, irom the Eastern Nations and from Australia. It is difficult to See how the lead in this movement can lo expected from private interests. Iu respect of toreign commerce, quite as much n iu internal trade, postal communication seems neces sarily a matter of common and public ad ministration, aud thus pertaining to Gov ernment. I resiecti fully recommend to your prompt attention such just and emcient measures as may conduce to the develop ment of our foreign commercial exchanges and the building up of our carrying trade. In tins connection I desire also to suggest the very great scrxicc xhieh might be ex pected in enlarging and facilitating our com merce on the Pacific ocean, were a trans marine cable laitl from Sm Pranciso to the Sandwich Islands, and thence to Japan at the North ami Australia at the South. The great influence of such means of communi cation on these routes of navigition, in de veloping and securing the ilue share of our Pacific coast in the commerce of the- worhl, need no illustration or enforcement. It may be that an enterprise1, useful and in the end profitable as it xvould prove to private investment, may need to n accelerated by prudent legislation by Comrrc-s in its aid, anil I submit the matter to your careful con- sieleration. An ndililiona), and not unimportant, al though secoiidarx, reason for f ottering and enlarging the Naxy miy be found m the unquestionable service to the expulsion ef our commerce, xxhich would be remit red by Ihc frequent cire ul ition of naval ships in the seas and -rts of all qu irters of the ln!k Ships of the proper construction and equip ment, to lie of the trreatest ellictenev iu case of maritime xvar, might be matle constant and active agents in lime of pcatv m the ad vancement and protection eif our foreign truth.', and in the nurture and discipline of young seamen, xxho would, naturally, in some numbers, mix xxitb ami improxc the crews eif our me rt hant-ships. ir me r ehants at home and abroad recognize the value to foreign commerce of an active movement of our naval vessels, aud the intelliirencc and palmitic eat of our naval ollicers in promoting ex cry interest eif their couutryincn, is a just -libject of n-diond prltle. TitL t IN We The com lit ion of the financial affairs of the Government, as shown by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, is very satis factory.

.VJ,C9I, l'JO Si. The receipts thus tar, of the current year, togeth er with the estimated re ceipts for the remain eler of the year amount to 3.'iO,0(0,000, xxhich xvill be suilicient to meet the estimated expenditures of the year, and leave a surplus of jjyo.ooo.ooo. It is fortunate tlut thislanre surplus rexe- nue occurs at a perioel xxhen it may he direct ly applied to the payment of the public debt soon to be redeemable'. Xo public duty has been more constantly cherished in the United States than the policy of paying the Nation's debt a3 rapidly as possible. The debt ot the United States, less cash in the Treasury and exclusive of accruing inter est, attained its maximum of t2,75ti,4aif5I7. 4:t in August, lbCi, and ha3 since that time been reduceel to fel,&tj,01V,o04 bVi. Of the principal of the ekbt, 610,7o8,10(J has been paid since March 1, lb", effecting an annual saving of interest of iC,lU7,5y3. The burden of interest has also been diminished by the sale or. uoneis hearing a low rale ot interest, and the application of the procecels to the re demption of bends bearing a higher rate. The annual saving thus secured since March 1, 1377, is $U,2lM),45&5tf. Within a short perienl over si hundred millions of five and si per cent bonds will become redeemable. This presents a very favorable opportunity not only to further re duce the principal ot the debt, but also to re duce the rate ot interest on that which will remain unpaid. I call the attention of Cca gress to the views expresseil on this subject liy the Secretary of the Treasury in his an nual report, and recommend prompt legisla tion, to enable the Treasury Department to complete the refunding of the debt xxhich is about to mature. The continuance: of specie piyments has not been interrupted or endangered since the dite of resumption. It Las contributeel greatly to the revival of business aud to out remarkable prosperity. The fears that pre cctled and accompanied resumption have proved groundless. Xo considerable amount of United States notes have been presented for redemption, while cry large turns of goKI bullion, both domestic and iuiKrted, aie taken to the mints and exxlunged for coin or notes. The increase of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1, ls7!r is esti mated at t 7,b,'J'., 12. There are still in existence, uncau.-lleel, ilMU.lWt.Ulflot United States le-gal-tende-i notes. These note-3 x ere authorlzeil as a war measure, nude necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in xxhich the UuitedStates xvas then engaged. The preservation of the 2sa tiou existence retmireel, in the judgment of Congress, an issue of legal-lender paper money. That it served ell the purpose foi which it xx as created is not questioned, but the employment of the notes as paper money indefinitely, after the accomplishment of the objei t fer xxhich they xxere provided, was not contemplated by the framers of the law un tie r xxhich the xxere issued. These notes long Mace liecame like any other pecuniary obligation of the Government a debt to be paid, aud, xxhen paid, to lie cancelled as mere exiJence of an indebtedness no longer existing. I therefore repeat xxhat xvas said iu the annual message of last year, that the retirement from cireul ition of United States notes, with the capacity or legal teuder in private evntracts, is a step to be taken iu our progress towards a afe a nil stable cur rency, xx hich slmuitl be acet pteel as the policy and duty of the tlovernment and the interest and security of the pea pie.
