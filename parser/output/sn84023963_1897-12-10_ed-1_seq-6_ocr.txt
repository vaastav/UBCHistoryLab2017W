At once Miss M -Kinley saw that something had hap pened. She awakened the other mem bers of the family and a physician was cal.ed. He at once pronounced the trouble paralysis. "Mother" McKinley had been slight ly ill for several days with a mihi at tack of the grip. She had been up aud abo-it the house, and no serious results from her illness were apprelieuded. Her aon Abner McKinley, of New York, arrived in C anton on Tuesday, and his mother seemed to be greatly cheered by his presence. Yesterday abe was ao bright and cheerful as to cause the family to remark on her im provement. Mr. McKinley aajing he had not aeen his mother looking ao well for a number of years. That beiug her conditiou when she retired last evening, the blow to the family upon discovering what had come upon her duriutf lh- night was a sad one. Dur ing the forenoon a letter from the president was received. It waa read to the aged sufferer and in response to questions if abe understood its con tents she nodded assent Mr. Abner McKinley communicated with the president as soon as he learned the serious nature of the ill ness of his mother, and the president asked that he le advised immediately of auy change. Appointments were made for communication by telephone, and telegram-, were also exchan,;, 1 fi quently. S.ion after Mr. Abner McKinley not. tied the president that the sufferer had relapsed into semi consciousness, and promised to com niun ii-aie further at ti o'clock. The president did not wait for the five oVl'N-k message. He responded: Tell mother I will be there," and at once prepared tostart for Canton. He is expected to arrive here at ten o'clock to-morrow morning. Dr. Phillip, wheu he saw the pa tient at aix o'clock this evening, had little to add to what he had already aaui. to the effect that she waa very III and stood but little chance of re covery. It was the opinion of the doc tor that she could not last more ttian a few days and tue cud might come at auy time. Inquiriea concerning the condition of Mi V i-Kinley are coming t Can ton from all over the country, floods of telegrams coming as s on as the newa as made pui.l.'-

Acting Post master (ieueral Perry S. Heath, has is sued the following circular regarding th rural postal free delivery. "The ultimate success of the experi ment of free delivery of mail, which ia now being tried, by direction of congress, iu 50 rural districts of the United States, will depend largely upou the promptness with which the carriers caa make their deliveries to the patrons on their routes. Thia will be greatly facilitated if those desiring to take advantage of rural free delivery will erect suitable boxes by the roadside, in which car riers may deposit mails as they pass, and from which they may collect the mails intended for transmission. The time which would otherwise be con sumed by carriers io reaching resi dences some distance back from the road will thus be aaved, the service will be rendered more efficient, ita coat will lie reduced and the probability of its becoming a permanent feature of the postal administration will be increased.
