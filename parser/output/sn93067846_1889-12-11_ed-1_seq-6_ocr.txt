fte Auijs-tii ar? Jit?rca. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER ll. Tne President's Messag? The annual message of President Harrison, which was seat to the two houses of the U. S. Congress last week is summarized by the National Demo? crat of Washington, D. C;, as follows : When the Republicans nominated Benjam?n Harrison for President iu 1888 they selected bim largely for the reason that iu the whole record of what he had said and done in public life there was almost nothing which was offensive to any member of the party-coothing that was likely to drive away Republi? can votes. The message which he sent to Congress on Tuesday is character? istic of the man who had such a safe record in 1888. It is the message of a timid, cautious, cunning politician, who follows his party r.od does not load it, and who hopes to stay in the White House for eight years by pursuing the same non assertive, non-committal coarse which bas served him so well in the past. Mr. Harrison's message is a message of skips and dodges, of party echoes and half-way recommendations. He says he has not had time to examine Mr. Win? dora'4 silver bullion certificate scheme, although during the past three weeks he has been able to devote three days to duck shooting in Mary laud. His strongest argument is iu favor of steam? ship subsidies, but even here he might have been far more d finite than he is He advocates federal appropriations for common schools in the States, but in a form which the advocates of the Blair bill must find wholly unsatisfactory. He evideotly does not dare to indulge in bole! advocacy of the scheme for taking the control of Congressional j elections out of the hands of the State authorities and merely talks about ex? tending the present system of 'Super? vision " To the solution of the tariff problem he contributed absolutely ootb- j ing of value He will sign any meas-j ure that his party friends in Congress j may send to bim and to them he leaves ! the whole busiuess for settlement So, j foo, in the matter of pension legislation his remarks are quite general. He wants more done for the needy veterans, but he makes no suggestions as to de? tails. His* remarks concerning the civil service law are noteworthy chiefly for his effort to relieve himself of res? ponsibility for the utter ignoring of all civil ser trice principles which character? ized the grand rout of the railway mail ] i service \>y the Republican politicians io j i March and April last. Everything of real importance which he has to say could have been compress- i ed into & quarter of a column of this c paper, but he occupies nearly two of t our pages in saying it. We publish jj the document as a part of the political j 1 annals of the time, but we shall not J ? often give up so much space to such un- j i inter es ti cg matter. 1 What Mr. Harrison might bare ven tured to say if bis party had not been ? i defeated in many of its strongholds | 1 only a month ago it is useless to speen- i late about. What is clear is that con- j < cerniog the groot interests of the people j i he has very little of value to say, and he says it voluminously. The N. Y. Times says: "No other motive than fear could have restrained the President from making clear and j < specific recommendations of tariff re- j i visio?. He knows that men who voted j ( for him and sp^nt their money for his j t electron"are now demanding relief from 1 ? the exactions of the tariff laws, and he j t knows that the industries of the coun- j 1 * try fleed :he relief.'* . i f The Wilmington. N. C. Messenger j t says: Mr. Harrison has placed himself j i in a position that he hopes no doubt i s will enable him to change with the 1 course of his party io the Congress ti their anion should lead to the re- ! ( duct ion of the war tariff of 47 10 per j i cent, he will say that he foreshadowed > 1 that in his message when he ?poke of J < revising "the schedules " Ile will ! s make revision and reduction synooy- ! 1 moos in his present vocabulary. But i 1 if the radical protectionists bold their j 1 grip and succeed in retaining the old ! ; war tax he wtii be ready :o poiut to his j 1 message and say, I did not favor re form beyond smoothing inequalities, j and did not ?>ay a word of reducing the j i 47 10 average, nor did I lower the 1 claims of the protectionists, but really proposed extending the priucitile. Did . I not say : "The inequalities of the j , law should be adjusted but the protec- j tive principle should be maintained and J fairly appiied to the products of OUT j ; farms as well as of our shops n * * * ; He talks of the tariff iu one place and ? two columns removed he lug? in a brief paragraph concerning the dangerous j and ruinous and vile trusts. But for the tariff these trusts would uot and j could not exi*t and prosper. j -'mm - m i - A Potttftowu. Pa , dispatch says that j last Fuday morning John Chana, a! hopeless paralytic, age! S5, wag found ! dead on the fl cr of his hotel wi:|? a i leather strap loosely fastened around j his neck. Some maintain that it was fuicide. while others thar it was f,;iii | play, though suicide is the generally] accepted theory. (Tnn! recently Chana j was a fine specimen of physical mau-' hood. It is related that (?ne day he ? cursed his Creator in a most horrible manner, when he fell over, stricken j dumb and paralyzed ir??ni h-ad ti? foot \ He remaiucd in this condition until hi? \ death. Mr. F M Rogers. Jr., nf Florence, j writes the Department of Agriculture ! that he has sold 18.000 pounds of h.* j this year's crop, and ail at good prices ; I that all cn that vicinity who raised to- j bacoo have been able to sell it at good ; pricer, and last, but not {east, that in the vii?njw of Florence a"o/.e 1,2001 acres of tobacco will he planted the com i ing year. As the tobacco acreage of. the eutire isate f?r this year was but 635 acres, the importance of the fact j that it is to be doubled ne xt y ear iu one County alone will easily be seen. - imm. -. m - There was great excitement in ,' Washington City last, week over the ; discovery of the ?ighl of the cashier of the Sergeant a* Arms of the House of Representative*, with a large auroa nt nf toon ey which he had drawn from the Treasury, about ?7*J 00"@ ; it i> supposed be is iu Canada, and tnat pos : ebly the character of the steal is puch that be cannot be extradited.

The News has made reference to the blubbering boy who afflicts all boy's schools ; we suppose the case is the same to girl's schools. Wherever there is a type of man there is a type of woman to match him-though, fortu? nately for the world, the representa? tives of the types rarely marry each other-and no doubt there is a kind of girl to match e^ery kind of a boy, good, bad and indifferent, endurable, unen? durable and average. Whether the blubbering boy and the sniffling girl grow up to be sensitive men and women, we really do not know; but it is a fact that there are such men and women and that on occa? sions, and oftentimes without occasions, they succeed in being most particularly unpleasant. Their feelings are ever? lastingly getting in somebody's way They are perambulating man traps per? petually set and ready to catch some unhappy and innocent individual in es? pecially tight and uncomfortable places Their tears start at the slightest acci? dental touch and quench wich freezing moisture the most brilliant pleasures: their dismal looks slide simultaneously along the moral spines of each member of the happiest assemblages and chill the genial currrent of their fun like so much ice ; they hang out signals of dis? tress and displays of woe when seas and skies are sunniest and in an instant throw over everything an impalpable cloud, not seen but felt, and changing the atmosphere from warmth and bright? ness to discomf ?rt and twilight. All of us have known and suffered from them and have debated whether to be the more sympathetic for themselves or our? selves. It is about a toss up whether the un? duly sensitive or the unnaturally cal? lous is the more unfortunate. We can pity the first, but for the other there can be only contempt. No human be? ing is born into this world with the toughness of moral 6bre we sometimes encounter It is acquired depravity, attained only by stifling all the feelings that entitle manhood and womanhood to respect. But even the pushing, br:.zen, unabashed subject whom no rebuke or rebuff can reach is less likely to cause trouble to others than the unduly sen? sitive. On an adamantine cheek we j ian at least exercise the luxury of an- J ger and spend our wrath with our ?frength in vain efforts to bruise if. But with the over-sensitive there is no j relief. The more our anger rises the j more brutal we become in <>ur own ? ?yes We may be-swollen to the burst? ing point with resentment that offence las been taken where aeoe was meant, j hat the word sent out to evoke a smile >r fill a conversational gap has brought | jpon us a flood of unwelcome salt water I >r a cool gust of sighs, but there is no i .emedy. Indeed we, who are the iu ured. are forced into the position of brutal aggressor and compelled, much igainst our wills and grains, to trickle orth amiability and consolation wheo ire long to thunder maledictions. It is a hard thing to say, bat we fear j t ts the truth that excessive sensitive- I less, like excessive awkwardness and j >at>hfu'ine88, is the product of excessive j ?gotism. The sore points always held j n the way of all passers by are usually j jroduced by too much rubbing of the j uind against its owner's personality. I The people who find a slight or an in- j ?ult or a wound in every word and act >f their fellows are really affected by ?n ex tggerated sense of the importance )f thetnselves and their affairs. They each themselves to crave more cou- ] ^deration than they are fairly eutitled j :o aod to exaggerate the place they j lold in the thoughts of others. Con? sequently they s?ize and stick into j heti.selves ali the arrows they car. S:id n the air, meant to be harmless er limed at somtbDQy else, or manufacture j "rom the most iooocent of pellets There is a natur tl and proper degree ! )f sensitiveness which recognizes aud o ? .esents an insult, rebuff or iusolence. [t ts an instinct and is best governed by ;Ommon sense The only cure for over <ensitiveness is the cultivation of modesty and generosity-thinking less >f ourselves and more of other people, I reducing our estimates of our own merits ; ind deserts and increasing our disDost j tiou to think charitably of th^ purposes j and dispositions of others. The people j who are really unselfish, whose purpose j io life is to promote the pleasure and ? welfare of others, and who are ready to j give to others all they are entitled to | and always a little over to be sure of good mesure, nre the happiest af*er all | that ts done and sa>d. They are never '. found among the over-sensitive; they j are rarely afflicted ty the slings and a - j rows of their friends because they do not i hold up their vanities to be shot at i TiK-y do not invite a?au!t and, cooee ? quentiy, hardly ever receive it ; they do ! not assume that all their acquaintances { are malicious or envious and, th refore, do not twist everything they see or hear ! into cause of offence. j Ci.a.i'y not only ,M>%*er* a multitud?

TRAINING. Something About tho Teaching of Little Children to Si HR. Two questions in connection with the training of the voice are to be discussed, viz.: VVhen it should be commenced and whether it should be interrupted during the so called "cracking" period. With regard to tho first of these questions I am strongly of opinion that training can hardly bo begun too early. Of course, the kind and amount of practice that are necessary in the adult would be mon? strous in a young child, but there is no reason why, even at the age of 6 or 7, the right method of voice production should not be taught. Singing, like any other art, is chiefly learned by imitation, and it seems a pity to lose the advantage of those precious early years when that faculty is most highly developed. There is no fear of injuring the larynx or straining the voice by elementary instruction of this kind. On the contrary, it is habitual faulty vocalization which is pernicious. The sooner the right way of Using the *oice is taught the more easy will it be to guard against the contraction of bad habits, which can only be corrected at a later period with infinite trouble. Many of the finest voices have beejj trained almost from the cradle, so to speak. I need only to mention Adelina Patti, Christine Nilsson, Jenny Lind and Mme. Albani. but there are numbers of other queens of song who owe a great part of their success to the same cause. As for the other point, 1 am still an ob? stinate dissenter from the "orthodox" teaching of singing masters on the sub? ject. I have already more than once ex? pressed my l>elief that there is no reason why training, within certain limits and under strict supervision by a competent person, should not be carried on when the voice is in the transition stage of its development from childhood to adoles? cence. The steck argument, invariably ad? vanced to prove the necessity of suspend? ing the education of the voice till it has passed through the "breaking" period, is that, as the parts are undergoing active changes, they therefore require complete rest. This would equally apply to the limbs, and, in some degree, also to the brain. Yet I am not aware that it has ever been proposed to forbid growing lads from exercising their bodies, even in games involving considerable muscu? lar violence, orto interrupt the education of the mental powers till the brain has become fully formed. Over pressure there may be, no doubt, in voice training as in other kinds of instruction. All voices are not capable of bearing the same amount of training. . Each case must be dealt with according to what the doctors call the particular "indications" that may arise. My thesis holds good only as a rule, to which t?tere may he many individual exceptions. A judicious teacher will, however, have no difficulty in deciding as to the best course to adopt in any given instance.-Sir Morell Mac? kenzie in Contemporary Review. IS LirK WOKT1I LIVING ?
