It has put im perialismt on the defensive, not alone German imperialism. but Italia. French and British. He has put his stamp of dilspprcval on the boasts about seising the west bank of the Rhine. the dismemberment of Aus tria and the occupation of Trieste.

The British "brltter enders" interpret the address as "no reace with the Hohenzollerns." The British Paciflsts consider him as a sympathetic friend.

Special Cable to Washington Xerald and the New York Tribune. London. Dec. 6.-London was awak ened early this morning by the rumble of distant gunfire, and the people wers routed from their warm beds and driven halt clad to the icy basements when 2; Gothas joined in one of the most determined, and at the same time, one of the most unsuccessful at tacks ever made on the capital. In the metropolitan area 3 persons were killed and 10 injured; In outlying districtas bombs killed 7 more persons and injured 21. according to announce ment in the House of Commons by the Chaneellor of the Exchequer. The ac tual damage inflicted on the city and its environs was small and the Ger mans paid for their doubtful success with the destruction of at least two aeroplanes and the damaging of sev eral others. Attack Is Umhersalided. The raid, the first in a menth, came as a surprise, the big machines ap pearing several hours later than ever before. At 5 O'clock. in clear. cold weather, with the moun half way down toward the horison, five groups of Gothas crossed the Essex and Kent coasts and drove inland, attack tag the heart of London from the northeast. the east and the south west. amid a perfect hurricane of jiunlre. All previous berrages were p..t to shame by the leaden wall which the British anti-aircraft guns raised. around the city, the minute the raiders approached. For an hour CON1NUED OS PAG TWO. UsJS TO WAR ON RepiA6vAppeaks for Hostilities on Bulgaria and Turkey. Predi, tion that President Wilson will soon ask for a declaration of war on Bulgaria and Turkey. as well as on Austria. and intimation that Plans already are under way for American aid in the allied Balkan campaign, featured yesterday's Con gressional program. Representative Clarence Miller, of Minnesota. made both prediction and intimation. Mr. Miller took the floor to discuss the war resolution submitted by Chairman Flood for the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Shortly after ward the Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed on a war resolution ieclaring war against Austria. It liffered somewhat from the House resolution. "Neither Bulgaria nor Turkey has mny claim for our consideration." dr. Miller said. "This war must be leath to the German power. That neans death to the Bulgarian and rurkish part of it. Bulgaria. we cnow. entered this war for selfsh mrposes. She has no friend among he allies; she deserves none. "Bulgaria is today vigorously in he war. Permit not yourselves to e deceived by the subtle thought hat springs from what source I now not, but can suspect. that if re withhold our war declaration rom Bulgaria and Turkey we may I erhaps wean Bulgaria and Turkey i rom the central powers." Chairman Flood had not planned to j iscuss the resolution today, but I evertheless made a strong reply to Ir. Miller. Bulgaria has not even roken diplomatic relations, Mr. Flood tid, and has maintained very friend r relations. There are no Turkish mauls or diplomats in the country. a added. c The committee report submitted by a Ir. Flood reviewed- the strike plot ac vities of Ambassador Dumba, and a ie Austrian attitude on submarine s arfare. and other factors that led t o the breaking off of diplomatic re- a tlons. Mr. Flood will call up the tJ ar resolution today as the frst or er of business.
