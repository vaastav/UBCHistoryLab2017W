The affair of the discharge of that negro batallion at Fort Reno gives promise of being on Interesting one early In the present session of congress. There are several contributory causes to make It so. There are those who be lieve that the negroes were not given a square deal. There are others who will be inclined to criticise the unusual action of the president on general grounds and to these two groups mav be added a democratic contingent watchful 'of every opening for a poli tical attack.' The friends of the president will naturally endeavor to effect a divorce between the main question at Issue and the race problem. This was outlined early In the con troversy by a friendly newspaper at the time when it became evident that that matter would be made the sub ject of congressional inquiry. It said- "Probably the president's order would not have excited wide comment if the fact had not been made known that the soldiers were colored. Its propriety would have been assumed as a matter of course and as a proper measure of army discipline. The col or question. In fact, has nothing to do with the case. We presume no col ored man or friend of colored men. will claim that colored soldiers should be exempt from the rules that apply t.i white soldiers. "President Roosevelt is absolutely above suspicion of race prejudice or of acting from any other motive than the good of the service. To bring in the color of the dismissed battalion is to Inject a false and and Irrelevant issue and becloud the merits of the case." There is In the way of a general ac ceptance of this view, the fact that such a wholesale dismissal of troops is unprecedented; that the troops dis missed were negroes; that similar dis turbances In garrison towns or nearby towns have been frequent. In which disturbances white soldiers were the offenders. The question will likely be asked in congress as well as out of it, whether If the Twenty-fifth battalion had been composed of white soldiers instead of negroes it would now lie hewn from the United States army. It will also probably be asked wheth er in the 166 men so discharged, ther were not some wholly blameless of wrong and whose long service in the army had not earned for them some thing better than disgraceful dismissa'. NEW 

RULER OF ZION CITT. Vollva, the new boss of Zion City, seems to be the equal of Dowie in egotism and self assertlveness. He claims to hold his position by virtue of divine selection, and makes this statement: "I am not overseer by elec tion, nor will I admit that there is an other in Zion who could fill my place. Every hand raised against me will go down in destruction, and no petty co terie of jealous plotters can oust me." This is the man who a few months ago denounced the pretensions of "Elijah" Dowie as impudent and blasphemous. It should be rembered though, that the population of Zion City is composed of weak minded people who are suscepti ble to no other style of appeal. Dowie imposed upon them by his colossal au dacity, and Voliva must employ the same method or lose his grip. The fact that such a community is possible ex plains the power of such leaders. Where a Dowie could rule, a Voliva finds his opportunity. It Is simply a grotesque display of one phase or grade of hu man nature. We have received from a woman suf frage bureau: "Looking at the walls of her cell in the London Jail, Mrs. Mon teflore read such Inscriptions as these mementos of former occupants: 'Keep away from drink, or you'll come back here again;' "Fannie Lee, six months for stabbing;' and she left a record of her visit In the enamel of the ! bricks: "Dora Montefiore, two months for asking for votes for women.' Per haps the authqrities who caused Mrs. Montefiore to be locked up Implicated her in that rather violent suffragette attack upon numbers of parliament last The Arizona Star is engaging in a ' jollification over the pui chase by the smelter trust of a mine ntar Tucson, and finds in th's transaction much en- : touragement of the mining- Industry there, and business generally. This is proper and healthy joy. but from what the Star said throughout the last cam paign, we Inferred that in Its opinion there were already too many trusts and corporations in Arizona.' When we have fully established the Japanese in thelrtreaty rights, to send their children to schools Intended for white children, it might not be Improp er to take up the American-citizen light of the negro who cannot send his children to a white school in many American cities. Or, may a treaty with a foreign power confer upon the citi zens of that power rights In the United States superior to those Its citizens en Joy? That Is, may a treaty right be more valuable and sacred than a birth right? We suppose the litigation Insti tuted at San Francisco yesterday will determine all this. If the Jaapnese had been whipped in the war with Russia, little Inteiest could have been aroused in their com plaint against the San Francisco school authorities in' the unlikely event that they would have lodged complaint. Our extreme deference to them now resem bles the acquiescence of one who is looking Into the muzzle of a revolver in the hands of a highwayman. Whether it regards it us a news item worth while or not, we trust the Even ing Outcast will at least acknowledge the receipt of a copy of the president's message. Or better still. It might be returned to the White House marked "unavailable for our columns." An Indignant citizen of Ptescott pro tests to the Journal-Miner against the vicious practice of the boys of that town of snowballing passers-by. This protest should be given wide publicity throughout the east, where an alto gether contrary Impression of Arizona prevails. The small boy beginning to recover from the Thanksgiving surfeit is ul ready calculating what he would like in the Christmas bill of fare. If those Texans wno tried to lynch a negro for wearing a K. of P. badge were Pythians, they failed to recognize a Damon In the negro. The bridges which furnish Phoenix an outlet to the south are going out of commission a little earlier than usual this year. When the Caricature attacks the Car toon we are forced to recognize a state of internecine war.
