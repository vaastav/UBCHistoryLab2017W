WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—Following is the message of President Cleveland to congress: To the congress of the United States: The assemblage within the nation's leg islative halls of those charged with the duty of making laws for the benefit of a generous and free people impressively sug gests the exacting obligation and inexor able responsibility involved in their task. At the threshold of such labor now to be undertaken by the congress of the United States and in the discharge of an execu tive duty enjoined by the constitution, I submit this communication, containing a brief statement of the condition of our na tional affairs and recommending such leg islation as seems to me necessary and ex pedient. OUR 

VOBBION RELATIONS. .Advantages of a Firm Bnt Just Fonign Policy Set Forth. The history of our recent dealings with other nations, and our peaceful relations with them at this time additionally dem onstrate the advantage of consistently ad hering to a Arm but just foreign policy, free from envious or ambitions national schemes, and Characterized by entire hon esty and sincerity. Apart from the war in which the empire is engaged Japan attracts increas ing attention in this oountry by her evi dent desire to cultivate more liberal inter course with us and to seek our kindly aid in furtherance of her laudable desire for complete autonomy in her domestic Affairs and fall equality iril the family of nations. The Japanese empire of today is no longer the Japan of the past and our relations with this progressive nation should not be less broad, and liberal than with other Powers. v-?. A.y.

Asa further demonstration of respect and friendship our minister at St. Peters burg was directed to represent our gov ernment at the funeral ceremonies. The sealing interests of Russia in Behr ing sea are second, only to our own. A modus vivehdi has therefore been con cluded with the imperial government re strictive of poaching on the Russian rook eries and of sealing in waters which were not comprehended in the protected area defined in the Paris award. The Samoan islands, over which Ger many, England and America have a tri partite protectorate, have been the scene of considerable disturbances. The tri partite agreement is not altogether satis factory, and congress is asked to express its judgment as to the propriety of steps being taken by this government, looking to the withdrawal from its engagements with the other powers on some reasonable terms not prejudicial to any of our exist ing rights. THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT. There Was a Deficit of Nearly Seventy Millions the Past Year. The secretary of the treasury reports the receipts to this government frcm all sources of revenue during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1884, amounted to $372, 802,498.29, and its expenditures to $442,605, 758.87, leaving a deficit of $69,803,260.58. There was a decrease of $15,952,674.66 in the ordinary expenses of the government as compared With the fiscal year 1893. There was collected from customs $131,818,530.62, and from internal revenue $147,168,449.70. The balance of the income for the year, amounting to $93,615,517,97, was derived from sales of lands and other sources. The values of our total dutiable imports amounted to $275,199,086, being $146,647, 625 less than during the preceding year, and the importations free of duty amount ed to $399,705 530, being $64,748,675 less than during the preceding year. The -re ceipts from customs were $73,576,486.11 less and from internal revenue $13,836,539.77 less than in 1888./ The total tax collected from distilled spirits wis $85,259,250.35 on manufactured tobacco $8,617,898.62, and on fermented liquors $31,414,788.04.

DEPARTMENT. No Present Neoeasity For Inereaslnv*th« Army—Coast Fortifications. From the report of the secretary of war it appears that the strength of the army on Sept. 30,1884, was 2,135 officers and 25,765 enlisted men. Although this is apparently a very slight .decrease compared with the previous year, the actual effective force has been in creased to the equivalent of nearly two regiments through the reorganization ol the system of recruiting, and the conse quent release to regimental duty of the large force of men hitherto serving at the recruiting depots. The abolition of these depots, it is predicted, will furthermore effect an annual reduction approximating $250,000 in direct expenditures, besides promoting generally the health, morals uid discipline of the troops. Small Ports Abandoned* $ff The execution of the policy of concen trating the army at important centers ot population and transportation, foreshad owed in the last annual report of the sec retary, has resulted in the abandonment of 15 of the smaller, posts, whioh: was ef fected under a plan- which assembles or ganizj tio a of the same regiments hitherto widely separated.: This renders our small forces more readily effective for any serv ice which they be called upon to jterform increases the extent1of the territory under protection without diminishing the secur1 ity heretofore afforded to any locality, im proves the discipline, 'training atod esprit de corps of the army, besides considerably decreasing the cost of its maintenance.' Though the forces of the department of the East have been somewhat increased, more than three-fourths' of the army is still stationed west of the MissisSippt While the maximum legal strength of tte ianuv. 4s 25,000. men, the ... effective '•at.r«ii^lK -{c^ Various dalue^ is but little over 20,000 men,' The ptirpose of congraw •does noti therefore, seein to rhr fully Vt .tainad by thw wrist,ing wmiMMftn Whtla" no considerable incntese in the irmy is. In my judgmi •«f the policy of sea coast fortification, in the prosecution of which we .have steadily en gaged for some years, has so far devel oped as to suggest that the effective strength of the army be now made at least equal-to the legal strength. Measures' taken by the department during the year, as-indicated,v have already considerably augmented the effective force, and the secretary of war presents a plan which I recommend to the consideration of con gress to attain the desired end. Three Battalion Formation. Economies effected in the department in other lines of its work will offset to a great extent the expenditure involved in the proposition submitted. Among other things this contemplates the adoption of the three battalion formation of regiments which for several years has been indorsed by the secretaries of war and the generals commanding the army. An Allusion to Interior Disturbance*. It is hardly necessary to recall the fact that in obedience to the commands of the constitution and the laws, and for the purpose of protecting property of the United States, aiding the process of the federal courts, and removing lawless ob structions to the performance by the gov ernment of its legitimate functions, it be came necessary in various localities dur ing the present year to employ a consider able portion of the regular troops. The duty was discharged promptly, courage ously, and'with marked discretion by the officers and men, and the most gratifying proof was thus afforded that the army de serves that complete confidence in. its effi ciency and discipline which the country has at all times manifested. The year has been free from disturb ances by Indians and the chances of fur ther depredations on their part are con stantly becoming more remote and im probable. Coast Armament. The skill and industry of our ordnance officers and inventors have, it is believed, overcome the mechanical obstacles which have heretofore delayed the armament of our coasts, and this great national under taking upon which we have entered may now proceed as rapidly as congress shall determine. With a supply of finished guns of large calibre already on hand, to which addition should now rapidly follow, the wisdom of providing carriages and emplacements for their mount can not be too strongly urged. The total enrollment of the militia of the several states is 117,533 officers and en listed men, an increase of 5,346 over the number reported at the close of the pre vious year. An Honor For Schofield. In recognition of the long and distin guished military services and faithful dis charge of delicate and.' responsible civil duties by Major General John M. Scho field, now the general commanding the army, it is suggested to congress that the temporary revival of the grade of lieuten ant general in his behalf would be a just and gracious act, and would permit his re tirement, now near at hand, with rank be fitting his merits.
