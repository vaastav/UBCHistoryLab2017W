The'Newport Express and Stan dard "strains at a knat and swallows a camel" in defending Appelman.the erstwhile professor of the U. V. M. and all-the-time pro-German of the Bernstorff class. The Express and Standard says the treatment of Ap pelman would have been justified had he advocated pro-German senti ments. We say yes. Didn't he? A man sent to this country by the Im perial government of Germany to "teach and lecture" because his ser vices were more valuable to his gov ernment here than they would be on the battle front, comes pretty near sowing broadcast at every opportu nity German sentiments. He was a sneaking cur; a snake in the grass and America has been altogether too lenienc to that class of enemy aliens whe by subtlety and underhand methods have attempted to throttle democracy and stay the world-wide march of liberty and justice. It is just such men as Appelman who are putting obstacles in the way of this government, retarding war work and making greater the number of American lads who must sacrifice their Jives. We have no sympathy for Appelman. By his own words he has convicted himself as a hire ling of the Kaiser, spying out Ameri can methods, ways, means and teach ing German sentiment, aiding the German propaganda, and all for the benefit it would be to the Imperial government of Germany. Such a man is a pio-Germana fiendish ras-. cal and there is no apology called for in the treatment he has received. He ought to have been booted into the Atlantic and made to submarine it to his "Imperial Government" long before the head 'of German deviltry in this country the arch fiend Bernstorff was sent home. The local fuel committee, L. A, Cobb, A. W. Bosworth, E. M. Bart lett are earnestly working to adjust the fuel problem for this place, and their article in another column ask ing each resident of Island Pond to report their needs ior fuel should be heartily rerponded to. The fuel committe have no authority in theis line but with the co-operation of "the citizens the situation can be taken care of and every family get a sup ply of fuel. This section of the state -should not rely on coal for fuel, and certainly with the present demands for coal by the government, places where there are plenty of wood for fuel should use it and release for war work the thousands of tons heretofore coming into these sec tions. To safeguard our own needs in this matter should be sufficient reason, but at this time we have the call to serve our government and we should loyally meet the situation and do all possible to aid the fuel com mittee in their work. Congress re-convened Monday and Tuesday President Wilson delivered his message. The main work of Congress as called for, is to" win the war." "Nothing," the President says, "shall turn us aside from it until it i3 accomplished." No peace with autocracy ; but wlien the Ger man people speak through an accredi ted representative then peace will come. Never again must the peace of the world be rendered by a one- man power. The message called for a delaration of war against Austria and the House and Senate passed resolutions almost unanimously for the same. This session will likely last until the next fall elections and possibly until next December. There is trying work ahead for every mem ber and Vermonters know their dele- eation will be found loyal to the

Music, Piano, Drums and Bells government and faithfully working to bring about the desired results the Presidont has so ably outlined in his historic message. The Herald believes 'a municipal woodyard for Island Pond would be the right thing; and for that purpose urges the citizens to call a town meeting that action may be imme diately taken on this question. It would" be a matter of fue! econ omy for the churches to pool their interests so to speak and hold joint services during the winter sea son. It certainly would conserve fuel and a combination of effort ought to be good for the soul..
