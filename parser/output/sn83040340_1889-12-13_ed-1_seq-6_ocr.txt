Tho Bail road Commissioners have rendered their decision in the matter of the com plaint of the Board of Trade and salt producers of Kingman of unfair dis crimination in railroad rates on salt. The Board, after reviewing the facts in the case, say: "We are of the opinion that the salt tariffs to local points need revision in the interest of all those concerned. But this involves so many adjustments, not only as it respects the salt interests, but as well those that concern tho car riers, that its final consideration will bo entered upon at another time, and further notice to parties in interest. "Upon tho complaint before us wo find and decide that tho rate on salt from Kingman, Anthony and Welling ton should be the same to all Missouri river points as the rate on like com modities from Hutchinson, Nickerson and Sterling, and the board directs and orders that such rates be made uuifoun from all the points above named. "The Ixvird also finds that the fuel used in tho manufacture of salt is slack coal supplied from the coal mines of Southeastern Kansas. The cost of this per ton delivered at Wellington is S2.45, and the freight rate is $1.70; at King man, $2.65, and the freight rate $2; at Anthony $2.75 per ton, and the freight rate $2, and Hutchinson $2.40 per ton and freight rate $1.80. We think that in justice to so important an industry as the salt manufacture in this State a concession should be made on these rates as follows: "Rato on coal slack to Wellington $1.30 per ton and to all the other points of salt manufacture in the State $1.50 per ton. And believing under existing circumstances that these rates would be fair and reasonable tho board or ders and directs that these rates on coal slack, together with uniform rates on salt to Missouri river points, be adopted and made effectivo upon all railroads operating to any of tho points named by December 15, 18S9."

MONEYSAVED. What the Missouri Stnte Board Has Saved to tire People. Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 8. Mr. Downing, of the State Railroad Com mission, says that a singlo decision of tho Commission rendered in a coaf case several months ago, in which this city was interested, save3 to the city $750, 000 a year. The figures weregiven him by Georgo 11. Nettleton, who is one of the most thorough railroad ac countants in the country. Ac cording to tho decision tho coal rate was reduced from 55 to 35 cents per ton. Mr. Downing claims that tho State Railroad Commissioners have saved the people millions of dol lars since thebotly was called into ex istence. As to the effect of Missouri river transportation upon freight rates ho was not prepared to talk, but thought the importance of tho enter prise has been greatly. overrated.

It is a curious fact that the wife of Mr. Chandler, ex-Secretary of the Navy, should have been a daughter ol a former Senator Hale, while the wife of Senator Hale of the present day is a daughter of a former Secretary of the Navy Chandler. No relationship exists between the families. One has a son named Hale Chandler and the other a son named Chandler Hale. The Southern cotton crop aggregate is estimated at 7,124,000 bales.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Harrison's First Mossoffo to Congress. Our Cordial Foreign Relations Rerom- meodntlons as to Tariff Revision Tue Surplus, Pensions and Other Matters Discussed. WAsnixoTON, Dee. 4. The President's mes sage whs received in both houses ot Congress yesterday at noon and Is pimclpally as fol lows: To the Striate atvl JToiue of Veprttentatlcu: Few transactions In the administration ot government are even temporarily held In the confidence of those charged with the conduct of public business. Kvery Btep taken Is under the observation ot nn Intelli gent and watchful people. The state ot the Union is known from day to day and sugges tions as to needed legislation find an earlier voice than that which speaks in these an nual communications of the President to Congress. Goodwill and cordiality have character ized our relations and correspondence with other Governments, and tho year closed leaves few international questions of Impor tance unadjusted. No obstacle Is believed to exist that can long postpone the consider ation and adjustment ot still pending ques tions upon satisfactory and honorable terms. The dealings of this Government with other States have been marked by frankness and sincerity, our purposes avowed and our methods free from intrigue. This course has borne rich fruit In tho past, and It Is our duty as a Nation to preserve the heritage of good repute which a century ot right dealing wUh foreign Governments has secured to us. It Is a matter of significance and no less ot congratulations that the first year ot the second century of our constitutional exist ence finds as honored guests within our bor ders the representatives of all the Independ ent States of North and South America met together in earnest oonferenco touching the best methods ot perpetuating and expand ing the relations of mutual Interest and friendliness existing among them. That tho opportunity thus afforded for pro moting closer international relations and tho Increased prosperity ot the States repre sented will be used for tho mutual good of all I can not permit myself to doubt. Our people will await with Interest and con fidence the results to flow from sonuspiclous a meeting of allied and in large part identical Interest". Recommendations of this International conference of enlightened statesmen will have the attention ot Congress and its co operation In theremovalof unnecessary bar riers between tho Nations of America. But while tho commercial results which It Is JTopcd v III follow thlsconfcrcncc are worthy of praise and tho great Interest they have cAelted, it Is believed tho crowning bcnctlt will be found in the better securities which may be devised for the maintenance of peace among nil American Nations and settlement of all contentions by methods Christian civilization can approve. While viewing with Interest our National resources and products, the delegates, I Bin sure, will find a higher satisfaction In the evidences of un selfish friendship which everywhere attends the Intercourse with our people. An international marine conference, hav ing great possibilities for good, has lately assembled and is now in session in this cap ital. An Invitation was extended by the Gov ernment, under the act of Congress of July 9, l&x, to all marltimo nations tb send delegate1) to confer touching the revision und amendment of the rules and regulations governing vcssols and to adopt a uniform system of marlno signals. Tho response to this invitation has been very general and very cordial. Dele gates from twenty-six Nations are present In the conference nnd they have entered upon their useful work with great zeal and with an evident appreciation of Its Importance. So far as tho agreement to be reached may require legis lation to give It effect the co-operation of Con gress Is confidently relied upon. It is an In teresting and unprecedented fact that the two international conferences have brought here the accredited representatives of Hilrty thrce Nations. Bolivia, Ecuador und Hon duras are now represented by resident en voys of the plenipotentiary grade. AH the etates of the American system now maintain diplomatic relations at this capital. 

RELATIONS WITH CHINA. Our relations with China have tho attcn tintive consideration which their magnitude nnd Interest demand. The failure of the treaty negotiated under my predecessor for the further und more complete restriction of Cbfcese labor. Immigration nnd with It the legislation of the last session of Congress dependent thereon leaves somo questions open which Congress should now approach in that wise and Just spirit which should characterize the relations of two great and friendly powers, while oursupreinc interests demand the exclusion of a laboring clement which experience has shown to be incom patible with our social life. All steps to compass this imperative need should be accompanied with u recognition of the claim of those strangers now lawfully among us to humano and Just treatment. The acces sion of the young Kmpcror of China marks, we may hope, an era of progress and pros perity "for the great country over which he Is called to rule. SAMOAN AFFAIRS. Tho present state of affairs in respect to tho Samoan Islands Is encouraging. The conference which was held In this city In tho summer of 1SSS between tho representatives of tho United States, Germany and Great Britain had been ad journed because ot the persistent divergence of views which was developed In Its delib erations. Tho subsequent course of events In the islands gave rise to questions of a seri ous character. On the 4th of FVVuury last the German Minister at this capital in behalf of his Government proposed a resumption of the conference at Berlin. This proposi tion was accepted, as Congress in February last was Informed. Pursuant to the under standing thus reached commissioners were appointed by me, by and with the advice and consent of tho Senate, who proceeded to Ber lin and the conference was resumed. The deliberations extended through several weeks and resulted In the conclusion ot a treaty which will be submitted to the Senate for its approval. 

BRITISH AFFAIRS. The questions which havo arisen during the past few years between Great Britain and the United States are in abeyance or in course of adjustment. On the part of tho Government of the Do minion of Can a la an effort has been ap parent during the season just ended to ad minister the laws and regulations applicable to the fisheries with as little occasion for friction as was possible, and the temperate repressions of this Government In re spect of cases of undue hardship or of harsh representations have in most cases been met with measures ot transitory relief. It Is trusted that the attainment of our just rightx under existing treaties and by virtue of the concurrent legislation of the two contiguous countries will uot be long delayed and that all existing cause of differences may be equitably adjusted. OTIIKU FOREIGN QUESTIONS. The Importance of the commerce of Cuba and Porto Rico with the United States, their nearest and principal market, Justifies the expectation that the existing relations may be beneficially expanded. Tphe Impediments resulting from varying dues on navigation and from the vexatious treatment of our ves sels on merely technical grounds of com plaints in West India port, should be re moved. The progress toward an adjustment of pending claims between the United States and Spain is not so rapid as could bedesired. Questions affecting American interests In connection with railways constructed and operated by ourcitlzens in Peru have claimed the attention of this Government. It Is urged that other Governments In pressing Peru to the payment of their claims have disre garded the property rights of American citi zens. The matter will be carefully investi gated with a view to securing a proper and equitable adjustment. A similar Issuo Is now pending with Portugal. The Delagoa Bay railway in Africa was constructed under a concession by Portugal to an American citizen. When nearly completed the road was seized by the agents of the Portuguese Government. For mal protest has been made through our Minister at Lisbon against this act and no proper effort will bo spared to secure proper relief. In pursuance of the charter granted by Congress and under tho terms of Its contract with the Government of Nicaragua the Inter-Oceanic Canal Company has begun the construction of the Important waterway be iweer the two oceans. , The traditional good feeling between tbU country and the French Bepubllc has re ceived additional testimony In tho participa tion of our Government and people In thtf International Exposition held at Paris dur ing the pjst summer. The success) of our exhibitors has been gratifying. The reports) of tho Commission will bo laid boforo Con gress In duo season. With Germany tho most cordial relations exist. The questions arising from the return to the Empire of Gcrmansnatunilized In till country are considered and disposed of in temperate spirit to the entire satisfaction ot both Governments. a A mixed commission is now In session In this capital for settlement ot long-standing; claims against tho Itepubltc of Venezuela, and ft is hoped that a satisfactory conclusion will bo speedily reached. ,; Questions continue to arise ntonr relations with several countries In respect to the rights ot naturalized citizen. Especially ls Ihls the case with France, Italy, Russia andTurkey and to a less extent with Switzer land. From time to timeearncsteffortshavo been made to regulate this subject by con ventions. An improper use of niturallzatloa should not be permitted, but it hi Important that those who havo been duly naturalized should everywhere be accorded recognition, of the rights pertaining to citizenship ot tho country of their adoption. Tho appropria tions of special conventions for that purpose Is recognized in treaties which this Govern ment has concluded with a number of Euro pean States, nnd it Is ndvisable that the dim cutties which now arise in our relations with, other countries on the same subject should be similarly adjusted. The recent revolution in Brazil In favor of tho establishment of a republican form ot government is an event of gTeat Interest to the United States, Our Minister at Rio Janeiro was at once instructed to maintain friendly diplomatic relations with the Pro visional Government and tho Brazilian representatives at tho capital were instruct ed by the Provisional Government to con tinue their functions. Our friendly inter course with Brazil has thcrtfarcauffered no Interruption. Our Minister has been further instructed to extend on tho part ot this Government a format and cordial recogni tion ot the new republic so soon as M majority of the people of Brazil shall havo signified their assent to iU establishment and maintenance. Home Matters. Within our own borders a general condi tion of prosperity prevails. Tho harvests of the last summer were exceptionally abun dant and the trade conditions now prevail ing seem to' promise a successful1 season to nic merchant nnd themanuf.icturcrand gen eral employment to our working people. THE TREASURY. The report of the Socretary of the Treasury fortlic fiscal year ended Juno 30, 180, ha been prepared and will be presented to Con gress with the fiscal operations ot the Gov ernment, and I nvail myself of It to obtain some facts for use here. Tho nggregate re ceipts from all sources for tho year were $3$7,050,059.S4. Itwasdcrived as follows: From customs, J?J3,v52,74l.CS; from Internal reve nue, $130,82,513.92: from miscellaneous sources, $32,335,S03.23. The ordinary expenditures for tho same period were $2sl,9W,G15.60, and tho total ex penditures, Including the sinking fund, were $329,579,929.25. The excess of receipts over expenditures was, after providing for the sinking fund, $57,170,129.59. For the current fiscal year the total revenues, actual and estimated, aro $395,000,000, and the "ordinary expenditures, actual und estimated, are $293,000,000, making, with the sinking fund, a totnl expenditure of $34121,111.91), leaving ait estimated surplus of $43,C78,moi. During the fiscal year there was applied to the purchase of bonds, In addltibn to these, for the sinking fund $90,4M72.35, and during: the lfrst quarter of the current year tho sum of $37,83S,937.77, alt of which was credited to the sinking fund. The revenues for tho fiscal year ending June 20, 1891, are estimated ty the treasury department at $385,000,000, nnd tho expendi tures for the same period, including the sinking fund, at $341,430,477.70. This shows 'an estimated surplus for that year of $43, ZOifiSiM; which Is more likely to be Increased than reduced when the actual transaction aro written up. the BURrtns. The existence ot so largo an actual and an ticipated surplus should have the immedi ate attention of Congress with a view to re ducing the receipts of tho treasury to the needsof the Government ns closely as m-iy be. The collection of moneys not needed for public uses Imposes an unnecessary harden upon our people und the presence ot so large a surplus In the public vaults is a disturbing, clement In the conduct of prlvato business It has called Into use expedients for putting, it Into circulation of very questionably pro priety. We should not collect revenue for the purpose of anticipating our bonds be yond the requirement of the sinking fundr but any unappropriated surplus In the treas ury should be so used, ns thero Is no other lawful way of returning the money to cir culation, and the profit realized by the Gov ernment offers a substantial advantage. The loaning of public funds to the banks without Interest, upon tlKj security of Gov eminent bonds, I regard as an unauthorized and dangerous expedient. It results In a temporary nnd unnatural Increase of the banklng capital of favorod localities and. compels a cautious and gradual recall of the deposits to avoid injury to tho commercial Interests. It is not to be expected that the banks having these deposits wilL sell their bonds to the treasury so long us the present highly beneficial arrangement is continued. They now practically get interest both upon tho bonds nnd their proceeds. No further uso should bo made or this method of getting tho surplus into circulation, and the deposits now out standing should be gradually withdrawn, and applied to tba purchase of bonds. It I fortunatc that such uso can be made of the existing surplus, nnd for somo time to come ot any casual surplus that may exist, after Congress has taken the necessary step tor a reduction of the revenue. Such legis lation should bo promptly but very consid erately enacted. 

TTIE TARIFF. I recommend a revision of our tariff law,, both In its administrative features and In the schedule. The need of the former is gencrally conceded, and an agreement upon the evils and inconveniences to he remedied, and tne best methods for their correction will probably not be difficult. Unlformlty ot valuation at all our ports is essential, and. effective measures should bo taken to securo it. It is equally desirable that qui'Stlbns affecting rates and classifications should bo promptly decided. The preparation of a new schedule of cus tom duties is u matter of great delicacy, be cause of Its effect upon the buslness of the country; of great difficulty, by reason ot the wide divergence ot opinion as to the objects that may be promoted by such legislation. Some disturbance of busi ness may perhaps result from consideration of this subject by Congress, but this tempo rary ill-effect will be reduced to a minimum, by prompt action, und the assurance which the couutry enjoys that nny necessary changes will be so made as not to impair tho just and reasonable protection of our home industries. The ineqalitles of the law should be adjusted, but the protective prin ciple should be maintained and fairly np plled to the products of our farms as well as of our shops. These duties necessarily have relation to other things besides public rev enues. We can not limit their effects by fix ing our eyes on the public treasury alone. They have a direct relation to home produc tion, to work, to wages and to the commer cial Independence of our country, and the wise and patriotic legislator should enlarge the fluid of his vision to include all of these. The necessary reduction in our public rev enues can, I am sure, be made without mak- ingthe smaller burden more onerous than the larger by reason of the dsabltles and limitations which the process of reduction puts upon both capital and labor. The free list can very safely be extended by placing: thereon articles that do no; offerMnjurloua competition to such domestic products as our home labor can supply. The removal ol the internal tax upon tobat-o would relieve an Important agricultural product from a bnrden which was Imposed only because out revenue from custom duties was Insufllclent for the public needs. If safe provision can be devised, the re moval of the tax upon spirits used In the arts and manufactures would offer an un objectionable method of reducing the sur plus. ' THE CIRCEUraON. A table presented by the Secretary of th Treasury showing the amount of money ol all kinds in circulation each year from 1573 tc the present tlmo is ot interest It appear that the amount of National bonk: notes In circulation has decreased daring that period $114,103,729, ot which $37,799,229 is chargeable to the last year. The withdrawal ot bank circulation will necessarily continue under existing condi tions. It is probable the adoption- ot th suggestions made by th CsaijitroUir, Thy i ' u M
