THE RIVER PRESS Wednesday, December 14, 1881. JERRY COLLINS. - -- - - -- - - EDITOR NEBRASKA wants 600,000 acres from Dakota. CGL. FORNEY, editor of Forney's Progress, of Philadelphia,. is dead. A BILL has been introduced by Senator Windom for a Garfield Memorial Hospital. THE Guiteau case is still dragging along, and the loquacious fiend is keeping up his lick as a talker. IT is reported that a new paper is about to be started in Butte, to be called .ind Words: Is it one of Freeman's ? GEN. H. B. BANNING, of Cincinnati, an ex member of Congress, died suddenly and un expectedly on the 10th inst. SENATOR BECK has introduced a bill for the retirement of the trade dollar from circula tion and the re-coinage of standard silver dollars. LoGAN has introduced a bill in the U. S. Senate to place Gen. Grant on the retired list of the army. Does the country still owe Grant a debt? THE Northern Pacific railroad will reach Rosebud by the first of the new year. The forward march of the iron horse into Mon is a steady one. THE burning of the theatre at ,Vienna turns out to be a more horrible affair than was at first supposed. It is thought a thous and persons perished. A. RUMSEY NININGER, a prominent mer chant of Miles City, has failed with liabili ties amounting to $250,000. The assetsare unknown. St. Paul merchants lose heavily. RIDDLEBERGER will be elected U. S. Sena tor from Virginia. Only recently he was a candidate for door-keeper before that body. The august Senate is fast losing its dignity. GEN. KILPATRIOK, who achieved an envi able reputation during the war as a dashing cavalry leader, died at Santiago, Chili, to which place he was U. S. Minister, last week. IT seems that Bozeman's new paper has at last materialized and the first number will be issued on Jan. 4. The Gallatin News is the name of the new publication, and Chas. A. Carson the editor. It will be Democratic in politics. CHAS. S. WARREN, of Siiver Bow county, is at Washington seeking to be appointed Secretary of the Territory. The appoint ment will be made in a few days, and we will wager a pint of peanuts that a Montana man does not get there. A FIRE at Minneapolis, on the 4th inst. destroyed $558,000 worth of mill property, and caused the death of four men. The mills burned were the Pittsburg B. flouring mill, the Excelsior mill, the Empire mill, the Minnesota mill and a cotton mill. CALIFoRNIA has quarantined against Chi cago, from fear of small-pox. There were forty-nine deaths last week in that city from the disease, and there are also a number of cases reported in St. Louis, and fears are en tertained of an epidemic. THERE are numerous applicants for the office of Secretary of Montana, both in the Territory and inthe East. If Secretary Mills is not desirous of re-appointment to the office which he has so satisfactorily filled, we hope that some other Montana man will be chosen. There is good enough timber in th0 country for any Territorial office, and'it can be filled more acceptably to the people by one of their own numberithan by any political: hanger-, on from the States. THE suCCess which Messrs. Lorillard and Keene hade met within 7Enland diuringthe past season has encouraged others to emulate their example. Among the notes in the turf world is the assertion that Mr. Charles Reed is teaching the famous filly, ";Th~ora," 'to jump, and that he will take her across theb water in the spring and to win. ithe Graind National Steeplechase, oneqf the nstijm portant races in the old countiy. *T1oia is a filly of rare; speed on the flat, apnd has- beaten such first-class' hdres s Crickm6re, Ch. ieck mate and Monitorj If 'she .ke kiddly to jumping her chances for the Grand National JAMEs W.

The full text of this important and inter esting state paper has not yet come to hand. Until the Eastern Papers arrive, Montana must be content with a brief synopsis of the document. As far as we can judge of the whole by a part the message is a creditable one and fulltof wise suggestions. It is to be hoped the -present Congress will pay some heed to the important recommendations made, and not, as has been so often the case, waste their valuable time is petty partisan wrangles. Following are some of the sub jects discussed with the President's views in the premises: The message opens with a proper refer ence to the appalling calamity that has re cently befallen the American, people, in the death of ,their beloved. President, and the; general prosperity that has, otherwise, attend ed the nation. Extended reference is made to the diplo matic relations of the United States with other nations, showing that we are at peace, and in fact, on the best kind of terms, with the rest of the civilized world. President Arthur takes occasion to affirm the Monroe doctrine, and DeLesseps and company will find no consolation in his remarks on the Isthmus canal project. The words quoted are all we find in the synopsis before us in reference to the Indian questibn, and it shows that the action of the Stock. Protective Association of Choteau and Meagher counties has been productive of good results. But for the prompt and deter mined part taken by the Association it is probable the following wc uld not have been a part and parcel of the message: "The sur render of Sitting Bull and his force upon the Canadian frontier has allayed all apprehen sions, although bodies of hostile Indians, still cross the border in quest of sustenance. Up on this subject a correspondence has been opened which promises an adequate under standing. Our troops have orders, mean while, to avoid all collisions with alien Indi ants." It is to be hoped that the "adequate understanding" may be arrived at shortly. It is certainly time that the government weire taking some notice of the depredations com mitted on our soil by British Indians, result ing in the loss of thousands of dollars annual ly to the stockmen of Northern Montana alone. A revision of the tariff laws are recom mended, and in order to avoid a confltct of different interests due caution is urged. If the work cannot be done this session of Con gress the appointment of a commission on re vision is suggested. The report of the Secretary of War, rec ommending that the number 'of enlisted men in the army be increased to 80,000, without increasing the number of officers, is concur red in by the President and Congress urged to make provision to that effect. The report of the Postmaster General is pronounced a gratitying exhibit of the growth and efficiency of the postal service. The receipts from postal and other ordinary sources during the past fiscal year were $86, 489,815.68 receipts from money order busi ness, $295,581.39. The total expenditures for the service were $39,251,736. 46, leaving a deficit to be supplied out of the Treasury of $2,481,129,35-just about the amount stolen by the Star Route thieves. Strange to say the President overlooks the latter alto gether. The twin relic, Mormonism, comes in for a good share of attention. For the past twenty years or more every message of every President has recommendedthe rooting out of polygamy,but nothing of the kind has been done. Whatever-action has been taken by Congress has proved futile, Instead of be ing rooted out, the tree of Mormon ism has flourished, and its roots have now taken hold in the soil of other Territories than Utah. Congress has not been decisive enough. The President-does not make.~ny important suggestions in the premises and it is probable, as heretofore, no action what ever will be taken this session. Legislation with respect to the ascertain ment and declaration 'of the Eresidenitiai.vote is urged so that another itional: election may not come around with this question un settled., He also recommends that the ques tion of "Presidential inabiliLy," so much dis ssed.urng:g the illness of: :the late Presi dent,be clearly defined by statute or other W8se. If aI:ytIng is said upon .the hackneyed the!ie of civil service'reform, the synopsis at and does net indicate it. Hayefs evoted half of his ~&tfirt message to this subject and t is .~r.ble . civil service was never more debaucehie than during his administra tion-o. Iti~ pr.obable MrAr r.Brlr concuaded he wold not preach ,something he has no idea of practicing. Wh. s the message in. full comes to hand we may find other 'topicd' Promid..t1tite President's Message. F'orm inany yewar past the Execuftive inbhis annual m~esaIgeto COngress bhas called attdu ton to "the ifecessity of strong legislation for hsonipoygamy inthe Territorp for te pnihmnent of this odious' crime, 'so i atw a in :ver rare instances been enforced,and from causes to which reference will presently be made,is practically a dead letter. The fact 'that the adherents of the Mormon Church,which rests upon polygamy as its corner stone, have re -cently been peopling in large numbers, Idaho Arizona and other of our Western Territor ies, is well calculated to excite the liveliest interest and apprehension. It imposes upon Congress and the! Executive, the duty of bringing against this barbarous system all the power which under the Constitution and laws they can wield for its destruction. Ref erence has been already made to the obstruc tions then United States odicers have >en countered in their efforts to punish the vio lators of the lav ' Prominenit among the ob stacles is the difficulty of procuring legal evi dence suffitient to warrant a donviction. even 'in the case'of the ihost notorious offenders. Your attention is called to thedecision of the Supreme Court of the United States,explain ing its judgment of reversation in the; case of Miles, who had been convicted of polyga my in Utah. The court refers to ,the.fact that the' secrecy attending. the celebration of marriages in that Territory makes that part of polygamy very difficult, and the propriety is suggested of modifying the law of evidence which now makes a wife incompetent to tes tify against her husband. The suggestion is approved, and I recommend also the passage of an act providing that in the Territories of the United States the fact that a woman who has been married to a person charged with bigamy, shill not disqualify her as a witness upon his trial for that offense. I fur ther recommend legislation by which any person solemnizin:g a marriage in any of the Territories shall be required, under stringent penalties for neglect or refusal, to file a cer tificate of such marriage in the Supreme Court of the Territory, unless Congress may devise other practicable measures for obvia ting the difficulties which have uhitherto at tended the efforts to suppress this iniquity..I assure you of my determined purpose to co operate with you in any lawful and discreet measures which may be proposed to that end. No Complaint. 

WASHINGTGN, December 9.-Second As sistant Postmaster-General Elmer says. that not a single Congressman has complained of, the reductions of 8:ar routes or asked for a reinstatement of curtailed routes. The Star route ring had predicted an onslaught by Western Congressmen because of the action, of the Department in cutting down the Star routes. Elmer says Congressmen recognize the jnstice of the action of the Department by which the Star routes have been cut down. Cabinet Rumors. WAsImNGTON, December 9.-There is a re port that Hunt will remain in the Cabinet in his present position. One of his closest closest friends says the talk of the President to Hunt has been of a character to retain him. Hunt expects to remain. He said this morning that ,the talk that he will get Bancroft Davis' place on the Court of Claims is untrue, and he would not accept, if he was offered, the circuit judgeship made vacant by the appointment of Judge Woods to the Supreme Bench by Prefident Garfield before the latter was shot. Present indications are that Hunt will remain in the Cabinet for a few months longer at least. A gVienna Holocaust. VIIsNNA, December 9.-From the ruins of the Ring Theatre, burned last night, 270 bodies have been recovered. The fourth gal lery has not yet been explored. It is believ ed that not a single person escaped from that gallery and that very few escaped from the third gallery. The corpses last recovered are little more than charred fragments. Gross neglect is charged against the manage-. ment of the theatre. The law prescribes the use of oil lamps in the corridors of the the aters, so that. exits shall be discernable in the event of the failure of gas, but this pre cautibn was utterly neglected. The person in charge of the iron curtain between the stage and auditorium appears to have fled at the first alarm, The Utl - iDelegaieship. INzw YoRxK,
