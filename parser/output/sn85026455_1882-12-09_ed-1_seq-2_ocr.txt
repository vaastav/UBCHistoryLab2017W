There were in 1880 1,943 manufac tories of agricultural implements in the United States with the invested capital -of $02,109,068. The number of hands employed was 39,580.

The Sunday law was enforced at New York, Sunday, with a strictness that sur prised the residents. Street venders of all commodities, newspapers included, were arrested, and in Brooklyn the drug t.orea were closed. The barber shops ,were closed, and tonsorial artists in hotels were kept busy, as outsiders who wished to be shaved, claimed to be guests The street cars were not running, and express drivers, if found violating the law, were taken in. Projectors of sacred concerts fared in a similar way. General Raum, Commissioner of In ternal Revenue, has submitted his report 4othe Secretary of the Treasury. He hows that taxation by internal revenue has increased from $113,000,000 in 1879 to $146,500,000 in 1881, and estimates the receipts for the year at $145,000,000 He believes the revenue should be re duced from $60,000,000 to $70,000,000 an nually, and that if they are continued at the present rate the Treasury would contain a surplus in short time which would necessitate the purchase of bonds the demand for which by the government would enhance their value at the cost of the people. He thinks the duty on sugar, now amounting to $45,000,000 yearly, should be abolished, and that home producers, as an offset to the loss of protection, be given a bounty of 2 cents on each pound manufactured. The Commissioner estimates the stock of dis tilled spirits in bond as about equal to six years consumption, and thinks an extension of the bonded period is a press ing want of the trade. As the manu facturers, to avoid withdrawal of their Sroperty, and consequent payment of axes, are thinking of exporting their whisky, and then reimporting it and storing it in customs bonded warehouses, General Raum is of the opinion that leg islative relief could be afforded with safety, without putting the manufactur ers to this outlay.

To give all the news without indulging in of fensive Rensationalism; to be courageous and aggressive in the advocacy of well-established principle, without being narrow-minded or un fair, to cater to the tastes of all classes of in telligent readers, without pandering to the prejudices of any; to present in most attractive form the greatest variety of matter, without cur tailing or lowering the standard of any depart ment; to grow in interest aud excellence with each succeeding year of its existence, is to be the model newspaper. From the first it has been the aim of the pub lishers of The Inter Ocean to have the paper reach this high standard, and in each of t he ten years of its existence a notable step for ward has h.-en taken. As every change has met with encouraging response from the pub lic in the shape of increased patronage, it is fair to assume that the efforts of the publishers have been in the right direction, aud have been ap preciated. The Inter Ocean will remain uncompromis ingly Rhpublican, will maintain its present at titude of protecting American industries; will continue to devote special attention to trade, transportation, and economic questions; will retain the departments of the Curiosity Shop (a current encyclopedia of curious, interesting and valuable information, called out by inquiries of subscriber) ; The Woman's Kingdom (de voted to the progressive movements In wldch women are interested ) ; The Farm and Home (covering topics of special interest to farmers, tiieil wives and their children): The Veterinary (containing answers to questions as to the treatment of horses, cattle, and other animals by one of the best veterinary surgeons in the West); and Complications (taking in puzzles, enigmas, conundrums, etc. ) all of wldch are peculiar to the paper; will give as much space as hitherto to serial and short stories, original and selected sketches, and poems, and with in creased facilities for news gathering in the shape of special wires to New York and Wash ington, and experienced correspondents well placed at home and abroad, will more than maintain its high standard for enterprise and accuracy in all departments of news. The Inter Ocean, always closely identified with the interests of the West, has led in the work of development of both the Nortwest and Southwest, and it will;continue to make promi nent the characteristic features of the progress of the newer communities toward statehood. No paper in the country has given so much at tention to immigration movements, railway and canal enterprises, race and economic problems, and other topics relating to the prosperity of the older states and the development of the newer sections as The Inter Ocean. The aim has been to make it the best paper for citJjfciliiirhan. or country reader; the best papeiVtho business man and his family; the best fr the strong partisan as well as the generafTeader; and as the circulation of the sev eral editions has Increased more rapidly the past year than in any previous year, and as it is now larger than that of any other paper west of New York City, the publishers, feeling that they have fair measure of popular approval, will continue In the course marked out, making such improvements as will keep The Inter Ocean at the head of the list of American tournals as the model newspaper. The circulation is host shown by the amount of postage paid on the papers sent to actual subscribers.
