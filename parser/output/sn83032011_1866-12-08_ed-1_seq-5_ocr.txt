STATES. w&In my message of tho fourth of De eniber, 1805, Congress was informed of Tlic measures which had been instituted iby lite Executive with a view to the 'gradual restoration of the States in jAVhleh tiie insurrection occurred to their relations with the Ueneral Government, provisional Governors liad been appoint Td, conventions called, Governors elect ed, Legislatures assembled, and Senators and Representatives chosen to tho Con- grcss of tlio United States. Courts had vbecn opened for the enforcement of laws llong In abeyance. The blockade had sheen removed, custom-houses rc-cstab- llishcd, nnd tho internal revenue laws ;tput in force, in order that tho people (Might contribute to tho national income. -Postal operations had been renewed, '".nnd efforts were being made to restore Ith'em to their former condition of ofli- ' jciency. The States themselves laid been Tasked to take part in the high function 'ofiunending tho Constitution, and thus sanctioning the extinction of African isliivery as one of tho legitimate results of our internecine struggle. Ml la vine- progressed thus far, tho Exec ytivo Department found that it had ac complished nearly all that was within th"o seopo of ltd constitutional authority. One thing, however, yet remained to be dime before tho work of restoration 'cb'uld be completed, and that was tho admission to Congress of loyal Senators and Representatives from the .States whoso people had rebelled against tho lawful authority of tho General Govern jjuciu. xiuft 4UC0UUU uuvun uu upu or L III . . l...tf.l.....l ,,'tho respective Houses, which, by tho 4CoHstitution, tiro made the judges of ,tho elections, returns, and qualifications of their own members ; and its consid eration at once engaged the attention of Congress. t'lu the meantime tho Executive Dc p'artment no other plan having been proposed by Congress continued Its ef forts to purfect, as far as was practicable, the restoration of tho proper relations Iwjtween tho citizens of tho respective States, tho States, and tho Federal GOV' ,-iernment, extending, from time to time, 'as the public interests seemed to require, tho judicial, revenue, and postal sys tems of the country. With tho advico 'and consent of theSenate, the necessary . officers wore appointed, and appropria tions nmdu by Congress for the payment of their salaries. Tho proposition to amend tho Federal Constitution so as to . prevent the existenco of slavery within stho United States, or any place subject ' to their jurisdiction, was ratilied by the .requisite number of States; and on tho eighteenth day of December, 1805, it , was otllcialiy declared to have becomo valid im a part of the Constitution of tho United States. Allof thoStatesln which - file insurrection hnd existed promptly amended their constitutions so as to mako them conform to tho great change fluirf effected in tho organic law of tho land ; declared null and void all ordi nances and laws of secession; repudiated 'all pretended debts and obi Igatlonscreat edifor tho revolutionary purpose of the .Insurrection; and proceeded In good faith louioeiiaciiiieiii ui miMaim-a wi iiiu jnir ecTluu mid amelioration of tho condi tion of tho colored race. Congress, how ever, yet hesitated to admit any of thes States to representation ; and it was not until toward tho closo of the eighth inouth of tho session that nn exception ..Wwiis mado in favor of Tennessee, by tho admlssIon of her Senators and Kopresen tatlves. NON'-AIMIS3lOX OK I.OVAh JUIIMU-SUN TATIVJ3. 1 deem It as a subject of profound re gret that Congress has thus far failed I fadinlt to seats loyal Senators and Ilei fresentatlves from thootherStates.who'-e JinhabUants, with thoso of Tennessee, "had engaged In tho Rebellion. Ten States more than ono fourth of tne 'yiiolo number remain without ropre sentatlou ; tho seats of fifty members i tho IIoiiso of Representatives, and o twenty members in tho Senate, are ye acant not by their own con'-ent, not by a failure- oreloctlon, but by tho rofus ul of Congress to accopt their credential Their admisjion, it Is believed, woul uvo aecomplblivd much towaul tho re uewnlniid strengthening of our relations as 0110 peoplo, and removing serious cause for discontent on the part of the Inhabitants of thoso States. It would have accorded With tho great principle cnunektod in the Declaration of Amer ican Independence, that no peoplo ought to bear the burden of taxation, nnd yet bo denied tho right of representation. It would have been In consonance with the express provisions of the Constitu tion, that " each Stntoshall have at least ono Representative," nnd that " no State, without its consent, shall be de prived of its equal sulTrage In tlicJSou ate." These provisions were intended to secure to every State, and to the peo ple of every Htate,the right of rcprcseutn; tion in each House of Congress; and so important was it deemed by the frnttfVrs of tho Constitution that the equality of tho States In the Senate should be pre served, that not evemby nn amendment of the Constitution can any State, with out Its consent, be denied a volco In that branch of the XatlonaMiCgislature. HTATE3 AltlANOT COXO.UE11EI) Tll'llKl TOIllES. , . It Is true, it has been assumed that the existence of tho States was terminated by 'the rebellious acts of their luhubl 'twits, and .that the Insurrection having been suppressed, they were thencefor ward to bo considered merely nsconquer- edTcrrltorles. TliolegisIatlve,cxecutlve, ant! Judicial departments of the Govern ment have, however, with great dis tinctness and uniform consistency, re- i.ed to sanction an assumption .-o in compatible with tho nature, of our re publican system, and wijh the professed Djecisoi 1110 war. xnrougiioui mo re cent legislation of Congress, tho mule- able fact makes itself apparent that these ten political communities are noth- loss than States of this Union. At e, .ery eonimencenient of thu Rebel- liinTcach i louse declared, with a iinan- mlty as rcmarKnblc as It was slgnlll- cant, tliat tho war was not " waged upon our part in a spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjuga- on, nor forany purposeof overthrowing or interfering with the rights orestablisli ed institutions of those States, but to de fend andjnalntaln the supremacy of tho Coustititutlon and nil laws made in pur suance thereof, nnd to preserve the Union lthall the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired ; and that as soon ns those objects" were "ac complished tho war ought to cease." In some instances Senntors were permitted to continue their legislative functions, bile in other instances Representa tives wcro elected and admitted to seats after their States had formally do ired their right to withdraw from tho Union, and were endeavoring to inaiu- taiu that right by forco of arms. All f the States whoso peoplo wero In In surrcction, as States, wero included in 10 apportionment of the direct tax of twenty millions of dollars annually laid upon tho United Sates by tho act approv ed August fifth, 1801. Congress, by the act of March fourth, 18G2, and by tho tip ortioumcnt of representation therciiU' der, also recognized their presence as States in the Union ; and they have, for judicial purpo.-es, been divided Into dis tricts, as States alone can be divided The same recognition appears In tho re- cent legislation in reference to Tennessee, hich evidently rests upon tho fact that tho functions of tho State were not de- strovedby the Rebellion, but merely sus ponded ; and that principle is, of cour.-e, applicable to those States which, like Tennessee, attempted to renounco their places In tho Union. Tho action of tho Kxecutivo Depart mcnt of tho Government upon this sub ject has been equally deflnlto and uni form, and the purpose of tho war was specifically stated in the proclamation ssued by my predecessor on the twenty second day of September, 1802. It was then solemnly proclaimed and declared that " hereafter, as heretofore, tho war will bo prosecuted for the object of prac tically restoring tho constitutional re. ation between tho United States and each of tho States and tho people there of, In which States that relation is o may bo suspended or disturbed." Tho recognition of thu States by tho Judicial Department of tho Govern mcnt has also been clear and conclusive all proceedings affecting them as states, had in tho Supremo, Circuit nnd District Courts. NO DAXGKIl IN ADMITTING! IlIU'Ili: HKNTATI VP.S. In tho admission of Senators and Representatives from any und all of tho States, thero can be no Just ground of np. prehension that persons who are disloy al will be clothed with tho powers of legislation; for this could not happen when the Constitution and tho laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Con gres. Each Houso Is mado tho "judge of tho elections, returns, and qualifica tions of Its own members," and may, with tho coucurroneo of two thirds, expel a membor." When a Senator or Representative pre.-ents his certifi cate of election, ho may at once be adml.ted or jejected ; or, should thero bo any question as to his eligibility, his credentials may bo referred for Investi gation to theapproprlate committee. If admitted to a seat, It must bo upon ovl- denco satisfactory to tho Houso of which ho thus becomes a member, that ho possesses tho requisite constitutional and legal qualifications. II refused ad mission as a member for want of due allcglanco to tho Government, and re turned to his constituents, thoy nro nil mouUhed that none but parsons loyal to tho United States will be allowed a oiceln tho LcgUlaUvo Councils of the nation, anil tho political power and moral Influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted In tho Interests of loyalty to his Government and fidelity to the Union. Upon this question, so vitally r.ffeotlng tho restoration of the Union and the permanency of our present form of government, my con victions, heretofore expressed, have undergone no change; but, on the con trary, their correctness luw been con firmed by rellcctlon nnd time. If tho admission of loyal members to seata In thoirespectivo Houses of Congress was wise and expedient a year, ago, It Is no less wlsn nnd exnedielit nou!S If this anomalous condltlou'ls"right,now If, In tho exact condition of thcseStntes at tho present time, Itl Is lawful to exclude them from representation, I do not seo that the question wlllTbc changed bydho ellluoc of time. Ten years hence, If 4 these Stntcs remain as theyVaro, tho right of ropreseiitat'ion will bonostrong- cr-ithe right of exclusion will bo no weaker. ' HIT 

HITS ni" fsUCJ.r AllMISSIO.V. Tho Constitution of tho United States makes it thejduty or the President to recommend to tho consideration of Con gress "such m'easurosjis he shall Judge necessary or expedient." I know of no measure more" imperatively demanded byo"ory consideration of national in teresj? sound policy, and equal Justice, than the admission of loyal members from the now unrepresented Slates. This would consummate tho work of restora tion, and exert a most salutary lutlucucc In the re-establishment of peace, har mony, nnd fraternal feeling. It would tend greatly to renew the confidence of the American peoplo in tho vigor and stability of their Institutions. It would bind us more closely together as a na tion, and cnablo us to show to the world tho Inherent and recuperative powcrof a government founded upon tho will of tho people, anil established upon tho principals of liberty, justice, and Intelligence. Our increased strength and enhanced prosperity would irre- fragably demonstrate tho filllaey of the arguments against free institu tions drawn from our recent nation al disorders by tiio enemies of re publican government. Tho admission now excluded from Congre.-s, by allay ing doubt and apprehension, would turn capital, now awaiting an opportunity for investment, into tho channels of trade and industry. It would alleviate the present troubled condition of thoe States, and, by inducing emigration, lid In the settlement of fertile regions iv uncultivated, and lead to an in creased production of those staples which havo added so greatly to the wealth of the nation nnd the commerce of tho world. New fields of enterprise would bo opened to our progressive peo ple, nnd soon tho devastations of war would be repaired, and all traces of our domestic (inferences effaced from the minds of our countrymen. 

CONSOLIDATION' TO 111". AVOIDED. In our efi'orts'to prcservo " the unity of Government" which constitutes us one people," by restoring the States to the condition which they held prior to the Rebellion, we should bo cautious, lest, having rescued our nation from perils of threatened disintegration, wo resort to consolidation, nnd in the end absolute despotism, as a remedy for the recur. rence of similar troubles. The war hav ing terminated, and with it all occasion for tho exercise of powers of doubtful constitutionality, we should hasten to bring legislation within tho boundaries prescribed by the Constitution, and to return to tho ancient landmarks estab lished by our fathers for tho guidance of succeeding generations. "The Con stitutioiv which at any time exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic. act of the whole people, is sacredly ob ligatory upon all." " If, in the opinion of iho people, the distribution or modi flcation of tho constitutional powers be, in any particular, wrong, let it be cor rected by nn amendment in the way in which the Constitution designates. Rut lettherobenochango by usurpation ; for it is the customary weapon by which free governments nro destroyed." Wash ington spoko these words to his coun trymen when, followed by their love and gratitude, ho voluntarily retlied from the cares of public life. " To keep in all things within tho palo of our con stitutional powers, and cherish the Fed eral Union as tho only rock of safety," wero prescribed by Jefferson as rules of action to endear to his " countrymen the truo principles of their Constitution them illustrious, and who, long since withdrawn from tho scenes of life, havo left to their country tho rich legacy of their example, their wisdom, nnd their patriotism. Drawing fresh Inspiration frum their lemons, let us emulate them 1 iHHHH in love of country and respect for the Constitution nnd tho laws. omi I'lNANCrcs. Tho report of tho Secretary of the Treasury affords much Information re specting tho revenue and commerco of tho country. His views upon tho cur rency, and with reference to a proper adjustment of our revenue fystem, internal as well as Impost, nro com mended to tho careful consideration of Congress. In my last Annual Mcs Ntgo I expressed my general views upon these subjects. I need now only call at tention to tho necessity of carrying Into every Department of tho Government a system of rigid accountability, thorough retrenchment, and wise economy. With no exceptional norunusual expenditures, tho. oppressive burdens of taxation can bo lessened by such a modification of our revenue laws as Will bo consistent with tho public faith, and thu legitimate and necessary wants of the Government. The report presents a much more sat isfactory condition of our finances than one year ago tho most sanguine could havo anticipated. During the fiscal year ending tho thirtieth of June, 1S(W, the last year of the war, the public debt was increased $011,1)02,5:17, and on the thirty-first of October, 1S05, it amounted to S2,710,S.I,7C0. On tho thirty-first day of October, 1800, It had been re duced to $2,o5l,!)10,000, tho diminution during a period of fourteen months, commencing September first, 1805, and ending October thirty-first, 1800, having been S2n(!,!J7!),5G5. In the last annual report on the state of the finances, It was estimated that during tho three quarters of tho fiscal year ending tho thirtieth of Juno last, the debt would l)e increased $112,t!il,!)l7. During that period, however, It was reduced &lt,l!)0, !N7, the receipts of the year having been !?1)ti,!M)3,!Mi5 inure, and the expenditures J20il,ri2l),2:. less than tho estimates .Nothing could more clearly indicate than these statements thu extent and availability of tho national resources, mil the rapidity and safety with which, under our form of government, great military and naval establishments can lio disbanded, and expenses reduced from a war to a peace footing. During tho fiscal year ending tliothi tieth of June, 1800, the receipts were S0.i8.032.020. and tho oxiienditures !?320.- (i,i)IO, leaving an available surplus of 17,291, 080. It is estimated that tiio re ceipts for the fi-cal year ending the thir tieth June, 1807, will bo$17",001,!!S0,nnd that tho expenditures will reach the sum of $.'110,128,078, leaving intheTreas ury a surplus of loS,i;:l:l1:S0S. For the fiscal year ending Juno thirtieth, 1S0S, it is estimated that tho receip'ts will amount to $1:10,000,000, and that tho ex penditures will be $:!")0,217,0 It showing an excess of $S.-,722,:V!) in favor of the Government. These estimated receipts may bo dlmiuNIied by a reduction of excise and import duties ; but after all necessary reductions shall havo been made, the revenue of the present and of following years will doubtless be suf ficient to cover ail legitimate charge: upon the Treasury, and leavo a largo annual surplus to bo applied to the pay ment of tho principal of tho debt. There seems now to bo no good reason why taxes may not lie reduced as the country advances In population and wealth, and yet tliedebt lie extinguished within the next quarter of a century oun 

AK.MV. The report of the Secretary of War furnishes valuable and Important infor mation in reference to the operations of ids Department during the past year Few volunteers n6w remain in theser vice, and they are being discharged as rapidly as they can bo replaced by regu lar troops. Thu army lias been prompt ly paid, carefully provided with modi cal treatment, well sheltered and sub sisted, and Is to bo furnished with breech loading small -arms. Tho military strength of the nation has been unim paired by tho discharge of volunteers, tho disposition of unserviceable or per ishable stores, and tho retrenchment of expenditure. Sulllcient war material to meet any emergency has been re tained, and, from the disbanded volun teers stauding ready to respond to the national call, largo armies can be rapidly organized, equipped, and concentrated. Fortifications on the coast and frontier have received, or are being prepared for nioro powerful armaments; lake sur veys and harbor and river improve ments are in course of energetic prose- cutIon. Preparations havo been made the payment oi tuetuuiitional Doiui- s authorized during too recent ses- lon of Congress, under such regulations will protect the Government from and, and secure to tho honorably-dls- irged soldier the well-earned reward his faithfulness and gallantry. More in six thousand maimed soldiers havo reived artificial limbs or other stirgi- apparatus; and forty-ouo national metcrios, containing the remains of 10 liuuureu aim lour tiiousauu live indred and twenty-six Union soldier.- ivo already neeii csinniMiou. Tno al estimate of military appropriations $2r120.i,000. nut NAVY. It Is stated In tho report of tho Secro ry of the Navy that tho naval forco tills time consists of 278 vessels, armed ith-,T'l guns. Of these ll't vessels. irrvlng 1,020 guns, nro in commission, distributed chiefly among seven squad rons. Tho number of men in tho ser vlco is 10,000. Great activity anil vlgl lanco havo been displayed by all tho squadrons, and their movements havo bcenjudlciotisly and ellklently arranged In such manner iw would-best promoto .vmorienn commerce, nnd nrotcct thn rights and Interests of our countrymen nbroad. Tho vessels unemployed aro undergoing repairs, or aro laid" up un til their services may bo required. Most of tho iron-clad fleet Is at League Island In the vicinity of Philadelphia, a place which, until decisive action should bo taken by Congress, was selected by tho Secretary of the Navy as the most cllg iblo location for that class of vessels. It Is important that asultablopubllcslatlon should bo provided for tho Iron-clad fleet. It Is intended that these vessels shall bo In proper condition forany emergency, nnd it Is desirable that the bill accep't lng League Island for nnval purposes, wmcii passed tho House of Representa tives nt its last session, should receive final action at an early period, In order that thero may be a suitable public station for this class of vessels, as well as a navy-yard of area sulllcient for the wants of the service, on tho Dolnwaro River. The Naval Pension fuiidaniounts to $11,7.30,000, having been Increased S!2.7o().(H)l) llm-ftur f lio vmip. Tim nvrmn. dlturcs or tho Department for tho fiscal year ending thirtieth Juno last were $1:1,321,520, and tho estimates for the coming yearaniount to $2:3,508,130. At tention Is Invited to tho condition of our seamen, and tho importance of legis lative measures for their relief and Im provement. The suggestions in behalf of tills deserving class of our fellow-citizens aro earnestly recommended to tho favorable attention of Congress. l'OST-OlTICE. The report of the Postmaster-General presents a most satisfactory condition of tiie postal service, and submits recom mendations which deserve theconsider- ntlon or Congress. Tho revenues of tho Department for the year cndlnir June thirtieth, 1S0O, wero $M,:)S0,nS0, and the expenditures $15,352,07!), show ing nn excess of the latter of $005,000. In anticipation of tho deficiency, how ever, a special appropriation was mado by Congress in tho act approved July twenty-eighth, 1800. Including tho standlngnpproprlution of $700,000 forfroo mall matter, as a legitimate portion of the revenues yet remaining unexpend ed, the actual deficiency for the past year is only $205,000 a sum within $51,111 of the amount estimated in the annual report of ISO I. The decrease of revenue, compared with the previous year, was ono and ono fifth per cent., and the increase of expenditure.', ow ing principally to tho enlargement or tho mail service in the South, was twelve per cent. On tho thirtieth of of Juno last thero wero in operation six thousand nine hundred and thirty mail routes, witli an aggregate length of ono hundred and eighty thousand nine hundred and twenty-one miles, and ag gregateannual transportation of seventy one million eight hundred and thirty seven thousand nine hundred and four teen miles, and an aggregate annual co-t, including all expenditures, of $8, 110,181. The length or railroad routes is thirty two thousand and ninety-two miles, and the annual transportation thirty million six hundred and nine thousand four hundred and sixty-seven miles. Tiie length of steamboat routes is fourteen thousand three hundred and forty-six miles, und the annual transportation three million four hundred and eleven thousand nine hundred and sixty-two miles. The mail service is rapidly in creasing throughout tho whole country, and Its steady extension In IheSouthern States indicates their constantly im proving condition. Tho growing im portance of the foreign service also merits attention. The Post-Oilico De partment of Great Rritniu and our own have agreed upon a preliminary basis for a new postal convention, which it is believed will provoeniinently beneficial to the commercial interests or tho Unit ed States, inasmuch as it contemplates a eduction or tho international letter pos tage to one half the existing rates ; a re duction of postage with all other coun tries to nnd from which correspondence is transmitted lu the llrltish mail, or In closed malls through the United King dom ; the establishment of uniform and reasonable charges for the sea and terri torial transit or correspondence in clos ed mails; and an allowaueo to each Post-Office Department or tho right to uso all mall communications establish ed under the authority or the other for tho dispatch or correspondence, either in open or closed malls, on tho same terms ns those applicable to thu Inhabit ants or tlio country providing tho means of transmission. rt'llMC LANDS INDIAN A1TA111S. The report of tho Secretary or tho In terior exhibits the condition of those branches of the public service which nro committed to hlssiipervlslon. Dur ing tlio last fiscal year 1,020,012 acres of public land wero disposed of, l,8!)2,ol0 acres of which wero entered under tho homestead act. Tho policy originally adopted relative to tho public lands has undcrgono essential modification. Im mediate revenue, and not their rapid settlement, was tlio cardinal feature of our land system. Long experience and oarne.-;t discussion havo resulted In tho conviction that tlio early development of our agricultural resources, and the diffusion of uu energetic population over our vast territory, aro objects of far greater importance to tlio national growth and prosperity than tlio proceeds of tiie salo of the laud to tho highest bidder in open market. Tho pre-emption laws confer ujjon tho pioneer who compiles with the terms thoy Impose, tho prlvllego of purchasing a limited portion of " unolfercd laud" at thu min imum price. Tho homestead enactments rellovo tho settlor from tho pnymont of purchase monoy, nnd socuro hi in a per manent home, upon the condition of res idence for a term of years. This liberal policy Invites emigration from tho Old, nnd the more crowded portion of tho ev World. Its propitious results nro undoubted, nnd will bo more signally manifested when time shall havo glvon to It a wider development, llAIt.UOAD flllANTS. Congress has mado liberal grants of public lands to corporations, In aid of tho construction of railroads and other In ternal Improvements. Should this pol- j icy hereafter provall, more stringent I provisions will bo required to secure a faithful application of the fund. Tho title to the lauds should not pass, by pat ent or otherwise, but remain In tho Gov ernment and subject to Its control until some portionorthoroad has been actually built. Portions or them might, then, from time to time, be conveyed to the corporation, but never lu greater ratio to the whole quantity embraced by the grant than tho completed parts bear to tho entlru length of the projected im provement. This restriction would not operate to the prejudice of any under taking conceived In good faith and exe cuted w'lth reasonable energy, as It Is tho settled praeticcto withdraw from market the lands falling within tho operation of such grants, and thus to exclude tiie in ception of a subsequent ad verse right. A breach or tho conditions which Congress may deem properto Impose should work n forfeiture of claim to the lauds so with drawn but unconveyed, and of title to tho lands conveyed which remain un sold. Operations on tho several lines of the Pacific Railroad havo been prosecuted with unexampled vigor nnd success. Should no unforseen causes of delay occur, It Is confidently anticipated that this great thoroughfare will bocompletd before tho expiration of the period des ignated by Congress. PENSIONS. During (lie last fiscal year the amount paid to pensioners, including tho ex pensesor disbursement, was$i:),150,00(i and 50,17? names wero added to tho pen sion rolls. Tlio entire number or pen sioners, Juno thirtieth, 1800, was 120,722. This fact furnishes melancholy nnd strik ing proof of tho sacrifices mado to vin dicate the constitutional authority of tlio Federal Government, and to main tain inviolate the Integrity or tlio Union, They Impose upon us corresponding ob ligations. It Is estimated that thirty threo million dollars will bo required to meet the exigencies of this branch of the service during tlio next fiscal year. Tit EAT IKS WITH THE INDIANS. Treaties havo boon concluded with tlu Indians, who, enticed into armed opposition to our Government at tho outbreak or the Rebellion, havo uncon ditionally submitted to our authority, and manifested an earnest desire for a renewal of friendly relations. THE PATENT OITIUE. During tho year ending September thirtieth, 1800, eight thousand seven hundred and sixteen patents for useful Inventions and designs wero issued, and at that date tho balance in thu Treasury to the credit of tho patent fund was two hundred and twenty-eight thousand two hundred and ninety-seven dollars. THE .MISSISSIPPI I.EVEES. As a subject upon which depends an immense amount of production and commerce of the country, I recommend to Congress such legislation as may bu necessary for tlio preservation or tlio levees or tlio Mississippi River. It is a matterof national importance that early steps should be laken not only to add to the efficiency of the barriers against de structive inundations, but for tho re moval or all obstructions to the free and safu navigation of that great channel of trade and commerce. DlSTltlOT flK COr.U.MlUA. Tho District of Columbia, under ex isting laws, is not entitled to that rep resentation in tlio National Councils which, from our earliest history, has been uniformly accorded to each Terri tory established from time to time with in our limits. It maintains peculiar re lations to Congress, to whom tho Con stitution has granted tlio power of exor cising oxclusivo legislation over tho seat of Government. Our fellow-citizens re siding in tho District, whoso interests are thus confided to tlio special guar dianship of Congress, exceed In number the population of several of our Terri tories, and nojiist reason Is perceived why a delegate to their ciioicu should not bu admitted to a seat in tho House or Representatives, No mode seems so appropriate and effectual of enabling them to mnko known their peculiar condition and wants, and of securing tho local legislation adapted to them I therefore recommend thu pasago of a law authorizing tlio electors or the Dis trict of Columbia to chnoso a delegate, to be allowed the samo rights and priv ileges ns a delegate representing a Ter ritory. Tho Increasing enterprise nnd rapid progress and Improvement in the District aro highly gratifying, and I tru.-t that tho efforts of tho municipal authorities to promote tlio prosperity of tho National Metropolis will receive tho efficient and generous co-operation of Congress. AUIiH'U.TUItK. Tlio report of tlio Commissioner of Agriculture reviews the. operations of his Department during the past ycur, anil asks thu aid of Cougnvs in Its efforts to encourage thoso status which, swurg cd by war, nr now earnestly ongnged in thu reorganization of domestic In dustry. oun roiiKioN affairs. It is n subject of congratulation that no foreign combinations against our do mestic peace and safety, or our legiti mate Influence among the nations, havo been formed or attempted. While sen timents of reconciliation, loyalty, and patriotism havo Increased nt homo, a more Just consideration of our national character und rights has been innulfcstcd by foreign nations. THE ATLANTIC TIIIEOKAPH. Tho entire success or tho Atlantic Tel egraph between tho coasts or Ireland and tho Province of Newfoundland is an achievement which has boon Justly celebrated lu both hemispheres ns tho opening of nn era in tho progress of civ ilization. Thero is reason to expect that equal success will nttend, and even great er results follow, the enterprise for con necting the two continents through tho Pacific Ocean by tho projected line of tclegruph between Kamschatka und tho Russian Possessions in America. EMI'JIIATION OK KOKEIGN CONVICTS. Tho resolution of Congress protesting against pardons by foreign Govern ments or persons convicted of infamuu.4 oirences, on condition of emigration to our country, hits been communicated to the States with which wo maintain in tercourse, and thu practice, so justly tho subject or complalui M our part, has not been renewed. RUSSIA. Tho congratulations of Congress to tho Emperor of Russia, upon his escape from attempted assassination, havo been presented to that humane and enlight ened rulers, and received by him with expressions of grateful appreciation.

Thu Executive, warned of nn nttompt by Spam 'l-American adventurers to in duce the emigration of frccdmcn of tho United States to a foreign country, pro- tested against thu project ns one which, if consummated, would reduco them to a bondage even more oppress! vo than that from which they have just been re lieved. Assurance has been received rrom tho government or tho State In which tho plan was matured, that tho proceeding will meet neither its encour agement nor approval. It is a questlou worthy of your consideration, whether our laws upon thl'j subject are ndequato to tho prevention or punishment of tho crime thus meditated. l'UANCE IN MEXICO DELAY IN Till! DEPARTURE OP THE FIIENCU TllOOPS. In tho mouth of April last, as Con gress Is aware, a friendly arrangement was mado between tho Emperor of France and tho President of the United States for tho withdrawal from Mexico of tho French expeditionary forces. This withdrawn! was to bo effect ed in three detachments, the first or which, it was understood, would leavo Moxico in November, now past, tho second in March next, nnd tho third nnd last in November, 1807. Immediately upon the completion or tho evacuation, the French Government was to assmno the same attitude or non-intervention, u regard to Mexico, as is held by tho Government or tho United States. Re peated assurances have been given by tho Emporor, since that agreement, that bu would complete the promised evacu ation within tlio period mentioned, or ooner. It was reasonably oxpected that tho proceedings thus contemplated would produce a crisis or great political interest n tho Republic of Mexico. Tho newly- appointed minister of the United States, Mr. Campbell, was thereforo ent for wards tho ninth day of November last) to assume bis proper functions as Minis ter Plenipotentiary of tho United States to that Republic. It was also thought expedient that ho should be attended in tho vicinity of Mexico by tho Lieulcn- tiut-Gcncral of tho Army of tho United States, with the view of obtaining such information as might be important to determine tho courso to be pursued by the United States in re-establishing and maintaining necessary and proper in tercourse with the Republic or Mexico. Deeply interested in tlio cause or liberty and humanity, it seemed nn obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever intlucnco wo possessed for the restora tion and permanent establishment in that country ol a domestic nnd republi can form or government. Such was tho condition ofnffalrsin re gard to Mox leo , wh en , on t ho t wen f y-sec-mill of November last, olllcial informa tion was received from Paris that tho Emperor of Franco had some tlmo before decided not to withdrawn detitchmentof his forces in the month of November past according to engagement, but that this decision was mado with tho purposo of withdrawing tho whole of thoso forces In tho ensuing Spring. Of this dotenni natloir, however, tho United States had not received any notice or intimation ; and, so soon as tho Information was re ceived by tlio Government, caro was taken to mako known its dissent to the Emperor of France. I cannot forego the hope that Franco will reconsider tho subject, and adopt some resolution In regard to tho evacu ation of Moxico which will conforin'as nearly as practicable with tlio existing engagement, and thus meet the just ex pectations of the United States. Tho papers relating to the subject will ba laid before you. It Is believed that, with tho evacuation of Mexico by tho expeditionary force?, no subject for seri ous differences between Franco and tho ! Unit oil States would remain. Thecv
