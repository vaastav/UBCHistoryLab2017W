Had the condittons been changed and the national convention of the republicans asembled in Albany. It Is soarcely to be doubted that Mr. Seward would have been nominates; It is quite cer (ah that LIncoln would not have been nominated."

Iat spring Mr. Carlisle de ciared that so more revenue is needed be repeated aLt asesertion several times during the sumasr. ITis state meat was dhallenged by several widely kmown demoora In tdie sente and the house.

By one process or another, the admtn Wratmi 4o bound to keep up its pre tegass about fie reveme.-lt is deter mined not to utam good ie dhaegee and the pedkldons made last year by snaior Gorman and others after the giwfldent had refused to sign the tariff bl. Probably some of the Standard's seaders will recall Mr. Gormma's mem easble samte speech. He made It late to J'tiy of last year. It was a speech ImputWnan Presdent Cleveland's bon on Pt opeed the door to party caucus es, it revealed many polit/oal secrets. It assailed the president. It defended the senmte tariff bil and its prepara tion, opentiy charging that the president sad Mr. Osrlsle were aware of the'con oessions that btd been made to Insure the passage of the bill. that they had been constantly consulted, and tha the president had distinctly sanctioned all that had been done. Mr. Gormean told how he had dared. "when otshees tal teted, to walk with Cleveland through the filth and stdme of the campaign of 1884" and how he and his colleagues tbedfought for:tariff reform when "oow ards in high places had not dared to show 'their heads." It will be remembered that, as a sort of finish to the tariff debate, the presi dent wrote a letter with unoompamenrt wry reference to several demoauats. In dealing with this letter Mr. Gorman maid: "There Is no power, no matter how great. h this country, not even the president with his patronage, that would keep me silent under the charges. I say that ihe president's con duct 4s infamous. No man can =a terially change this bin without de testing it. Who will take the respon saibity? I can Imagne no man will do t unless ha is consumed with vaisty end desires to set his judgmnt above that of this ftlowsw or ebas to keep the ess ueAdoer the people In order that he may side into power rather than give comabet and peace and prosperity to Uis terow countryaea."

AlI that io happening now- he delayed treasury report itself -is a pretty clear fdleoetio that the statements made by Senator Gorman and other demorats respecting the real condition of the treasury are true. Now comes Henri J. Haskell. attorney general. etc.. and he esays that the cap itol coammession includes two gentlemen who are not lawful members of that bard-to-wit. Charles F. Lloyd and W. K. Flowerres. Mr. LJoyd is :n the state miltia. Mr. Flowerree is a state sen ator, and the attorney teneral holds that, under the law, they are barred. as the conetitution forbids the appoint anent to a civil office of a person hold tng another state office.
