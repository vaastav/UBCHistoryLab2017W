Our list of city subscribers is large but by no means as large as it ought to be. A newspaper is one of the chief necessities of every town, but a newspaper cannot prosper unless it is encouraged and liberally patronized by the people. The Fisherman & Farmer has been published ovci eight years. It has managed to liye fairly well, but it has not receiv ed the encouragment and pat ronage it has deserved. We have had much to discour age us, many difficulties with which to contend, and a long and patient struggle, but with hard work we have manatred to sur- vive while others have failed. We have faithfully advocated Democratic principles, have la bored earnestly for the upbuild ing of the town and with earnest endeavors have done all in our power for the promotion of every interest of the city and its people. Now. friends, we ask you to give us your hearty co-operation and support. With it we pledge ourselves to make the Fisiikr max & Farmer a more credita blc representative of our town. If you are not a subscriber then you should at once have your name placed upon the list; if not an advertiser you should feel it a duty to patronize us in this way thereby helping yourself as well as natronizintr one of the enterprises of your town. We need money with which to carrv on biu iness. and we ned your support. Shall we have it, or snail we not? lulenton must have factories if it wishes to prosper. Factor ieswill briu"-wealth to both the town and surrounding country. Why not some of our monied men make a start in that direc tion ? There are many small industries that would flourish here. Too long have the advantages of Kdenton been ignored. Too long have we boasted of our ad vantages and then waited for out siders to develop our resources 11ns should not be so. We should be willing to make good our protestations by our deeds. Now let s make a start. Home capital should at once organize and establish some industrial en- . " ATM -lit' 1 o c- - and inviting, others will come, and soon the city will grow rap idly in population, in commerce, in industrial enterprises and in manufacturing importance. We must go forward with greater strides. lernr sc. 1 e nem nemo- arrf Congress convened 011 Monday last. The Presidents Message is a very lengthy document and covers a great variety of subjects.

BROWN'S IRON BITTERS Harry Skinner's majority over Branch is 2,964, he having re. ceived 16,510 votes and Branch 13,546 so declared by the State Board of Canvassers. The nominees for Chief Justice led their respective tickets. The vote for Shepherd is 127,593 and for Faircloth 148,434, making the latter's majority 20,841. The total vote cast is 276,027. Two years ago the total vote was 280,500. The falling off in the vote was not so great as was thought. Justice Shepherd came in 8,000 votes ol getting as many votes as did tov. uarr. ine Republicans and Populists two years ago polled 143,524 votes. They thus gained this year 5,000. Thus two years ago 2,457 votes were cast for the Prohibition candidate for Governor, while this year the Prhibitionists had no candidate. Walter Clarke got 272,970 votes, or 4,000 less than the total cast. In Wayne county, the home of Marion Butler, Democrats are being boycotted. The princi pals of Mt. Olive and Pikeville schools havinir voted the Demo- 1 cratic ticket, their Populist pat rons have withdrawn their child ren and say that Democrats must look to Democrats for their sup port. They are even withdraw ing the amounts pledged to Uieir pastors thus carrying the feeling into the churches. SUGGESTING REFORMS. Wilmington St3r. The Raleigh News and Obser ver of Thursday last contained a paper by Judge Clark, of the Su preme Court, suggesting laws that ought to be enacted by the Legislature of North Carolina and by Congress. There are nine of these suggestions. The first favors the passage of a law by the Legislature limit ing the rate of interest for the use of money to six per cent. The second favors the prohi bition of railroad passes or tele graphs francs to State officers or members of the Legislature, as is provided for in the new constitu tion recently adopted by the State of New York. The third favors the adoption ofa constitutional amendment providing for the election of U. S. Senators by the people. The fourth favors the owner ship by the Government of the telegraphs and telephones with a itics from the party in power view to making them a part of 1 and thusth solidity of the 111a the postal service, and the con- j chine would be broken, ueetiou of the postoffices of the 1 There is much to be said in country by telephones. j favor of the election of post The fifth favors the election of postmasters by the people The sixth favors a change in the election laws of this State and recommends the establish ment of at least three polling places in each township, to save time, thus securing a fuller vote, at less expense, and quicker re turns, thus tending to prevent fraud and contributing to a better expression of the will of the peo ple. The seventh recommends some changes in the criminal law to expedite trials of criminals and to insure justice. He contends that under the laws as framed now the guilty man has too many chances for escape and thus so frequently escapes, the result be ing resort to lynch law by the people, who have lost confidence in the courts and have become weary of the law's delay and fail ure. The eighth suggests that the Judges of the Courts be given supervisory power over the length of speeches by counsel, thus saving time and much 'ex pense to attendants upon the courts and to the State, as was formerly the case in this State and is now in every other State 111 the civilized world, he says, except Iowa, where when coun sel begin to address the jury the judges go out and play billiards. The ninth suggests a code com mission, not simply to codify the laws of the State but also the opinions of the courts, which are quoted as law, thus simplifying the law and condensing it into a few handy volumes. He gives reasons for all of these suggestions, which will command attention, the last three especially on account, if nothing else.ot the judicial position which he holds, and his opportunities for ascertaining and studying the defects of our judicial system. In advocating the election of post-masters and of United States Senators he symply gives expres- siontoa sentiment which has be;n growing and eainiup-l strength in this country for some I years. It has grown so strong j as to have been indirect;, adopt- j ed in some iustances both as to ! Senators and postmasters. In the j State of Illinois, and we think one or two other Western States, the people in their conventions express their choice for Senators and the members elected to the legislature are thus instructed and feel bound to vote in accord ance with the will of the people whom thej' represent as thus expressed. It is only a question of time, if there should be no constitutional amendment' providing for an election by the people, when the Illinoise method will be gener ally adopted, which will be prac tically an election by the people, for it amounts to an instruction to the members of the Legisla ture. It has made so much progress in the case ot postmasters that in many instances appointments have been made on the strength of the greatest number of names presented by applicants, other things being equal, and in some instances it has been decided to let the contest be settled by elec tion. The petitions which applicants get up and carry to Washington with them are nothing more or less than a form of election, the citizen simply signing his name instead of casting his ballot, the difference being that the petition with the most names on it might be pigeon-holed if it didn't suit the Senator or Senators who manage these things, while if election were the method the candidate having the largest number of votes would go in, and couldn't be froze out by a Sena tor who couldn't control him or didn't have any use for him. Those who look to civil service to reform the governmental ma chinery would find this one of the very longest strides in that direction, for it would at once take out of the hands of the ad ministration that comes into power the appointment of 70,000 postmasters and the dismissal of that many more regardless of the fitness of the appointees or of the incumbents removed. There would also be 70,000 men less running to or sending peti tions or advocates to Washington, and that much very expensive and wearying and vexatious work taken off the hands of the President, the Postmaster Gen eral and his assistants, and that much time saved for them to de vote to the duties of their offices which ordinarily require all the time they can find. Then the service would not be as partisan as it is under the system of ap pointment, and could not be made a part of the political ma chine as it has been and will be while the postmasters hold their places as a gift of the party manipulators. They practically control all the postmasters ap pointed which means that the party in power controls 70,000 postoffices. But under the elec tive system many districts might have postmasters of different pol- j masters by the people and also of the election of U. S. Senators.
