' Secretary Fish telecrranhed Wash- burne on September 7th: The re quest of Favre that the United States join the other Powers in their efforts ter peace has been reoeived. It is not the policy or to the interest of the United States to act jointly with tne European .rowers on European questions. I have instructed Ban croft to ascertain whether Germany J ? at . a a . a . aesires tne goca cmcea or tne united States, but not to tender them without assurance of acceptance. Secretary Fish in a subseauent dis patch compliments Mr. Washburne for prudent and discreet conduct. Minister Motley wrote Mr. Fish, August 11th. that the French Gov ernment telegraphed to London yes terday to tnow it Ueneral .Lee is here, or waa expected. The supposi tion iB that a military command waa to ba offered him, showing a want of confidence ia the government of their armies. Secretary 1 ish. on the 0;h of SeD- tcmber, telegraphed to Minister Ban croft that Minister Washburne tele graphs that France requests the Uni ted states to join other powers in an effort for peace. It has been tbe uni form polioy and is to the true inter ests of the United btates not to join European powers in any interference in European questions; yet the Pres ident strongly desires to see the war arrested and the blessings of peace restored. If Germany also desires to have the good offices of the United States interposed, the President will be glad to contribute all aid in his power to secure tne restoration of ,eiLC0 between the two great powers now at war, and witn whom the Uni ted States has so many traditions of friendship. Asoertaia if North Ger many desires such ofhaes, but without making tenders thereof, unless as sured they will be accepted. On September lltb, Bancroft tele graphed to Secretary Fish: "It is no time now for America to interfere. Germany rejects all foreign interfer ence, and every other power holds back. The United States would Stand alone, and be unable to accom plish anything. Our interest and dignity require us. for the pres ent, to stand aloof." Un tne 6J:h ot September, the Sec retary of State wrote to Bancroft, as follows: "The reasons which you pre sent against American intervention, between France and Prussia, are sub stantially among the considerations which were determined upon by tbe President ia the course and policy in dicated to you in the eable dispatches from - this office, en 1 the 9:b, and in rejecting all idea- of mediation, unless upon a joint request of both warring pow ers. It continues to be the hope of the President, as it is the interest of the people of ;this country, that ! the unhappy war in which France and North Germany are engaged, should find an early end. This Gov ernment will not trespass oa any opin ion as to the terms or conditions on which peace may or should be es tablished between the two Govern ments equally sharing its friendship, but will hold that tbe prolongation of the war will not find its cause either in tne extreme de mands on one eide, or the ex treme sensitiveness on the other. so iar as you can consistently, and without my official interposition, ad vise or counsel. It is hoped you will not lose any proper opportunity to indicate the wishes and hopes of the President and American people, as above represented, and to contribute what you may to tbe presentation of such terms of peace as may be fit to the greatness and power whioh North Germany has manifested, and as shall not be humiliating or derogatory to the pride of the great people who were our earliest and fast allies. Oa the 28 ,h of October, Fish wrote Bancroft the following: Sir:- I have acknowledge! tho re ceipt of your" dispatch of - the 5-.h inst., iu whicb, referring to my letter of the 221 of July last, to Barou Gerolt, you Btate that Mr. Delbruck informs you that when the time shall come for negotiating peace with France, one condition to be proposed and insisted on will be the recognition of the prinoiple exempting private property on the high seas from seiz ure. xuu lu'iiuio wuecner you will be authorized to propose on vonr nart recognition in the-pending treaty, re lating to Consulships and inherit ances between the United States and the German Union. In aeply, you are informed that you are authorized to obtain tbe recognition of the prin aipal for the exemption of private property of citizens, subjecta of either of the two parties, from capture on the high seas by either privateers or publio vessels of the other. . On the 11th of November, the Sec retary sent the following to Mr. Ban croft: . ; .. "Sib: The refusal of the German authorities at tbe investment of Paris to allow the United States Minister there to send a messenger o London with a pouoh with dispatches from his legation, unless the contents sl the pouoh should be unsealed, mast be regarded as an erroneous proceeding, which can not be acquiesced in by the government. A blockade both by sea and land is a military measure for the reduction of an enemy's fortresses by preventing the ao cess of relief from without, and by compelling troops and inhabitants to surrender for want of supplies; when, however, a blockaded fortress happens to be the capital of a country where diplomatic representative of neutral States resides, has a blockading fores the right to cut him eff from all intercourse by letter from the outer world, and eva with his own govern ment no such fight is either expressly recognized by publio law or even al luded to in any treatise on the subjsct. The right of the legation, however, is fully acknowledjed, and as evidently the right and privilege cf-receiving and sending messages. This: privilege was acknowledged in un qualified terms, ' There is no excep tion or reservation looking ta th possibility cr a biocxade ct tbe Can ital by a hostile force. Although such blockades are not oi lrequcnt occur renoc. tneir iiaointy to happen must have prefKcted iteit to the minds of the wrilcrs on public' law, and if they had supposed that the right of sending messengers merged in, or subordinate to tbe bcl- lgrrent rights ot the assailant thiv certainly would have said so. Indeed, the rights of the Legation under suoh circumstances , must be consid ered paramount, to any belligerent right. JLheyoogct nofr to questioned or curtailed unl;s3 the attacking party has a good reason to believe that they will be abused, or, unless some military necessity, whicb, upon a proper statement, must be regarded as obvious, shall require the cur tailment. The condition upon wmcn tne sending or messengers was ottered was. cumulating and could not be accepted by any diplomatic government agent with any selt-respeot. 1 he correspon dence between those officers and their governments is always, more or less. confidential, and it is unreasonable to suppose that its Euppression by block ading force should be permitted. In deed the requirement of such a con dition must be regarded as tanta mount to imputation, both upon the integrity of the Minuter and the neu trality of his government. You will consequently remonstrate against the exeroise of authority adverted to, be- mg contrary to mar para mount right ot . legation which every independent nation- ought - to enjoy and in which all are equally interested. Russia has heretofore been leading tbe champion rights of neutrals on tne ocean, and she has. even during the existence of this war, made acknowledgements of her sacri fices to her faith and consistency in that respect. The crfurse of her arms on band does not seem to warrant or require any enforcement of extreme belligerent claims ia , that ouar ter as against neutrals. The anal- agous privileges of - the legation were, upon several occasions, success fully asserted bv thia Government Daring the late war betwen Brazil and her allies, on one side, and Paraguay on tne otber. Mr. Washburne, U. B. Minister to Paraguay, applied for a permit to take him through the hos tile lines to Ascension.

McMabon, his success or, to pass the' same lines. nd for the vessel wbich carried im bring back Mr. Washhnrnfl. This also, though first refused, was ultimately granted.

Many railroad trains, loaded with cattlo, Bheep and provisions, had been concentrated near Orleans for the succor of Paris. They were all saved. Most ot the guns taken by the Prussians were mounted naval guns. Tbe evacuation of Orleans was caused by the demoralization of some new Frsuob troops, and tha mistaken JUL I ' strategy and indecision of General D'Aurelles de Paladines, who al - lowed two corps to be overwhelmed by the whole Prussian army, although he had 200,000 men withia reach.

Having had an opportunity to look at the Emperor' forthcoming pamphlet on tbe relations between France and Oer ma ny, by Marquis lie Urlcaurt, chosen by tbe Kniperor an tbe supposed author, I aend you a few extracts under a chapter headed "ISott:" ( . . But tt was not only England and Rat sia's friendship, which, by aincere opee hearted action, tbe Emperor had gained In 13:, but It was altto tbe gratitude of l'rusBlB, through tbe readiness with wbich be compiled witu the wlsnea of her King. Tbe only belligerent powers Russia, Eu giand, i'ranca.Tarkey, and Piedmont bad been called to meet at Paris 1b Congress. Tbe King of Prussia leit hurt In tbe highest degree. He had not been invited toioln the conference wbich was to eecure tbe peace of Europe. England had op posed hut admission energetically. Klie was extremely nettled at tbe political course of the iierlln Cabinet, wbloh, dur ing the entire campaign, never concealed its sympathies f it Itumla. The brother tt tbe present King. Frederick William, wrote a letter to Emperor .Kapoleoo, In which he rtf! acted ou the deep grief ex- Eerleuced by him at this exclusion, which e viewed aa equal to an tnsmt, but con fided fully in their justice and lrlendshlp. Napoleou here requested him to remove England's opposition, and added tbat he would be happy and thank him for his ad mission to tne Congress, considering It aa a tei vice personally rendered, for which he would always be grateful. In Itdi, the l'rus?lau Ambassador al Paris, Count Von Der Uoldlwas, was commissioned to sound the intentions ot tbe Emperor, and sever- ! al conversations concerning this matter iHk nlace.

This neutrality waa so favorable that Prussia permitted her to commence tha campaign at lhat epoch.
