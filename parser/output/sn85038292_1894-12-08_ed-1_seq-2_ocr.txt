The Democratic Advocate. WESTMINSTER, MD. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1894. An Honest Assessment Law. i “A Baltimore Coun:y Tax-Payer,” in a communication to the Advocate writes on an | assessment law, taking for his text an article from the Port Tobacco Times. The Times alluded to the fact that two bills had been : passed and vetoed, and says that the people demand a fair, honest and moderate assess ment law. The Advocate’s correspondent does not regard either bill that has been passed as fair, honest or moderate, and says the only law that could be honest and fair is one that contains no exemptions. This has been the Advocate* s view. Under a law containing exemptions property is ex empted that the law never intended should be, and a law with no exemptions leaves no room for hair-splitting technicalities or doubt. Under our constitution all must pay accord ing to their actual worth in real and personal property. Under the administration of our laws, supposed not to be in violation of the organic law, fully half of the wealth ot the state is untaxed. And the courts have sus tained the tax laws whenever they have been attacked. The people of Maryland are quite unani mous upon one point—that a new assessment law is needed. Upon details of the law there are wide differences among them. One class, to which our correspondent and the Advocate belong, would tax everything—all property, real and personal, except state, county and municipal buildings. Another class would tax everything except church property, pri vate educational institutions and those that are regarded as charitable. Another would add mortgages to these exemptions, and another would exempt capital of all kinds, for fear of driving it from the state. And then there are the single taxers, that would tax nothing but land. With all this divergence of opinion, it will l>e difficult to frame a law that will be entirely satisfactory to the people, or one that can be passed by the Legislature and receive exe cutive sanction. The Hayes bill would not have been a compliance with the constitution, but it was a considerable improvement on the present law. Many people sustained the Gov ernor's veto, but the majority, probably, wanted the Hayes bill. This desire upon the part of many no doubt resulted from imper fect knowledge of the provisions of the bill. Assessment will be a leading issue next year, and the Legislature will attempt to pass a bill iu the winter of 18%. With all the dif ference of opinion, among all the people, of all classes and politics, it is likely that if a law is passed at all, it will be a compromise meas ure. and not in accordance with the constitu tion. The press of the state hold divergent views and all writers and speakers differ. The people all agree upon the necessity for a re valuation of property, but there the unanimity ceases. The people will also agree that if no new subjects of taxation are included in an assessment bill, there is no use in having a new assessment. If the "basis of taxation is not to be increased and the rate decreased, there is no use of going to the expense of re assessing property. President Cleveland’s Message. President Cleveland sent his annual message to Congress ou Monday last, promptly at its assembling. A brief summary appears else where in this issue, and all who would gain a knowledge of public affairs should carefully read it. The message is chiefly a business document, and presents concisely the details of govern ment and out relations with other nations. The recommendations by the President are not numerous, ami the moet important relate to finance and taxation. He still declares for free iron and coal and the abolition of the one eight of a cent differential duty on refined sugar. But the part of his communication dealing with iron, coal and sugar arc rather disappointing. The President has not urged these views with his accustomed vigor and force, but rather re-states them in a perfunc tory way. There is no insistence upon the passage of the bills bearing upon these mat ters, ns essential to the full measure of tariff' revision, or as a duty the dominant party owes under its promise to the country, or as neces sary to the manufacturing interest in one case and to the millions of consumers in the other. It is true the President has before written vig orously and strongly on these matters, and may have considered a mere reiteration of his views as sufficient, but that part of his message in reference to them is somewhat disappoint ing to those who have so steadfastly stood by him and followed wherever he has led. On the question of finance the President states plainly the necessity for legislation to protect the treasury from being depleted of its gold reserve, and asserts that if it is not granted he will avail himself ofthe act of 1875 to do it. He also favors a change in the hank ing laws, and endorses the recommendations of Secretary Carlisle, which virtually compre hend the scheme of banking, known ns the Baltimore plan, and which was endorsed by the national bankers’ association at its recent session in Baltimore. Electricity vs. Steam. Competition is the life of trade, and a good illustration of it is soon to be inaugurated in the Cumberland Valley, Pa. Because of the competition created by the Cumberland Valley Traction Company, the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company have decided to run fifteen extra trains upon the southern part of their lino and reduce fares. The Dillsburg division will probably be converted into an electric road. Steam railroads everywhere are doing their best to delay and hinder the extension of electric railways, but the latter ire going ahead and are dividing passenger travel with the steam roads and greatly developing it. Congress. The Fifty-third Congress began its second session last Monday. A numtar of bills and resolutions have been introduced, but the opin ion prevails that no legislation of importance, tayond the passage of the regular appropria tion bills, will be effected. In the Senate, however, an effort is being made to change . the rules so that a limit to debate'may be fixed, and this would indicate that that lody, at least, is preparing to pass some important measures. It is not likely, however, that much will be done until after the Christmas holiday, tayond a consideration of appropriation bills. Several have been completed and reported. A Cheering Industrial Outlook. The Philadelphia Times savs:—“The gen eral industrial situation throughout the State continues to improve. With the end of tariff’ agitation, brought about by the passage of the Wilson bill, manufacturers began the work of adapting their interests to the change in trade conditions, and this revolution in betterments has been going on the past few months until the situation has become one of the best known in ten years. Resumption in iron and steel circles is general. In fact, there are now few idle mills, and idle mills exist simply on ac count of repairs.” ' A despatch says that Attorney General Olney has ordered the District Attorney for the Northern District of Texas to bring the five men convicted of the murder of sheriff Cross and his posse at the Hay Meadows, in No Man's Land, near the Kansas border, in 1888, to trial again. This case was supposed to have been finally settled when the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the District Court three years ago, and the condemned men were released on bail. The crime was the outcome of a county-seat war in Stevens i county, Kansas, in which Woodsdale and < Hngoton were rivals. THE 

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. A Statement of Our Foreign Helatlon*- Reeoinmeudation* n Tariff and Fi nancial Matter*—Cieneral Report on the Affair* of Government. President Cleveland submitted his annual message to Congress last Monday, and follow ing is a brief summary of its contents : The President’s message to the Congress of the United States presents iu an admiraldy clear manner the facts and measures requiring consideration at the hands of the national legislature. Our foreign relations are satis factory. The war between China and Japan is deplored, and in new of the dangers it brings upon Americans resident in the East the President declares that he “would not hesitate to heed any intimation that his friend ly aid for the honorable termination of hos tilities would be acceptable to both belliger ents.” Restrictions upon the importation of American food products into Belgium and Germany are noted, as also the “unreason able and unjust” fines imposed by Spain upon American vessels trading with Cluba and Porto Rico. Under the award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration $425,000 has been agreed upon as the sun to be paid as damages to British subjects on account of seizures of ves sels in Bering sea, and Congress is asked to ap propriate that amount. Thus far only France ana Portugal have assented to the regulations agreed upon with Great Britain. With^Rus sia a modus vivendi has taen reached in re spect to sealing interests in the North Pacific. Germany having protested against the pro vision ofthe tariff act imposing a discriminat ing duty of one-tenth oi a cent a pound on sugars coming from countries paying an ex port bounty thereon, claiming that such duty is in violation of the treaty of 1828 with Prussia, the President warmly recommends the repeal of so much of the recent tariff act as continues the discrimination first introduced in the McKinley act. Such repeal, it is add ed, is in the interests of the commerce of both countries, and is further desirable “to avoid even the accusation of treaty violation. The Bluefields incident is discussed at some length. By the treaty of 1860 Great Britain grunted Nicaragua sovereignty over the Mos quito Coast country, stipulating for the reten tion by the Mosquito Indians of a limited form of self-government. Recently Nicaragua sup pressed the native government, attempting to substitute for it “an impracticable composite administration.” Ultimately, after various conflicts, Nicaragua has established a local government at Bluefields. The rightful sov ereignity of Nicuragua over the Mosquito country’is not challenged. But wrongs were committed upon a number of American citi zens which were the occasion of remon strances. Samoa is shown to be in a very disordered state, consequent upon the faulty character of the “entangling alliance” for its govern ment entered into by the previous adminstra tion. The government set up by Germany, England and the United States, acting to gether under the Berlin treaty, has been un satisfactory to the natives. Civil wars are con stantly in progress, causing much expense to the three powers concerned. It is according ly recommended that Congress consider the propriety of our withdrawal from its engage ments with the other powers on terms not preiudical to our existing rights. The receipts of the government from all • sources of revenue during the fiscal year end ed June 30, 1894, amounted to $372,802,498^- 29, and its expenditures to $442,605,758.87, leaving a deficit of $69,803,200.58. It is esti mated that upon the basis of the present revenue laws the receipts of the government during the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, will be 5424,427,748.44, audits expendi tures $444,427,748.44, resulting in a deficit of $20,000,000. The strength of the army on September 30, 1894, was 2,135 officers and 25,765 enlisted men. While no considerable increase in the array is demanded by recent events, the policy ofseacoast fortification has so far developed as to suggest that the effective strength of the army be now made at least equal to the legal strength. It is noted in the report of the Attorney- General that the Supreme Court is overcoming rapidly the arrears of its business and it is suggested that Congress will do well to give an additional circuit judge to each circuit. The President further recommends the aboli tion of the fee svstemasn measure of compen- federal officers; the enlargement of the powers of United States commissioners, at least iu the Territories, the allowance off writs of error in criminal cases on l>ehnlf of the United States and the establishment of degrees in the crime of murder. The receipts of the Postotfice Department during the year amounted to $75,080,479.04 and the expenditures to $84,324,414.15. This deficiency is regarded as unnecessary, being due to an abuse of laws regulating rales upon second-class mail matter. If pretended news papers, trashy novels and other publications of like character were made to pay proper rates, and if the free distribution of seed through the mails were abolished, the income tints gained would suffice, it is thought, to per mit the carriage of legitimate papers and periodicals free of cost. The report of the Secretarv of the Navy shows gratifying progress in the construction of our new navy and presents with much earnestness a plea for the authorization of three additional battle-ships and ten or twelve torpedo-taats. The President accordingly recommends that provision be made for the construction of additional battle-ships and torpedo-boats, and also the manufacture of a reserve supply of guns for the auxiliary fleet. The transfer of the work of the coast survey to the Navy Department is urgently recom mended. The report of the Secretary of the Interior shows that the public domain still remaining amounts to a little more than 600.000,000 acres, excluding, however, about 360,000,000 acres in Alaska, as well as military reserva tions and railroad and other selections of lands yet nnadjsdicated. Though the condition ofthe Indians shows steady progress, their situ ation is not satisfactory at all points. Some of them to whom allotments of land have been made are found to be unable or disinclined to follow agricultural pursuits or to otherwise beneficially manage their land. At the close of the last fiscal year there were %9,544 persons on the pension rolls, being a net increase of 3,582 over the number report ed at the end of the previous year. Of these pensioners 32,089 are surviving, soldiers of Indian and other wars prior to the late civil war and the widows or relatives of such sol diers. The remainder, numbering 937,505. are receiving pensions on account of the civil war. ami ol these 469,344 are on the rolls under the authority of the act of June 27, 1890, sometimes called the dependent pension law. The total amount expended for pensions dnring the year was $139,804,461.05, and the sum necessary to meet pension expenditures for the vear ending June 80, 18%, is estimated at $140*,000,000. The Secretary of Agriculture shows that the exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1894, amounted to $628,363,038. being 72.28 per cent, of American exports of every description, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain took more than 54 per cent, of all farm products finding foreign markets. The advantages to the public service of an adherence to the principles of civil-sendee reform are constantly more apparent; and a vast majority of the voters of the land are ready to insist that the time and attention of those they select to perform for them import ant public duties should not be distracted by doling ont minor offices. Nuinerous additional offices and places hav3 lately been brought within civil-service rules. The new tariff act needs important amend ments so as to lie executed effectively and with certainty. In addition to such necessary amendments ns will not change rates of duty, the President still very decidedly favors putt ing coal and iron upon the free list. As regards the sugar schedule, he would be glad, “under existing aggravations,” to see every particle of differential duty in favor of refined sugar stricken out of the tariff law. Legislation is recommended calculated to promote the development of our merchant marine. To this end the new tariff should be supplemented by an act allowing vessels built abroad and owned by Americans to be regis tered here. Much space is given to a discussion of the decrease of the gold reserve and the necessity of a bond issue to repair the fund designed to keep all forms of money at par with gold. It is declared roundly that the issne of bonds will be continued “whenever and as often*’ as it is necessary to maintain a sufficient gold reserve. The currency question is declared to need the prompt attention of Congress, and a plan for the creation of a more elastic cur rency is presented and approved. The plan embraces a scheme modifying present banking laws and providing for the issue of circulating notes by State hanks free from taxation under certain limitations. It is proposed to repeal all laws providing for the deposit of United States bonds as se curity for circulation; to permit national tanks to issue circulating notes not exceeding in amount 75 per cent, of their paid-up and un impaired capital, provided they deposit with the government as a guarantee fund in United States legal-tender notes, including treasury notes of 1890, a sum equal in amount to 30 per cent, of the notes they desire to issue. In addition to the guarantee fund required it is proposed to provide a safety fond for the immediate redemption of the circulating notes of failed banks, by imposing a small annual tox, say one-half of 1 per cent., upon the average circulation of each bank until the j fund amounts to 5 per cent, of the total circa- ) lation outstanding. As a further security it | is contemplated that the existing provision | fixing the individual liability of stockholders j is to be retained and the bank’s indebtedness j ou account of its circulating notes is to be made a first lien on nil its assets. A very important feature of this plan is the exemption of State banks from taxation by the United States in cases where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury ami comptroller of the currency by tanks claiming such exemption that they have not had outstanding their circulating notes exceeding 75 per cent, of their paid up and unimpaired capital: that their stockholders are individually liable for the redemption of their circulating notes to the full extent of their ownership of stock; that the liability of said banks upon their circulating notes consti tutes, under their State law. a first lien upon their assets; that such banks have kept and maintained a guarantee fund in Unted Slates legal-tender notes, including treasury notes of 1890, equal to 30 per cent, of their outstand ing circulating notes, and that such banks have promptly redeemed their circulating notes when presented at their principal or branch offices. Governor Brown’s Popularity. The Centreville Observer, Queen Anne's county, ( Democratic ) soys : “Governor Brown has made some mistakes, as almost any man would do, but all in all he has given the State a good administration. His course has been upright, his administration a business one and economical. .He has prevented much ofthe waste of public money which sometimes attend administrations, and he has placed the State institutions in excellent shape. Even head of an institution in the State has been looked after, and the Governor has seen to it personally that proper rules and regulations are adopted and observed in their manage ment. He has made some enemies, of course, as all men will do who have positive rather than negative lives, but no man ought to be afraid of the enemies he makes when he is doing right. They cannot harm him ranch, but. on the contrary, their very enmity would be so hollow and ridiculous as to make friends for the man they hate. That Governor Brown may prefer to retire to private life and look after the large financial interests he has in ' charge is likely true, but we are not prepared to agree with the Governor that his retirement from office is made necessary by any public demand nor from the apprehension that the people would refuse him a re-election if nomi nated. Twenty Times a Mother. Oil City, Pa., Dec. 3.— Mrs. William . Steen, who, with her husband, lives on Colbert avenue extension, recently gave birth to her twentieth child. Mrs. Steen is only 88 years old. The oldest child is 21 years and there have been no twins or triplets in the family. The Missouri Pacific Railroad Company , has issued an order for the discontinuance of all night passenger trains on the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Division, tatween Coffey ville, Kansas, and Van Bnren, Arkansas, after December 9tb, owing to the lawless condition of the country and the frequent 1 train robberies.
