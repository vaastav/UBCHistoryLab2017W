A LnUy UadiyUurl.- t - One of those seddents that are of fre quent occurrence happened yesterday, re sulting in tho serious hurting of a very es timable' lady and tho tlislocauon of an arm. The public streets ana tnorongciares areho constandyaUveTOthrapidlyjnoving vehicles driven frequently with "inexcusable care lessness, that tho only wonaer u that accidents involving the I033 of life or limb, are not 61 more frequent occurrence than, they nre. In this instance. 'however, the accident ia altrib- Tited to no tmwonted degree of negligence on tho part of any one, as we understand tho case. It resulted in tho severely hurt: ing of tho lady, and for tho time endanger ing Ihe Iivos of two littlo children. The carnage ui uuxd. xjl. uuciwu, ui muuisuQ and two children were seated, was turned over and very badly smashed, injuring the lady quite severely. She was driving out home on unurcn street, when irom Borne cause the team became inghtened and dashed off at fearful speed up the street The horses were perfectly unmanageable, and despite the efforts oi the driver to rem them in, contmued to plunge right and ion as they mshod forward. With her littlo children and herself at tho mercy of two maddened steods the feelings of the lady, hightened by the screams of the littlo ones, it may well bo conceived bordered on tho tortures of despair. Tho horses continued to plungo forward till tney reacnea me corner of Church nnd McLomcro streets, when with a sudden lurch they overturned tho carriage, hurling the occupants into tho street airs. Shelton was very badly hurt being bruised about the body and having her wrist dislocated, ana was conveyea to the residence of Mrs. Wharton on Church street, -where she received tho surgical at tention of Dr. w.

Tlie Courtliooao Tendered to I lie Convention ThO third story of the Courthouse with the large and capacious- hall and tho rooms attached, has. with the consent of the County Court and all parties concerned, been tendered to tho use of the Convention soon to comnienco in the city. Tho tender was made through bquire Maxey, Chair man of the Courthouse Committee, and we have rio doubt but that it will be ac cented. Although the Supremo Court room has been ottered lor tho samo pur pose, tho deliberations of the Convention might conflict with the sessions of tho Court, in which case the latter wouiu nave precedence, as tho room is by legislative act specifically designed for Supreme Court purposes. The third story of the Court house, uosules the advantages oi a large and capacious had just suited to the worK- incs of the convention, has a number of spacious rooms attached, well adapted to consultations ot committees, etc it was commendable in the Court to make the of fer at all events. 1.10 00 36o 75 8.-.0 00 10 2,000 00 Tltirdcr. The Huntingdon Courier says: "On last Saturday. 11th inst, at Bed Mound, Henderson county, a Mr. Sharp was shot and instantly killed by bis brother-in-law, whose name we did not learn. It seems Sharp was endeavoring to shoot a citizen of the place, his brother-in-law tryins to prevent him, the gun accidontly being discharged in the scuiue. anarp strucs nis brother-in-law several severe blows on the head with the barrel, whereupon, he drew his pistol and shot Sharp through the body, killing him instantly. Both parties had been residents of Henderson County only a short time, having recently moved there from Lawrence." "We learn that on "Monday, Cth inst, at Decaturvifle, a young man by the name of Wm. Autrv. shot and killed S. L. McCluro upon very slight, if any provoca tion at all. Autrv- was under the influence of whisky at tho time." West Xnsuvlllc. We are gratified to hoto the marked im provement in tho appearance of the western suburbs of Nashville. Tho miserable shanties that have so long marred the beau ty of West Nashville, under the rigid re gime of our present city administration are rapidly msappeanng and giving place to the well-built and valuable brick edifices which hero and there dot its surface. The owners, too, of property there are begin ning to understand tho short-sighted policy of keeping their lots covered with inferior cabins, rcntmg tor a mere pittance, at tlie same time depreciating in value tho ground upon which they are built We were pleased to see the notice ol our emcient Uity .Mar shal warning parties against putting up light frame tenements in this part of our growing city. 1i such a course be carried out, we opine that this end of Nashville will erect first-class buildings in a very short space of time. Property iu this por tion of the city, as indeed elsewhere, is d.iily increasing in value. 5,780 00 Uniforming the Police. A preliminary meeting of a consultatory character, has just been had with reference to uniforming tho new police force. There is considerable interest manifested in this matter on tho part of the citizens, and it is no more than is duo the police themselves that they should have some spe cial uniform as designating and distinguish ing them from tho common people. They should be so uniformed as to be seen and known on tho streets, as well as for the purpose of identifying them a.1 a separate and distinct organization. Persons fre quently desiro a policeman in cases of special emergencies, when it is necessary that they should bo known in the night timo almost as far as seen. We understand that thero will soon be a meeting of those interested upon tho subject Old Pap TIioiiirn in a Huff. It is reported that Gen. Thomas has writ ten to a member of tho Legislature request ing to bo informed what his portrait now hung up in tho capitol, cost the estate and ho will refund tho amount and take the portrait. He is further reported to have stated that as soon as he got the gold medal presented to him by the Radical Legisla ture, now in New York, ho should return it to the State. The old fellow seems to have been "riled up" considerably at tho joke of tho Representative who offered a resolution a few weeks since to sell the portraits of Brownlow and Thomas, and with tho pro ceeds have that of Gen. Jackson painted and placed in the capitol. Death of J. i:. Sands. It is with feelings of deep retrret that wo announce tho death of our estimable fellow citizen Capt J. E.

Horrible Fate. Thursday night, a boy Apparently about sixteen years of age, applied at the police station for some place to sleep. He was taken to the Workhouse and furnished lodging through the night. Upon being questioned where he came from, he stated that he was from Massachusetts: that ho had been living at the Orphans' Home in that State ; that somo timo since the Stato agent for that institution turned about 150 boys and girls out ot the house and had them distributed through the country, leaving about ten at different cities. Ho said that ho was left at Johnsonvillo and made his way to this city, in hopes that he could find some eraplovmont Ho was poorly clad, and looked as if he was almost starved.

There is a very pestiferous and apt hog of the feminine gender that is a regular habitue of the Markethouse. bhe is an adept in the business of appropriating hams, steaks nnd poultry from the different stalls, and mating way wnn tne same. Yesterday morning she stole a ham and dashed off. Sho also mounted the stall with her fore feet and gobbled a magnifi- cent turkey, and rushed down tho street. After a chase of several squaros the owner succeeded in recapturing tho fowl, which he afterward sold at a small discount on the original prico demanded. This depredator of the porcine race must be the mother of the learned pig on ivonego sircei. Mrs. Craig's Ilcncfit.

We leam from tho Boston Commercial Bulletin that George F. Bakor, Treasurer of the Committee of Seventy-five, appoint ed by tho Convention of National Bankers, that mot in New York in Juno last, has ad dressed a circular to the National Banks of tho country, levying an assessment of $10 upon banks with a capital of less than $500,000, and $20 upon thoso with a capi tal exceeding that amount. As there are more than sixteen hundred National Banks duly organized, this first assessment will probably exceed $20,000, and it is a matter of interest to recall the measures proposed and for the mero inauguration of which such a large lobby fandis deemed requisite. Wo may assume, that Mr. Ponioroy, of New York, who presided over the conven tion which appointed this committee, fairly represented the intent and purpose of the convention, when he declared in favor of the establishment of an unlimited number of National Banks, with power to issue notes based upon a deposit of bonds with tho Comptroller of the Currency, and in favor of the repeal of that portion of the national banking law that requires the ac tual holding by the banks of two-thirds the amount of their liabilities in legal tenders. In Bhort, the proposition is to take away such safeguards as are now given to deposi tors, etc., in National Banks, and at the same time to extend their power over the commercial transactions of tho country by expanding tho volume of their circulation. Ilrcndstuffs In Lugland. It will be noted by the following para graph, which we oxtract from tho ilark Lane Express of the l'Jth of November, that the present low price of wheat in England is attributed to a panic caused by too free imports from America, and that.the depression is not shared in by the conti nental markets: Light rains, intermixed with -fogs and variations in the temperature, have pre vailed through the week, but theso have not. interfered with general field labor. Wheatrsdwing,' where growers prefer to bo late, has gone on successfully; whilo the young plants, .though not vigorous, look healthy on the whole, and may eventually nil fhn better for beintr backward. Tho London panic of Monday nas seriously told. upon the country marrow, wnicn may gen erally be considered as haying fallen 2s: "Aro we yet to go lower?" is tho anxious inquiry ; and very much must necessarily depend upon the will and ability of tanners to say "No!" The monetary question will, no doubt, in some measure influence thoso movements. Bents must be paid, and Christmas is coming; yet when this is got over, if not already provided for, wo may find a more cheerful opening for the new year. The principle of fear has indeed spread to Australia ; and a correspondent is alarmed on the supposition that wheat will be finally raised in California at sixpence a kn.lipi Late renorts thence, however, tell a very different tale, the quotations for fino nu.ilitv beinc S1.C5 ? 100 Ois, or 30a V I quarter, with freight to add, about 12s ? quarter, ana otner cxpousno, imu m country, it strikes us, few would like to be the porters of sand for such wretched pay.

Tho river was still rising at this point last evening, with 5 feet on Harpeth Shoals. The weather opened clear, but snow clouds' appeared before noon, and in the afternoon ,we had a considerable fall of snow, which melted about as fast as it felL The" Ella Hughes for tho upper Cumber land, 'had a very fair trip of groceries. The Talisman cleared for Cairo at a late hour last night. She had a goodly number of paksengors. The Spray in command of Capt. George Brown, departs for Cincinnati to-day at 12 o'clock. iL JL Dean in iha office. She belongs to the White Collar Palmerston vest line, and is all regular. The Lawrence leaves Cincinnati to-day for this port. The Tyrone is due to-morrow, and is the regular Tuesday packet for Cairo. The St. Louis Itepublican, of Thursday, says: "Tho weather yesterday was no improve ment over the preceding days, but was even mora disagreeable, it turned very cold,, and the airwas filled with fino particles of snow ana sleet during tne entire day. .Busi ness is becoming very dull, everyday show ing a large railing on in snipments. 10 New Orleans, freights are very scarce, and the packets aro compelled to hold over from one day to another to receive anything like a paying trip, itates to riew Urleans are nominal ; GOc per barrel was the general run of engagements yesterday, and wo heard of none below thi3 figure. To the Ohio river there was unusual activity, three racKets navinc departed ourincr tho day. Arkansas and Bed river freights are unim proved, 'ine river nero is rising rapidly. and more Ls reported coming down from the Illinois and other rivers. The season, though far advanced, has been unusually propitious to navigation. Last winter was a very mild one, but this season bids-fair to surpass tt; we judgo by the present sam pie." A correspondent says of the Little river, an aiuuent ot tne uuacnita: It Ls a handsome little river, just big enough at the upper end for small steamers to navigate, but not big enough to turn round in. We wont about twenty-five miles above tne mouth with our xteamar, and brought a fair showint? of cottem and seed. The south sido of the river is lined with cotton farms, as productive and as valuable as any in the world, making every year a bale to a bale and a half to the acre, The crops this season are splendid and re munerative enough to pay all losses caused by the vicissitudes of the past three years. The Muscatine (Iowa) Journal, of a re cent dato, contains the following': Last year tho Northern Line Packet Com pany lost $180,000. This loss was due principally to the fact of the low stage of water and strong competition of the White Collar Line, compelling both companies to carry passengers and freights at cutting rates, 'ihis year the consolidated Imp, with hich water, a daily throutm line be tween St. Louis and St. FauL and the able and efficient management of Capt. Ward uau DiuuiLi, uiej ituruigra liiue tym pany's stock has been mo3t remunerative. Y It has now twenty-one first class boats, and three new ones in process of construction. One of these is to be employed in the trade between Davenport and r ort Madison. It is 210 feet long, and is to be constructed with a view to speed as well as safety.
