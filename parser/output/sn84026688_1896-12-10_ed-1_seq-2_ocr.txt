WASHIHGTOW LETTER. From our Regular Correspondent. Washington, Dec. 7th, 1896. The Congressional mill began opera tions today, but if the other mills that have lately started their machinery do not do more to bring about good times than this session of Congress is likely from any present indications to do, we shall not have good times for sometime to come. President Cleveland’s message is interesting enough in its way, and if he had a party behind him able to con trol legislation, some of bis recommen dations might have attracted wide at tention, but as be is virtually playing a lone hand very little interest is express ed ia the message with its seventeen thousand words. One Senator jocular ly remarked of it; "Cleveland didn t write that message for the fifty-fourth Congress, but for posterity and history; perhaps they will give his ideas the at tention that Congress denies them, but I have my doubts.” If the tendency to increase the length of the Presidents messages to Congress is kept up, it will soon be in order to do away with read ing them in the Senate and House Many think it already in order. The Senators and Representatives all have printed copies of the message, placed in their hands before the reading begins, so that the reading is nothing more than a perfunctory formality at best. Additional Locals. The Town Hall fair will open December 22nd. In one respect it will exceed all that we have held; in the matter of entertainments something exceptionally fine will be given every evening. Mr. Edward Koontz, a prominent citizen of Frederick, president ot the Junior Fire Company and Internal Revenue Collector for this district, died on Tuesday last, aged about 68 years. The Gleaners Beneficent Association of Trinity Reformed church will render a spec ial program next Sunday evening, December 13lh at 7 o’clock, at which time Mrs. Dr. Cyrus Cort, late of Japan, who labored seven years as a missionary in that country, will lecture on Japan. The lecture will be quite a treat for our people. The public is cordi ally invited to be present. Come early in order to secure a scat. [communicated] Editor Clarion I was much gratified by the reference made in your editorial col umns to the series of lectures given in Ply mouth church on the “Bible as Literature,, 1 by Dr. Lyman Abbott. Not because of the meager information conveyed in the brief extracts but because It is a new and praise worthy departure in the newspaper to give attention and space to the discussion of such questions- The people are interested in these themes, and could with profit to themselves and others, stand more of it; but unfortunate ly all such discussions are confined to our high-priced monthlies and other standard periodicals which very rarely make their appearance in the average home. Dr. Abbott is one of the ablest scholars and most esteemed Christians in the orthodox communion. He is to Congregationalism what Dean Stanley and Matthew Arnold were, and Canon Farrar and Heber Newton are to the Episcopal church; what Dr. Lori mer and Prof Loy are lo the Baptist com munion, aud what Drs. Briggs and Barrows are to Presbyterianism. Prof. Loy has been for the past twenty years, while iu fellowship With the Baptist communion, teaching in Harvard College, the views of the so-called “Higher Criticism,” 1. c., the Bible from a rational standpoint based upon the ripest scholarships of Germany and England. Rabbi Hirsch, the most liberal Reform Jew in this country as Professor of Hebrew Lit erature is today leaching the same views in the new Chicago University. Prof. Paul 

OASTOTHA. Haupt in Johns Hopbine University, and it is superfluous to add that the presidents ol our leading universities would not occupy their positions were they not abreast with the same ripe Scholarship. Our wisest think ers are coming to see that if the Bib’.o is to retain its hold upon the minds and hearts of the people, it must be by our bravely taking it tor what it is—as literature pure and sim ple, written and inspired in no way different from other literature, and while recognizing Its many scientific inaccuracies and errors, they ore endeavoring to point out its beauty, value and religious helpfulness as literature. With a rational view of the bible entrenched in our minds, we can take up the study of a standard author without the fear of gomg into religious spasms over every statement that does not conform to our traditional ideas. Nay, we can go further, aud study even sci entific evolution without losing or lowering our faith in God and man. The above schol ars so far as I have been able to interpret their writings in our standard periodicals, arc believers in a theory of evolution which makes unnecessary the miracle of a special creation, and regard as a beautiful myth common to other races and religions, the stories of creation contained in Genesis, chapters 1 and 2. The unity of all life from monad to man as announced by Emerson, crudely stated by Darwin, amply reviewed and correctly restated by Huxley, Tyndal', Wallace, and others, and pul into form ns American literature by John Fiske, never had as many believers within the orthodox communion as it has today. Once learn through our daily press which goes into every home, what our ablest scholars are thinking and saying on these high themes, and no churchman with a mere pooh, pooh, and wave of his hand, can sweep away from our minds the finest results of modern scholar ship . A. J. Nonnrs. Graceliam Items. Mr. L. C. Smith lost his faithful and trusty horse, "Old Frank,” on Sunday night last. It was a case of 100 high living. The annual preparations for Christmas are being made. The title of exercise selected is "Hail the King." With sorrow we note the death of Mrs. William Buhrman who was stricken down with paralysis on Friday night the 27th, ult., and after a week’s illness died on Saturday afternoon last. She had been in very poor health for more than a year past and suffered from frequent attacks of severe nervous pros tration and heart trouble. Mrs. Buhrman was in her 60th year. The funeral services were held on Tuesday morning by the gath ering of a large relationship and friends, and her remains were interred in the family lot upon our cemetery. The family have the deep sympathy of our people in this their great bereavement. Interesting Rumors. —We note in the daily papers statements, more or less direct, to the effect that the W. M. U. R. Co is de bating the question of the removal of their shops from Union Bridge. Hagerstown and Williamsport are both hoping to profit by such action, but as both cannot, so should neither have any reasonable hope of securing them. No wise management places shops at the terminus of the road. At the shops are to be found the idle engines, wreck outfit aud the entire emergency men and equipment of the road and no other than the midway lo cation admits of perfect efficiency. It is at Thunuont that these conditions are met; it is nearer to Emory Grove and Highfield Junctions than Hagerstown and equidistant from Edgemout Junction. Further, it is at the foot of the grade whcie a‘‘help< r” engine would take the freight trains lo the top of the mountain instead of dividing them here, as Is now frequently done. As between Ship pensburg or Cherry Run and Baltimore, we arc almost exactly midway We do not lack a single advantage or facility possessed by another point on the line of road, and in ad dilion to the essentials already noted, cheap laud and low rents lor employes are lo be quoted in favor of Thunnont. President Bokee in an after-dinner speech here on the occasion of the formal opening of the road, in Mcchanicstown, twenty-fix years ago, said this point was destined to become “the Piedmont of the Western Maryland Railroad,” and to our people these words have never ceased re echoing with a proph etic ring; it may be that that prophecy is about to be fulfilled. The present management is not given to sentimental policies ; the road has grown to be the pretentious system that it is,under that management, aud solely by the application of strictly business principles lo an aggressive policy and on this circumstance is grounded the strongest hope that Thunnont may win in this contest for re location of the shops. We believe that an impartial judgment, from a strictly “railroad” pointof view.wo’d award to Thurmont to be the end of divisions, cast and west, the helpers’ station and hence, perforce, the Company’s shops. Further, the Company owns a large tract of land here, unfortunately not well suited lo be a site for the shops, but which would be increased in value as building sites, lo an ex tent that it is no over-estimate to lay it an offset against the entire cost of transfer of shops, and besides, the W. M- R. R. Co. knows the temper of Thurmont; it has alrea dy bought two depot sites and will buy any other desirable thing that it secs. The Business Men’s Association has herein once again an opportunity to give some evi dence of vitality; it is splendidly equipped for such work and a very plain call to duty is sounded, if there be aught of foundation for these rumors. Hints for Home, Sweet Home. [From the New York Press.] Carpets of alligator-skin wear longer than ingrain for kitchen use. To remove fly specs from the ceiling rub it with a hot flat iron. To remove stains from fine napery, paste them to a tin roof aud beat them with a sec tion ol rubber hose during each rain storm. To prevent colored stockings from fading, rinse them out lightly in red ink and boil them an hour in water to which has been added a soup bone. When clothing has acquired a close, un pleasant odor from being packed away where the Mr cannot get at it, lay a few tallow candles between the folds and pul for an hour in a hot oven To restore gilding to picture frames, re move ail cobwebs with a lawn mower and wash the gilt with a mixtuie of French shoe blacking and the yolk of an egg. Dry quickly by rubbing briskly with an old pair of trousers. Culture Owing to the existence of a counter-attrac tion the Club omitted its usual meeting last Friday and the few members who came to gether enjoyed an informal talk instead of the program announced for the evening. The aforesaid program will be given on next Friday with the addition of seven chapters of Romola, i. c., Bth to the 15th; meeting to be held at the usual lime and place. Reflection* of a Bachelor. [From the New York Press ] There are very few men who aren’t asham ed of some of their relatives. When a man admires a married woman and she knows it, she will never admit that he is homely. Why is it when women sleep together they always spend hall the night talking about their husbands? When a man tells another man about his approaching marriage, he tries to use a jaded, matter of-fact lone. A woman never sees a fussy little wedded net cap for a baby without wanting to smug gle her face down iu it. The worst tempered woman in the world tries her best to look angelic when she lias her picture taken with a baby in her lap. A woman can never quite understand what is going to become of her husband when they get to heaven, If there is no such thing as marriage there. The average man spends the first six months after his marriage wondering why he didn’t do it sooner, and the next six wonder ing why he did. it at all. On November 10th. in Frederick, by Elder P. D.

Rut a man V care °f himself has ■ /■ I / more pain and mis- H j M lj ery crowded into one LT 'healthy, hearty man would ever know of When a man’s stomach is out of order, and his digestion don’t work; when his liver gets to be sluggish and won’t clear the bile out of bis blood, it is time for him to look out for himself. He gets no nourishment out of his food. His blood gets thicker and thicker with impurities. His nerves get irri tated. He loses energy and fighting force. He may aay, “ I can stand it, 1 will feel better to-morrow;” but the chances are he will feel worse to-morrow and worse still next day. He ought to put himself right at once. He needs Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery. It is made for just this condition. It rouses up the digestive and nutritive organs, and gives them power to extract from the food all the nutritious elements and transform them into rich, nourishing blood. It enables the liver to cleanse out all bilious impurities and pour into the circula tion an abundance of highly vitalized blood, full of the life-giving red corpuscles which build up healthy flesh, muscular strength, and nerve-energy. It does not make flabby flesh. It is the only suitable tonic and atrengtb-builder for corpulent people.
