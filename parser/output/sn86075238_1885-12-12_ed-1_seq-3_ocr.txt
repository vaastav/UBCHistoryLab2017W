GREAT FALLS TRIBUNE. P b Pub1ll.siB Every Satlraay at rret Falii, M. T n WILL HANKS, PusLBLIsn. ie{c _-- a .NOTIC.E. c' MR. GEORGE BUDINGTON is the an- o thorized agent of the TaRnuxE to so licit subscription, job work and ad vertising. All contracts made by b him will be faithfully carried out by t1 this office. Senator Sherman will preside over v over the senate. v Special Inspector Gunn of the land department. tells the Inter Mi mntain that he is investigating the mineral and agricultural land entries in Mon- e tana, that he has found some fraudu lent entries, principally by large pirop orty holders; that there are more of them in the vicinity of Miles City than in all the rest of the Territory put together, but that there is more fraud in one land district in I)akota than in all Montana. He think_ tii he issuance of patents will pI:og ress steadily and rapidly after the first of c January. Husbandman: Since it has b-n demonstrated b1) actual test that the barley produced in Montana is supe rior, for making beer, to that grown in the states, a new field of industry has been opened to the Montana far mer. All the two-rowed barley in Gallatin county. and in other Mon tana valleys traversed by the North ern Pacific railroad, has been pur chased at fair figures by St. Paul and Milwaukee brewers, and shipped I thither to be manufactured into beer, the demand, we are credibly inform ed, being much greater than the sup ply. This is good news to our grain growers. Barley is one of the most successful crops grown in the territo ry. It is a sure crop. matures early. and is, therefore, in but little danger of frost; is hardy and- requires less water than other grain, and with- I stands the ravages of grasshoppers bet ter than any crop grown. It is espec ially adapted to high rolling lands and there are tens of thousands of 1 acres in the territory that have not yet been supplied with water that would grow excellent barley without irrigation and that may be profitably cultivated in this crop. One very im portant point in favor of this branch of husbandry is, the prices are better than are realized for other grain. The fact that in the future anyone who has good barley for sale can realize a good price for it, will greatly increase its production, and if we do not great ly over estimate the value of the Mon tana product, staple barley is bound to become one of our chief agricuntur- I al exports, and our territory become the greatest barley producing region in the known world. 

TROOPS FORL UTAli. An Omaha, Neb., telegram, dated the 5th says: Late last night it be came known that mysterious order had been received at military head quarters here. Gen. Howard, the 0 commanding officer, was out of the b city but was telegraphed for and re turned at six o'clock this morning. He refused to give any definite infor mation on the orders. It is learned, however, that Batrerry B, from Fort Omaha, was ordered to Fort Doug- I lass, Utah, at once. They left at 2 o' clock this afternoon. It is understood that all the troops in the department c have been ordered in readiness for c movement at a momnont's notice. From the fact that the troops are bound for Utah the general impress ion is that Mormon troubles are ex pected, but of exactly what nature all f efferts have failed to disclose. One i theory is that the President's message will contain an expression on the Mor t mon question which may create a dis turbance. THE 

CRISIS PASSED. ( SALT LAKE, Dec. 6.-All is quiet here. There is no probability of trouble. The precautions for the preservation of life and property are < ample. The action of Gov. Murray and Gen. McCook in reporting the t threatening situation here and get ting the authorities to station troops I in the city and the ordering of rein forcements here, have removed all ap prehensions for the present. McMur in, supposed to have been fatally shot by Deputy.Marshal Collin, is recover ing. The whole trouble in the city of second-class Saints originated from the shooting of a Mormon by a Depu ty U. S. Marshal, who was attacked by a crowd of Mormon hoodlums. A regiment of soldiers are camped in the city, and any outbreak will quick ly be quelled. THE CARSON MINT. The Salt Lake Tribune editorially says: Carson City, Nevada, is badly shaken up over the mint question. Secretary Manning has ordered the mint to be closed and all the employes, except the superintendent, discharged. This is hard on the little town and a great inconvenience to the miners in western Nevada and eastern Califor nia. In their wrath the Carson peo ple; in the meeting they have read the las, which says that " gold and silver bullion shall be received at the several mints of the United States and ex changed for coin," and on that clause some of the abl!e lawvycs declare that a mandamus can j be made available in compelling thlr pridal'it of the U Ciitedi States and the treasury secretary to , obe: the law. They alho assert that a justice Field of the supreme court s has just given it as his opinion that t: the closing of the mint was unlawful.i We syuumpathizo with the people, but we are afraid that the 1lupo>itioli n will not work; that befor e the mater would come to a heariing, cong'res I would orler the ldi.smanitli ", iihe mint and the 1 l rit ' oiv' of the dri:'ls , and tle ch :-.ic·. are if:t while c the people have a first-el. s oppor tun':ity to da:nm the ,dmi:ii7 tt )io, the mandamus willt t+,. v . n - t C i' l.. . ..

The entire Lost River and Birch i Creek reg)io is steadily improving. and will soon equaln, if not surpass. the Wood lliver :etin. says the Ida ho le~gister of the 2eth. At the for- Ii iner place the lodes are much larger, it I and much of the ore fnlly as gpgod as d that of Wood River. In fact. sotme p of it is much richer, na shown at the s< Horn Silver mine. Next year the w boom will bIegin, and soon there will a! be many claims worked which v ill turn out much bullion and givo work a to thousands of men. There is no n reason why this region, when onec e started up, should not equal Butte, q for it is claimed by practical men who a have seen both places that the Lost River section shows mnich the best to £f begin with. At the latter place tLere o are all the metals, and many of the t0 outcrops of these lodes show large ii bodies of ore, almost equal to that b found in the older camps, like Butte r and Leadvilie, at greater depths. So a it is highly probable that when these e mines, too, are developed, like those elsewhere, we will have a great min- h Sing region near Eagle eock, and will ( make another Denver of this place. t The prospects are favorable, and it is v only a question of time when all these ai changes will materialize right before t our eyes. C AN ACENT lll:Sl(tNS. The Yellowstone Journal learns 1 from a gentleman who accompanied a Maj. Walton. the newly appointed i agent of the Northern Cheyennes, to the agency last week and who was present at the injuiry into the alleged disturbance. that the Indians had made no h4,,tile demonstrations what ever, but that owing to the beggardly t j quoto of food issued to them they are f really in a suffering condition and il e ly prepared to face the rigors of the e coming winter. As a rule agency In Y dians have no cause for comploint on I e this score, but these poor devils labor under the disadvantage of having s been reported for years past as nearly self supporting, in consequence of - which, their rations have been cut down to beef and flour, which they t cannot be expected to supply them selves with; all other articles of food which it is their right to receive from )f the government have been cut off on n account of the belief existing in the i- department that they had an abund d ant supply from the result of their s. own labor, while the truth is they have not this year and never have produced enough to subsist one fami ly through the winter. Maj. Walton the new agent, after having looked the ground over carefully, decided ly that in the present state of affairs he ly could neither do justice to himself a. nor the Indians, and on his return to ie the railroad at once telegraphed his is, resignation of the position of agent. d. Gen. Armstrong, inspector of Indian a agencies, was also present at the in council held, and, taking note of the >r- deplorable candition of the Indians, te- will at once report it to Washington. 

WASHINGTON LETI'ER.I td [From our Regular Correspondent.] ti WisrINGTON, Nov. 28, 1885. at The Administration is now mourn- I in; for Vice-President Hendlricks. T!,hank:;giving day was a sad and to quiet one at the White House. There w were no callers, no business was trans- i' acted, and decorators were busy out- to side putting u) the crape and bunting hI that will shroud the columns of the a: Executive mansion until the day after ti Christmas. The Capitol and Govern fr ment buildings are also draped in tl: black, the same designs being followed hi that were used inseuomory of General si Grant. Mr. Hendricks' death gives the S Presidency of the Senate to the h; Republicans, as they are the majority c( in that body. It is customary at the I) close of a session of the Senate for the e Vice-President to leave the chair for I a time and permit the election of a (a Preide-nt of the Senate pro tempo:e ye in order thit there might be a uec t l cou'thi ey I. , 'th ' __'i Ch,. ' a , I ti a >;[r 11",en'ounryi"" is i'W in the :ami.n Sclition that it was during the firls nii:,th of Mr. .rthu':; ire sid.ency. iHe also loet the Senate without having - it nanne a ipro temi)ore presdling of'icer. The situation naturally gives (( rise to discussion of ,proper 1Tws to t regulate the Presidential succession, and it is probable that the incoming Congress will be urged to make some ena:tment to meet such contingencies. i The last Vice-President who d(lied in ofeice was Mr. Wilson of Massachin - setts. His death was as sudden as that of Mr. Hendricks, occurring, it will be remembered, while he was presiding over the Senate. When the death of MJr. Hendricks was announced at the White House, Mr. Cleveland immediately called a special session of the Cabinet. Act ion was taken in regard to the funeral, which the President and Cabinet will atte, , . The Senators and Representatives in the city also held meetings for the purpose of dieiding upon committies to attend the barial services. The people of WVashington obeyed 1 - j the terms of the President's procla Imnation in celebrating Thanksgiving Sday. Government business was sus peonde:l, Department clerks and school children were set free, there were family reunions and feasting 1 1 and pleasure making. In thechurch O es sermons were preached from appropriate texts. Secretary Whit ney offered to give every officer and emuploye of the Navy Department a Thanksgiving turkey. Many of them availed themselves of his courtesy. t Congress will convene in one week a from next Monday. There is a bustle e of preparation at the Capitol. It is true the work of cleaning up, repair e ing, and making improvements has t ibeen going on there during the entire e recess. Still everything is getting o another touch in readiness for the e event. The President has nearly finished t his message to Congress, and the Cabinet officers have about completed their reports. The majority of them will be published before Congress meets. Only that of the Secretary of t the Treasury will be withheld to go to Congress with the President's mes sage. As to the points in the message it may be mentioned that the policy of the Administration will be very clear and direct in advocating increased economy in Governmental expendit ures and cutting down tariff taxation in such a way as will not hurt indus tries which have been built up under existing laws. The policy outlined to Congress will be conservative. One of the newly appointed Civil Service Commissioners says that any expectations that the reorganized Commission will be governed by partisan considerations will be doom ed to disappointment. He further said in all his consultations with the President, he was impressed with the sincere purpose Mr. Cleveland show ed to enforce the law strictly and impartially. The majority of the Senators of both parties favor a mod erate Civil Service reform. They are pleased to be rid of the annoyance of looking after small places, but they would like te obtain control of ap pointments to the higher positions. 

COMMISSIONER ATKINS' REPORT. Gen. J. D. C. Atkins, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, has submitted his annual report to the Secretary of the Interior for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1885. The commissioner prefaces his report as follows: "It requires no seer to foretell or forsee the civilization of the Indian race as a result naturally deducible from the knowledge and practice upon their part of the art of agriculture, for the history of agriculture among all people and in all countries intimately connects it with the highest intellect nal and moral development of man." He conclude his report as follows: "In reference to their government, they must abandon tribal relations, the must give up their superstiticn-, they must forsake their savage habits and learn the arts of civilization, tney must learn to labor, and must learn to rear their families as white people do and to know more of their obligations to the government and society. In a word, they must learn to work for a living, and they must understand that it is their duty to send their children to school. When the farm and school have become familiar institutions among the Indians and a reasonable time has intervened for transition from barbarism or a semi-civilized state to one of civilization, then will the Indian lb prepared to take upon himself the higher and more respon sible duties and privileges which ap pertain to American citizenship. There are in the United States. exclu sive of Alaska, 2t00,000 Indians, fully half of whom have as yet declined to commit themselves to the life of a far mor. Exclusive of the lanmds cultivat ed by the five civilized tribes, the number of acres in cultivation by the Indians during the year was 218,241, acres. an iacrease of 18,373 over last 8 years' figures." c< R,,:tTONS WOOL 31ARKET'.

When Vice-President l Hendricks died the news was not de livered to the Journal till 6:25. The Seditors, pressman, stereotypers, com positors and everybody else, except one man in the business office, had gone home to supper. The fires had gone out in the stereotyping room and the machinery was cold. At 8:30 a however, the Journal had an extra edition on the street containing near ly a column in regard to the late vice Il president and his death. Fifteen hundred copies were scl.d cto the ' streets of Minn ea"polis bcre 10 0 o'clock. An effort :cas made to catch 5 the 3:30 taanin for St. Paul :rith a part of the extra edition. Failing in that by about three minutes, t f:s te-am was procured, and in tire: -.ln'r-t rs of an hour the newsboys of St. I'aul were filling the streets with: '."ire's ver ;Minneapolis Journal! All about the death of Vice- Uro f3::-? I:'an lh l ricks." Six hundred copies vr: ':old Sby 11:30, at prices ran:ging from 5 to - 15 cents, and then the su.ply ,ave out. The eagerness with ',hi:-i the papers were bought indicated that a thousand could have been sold as ea ' sily as 600. The news recently brought to Mis- - soula, says the Butte Town Talk, about the discovery of rich placers at Big Hole, Beaverhead county, 109 miles south of Missoula, just over the divide between two counties, is con firmed. The find is in Big Hole gulch, s one mile west from Gibbon's battle ground and extends up the Big Hole gulch about ten miles, and the dis trict is about one mile wide. Thos. \Ward, Daniel Feighner. Charles Hawkes and C. B. Mahoney of Mis soula, and Lee Mantle and others of Butte, eight altogether, are the loca tors. The discovery was made on the 21th of last month. Billy Edwards R rocked out a. trifle over $100 in nine hours, which the bank bought. The A bank purchased 18 ounces at $18.50 B per ounce. One man washed out $25 per day. Edwards and Law have got ground which it is claimed will iun C $35 a day to the man. Tom Warren, sergeant-at-arms of the last house of representatives of Montana, with Ed wards, have left for the diggings. The former will be back in a week. It is a three days' trip from Missou!a, and there is a good road all the way. Wolf & Co. sold out a claim to Mor mon parties for $5,000, and the latter are now working it. It is claimed that it will run 25 cents to the pan. There is great excitement and a stam pede from the upper Bitter Root val ley.
