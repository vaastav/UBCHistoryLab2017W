Eebel Chief Enters the State Capital The Federals Flee to the Border. (Continued from pare 1.) follow Villa Into the capital. Two ar tillery trains will also enter the city. Barracks in which to house the men and corrals for the horses are being- Bet aside by the pro tern civil officials of the capital, it le reported. Frederico Moye. civil governor of the state ad interim, is said to be well acquainted with "Villa and is making every effort to see that the rebels find accommoda tions when they arrive. Moye's author ity will cease when the rebel general sets foot in the capital, unless Villa allows him to continue as governor. Where Ih Mrrcndo? If "Constitutionalist" authorities in Juarez have any knowledge as to the location of the federal army under Gen. Mercado, they are keeping it to them selves. "I don't know," is the invari able answer to all questions put to them concerning the whereabouts of the Huerta troops. Except for the hint given by Villa Wednesday that the fed erals would probably "have to fight" before reaching Ojinaga. there is no indication that any effort is being made ty the rebels to intercept the federals and give them battle. Itenalrlnc Xorth Western. Ko trains will leave Juarez today for the south over the Mexican Central railway, according to an announcement made this morning at military head quarters. Work of repairing the Mex ico North Western railway between Chl huahua and Juarez is well under way and officials of the line say that traffic should be resumed, under present con ditions, by the middle of December. The reopening of the North Western, which lias been out of commission on account of burned bridges, and destroyed cul verts means much to this section, which feeds western Chihuahua with supplies of all kinds. To Increase Juarez Garrison. Within a week, the Juarez garrison of 1700 men will be augmented by the arrival of 800 Sonora volunteers under the command of Col. E. P. Calles. This column, which comes to join Villa, has teen on the march for three weeks and -was expected in Juarez several days ago.

It is not known whether this force will be sent to Chihuahua or will remain in Juarez as part of the garrison. Carranza to Juarez? Is Gen. Venustiano Carranza coming to Juarez? If so, nobody in Juarez fcnows it, officially. The most definite -word regarding Carranza's probable movement from Sonora eastward was given Wednesday by Gen. Villa, who said he thought Carranza would prob ably join him in Chihuahua shortly, coming overland from Hermoslllo with a column of -4000 men, led by Gen. Al vardo, -who has been ordered to join Villa for the march on Mexico City, it -will take Carranza at least eight or nine davs to make the trip orerland and his" arrival, either in Juarez or Chihuahua, is not looked for before Friday week.

FORCED LOANS WILL SUFFICE, SAYS HUERTA Power Are Reported to Have Been Notified of Intention of TJ. S. to Isolate Hcertn Financially. Mexico City, Mexico, Dec 4. That Mexico is self-supporting and that forced loans, if necessary, will tide the country through its crisis, is the as sertion of president Huerta. He said he has no intention of yielding, and that should the fighting continue for years, he will continue to do his part in it, if still alive. The enunciation of Washington's policy does not appear to have alarmed the Mexican dictator. It is understood that the representa tives of the powers here have been notified that the policy of the United States is to isolate the Huerta govern ment financially. Unconfirmed reports have been re ceived that Zacatecas had been at tacked and Saltillo threatened by the rebels. Another report says the gar rison at Monterey has mutinied. There is no direct communication between Mexico City and Monterey. The devel opments with respect to Chihuahua and the departure from that town of the federal forces have not been published here.

SAYS PARIS PAPER Paris, Brance. Dec. 4. "President Wil son is taking a grave responsibility in his determined efforts to overthrow provisional president Huerta because his dictatorship is the only organized social force still existing in Mexico," says the Temps, in commenting on president Wilson's message to the American congress.

WALT MASON The Famous Prose Poet The Famous Prose Poet. it "T"HE wonder is," observed the J wild man of the woods, "that any married men remain in the busy haunts. Most wives are ex cellent people, and few husbanls de serve them, yet, with the best inten tions in the world, they make things uncomfortable around the home. The good husband would rather suffer In silence than wound his wife's feelings, and so he goes ahead suffering until he can endure no more, and then he flees to the forest primeval where na ture applies a balm to his bruised and broken spirit. "I feel quite satisfied that few mar ried men have been so blessed in their wives as I was. My wife was a truly wonderful woman, and I have never ceased to admire her splendid quali ties of mind and heart, but there were some things she couldn't understand. For instance, she was determined to keep me supplied with home-made slippers. She was always making them out of colored wool and other ma terials. If there is anything I detest. It is home-made slippers. The ones my wife used to make were so con structed that nobody but a civil engi neer could distinguish the right one from the left, and they looked like billboards. I always felt as though I was wearing a pair of pies on my feet when I had them on, and when visitors came to the house in the evening I was so ashamed that I hid my feet under the sofa. Nothing Is better cal culated to make a man look ridiculous than homemade slippers, which remind spectators of the mottoes women used to make out of colored wool.

Mexico during a generation. It is only since the revolution in the name of con stitutionalism was begun that Mexico has fallen into anarchy and chaos, in which the "Constitutionalists" them selves are the worst factors. "One cannot fail to be struck by the contrast between the tranquil and studied idealism with which president Wilson follows out his Mexican policy and the brutal realities reported in even the mildest dispatches from Mexico."

FEDERALS SEND TROOPS INTO THE OIL DISTRICTS Veracruz, Mex., Dec. 4. The govern ment is making every effort to strengthen the federal forces operating against Gen. Aguilar In the oil regions.

So I put the bought slippers in me stove ana wore tne nomemade ones, professing such abundant ad miration for them that my wife finally relented, and the white winged dove of peace got in its work in our hum ble home once more. "My wife was always making; out landish things and expecting me to wear them. She was extremely proud of the par nftris hJia trmrtfl nut nf mtr cast-off trousers. They looked like t pancaxes and no man would be found dead in them. Every morning, In cold weather, that admirable woman would see that I nut on mv ear nad before I left the house, and then she'd stand ' at the window watching me until I ' turned the corner, and thinking how ' happy and comfortable I must be with those lovely things on my ears. But ' as soon as I turned the corner I took them off my ears and chucked them f into my overcoat pockets. Better to have my ears frozen a dozen timrs i than to meet anybody I knew and be i exposed to the scorn of the populate , And when I'd get home in the evening my wife would ask me a dozen ques tions about those ear pads and the amount of comfort I got out of them.

Because the property owners along the route of the proposed scenic drive way would not donate the rightofway, and the city was not financially able to purchase the needed space, alderman W. S.
