W?DNE8DAY BVKNINO, DEC. 11. 1W>1 With th? death o? Judge Hughe*, whioh occurred at Abiagdoo yesterday, tbe last of a trio ol famous Virginia jjumallete fate paaeed into tbe apirit world. Io ante bellum days a trinar Tirate of able writers, composed of the deceased aod John M. Daniel aod Pat? rick Heory Aylett, made th? old Riob? mond Examiner one of tbe ablest and most readable papers published south of Mason and Dixon'a line. Its in? fluence waa unbounded and the utter ?noes of these gentlemen, each of whom possessed a rigorous mind ?nd a pro? pensity for reedy wrltiog, were read throughout ail Dixie land. They were at the front when the times tried men's soul?, when the blood of both sections was at fever heat ?nd at ? oritical period of the country's history, when editorial expressions were not al way e regarded in ? Pickwickian sense. This trio, fearless ?nd outspoken, played their parts, ?nd were probably as in? strumenta) in bringing States' rights to tbe test of tbe sword a? ?ny otbers in tbe South, ?nd throughout the four years' war tbe Examiner was read witb avidity by ?11 wbo could obtain it, ?nd soldiers in the Confederate army liter ?lly passed it down the line as one ?iter ?nother imagined tbey must read it even If they missed their breakfast. Tbe Judge was one of the last of tbe old-time Virginia editors. His desth brings to mind many interesting reminiscences of the upe aod downs of old Virginia. Tempora motantur, etc., is a true observation, bat th? standard of the newspaper of tbe olden time, so well remembered by many now in the sere and yellow leaf, brings to mind reminiscences of by-gone days when galaxies like the above wrote with spirit and when tbe yellow journal was unknown and tbe newspaper bad ? oharaoter whioh was never besmirch? ed with Billlogsgate nor groundless eensationlsm. ??? ii?.. riM_i It HAS been deemed proper by the Methodist hymnal revision committee now in eession in Cinolnnatl to elimi? nate from th? collection of psalms, hymn?, and spiritual songa two wbioh are destined to become immortal, their action to the contrary notwithstanding. One is that soothing old favorite, "Sweet Hour of Prayer," hummed by many pione souls in struggles to rise superior to the ills and frets of life. Tbe other is like unto it?"He Leadeth Me"?the expression of a sincere be? liever who is persuaded that at tbe end of life's dark mazes he will find that bis path, torturous and rugged as it some? times is, has led direct to tbe eternal oity. These beautiful breathings of spirituality have come to stay and if one denomination repudiates tbem there is no law of tbe land to prohibit others from enjoying tbem. Ripbkskni ativk Wachtbb, of Mary? land, thinks of introducing a joint r?so? lution prohibiting in future the annual foot ball game between the cadets of West Point and those of Annapolis. He characterise football as more brutal than prize fighting and more dangerous to life and limb. And tbe game as now played ia just aa Mr. W?chter describes it, and for this very reason has it be? come so popular that men and women travel miles and pay entrance fees to see the "encounters" just as they did lnthedajs of Rome to see the gladia? tors. During the season just closed over one hundred young men were killed in "playing" at foot ball, while the number of injured ran np into tbe thousands. Bat tbe tendenoy of the ?ge is toward excess, ana now nothing la moderation satisfies tbe masse? of tbe people. On tub first business day of Congress ?bout one hundred bills were introduced that carried appropriations of a more or lese greedy nature. This was merely the beginning. Comparatively few o the members got in tbeir work, and yet tbe aggregate amount demanded by these few is $80,000,000. Tne est i mated enrplus for tbe fi-cal year end? ing June 80, 1902, is $100,000,000. This 1 Ule rush of bills would take oare of ubaut one-third oftbat enormous sur? plus. Asie well said by tbe New York San, "Mr. Henderson's warning and plea for economy do not seem to have worked very actively as a deterrent." Empkbob William declares be will dismiss any army officer who violates his orders about dueling. Tbis will soon have the ?fleet of plaoing dueling among tbe lost arts so far as the Ger? man army is ooooeroed. In maki.*? his appointment? yestoeday Speaker Hendaraon of the House of Repre? sentative! did not give a single ch?irm?nsh ? toa southern member. To be sura mo?t o* the Southern members are dem?crata, but it would ?eem that at least ooe of the republi? cans in Congre?? from thii section might -a?? been honored. Mr. R. H Nash, a prominent citizen Of Balnsvil.e, Weetmorelind county, died suddenly yeeterday morning. The deceased was a deacon and treasurer of f opes Creek Baptist Church, ?od wm tt vetereo ex-Conlederste soldier. FROM WASHINGTON. [Ooro-aaaaodeni-a* of the Alexandria Oaaatta] Washington. December 11. Philippine tar.fi again engaged tbe attention ol tbe Hiu-e committee on wave ?nd means today. At tbe end of tbe ee-Mlon it ?as announced tbat tbe Payne tarif! bill outlined yeeterday will be reported witbout amendment to lb?? ?-use on Friday. It will be taken op for consideration Tuesday ami ?be pro? gramme flxee its passage for Wednes? day. Tbe bill will be opposed by tbe d?mocrate of tbe ways and means com? mittee wbo will submit a report de? nouncing it-* alleged underlying princi? ples of colonialism, imperialism and Dingleyism. In their opposition tbey will bave tbe support of Represen? five McCell, of Massachusetts, who finds in tbe bill the name objectionable principle that made b'.m attack tbe Porto Ricen fifteen per cent, measure. At ,today'a meeting of tbe com? mittee tbere wan no roll call, but tbe lines were silently drawn. A oommnnioation waa received from Secretary Treasury Gage advaoating ao amendment ao that tbere should be a drawback on goods made here of Im? ported materials equal to tbe amount of tbe duties originally paid on tbeee Imparts of raw material. The committee failed to ur>ie incorporate tbe amend? ment however and it may be urgi-d on tbe floor. The opposition of tbe repub? lican MoOaull ia cffeet by tbe support of tbe measure on tbe part of demo? cratic members from Louisiana, who believes it Is to be to the benefit of their rice and sugar interests. During the House recess until Friday tbe lour tboussnd aud more bills which bave been introduced already in the House will be distributed among tbe committees having in charge the subjects of whioh tbey treat. Tne President's message wili also be divided up, and under the resolution offered by Representative Payne be referred to the aeveral committees. Some meas? ures whioh are regarded as urgent may be reported hack to tbe House before tbe adjournment for tbe holiday??, but tbey will be but few, so that not a great deal of work will be accomplished un? til tbe House reassembles on January 6, further than the passage of tbe Phil? ippine tariti bill. Two or three days will suffice to get tbe measure through the House. Tbe meeting of tbe Senate committee on commerce will be held tomorrow to organize and to begin tbe consideration of Senator Frye's ship subsidy bill. William Loeb, jr., personal aeoretaty of President Roosevelt, has gone to Albany, N. Y., wbere be will be mar? ried at noon tomorrow to Mies Kath? erine W. Dorr. The wedding will be a very quiet one, only a family party at? tending. After a briel visit to New York city, Mr, and Mrs. Loeb will re? turn to Washington and be domiciled ?t tbe Richmond. All the members of the President's family have selected presents for tbe young couple for Mr. Loeb is a great favorite io tbe Presi? dent'? borne circle. If recent news received from Nica? ragua is true, to tbe efiecl tbat tbe gov? ernment of tbat country bas wiped out ad concessione which would interfere with the plans of the United States to construct a canal across tbat territory, it will upset considerably the projects of tbe Maritime Canal Company. In regard to tbe ownership of the land through wbicb the inter-oceanic canal is to run, tbe company repeata its form? er claim that It actually owns, by right of purchase, every foot of the canal route between Lake Nicaragua acd the Paciflo Ocean. All of the lands that the Maritime Canal Company owns were bought for 150,000, and, lf it should ask speculative prices for i , H would be easy for tne United Slates and Nicaragua to bring condemnation proceedings and secure it at a fair figure. Tbe present Congress Is without a single negro member, and tbe prospect of one being elected in the near future, seems darker tbao it baa been at any time in tbe last third of a century. Witb tbe execution of a brief perioel, from 1887 to 1889, tbis is tbe first ses? sion of Congrees in thirty-two years witbout one or more colored men as members.
