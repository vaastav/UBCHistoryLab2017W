Robert W. Allison. who departed this life at 8 o'clock A. M., Tuesday, October 20, 1885. The deceased had boon afflicted with a painful illness for more than three years, and at times seemed to recover, but for the last few months she suffered most severely. According to her last sayings, we believe she has made her escape to a better world, where none but Christians dwell. She leaves tier husband with nine children and miany relatives and friends to mourn her departure, The funeral was largely attended. A IFRIEND. Everybody smokes Ingman's five-cent Manhatta.

Work was commenced this week upon the new levee to be constructed at Lacroix place, and there is a force of twenlty or thirty white men employed which is to be .cunsiderably increased. We wre some what misinformed relative to the awarding of the contract for this work. Mr. Martin ll.:ad is not t.e.contractor,but is merely in charge of the job as foreman or superiu tendont for Mr. Maginty, of the firm of Ja: mo' & MagiNut. The State Engineers have deemed it advisable to extend the new levee several hundred feet further below the caving batture than was at first .contemplated, giving the embankment a total length of 1750 feet, including the two wings connecting it with the old levee, which cover about 130 feet of the dis tance mentioned. We understand that Mr. Head expects to complete the work during the latter part of January or the beginning of February. The old levee is still intact, and in all probability will re main so dring the coming high water seasoin.

A., which was captured from that famous regiment in the Trans Mississippi Department during the civil war, is in the possession of an ex-Union soldier residing at Dana, Green county, Iowa. Among the surviving officers of the Sec ond Louisiana, a friend recalls Colonel W. G. Vincent, the well known auctioneer, New Orleans; Adjutant R. N. Sims, attor ney-at-law, Donaldsonville; Capt. Hiram H. Carver, attorney-at-law, Napoleonville; Capt. Allen Jumel, State Senator, Iberville; Lieut. Alex. Hebert, District Attorney, Iberville; Capt. M. Kenison, commanding steamer Warren ; Lieut. D. Webster Kelly, Grosse Tpte; Major W. W. Brazeale, Natchitoches; Capt. E. T. Lewis, ex-Con gressmpn, Opelousas; Capt. Dave Paul, Sheriff of Rapides parish; Capt. Jeff. Stafford, Alexandria; Capt. Gallion, Natchitoches ; Capt. W. F. Strong, ex Secretary of State; Capt. L. D. Prescott, newly appointed Postmaster at Washing ton, St. Landry parish. Measures have been taken by the gallant Colonel of the regiment to secure the re turn of its beloved colors, and all the old soldiers who marched under the war-worn banner will await its recovery with impa tient intgrest. EXECUTiVE GLEMENCY AND THE INCREASE OF CRIME. An examination of the official records in the office of the Secretary of State has been made by the Baton Rouge Cupitolian -Ad vocate with a view to ascertaining whether there is any just foundation for the charge that Gov. McEnery has contributed to the increase of crime by showing extraordinary and undue clemency towards convicted criminals. Our contemporary reports, as a result of this inquiry, that the number of convictions for criminal offenses under the McEnery Administration is double that at tained during the administration of Gov ernor Nicholls, whereas the percentage of commutations has been reduced by Gover nor McEnery from 28 to 20%. While the CHIEF confesses to a decided predilection against the present State Administration and this without regard to its political com plexion-we have not preferred or indorsed the accusation which seems to have been so successfully refuted by our esteemed Baton Rouge contemporary. Under existing laws it would be manifestly unjust to blame the Governor alone for commutations of crim inal sentences, since he can not exercise the executive prerogative in such cases until a majority of the Board of Pardons-which consists of the Lieutenant Governor, Attor ney General and the Judge who presided at the trial of the condemned-shall have rec ommended such action; and it is reasona ble to presume that a body so constituted would not advise interference with the ver dict of a jury without weighty reason. A Governor who declines to acquiesce in the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Pardons-and its conclusions are nearly always unanimous-would undoubtedly be oftener wrong than right, and much more likely to consig. a defenseless fellow crea ture to unmerited punishment than to in flict an injustice upon society by heeding the Board's advice. Though the records cited by the Capilo lian-Advocate effectually shield the Govern or from the charge of indiscriminate or un usual clemency, they apparently bear out the allegation that crime has increased un der his administration. If the " number of convictions for criminal offenses, as com pared with Governor Nicholls' administra tion, has been doubled," the presumption arises that the number of criminal offenses has increased in corresponding ratio. To successfully combat this presumption it will be necessary to show that juries, Judges and other officers of the law were much more lax in the discharge of their duties during the term of the Nicholls administra tion than has been the case under the Mc Enery regime. We scarcely believe that a task of this kind will be so much as at tempted. Good News of Good Things.

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS. The National Congress assembled in regular session, at Washington, last Mon day, with nearly all the members in attend ance. The Senate organized by electing Hon. John Sherman, of Ohio, nominee of the Republican caucus, as its presiding offi cer, the vote standing 34 for Sherman against 29 for Senator Harris, of Tennes see, nominee of the Democratic caucus. Senator Sherman's remarks in -assuming the chair were very brief, and included a touching allusion ,to the death of Vice President Hendricks. As soon as intelli gence of the organization of the House had been received and a joint committee ap pointed to notify the President, resolu tions relating to the demise of the late Vice President were adopted, and the Sen ate adjourned in respect to his memory. On Tuesday the President's message was received and read. and since then the Sen ate has been engaged in discussing Sena tor Hoar's presidential succession bill and the transaction of ordinary business. There will be little change in the forma tion of committees or subordinate officers of the Senate. In the House of Representatives I-on. John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, was re elected Speaker, receiving 177 votes, against 138 for Hon. Thoe. B. Reed, of Maine. On assuming the chair, Mr. Car lisle addressed the House as follows : Gentlemen of the House of Representa tives-In assuming the duties and respon sibilities of this place for a second time, I beg to return my most profound thanks for the manifestation of your continued confidence. It is a compliment which I shall always remember with pride and gratitude. Nowhere else in the world can there be found a legislative assembly representing so great a constituency as that represented by this House, and certainly no similar body, consisting of an equal number of members, is its superior in point of ability and devotion to the interests entrusted to it. The privilege of presiding over the do liberations of such a body is a very high and honorable distinction, the highest and most honorable it can confer on any of its members, and Iappreciate it as such, but, gentlemen, my full appreciation of your action to-day can best be shown by a con scientious and impartial discharge of my of ficial duty, and although it may not be wise to make pledges in advance, I venture to promise that to the fullest extent of my ability the law governing the proceeding of the House shall be evenly administered, with a view to the preservation of order and decorum, the protection of the person al and representatives rights of members and the prompt transaction of public business. None of these results, however. can be obtained withouf your active co operation and support. In a body so large as this, representing such vast and sometimes conflicting inter ests, a constant observance of established rules and precedents is imperatively re quired, not only by considerations vitally affecting the public welfare, but in order to maintain the honor and dignity of the House itself. In the sharp contests for priority which unavoidably occur in such a body the restraints imposed by the fixed rules are sometimes quite severely tested, especially if there has been a large accu mulation of business, but experience has shown that the necessity for order and regularity in the consideration of leiisla tive measures is so fully appreciated by gentlemen on the floor that they can al ways be relied upon to maintain the pre siding officer in every proper effort he may make to obtain that result. In view of this fact I feel much more confident of a reasonable degree of success in this trying position than would other wise be justifiable. Questions of order must be decided promptly, as they are raised, generally without much opportunity for deliberation and consequently whoever may occupy the chair and however careful he may be, mis takes must frequently be committed, but, fortunately, this house has, at all times, in its own hands the power to correct them and preserve the integrity and consistency of its practice, and I am sure, gentlemen, that you will not hesitate to exercise that power whenever the occasion may de mand. Gentlemen, we are about to enter upon the work of an important session. More important perhaps than any that has tre ceded it for many years. The political re lations heretofore existing between the two bodies of the House and the Executive De partment of the Government have been re versed and this, of itself, imposes new ob ligations and duties on both. Under a popular form of Government like ours a political change in the executive neccessarily involves altered methods of administration, inaugurates a new legisla tive policy,and consequently presents new questions for the consideration of the people and their representatives. It is probable therefore, that many questions not heretofore prominent in nor delibera tions will engage a large share of your at tention during the present Congress. It may be reasonably anticipated also, that wide differences of opinion will exist on many of these questions, resulting in long, earnest at d perhaps exciting contests on the floor and it may be that these differ ences will not always he defined by recog nized party lines. Under these circum stances, a proper appreciation of the integ rity and patriotism of each other, a sin cere respect for the honest opinions of op ponents in debate and the cultivation of a mutual forbearance will be neccessary to enable the House to conduct its precec dings with order and deliberation and avoid unpleasant incicents. which are always, in my experiencnat least, most seriously re gretted by those who participate in them. The house is the only custodian of its own peace and dignity, and without its cordial support no presiding officer can preserve either. And now, gentlemen, before taking the oath of office, allow me to renew the ex pressions of my sincere acknowledgment of the great honor you have conferred and the great trust you have confided to my hands. I accept both with a proper sense of the obligations they impose and certainly with the earnest desire to discharge these obligations without prejudice to any public interest. Nearly all the former officers of the House were re-elected; a committee ap pointed to notify the Senate and the presi dent of organization: the usual drawing for seats conducted; after which resolutions referring to the death of the Vice President were adopted and the House adjourned until Tuesday as a mark of respect to his mem ory. As in the Senate the greater portion of the second day's session was occupied in hearing the President's message, and the main topic of discussion since then has been a proposed revision of the rules which will make some highly important changes in the manner of conducting business, par ticularly with reference to appropriations. AC A M.D. To all who are suffering from the errors and indiscretions of youth, nervous weakness, early decay. loss of manhood. etc., I will send a recipe that will cure you.
