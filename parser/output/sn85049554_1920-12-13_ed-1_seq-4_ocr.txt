The monthly assizes were.in prog ress at the mining can*p of lHowlinfr Wfllf. and the coui house was crowded with a motley throng, who .took a deep, if sqmewhat noisy, in terest in all the proeeeilings. The Uproar got worse and worse, and at last the, judgo could bear it .no Jonger. An imposing figure, he .arose to his feet and tallowed out: "Gontlemen, and aluo prisoney, I must' insist on order in the court house.

THE ASSOCIATED VMKtNt CASES. Some principal schemers and pro moters of the Associated Packing Company are to be put oa trial uader criminal charges. The attorney general is reported to be looking toward penitentiary sentences for at least some «f, the men' responsible to the law? The Associated paoklng scandal is too £(|Ssh in the public mind to need explanation or comment.) It waup aired At length In court ana In public prints. The question which is now to be decided by the court Is whether or not1 the pramotkm and «ale of stocks of that character can he,conducted wrei lmthmtty frtmi the law. The in dividual proeecntlona ape by way In cidental to the settlement of the larger question.

Alfio, if there is any way of getting at the beaters and blfd dog* the de partment of Justice will confer a' lasttiag benefit on the state -by dis covering it. 7 A y.u.. .1 51HTE CONSTAKUUmr. "iA. bill is in the making for Intro duction into -the assembly provijUnj5 ior & state Cflxurtabul&ry of SfiO offl* oers -and privates, mounted on torses1 under the direction of the -goy erftor of the state. This bQdy wili aupeclpr pomsra and wi^ taot be amenable ,to local laws .and ordin •anoee if -the bill should Ohance to be come a Jaw. Jt Is estimated that the cost to the/state will not Ae less than ia half million dollars annually. As planned the constabulary will ..be maiigy in protection against robbers *»d yeggmen as the -outline -suggests that it will not be called upon to en force automobile laws, etc. Five troops are planned to be located In different -parts of the state. The bill is likely to meet -hard sledding in -the assembly. First or ganized labor will steadfastly oppose The expense connected with maintaining Ave troops of such a constabulary will have its effeot upon taxpayers who. already complain of burdensome taxation. Cities and city governments will not fall kindly intp line for a plan that supercedes local self government and finally there will arise in the minds of many some fears and ^conjectures as to the use fulness at such a force to a gover nor who should chance to be self serving and have political dehts to be paid to elements which demand license as the price of political sup port. Such governors are sometimes, elected and even re-elected, even in Iowa. HOUSTON'S UNWISE TAX PROPOSALS. Mr. Houston's reoommendatlons to oongress as to taxation will meet no approval from business men and tax* payers. He seems to have sought further complication of tax laws al ready too complicated. Xt has become necessary for corporations and even private Individuals to hire experts and Specialists to figure their taxes. Indeed when a government official haa beoome expert on income taxes and direct taxation he quits government service for better pay pay from heavy taxpayers. Houston's proposals are direct evi nce against the present system. In his report he shows that the big sur taxes up to 70 per cent can not be collected, jit falls down. Incomes of oVer 8800,(KK) paid |992,972,08fi in 1918. They paid $781,872,163 in 1817. Last year they paid only $892,847,828. The big Income makers had bought non taxable securities or taken other ways ovt The excess profits tax for 1820 brought about two billions. For 1928 Houston estimates it at about $800,. 000,000, a falling off of /one and one fifth billions. Conservatively capital l*kl corporations pay the tax. Over 'capitalised ones escape It The thing It wrong In theory and iniquitous in operation. lo ldesi was fever Aiore erroneous than that which obtains that the "rich p*y all tlie taxes." Everyone should know anil many who did not know are discovering that taxes and impo sitions are passed on wherever they snd that Is, In most instances, to the Jlml purchaser and consumer. Houston's proposition is not to slm pllfy the. system of taxation but to further complicate it lie wants to ever»*thing. His proposal as to Income taxes would place heavier im positions on Income spent for living. His plan of Imposts on all manner of commodities means ^greater annoy a*c* 4« the public.. He does not favor sales tax but Jt is not easy to ees the vital difference between a soles tW.taid by the government and one laid by the seller, unless the differ ence is in fayqr of the seller.^ *»5a on-' men yeggmen gftnised why -mount the horses to cope with equipped with the fastest automobiles driven by expert chaffeurs? Of course it would look military and fine but while a motorcycle is not 4. thing of beauty or quiet it gets there Just the same. A troop of consta bulary pn horseback chasing a gang of yeggs in a car geared s.to ninety miles would be not only pitiful but ridiculous. However it is a long way between a bill for a state constabulary of 300 men and the actual fact and. organi zation of such a force., The Invention of the magic lantern is ascribed to Roger Bacon about IZ6D. 4k early.

IOWA OPINIONS AND NOT Eg, "Senator Qapper purposes to legis late out of existence wire houses, bucket shops, blackboards, and gambling in gi-ain, 'cotton, pork, etc. Camper's idea is to help the farmer. The writer saw a little vof this work once at short range and the farmers elevators were the first to come to the irescue of the wire houses," as serts the Iowa Falls Citizen.

The Storm Lake Pilot Tribune sees "one good sign in Uix legislation in reqent years. Legislators are .getting farther away every year from exces •sive property taxes and are levying heavier- income and inheritance taxes. It is right that those who can afford ty shall Day the taxes, and it is also right that those .who inherit proper ty earned by the efforts of some one else shall pay part of it to the .state.

The Waterloo Times-Tribune says: "Setting ailde his expression In favor of democratic measures of relief for the good of the workl, as well as this country, the president's message Is a pure business document. He believes congress should ihake the most of this short session. Mr. Harding cites the delays by congress in the past, and suggests- the same thing. With the two leaders making such re quests, It Is hoped that congress will get down to business." /owa Newspapers .4^
