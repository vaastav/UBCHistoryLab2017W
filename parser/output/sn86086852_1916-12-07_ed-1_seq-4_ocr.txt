Crawford ROBERT M. CRAWFORD. EDITOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER T. 1916 National Committeeman Joseph Mar tin is reported as favoring the nomina tion by the Democrats of Edward Nordman for speaker of the assembly. Everybody knows that Mr Nordman stands squarely for the Democratic national and state platforms; and his work as a lawmaker has been good. He is clearly the logical candidate. THE MESSAGE. On page four of this paper appears the message delivered by President Wilson to congress on Tuesday. It is less than three columns in length. It is like all the Wilson messages: plain, short, and to the point. It asks for more governmental control over rail ways and their operation; for greater freedom of combination for those en gaged in promoting foreign commerce; for an amendment to the organic law of Porto Rico: and for the passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elections. This administra tion has been so fruitful of good results that the country will look hopefully forward to the accomplishment of the desirable achievements outlined in the message. Sharper than a serpent’s tooth is the ungrateful editor of The American Economist, who blames Charles E. Hughes and his campaign managers for not waging their whole campaign upon the protective tariff issue. Judge Hughes is a man of great mentality, even if he did appear to a disadvantage in the campaign. It must have been distasteful to him to talk protective tariff nonsense at all, let alone making it the burden of his song. THE 

MILWAUKEE JOURNAL. Avery interesting newspaper of wide circulation and an able and good news paper, too, is The Milwaukee Journal. It prints the big things in current news; and explains them in masterful manner. The Sunday Journal is the crowning issue of the week. It is truly “the Sun day newspaper of the matchless news service.” It is markedly superior to any Sunday newspaper published in Chicago or any where else outside of New York. It is indeed a great news paper. While the makers of The Milwaukee Journal can be truly said to walk with tiie kings of newspaperdom, they have not lost the common touch. That is what makes their newspaper so in tensely interesting to all. and so helpful to all. It is absolutely independent; with a great gift of interpreting in a spirit of true democracy new issues as they arise; and with the daring alac rity fo take the right side of a great cause at the right time. Because of these qualities it has attained leader ship. The Journal stands in the foremost rank of newspapers supporting Presi dent Wilson. In the campaign lately closed, while some other great inde pendent newspapers which came around all right in the end were mak ing a virtue of open mindedness, The Journal was striking hard blows at the combined forces of reaction and dis loyalty. There is a man of wonderful discern ment over at Menomonee Falls. He can discern things that never happened. He is C. W. Fraser, secretary of the Republican state central committee; and he has written a letter to The American Economist saying that Wis consin was saved to the Republicans because of the 'continued pounding of the protective policy. It is very plain indeed that foreign influences alone kept Wisconsin from going for Wilson and Williams. Mr Fraser evidently learned his political economy from the American Protective Tariff League, and really believes it. Poor man! Burlington Standard Democrat: Well, we do tivst worry if the democrats do not control the next house of representatives. On every meas ure that President Wilson recommended, there were from forty to seventy progressively inclin ed republicans supporting it and they will do so again, and we have the senate by at least twelve votes. Republicans in the senate are stiff necked. but in the house they are afraid to op pose progressive measures. Experts on Food Production. New York World: Farmers may not be qualified as experts in food dis tribution, but they know something about its production. When |the3 T say, through their Grange, that “an embargo ©n wheat and other • cereals [would [in the long run mean decreased [acreage” they state a fact, and one not without its bearing upon future problems of food at home and trade abroad. ■ nS f Declares That Their Opera tion Should Not Be Stopped or Interrupted by the Con certed Action of Organized Bodies of Men Until a Pub lic Investigation Shall Have Been Instituted. IN one of the shortest messages ever sent to congress President Wilson urges that early action be taken to complete his pro gram of “settlement and regulation” recommended at the last session. The message in full is as follows; Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the constitution of communicating to you from time io 1 time Information of the state of the | Union and recommending to your con | sideration such legislative measures as ; may be judged necessary and expedi ent I shall continue the practice, which I hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine my self to those matters of more general public policy with 'which it seems nec essary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make ray sug gestions as few as possible. But there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public to do at once. The Railroad Problem. In the first place, it seems to me im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settlement and regulation which I had occasion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the public dan gers disclosed by the unaccommodated difficulties which then existed and which still unhappily continue to ex ist between the railroads of the coun try and their locomotive engineers, conductors and trainmen. I then recommended: First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In the bill recently passed by the house of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate in order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various du ties now devolving upon it with a promptness and thoroughness which are, with its present constitution and means of action, practically impossible. Second, the establishment of an eight hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages in the employment of all railway employees who are ac tually engaged in the work of operat ing trains in interstate transportation. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe the actual re sults in experience of the adoption of the eight hour day in railway transpor tation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the in terstate commerce commission of an increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by rlie adoption of the eight hour day and which have not been off set by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed justify the increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation and arbitration „nf such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, in case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation of the merits of even* such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. Control by the Executive. And, sixth, the lodgment in the hands of the executive of the power, in case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railways of the coun try as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use. The second and third of these rec ommendations the congress immediate ly acted on: It established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work aud wages in train service and it au thorized the appointment of a commis sion to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most immediately needed, but it postponed action upon the other sug gestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate consider ation of them. The fourth recommendation I do not deem it necessary to renew. The pow- THE 

DEMOCRAT, MINERAL POINT, WISCONSIN. ik i m in in 0 r O OPERATION OF RAILWAYS SHALL NOT BE STOPPED To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual work man to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society in doing so would be to adopt a new principle into our jurispru dence which I take it for grant ed we are not prepared to intro duce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by the concerted ac tion of organized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at is sue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the concerted ac tion of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial processes of the na tion. O. O er of the interstate commerce commis sion to grant an increase of rates on the ground referred to is indisputably clear, and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the commission’s authority or its inclination to do justice when there is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions—the increase in the interstate commerce commis sion’s membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity—l now very earnestly renew. New Legislation Necessary. The necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing. Those who have Intrusted ns with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them in such matters would find it hard, 1 believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any Unnecessary postponement of action. Not only does the interstate com merce commission now find it practical ly impossible, with its present member ship and organization, to perform its great functions promptly and thorough ly, but it is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as gn administrative instrument. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbi tration and conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be ho doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of Its items, the increase in the efficiency of the interstate commerce commission, the house of representatives has al ready acted. Its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. To Safeguard Industrial Processes. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupa tion should he obliged by law to con tinue in an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or pre vented the individual workman to leave his work before receiving the approval of society in doing so would he to adopt anew principle into onr juris prudence which I take it for granted we are not prepared to introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by the concert ed action of organized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the concerted action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial pro cesses of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportu nity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between employee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to consider all practi cable means of conciliation or arbitra tion. I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbitrary or unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupulous re gard for the interests and liberties of all concerned as well as for the per manent interests of society itself. Three matters of capital importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives—the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in pro lit Urges the Passage of the Corrupt Practices Act Reg ulating the Expenditure of Mom y In Elections and Fa vors More Freedom of Com bination to Those Engaged In Foreign Commerce. moting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly, the bill amend ing the present organic law of Porto Rico and the bill proposing a more thorough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, commonly called the corrupt practices act. I need not labor my advice tbai these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies in the manifest cir cumstances which render their adop tion at this time not only opportune but necessary. Even delay would se riously jeopard the interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg ulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less neces sary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer, because at least two years will elapse before another election in which fed eral offices are to be tilled, but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience. And a delay would have the further serious disadvantage of postponing action un til another election was at hand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. Enlarging Our Export Trade. • I shall not argue at length the de sirability of giving a freer hand in the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume. 

REGULATE EXPENDITURE OF ELECTION MONEY Immediate passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less necessary than the imme diate enactment of the other measures to which I refer, be cause at least two years will elapse before another election in which federal offices are to be filled, but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the present method of obtaining and spend ing campaign funds stand clear under recent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience. has indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented in onr experience. We have not the necessary instrumen talities for its prosecution. It is deem ed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale un der onr present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesi tate or delay. I The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law o<‘ Porto Rico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily remove. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once. s Legislative Annals Enriched. ‘ There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you in the many measures of constructive policy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor in such company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare serviceableness and distinction.
