Editor, Congressman Laird, of Nebraska, has introduced a bill to establish experi mental stations to devlop silk and sugar industry in that state. The Abiline Gazette says a Kansas man has invented a patent cork -extractor, and asks to what purpose that article will be devoted? "We give it up. The dispatches announce heavy snow storms north and soutli of Kansas, the heaviest in Texas for years, while through this section the finest, pleasantest, sun niest weather imaginable is still with us. The Topeka pension agency is the third in the amount of disbursements. For the year ending June 30 it paid out f J,8o0,951.73 at an expense of $2.26 per $1,000. which is the least of the eighteen agencies. , Mr. Samuel Spencer has been elected prcsident.of the B. & O. at a salary of $2o,000 per annum. The salary of Rob ert Garrett was only $4,000. This dis crepancy against Mr. Garrett is said to have been the real cause of his recent mental depression.

Secretary Fairchild suggest to " con gress, as an amendment to the immigra tion law, that a fine be imposed upon the master of a vessel for every alien brought to this country who is liable to Income a public charge, and that the fine be made a lien upon the ve&sel. Senator Chandler seems to think a free vote, in the south, of more concern to the country tfian free trade. The sena tor's conclusions are correct, though we do not agree with him fully as to methods to accomplish the purpose as set out in the bill he introduced in the senate. "Wichita is green with envy because a Chinaman dropped died in St. Joe the other day. Garden City Herald. Yes, and if our little neighbor to the west had two or three hundred almond eyed orientals as "Wichita has it would be in no humor to be joking about it, either. An "experienced observer" says the unprecedented drouth experienced in certain sections of the country this year will result in the total extermination of the chinch bugs. The same result fol lowed the drouth of 1858, and for six years thereafter there were no bugs in the dry sectious. This will be welcome news to the farmer. Mr. Edward Atkiiibou's scheme of annexation, as iar as Nova Scotia is concerned, came near being blown into emithereens, together with a considerable portion of the island jiy the premature explosion of gun cotton in the fort at Halifax a day or two ago. It is alleged to have been done by a disgruntled yankee fisherman. The one vote that Omaha received in the national committee when locating the place for holding the next Republi can National convention seems to have bet her neighbor and rival. Lincoln, bj the ears. Lincoln serves notice on Omaha that next time she will be big enough and ready to take a hand in the content for the national Republican con vention. The manager of the Thomas Iron com pany, a large concern, is reported as saying: "Most of the steel rail mills will bhut down before Christinas. The demand was growing lighter and the president's message drives another nail in our coffin."' Up to December 1, he states, the association had orders for only 75,000 tons for next year, but not an order since. "We suggest to those public spirited statesmen at "Washington who are in clined to squnder an unlimited amount of public money in establishing a po.stal telegraph system that if a small iortion of the amount necessary for that enter prise were expended in increasing and improving the postal service throughout the country the pretext for-4he tele graph would be largely supplanted and the present harrassing and damaging condition removed. Better postal service is universally demanded, while very few care anything about the proposed gov ernment telegraph scheme.

If the Citizen had omitted mention of the mountain sides .and foot-hills in the foregoing one could hardly have mis taken it for a pen picture of "Wichita and its evironments so accurate a descriptive is it of this city, the tributarv country and the business situation and outlook. There seems to be little doubt that congress will take some action during the present session in the matter of open ing the Oklahoma country to settlement, but until some such action is taken it is idle to talk about moving into the coun try, no difference how great the num ber, and taking formal possession. Past experiences in that matter ought to be sufficient to convince every one that it cannot be done. The question of buck ing against the United States govern ment is a serious one. and one that can not l? done successfully. It has been tried repeatedly and has always failed: and it always will. We think Oklahoma ought to be opened by the government for settlement; we think congress will pass the necessary laws this winter: but until it docs' boomers had better keep out. 

NORTH OR SOUTH-WHICH? "Which is running this country just now the north or the south? The speaker of the popular branch of congress is a south erner, and so are the heads of his leading committees, who, in fact, formulate and fix legislation. A Calhoun man and a re habilitated rebel will be on the supreme bench. The presiding genus of the cabi net, who impresses his image upon our foreign policy, is a southern man. The head of the department of justice, who presides over the legal conscience of the government, is an ex-confederate brigadier general. The representatives of the re public at the leadintr courts of Europe used to train under the "stars and bars." The departments at Washington are crowded with southern "majahs" and "kernels'' and "judges." The civil service commission has a representative from South Carolina, who sits iii judgment on the claims of men for positions under the government who performed duty under the stars and stripes. The president writes a message, and the broad hands of Kentucky Carlisle and Texas Mills are discernible iii every line. "Which is in the saddle the north or the south? Omaha Republican. The Republican's statement of the case under consideration is true beyond controversy, but it might have gone a step farther and asked who is responsible for such a state of affairs? Without stopping to think the answer would be given by nine-tents of the readers of the statement quoted, jvhy, the south, of course.' Such, however, is not the case; that is the south is not wholly to blame for it. The people of that section have simply taken advantage of the opportuni ties afforded tlieni by the people" of the north, and mainly by Republicans. First, our people, we mean the peo ple of the north, because restive at the seeeming slowness of the government at paying off the national debt, notwith standing it was being done from the very first'as rapidly as the financial con dition of the country and its commercial interests would achnit, and the impatients flew off at a tangent and organized the Greenback move. Then the temperance people became dissatisfied at the slow progress that cause seemed to them to be making and because their demands for absolute, universal jirohibition were not complied with by the Republican party whicli had saved the Union and effected the liberation of six millions of human slaves, although it had given every assur ance in promise and pledge and act con sistent with its obligations to the whole people, we say because these require ments were not complied with in a jiffy very many excellent citizens and hitherto good Republican's suffered themselves to be led off and into the Prohibition camp. Other minor issues have been made use of to like purpose, and the result has been there could be but one result the weakening of the Republican party and relatively strengthening of the Demo cratic in the north until, added to its allies in the south who have never suf fered from any such dissentions and sloughing off, that party succeeded in gaining control of the government, and being in a position to enforce its demands for place, and being entitled to the lion's share, as for that, by reason of its indis pensible assistance in securing such con trol, it could hardly be otherwise than as it is today. So. then, while the Republican party as such is in no way to blame for the state of affairs complained of, individual members of the party are responsible for it, and the most serious, not to say ag gravating feature of the situation is that man' of those who aie responsible for the party's reverses refuse to learn anything from experience, but persist in their course. The outlook for success to the Republican paity was never more auspicious, in view of the Democratic faux pas on the tariff question than at present, and if those who have hitherto brought about its defeat by the course of action indicated would stop their non sensical endeavors and renew allegiance to the party the enenvy could and would be speedily routed, horse, foot and dragoon, and the humiliating spectacle which now tantalizes the loyal people of the north removed and the govern ment, in the heads of departments at least. 1)C placed in the hands of friends of the Union. 

REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVEN TIONS. Of the eight Republican national con ventions so far held Chicago has had four. Philadelphia two, Cincinnati one, and Baltimore one. At this time the dates on which these conventions have been held, and the presidential nominee selected at each, are matters of interest. It will be noticed that the convention of next year will be held at a later date than any that have preceded U: Dite. I'l.icp. lVB-Junc IT... .Philadelphia. Xoinlncc. .....T. C. Fiomont. ... A.

Butler, of South Carolina, requiring railroad conductors to procure a license before they shall be employed in that capacity, strikes us as a little incon gruous wherein it provides that "no license shall bo granted to anyone to act as railway conductor who lias not had one year's experience as a railway con ductor."' Of course the men now in services as conductors are all right, pro vided they possess the qualifications prescribed in the proposed bill, but when they are gone where will their successors come from? Under the law if enacted as proposed a man cannot act as conductor without a license, and he cannot get a license unless he has served as conductor at least one year. The originator of the proposed law probably got his idea from the Tennessee board of magistrates who ordered a new court house erected on the site of the old one and that the old one bo occupied until the new one was finished. When a book-keeper of a bank can carry on a system of pilfering for twent -five ears, a is imported from Philadel phia, it is clear that others connected with the institution are particojte erhiri-nis,-uf not by collusion at least through neglect of duty. Such transgressions indicate a very loose way of doing busi ness, such as will account for almost every such defalcation that occurs. President Foster, of the New York Re publican club, in his address before the convention of Republican clubs in New York city, enunciated two ideas which tliat meeting may well make cardinal doctrines as A basis of campaigning for next year and for all time, i. e. the elim ination of personal mud throwing and the saloon influence from the politics of the country. There is no denying that these two influences have been most po tent in determing the results of elections from president down, and it is high time that the good people of the country with out regard to party affiliations should put the seal of condemnation on such practices. The country lias suffered enough, is suffering every day, from the pernicious effects of such influences. The tendency is to deter the best man, often, from standing for election to official posi tion. These things coupled with the use of money in elections have partially nul lified the elective franchise and placed the best interests of the country in jeo pardy. We believe the sentiment of a long suffering people will endorse Mr. Foster's suggestions and that they will be sustained if formulated into measures of practical application. The Eagle heart ilv desireto see it done. In commenting upon the proposition of Senator Raines to dispose of the sur plus by paying to the government pen sioners the present value of their pen sions, computed on the average expect ancy of tjieir lives, the Lawrence Jour nal says: "The plan would afford only temporary relief. It would flood the country with a surplus of money for a season, to be . followed by the stoppage of quarterly disbursements of many mil lions iu the payment of pensions. In a large proportion of cases it would be a detriment to the pensioner. The money would be unwisely expended, and the re sult would be hopeless want to many of them. To the country at large, it would J be a flood, followed by a drouth; an emptying of the reservoir, and closing ol the hydrants.' If the demands of the people in the matter of reducing the sur plus by lowering or removing the rev enue taxes are complied with there will not, or should not, be any great surplus after meeting fair and reasonable de mands on current pension account, a ju dicious expenditure for public improve ments and for the national defenses. Louisville held her municipal election a few days ago and the result was a black eye to the administration and a blow under the belt of Mr. Henri Wat terson, the great southern free trade statesman. The campaign was the most exerting of any that has occurred in that city for years. Ex-Mayor Jacob, run ning as an independent Democrat was elected over Avery, Republican, and Hoke, the pronounced administration candidate and "pot walloper" of Mr. Watterson's Courier-Journal. Jacob re ceived o.23" more votes than Avery and 7,78:5 more than the administration and Watterson man, a clear majority over both of 2, GOO. It is said that since the election Brother Watterson has become an intense attendant upon .Brother Moody's evangelical ministrations, while Farmer Hoke finds hitherto unknown delights in tending the stock on his plantation. , The purchase of the Abilene Gazette by the syndicate of Democrais headed by Geo. W. Glickand the making of that paper the party organ of the state is a terrific slap in the face of Brother Tom linson. of Topeka. and although it was brought about mainly, no doubt, b- the persistent opposition of the Topeka Dem ocrat to the line of polic' pursued by the administration wing of the party in this state, it is nevertheless true the Topeka paper has many friends and supporters in its part- in Kansas, and this new move, instead of harmonizing the factions in the party that have grown up on this ad ministration question, it will have the effect to intensify the feeling and widen the breach. However, the only effect it will hlive upon the Republicans will be to afford them harmless amusement. There is no danger to them one way or the other. There has recently been organized the United States Postal Improvement asso ciation. Its president is Win. Peim Nixon, of the Chicago Inter Ocean. Its objects are set forth in the following ex tract from the constitution which has been adopted . A reduction in the postage on seeds, bulbs, plants and coins. A re-issue of fractional currency, for use in the mails. Abolition of the present unsafe and in convenient postal notes. Provision for the issuance of postal money orders in sums of 5 or less for a fee of three cents. Any other proper measures designed to enhance the usefulness of the postal sei ice without too much expense to the government. 

WINTER WHEAT PROSPECTS. There is probably no authority consid ered more reliable on the subject of the wheat crop than S. T. K. Prime, of Dwight, 111., and his summing-up of the situation on Nov. 2-lth is given below in the shape of a letter from him to the Chicago Daily Business. Mr. Prime says: As to the general condition of the win ter wheat crop, it starts out with an aver age of 14 per cent lower than the crop of 1554, S per cent lower than the crop of 1555. 9 per cent lower than the crop of 1S8(5. 6 per cent lower than the crop of 1SS7. The main features of the outlook are these: First, entire absence of reserves of moisture; weakly condition of plants, growing up spindling instead of stool mg out. presence of Hessian fiy and chinch bugs, and near proximity to freezing weather. I will just run over the country, taking the facts from my morning reports-, commencing on the Pacific slope with California, under the mail date as late 3S the 17th inst. The fallowed land have all been sown on well cultivated IetK and await the fall and winter rains, of which so far a yet we have had none. Working eastward into the state of Kansas, while the coun trv there is drv, the state as a whole uow i,..r nu in hi siitfHrine- a.s the areas in the winter wheat belt east and southeast of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. The general tone from the Missouri is to the effect thai tlie months of September and Ootolier have been -ery dry. and that thty are needing rain badly, but thecmD seems to be resisting this unprecedented condition of things in a manner which, we might hardly expect while such a de ficiency of moisture exists in the Mis souri valley. We come now to Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana: The condi tion in one state is almost identical with that of another. I have today very full reports from Kentucky, which say that farmers today are complaining more now about the drouth than they did any time durine: J:he past summer. " Many cleaned out then: pools and ponds during the fall with the expectation of their being re plenished by rains, but none as yet have come. The" early sown wheat came up well and looked well until the continued drouth and appearance of the fly injured it considerably. Of the late sown wheat a great deal remains in the ground, not yet sprouted. Fall pastures, which al ways go towards wintering stock, have been, for the season at least, almost en tirely burned up. Crossing over the Ohio river, the coun ties bordering on it. as the papers have reported, have in the first place been terribly afflicted by forest fires, and the weather since ' last Sunday has been cold. The ground around the wheat is loose and the crop is suffering. Working eastward into In diana and over into Oliio the crop is good in streaks say one-third looks fairly well. The remainder is tmn ana has dried out and is to all appearances nearly lifeless. - The wheat sprouted, but we have not had enough moisture to keep it growing. Hence I would add that the majority of reports all speak so much of the spindling condition of the growing crop. I have no desire to in dulge in any speculations as tolhe ulti mate effect of the extreme surroundings which have followed the winter wheat crop from almost the date of seeding until the present time. It will be remembered that dry weather was the factor which did more to use up the winter wheat crop of 1883 than all the other causes combined. 

WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN WICHITA" To the Editor ot the Eaulc: The meeting of the Wichita E. S. A., held at the parlors of the Occidental hotel, yesterday afternoon, was the most successful and instructive of the series yet given. Many new members were enrolled and took active part in the pro ceedings. Mrs. E. M. Packer, as chair man, called the meeting to order, defined its objects and purposes and placed be fore the association the choice of the nominating committee for officers, name ly: Dr. Nannie Stephens, president; Mrs. Galloway, vice-president; T. B. M'Mcachan, secretary; Mrs. Judge Frid ay, treasurer. Dr. Stephens was con ducted to the chair by Mrs. Packer and Mrs. Lease; in an appropriate and heart felt address, the newly installed presi dent said: "That if intensity of pur pose, earnestness of conviction and will ingness to work for the principles of the cause which, with many, ranked next to God, would take the place of the ability she felt the position needed, she would accept the office, not as an honor, but as a trust and sacred duty." All were im pressed by the earnestness and ability of the gifted lady, and felt that a success ful era had dawned for the association under her regime. A vice-president will be chosen from each ward of the city at the next business meeting, which will be held in four weeks at the same place. The following subjects will albO be dis cussed at the next business meeting: "Why do we have two United States senators from each state ragardless of population?" "How manv supreme judges, how elected and for what length of time?' "How many members of the presi dent's cabinet, and what are their re spective duties?" "What is meant by tariff, and who does it benefit?"' iV'Is the right of franchise an inherent right or a political right and privilege?" 'Why were the women of Kansas given municipal suffrage and denied universal suffrage?"' The following persons will participate in the debate and discussion ot the above topics: President N. Stephens. Mesdames Packer, Priddy. Furlong, Stovall and Lease. The public, both men and wo men, arc cordially invited, as we hope ere the winter is bver to number among our active and honorary members our prospective governor, Hon. M. M. Mur doch, Father Casey and Dean Adams. In two weeks an open meeting will be held, at which a fine program will be rendeied and Hon. Rodolph Hatfield will give the address of the evening. The organization desires to return thanks to their accomplished hostess, Mrs. Cox, for donation ot Occidental parlors for meeting place. Respectfully, Con. E. S. A. 

POINTS WELL TAKEN. Laurence Journal. Senator Chandlers proposition to regu late the holding of congressional elec tions in South Carolina, Florida. Miss issippi and Louis'-na by placing them under the supervision of appointees of the president and of the federal circuit courts in,those states, both as to register ing and receiving of votes, and canvass ing letuins, is a measure of a very doubt ful policy. It is not denied that the con dition of" affairs in those states justifies federal interference, The injustice sought to be remedied is general, system atic, ojienly avowed and flagrant. In Louisiana the suppression of the colored vote is boastfully avowed and openly ad vocated by honored political leaders as a policy essential to the welfare of the state! It is also notorious that the sup pression of this vote has radically changed the political complexion of these states, giving the control of congress and the national administration to the party which is in the actual minority. Still experience lias shown that any out side interference, in conflict with preva lent, deep-seated prejudices, such as rule the governmg elements ot tnose states, not only fails in its purpose, but greatlT aggravates the evil intended to be reme died. The people of the state cannot le 1 successfully governed from the outside. Sn irliiV in-,fifv is on the side of Sena tor Chandler's measure, it is wiser to I work for the removal of the cause of ? the evil. On political questions that di- i vide the white vote, the colored vote will be not onlv tolerated but courted, as has been shown in Atlanta and wherever m the south a question has been at issue on which the white ote has been closely divided. It is wiser to trust to political issues to restore the suppressed colored vote than to attempt it by federal inter ference. A grand coyote hunt will take plac in Chicaskia township on next Saturday. About 500 men are exj-cted to iartici pate in the chase, and a day of exciting pleasure is expected. The chase will be governed bv old tore iinaung rules, tnai used to prevail in the states. A number I of inav hound and other dog-i have U-eu nrocurwl. and if a wolf is left m Chi caskia township after the hunt is over, Iw j will be in luck. The people of Chicaskia 1 are look-ing forwam io .-Nuumay wnrj many pleasant anticipations. Harpc-r 

EXCHANGE SHOTS-. You See it Depends. - Atchison Champion. Mr. Blaine is being severely criticised by the Democratic press for suggesting that a portion of the surplus be appro priated to the improvement bf our coast defenses, and yet Mr. Samuel J. Tilden made a similar recommendation which was lauded to the skies by the same journals. The Great Rephoimer. Kinsley Mercury. We observe that the report of the Pro hibition National committee includes an item of $1,000 "paid out for Gov. St. John's campaign expenses." The gen eral impression has been such expenses were borne bv the Democratic National Committee, in addition to a stipulated price per speech which was paid to the I great reiormer oy saiu organisation, Only a Sprinkling. Topeka Commonwealth. There is a "sprinkling" only of free traders in the Republican party. They do not exceed one in a hundred thousand of the mass of Republican voters. But they are now receiving great praises from Democratic sources for "rising above party." It may safely be said that a Republican is in a bad way when he is praised by Democrats tor departing irom Republican principles. The Kansas Way. Ell Perkins. The "boom" in Kansas comes from prohibition. Kansas used to send out $22,000,000 a year for whisky and beer. It is not sending out over $4,000,000 a year now. The Saving of $18,000,000 a vear by Kansas is making a surplus for the people and reducing the surplus of the United States. There will be no panic. The railroad building has peo pled the west with nev people who bring money. State Insurance Department. Atchison Champion. The state insurance department, under Commissioner D. W. Wilder, is in the best shape it has been for years. Its affairs are looked after personalh by Mr. Wilder. Special and scrupulous care is being constantly exercised to guard the rights and interests of the citizens of Kansas against insurance frauds, and with a vigilance most commendable and a conscientious regard for the obligations of his responsible position. General Wilder is separating Ue chaff from the wheat, and putting the business of his department on a basis that reflects great credit upon himself and the state of Kansas, whose faithful servant he is. State Bar Meet. The program for the Kansas State Bar association's annual meeting at Topeka the second Tuesday in January has just been perfected as follows: Opening ad dress by Judge Thacher, of Lawrence, president of the association; "The Dra matic side of the Jury Svstem." Judge Hubbard, of Iola: "The Veto, Its Use and Abuse," C. W. Smith, of Stockton: Taking the Case From the Jury," the Hon. J. W. Ady, of Newton: "Federal Jurisdiotion." Col. W. H. Rossington. of Topeka; 'Punishment. Degree and Measure," by Scott Hopkins, of Holton. In addition to the foregoing two mem bers of the association will be appointed to discuss the subject of each paper named. Let Him Come. Topeka Capital. The Capital enjoyed a most pleasant call last evening from Mr. R. M. Field, of the Kansas City Times. Mr. Field is enjoying a brief vacation from editorial work, and is making a tour of the prin cipal cities of Kansas for the purpose of making the acquaintance of the people and noting the progress and advance ment of the state. He is the brightest paragrapher in the west, his work having made the editorial columns of the Times sparkle with his fascinating humorous squibs. Mr. Field is a very genial gen tleman, whose friends are numbered by scores in Kansas. He leaves tomorrow for Newton, Wichita and Hutchinson. Evidence of Bad Citizenship. From the Chicago Journal. There is something almost inexplicable in the reluctance with which some other wise reasonable men consent to perform public duty, however biiei the time le required. " They shrink from jury duty, from political dutj , or from any other duty that calls them out of their offices, stores, factories or shops for a few hours each year, or sach decade of vears, as if they owed nothing to the community but every tiling to themselves. This is not good citizenship it is equal f o bad citizenship. It indicates a lack of linrrintism and of public spirit. It ind i-J eates a degree of indifference to the in terests of the public and of society that is only a degree short of treason. A Bright Prospect. Toledo Hlade. Let no Republican waste one word upon the eastern mugwumps. They are freo traders, almost to the last man. Their feeling for Cleveland will now in crease almost to the point of idolatry. They will vote as he directs, and they are definitely lost to the Republicans. But the change in the situation gives us the certaintv of carrying New Jersey and Connecticut on the tariff issue, and New York also. The state, outside the city, is strongly Republican and protectionist. Now let the hundreds of thousands of wage workers in New York city and Brooklvn have demonstrated to them clearlv the fact that the striking down of the" tariff wall means lower wages, less work, dull times, stagnation, want and suffering, and the Empire state will roll uj) a majority for protection that will paralyze the president.
