London An event surpassing in far reaching importance the actual mili tary operations of the war came Sun day in the public announcement by the new Russian .Premier, Alexander Tre poff, that, by an agreement concluded in 1915 and subsequently adhered to by Italy, the allies definitely established Russia's right to Constantinople and the Straits. Simultaneously, with the fate of Bucharest still hanging in the balance. came the news that Russia was mak ing heroic efforts to turn the tide of events in Roumania, in addition to ex erting vigorous pressure against Von Falkenhayn in Moldavia, where the Rnssians have gained a footing at Kir libaba. ':'.--''' The new Russian effort was visible sputh of Bucharest in an important at-. tack on l ield Marshal Von Macken- sen's rear, which, according to the Russian official report, was accom panied by some success, the Germans and Bulgarians having been driven from Tzomana and Gostinari.' The Russians are also successfully applying pressure in uoorudia. These Russian attacks on the two extreme flanks of the central forces may change the complexion of the Roumanian campaign, as there is no indication as yet that the central pow ers have succeeded in cutting off any considerable portion of the Roumanian armies.

Sheridan, . Or. William H. Dins- more, of Sheridan, will lose his claim secured at the Colville land drawing last spring. Mr. Dinsmore sent his check for the first payment, which was due, and the government refused the check, demanding caBh. Mr. Dinsmore was not not fled until it was too late to deposit the required coin, and was informed he was out of the race. - The claim was an exceptionally fine one, adjoining cultivated land on two sides valued at $100 an acre, and Mr. Dinsmore feels the loss keenly. No announcement regarding Mr. Bonar Law's decision has been made. and there are seme doubts whether he will accept the heavy responsibility. If he declined, it is considered certain that the honor will fall to David Lloyd ueorge. The continuation of the coali tion cabinet, with some changes in its membership and the speeding up of the war management will be the policy in either event. The premier's decision to resign and advise the King to summon Andrew Bonar Law to form a cabinet was taken after a day of extraordinary po litical excitement and activity.
