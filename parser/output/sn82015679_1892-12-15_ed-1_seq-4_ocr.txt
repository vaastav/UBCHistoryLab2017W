"Calamity Jim" Fhten has succeed ed in snoring himself out of tho face for fcpeaker of tho House, and if he should inore himself out of tho House tho State 70uld .be none the loser. The announcement of Chairman Tag 0art in Chicago that "tho Democracy of Indiana are a unit for ex-Governor Gray for a member of Mr. Cleveland's Cabinet,? is in tho natnro of news. The Chicago Inter Ocean has an edi torial on "How to Secure Clean Streets." TTho way to have clean streets is to clean them, but tho city authorities of Indianapolis do not beliovo in that Jnethod. . Oxe of Mr. Cleveland's friends an nounces that tho Cabinot positions will )e filled by tho men best qualified, re gardless of the desires of localities. If this is tho case, a largo number ot, can didates should prudently retire. ) The Democratic party is now en gaged in trying to analyze the relations t)etweeix President-elect Cleveland and the Chicago platform, with a view of as certaining what part of the platform ho fiiood on and what part he stood off. It Is an indication of returning sense that the Georgia Uouso tabled the State-toank-of-issue bill, Tuesday, by a vote of two to one. There is reason to be lieve that it is one of the planks of the Chicago platform to which the Democ racy will not live up. The statement of the Chicago Times that "the pension roll is made up largely of men who did no real service and whose term of enlistment was light," is disproved by tho records, which showed, a little over a year ago, that the average term of service of the men whose names ore on the pension rolls was over two Jears. ' . Dn. Jenkins, he of the Now York Health Board, who considered himself, a bigger man than President Harrison when the latter ordered a quarantine, last summerJenkins says that "to stop immigration for a period of one year would bo an outrage and a disgrace to an enlightened nation." Whatever Jenkins may think about such matters, ho should remember that ho is not hired to regulate the universe, much less the United States, but to look after the san itation of New York city; also, that it snakes no difFerenco to tho country what he thinks. .... .. . I If the next Congress, or any Congress, vrcre really anxious to economize, that bodjf itself would be a good place to be gin. .The expenses of Congress are fully CO per cent, more than they should be. And perhaps double. The appropri ation bill shows that the total amount to bo expended during the current fiscal year on the Senate account is $1,01S, 'tii.VO, and 

$2,S31.30C.SO on the House cccount The pay-rolls of both houses are enormously large, and the per quisites of members are numerous and costly. Both houses have a small army pf high-aalaried employes, who, though paid by tho year, work only one year in two, since they are only employed during the sessions of Congress. Senators are shaved, oiled and perfumed by "skilled laborers'1 paid by Uoclo Sam, and each Senator has a clerk and a private room, elegantly furnished, for his personal use. These rooms, which are either in tho Capitol or in an annex to the build ing, are fitted up in the most extrava gant style, with velvet carpet., real lace curtains, gold decorated Japanese screens of fino workmanship, modern library furniture, electric lighting ap paratus, marble clocks and general bric-a-brac that would make the averago American tax-payer open his eyes in as tonishment. These are only a few of the items that go to swell tho expense of the Senate, and tho House is not much behind. But it is part of tho business of Congress to keep these things concealed from the public, and however much it may economize, or pretend to economize, in other direc tions, thero is no probability that it will Hi due o its own expenses. Jcdgino from the expressions of Can adian newspapers the sentiment in favor of annexation to the United States is growing. The Brandon Sun, one of the leading papers of the Canadian North west, mentions a number of organiza tions and clubs which favor annexation, and says these do not embrace nearly all the persons who feel that a change ia the commercial policy of the country j Kz-zzzr.rj. "It the individual opm Izzi cl Ilcniioba regarding tha a- sirability of improved relations with the United States were ascertained," eays the Sun, "we venture to think it would be a great surprise to any who profess to believe thero are few who would be willing to alter their present political relations. That Canada can not go much longer on present lines scarcely ndmits a doubt." The Tilson burg Liberal "is fully convinced that Canada has hung on to the apron-strings of the old world long enough," while the St. John Telegraph is of the opinion that "the present relations between the mother country and Canada cannot bo long maintained." The St. John Globe predicts that "in a very short time this country Canada will bo alive with the fires of a new political agitation of a more sweeping character than any we have yet had," and tho Haldiraand Ad vocate exclaims, "Speed the day of po litical union with the United States." These papers have their readers and in fluence, and while they do not consti tute, by any means, a majority of the Canadian press, they show that tho an nexation sentiment is widespread and increasing. ,THE 

CASE OF EEV. DR. SJUTH. . Although tho decision of the Cincin nati Presbytery in the case of the Rev." Dr. Smith had been pretty clearly fore shadowed during tho trial, its announce ment will cause somewhat of a sensa tion in Presbyterian Church circles. After about nine months of contention and a trial lasting several weeks the. presbytery finds Dr. Smith guilty of heresy and suspends, him from the min istry "until such time as he shall make manifest to the satisfaction of the pres bytery his renunciation of the errors he has been found to hold, and his solemn purpose no longer. to teach or propagato them." There is in this decision and punishment an ex cathedra tone of in fallibility and intolerance that does not accord with tho spirit of tho nineteenth century, and which can hardly fail to set many ministers and members of tho Presbyterian Church wondcrwgwhether they are not heretics as well as Dr. Smith. There were three charges against Dr. Smith, with several specifications under each charge. The charges were based on certain teachings of his in two ar ticles published last spring in the New York Evangelist and in a pamphlet en titled "Biblical Scholarship and Inspira tion." Stripped of verbiage and boiled down, the charges and specifications wero all to tho point that Dr. Smith was guilty of heresy in denying tho verbal inspiration of the Bible and in sisting that many statements of the so called inspired writers were historically unreliable and scientifically incorrect. He did not deny nor in the slightest de gree impugn thesacrednesVand binding force of the Bible as a rule of faith and practice, but ho insisted that those por tions of it which did not relate to spirit ual life and conduct should bo Judged in the light ot reason, and that, being so judged, they disclosed errors of history and fact. Tho finding of the presby tery, in effect, asserts that every part of the Bible is equally inspired and in fallible, and that to attempt to bring any statement in it to tho test of his tory, science or reason is heresy. If this is heresy thero is reason to believe that many of the brightest men in the Presbyterian Church are tainted with it. The decision of the presbytery does not end the Smith case. It debars him from preaching until ho shall recant. but ho says he will not recant. That means that one of the ablest men "of the Presbyterian Church in the West will be excluded from the pulpit tem porarily, at least, and, perhaps, perma nently. Dr. Smith will appeal to the synod, which meets next October, and meantime will continuo to teach in Lane Seminary, but he cannot .preach. Tho action of tho presbytery savors strpngly of ecclesiastical intolerance ami bigotry. . THE PBE3IDE5T ASP THE NEW NAVY. A cynical critic once said of Mr. Ed munds that he ''could see a fly on a barn door without seeing the door." Some thing of this hypercritical faculty is evidenced in the Indianapolis News. The President's message seems to have thrown the News into a stato of mind. Its latest manifestation and outgiving is because of what the President said inspecting the navy nnder the adminis tration of Secretary Traoy, and it im pliedly charges that the President ignored-altogether what had been done during the previous administration, ar rogating to this ono the full credit for the cntiro new navy this especiaUy be cause of his expressed hope that tho good work that had been begun and con tinued might, in view of the November result, be not now "stayed." - The first observation to occur to a candid person is that President Harri son's message distinctly stated that it was a review of the four years, or of so much of that period as had elapsed of the present administration, having noth ing to do, cither directly or indirectly, with work performed under previous administrations. Secondly, that id ex pressing the hopo that tho work on the new navy would not "bo stayed," the President had an eye simply to tho well known fact that whatever objection to the new navy there was has com from Democratic members of Congress, and that work was quito likely to bo "stayed" by the new administration after it should come into full power, if the theories of economy advocated by its leading members in Congress and by its principal newspapers were to be actually carried out. The now navy, so called, began with the Forty--Ighth Congress, under a Re publican administration, when Senator Chandler was the Secretary, and prog ress in its development has been stead ily continued since; but the figures the News gives as between the Cleveland administration and the Harrison admin istration are misleading, if not incorrect. The ofiicial records show the following: During the Cleveland administration, as represented by the Forty-ninth and Fiftieth Congresses, there was appro priated a total of 

$2G,G3S.SC2, or, as the News puts it, that amount of money "was made available." By the Fifty first Congress end the first session of the Fifty-second Congress, during tho Har rison administration, there wero mado available 35,909,000. of which $2G.47V 000 was appropriated by the Fifty first, or the Republican Congress. The new vessels authorized from 1SS3 to 1889 aggregated C7.163 tons; between tho years 1689 and 1893 the vessels author ized aggregated Cu.ClG tons. The num ber of vessels under the Cleveland ad ministration was larger than under tho Harrison administration, but the ton nage is practically the same. The new vessels upon which work was begun un der tho Cleveland administration ag gregated 54,814 tons; under the Harrison administration, 109,018. The vessels commissioned during the Cleveland ad ministration aggregated 7,863 tons; dur ing the Harrison administration, 54,802 tons. The tonnage of the vessels upon which work was actually done in the Cleveland administration aggregated 09,197 tons; under tho Harrison adminis tration. 160,504 tons. This is the way the figures look in a table: S3 . 32. 5 i In o H. 2 a Years. 5 .si ft. t t 1885-9.... 1883-93.. f2G,658,3C2 C7.18C 34,814 7.863 64.832 60,197 169,564 35,903,X)C C3.C16I10S.C18 In view of theso figures, the littleness of the criticism of the Nows will be ap parent. President Harrison, in his message to Congress, neither desired nor intended to unduly aggrandize this administration in its work relating to the now navy, but simply presented the facts. He might well have said more than he did. . . 

PSACTICAL BEHEV0LEU0E. Mr. P. D. Armour, of Chicago, has long been known to his friends as a man of practical benevolence who has made many investments where the only re turns to himself were the satisfaction of doing kind acts and the pleasure arising from contemplation of the con sequent prosperity and comfort of fellow-creatures whom he had aided the highest form of pleasure, according to excellent authority. In many cases this benevolence, always modest and unob trusive, has taken the form of . assist ing young men to help them selves, ; and it is probable that his intercourse with young men out of employment has convinced him of the advantages of an education which will fit a boy for some profitable occupa tion at the saino time that it gives him intellectual training. As conditions are now, the majority of boys leavo school at an early age, owing to tho necessity of fitting .themselves for business. With a chance for doing this while they were in school a largo number of them would remain longer and could well afford to do so, for the manual skill or .technical knowledge they would have acquired at the ago of eighteen would qualify them for better positions than they would be likely to command through their independent exertions by that time. And the addi tional "book knowledge" that a boy gains between tho ages of fourteen and eighteen literary studies as well as mechanics and aits being a part of the curriculum of manual training schools is necessarily of great value to him. It is because of the time required to fit young men for business that so many are unable to spend more years iu school, and it is the lack of practical knowledge which he can put to immedi ate and profitable use that places the college graduate at so great a disad vantage. The benefits that will accrue to the people of Chicago from the institution so liberally endowed by Mr. Armour are likely to exceed in valuo all they will derive from the world's fair, great as are their expectations in this line. They are fortunate, indeed, in having among them a citizen who combines with his wealth and public spirit the good judg ment which enables him to bestow a gift that will be of sorvice to the great est number. If th'.s country is saved from disaster, its morals must do the work! The cities, we all know, are troveminjr us.

He is doubtless a non partisan, but ho docs not fail to under stand ono of tho sources of that "moral uprising" which mado Illinois and New York Democratic. He speaks of it as a thing which every one must know; still, there are a limited number of excellent gentlemen who have visions of a "new Democracy" in the late election. When they cease to consult their imaginations and consult facts, they will find that the "now Democracy," as a new party with a new purpose, does not exist.

While Mr. Cleveland carried New York by 42,000 plurality he did not re ceivo as many votes in forty-two of tho sixty counties in tho Stato as he did in 1SS8.

Evt.ry citizen of Indianapolis who is not familiar with the peculiar methods ot the officials who control the police foroe must be surprised that the patrolmen who insult ed Mr. J.

They are of the same ilk as two patrolmen in that same locality to whom complaint was made tbat there was unseemlnaly shooting in a saloon; they denied it, and told the would-be complainant that 'if be should make a complaint at headquarters it would be of no use, as they would testify against him." In other cities, or, rather, nnder other police management, there would be an inquiry to ascertain why four or five patrolmen were assembled at a little sta tion at midnight when they should be patrolling the streets.

Three Railway Presidents Argn In Favor of Permitting Trafflo Tools. Washington, Dec. 14. A number of prominent railroadmen, including Chaun cey M. Depew and President Koberts, of the Pennsylvania system, were before the Senate committee on interstate commerco this morning to advocate the passage of the amendment to the interstate-commerce law introduced by request by Mr. Cullom to modify the existing law so. as to author ize railroad companies to form pools under the supervision of the Interstate-commerce Commission, to wipe out the penal clause of the punishment prescribed, etc The full committee was present, and speeches were made by Mr.- Depow, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Walker and Mr. In galls, these gentle men urging that the great majority of the railroads of the country were in favor of the proposed amendment. President Roberts, of the Pennsylvania road, said that in his judgment the mter- state-commerce law bad not operated for the benefit of the publio in the matter of preventing discrimination. He said, in the course of his remarks, that he wanted to impress on the committee the fact that the law, as now drawn, precluding railroad companies from making arrangements in reference to tratlio agreements, induces radical violations of the law by the com panies and the shippers as well. The com panies were not violating the fifth section of the law (that preventing pooling), but in observing its provisions they were vio lating some other sections. Mr. Roberts did not think the commission should be allowed to regulate rates, because it was not in the interest of the publio that it should do so. Nor was the pooling system the best, but it was better for the publio than the practice now existing. Mr. Rob erts was of the opinion that it was of as muoh importance to the publio at large that the railroad companies should not be allowed to charge too low rates as it was that they should not be permitted to charge rates that were too high. Pooling might be authorized by Congress, subject to cancellation by tho commission if found to be unjust. Mr. Depew, president of the New York Central, said that the interstate-commeroe law had been established to prevent dis crimination; but its eilect had been to pro mote trusts beyond anything that had ever been dreamed of. There were eight roads between New York and Chicago, but for all the purposes of the publio there was but oue. If an iron-clad rule of equal rates under equal conditions of time was established the New York Central and the Pennsylvania would do eight-tenths of the business. The other roads would go into bankruptcy, with all the attendants of bankruptcy. In this way the law prevent ing pooling was creating trusts. If this law continued in force live yearB longer, Mr. Depew thought, there would not be an independent business man in any of the large cities of the United States. It was creating trusts, and this condition of af fairs was being brought about by the miser able operations of a law intended to pre vent tfiem. 

DEPEW'S REMEDY. In response to the query of Mr. Cullom as to how the evil was to bo cured Mr. De pew said that under the proposed amend ment the roads would be authorized to make contracts npon a business basis, and oould agree upon rates which would be al ways the same to the public The law would empower the companies to enforce their agreements, and the public would be protected by putting the matter under the control of the commission. In discussing the existing conditions Mr. Depew said that it would soon be impossible for manu facturers to exist, except at tenniual points a statement which caused, Mr. Br ice to ask if he was to be understood as meaning that New York and other cities of like character would be favored to the detri ment of sach places as Lima, Newark and other places in Ohio which the Senator named. To this Mr. Depew replied that, under th. operation of the present law, such places would cease to exist except as the summer residences of United States Sena tors. Mr. In galls, president of the Big Four and the Chesapeake & Ohio roads, said that two situations confronted the rail roads of the country. If they went into competition, under the law, the railroads would become bankrupt, or, iu tho end, be forced to make a combination which would put them all under one control, and then the power to regulate them would slip from the grasp of the legislators. The general public now paid the lull rate, while the big dealers were the ones who got the ad vantage of the rebate. Under the existing law, Mr. Ingalls said, the small dealers were being driven out of business, to the great detriment of. the whole coun try, it was for the interest of the whole country that the railroads should prosper. A million of men were employed in the business, and twice that number were en gaged in manufactures that furnished rail road supplies. It was to the interest of the railroads to enforce the law; ami if the law, as the companies were now seeking to have it amended, had been enforced, the principal competitor of the Chesapeake & Ohio would have been bankrupt, so many cases of violation had they made against it. In concluding. Mr. Ingalls said that it had come to the point where the roads were compelled to get under the shadow of the law to keep their business. If the amendment sought passed, it would not re sult in an increase of rates, but in equal ratfs. and in many eases in reduced rates. Many of the railroads had none all they could to break down the interstate-commerce law; but they had become educated, and were now in favor of it. Mr. Walker, of the trunk lines, spoke brieflr, and said the object of the bill was to suppress unhealthy competition; not healthy competition. The committee will probably hold another meeting next Wednesday. Another turn was taken at the interstate commerce law to-day in a bill introdued in the Senate by Mr. McMillan, of Mich igan, in which it is sought to amend the law by making it unlawful for any com mon carrier, subject to the provisions of the existing law, to enter into any contract, agreement, etc, with any other carrier, for the division of the freight of the different competing roads, or to divide between them the aggregate or net proceeds of the earn ings, except as provided in the bill. Each day of the continuanoo of such agreement is deemed a eeparate offense. Agreements such as are prohibited above may be made, provided they are in writing, duly execut ed, and shall not conflict with any other provision of the law. They may become operative only after having been tiled with the Interstate-commerce Commission, and approved by them. After each approval each party is required to deposit sutticient security to guarantee that the agreement will be oarried out. Other sections of the bill deal with details of method, con victions and punishment. IN 

SENATE AND HOUSE. Tote on the McGarrahan Claim Delayed Option Dealer Scored by Senator George. Washington, Dec 14. The famous Mc Garrahan claim occupied the attention of the Senate to-day np to 2 o'clock, when it went over till to-morrow without action. The Vice-president having presented the message of the President, stating the rea- eons why be had not approved the bill passed by both houses last session (refer ring the matter to the Court of Private Land Claims) and havingstatedthequestion to be "Shall the bill pass, the objeotion of the President to the contrary!'' The vote was about being taken by yeas and nays when Mr. Sanders interposed with a sug gestion that some explanation should be made of why the bill should pass. He thereupon entered into an argument to show why, in his opinion, the bill should not pass. Mr. Teller followed in a brief argument in favor of the bilL The bill went over, however, without action and comes up again to-morrow in the morning hour. The anti-option bill was then taken up. and Mr. George resumed his speech in favor of it. lie commenced by saying that he saw in one of the New York pspers that the dealers In futures in the city of New York had undertaken to punish the people of the United States because the Senate had, yesterday, in the performance of its constitutional duty, proceeded to consider this important bill. Cotton had been made to fall 3, or 4. or & points, the dealers in futures thereby undertaking to fores the Senate to cease the performance ot a great constitutional doty. To show that this fall iu cotton was purely ficti tious, purely in the spirit of bravado. - he called attention to the fact that, while cot ton had gone down in New York, corn and provisions had gone np in Chicago. He took it that Senators would treat such threats with that degree of contempt to which they were entitled. In the course of his argument he said, in reference to the suggestion that tho bill should go over till after the holidays, that postponement of action was impossible without giving up the bilL There was, he also said, a blessing in dis guise in the short crop of cotton with which Providence had atUicted the South ern people. That 'blessing was that, while the gamblers and speculators might temporarily depress the price, there was a deficiency for consumption, and the con sumers wonld be obliged to come forwara and take cotton at proper prices. The present time was, therefore, the time when the bill could be passed with the best pros peots of escaping the domination of specu lators. Most of 'Mr. George's speech was devoted to a description and criticism of the modes of business in the New York Cotton Exchange, which be characterized as an "eleemosynary institution,'1 mention ing frequently its "unhallowed tratlio" in phan:om bales." He spoke for over two hours, but had not finished when he yielded lor other business. The anti-option bill went over without action. . ThA resolution otlered yesterday by M?. Daniel, calling for information on the sub ject of li e civil service, was taken no and agreed tc. After a short executive session the henate adjourned. Army Appropriation BUI Passed. Washington, Dec 14. The time of the House to-day was consumed in considera tion of the army appropriation, the first of the regular appropriation bills to be re ported, and, as the outcome showed, the first to be passed. But the early passage of this bill presages nothing. The first ap propriation bill passed by the first session of the House in the present Congress was that providing for the expenses of the Dis trict of Columbia. However, Chairman Outhwaite aud the members of the mili tary committee were elated at the quick action of the House upon their bill to-day. In the morning hour Mr. Cobb, of Mis souri, reported a bill from tho committee on war claims for reference to the private calendar. It is for the relief of the heirs of a Virginia lady who bore the historio name of Mary Ann Randolph Curtis. The amount involved in the bill is $217,000. The bill was originally introduced by Mr. O'Ferrall. A number of bridge construction bills were passed, and then the House went into committee of the whole, Mr. De Ar mond, ot Missouri, in the chair, on the army appropriation bill. Mr. Outhwaite, of Ohio, chairman of the committee on military allairs, made a statement as to the appropriations carried by the bilL. They were 24,:J02,740, against appropriations for the current fiscal year of $-4.2sy,450, and against an estimate of $25,S22.056 for the coming year. , The bill having been read for amend ments Mr. Antony, of Texas, cast a brand of tire into the committee. He moved an amendment providing that before any re tired oilicer or retired enlisted man shall be paid any part of his pay as such retired man the Secretary of War shall ascertain if such person receives pay from the gov ernment in any other oBlcial capacity, and if such is the case he shall not receive any pay under this act. Mr. Antony, in behalf of his amendment, cited the case of a post master in his congressional district who was npon the retired list of the army, and who was also receiving a pension Irom the government. Mr. Bingham, of Pennsylvania, strenu ously Opposed the amendment, and referred to the case of Generals Sickles and Rose crans. to both of whom he paid high com pliment He was ably seconded by Mr. Outhwaite. of Ohio. and. without division, the amendment was rejected. The committed of the whole having risen and the bill having been reported to the lionse, Mr. Antony moved to recommit it to the committee on military affairs, witb instructions to the committee to repor it back amended in the manuer in which it would have been had his former motion prevailed. This was rejeeted, and the bill was passed. The House then adjourned.

He is going to Europe in the Majestio and will oome back on her return trip. "There is no signifi cance iu my.goiug abroad," he said. "I limply want a little rest." He said that there was very little to add to the reports of his 81,500.000 gift to endow and equip the new Armour Institute in Chicago. "The institute has already been turned over to the trustees," Mr Armour said, "and there is a mission attached to it. There is nothing sectarian about the mis sion. Its religion will be sixteen ounces to the pound, but undenomina tional, and it makes no ditierence to me whether its converts are baptized in a soup-bowl, a font, or tha river. Of the $15,000 income lrom the endowment fund, $5.0OO goes to the support of the mission. The institute will be for manual training and education in the arts and sciences. Is will be modeled after the Pratt Institute. of Brooklyn. I eonsnlted with Mr. George W. Childs. John C. Black and my sons Og den and Philip as to the bast methods of condnoting the institute, and acted npon their advice It will be openid in Septem ber.

OIL AND GAS IX JAY COUNTY A Section Where a Dole in ibe Ground Is Certain to Find One or the Other. The Oil Territory Ccmrriscs Tirtnty Sqcart Ililes, Yields 5.000 T-arrels a Day. and DeTClosinect, Prepresses Actively. . Ftaff Ccrrefpcrtdenes or tk Indian spoils Journal. Camden, Ind., Dec 14. This place, al though located in one of the best sections of the gas belt, has as yet derived but lit tle advantage from the development of wells. Located thirteen miles Irom rail way facilities, manufacturers have not yet been able to avail themselves of its gas Uow because of the impossibility of getting their product to the market. No advantage has thus far accrued to the town from the gas aside from that derived from local use and the disposal made of it for fuel and lighting purposes to Decatur, Bluflton and other conveniently adjacent towns. Much gas is struck here, but it is "anchored" or confined in the well, to be used when occa sion calls for it. At present the development of the oii field is exciting a new interest among the people They feel that their gas is an as sured fact, and as soon as railroad facilities can be obtained they will bring to Camden the same advantages that have come to her sister cities throughout the belt. The oil in this vicinity has undoubtedly, thus far, brought more capital into this part of the belt than the gas. This held is in au infant state of development, and whether or not the "strike" will prove a large and permanent one is a question which time alone can determine The field of oil. eo far as ascertained, would appear to extend from Geneva, in Adams county, to Montpelier, in Blackford county, a dis tance of about twentv miles, with an av erage width of one mile. This district is divided into two sections, or "pools," as they are locally called, the Camden pool, cr deposit, being located here; the Updegrafi or second, division of the workings is situated six miles north of this point. The Camden division is the better developed, furnishing about one bill the product of the belt The total output of the entire oil seotlon is about live thousand barrels per day. Ot this 2,5 barrels are drawn from the Camden deposit, the remainder being supplied by the UpdografTpool and the remaining parts of the district what iias been done. There are about three hundred wells al ready driven in the belt, the larger num ber of which are located on the Camden and Updegraff pools. It must not be sup posed that each of these properties is a producer. At least 25 per cent are "dry holes." A "dry hole," let it be understood, means one containing gas only. Total failure of results never occurs. If the seeker for oil fails to find it he is certain to obtain a tine flow of gas; which, if not so immediately profitable, is prospectively valuable The average capital put into active op eration throughout the belt may be esti mated by the cost of sinking a well, the price paid for leases, the payment of royal ties, etc The average coht of driving a well is 81,700; contractors pay tl per acre per year for lands, und give a royalty, usually its equivalent in cash, of one-eighth of the product. The cost of development alone througnont tne twenty sonars miles of the district would approximate half a million of dollars. The product from the two principal pools is piped to Montpelier, where it is tanked and placed upon the market The com panies operating here are the Buckeye Oil Company, a branch of the Standard; the Northern Indiana, and the Portland Oil and Gas Company. The latter company dis covered the oil in the Caipden held while boring for gas. There have been wells struck here whose flow, for a few hours, ran at as high a rate as nine hundred barrels per day. One well here is active at three hundred barrels per day, but this is far above the average. It was reported some days ago that an eigbt-hundred-barrel "gusher" bad been struck near Portland, but investigation proved tne report raise
