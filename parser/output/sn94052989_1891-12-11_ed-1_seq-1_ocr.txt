Berlin, Pec. 10.—In the Reichstag to doy Chancellor yon Caprivi opened tlie de bate on the new commercial treaties, mak ing a strong appeal in favor of their adop tion, lie dwelt upon the fact that the pres ent import and export relations would ruin both employers and employes. The meas ures under discussion were necessary to preserve Germany's husbandry and com n:erce. Continuing, the Chancellor said the iv,mediate effect of the treaties upon the finances of the empire would he the diminu tion of the revenue nearly 1S.(X)O,OOO mark 9. This was a matter that required much con sideration. Speaking on the qu. stion of the differential treatment of the countries not included in the treaties, he said it was needless to speak of Russia. The lament able distress in that count ry would not be removed for some time and it was useless to discuss what would be done afterward. As regards the United State?, tha two Gov ernments had decided to continue on the basis of the arrangements of 1885, whereby the United States received the most favored nation treatment. In connection with the alleeed distress in Germany, he said the agriculture of the country could bear, Without risk, a reduction in thetaiiff rate of one and a half mark*. In the matter of wine it had been the aim to Compel a sharp competition agaiusi artificial wines, cchnapt'S, and so-called "French" clarets, is to provide on German soil a battle tieid for Italian wives against these of France. The reduction in the duties on the necrfsaries of life was of advantage tn tne worklna peonle.

The treaties jus; concluded will give a sure guarantee lor thn future." lltrr yon Kanitz (Conservative) opposed the Chancellor's policy. Il« regretted that the negotiations showed that they had only free-trHde eouuselors. He looked forward to the ruin of the German agricHlturist.

Ik-rr Kaidcff read a telegram stating that liismarck did not iu tecd to ap; tar during the debate. ♦■ THE BAH QUESTION. Newfoundland's Retaliation Against Canada for Duties Imposed. St. Johns (X. F.), Dec. 10— In retaliation for the duties imposed by Canada on New foundland fish, tne Government has put into force the section of the act asaiuif-Canaaa which increases the duties on articles im ported from C.inaia. The Herald of this city and the Harbor Grace Standard strongly condemn the ac tion of the Government in placing the re taliatory law in force, and declare it is most suicidal. On the ether hand the Telegram, an organ of the Government, says: "The people of Newfoundland are pleased with the action of the Government in excluding intermed dling and officious Canada from free access to our bait fisheries, and the wisdom of this course will be emphasized in a very forcible manner before the close of next year's fish ing season. Every fisherman In Newfound land knows that but fur the stand taken against this colony by Canada we should to day be enjoying the inestimable advantage of free lra<le with the United States. Canada deserves no favorable considera tion at our hands. She has been Corrupt at borne and treacherous to her sister colonies, and the feeling in Newfoundland to-day is the less we have to do with her the better." THE BRITISH FEELING. Farther Comments by London Papers on the President's Message. London, Dec 10.— The St. Junes Gazette, commenting to-day on President Harrison's message, says the most important point in the document is that Dart which has refer ence to the result of the McKinley tariff, The figures presented, the Gazette declares, compare significantly with British figures which remain stationary." The calculations of the supporters of the McKinley bill are working out much better than anyone in England had reason to expect. The Globe sarcastically comments on the message which, it say», is adroitly traced on catch-note lines. The nervous Yankees are assured that the Government knows how to climb down ** in the cases of Chile and the Behring Sea dispute. Lord Salisbury, the Globe adds, need not be much frightened at President Harrison's tremendous menace and expression of concern at foreign en croachments upon territories controlled by American governments. The Globe dis putes the statement made in the message that the prosperity of the United Slates is entirely due to the McKiuley bill. Ou the contrary, It says, the prosperity or the coun try is due to the exceptional harvest thereat a time when Europe is short of grain. ♦ THE 

FRENCH ALLIANCE. A Senator Opposed to a Compact With Bas ■ia. Pakif, Dec. 10.—Senator Saiut llilaire ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, said to an Associated Press correspondent to-day that he is distinctly opposed to the attempt to draw France and Kussia into an alliance. He can discover no common bonds of union between the most enlightened people of Europe and a country almost Eastern in its barbarity. The prevalent Idea in Ifranee is that this alliance will enable her to regain ncr lost province.", while she will help Bus sia to lay bunds on Constantinople. But while Kussia will not fail to seize every op portunity of increasing her empire, she would not embroil herself with Europe in order to please France, and, when satisfied, would repudiate any claims the latter power might have on her. In his opinion the most natural and profitable alliance for France would be one with England. ITALY'S FKIENDSHIP. The Hew Orleans Incident to Be Satisfac torily Adjusted. Rome, Dec 10 —In the Chamber to-day.re plylng to questions on Italy's relations with the United States, Premier Budini aaid he had taken note of the friendly expressions in President HarrUou's message aud felt con fident that the que^ions at m-im between the countries would soon be settled.

Dec. 10.— North China Herald of the yth of October gives particu lars of the salt liken riot in Faien province. The place or town was ielilina. not Chauehua as reported. The leader of the insurgents is named Chen and he lias a tone under bis command on the top of the hill outside of the city of some 3000 men. Under pretense of opposing liken squeezes or tax on salt the force was formed. The first expedition was formed against the salt liken nffice, which was burned. One unfor tunate fell into the hands of the insur gents, who nailed his hand* and feet to a hoard Rnd cut him up piecemeal. The victim was considered a sacrifice to their flag. When the Insurgents, flusher with sure, made a complete circuit around the city, they met with stubborn resistance from a volunteer force of about oi;e thousand strong, which repulsed every attempt to take the walls by assault. For three days the city held out ana provisions ran short. Although agitated by fear and harass d by hunger, the defenders stood nobly to their post in the desperate hope of an early res cue by the imperial ops. Tile Insurgents seized a favorable moment to send a large force to storm the defense, when a bloody struggle ensued, resulting in favor of the attacking party. The leader was the first one to lean over the wall, and rushing straight to the magistrate's yamen he first liberated all the prisoners. Tin- authorities have dispatched a thousand soldiers to the place. The latest report is that the Insur gents have lelt the city and are encamped on the hill. ANOTHER INSURRECTION. There has been another disturbance at Telilma in consequence of th« increase of the salt tax some time ago. The authorities have now ag tin had to send troops to the spot. It is reported that the riot has ex tended into two other districts, Turgohun and Yowkl, and that if the authorities do not succeed at once in suppressing the tumult nothing can prevent the movement from assuming a foruiid'.ble character. While the trouble was originally a simple salt riot, the Kalao Sui have since taken ad vantage of the ri-iins to join it. It is said that ''Kuan po win pom," meaning "Tyran ny creates rebellion," is a motto written upon their banners, and that their tactics are to retreat to their mountain fastnesses when the soldiers arrive, and come out again when the troops retire.

FRANCISCO. FRIDAY MORNING. DECEMBER 11. 1891-EIGHT PAGES. DEMANDS ON CHILE. . ; Claims for Damages to Foreign Property. Minister Malta Makes a Sarcastic and Strong Protest i Residents Id Chile Must Take Their Chances, Like the Natives—Small Proba bility of Justice. trtcltl to Tin Mottxixu Cac.6. New York, Dec. 10.—The Herald's Val paraiso special cablegram says: Foreign M hi-tiT M;i -.'.a, in his report to the Con gress relative to the claims made against Chile by foreigners, says the Govern ment is bound in duty to administer strict justice. The Chilean " Ministry, however, he adds, rejects all at tempts to formulate claims which at times have been allowed in America owing to the special circumstances under which the Governments against whom such claims are preferred were placed toward those in whose favor they were formulated. To countenance the present attempts would be to create in favor of foreigners privileges that are allowed neither by the State nor by international law. By virtue of the mere fact that a foreigner takes up his residence in Chile, it chows that ho ikes it and that it suits him. lie would further wish to acquire the right to impose on the Government an obligation to secure him against rainfall and disastrous events that afflict the Chileans as well as the foreigners, and which are en tirely due to superior force, as in the case (if August 28th and 29ih. While tin-re is no doubt that the claims of prominent British merchants are in several cases grossly exaggerated, still in the end the Chilean Government cannot refuse to pay a Jarge portion of the claims made for the sacking and looting in Valparaiso, Vina del Maraud Santiago, as well as for the dam ages to the nitrate railroad and the detention of steamers. — « 

SUNOL. IN MEW YORK. Bonner Not Troubled Over Rumored Lame ness of the Famous Trotter.

Tlie mare seemed to have suffered very slight fatigue in her long ride across the continent. Bonner was probably the happiest m in in this city tills morning. Iln said: "Sunol had been lame before 1 bought her, but I did nut know it until I had paid fur tier. The lameness was caused by a. slight defect in the near hind foot. I telegraphed Mar vin, telling him what kind of shoe to use, and, instead of u*ing a number of decoctions, as California rumor says, lie followed my in structions to the letter. He was Dot nidig ii 'Hit at my suEgestion I*,1 *, bat on tiie contrary sent me a letter in which he said: 'If I had known as much about th« balancing of the feet of horses twenty years ago as you have taught me 1 would have lowered Hie world's record several times before this.'" Uniiner added: "I can't Imagine how the story about Sunnl's lameness could have been started. I never regarded her lameness any more serious than mud splashed on my shirt bosom, which could be easily removed. It was no doubt started by some of the many trap and owners to whom 1 have refused to Impart my knowledge, gained by thirty years' hard study and practical ex perience." The greptine between Bonner and Afarvfn did not betray the existence of any feeling other than the kindliest. Homier called Marvin's attention to the printed accounts of Sand's lameness "She Is sound and well," siiid the trainer. "She hasn't a pim ple or even a windfall on her. She was not lame when we left California, and hasn't been seriously ianje in her life." Tilli ORATES TRIAL. Analysis of the Contents of the Bottle Sent to Mrs Barnaby.

CROP REPORTS. Condition of Winter Wheat— High Prices Ruling for Cereals. Washington, Dec. 10.— report of the Department of Agriculture gives the condition of the growing wheat as 85.3. The returns showing the condition of the com ing crops of winter ims are not generally favorable. On the Atlantic Const some In jury is reported on the early sown areas from the Hessian fly. The season is not favorable for seeding in the South on ac count of tho continued dry weather, and tlie germination is slow from the same cause. Rains in the late autumn have improved tho prospect. In the Western States seeding is late, the seed-bed hard and cloddy and germination slow. The growth was favor able until November, when a material im provement was seen in most of the fields. In some districts the Hes sian fly mado its appearance, can-ing damage. The crop is 85.3, the average is 97. The condition of rye is little higher than : that of wheat, making an average of 88.8.

Manufacturing Industries to Be Investi gated— The First Batch of Bills In troduced In the Senate. Special to The Mousing Call. Washington, Dec. 10. — Congressman Springer, who is likely to be Chairman of tho Ways and Means Committee, If Mills is offered and declines the honor, said to-day that his policy with reference to the tariff was to provide for free wool, free salt, free lumber, free cotton-tie?, free coal and free binding-twine. Ho said: "I do not think we should attempt a general revision of tho tariff at this time. We should offer the country relief by passing bills for putting the articles named on the free list and send ing them to the Senate. A general tariff bill cannot be enacted into a law, and would keep Congress here until October. 1 think there should be appointed a strong commit tee on manufacture?, with able investigators on it. It should consist of fifteen members —ten Democrats and five Republicans. This would make five sub-committees of three each. They should divide the work, one investigating textile Industrie*, another I iron production.", another glassware and pottery, and so on. Tliis committee would he a sort of adjunct to the Ways and .Means Committee, which could go on with its work and then subsequently get all the testimony without a long Hit of hearings. Theso sub-commit . tees could go on during tho session and also during the recess. Their Inquiries should not bo conducted with a spirit of hostility toward the manufacturers, but with a view to ascertain bottom facts and ascertain in each case what, if any. de gree of protection is needed, as I have a suspicion j that frequently it is represented that they need a great deal more protection than is really the case. It should be. ascer tained what labor rusts on things produced, wages paid, whether work bo steady or not, the profits ou actual capi'al and not on "watered" stock; the relative stock of pro duction here and abroad; and whether there are tacit or direct agreements to limit production, and much more information of a practical character.

The act, it is provided, shall preclude the entry into the United States, not only of Chinese laborers who have never been here, but of all who have been here and departed ; also all Chinese persons who may desire to pass through or over the United' States for any purpose whatever.

Chinese found unlawfully within the juris diction of the United State* shall be re moved to China.

'■> ' ; The Star ' gays: "Tammany is but slimly represented in Washington at this time, mid if anything unto ward happens before to morrow Kit-hard Cioker of the city and r r" \, —: State or New York will have to shoulder the blame. Mr. Croker is generally cred ited with being tl:e 'boss' of Tammany. iceman Turner, who isMoorkeeper of the House, evidently Is of mat opinion, for when Mr. Croker, yesterday telegraphed 1 urner to come 'to New York Turner could not get to the depot too ran i, ■»• ' soon as tlie Tammany men in the New York delegation heard of the ukase received by Turner they, too. resolved to return homo, and as a consequence Judge Tim Campbell is the only lammanyite at the capital to-day. I he Judge believes there is or hits been by tins time a consultation at Tammany head quarters ovef the offices which the door keeper controls. There are 152 positions and the total sum annually disbursed ex ceeds $131,000. Tammany wants the biggest slice of that pie and will probably get it." APPROPIUATION9 BEQUIUED. Secretary Foster to-day transmitted to the Speaker of the He.use for the information of Congress the estimates of the appropriations required fur the fiscal year of 1893, as fur nished by the heads of the several executive department*. Some of the details are of interest. The estimate for the army and navy is $47,064,580, which is a decrease of $& 748,683 from the amount appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30,1892, which Includes the deficiency appropriation of 939,350,598. The amount of the estimates under the general head of naval establish ment is $28,865,65*, which Is something over $5,000,000 less than the present appropria tion. -Nearly all of this reduction is made In the estimate for tho increase of the navy, the estimate for this item being §12,280,855. For h building for the library of Congress $1,035,000 is asked. 

DECLINE IX MARINE UNDERWRITING. Commissioner of Navigation Bates, in his animal report, dwells on marine Insurance, and says: "Wo arc fast drifting into de pendency on foreign underwriting. The manifest decadence of our underwriting power is of national concern. It is as neces sary to have marine underwriting of our own as commerce of our own, or shipping of our own. Marine insurance is a facility and power fur the command of trade needful in peace, but essential in war. The under writing of our enemy is not to be. thought of; that of a rival never should bo de pended on." The Commissioner recom mends the abrogation of the treaty with Great Britain which prevents the building 'of armed vessels on tlie lakes, and the re peal of thn act of 1852 authorizing the nationalization of foresgn vessels. LIABILITY OF CANADIAN RAILWAYS. Tho General Pass-enger Agents of the Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific rail ways have been in correspondence with the Treasury Department in regard to the lia bility of those roads in the transportation if Chinese seeking admission Into the United States. It appears Hint it has been suggested to the railway officials that their reactive companies violate the law rela ting to the exclusion ot Chinese when they convey to points in the United States per sons not lawfully entitled to enter our terri tory. The Treasury Department takes this view of the case and has instructed the proper officials so to notify the railway au thorities. THE POSTOFFICE SITE. Assistant Secretary Crounse of the Treas ury Department said to-day that the San Francisco I'ostoffice Commission had made another report recommending the .Seventh and Mission streets property fora l'ostcftice site, with the narrow slip belonging to Mr. Mogan left out, and stilting thai L. G. llaivey would therefore take about $3400 le-s than the $1,040,000 asked. It is believed that it will take a li ng time to get action on this new roport, as it seems difficult to get the Cabinet officers together to consider this matter. PEnSOXAL MENTION.
