Company charge chaotic conditions of bookkeeping, gro?s neglect of duty, misapplication of large funds nd loose methods of conducting the i.istitution. Startling disclosures are made and the report asserts that the State lost many thousands of dollars. The company says that with opport inity of ^xamin:ng missing books disclosures dwarfing those just made would result. It submits a bill for $8,000 for its services. Many irregularities and criminalities are charged in the report, which consists of 250 typewritten pages. For one year alone arbitrary entries aggregrate $100,000 and one book over $30,000. Illustrating the loose methods the report says: UNAUTHORIZED ENTRIES. "In order to illustrate more fully the extent to which unauthorized entries were carried, we rrfer in detail to two entries in journal 1, folios 123 and 124, for $5,000 each, under date of September 30. 1906, made for the purpose of transferring $10 ,000 from the account of the Carolina Glass Company to the account of the Richland Distilling Company.

How a Plucky Little Woman Saved ! Her Valuables. Mrs. Theresa Calona Finds Noted ' Crook in Her Home, Turns Hini Over to Police and Faints. Mrs. Theresa Calono chased a burglar down two flights of stairs in her ; home, No. 74 Elder street, Williams- ' burg, Wednesday evening and cap tured him after a struggle. Then she 1 handed him over to a policeman. 1 Admiring neighbors who called to oiler congratulations marvelled at the pluck of the pretty, slender young woman. They marvelled the more when they heard that the man was a desperate crook and that he nad been released only recently after -<erving a two years' term at Sing Sing Prison. Mrs. Calono is the wife of Joseph Calono, a well-to-do commission merchant. She is twenty-eight years of age, and is much admired for her beauty. When she returned at 6:30 o'clock from a shopping trip she was surprised that her rooms were lighted up. She found every jet burning in the dining room. Hearing a rustling in the next room, she entered. A man, kneeling on the floor, was packing articles he had taken from a dresser into a bag. She had not made the least noise, and he went on with his work, unconscious of her presence. "What are you doing here?" she demanded. The startled burglar looked up, sprang to his feet and dashed into the parlor. The door leading from that room to the hall was locked. The man darted back again toward the dining room. Mrs. Calono had preceded him but, before she could lock the dining room door, he had overtook her. She grappled with him, but the man struck her in the face, and, shaking himself loose, ran along the hail to the stairway and down to the ground floor. Mrs. Calono, unmindful of the blow she had received, followed close at his heels. In the ground floor hall, she tripped him by interposing her foot as he was springing for the front door. He recovered his balance, and then she hit him a blow that sent him spinning backward. The burglar retreated to the back end of the hall. Fearing he would go down to the basement and escape, the plucky woman 1 L.' 1 cwrnereu nun ana again grappled ] with him. 1 Then ensued a struggle that took J them from one end of the hall to the ' other. The man gradually edged his ] way to the front door and managed 1 to get it open. He dragged Mrs. Calono through ? it to the front step, and was about tc 1 make another effort to jerk himself loose when the policeman approach- i ed. He relieved Mrs. Calono of her | prisoner, and she sank, almost fainting. on the doorstep. There she was found by neighbors, who, strange to say, had not heard her cries during the struggle in the hall. At least they had not responded. Mrs. Calono had a bruise on her right cheek. The thief had pilled up all of the silver and also all the loose jewelry he could find in the house. At the Ralph avenue police station the man gave the name of Matthew Endrick. He said he was thirtveight years old, and had no home. The police recognized in him and old offender. of $320.95 was closed out on March 31, 1905, by transferring same to the account of J. S. Farnum. The successors to Farnum denied any knowledge of this account and refused to nay it. "It would appear that this account, if not settled, had been neglected for a period of nearly three years prior to its being buried by an unauthorized transfer, resulting in a touii toss to tne state." DUE FOR CONSTABULARY. 1 At the close of business on Feb- ^ ruary 16. 13 connties in the State t owed to the State dispensary $25, t 490.15 on account of constabulary t service. This amount is based upon j the enforcement of section 7 of the v Brice law in counties which voted e out the dispensary under that act. According to the report but two counties have made the levy necces- ' sary to place funds with the State r treasurer for the purpose of discharging their obligations to the r dispensary in this particular. The 3 counties of Pickens and Newberry !i have settled their indebtedness, t amounting to $2,549.16, leaving t $22,941.78 due by eleven counties. d A balance of $6.60 against John 3 Black, former member of the board of directors, represents a charge on December 21, 1906, for one ton of | n coal, the collection of which is con-' g tingent on a counter claim made by John Black for mileage and per diem ; allowance of $4 per day for five days on a trip to Peoria, III., in Decern- t ber. 1906. v "This matter rests with the com- ii mission for such action as may be t deemed necessary," states the re- ? port. r CLAIM AGAINST CHARLESTON. Several pages in the report are .1 1 - 1 ? - revoiecn.o inn account or the city of ' ? Iharleston. It is set forth that c 56,361.65 is the amount of profits s iviteheld from the city of Charles- c ;on. Against this claim upon the * iispeosary there is a counter clai n o >f $7,678.68 against the city. Of t :his latter claim, $5,462.78 repre-! jents the expenses incurred by the Sdate dispensary resulting from the lifficulty between Wieters and State ? sonstables. The remainder of the L sharge, $2,515.90, represents the ex- d senses of the constabulary force in n he city of Charleston from July 18. [901, to Octobet 9, 1901. The account as adjusted shows hat the city of Charleston is due v 1* State dispensary $1,317.13. jr< GROWS SECOND. South Carolina Next to Massachu- I setts in Cotton Manufacture. Hie Cold Statistics* of IIhj United States Census Reveals the Above Facts. The cold statistics of the United States census bureau frequently repeal some wonderful things. Among these, in a bulletin just issued, is that South Carolina ranks second in tne number of cotton spindles in the United States, being exceeded only 1 If 1 ** ' * - 1 uy massacnuseiis, ana cnac during Lhe past year South Carolina actually increased the number of spindles more than 150,000. This interesting bulletin says: Massachusetts exceeds every other State in the number of cotton spiniles, having 9,158,389, or 34 percent of the total; South Carolina ranks second, with 3.609,969, or 13 per cent, and Nortn Carolina third, with 2,J)81,386, or 10 per cent, Rhode Island has fourth place, Georgia fifth, New Hampshire sixth and Connecticut seventh. Massachusetts increased its number of active spindles during the year by 307,443, or 3.5 per cent pf the total for the State, while in North Carolina the increase amounted to 262,652, or 11 per cent. The increase in South Carolina was more than 450,000 and in New York nearly 100,000. According to Table 3 there were 1,141,661 cotton spindles, exclusive of renewals, added during the year, thus indicating no cessation nthe progressof the industry. However, the net increase in the total lumber of spindles for the year is 1,127,734. This apparent discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that i few plants were dismantled or ibandoned, and to the reduction of the spindle capacity in others. In its annual investigation relative to the cotton industry the bureau makes no endeavor to segregate frame and mule spindles; but if the proportion between these spindles as returned at the census of 1905, when this was done, be applied to the statistics of active spindles in 1907 the ligures would be 20.427,395 frame wd 5,947,8% mule. In addition to the spindles designed primarily to spin cotton. 751/251 lave been returned as consuming cotton mixed with other fibres. The Q fuu wKinU lnn/I 1 -? ? * ^VMWW VTiilUI IVttU ill Hit" IIlciMUiaCLure of woollen and knit goods naturally lead in the number of these jpindles. Of the total number reported, 137,190, or 21 per cent, were returned from Pennsylvania; 110,362, or 17 per cent, from New York; 70,462 from Massachusetts, 52,630 from Connecticut, and smaller numbers from several other States. Massachusetts leads in the consumption of cotton with 1,253,856 bales or 35 per cent of the total for 1907, followed by North Carolina vith 14 per cent, while South Carolina takes third place with 13 per :ent. The fourth position is held by Georgia with 11 percent; New Hampshire takes fifth. Alabama sixth, and Mew York seventh. As slated above, i comparison on the basis of active mindles gives some of the States a slightly different rating. Although Massachusetts increased its cotton spindles by more than 300,000, the quantity of cotton consumed increasid less than 20.000 bales. If the statstics for South Carolina be examinjd in a similiar manner it will be found that the quantity of cotton ;onsumed during the year is 5,705 >ales less, while the number of spinlies operated increased more than 150,000. This would indicate a siglificant tendency during the year to spin finer counts, provided, of course, hat the conditions prevailing in the wo years were similiar and the spinlies were operated in like manner. In the mills of the cotton g -owing states 970,039 spindles were reported as having been idle throughout he year, which is 66 per cent of the die spindles returned for the entire :ountry. While the scarcity of labor s largely responsible for this condiion throughout the country, it ap>ears more pronounced in the cotton growing States However, as stated >lsewhere. a considerable number of he spindles returned as idle from he cotton growing States were not n fact idle throughout the year, but vere new, and had only been install:d a short time. The Newberry Observer says 'Col. William Jennings Bryan may lever be president, but he has furtished to the American people an example of fidelity to principle, fearessness in advocating them, and un lemished private and political inegrity, that is entire too rare nowalays." That is a handsome, but deerved, compliment. Justice Brewer seems sorry to , iave caused trouble, but he is not ;oing to take it back.

SOIL SURVEY. | Prof. Bennett is Conducting Ex- | periments in This State. Orangeburg, Sumter and Lee Counties Being Now Looked After by an Kxpert. The farmers of Sumter, Orangeburg and Lee counties are to be giveu the benefit of the soil experimentation that has been conducted at Washington by the bureau of soils, depratment of agriculture, for the past fenyears. The bureau has sent out Prof Frank Bennett to arrunge for the practical application ot the test and he will go to work at once in the counties named, so that the soil may be gotten into shape by next spring. The plan that the dapertment is going to offer to the farmers is in the interest of better, more economical and more diversified crops. One of the chief aims of the experiments to be conducted is to find out the correct rotation of crops on a given piece of land so as to secure the best results and to point out to the farmers what is the best method to pursue in order to give his land?rest and get therefrom the greatest yield at the lowest expense. The work will be conducted by the representative of the department at no cost to the farmer and when u working basis is found full information will be given out to the farmers of the State, so that all may reap the benefit from the proposed plun. Within the past few years the department of agriculture has Interested Itself in the work of a possible development of the soil of the Southern States. It has been reallxed that there are latent possibilities here which if scientifically developed would be a surprise to many. To this end a large part of the appropriation given the department has been PYBAnrlpH In tHo QjnttK And one of the many important steps taken for the ultimate benefit of the Southern furmers is an experiment survey of lands in the counties of Sumter. Lee and Orangeburg. This is the first experiment of the kind ever undertaken by the department. Congressman Lever has been instrumental in bringing this about and the scheme is outlined below and is supposed to enlighten the farmer on the subject of the best methods of planting his farm in order to secure the best results financially. The soil surveys of the counties of Sumter and Orangeburg have just been completed, while that of Lee county was completed some time since. Prof. Frank Bennett of the United States department of agrlcul ture, bureau of soils, is in charge of these surveys. The chief of the bureau is Prof. Milton Whitney, at one time professor of chemistry at the University of Souuth Carolina. Mr. Bennett is a Southern man, a graduate of the University ot N'orth Carolina and a practical farmer. He has the supervision of these maps, which give contour maps showing the character of soil, streams, towns, houses, etc. This is known as a base map. The character of the ,?oils is represented by colors, so each farmer knows what soil he has upon hit; individual farm, and thus he wi!" see what crops are best adap'.uJ to his particular soil after following the work done by the bureau of soils In order to make the maps inure practical Mr. Bennett has been put in charge of the fertilizer and crop experiments. Samples of these soils in the three counties have been sent to Washington and have been carried through what si known as the "wire basket test. The test is brie'J-y as follows: About one bushel of soil is divided into about 25 small baskets and then in these baskets various seeds are planted with various kinds of fertilizer. The object of this is to see the result of plant growth and to get a fertilizer formula. When this formula is obtained it will be used in the held whose soil corresponds to the soil tested. Mr. Heunett is here to put this test in the fields from his personal observation and experience in Washington. This test is to be 1 put to each type of soil encounted in ! the three counties named above. The plan Mr. Hennett proposes to * pursue is to get u cetrain number of 1 farmers in each of the counties named that are willing to cooperate in 1 these experiments. Two or three ' acres are to be taken in and every 1 knowjt fertilizer will be used thereon. And then new crops, such as the ' vetches, clover, grasses, alfalfa, fruit and trucking will be ntroduced. Hut 1 the staple crops, such as cotton-? 1 particularly the uplnnd, long staple? 1 corn, oats and the like, will be given ! special attention. The new crops, the vetches and the like are to be Introduced as accessories of these -j principal crops and as a method of Ikn I ? . J > * 1 uiitt iiuuuiiuiiuii oi me crop rotation, i These experiments look ultimately 1 to the ascertalnent of certain fer- I tllizer formulas and crop practice* J' which will give the largest yield -with 1 i minimum expense with the staple ' srops. It is sought to ascertain what ;1 ;rop can be most profitably grown 15 upon a given type of soil nnd what ' <ind of fertilizer is best ahapted to f ? given type of soil and what quanti- c :y .'of fertilizer can be economically I used upon a given soil with a given i1 :rop. !
