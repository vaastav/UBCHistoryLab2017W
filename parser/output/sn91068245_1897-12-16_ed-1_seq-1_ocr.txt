While it is true that the greater part of the proceed of these were used to supply deflsint revenues, a considerable portion was required to maintain the gold reserve. - "With our revenues tqual to our expenses, there would be no deficit requiring the issuance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below $100, 000,000; how will it be replenished except by selling mora bonds? Is there any other way practicable un der existing law! The question then is, shall -we continue the policy that Las been pursued in the past; that is, when the gold recurve reaches the point of danger, issue more bonds And supply the needed gold, or shall we provide other means to prevent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve T ii no further legislation is had and the policy of selling bonds is to bo continued, then ConcrresH should irive the Secretary of the Treasury authority to sell bonds at long or snort periods, bearing a less rate of interest than is now author ized by law. iOLD FOR UNITED STATES NOTES UOTH OOINO AND COMING. "I earnestly recommended, as soon as tho receipts of the government are quite sullicient to pay all the ex penses of tn government, that when . o l ft r . , any oi me unnea mates notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart, and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of me United btates note prefers the geld and gets it from the govern ment he should not receive back from the government a United States note without paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the in are apparent when the gov eminent issnes an interest-bearing debt to provide gold for the redemp tion or v nited states notes a non- interest bearing debenture and should not pay them out again ex cept on demand, and for gold. If they are put in any other way they would return again to be followed by auother bond issue to redeem them anotht r interest-bearing debt to redeem a non-interest bearing debt: THE HANKS SHOULD HEAR SOME OP THE HURDEN.

If we are to have an era of prosperity in the country, with sufficient receipts for the expenses of the government, we may feel no immediate embarrass ment from our present currency, but the danger still exists and will be ov er present, menacing us so long as the existing system continues. Aud besides, it is in times of adeqn&te revenues and business tranquility that the government should prepare for the worst.

SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY 6 FLAN. The Secretary of the Treasury ha outlined a plan in great detail, for the purpose of removing that recur rence of a depleted gold reserve, and save us from future embarrassir eat on that account. To this plan I in vite your careful consideration. "I concur with the Secretary of tbe Treasury in this recommendation that national banks be allowed to is sue notes to the face value cf the bonds which they have deposited !or circulation, and that the tax or, cir culating notes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one-1 alf of one per cent, per annum. I aho j oin him in recommending that aut ,orUy be given for the establishment of na tional banks with a minimum capi tal of $25,000. This will enable the smaller villages and agricultui .l re gions of the country to be supplied with currency to meet their needs. "I recommend that the issue of national bank notes be restricted to the denomination of ten dollars and upwards. If the suggestions I have herein made shall have the ap proval of Congress, then I would rec ommend that national banks be re quired to redeem their notes in gold." CUBA. Turning to foreign affairs, the President devotes a great part of his message to a consideration of the Cuban question, which he says is the most important problem with which this government is now called upon to deal pertaining to its foreign re lations. The story of Cnba has for many years been one of unrest and for no enduring period has it ceased to cause concern to the United States. Briefly summarizing the history of the former outbreaks and the part continue but will be humane and conducted with all regard for private rights, beiu? accompauied by politi cal action leading to the autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanish sov ereignty. It further suggests that lert tree to conduct th military op erations and grant political reform, while the United States, for is part, shall enforce neutial obligations and cut off the assistance which, it is as serted, the insurgents receive from this country. The supposition of an indefinite prolongation of the war is denied and complete and early pacif ication is hoped for, which with the immediate amelioration of existing conditions in Cuba, would remove cause for any change of attitude on the part of the United States." 7.

MEHATE. Tne first discussion io tie Senate was on Tuesday, and arose over tbe form of the credentials presented by llon.Uernando IXMoney, appointed by the Governor of the state of lfissis- sippi to flli tbe unexpired term of Sen ator George, whose death occurred a few months ago. Exceptions was taken by Senators Chandler (of New Hamp shire) and Uoar (of Massachusetts) to tbe wording of the credentials, which they claimed were erroneously drawn up in tbat they attempt to rive to the Executive of the State of Mississippi tbe power to revoke tbe appointment of Money at any time. They withdrew (beir objection, as.it was evidently an error, but gave notice that in future they would insist upon credentials be ing in proper form. Errors ot this kind have occurred in one or two pre vious instances. Tbe President submitted a communi cation to Congress in which be recom mended an appropriation of abiut one million dollars for tbe exhibit to be made on behalf of this goverment at tbe Paris Exposition in 1900. Senator Morgan (of Alabama) intro duced and passed a resolution which, arter citing irom tne i'resident mes. sage with reference to the Kansas Pa cific Railroad, in which tbe Preident submits the question to Congress whether the government, rather than accept less than its claim on this road should become a bidder and thereby tbe owner of the property di rects in the resolution the At torney General to send to the Senate a full statement of the au thority for and proceedings under which the proposed sale of this road is to take place on tbe lGtb inst. and re quests the president to obtain a post ponement of such sale in order to give Congress a reasonable time in which to consider and set upon the recom mendations in his message. Senator Butler ottered some amendments to his postal savings bank bill which he introduced during the last session of Congress, and gave notice tbat he would at an early day submit some re marks in support of his bill and amendments.
