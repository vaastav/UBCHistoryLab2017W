THE PACIFIC COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER HOIfOLOLTJ, DECEMBER 13, 1901. EST WILL FiGH SUGAR : OVER CUBA r . THE HAWAIIAN SUGAR CROP. The New York Sun has recently pub lished data from Honolulu to November 19. In which It was stated that this year's sugar crop was the largest in the history of the Islands and a total of ..':-. tons, against 296.544 tons last year. This enor mous development in the sugar Industry of Hawaii is the result, of course, tlrst of the reciprocity treaty with the United t:.its, the Hawaiian control of semi foreed labor and the wonderful climate, so favorable to sugar cane, that the Isl ands pos-ses.. The present difficulties in regard to the control of lalor are developing great ef forts to secure Improved labor saving devices, and a cane cutting machine Is one of the devices that Is very much de sired in Hawaii, as well as in Louisiana.

Swanzy Returns From the Capi ital and Discu.sscs Prospects. F. M. Swsuizy, after a month's absence on the mainland, durinir which time he travelled across the country and snent pome time In Xew York and Wuhlnz ton on business, returned to the city yesterday on the Serra. Mr. Swanzy was one of the party of Hawaiians who called upon President Roosevelt, and who also looked Into affairs Hawaiian at the various departments. Numerous Interviews were held with members of bo.th the House and Senate, and the members of the party were given every opportunity to become acquainted with the status of affairs at the capital. Mr. Swanzy said yesteiday: "While we were in Washington, we had every opportunity to corau in contact with the heads of the various deiart- ments.and he had aevera interviews. At the suggestion of Mr. John W. Foster, the members of our party went to call upon I'lestdent Roosevelt, very infor Ima.ly. The president received us cordial ly. :tnd gave us some time In general conversation, as to the outlook. Presi dent Roosevelt did not ask us many questions, as he seemed to have his mind already made up on most points. He talked at some length upon the subject of iiuar cultivation. Ho cited the culti vation of cane In Queensland, saying that the work in the rield there, accord ing to h a iiuormation, was done by white labor. 'We called upon Secretary Gage and had a very interesting conversation with bonL and In his talk he referred to the tact thai it was contrary to policy to have large holdings of lands in the hands of private pa ties, and seemed quite sur- ! prised when we informed hitn that thU iv.13 not the case here, but that the large I holdings were by corporations, which have many stockholders. .These were the only official a who commented upon conditions here. "Speaking generally, I do not believe the:e will be much legislation devoted to Ilawaii.'at this set-sion. Senator Burrows and Congressman IJalzell both said to us that there was so much work to do at home lhat in their opinion there would be lit tl time to give to far away new territory. 1 gathered tnat tncre win oe a nard iik'U against any possiDie una changes in favor of Cuba, as the tobacco, sugar and beet men will be comb ned to tignt against any such concessions. The beet sugar men (ire very strong, and they will not give up their tight until the last ditch is taken. The general opinion seems to be that there will be a very hard struggle be fore the many reforms suggested by the president become Isw, as the senate has to be reckoned with, and there are mem bra who will oppose any radical action. I rtad the message of the president and I believe that he has not been correctly Informed as to local conditions, and that there will have to be much more Infor mation gathered on Hawaiian affairs be fore there Is any action by Congress." Among returning sugar men was i George A. Fa rchild of Kealla. Kauai, the manager of the Makee Sufar Com pany. Air. r a:rchiid, while in an t ran clsco, made all arrangements for the shipment of the sugar of that estate Irom Anahola direct to San Francisco, and the receipt there of all supplies di rect from the Coast markets. In regard to the outlook for better business condi tions Mr. I'airchild said: "I believe there will be little Coast BBtpney come Into stocks here very soon, bat that need not affect the Islands, as there Is the beat prospect that we will come out of the temporary dullness all right quite soon. All that Is to be done Is to reduce expenditures, and then we will work out In a short time. ' There seems to be a good prospect that thf-re Is to be a hard fitrht made upon the Cu ban BUaar nronosition. The beet BUgar 1 men and the tobacco men will fight any ; proposal to br!iiK sugar from Cuba into the Unit d State f ee, aa tobacco rmuA bei given the aatne advantage and thaT means much to the farmers of the South. , The general Impreseion is that the Chi nese exclusion law is to be re-enacted, nnd that there should be some arrange ment made for the protection of Ami ri j can Industries, which are threatened by ; reciprocity treaties with all countries, i ''There, is no question but that the ; President Is mis'nformod as to the con ditions in regard to lands Irre. as well j as the labor market, ilia remark that I white labor Is now cultivating the su- gars oi Queensland is not borne cut by i the statements which are received hero through the press of that country. The ' planters there, according to the trade papers, are in desperate straits, owing to the fact that Oriental labor has been I shut out. In response to demands of the Labor party, and the attempt to shut out the kanaka labor, on which the su- gar planters depend for the cultivation of their crops. There Is much pressure being brought to bear upon the Congress at Melbourne to permit the Introduction i of the Islanders, who have made the raising of sugar possible In tho past." .,.
