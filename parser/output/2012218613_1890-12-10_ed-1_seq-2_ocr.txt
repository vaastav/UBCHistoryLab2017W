If was a very easy waller to preach retrenchment and reform on tlie stump, but where to begin and how to brgin and where lo >id and how to end in reform are matters which require a great deal of wisdom. Mr. A. i>. Williaus, editor ! of the Greeuvilie Xetcs, writes as fol- ' lows to his oaner on this line: <4So j fa;* a* 1 can gather here, ihe mass of ihe members of both Houses are intellectually and iegi*latively iu chaes. They have come here on a platform of reform and retrenchment, but ontnidu of trie leaders nobody appear* to have a glimmet iug of a notion ot what i? to be riformed or where anything' in to be retrenched.

Perhapf, the best omen of Democratic victorr in 1892 was written by i>..4. xi v x icmucuc xittin&uu u i nui^ <*c,v> | . and submitted to Congress on last Monday. It is called the President's ?||> annual message, and it is really a Eplk message to tlie pe-pie telling them what dangers foreshadow thould we have a licpublioan administration in ! W, 1692. It would be a splendid scrap of paper to paste iu a scrap book and have handr on the stump. 9k 31?;st men would have credited Mr. Harrison with more wisdom than to 1 have attempted to defend the McKin- j W lov l?ill otm! tlii? FfliUral hill i Pyet he strongly endorses both and j earnestly prays Congros to pass the latter without the least possible delay, laying: atddc all minor legislation. We always thought tiie President a partisan and ordinarily would not be surprised at his endorsing partisan; legislation, but we thought he had j some political sagacity and shrewd- ' |v aess. He seems to learn nothing. Ex- ' pk perience, to him, is no teacher, how-!, ever recent may have been the oppor- i ; tunities of learning by exp?ri?nce. It j 1 T has been only about a month since the J : i>eor>le. on the McKinlev bill as an S L issu?, revolted against the Republican j IT, President seems to have dis- ? esrned nothing in tliut verdict. In , spite ef an overwhelming defeat lie i affirms and reaffirms his profound ' faith in the iniquitous bill. He ad- 1 "" ' mits the rise in prices since the passage ' of the recent tariff laws, b-tit make* a j po?r effort in tracing ?the cause. He j sar's'rt is due to speculation and super ' abitiidtftice of coined silver, and in fact j assign* numerous causes which will! adrhit of a great deal of theorizing", ' iint. ?r(?i>Tl)odv of common sense will i not swell for this cause after the : complicated fashion of President liar- ; l'isoii. When you tell a man of sound sense ! that a certain tariff duty will he put j on a given article, he knows that the ! manufactur. r of that article, in the j -.will itiiu* hl< tiricf* in ! ^ illlUU OlftlC.'j will ; M1.7V L- - proportion. Vou don't liave to go ! very far to tint] out the cause for it; j it lies right on the surface. But really President Harrison n nst i be a litt'e piqued, and in fact des- | perate He seeing anxious to make j his defeat in 1S92 an assured fact. ! He displays no ingenuity at all. He j dwells at considerable length on the j a? ricultural interest, doubtless in- | teuded as a bid for the votes of the j farmers, but he spoils the whole thing by telling them that the tariff will help them. He is profuse in his praise of Blaine's reciprocity scheme, but forgets all about the recent Mexican retaliation on account of the McKinley bill. The most charitable view that we can take of Mr. Harrison's message is that he is a man full of spmpathy. . He wants t? enter into the feelings of McKinley and a host of other defeated | Republican leaders and to act their | feelings out. That he mar fully sympathise with theun he must pass I through their experience?the experi- \ ence of defeat?and that be will do in 1 CMW IOC-. The South Carolina luivrr* ty. Governor Tillman in hi?t inaugural recommends a complete reorganization of tlie University >o us to convert it again into a college for the study of literature, cla*?ics and theoretical science. He recommends further that a permanent appropriation of $30,000 a > ear be granted, so as to take ttie College out of politics. Without any specific remark he leaves it to be inferred that he desires the reorganization to take place forthwith. iiik rsews axi> hfclulj) &as always opposed duplication of educational work, ami since Clemson College is a certainty itt the near future, it sties uo need lor the name kind of work at Columbia and at Fort Hill.

Still more important is i; tlut the University be not torn asunder in the midnt ot the e?fcion. At lca?t three months of the scholastic >ear will haT? elapsed tit fore anr change can be made, during which term, instructor* and >tudent?s will have gotten well under way with the years work. To apply th? knife at thb time would ! only be-to throw instructors out of employment who have been brought there by iiv? State under & sort ot implied contract, aud who theiaselres b.v a by-law are prohibited from leaving of their owa accord without ample notice, who would be thrown out at a time when there is no opportunity for new engagements eUewhere, and would thus be rutde to suffer loss in a maniier that no s*oud citizen of the Mare thai* this, quite a number of young' men have been engaged for periodi of from one to three rears in pursuing technical courses of study.

WHAT IS CrDACIII A It is that impurity in tlio blood, which, accumulating in the glands ol the neck, produces unsightly lumps or swellings; which causes painful running sores on the arms, legs, or feet; which devclopes ulccrs in the eyes, ears, or nose, often causing blindness or deafness; which is the origin of pimples, cancerous growths, or the many other manifestations usually ascribcd to "humors;" which, fastening upon the lungs, causes consumption and death. Being the most ancient, it is the most general of all diseases or affections, for yery few persons aro entirely free from it. HowCan AlfDCn It Be V/VntK^ | By taking Hood's Sarsaparilla, which, by the remarkable cures it has accomplished, often when other medicines have failed, has proven itself to be ^.potent and peculiar medicine for this disease. Some of . these cures are really wonderful. If you suffer from scrofula, be sure to try Hood's Sarsaparilla. " My daughter Mary was afflicted with scrofulous sore neck from the time she was 22 months old till sXs became six years of age. Lumps formed in her neck, and one of them after growing to the size of a pigeon's egg, became a running sore for over three years. We gave her Hood's Sarsaparilla, when the lump and i oil i Q di.<U 1 appeared, and now she seems to be & healthy child." J. S. Caklile, Nauright, N. J. N. B.
