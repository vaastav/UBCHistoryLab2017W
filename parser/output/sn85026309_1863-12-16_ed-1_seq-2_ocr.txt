It Is not in the interest of any party, nor is it meant to be iden tified with the interest of any party, because it will not be fettered. It will not be Neutral for that means tiaic-scrving timidity. It will hare Try distinct opinions on all public questions connected with government, whether Union, Boats, or County : and on the expression of opin ions it will have but one guide, a strict adher ence to law. It will support the Constitution and ths Laws, without regard to platforais or to party dogmas. Congress. Cdb this head we shall give the actual do ings of Congress on the necessary business of the country. Mere partizan propositions to make what is called "a record," and intended for use in the next election, will be noticed only so far as necessary to show the temper and feellDg of the body. The Srst week ef a new Congress is of necessity consumed in the organization of committees. It is also the week in which members make propositions show ing the topics of the last election, r pre pare topics for the next. In the Senate, Mr. Lane, of Indiana, hastened to introduce t bill to repeal the 5300 exemption clause in the conscrip tion act. This in a weak yielding to the unwise clamor which was made against the law as unjust to poor men. If that clause be repealed, none but rich men can have substitutes. The law itaelf is a nullity, but while it teems to stand, that clause should remain in it. Another proposition very right in it self, to abolish the distinction between married men under thirty-five, and those over thirty-five, was also made. That will strike a large class of patriots who are now in favor of sending out their younger brethern, if negroes cannot be bad. Mr. Sumner was favored with a peti tien from some students in a theological teminarff, praying Congress to abolish slavery throughout the Union. Senator Hale made a proposition to prohibit sla very except by contract. And an odd member or two in the House, from the great Northwest Pocket, made like move ments. These gentlemen have not read Mr. Lincoln's papers, in which he says that Congreps have no power over slavery in the States, and the power belongs to him as a military necessity. They have either forgot what he said, or they must have doubts about it. The next thing in order is to da the holidays. Congress. The President's Message. The President's Message at the open ing of the present Congress makes it clear that the war is not to end until after the next Presidential election. It will not comport with the interest of the Destruc tives to permit those States to cast a pos itive vote in that election, and the party drivers will endeavor to find way not to count them as States, although Mr. Lincoln has always maintained that the secession is a nullity, and that the States are still in the Union, as they undoubt edly are. It has bean hoped that at some fav t able crisis in the rebellion, when the South must see that their cause was becoming hopeless, that the President would issue a proclamation of general forgiveness, and hold out to them a help ing hand for their return ; and he had promised as much in his letter to Fer nando Wood. He has now issued a proc lamation which he calls an offer of Par don, but it is done in such a sort as to ensure its failure. If Mr. Lincoln were 'not a Kentuckiaa he might possibly be presumed not to know any better; bat he knows well that the proclamation is so shaped as to ensure its falling a dead letter, and worse than that: it must fall as a crushing blow to all the hopes that any of them might have of returning peace. His Edict of Emancipation which was meant to get up insurrections and scare the army home to protect their fire sides, utterly failed in that, and only in creased the force of their army by in creasing the numbers in service and ad ding to the spirit of desperation. This proclamation will serve the same purpose, of makiog the people more desperate. This proclamation will everywhere be talked of by the Combination as an offer . of pardon if they will only take the oath of allegiance; and they will never allude to the conditions of spoliation and abase ment with which it is coupled, nor of the exclusion of all the officers from the rank of colonel upwards, and of all who may have served in their Congress the very men of all others whose influence should have been secured in favor of return, and not against return. Unless something shall yet take place, now utterly unfor seen, and without our help, and the Southern power break down from cheer exhaustion, this war can have no end during all next year. Free Labor and Cotton. Febsoxs who never saw a cottcn plan tation in their lives, are quite ready to argue and show that free labor would be the cheapest and more profitable to the master. This class of economists qnd philanthropists have soiae foretaste of. 1 what the poor negroes will be subject to in a competition with a sharking white man who has no interest in the negroe's life. The United States have taken posses sion of numerous plantations along the Mississippi, which have been leased out to persons whotre cultivating them, and raising cotton. There are more than fifty of these plantations under the care of commissioners. A person whom the New York Evening Post pronounces per fectlyj trustworthy, has communicated these facts to that paper, and pronounces " the management of these plantations a piece of unmitigated villainy," and that the " negroes have suffered more priva tions in this pretended state of freedom than they ever did before." "By the terms of the contract with the commis sioners the negro is to be paid five dol lars per month for women, and seven dollars for men ; they are to be furnished with certain rations, and with clothing, the value of which is to be taker out of wages due them." Now the notion of hireing field hands by the month was never heard of at the South. They were always hired by the year, at wages not less than one hundred and fifty dollars a year and found iB everything. This hiring of men at seven dollars a month and charge them with clothing out of that, and turn them off at pleasure, is a specimen of proclamation philanthropy and government justice. The writer goes on to say that " the care which these people have received is amply shown by one look at the planta tion grave yards, in any one of which can be found from twenty to two hundred graves of the victims of this humane sys tem. The tenns of the contract are all in favor of the lessee; but even these have not been complied with, and the intention of the lessee seems to be to absorb all the negroes wages in the clo thing and rations furnished him at ad vanced prices. At the end of the year he will find himself without means, de pendent on himself, with bitter recollec tions of the past and gloomy forebodings of the future." These task-masters- of freedom- are no doubt loyal is the government sense, and even np to the standard of a Major General's requirements, and can certify to the great profits of the system. To those who do not know the charac ter of the New Ycrk Evening Post, it is well to say that it maintained anti-slavery opinions in days when it was not profita ble, as it is now with others. David Tod and $5,000. We couple these word3 to show with what facility usurpation is going on all round us without any notice taken of it ; which shows that in these days no mat ter what is done by persons "drest in brief authority," it is all fight The Governor of Ohio has nothing whatever to do with the Ohio Penitentiary, which is by law placed under the care of Direc tors of the Penitentiary, and they ap point a Warden. It is for the reception and discipline of persons sent to it under the sentence of the Ohio courts, and by permission of the State the Government of the United States may also use it for convicta. Yet when John Morgan and his men were captured, the Governor lent the Penitentiary, or a part of it, as a military prison. In a publication made by the Governor, he stated that these prisoners were under military keeping of the United States. Now when Mor gan has escaped, Mr. Tod offers a reward of $5,000 for his recapture. It is not likely that this proffer will come to a practical test, and it may prove only an ornamental piece of public zeal. But when the Governor did it he must nave had some notion of the purse from which the money was to- come. Was it from his own, or from the Ohio treasury? If from the latter, under what authority was it done? Or was it to come from the United StateB? and if so has he a gen eral power to act as Deputy President in "these headquarters"? His Excel lency's late exposition of the misunder standing between the Warden and Gen eral Mason, as to who had Morgan, shows an interesting state of precision in the con duct of public matters, and next in im portance to that other question of " who has got Morgan now?" The President in his message to Con gress has,. noticed some of the abuses which have at times grown out of our lax system of naturalization, and names this one: that persons have at times sought to be naturalized as citizens of the United States, apparently for the purpose of evading certain duties to their own government, and after gaining their American letters have gone to reside abroad entirely, and when it suited them, claimed American protection. The Pres ident suggests that a law be passed de claring that after continued residence abroad by an American citizen for a pre scribed period, he should lose his right to claim protection. Without any aid from Congress, pub lic opinion has corrected the error into which our nation had fallen in regard to naturalized foreigners. In the case of Kozta, who was forcibly rescued from the deck of an Austrian vessel, in the harbor of Smyrna, and who had never been naturalized at all, but had only de clared his intention, our people made a hero of Ingraharo, when he really deserv ed punishment and dismissal. A naturalized foreigner takes on him self an additional citizenship, and does not lose his first one, unless his nation so provides. While he remains in his adop ted country he is entitled to all the rights of a citizen, and all the protection of a citizen. But if he chooses to return to his own country, and oontinues to reside there, the true" inference is that he is re remittcd to his elder right, and that he returned home with that intent, if he became resident. The language used by the President would leave it ' in doubt whether he did not intend to advise the same rule for a natural born citizen also; bnt that cannot lawfully be done. A man cannot be expatriated without his own consent and act. Unconditional. That is the genuine phrase to teat loy al mon by an unconditional Union man, without an if or a bat. But it is like some kinds of public benevolence it is not to cost the loyal propagator any restraint. He is for the Union, on con ditier that slavery is abolished. Mr. Free Speech is for the return of all the States, provided they are made free States, with the army guarding the polls, aud keeping off the bad voters. Mr. Lincoln is in favor of pardoning all rebels of a common kind, cn condition that they swear to believe in all bis doings and proclamations. Mr. Lincoln is in favor of guaranteeing republican government to all the rebel States, on condition that one tenth of the people are willing to adopt hie plan, and he will keep down the other nine tenths. This unconditional doctrine is like patent medicine made to be advertised and sold the inventors never take it themselves. Whiskey Gambling. It has been proposed or suggested in some report from the revenue officers to Congress, that a higher duty should be laid on whiskey. This increase has been variously reported by telegraph as an in crease of sixty per cent, on the present duty, and as an increase to sixty cents a gallon. Straightway the gamblers, who call themselves operators, set to work to have a good stock on band when the law shalf pass, which they assume as certain. The price of whiskey has gone up on these chance. The distillers also set to work to have a large stock on which they have paid' a duty of only twenty cents a gallon, and so they bid high for corn, till it has reached one dollar a bushel in this market. Of course this grinds the poor, but they must not complain. The spec ulator must have hiB gain, and his excite ment, and enjoy the glory of being a shrewd operator. It is to be hoped that Congress will at once raise the duty to forty cents a gallon, and make it apply to all already made after the first day of December, that the public may bag the gain of the whiskey-gamblers' skill. "Great War Meeting at Cincinnati. Such is the heading in the Cincinnati papers of a meeting about to be held under the call of leading men. But in stead of a cheering cry to arms, and a valiant offei of service by swelling patri ots, it is a meeting to avoid the draft to subscribe money for the purchase of volunteers ! This is an approved method, and has been tried in Cincinnati on a former occasion, when the liberal sub scribers got back their money from the county treasury in six per cent, bonds! Nothing like a vigorous prosecution of the war, and every man taking his turn ! In Richmond good whiskey sells for $5,000 a barrel, rebel money. An infe rior article can be had for 52.000.

In that untried and utter solitude, then, what can there be for us but the pulsation of that assur ance " I am not alone, because the Father is with me." Home of ths Working Man.

Au army of the Cumberland cor respondent of a New York paper says: It is surprising the hold General Buell has on the affections and confidence of this army. Many officers assert that if he had been left in command our progress might hare seemed slower, but to-day we would have been nearer Atlanta, and have no Chickamauga's on our record. They assert that so long as Resecrans followed the plans of Buell he was successful, but the moment he departed from these, defeat began to be his fate. His re turn to the important command here would be hailed with delight, and would create more enthusiasm than any event of the past month. It is rumored that he will come here and be assigned to General Grant as chief of staff. Let toe Stomach have its Craving. In the diseases produced by bad food, such as scorbutic dysentery and diarrhoea, the ro dent's stomach often craves and digests things some of which certainly would be laid down in no dietary that ever was invented for the sick, and especialy not for such sick. These are fruit, pickles, jams, ginger-bread, fat of ham or bacon, suet, ehc.se, butter, milk. These cases I have seen, not by ones, nor by tens, but by hundreds'. And the patient's stomach was right, and the book was wrong. The articles craved for, in these cases, might have been principally arragned under the two head of fat and vegetable acids. There is often a marked difference between men and women in this matter of sick-feeding. Wo men's digestion is generally slower. Florence Nightingale. Bauimore, Dec. 13.
