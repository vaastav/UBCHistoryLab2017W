Samavr of That Prolix Docuaant. In method -and spirit, and especially in its careful study of the department re- ports, on which it is largely based, Mr. Cleveland's second general message re scinbles the one sent to Congress a year go- It opens, according to custom, with a review of.lnternatlonal affairs. Here the two great subjects of importance are the fishery dispute and the Cutting case. The former is still unsettled, and the President, while desiring friendly rela tions with the Dominion, finds such re latlons threatened by ; the action of Its . officials toward our fishermen. Ho makes no mention of the authority given to him lost summer to check Ihis action by a retaliatory proclamation. Tho year's ne gotiations at London have thus far resul ted in nothing, but hopes are held out of reaching an acceptable conclusion before the end of the session. Meanwhile the correspondence on the subject is to be laid before Congress. As to the Cutting case, the President contents himself with protesting against tho doctrine that although Mr. Cutting's offence was committed on our soil, yet ho became subject to punishment by Mexi can laws, when found in that country, as the offence has been 'committed aguinst a Mexican citizen. lie hope s that Mexi-' co will abandon her position, becauso the two republics should be good friends, and American capital and enterprise, flowing into Mexico, ask security of person and property. Ho recommends legislation to carry out the Reciprocity Convention of 1S03 with Mexico, and is going to open negotiations for an en larged treaty of commerce. With Hawaii, as an outpost of Ameri can commerce, our relations, says the President, ought to be strengthened. The treaty, now terminable on a year's notico, ought to bo extended for a further term of seven yea's, while tho autonomy of tho islands should bo maintained and telegraph communication established be tween them and us. The President regrets the 111 treatment of the Chinese on the Pacific const, and says that China will meet us half way in limiting the emigration of her subjects, while protecting those who are now here. . Good results are hoped from the recent changes In organic law bringing Panama directly under tlie ad ministration of .Bo gota. Chill has not yet provided for tho payment of the claims of our country men. Liberia the President regards as nn offshoot of our political system, enti tled to our support In maintaining her Independence, although a formal pro tectorate would be against our policy. , He proposes to give her some "smull ves sel, no longer lounu adequate to our needs," for protecting her coastwise rev enues. Consul Greenehaum has been re called for his "ovcrzcalous", stroke in declaring a protectorate over Samoa and King Malioton. Tho Netherlands com plain thnt our tariff specially discrimi nates against the tobacco of the Dutch East Indies. Spain has rclinqulnhed her discrimination acalnst our merchant ves sels in she Antilles, and now displays a incnuiy commercial spirit, .Dir. uox will be glad to hear that the improved treat mcut of American missionaries in Tur key is duo to his exertions. Venezuela still withholds her ratification of the Claims Convention of 1880. A revision of legislation on citizenship and extradition Is asked, with a bureau for the registration of naturalized citi zens, and a law for the immediato dis- charge from ctiBtody of persons commit ted for extradition where the President thinks the surrender should not bo made. The copyright question is commended to Congress and also the abolition of the discrimination now made by the tariff in favor of the works of American artists. Attention is asked to Secretary Bayard's proposed rearrangement of tho diplomat ic and consular salaries, and much appre ciation is expressed of the value of the consular reports which the State Depart ment prints, i '. ii ," Turning to financial affairs, the Presi dent says tho ordinary receipts of the last fiscal year wore $13,749,020,68 above those of tha year preceding; tho ordinary expenses, 417,788,707 less; the surplus left in the Treasury, $93,950,588,00, as . against $03,403,771,27 the previous year, being an increase of $30,492,815.27. The estimated surplus at the end of the cur rent expenses is abont $90,000,000. Tho President urges a reduction of the reve nues by so modifying the tariff as to "cheapen tho price of the necessaries of life and give freer entrance to such Im ported materials as by American labor may be manufactured" Into marketable goods. Tho Agriculturist, he says, pays "an unnatural profit, which, by the ac tion of the Government, Is given to tho mnPA fnvrnl MumifotliiM..1 1. In il.n compulsory coinage of silver, the Presi dent repeats his last year's recommenda tion of its suspension. He advises the appointment of an additional Federal .Tmiiro. In the Southern District of New York, .where customs suits have greatly nccumuluicd... . .... Of rucrttnfy 'Einlicott's recommenda tions he Hpeciall' sanctions those ' rela ting to eut dufi-nse,' and for requiring ' iivmiiuuiiimg, liuu those in tne nnvy, up ou the promotion of army ofllcers. A short summary of Secretary Whitney's report is given, wun a somewnat guarded approval of its project for securing Ameri can armor and gun steel. The President favors an extension of the free delivery service, anu an appropriation lor lncreas ed postal services to the Argentine Re public and Brazil, though not as "a grunt or suUBiuy. tie commends tho sug gi stlons of the Attorney Gcueral as t whole, und, particularly the one to estate litsh a penitentiary for prisoners senlen, cod In Luitcd States courts. Tho costof erecting and maintaining It would he partly offset, he says, by saving the sums paid to State Institutions, and by "the manufacture, of such articles as wore noeded for u&e by tho Government. The President repeats his recoinmen uaiion oi a commission oi three nrmy olllcers and throe civilllans, as 'auxiliary io mo present ' system oi muian agents, The allotment, of Indian lands In several ty Is also favored. The repeal of the Preemption and Timber Culture acts and the repeal or amendment of the Home stead and the Desert Land laws are re- commonded. The subject of ; pcnslsns Is discussed at. length, but rather vague ly. There soems, however, to be an in dication of an important purpose to oh ject to pensions granted "upon any other .grounds than actual service and injury te iHaamtt (nn iwfA In an r K iAlnS ' ' ut uinc-aoo mtta; iu ttuiu nut v ivv. , The Patent Office Is busy and prosper ous. as to the union x'acitic s inueot edness, the.

The amount would be about fl.291,718, but he thinks that a laree part of It would not be called for. The needs of the District of Columbia round cut the very long message, ' Mrs. Jones, how Is your health this morning? Thank you, madam much Im proved. I bought a bottle of Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup last night, and, after the first dose, my cough was checked, I slept well, and have not coughed once this morning.

WONDERFUL REMEDY. Whit can be Dona with an Article of .Merit in the band of Progres f slve Slen. A Whole pago of this issue of tha Cour- kit is occumed by the advertisement of llifi greatest blond purifier that has ever ocen-.kuuwu. lbe medicine has-been nmd for over fifty years in Georgia, but has j'only within the last ten ycors been prominently brought to the notice of the puttie, ina linn which manufactures tul aicrtic.lne Is the largest drug estab lishment in the South, and unites with an immense capital, the most correct und successful business methods, thoroughly protecting all whs- trade with them, nnd giving every one, from the smallest deal er to the largest houses, fair profits on their goods. Their success and tho ex tent of their business can better bo ap preciated by a knowledge of the fact that their annual sales in Evansvlllo reach ninny thousands of dollars, and they ad vertise this season only In the Courier and the Public. Such success could only be attained with a thoroughly reliable remedy, and this fact almost makes it unnecessary to say a word In its favor, further than the testimonials which will be seen to-day on the third page of the Couritr. They are only a few selected from thousands which have been received. If any sufferer in Evansvile with blood trouble ot any Kind has not yet tried -this wonderful remedy, he should not. allow another day to pass over his head before giving It a trial. . it will certainly do all that is claimed for H.EcantvilU (Ind.), Kiourur, tscpt. su, itsso.
