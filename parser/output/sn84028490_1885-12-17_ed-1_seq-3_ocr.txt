The eastern Demoorats as well as the KeptihiloaiiH pmIhi the menage highly, but Home Uiimocrats think It leans too miii'li to Huudall's notions on the tariff.

Mr. Hill says that he does not agree Willi the President on stiver. Mayoh Giucs has sued Joe Pullf zr. of the World, for $50,000, Pulitzer says ho will prove every word he said of Grace, In which event It will go hard with the Mayor, one of the charges being that he wai.Ward'i partner and shar d In his rascalities, or words to .that e fleet. Iu this oonneotlon the fol lowing Incident Is related by a Chloago paper: Once, long ago, the late Senator "Mat" Carpenter, of Wisconsin, felt In Jiired by some publication In a Chicago paper, and In the beat of tils anger en tared suit for rousing damages.. The proprietor of the paper, on receiving notice of the suit, wrote: "Hon. Mat, U Carpenter DiMir Sir: Don't make a fool of yourself. Yours, eto." To whloh the Hntiator, having somewhat cooled off, promptly replied: "Dear Sir: I won't. Yours, eto," Ttii-t correspondence Is com mended to the consideration, of the Nhw York World and Mayor Grace. Something like It would suit their pres eti( ouie t'Xiclly. i . 1 ; Hkchktahy Lamar, ex-Confedcrate as he l, recognizes as fully as any ono could desire, tho Justice of pensions to I'nlon soldiers, and make one point In their si pnort that Is as novel astt Is forcible. "The amount of money paid a p union," he says, "do"S not equal the iiiiinuut uf Interest paid upon the public debt Incurred during the war. Hulling an tho premium paid to thono who contributed the money exceeds that paid to the defenders of the country, think tho complaint of exc-wlve pen hJouh Is not welt founded." Still the Secretary Is determined to eradlcalo the alum" of Illegal and flotltlous names on the peuulun rolU, and says that In two iigxtio es alone more than a thousand names have been stricken from the rolls i i Kmkiihun and Curly lo corresponded greut deal, and It was understood be t ween them that the former should have the custody and disposal of the corre spondence when It was Qnlshed. The letters will be published this week by Messrs, Tlcknor A Co., llonton.

VOICE OF THE TRUE LEADER. How the pigmies dwindle into still smaller insignificance when the giant speaks!

Kven those who may dissent from Mr. Tll deu's conclusion mint concede the force of his arguments, To us both seem sound, Hut we desire now not so much to dismiss the que-ulou to which hl-i letter relates, as to re'ognlza the potency of the voice that speaks from Greyhtone to the (rrent body of the Democratic party. ,N, Y, Sun. HaMoMMaaHMBM Tim President rap the United States District Attorneys over the knuckles for the old corrupt practice, dating back to and probably beyond tin time of Lin oolu's D. strict Attorneys, of extorting money from the Government In the shape of "constructive tuMoage," He also overh iiils the Marshals and District Attorneys for "encouraging frivolous proiecutious, arresting people on petty charge of crime," and renortlng to oth er trick to "earn mileage and other foes."

Know- ng about as much of the silver question as the ma trlty of the people who spout over It. we have nothing to say of the above opinion of the President, and don't 'know whether he I right or wrong.

Pukmdknt Cuvkund reminds the railroads which have received "princely grants and subsidies" that public Indig nation has been aroused and suspicion engendered only beoatise It lias been charged that these donations from the people have been diverted to private gain and oorrupt uses, He reminds the cor porations that ths uatlou "does not be grudge Its generosity, but abhors pecula tion aud fraud," and that the only way to revive the favorable regard of the people for those great corporations Is by honest, upright aud liberal action on the part of the latter.
