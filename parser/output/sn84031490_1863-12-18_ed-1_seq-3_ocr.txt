Is a report received at tbc Adju tant General’s office from a flag of truce par ty who met the rebel Marmadnke some.time ago, at Washington, in Hcmstead county, In the southwestern portion of Arkansas, where Marmcduke was then camped with a huge cavalry force. He had with him Shelby, Qnantrel, Kitchell, Coffee and other Missouri guerilla leaders, and remarked that they would be heard from in a quarter least - ex pected before long. The officer learned on the way to Washington that a raid into Mis souri through flic Indian country and KWaa* was contemplated, and that the rebels viewed with satisfaction the congratulations ex changed in this State that a reign of peace and freedom from guerillas, had jcommenced. Probably they hoped that this delusion might be followed by a withdrawal of our troops from various points in the State, so as to throw open an additional section of territo ry to guerilla raids. Marmaduko himself wm probably obey the orders of Price, who is somewhere south of the Red River, await ing ad opportunity to join with Kirby Smith and strike a blow at the Federal power In Ar kansas. The raid will bo undertaken, if at all ear nest, under command of Shelby and Qoan trcl, and their game will bo to go to the west of Fort Smith, so os to avoid a collision with our cavalry. It may turn out, however, that Jlanuaduke will have to risk a fight or foot race, and sooner than he expected, as Gen. McNeil had a huge force of cavalry following the track of the rebel, during the last week iu November, with orders to go to the Red River. A large number of rebels arc dally taking tbe oatli of allegiance in tbc interior, and although that act does not restore them to the right of citizenship, it will have a good moral effect in discouraging the ignorant wretches who join the bushwhackers' during the summer months, and ore at the bottom of all tbc outrages on Union families in ex posed localities. ‘When the order was issued eighteen months aso to enroll all able-bodied persons for service in the enrolled militia, excepting those avowedly disloyal, there was a rush in many of the interior towns to be enrolled as disloyal, in order to escape what was then supposed to be the pending draft. Hundreds confessed their sympathies for the rebels who would now gladly retract that avowal if they could. Many of them did tacitly admit their error by taking the oath ol loyalty required by the State Conven tion, and cast their suffrages * for the . Conservativesat the lost election. TV6 hear of so many ch&ngcs of heart throughout the country, that it is suggested our rebel sym pathizers do not regard the government of Gov. Gamble and Gen. Schofield such a very had government, after all—for rebels—in' which opinion the Kadi cal Union men most heartily concur. ApnposoT Gen. Schofield: It is rather sin gular that our advices from Washington rep resent an impression gaining ground there that Gen. Schofield is acceptable to the Radi cals of Missouri, on account of what he has recently done concerning the enlistment of negroes. This is indeed news. No such sen-: timent exists in the Radical party here, and uo leading or prominent Radical has ever given voice to such a remark about Gen. Schofield. If such a representation has been made, it is bogns, and suggests a trick on the part of friends of Gen. Schofield to mis lead the Senate when that body* is called upon to reject or confirm that officer’s nomination. Regarding the enlistment of negroes, it has flourished in gpitp of Gen. Schofield, and would have gone on without his order if his hands had been tied. Hisaction is altogether negative. Keeping his hands off is the only boon asked of him. There are men here who arc sufficiently insane to believe that under Gen. Curtis or Bcu Butler thrice as many ne groes would be enlisted into the military sendee of the Government as there will dur ing Gen. Schofield’s term. The enlistment of negroes Is getting to he an important matter, cob W. A. Piloofthe Sod Missouri volunteers, who has the matter in charge at present, reports the arrival of 525 colorcdrccmits from Dec. 6 to Dee. 1L A majority came from Boonvilh*. One party of eighty-nine (80) arrived, on '-’ridoy night from Lexington and forty-*** t-H) from Pilot Knob. The conscrvati , .J* in the interior finding that the progrea Tnegro re cruiting was steady and sure In spite of their efforts,“have suddenly become clamorous for its success in order to relieve their counties of a draft. It is claimed that Boone connty has already filled her quota under all calls but tbe last, by sending negroes to the recruiting officers. Among tbe slaves who enlisted last week were all tbc males between seven teen and fifty, from the plantations of Hon. James S. Rollins, one of the bitterest oppo nents of the negro arming policy. Tbe total number received at Benton Barracks since the recruiting commenced, is over one thous and. A second regiment la now being filled up.’ Though Gov. Gamble not many months ago declined having anything to do with issuing commissions to officers of negro reg iments. it is believed he will yet wheel info line. With negro guards on duty at his head- Snorters, the Governor might as well come own from his high horse now as at some later day. The blow given to speculators in hay by tbc prompt action of the Chief Quartermas ter of the West, has been endorsed by all right-minded, loyal citizens. The idea held out by the extortionists, that no hay would come to market in the face of such an order, has not been realized. Last week the receipts were upwards of 3,000 bales, and the whole sale prices ranged from S2O to $29 per ton of 2,000 pounds. This is equivalent to $35 per ton for the euormoos lots required by the Quartermaster, and fully justifies the step ta ken by that officer. As yctuooctualimpress ment has been resorted to, and the * receipts mentioned are entirely voluntary on the part of shippers. The effect of this action of the Government agents has been excellent upon articles required for tbe army. Had the com binotion to force up the price of hay been ’successful, there would have been combina tions on oats, com and provisions. Breaking down tbc first attempt of this character is one of the luckiest strokes which has oc curred for Uncle Sam since tbe war com menced. The railroad strife stQl agitates the Legis lature. Fault is found with the St Louis delegation (with few exceptions) for appear ing to favor the sell-out policy in opposition to'the wishes of the tax-payers and q majori ty of our citizens. A country member has dubbed them the “bought out” party, but Hits is slander. It is charged - that they arc trying to convert this question of selling tbe railroads Into a radical issue, which is manifestly absurd, as many of tbc most honorable and trusted Radicals in this chy, commencing with Mayor Filley and the radical part of the Common Council, are op posed to the sale. As well make the building of ascwerinapublicstrccta party issue as thfa. Indeed, in some respects tbe railroad strife in the Legislature' has more of a per sonal character than anything else. The di rectors are abused, and Mr. Samuel Hallett, the banker who appears to help the direct ors. Is infamously abused, as if their connec tion with the matter settled tbe question of policy involved; while on the other hand Gen. Fremont Is abused, and all his associ ates likewise, which style of argument forms no valid objection to the question of sale. The State election result is still in doubt, because the State canvassers have made no official declaration of the result, and no ccr tificatcsof election have been issued. Thcrcis hardly a question, however, that tbc Conser vative candidates win receive the certificates, and the delay is more for theatrical effect than to settle any disputes in the returns. When this decision is officially promulgated, it is supposed that the Radical candidates will bring the matter before the State Senate, and servo notice on their rivals of an inten tion to prosecute tbc contest be fore that body. Just now there is nothing tangible to contest, and untU there is, nothing more will bo done. The disfranchisement of our soldiers will be thoroughly ventilated when the cause comes to trial. ■' About tbe meanest thing of the season is the attempt made bv onr cx-Scnator, Eobert \Tilson, to get Us mileage from the Senate, previous to the arrival of B. Gratz Brown in Washington. Better things were expected of Mr. Wilson. Be had the reputation of being honest at least, but this petty meanness has disgraced bim at home eternally. ■ Captain John Carpenter, of company C, 2d Arkansas loval cavalry, has been convicted of persuading hi% company to tun away, and of burning public stores unnecessarily during Shelby’s raid into tbe Southwest. His sen tence is that he shall refund tbe value of the stores destroyed, and ho dishonorably dis missed from the service. A few instances of severity like this would stop the practice of such cowardice altogether. The city is so overrun with refugees and stragglers that the Mayor has vetoed an ord inance to take a census of our population, on the ground that no fair enumeration of the actual residents of the city con be made at S resent The regular municipal census is to e taken a yea? hence, in accordance with a provision of the charter. A storm has prevailed since Saturdaynight, and snow fell lost night r, Cavalry Bureau. Tbe Farewell Order of Gen. Bra"g~ Hardee’s General Order. Tbe following is Gen. Bragg’s farewell or der to his army: Upon renewed application to the President, his concent has been obtained for tbe relinquishment of the command of this army. It is accordingly transferred to Lieut. General Harden, The announcement of this separation is made with nniclgned regret. An association of more Gian two years, which bind together a commander and bis tmstedtroops, can notbc severed without deep emotion. For a common cause, dangers shared on many hard-foneht fields hare cemented bonds which time can never impair. Tbe circum stances which render this step proper will be ap preciated by every good soldier and true patriot. The last appeal the General has to make to the gallant army which has so long nobly sustained him, is to give bis successor that cordial and generous support so essential to the success of your arms. In that successor you have a veteran whoso brilliant reputation you have aid ed to achieve. To the officers of my general staff, who have so long zealously and successfully strug gled against serious difficulties to support the army and myself, is duo, in a great degree, what little success and fame we have achieved. Bidding them and the army on-affectionate farewell, they hare the blessing* and prayers nf a cratefnl friend. Braxton Bragg. • On assuming command. Lieutenant General Hardee issued the following general order: Soldiers of the Army of Tennessee: General Bragg having been relieved from duty with the snny, the command has devolved upon me. Tbo eteadv courage, the unsullied patriot ism of the distinguished leader who has shared your fortunes for more than a year, will long bo remembered by tills army and the country be Fenrcd so web.

EUROPE. Napoleon’s Letter to Queen Victoria. EARL RUSSELL’S LETTER ANNOUNC ING ENGLAND’S REFUSAL. Daath of lord Elgin-The War in Japan. The foreign mails bring the full test of the diplomatic correspondence between France and England, in relation to the Euro pean Congress, the following is NAPOLEON’S LETTER TO QUERN VICTORIA. “Madam, mr Sister: In face of tbe events - which daily arise nod press themselves on atten tion I deem it Indispensable to impart my whole thought to the sovereigns to whom the destiny of nations is confided. ■ , “ On all occasions when great convulsions have shaken the foundations and deranged the limits of states, solemn compacts have followed to reduce to order the new elements, and to recognise, while revising them, the changes that have been effected. “Such was the object of the Treaty-of .West phalia in tbe seventeenth century, and of the Ne gotiations of Vienna in 1815.

ENGLAND’S REFUSAL. On the 25th of November, the refusal of England to take part in the Congress was of ficially announced, os follows: Foreign Omcr, November 23. Mr Lord : Her Majesty’s government have re ceived from the Marquis of Cadorc the copy of a dit-patch addressed to him by MJ)ronyaDeL’Hnyg. in answer to my dispatch to your Excellency oi the 13th instant. Her Majesty’s government bav in" obtained an answer to the inquiries they made, will not any longer delay giving a definite reply to the invitation addressed by the Emperor of the French to her Majesty the Queen, to take part in a Congress of the European powers to be assem bled at Paris. I Inclose a copy of the Emperor’s letter of invi tation to the Queen, which is similar to oncwhlch has already appeared in the Monitor, addressed to tho German Confederation. Her Majesty’s gov ernment fully recognize in this step, the desire of* the Emperor of the French to pnt an end to the disquietude which affects several parts of Europe, and to establish the general peace on foundations more solid than those which, in h!s oplnlon.it now rests. The Emperor declares that France Is disin terested In this question; that he, for his part, seeks no aggrandizement, and that the interests to be Bccnredore those, not ofFrance, bnt of Europe. Her Majesty's government may also declare that Great Britain is disinterested in this matter, that she seeks no aggrandizement, and that she has only to counsel ' moderation and peace. But France and Great Britain being thus disinter ested themselves, are bound to consider what is tbo position, and what, in a Congress, will bo tho probable conduct of Powers who may-be called upon to make sacrifice of territory or of prc-cml cence and moral strength. It would he little to the purpose to say on this occasion, anything more of the Treaties of 1813. Practically, the Emperor of the French admits the binding forte of many portions of those treaties, and her Majesty's Government as readily allow that some portions of them have been modified or disregarded, and that other portions arc now me nacedor called in question. Her Majesty's Gov ernment understand from the explanations given by M. Dronyn do L'lluys that, in tbo opinion of the Government of the Emperor, it Is obvious to every one that there are several questions not hitherto solved, which may here disturbed Europe. OI this nature ore the following: “ Must the conflict in Poland bo still further pro longed? Is Denmark to be at war with Germany, nntfliave the powers which formerly took a partin the discussion of this question become indifferent to it ? Must anarchy continue in the Dannblan Principalities, and thus at any moment tend to re open the questioned the East? Must Italy and Austria always remain in presence of each other in a hostile attitude? Mast the occupation oi Borne by French troops be prolonged for a definite time ? Tbe Emj»eror’sgovernment pul a furtaerques ’tloa: “ Must we, -without having made new attempts at conciliation, renounce the hope of lightening the burdens imposed upon the nations of Europe bv excessive annaments kept up by the reelin'* cf mutual distort ? These, no doubt, ore theprtucl pol questions which either disturb or threaten the peace of Europe; bnt there ia a further ouestlon which her Majesty's government consider'to lie at the bottom of this whole matter, and that is the following: Is a general Congress of-European States likely to furnish a peaceful solution of the various mat* ten in dispute ? r This, indeed, Isthc question which it behoves the Governments of the different States to consid er seriously and attentively. Thercappcars to her Majesty's Government to be one main consideration which mast lead them to their conclusion. After tho war which deso lated Germany from ICI9 to 1619, and after tho successive wars which afflicted the* continent of Europe from 1793 to 1615, It was possible to dis tribute territories and to define rights by a Con gress, because the nations of Enrope were tired of the slaughter and exhaustion by the hardens of war, and because the Powers who met In Con gress bad bythc circumstances of the time, the means of carrying their decisions and arrange ments into efivet. Bnt at the present moment, after a continuance of long peace, no power is willing to give np any territory to which it has a title by treaty or a claim by possession. Forex ample, of the questions mentioned as disturbing threatening Europe,two of the most disquieting or arc those regarding Poland and Italr. Lot ns examine the present state of those questions, and see whether it is probable that a Congress would tend to a peaceful settlement of them. In the first place, with regard to Poland, the question Is not new to France, to Austria, or to ureatßritain. For several months these Powers? while carefully übetaining from any threat, have attempted to obtain from Kueaia by friendly repre sentations the adoption of measures of a Dealing nature, but have only succeeded in procuring pro mises, often repeated, that when the insurrection shall be put down recourse will be bad to clemen cy and conciliation. Would there be any advan tage in repeating in the name of a Congress repre sentations already mode with so little effect? Is it probable that a Congress would bo able to secure belter terms for Poland nnless by a combined em ployment of force? Considerable progress has been made by tho military preponderance, and by ibe unsparin" severity of Russia, insnbduing the insurgents. Is it likely that Bossia will grant, in the pride of her strength, what she refused in the early days of her discouragement ? Would she create an independent Poland at the more re quest of a Congress ? But if she would not, the - prospect becomes one of humiliation for Europe or oi war against Russia, and those Powers who. arc not ready to incur the cost and hazard of war may well desire to avoid the other alternative. It may be truly said, moreover, that the present period is one of transition. If tho insurrection shall be subdued, it will then be seen whether the promises of the Emperor of Russia are to be ftil* filled. li the insurrection shall not bo subdued, or If, in order to subdue It, the Polish population is treated with fresh, and. If that he possible, with aggravated rigor, other questions wDI arise which may require further consideration, hut which would hardly receiver solution from a large assem .bly of representatives of all the powers of Enrope. Indeed, it is tobcapprebendcd the questions arising from day to day, colored by the varying events of the hoar, would give occasion rather for useless debate than for practical and useful deliberation in a Con gress of twenty or thirty representatives, not ac knowledging Any cupreine authority, and not guid ed by any fixed roles of proceeding.. Passing to the question of Italy, rrcsb difficulties* occur. In the 'first place. It is intended to sanc tion by a new treaty thepresent state of possession in Italy? The Pope and tho sovereigns related to the dieposcssed princes, might, on the one side, object to give a title they bare hitherto refused to thcKingofltaly; and the King of Italy on the other, would probably object to a settlement which would appear to exclude him, by inference at least, from the acquisition of Rome and Yenetia. Bnt is it intended to ask Austria in Congressto renounce the possession of Venetia? Her Majesty’s Gov ernment have good grounds to believe that no Austrian representative would attend a Congress where such a proposition was to he discussed. If they are informed that such - on inten tion were tannonneed beforehand, Austria would decline to attend the Congress; and that if tho question were Introduced without notice, the Aus trian Minister would qciq the assembly. Hero again, therefore, the deliberation of the Congress would soon be brought in sight of an alternative of nnllitvorwar. Bnt it is impossible to assem ble a Congress and to summon an Italian represen tative to eit in it without discussing tho state ol Yenetia? The Emperor of the French would be the first person to feel and to admit that each a course would not be possible. - - With regard to Germany and Denmark, it ia toe that several of the powers of Europe have inter ested themselves in that question, bnt- the addi tion of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Turkey to the deliberation would scarcely Improve tho prospect of a satisfactory* solution. Ana it, with regard to Poland and Italy, no beneficial result is likely to he attained, is it expedient to call together a gen eral Congress of all the States of Europe to find a remedy Tor tho anarchy of Moldo-Wallachla ? Where all these questions—those of Poland. Italy, Denmark and tho Dannhian Provinces—to be de cided by»the mere utterance ofoplnions, tho views of her Majesty's government upon most of thorn might, perhaps, be found not materially to differ from those oi the Emperor of the French. But if the mere expression of opinions and wishes would accomplish no positive results, it appears certain that the deliberations of a Con gress that would consist of demands and pretca slons pat forward by some and resisted by others; and, there being no supreme authority in such an assembly to enforce tbo derisions of the majority, tho Congress would probably separate, leaving many oTIU members on worse terms with each other than they had been when they met. Bat if this would bo the probable result, it follows that no decrease of armaments is likely to be effected by the proposed Congress. M. Drouyn de L*Hays' refers to a proposal made by Lord Clarendon In one of the last sittings of the Congress of Paris, But her that pro* postil to hare reference to a dispute between two powers to be referred to tbo good offices of a friend* ly power, bnt In no way to the assembling of a general Congress. Not being able, therefore, to discern the likeli hood of those beneficial consequences which me .Emperor of the French promised himaalf when proposing a Congress, her Majesty’s Government following their own strong convictions, after ma ture deliberation, feel themselves unable to accent his Imperial Majesty’s invitation. - e Yon are instructed to give copy of this dispatch M.

CLOUD OP WAR IN JAPAN. The Paris IfunUtHrdtV ArruMh&s a letter from Yokohama, Japan, dated 28th Septem ber, which states that at that date the Daimios had been summoned for the end of October, to assemble under the direction of Prince Mara, now ninety-flveyearß of age andtheoldcstamongthcm. They were a{ this meeting to adopt resolutions against foreigners, at the instigation of the Mikado who wishes that’ a declaration of war should bo made with the usual formalities. It Is not believed that this plan will succeed, for though all the Daimios are animated by the •same hatred against foreigners, the majority appear unwilling, through motives of pru dence, to assume the offensive. Several of them possess enormous fortunes, and hare fleets and armies, and. they have all erected batteries on the coast for their defence.’* The forts are numerous, and arc to be found even In the smallest creeks..’ They are in general well built and well armed. The Daimios had not held a general meeting. since the year ICSO, and at that period they refused to adopt measures similar to those demanded of them at present RETORTED DEATH OF LORJ) ELGIN. ’ The London Tima of November 38, uas news from India of the probable death of Lord Elgin, who went out os successor to Lord Canning. The Tima says: . “Should it unhappily he the case that* Lord Elgin has succumbed, the -country will have lost the third. of a remarkable list of men who, after having governed India with trans cendant brilliancy and success, have been re moved without having on interval granted, them to, repose in tbe greatness they have • achieved.' Lords Dclhonsic, Canning and Elgin were almost of an age; they were all at' Christ Church together, and entered public* life about the same time.” 

DANISH PREPARATIONS FOR WAR,. Denmark Is getting ready for war. Her na vol vessels are ordered Into instant service, and the Minister of War has ordered out all the soldiers belonging to tbo corps which garrison Holstein, Schleswig and Northern. 1 Jutland. A SCENE IN THE REBEL COINGKESS. Foote’* Denunciation or Jc£T, Davis, [Proceedings of the Rebel Congress on Wedoes " day, Dec. o—Richmond Enquirer's Report.] . Mr. Foote offered a resolution instructing the appropriate committee to provide for the increase of pay of soldiers. In supporting his resolution, Mr. Foote said that the matter was not only of grave Import, hut it was a patriotic duty. He further urged the question at some length, assuming that no action in regard to the currency would fully restore it to its nominal value, and that, therefore, injustice was done the soldier in refusing him an equa ble compensation.* He contended that tlifc President was op posed to the increase of soldiers’ pay, from the fact that he stated in his message that the suggested action -upon-the currency would obviate its necessity, by jappn&itnatfwf the nominal value of the money., Unwanted the xch<Jc value secured. Mr. Gartrell, of Ga., vindicated the Presi dent from the imputation, and argued at some length to show that the increase of the pay of the soldier waa one of the President’s most eager wishes.' * The resolution was lost • Mr. Foote then ottered an amendment-in structing the appropriate committee (Milita ry) to inquire Into tlic causes of the late dis aster near Chattanooga, and ascertain and re {iort whether it was owing to a want of. valor n the troops, as stated in the President's Message, or to other causes. Mr. Foote said he would now defy the most devoted champions of the President to take issue with him here. Whoever charged that army with a want of valor, he nega-' tived; whosoever undertook to throw the re sponsibility of that disaster upon that army, or upon any portion ofit, be would take Issue with him. A more valiant body of soldiers, the world never saw. He would undertake to say that the President himself was re sponsible for that defeat, and he was pre pared to prove It; and, furthermore, he would show that be had endeavored to skulk the responsibility and throw it upon the brave men who had bared their breasts to the battle.. No man should denounce those ' true men as wanting in valor, with impuni ty. It was an accusation dishonorable to the author and discreditable to all, which would tend to the demoralization of our troops, and* may be productive of still averse disasters. After that unfortunate campaign in Ken tucky, It was urged upon the President to remove from the command of the army General Bragg, who had proven lanftelf already incompetent for *his position. It was known how be permitted the inferior and partly demoralized army of the enemy to i un& him find secure communlcatioiwvith .onisville, from which they received heavy reinforcements and supplies; and further on, (for he hod the prools,)hc had proposed to divide his army into different detachments, and would have carried out his plans, but that he was outnumbered by the opposite opinions of his council, who told him that the plan was un-Napoieonlc, and that he would be overwhelmed if he attempted it. The Presi dent was colled upon then to remove him os Incompetent and even dangerous. 'When he came out of Kentucky, from what proved to have been only a jeans expedition and a per fect failure as a military aUiiir, he (Mr. Foote) took part with his colleagues and agalahrged • his removal. They waited upon the Presi dent; it would be out of order to say what occurred. But tile result is known—Bragg •Was not removed. That man (Bragg) has been most odious to both the army and peo ple for more than a year, and the President must have known it But he visited the army and said there was no cause for the com plaints. I also visited the array, continued Mr. Foote, and I mingled with the meu, and addressed nearly every brigade in it—not, however, upon Bragg,' because I would not for the world have sown any discontent But . I found the whole army distrustful of him. One -thing is certain, he has driven away every one of his best Generals. He has driv en away the skilled and gallant Polk; he has forced the noble-hearted Buckner to leave him; he has calmnniatcd Breckinridge, and victimized McGowan. Every body knows he is on bad terms with Hardee. He is so con stituted that be can not agree with any of bis commanders. What is more, one of my col leagues has received u letter from Bragg him sclt in which he said—only five weeks, ago— that he could not command that army effec tively unless he was clear of, unless there were cashiered, twelve Brigadier Generals ‘ and a whole regiment of field officers. Presi dent Davis was appealed .to by nearly every officer there for his removal. But he stood up for Bragg; he had committed himself to the country; he had expressed'his opinion' publicly, of Bragg's eminent fitness for the •command, and was determined to risk the .safety of the country upon it. For the same reason, and-under the same circumstances, Pemberton “was retained. That was the sole reason of the fall of Vicksburg.. To show the pertinacity of the President, the Military Court directed to look to the conduct of Pem berton was dispensed with in two days after it met, by order of the President When this man had surrendered—dishonorably surren dered—his command to the enemy, the Pres ident made him his companion, carried him with him to Bragg's army, and, if the truth is told, many a soldier, as they rode along the line, said, “there goes the traitor who de livered us over at v icksburg I” Even then, the President had the temerity and unblush ing disregard of .public sentiment, in bis own Statft, and elsewhere, to offer to that same Pemberton the command of Polk's corps; and if he - had undertaken that 'duty, he would have been slain in the earliest hour of battle, or.eyen before a battle, by the hands of Ids own men. I will farther add that,uponthepropo sition sending Longstrcct into East Tennes see, the President concurred with Bragg, and that army was divided. ' Inferior in numbers to the enemy; but inferior to none in the world in- valor, Bragg’s army was left against an overwhelming foe in front. By tiiis prdcr, the President did not leave more than* thirty thousand men under Bragg, while the enemy numbered Irom one hundred thousand to one hundred and twenty-five thousand. Before this force, the most va liant and experienced soldiers of any time or any land, in numbers like to ours, must have been overwhelmed. What now does the President say? Docs, ho -come forward boldly . and generously’ and say: “I am now responsible forthedssastcr!’* No! He charges towith want of valor. Icharge him not with want of valor, but with want of confidence In,the opinions of others, with gross mismanagement, with contempt lor the sentiments of the people of the country. •. I *told him twelve months ago that unless Wfis removed Tennessee, would be in the hands of the enemy, and now my bleed ing State attests- the truth of mv and the whole country’s prediction.. The "President never visited the army without doing it in jury—never yet, that It has not been followed by disaster. - He was instrumental in the Gettysburg affiiir; he instructed Bragg at Murfreesboro; be has opcccd Georgia to 100,000' of the enemy's troops, and laid"South Carolina liable to destruction. I charge him with having almost ruined the country, and will meet his champion anywhere to discuss it. Would to God he may never visit the army again; would to God he had yielded to the public sentiment of his country ? would to God ho had been able to appreciate tbo truth that when confidence is once lost by the people in an officer It is suicidal to retain him. - * A Bible Society Meeting ending: In a Fight. - A meetingof the ITamillonßnmchßlbloSo clety tv as held at Hamilton, C.

Bdward Jackson,' Esq., the Vico Pres ident, \vas nominated as Chairman, which was the signal for an uproar amongst a clique who were determined he should not occupy it He succeeded in doing, so, however, and made a brief speech. Two of the members arose, each claiming the floor, - when a dis graceful tumult arose, which continued in such a manner that the Chairman declared the meeting dissolved. ThcHamillonSpecta r gives the denouement as follows: ‘ Notwithstanding the declaration of the dis solution of the meeting, the crowd still lin gered In the hall, as if expecting some hing else to occur, and their expectations were not long nngrntlfied, A swaying to and fro of a knot ofpersons in the centre of the hall attracted oar attention, and on • proceeding thither we found Hugh McMahon and a Mr King struggling for the possession ol a walk ing stick. The origin of the disturbance, as near as we could ascertain, was as follows: McMahon went np to Mr. James Walker, who had the books of the Society under his arm, and took hold of them. Mr. King went in between them, and noshed away McMahon, Sir. Walker making' his escape in the mean time. McMahon seized hold of King’s stick, one dr two others joined in. and soon there was quite a disturbance, but it would doubt less soon have been quelled hod it not been for the introduction of another element. Some five or six Irishmen (and Roman Gatbo-’ lies, we believe) armed with shQlclabs, dashed .Into the crowd with wild whoops and yells, and laid about with their sticks In. the most promiscuous manner, -the leader calling out, , “ clear the way before you boys!” The seats were scattered in all directions, and a scene of the wildest confusion ensued. After a time the gang of rowdies went out of the ball, smashing at the scats with their bludgeons and yelling like savages. The excitement continued for some time alter their disap pearance; and it was not until the Superin tendent prepared to tnm out the gas that the crowd was persuaded to leave the halL (Contractors. nno

CONCLUSIVE PROOFS OP THE BFFIOACT OF HOSTETTEE'S STOMACHBITTEHS BEAR TOE WITNESSES. Worthless and pernicious articles sre so often bol stered op in the advertising columns of the press by fabricated letters! that the proprietors of HO3TET TEE’S BITTERS rarely give quotations from their cosiness correspondence, lest tbo GENUINE OPIN IONS of those who use and appreciate a GENUINE ARTICLE should be confounded by'the uathlnklog with the FULSOME RIGMAROLE put Into the months of MEN OF STRAW by unscrupulous empi rics and charlatans, whose doable objftt Is to SELL both their trash and the PUBLIC. - Believing, however, that FACTS IMPORTANT TO THE HEALTH AND COMFORT OP THE PUBLIC, and which can he VERIFIED AT ANT MOMENT by addressing the parties who vouch for them, ought not to be bid under a bushel, the undersigned fpubliah be low a few communications of recent date, to which they Invite the attention of the people, and* at 'the same time ESPECIALLY BEQUEST all readers who may feci interested in the subject to ADDRESS THE INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES, and ascertain the’ correctness of tbe particulars. . . It may be thought, perhaps, that a preparation like HOSTETTER’S STOMACH BITTERS, which Jias long been a STANDARD TONIC throughout - the WESTERN HEMISPHERE, and is rapidly becoming a staple of trade at tbe antipodes, speaks for itself In stronger tones than private culoglum can speak of It. This is true; but tbe phases of disease are almost In numerable, and every day new Instances of the suc cess of the Bitters, either as a PREVENTIVE ! or a CUBE, come to. the knowledge of the proprietors through the malls. Some of these are of immense In terest to thousands placed In precisely the same cir cumstances as the parties who have been PROTECT ED or BELIEVED, and therefore U seems almost an act of duty to put thoA on rqeord. For example, seveivclghUisoft be multitudes who go to sea suffer more or less from SEA SICKNESS. They dread this terrible affliction more than tbe tary of tbo elements, and it must he on unspeakable satisfaction to them to learn that it can be averted by the use of HOSTETTEE’S BITTERS. It Is only within tbe last twelve months that this GREAT FACT IN MEDICA TION has been established, and benco it Is not uni versally known.. Those who have tested this newly developed property of tbe preparation, and escaped sea sickness* by Us aid, arc .naturally anxious to spread the glad tidings among all who “go down to the sf a in sblps and do business on tbe great waters.” Tbe witness on this point whose testimony la append ed, not only gives his own* experience, but corrob orates it with emphatic evidence from other sources. If there be aoy who sre skeptical on the sabjcct, they tfro hereby referred directly to him and to the gentle man who shored with him the beneficial effects of tbe antidote. The Immense increase in the sale of HOSTETTER’S BITTERS, both at homo and abroad, during the post .year, proves that the world, while it obeys the Scrip tural Injunction to “to try all things," only “HOLD FAST to that which is GOOD.” Spurious prepara tions, Uko poisonous tangi, arc continually springing up, bnt their character Is soon discovered, and they are “flung like, worthless weeds away.” On the other hand, a great antidote, that performs all It pro mises’, and even more than its proprietors claimed for ‘ is on its introduction, is “not for a day,-but for aU time.” Every dose administered of a useless or deletereons nostrum, helps to disabuse the public mind of the im pressions it may have received from tbo flourish of trumpets with which the deceptions article was an nounccd; while, on the contrary, every bottle sold of a really valuable medicine secures the permanent. custom of the purchaser, and makes him an ADVER TISER OF ITS MERITS among bis Meads. It Is thus that IIOSTETTER’S BITTERS have obtained their unparalleled popularity. The Press, indeed, has '•made the GREAT STOMACHIC widely known, bnt It la the uniformly successful results of PERSONAL EXPERIMENT that have rendered It a HOUSEHOLD MEDICINE throughout the length and breadth of the land, and the main reliance of life TRAVELER, the VOYAGER, the MINER and th» PIONEER. During the Summer months a pure, wholesome Tonic, In which are also incorporated the properties of an antl-hlUous and mild asperlent agent, la casen . dally needed. Sneb a preparation la HOSTETTER’S STOMACH BITTERS, the rarest preventive and core of dyspepsia, biliousness, constipation and nervous debility ever placed within the reach of the commu nity. • Against the depressing and sickening tendency of heat and miasma it is a potent safeguard, and upon persons of feeble constitution and uncertain health, Us renovating effects arc most extraordinary. • fir. Nicholas Horn, New Torn, Mafeh 3,1853. DilHostetteb—Dear Sirs Being of a bilious tem perament, and having suffered much from sea sick ness heretofore, I determined, wheu leaving New Or leans for New York, in Jane last, to try your cele brated Stomach Bitters. Havlngmado tbe trip In the propeller Trade Wind without the least incon venience, owing to thdlr preventive efileacy, I pro cured; on the 32th of July, a box of your Bitters, for the use of myself and a few friends, on our contem plated voyage to Europe la tho Great Eastern. After getting to sea I opened tbe box, and, together with about ten of my fellow’ passengers, partook of the .Bitters. On the second day some of the ladles on hoard fell sick, bnt by taking half a wine glassful three times a day, they soon recovered. Dr. Golds borow, the ship** physician, and Capt. Paton, the Commander, together with a large portion of the passengers, subsequently experimented with tbe Bit ters, and uniformly with entire success. They will certify to the fact that during tho whole trip not one person on board was sea sick after the second day. Dr. G. having appropriated the last remaining bottle, as an Infallible specific, I bad none of tbe article on my return voyage, and suffered more thou I can de scribe In consequence. I have orders for two boxes from two of my late fellow passengers, now In Liver pool, and shall send them out by the next steamer. Yon ought to have a depot In Liverpool. Advising all persons vesturing for the first time (or Indeed at any time) to sea, to obtain. If possible, a supply of your Bitters before leaving port, and thereby SECURE themselves against son sickness. I am respectfully, your obedient servant, JOHN A.MUELLOR. Brooklyn, N. Y., May 223,1863, Messrs. Hosteteb & Smith: Gentlemenl have used your Bitters during the last six weeks, and felt It due to yon and to tbe public, to express my hearty approval of their effect uponme. I never wrote a “ puff” for any one, and I abhor every thing that savors of quackery. But your Bitters are entirely removed from the level of the mere nostrums of the day, being patent alike to all, and exactly what they profess to he. They are not advertised to euro everything, but they arcrecommendcd to assist nature In the alleviation and ultimate healing of many of the most common Infirmities of tho body, and this they will accomplish. I had been unwell for two months, ss Is usual with me during the Spring. I was bilious, and suffering from indigestion and a general disease of the mucous membrane, and though compelled to keep at work. In the discharge of my professional duties, was very weak, of a yellow complexion, no appetite, and much of the time confined to my bed. When I had been taking your Bitters a week, my vigor returned, the sallow complexion was all gone, Ircllshed my food, and now I enjoy the duties of the mental application which so recently were so very Irksome and burden some to me. When I used yoor Bitters IrzLTachange everyday. These are tacts. All Inferences must bo •made by each Individual for himself.
