GOOD MAN GONE. Sudden Death of Caleb Mead, of Cale donia. From the Corunnu Journal: The people ot our city and vicinity were greatly shocked on Monday evening, on learning of the death of Caleb Mead, a well known farmer of Caledonia township, and who resided a short distance north of tins city. lie waa in (own ou Monday of last week, appajHitlj in his usual health, greet ing cordially tluse ol I. is friends whom he happened to meet. and just a week liom that day he had gone to Ms last home. Mr. Mead was t.iken with a severe colli which soon developed into typhoid pneumo nia. Everything that kind hands and medical treatiut nt could do was done, but all proved of no avail, and he gradually passed avay at five o'clock in the afternoon of Monday last, surrounded by his sorrow stricken family, lie leaves a widow and ten children, one son and nine daughters. The sou and the eldest three daughters are married, leaving six children at home. The funeral services were held yesterday at the Free Methodist church, Rev. W. G. Nixon officiating. The'church was inade quate to hold the large number of old friends and neighbors who gathered to pay a last tribute of respect to one whom they had known and honored. II. F. Wallace Tost G. A. R., of which he was a member, at tended the services in a body and at the grave used its beautiful ritual service. A handsome wreath from the Tost and a floral lyre fro in Corunua friends, were silent emblems of the esteem of bis intimate friends. Mr. Mead was sixty years of age, and came to ibis county in the early fifties, and bad by honest toil procured and cleared a farm.making for himself and family a pleas ant home, lie was a man of genial nature and of the strictest integrity. He possessed a large heart and wou'd, if be could, have relieved all the suffering he knew of, and bis many acts in this direction will long be remembered by the many whom he has aid ed. In politics be was a republican of the eUl wait sort, but would never vote for a man simply because he was on his ticket, but would always bolt an unworthy candl date, lie never aspired to office himself, but was persistent in the fight for good men for public positions. IBs death is a great loss to the community and a greater one to the family, who have the earnest sy mpathy of all in their sad bereavement. It is often a mystery how a cold has been 'caught" The fact is, however, that when the blood is poor and the system depressed, one becomes peculiary liable to diseases. When the appetite or tho strength' falls, Ayer'a Sarsaparllla should be taken without delay. Christmas and New Vear's Holiday Rates. Dec. 24th, 25th and 81st and Jan. 1st, 1807, the Ann Arbor R.

Washington, Dec. 4. The president yesterday Issued a proclamation the ef fect of which is to relmpose upon the vessels entering from Germany the same tonnago dues that are Imposed on vessels entering the United States from Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain and other maritime nations in Europe and Asia. Ge rman vesels were excepted In 1888 from the payment of the dues un der the shipping reciprocity act of 188C. During the past year, at the request of the treasury department, the state department has made a full Investiga tion into the charges Imposed upon American vessels in German ports, and the fact has been developed that while the imperial government does not im pose taxes on shipping, yet the govern ments of the German maritime taxes, for years have imposed shipping taxes, bo that there was no real reciprocity.

With crowded galleries the Henatora and representa tives of the United States came to order today at noon for tha last session of tha Fifty-fourth congress. In the senate there was but one order of business the readlngof the president's message, which took nearly two hours. At Its con clusion the senate adjourned. In the house the message was also read and the death of ex-Speaker Crisp was an nounced and a resolution of regret was adopted, after which the house also ad journed. The president's message begins with felicitating the country on the fact that a very exciting election has passed peacefully, clearly demonstrating the permanence of our Institutions. He then deplores the fact that the Turk Is still allowed by Europe to butcher and rob Christians, but hopes for better things in that regard - and says the claims of Americans who have been despoiled by Moslems will be pushed, although the porte has not admitted their Justice. With reference to Cuba he says the rebels have not the 'shadow of a civil government, and that the fact probably is that they never have had except on paper; that as things stand now the proper position, in honor, of the United States, is one of strict neutrality, but Intimates that a time may come when In the highest interests of humanity the United States should Intervene. He has offered that if Spain would grant reforms before the rebels lay down their arms to make an effort to guar antee their acceptance as a finish of the war. In passing he utters the Monroe doctrine sentiment that no other gov ernment must interfere In the matter. He devotes a large portion of his message to the defense of the Wilson tariff bill, which he says will, if given a fair chance which circumstances have bo far denied it produce all the reve nue the government needs, and gives figures In support of his claim. With reference to currency reform he has one principal remedy and that is the absolute retirement and cancellation of all government currency that can be used to deplete the treasury reserve. The best plan to do this, he believes, is to fund the notes. The message has only a paragraph of a congratulatory nature about the Venezuela case, and then covers the reports of all the departments, referring to the navy, the army, coast defense, penslons.etc. Of pensions he says he has endeavored within his sphere to protect the pension roll and make it what it should be a roll of honor.
