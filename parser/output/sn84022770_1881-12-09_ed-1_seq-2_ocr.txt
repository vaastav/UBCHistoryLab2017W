FRIDAY EVE'G, DEC. 9, ISSI. Satan's Methods. The Walla Walla Ciiiai opposes a prohibitory enactment. It styles such a statute a " sumptuary law," and defines its purpose to be to " specify what mankind shall eat or drink." Now without desiring to be captious, we object to the use of the word as well as the meaning given to it. A h'gh-souuding term is often hurled at advocates of refoiiu, and although it may not always strike the object for which it is aimed, it is almost sure to hit some timid per son on the " anxious seat" and si lence his good intentions as long as its resonant syllables vibrate upon his ears. A sumptuary law is not, as the Union assumes, a rule pre scribing what " mankind shall eat or drink," and if prohibition does this it accomplishes much more than has ever been claimed for such enact, ments. Its primary object is to pro hibit the sale and use of intoxicating liquors, not so much on account of its effects upon the purse and the stomach of the drinker as the disas trous results upon the community, to avert the long train of lamentable consequences which afflict society as a direct result of periodically de grading the mind of man to the plane of idiocy and insanity. It cannot be restricted to the narrow idea conveyed by the term sumptu ary, affecting only personal inclina tions and comfort. It is not the ruin of mind and body—deplorable as it may be—which appeals loudest for restraint, but the more disastrous effects upon society and those in timately connected with the inebriate in the struggle of life. A man may possess the right to burn bis house, provided it shelters nobody but himself and its destruction- does not imperil the property of others, but if either of these conditions exist, or its loss may result in his becoming a public charge, the community is in terested in tho act, and ho is very properly restrained by law which jealously guards the rights of those dependent upon him as well as the public who may be injured by his folly. A man may seek to take his own life, and be blameless so far as the law takes cognizance of tho act, but if the attempt is made against the life of another, the door of the felon's cell closes upon the malefac tor for no other reason than to guard the right of his fellow man to live. If prohibition sought only to restrain a man from drinking intoxicating liquors whereby he wasted his sub stance in riotous living, it might possibly come under the Union's classification and be considered merely a sumptuary law. But its object is far more beneficent. It is to guard against the profligate ex penditure of means not wholly his own, to protect the life of his fellow man which is continually menaced when delirium has usurped the throne of reason, and to save from possible destruction the common property which is endangered by the acts of a madman. These are the primary objects of prohibition—objects which, when weighed beside the personal damage sustained by the inebriate, command attention from their mag nitude and appeal to the conscience for legal restraint. The Union admits, however, all that the most radical advocate of temperance reform claims, regarding the cost of the liquor traffic. It con cedes that this indulgence makes men maniacs, that it arouses the baser pas sions and leads to lawless acts which make " court houses, jails, police men, sheriffs, judges and the para phernalia of law necessary," but proposes to pay the bill (or a part of 'it) from licenses. To be exact, we quote: " Why not make gambling and the sale and use of liquor pay most of the cost of maintaining these things? Men who desire to drink should be made to pay the cost of caring for them when drunk. * * Taxpayers who do not drink or gamble, should not be conmelled to pay officers to keep others from doing so." The Union is entitled to our thanks for this candid admission, which in itself controverts the whole argu ment. Were it possible to make Bum pay all the costs of its main tainance —and " tax-payers who do not drink should not be compelled to pay," as it admits—the increase cost would fall still heavier upon the consumer and tend to moderate ex cess or the traffic would become so unprofitable many if not all the shops would close. If this effect shoud result such a provision would be as good a prohibitory law as migbt be desired. But it would be an essen tial condition that it be rigidly en forced, and all the costs of prose cution resulting from liquor, the maintainance of its convicts and the damage resulting from destruc tion of property and loss of life, should be collected from cause of evil, ardent spirits and their vendors. But the Union is suggesting an im possible alternative for one that has been tried and found reasonably ef fcotive. Would the whisky power accept it as a couipioiuisi measure ? Would il not ocpose such a sugges tion even moie strenuously than pro hibition with a hope of evasion by some one of the many devices which Satmi invents whereby ail illicit traf fic may be maintained? But hold, friend Uni»n, you do not propose ] for whisky to pay nil the costs re ; suiting from its use. \\ ho is to ! make up the deficit ? Evidently the j tax-payers who do not drink. Is ! this fair, or just ? I* it right to make the abstainer pay for any part of your indulgence ? Fan you harmo nize such a suggestion with any code of human rights ? I uless you can, give os something better, or at least : cea.-e throwing " sumptuary" dust into the eyes of a discerning people. - -♦ ♦- —— PATOUKD UP.— The showiug the STANDARD made of the illegal action of (ioveinoi Newell in appointing his daughter to a Territorial office, and the no less illegal act of the upper-house Solous iu confirming the appointment, has resulted in herculeau labors the past week to patch up the law so as to permit the Governor (or his daughter rather) to draw the salary. The plan adopted was to amend tho law creatiug the office, while renacting it in the code, but the House voted down tho proposition, although a majoiity of its members favor the enfranchisement of women. The Council then amended the bill so as to make women eligible, and the House again voted on the proposi tion and refused to concur. A committee of conference was then appointed who refused to consider the subject, as it had twice been acted upon in the House. This was regarded as final, but on the last day of the session, when seven mem bers were absent the measure was sprung and carried by the friends of the amendment, more,*it is eaid, to relieve the Governor from embarrass ment than from a sense of right or propriety. The Council then re confirmed the appointment, a clear acknowledgment of the illegality of its former action. So the admission has been clearly made that the ap pointment was in violation of law. If the Executive knew it to be so, ho did a very, very improper thiug; if he did not possess this knowledge, it indicates that he is a very incom petent officer. Either horn of the dilemma is presented for him to accept. The New York Tribune is begin ning to show up the tiue state of the political policy cf President Arthur's Administration. It reports that his cabinet is to be solidly stalwart, that Grant has been arranging his best foreign and other appointments; and that Grant has already offered sow eral appointments to his friends, just the same as if he was actually the President. The Garfield wing of the Republican party is to be main ly and generally ignored. Mac- Veagh baa been trapped into a course which leaves him uuder sus picion of being opposed so the pro secution of the star route plunderers, while Arthur takes the credit of pushing them to trial. The low order of cunning for which Grant is distinguished is apparent in this, we should judge. The Tribune is get ting to be well convinced of tbe true state of things, and is beginning to talk out loud in meeting. 

ALTHOUGH the University received no aid from the Territory by legis lative appropriation, it is quite evi dent that its usefulness will not be impaired by the streak of economy which prompted the Assembly to plug the spigot while they allowed a stream to flow from the bung-hole. It appears that Mr. Villard, wrote a letter to President Anderson last October, expresssing his willingness to extend pecuniary aid to the insti tution, provided the Legislature failed to do its duty. Publicity is now given to the letter, and the closing paragraph requesting its re cipient to keep the matter a secret until it should lje ascertained that an appropriation would not be made, shows that it is not intended as an ostentatious gift, but a merited do nation to a worthy institution. 

WUILE the Legislature was exceed ingly "economical" in making a contract for printing a pamphlet containing the more important laws, involving a few hundred dollurs' ex pense, it had no such scruples when it hired its clerks. The sum of S9O was paid for ten days' services of one Enrolling clerk, and all the othor Enrolling and Engrossing Clerks re ceived $35 per week, during the whole session, which was double what the work might have been con tracted for from competent scribes. This is not the only instance in which the Assembly has made an un just discrimination in the price of labor, as will be fully shown before the matter is allowed to pass into oblivion. SMALL-POX is still epidemic in New York, Chicago, and several other large eastern cities. GEX. Kilpatrick, Minister to Chili, died, at Santiago, last Sunday. Fiiicot Sound Slii|»i»iiiur. The tx'ei't and steady growth of the shipping interest on Puget S und can best be shown by a com parative statement, which is fortun ately at hand, compiled bv Dr. T. T. Minor, of Port Townsrnd, from olli cial sources. He states that during the year ending June 30, 18"8, there were CD sail and JO steam vessels documented at that port, with a <■ ar rowing capacity of 111,000 tons, which is exceeded by that of only 26 of the 12") collection districts in the United States, and exceeds the shipping of more than one-half of the States con sidered separately. The tonnage of American vessels in the foreign trade, which entered aud cleared for the same period, is as follows: En tered, 2(111 vessels, tonnage 1.12,825; cleared 284 vessels, tonnage lf>7,- 178; which exceeds that of such vessels so entered and cleared for j,his same year at 120 of the 121 ports of entry in the country. The tonnage of foreign vessels in foreign trade for the same period, was: En tered 40 vessels, tonnage 19,5)11; cleared 01 vessels, tonnage 30,902, exceeding tiiat of the same year in 5)4 of the 125 ports of entry. The tonnage of Ameiican ocean steam vessels, iu the foreign trade which entered and cleared at said port in the same time, were: Entered 178 vessels, tonnage 130,471; cleared 183 vessels, tonnage 131,432, which is exceeded by that of only two ports iu the United States, Now York and Sad Francisco. The tonnage of foreign ocean steam vessels in the foreign trade, entered and cleared for tho same year, was exceeded by that of hut ten other ports of the whole country. It is further noted that tber: are employed in the Puget Sound trade at least 75 deep-sea vessels in the general coasting trade, which are enrolled an-', licensed, thus rendering it unnecessary to make entry or clearance at the Custom House. One-third of these vessels are documented iu tho Puget Sound District, and nearly all the remain der in San Fraucisco. Ia the year 1880, there cleared from Port Townseud, American ves sels for foreign ports daring the four months ending Oct. 30, GO vessels, with a tonnage of 40,244, and for the same period in 1881, itamouuted to 111 vessels nud 65,393 tons, an increase of 45 vessels and 19,149 tons for the period taken for com parison just closed. Iu 1880, for the same four months there entered American ships from foreign ports, 02 vessels, with a tonnage of 42,219, and in the samo period of the present year 116 vessels, with 08,305 tons, an iucrease of 53 vessels and 26,14G tons. The total number of Amer ican steam vesels for the same per iod of 1880 entored from foreigu ports, was 30, with a tonnage of 29,- 328, and for a like period of the suc ceeding year 72 vessels, with a ton nage of 49,599, an increase of 42 vessels and 20,271 tons. There cleared for the same period in 1880, of American steam ships for foreign ports, 33 vessels with n tounage of 30,339, and of that class of steamers for foreign ports in the same months ot 1881, 73 vessels and 50,288 tons, an increase of 40 vessels and 19,949 tons, or over 100 per cent, iu one year. These figuies indicate not only a remarkable growth of our maritiuio trade, but an exceedingly satisfac tory commercial standing when com pared with the great ports of the Atlantic seaboard. 

TIIE trial of Guitteau continues to draw its weary length along. The plea of insanity seems to be the main reliance of his counsel, and the prisoner by interruptions and excen tric actions, is trying to convinco tbe jury that he is of unsound mind. The impression is steadily gaining ground, however, that he is over acting his part, and only the more firmly adjusting the noose about his neck.

"We know whereof wo atlirm," (us the lawyer says) in making this asser tion. The late Legislative session lias developed the fact that thero are many men who may know how to manage conventions and not how to mako laws. Twenty-five cars aie leaving Chi cago daily for the Northern Pacific region loaded with steel rails for the extensions of the road beyond Miles City and Powder river. The Governor from his seat in the Library room of the Capitol, like an eagle from his aerie, looks down with complacency on the lesser hi rds taking their flight. If the Legislature had held out the twenty days of the extra session, Congre s would probably have had to pass an act repealing the whole batch of laws passed at both sessions. The Capitol stands like some " banquet ball deserted." Aud this quotation calls to mind that the lust banquet dispensed within its revered preeincts was neither carved with a knife or eaten with a spoon. Nobody would have tbe rashness to assert that any of the honorable legislators were drunk, when the sessiou closed, but we can bx-iug ample proof to show that many of them weie not sober by a jug-full.

The new furniture and carpets that have beeu purchased for tbe White House were selected by Mrs. Garfield on the occasion of her visit to New York a few weeks before the late President was shot. The amount thus far raised for the Gaifield monument at Cleveland is $50,000. It is not probable that this amount will he greatly exceeded. The design is to erect the monument over the remains at the cemeterv. A marble quarry has been discov ered in Spoktui eounty.

It is learned from the records of the county court of Chicago, that Augustus H. Parker, a cousin of the assassin, (Juiteau, was sent some years ago to the Elgin iusauo asy lum, where he died. A curious fact in this connection is that Guiteau himself appeared as witness of the mun's iusanitv. Tho London Times, in a compara tive nrticle upon the foreign trado of American and Great Britain, estim ates tho moucy and trade loss to America through the decline of her shipping nt C 16,000,000 yearly, nnd considers that nil increase of the severity of American competition with European agriculture is cer tain. The Presbyteriau Synod, composed of delegates from Presbyteries in tho adjoining parts of Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi, admitted a negro for several years, but in the recent session the question of ex cluding him was raised, and a majority voted to turn him out. This action wus based solely on his color. A. C. Cook, who was given a hundred thousand pontics for exer cising his pugilistic skill upon a wicked Ohio mini, who wished Guitteau had killed Garfield, is to experience some more of the re wards of virtue. An effort is making to securo him tho honorable and lacrative post of Doorkeeper of Con gress. J Last year there were 1,394 per sons in Bosteu who paid taxes on over $1,000,000 worth of property, and of those 203 were women. From this it will be seen that about fifteen per cent, of the tax pavers of Boston who pay on over $1,000,- 000 are women, aud it is estimated that there are about 3,000 female tax-payers at the Hub. William Waldorff Astor spoilt the boys in the New York district which he lately canvassed in the hope of an election to Congress. To give the crowd beer was all that hitherto had beou expected of a candidate; but Astor's standing order was for champagne, aud champagno became tho only tipple. And after all, A3tor lacked 2,000 votes of election. Washington specials agree that Jones, arrested for shooting Guiteau is in all probability tho wrong man.

The Bth of October was the touth anniversary of the Chicago fire. Iu that calamity of thirty-six hours, 2,1*24 acres were burned over, 17,- 450 buildings were destroyed, 98,- 8(!0 persons were rendered homeless —4OO of them losing their lives— and the total value of burned pro perty of all kinds was placed at $100,000,000. Yet in a single de cade all this has been replaced and more. The value of the buildings destroyed in October, 1871, was esti mated at $511,000,000, while those newly built, up to this October, aro estimated at more than $150,000,- 000. The lost ones were largely of wood; those that replace them are of brick, stone or iron.

Maietiß Wilcox, of Denver, arrived at th« House of correction to-night, bavin® in custopy a life prisioner, Heniy W. White, a desperado lately eon. victed of robbing a stage coach near Del Norte, Colorado, about five months ago and sentenced to the Detroit house of correction for life. About thr< e miles east of Pokagon on the .Michigan Central railroad' the {•••nvict picked the lock of big handcuffs witn a toothpick and feroc.ously attacked the marshal. He first struck him in a dazed way struck Wilcox again and brought him to his knees. There were 17 men in the car who saw the whola affair, but who left the officer to struggle with the desperate man who was fighting for liberty, and in the struggle White seized Wilcox's revolver and tried to shoot him when, Mrs. Smithson, wife of a Denver engineer, on her way to New York nud the only woman in the car, sprang upon the ceat behind the struggling man, seized the .con vict around the neck and disabled him to a sufficient extent to enable the marshal to once more secure con trol of him. White says if he*could have got a bullet through Wilcox he would have covered the passen'- gers with the revolver in one band while he untied his ankles with the other, and then "gone through* every one of the infernal cowards." The marshal says that Mrs. Smithson declined a reward, but that he is ijoing to send to her address in New York SSOO before he is 40 hours older. Fatal Foollshneu. OMAUA, Dec. 5, —At Columbus, Neb., on Sunday, several youug men were fooling with fireaims, when one of them named Dress put a double-barrel shotgun to his shoulder and pointing it at a com panion named Giant, said, " Now I've got the drop on you." Grant drew a revolver and pointed it at Dress' heal, when, whether by ac cident or otherwise, the weapon was discharged, the ball striking Dress in the left aide of the head and coming out on the right side. Dress fell and expired in a few minutes. Grant surrendered at once to the au thorities to await the result of an investigation of the case. Comment on the Mtutgi'. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— Comments ou the President's message among Senators and Congressmen of all shades of politicul belief appear to be that it is a very able document. Opinions as to the correctness of ito conclusions vary, of course, accord ing to party affiliation and individual sentiment, but there is a general agreement that in clearness, of style, dignity of tone and force and fresh ness of argumcnt.it is far above the average level of the annual Presi dential messages for a number ot years, and that it indicates the pos session by its author of a much higher grade of ability than has heretofore been commonly attrib uted to bim. There is some disap pointment among Pacific coast rV presectatives at the absence of an': hearty recommendation for legis JL lative action to restrict Chinese migration, especially as the Presi-V j dent takes pains to suggest that Con gress should carefully regard the ® "interests and susceptibilities" of the Chinese government in legislat ing upon that subject. On the other hand it is noticed with gratification that the message does say that leg islation is necessary to carry the treaties into effect, and also that the i President significantly (though not so openly as might be desired) refers -) to the evils of unrestricted Chinese immigration when he says that onr government " views with concern the efforts to seek replenishment of • the diminished population of the Sandwich islands from outward sources." A Chinese BUI. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—General Miller yesterday introduced in tbe Senate his bill to carry tbe Chinese treaty into effect. It was ordered to be printed and laid on the table to await action on committees, when it will be referred to the committee on foreign relations. Senator Grover also introduced a bill to-day to restrict Chinese im migration. His bill is a ropy of the vetoed fifteen-passenger bill, ex cept in allowing certain claßses of Chinese to come here, the exceptions being similar to those of Miller's bill; ordered printed. The Cabiaet Ckaagta. Secretary Hunt will retain bis Cabinet position and James will re-' 'main until the end of the present fiscal year. It is reported to-night that Kirkwood has also been enjoined by the President that he desires him to remain. Freliughuysen and Brewster are to be Secretary of State and Attorney General, and the Trea sury having been filled, this makes up the compliment of the Cabinet. It is evident Republicans are deter mined to push the matter of admis sion of Southern Dakota into the Union. Senators Windotr. snd Saunders have introduced bills for this purpose, both being substan tially the same. Saunders is chair man of the committee on Territories and all bills of this character will go into bis hands. Tbe Democrats intend to fight the measure, and chances are against them. Some WVetern BUI*. Senator Miller to-day introduced three bills "by request." One directs accounting officers of the Treasury to examine all unpaid ac counts heretofore filed in the depart ments of services rendered and sup plies furnished under direction of the Indian bureau or its agents, and in cases where said services and sup plies are found to have actualiy been applied to the benefit of the Indians, to report to Congress the balances equitably due on said ac count, notwithstanding no sufficient appropriations existed to pay them. Tim second bill provides that fees be allowed Registers and Receivers for reducing testimony to writing. THE President's message will ap pear in full next week,
