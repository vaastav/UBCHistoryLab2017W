MESSAGE. To the Senate ■,:,/ Uoute of Representatives: . As a nation we still continue to enjoy a liter *jj« unprecfMtaited prosperity, and It Is probable that only Kdden epeculatlon and dipr.gar>i of Ucitlmate businfss methods on th«» part of the business world can materially mar this pros perity . * Vo'Congrws In our time has <i<>ni> mate good work of Importance than the present Congresc. Th^rr w«f« Pev«Bl matters left unfinished at T ,-, ,. last session, however, which l most ear riectly hope you will complete before your ad joiirnTTvnt. I npnin roeommenrl a law prohibiting; all cor j,omii"t« from contributing to tho campaign SapeuK* of any party Such a bill ha.s already passed one House of Con- Corpcration Cam- Rr»-fs. Let individuals naign Contributions, contribute as they desire; p but lei us prohibit in >■{- ♦rptive fashion all corporations from making contributiona f<T any political purpose, directly or indirectly. A!i"tl' f r bill which has just passed one House jf'jlu- «"' i n;rre«s, and which it Is urgently nei-«-s fSr\' should be enacted into law. is that con ferring upon the govern 3overnmer.t's Right mer.t the ripht of appeal of Appeal in In criminal cases on ques- Crimina! Cases. tiojis of law. This right exists in many of the Ft£trs; it exists in the District of Columbia by get of the Congress. It Is. of course, not pro }ief=ed that i» any case a verdict for the de fendant on the merits should be set aside. Re c^r.tly In one district where the government had Indicted certain persons for conspiracy in con nection with r» --bates the court sustained the de fendant's demurrer, while In another Jurisdic tion an Indictment for conspiracy to obtain re lates hns nrrn sustained by the court, convic tfem obtained under it and two defendants sen tencd to Imprisonment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conilict with each other. but it Is unfortunate thnt there should even be rd apparent conflict. At present there Is no way by which the government can cause such a conflict, when 1t occurs, to be solved by an ap jep.l to a higher court, and the wheels of jus tire nr<» blocked without any real decision of the <ju«»stior. I cannot too strongly urge the pass aaje of the bill In question. a failure to pass it Miil result in seriously hampering the povern- Bwnt in its effort to obtain Justice, especially egainst wealthy Individuals or corporations who do Krone. an<l may also prevent the govern ment from obtaining Justice for wageworkers who are r.ot themselves able effectively to con tat a case where the Judßinent of an Inferior court lias been against them. I have specifically la view ■ recent decision by a, district judsre aaiilia. railway employes without remedy for violation of a certain so-called labor statute. It F<*ns an absurdity to permit a single district judge, against what may be the judgment of the Immense majority of Ms colleagues on the teach, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the Congress to be "unconstitutional." and then to <seny to the rovernment the right to have the Supreme Court definitely decide the question. It is well •.. recollect that the real efficiency cf the law often depends not upon the passage of aits as to which there is great public ex citement, but upon the passage of acts of this nature as t.> which there is not much public ex citement, because there is little public under standing: ff their importance, while the Inter ested parties are keenly alive to the desirability of defeating them. The Importance of enacting v.- law the particular bill in question is further facreuaed by the fact that the government has tk.w definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law' in those trust and interstate com merce cap'-s vtiere such a Bourse offers a rea sonable <hance of success. At first, as was proper, every effort was made to enforce these lews ny civil proceedings; but it has become in m-aeißply evident that the action of the govern •■ ■ in finally deciding, In certain cases, to undertake criminal proceedings was justifiable, p.vA. i'iourli ■.. have been some conspicuous failures in these cases, we have had many suc eeases, which have, undoubtedly had ■ deterrent effect upon evildoers, whether the penalty in f.icted was in the shape of fine or Imprisonment —and penalties of both kinds have already been Ir.flictca by the courts. Of course, where the Judpe can see bis way to inflict the penalty of imprisonment the deterrent effect of the punish ment <>n oilier offenders Is increased; but sutfl eteßtly heavy Bnes accomplish much. Judge H01t. "..f the New York District Court, in a re <*r.t decMon admirably stated the need for trf-atinjr with just severity offenders of this kind. His opinion runs in part as follows: The povernment'ii evidence ... establish tlie .le f*&dant'« pui'it w:iJ» dear, conclusive and i.i us patc4. T!:«- case was v fla rant one.
