THE COLORED PEOPLE. turning to Washington The Senate has, by lot, deter mined Ibe length of the terms of the six new Senators as follows; Washington-Senator Squire ex pires March 3, 1891, and Senator Allen March 3, 1893; South Dakota -Senator Moody March 3, 1891 and Senator Pettlgrew March 8, 1893; North Dakota Senator Pierce March 3, 1891 and Senator Casey March 8, 1898. The terms of the Montana Senators will not be fixed until they occupy1 their seats Judge David J. Brewer, of Kan sas has been nominated by ihe President to be associate Jostle or thejSupreme Court to AH the vacan cy caused by the death of the late Justice Stanley Matthews, of Ohio. Judge Brewer is a nephew of Ju s tice Stephen J. Field of the Su preme Court; he has been since 1884 United States Judge for the eighth circuit of Kansas. He has filled a number ot important posi tions in Kansas, judicial and ether wise, and has always been a popu lar official. The nomination is highly pleasing to Senators Ingalls and Plumb, and in fact to every body, with the possible exception of.several disappointed candidates and their immediate friends. Jus tice Miller, over whose circuit Judge Brewer has presided for the last five years, says he considers him one of the ablest judges now on the bench. When Justice Brew er takes his seat on the bench with the fTst time in the history of the court that two of the contemporary justices have been so nearly related. Owing to the organization of the House on Monday the President's message was not read to Congress until Tuesday. The message has been well received by everybody except a handful of Southerners who profess to see in its plain state ment of the conditicn of political affairs in the South cause for alarm. The message is strictly conserva tive, both in tone and in its recom mendations, being thereby in strik ing contrast to the last dictatorial documents sent from the White House to Congress. Mr. Harrison evidently Intended this message to be confined to its strict constitu tional limits that of informing Congress of the state of the country. Its recommendations are in every instance what has been approved by the Republican party. Upon those things on which there are different opinions in the party he has presented the facts without recommendation. It is a document that has greatly disappointed the Democrats because it furnishes them with no ammunition. Next in importance to the Presi dent's message is Secretary Win doras annual report to Congress, which was made public on Wed nesday. Mr. Windom covers the entire financial field and fur nishes one of the most interesting as well as important reports of the kind ever made. It presents a plan for the satisfactory solution of the silver problem, which Mr. Windom believes will be accepted by silver and gold men. Space prevents fur ther notice of the report, but it should be carefully read by every intelligent citizen of the country. It may bj obtained by addressing Secretary Windom.

We visited this institution last Monday and was pleased to find it so well manned by Professor Has tings and his assistants. They have on record 144 students, about 130 in regular attendance. There is at this time about an equal division between male and female. We were present while the arithmetic classes were reciting and found them quite proficientquick and accurate in their work. Professor Hastings subjects them to the la test and most thorough drill. In our reflections on this institution we said what a blessing this to the colored people under its good man agement We understood the Professor to say they could still accommodate a few more students. There is how ever more room for females than males but can accommodate both sexes, certainly tne colored peo ple ought to avail themselves of the benefits and liberal offers of the good friends who are furnishing this institution for their education.
