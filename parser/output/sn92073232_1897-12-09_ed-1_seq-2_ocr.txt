VmisYTH's original McKlnley men may hear something to their advan tage a little later in the pte aispenu ing proceedings. Democracy everywhere will ap plaud the action of the Virginia Democratic legislative caucus in nominating Hon. John Daniel to succeed himself in the United States Senate. It looks as if the Asheville poultry show is going to be a big thing. Our former townsman, Mr. F. E. Hege, is General Secretary, and this is a guarantee that the show will be worth seeing. It will take place from January 4th to 7th. Tbebe Is to be an inter-collegiate debate in the near future between the Universities of North Carolina and Georgia, at Chapel Hill. This will be better than a football contest and more In harmony with the purposes of educational institutions. The suggestion, made through the Charlotte Observer and printed in yesterday's Sentinel, that Winston Salem and Charlotte celebrate the completion of the Mocksville exten sion to Mooresville, is to be com mended and should receive the atten tion of our commercial bodies. Hanna will not be able to increase the population of the Ohio legisla ture and this fact makes his case the more uncertain. Marcus and the money he manipulated are credited with showing a marvelous growth in some of the States last year. In the case of Legislatures, however, the number is fixed by law and this sort ot monkey business will not work. A fellow usually drops and drops hard from a pra eminent position acquired by a short cut reached by means not based upon merit. This is because he does not deserve the place and does not fit it and hence is without the capacity to measure up to its duties and responsibilities. This sort of a drop is likely to befall Marion Butler, Senator by reason of demagoguery and foxiness. The annually recuring talk of re- ducincr cotton acreage is now on One difficulty in the way ot putting the talk into practice is that one farmer thinkB other farmers wiu re duce and he will put in a big crop and Drofit bv the general shortage But, it usually turns one that too many think that way and conse quently the reduced crop fails to materialize. Last week's Caucasian contained a number of affidavits setting forth in substance that Butler did not say in his speech at Rocky Mount what the Argonaut said he said and what others swore he said. It is quite evident that somebody has lied or has been the victim of a very strange misunderstanding. The evidence is entirely conflicting. It's a case for the jury to decide. The idea of a Lyceum for Winston- Salem, revived by The Sentinel yesterday, Is favorably commented upon and if those who should be the leaders in such a movement will take hold of it it may be pushed to a suc cessful culmination. The opportuni ty to do such important work for the community should be utilized. Let's have the Lyceum. But little outlay as to expense will be neces sary, but the income in benefit will be great. Wheat has been cornered, they say, and the price may go to $1.50 a bushel. We presume this will he heralded as McKlnley prosperity, although it will mean the people will have to pay more for their bread and the wheat trpst will pocket an additional profit. Yet, after all, it is McKinley prosperity, because it will prosper the trust and this is the sort of prosperity the combines counted on when they chipped into the ex pense fund of the McKinley-Hanna campaign. , The Bocky Mount Argonaut, which charged Butler with villainous lan guage in his Bocky Mount speech, about which much has been printed and concerning which Butler has been busy recently in attempts to deny and head off its consequences that paper says Butler "has con tinually dodged what we charged him with and denied words we never claimed he uttered." The Argonaut eays, farther: "He Is simply dodging the issue. He said what we charged him with and ' we can double our affidavits twice oyer with the names of responsible citizens who will swear that Senator Butler made the accusation with which he Is charged." At present the matter is in such shape that the people can only decide as to which is entitled to credence, those who make the allegation and swear to it or those who deny the allegation and swear'to it. 

HARMONY. The address issued by the Demo cratic State Executive Oommittee was in accord with the great rank and file of the party and the respon sive echoes therefrom indicate strong and united fight next year in behalf of good government. The following comment by the Charlotte Observer, which was known not to be in thorough accord with the Democratic platform last year, doescredit to the heart and head ot its editor. Under the caption, "A Wise Night's Work," the Observer of the 2d says : "The Democratic party of the State is to be congratulated upon the action taken by the committee at the meeting held in Raleigh night before last. The re affirmation of the Chicago platform was to have been expected and will be acquiesced in by those who do not believe in all that is in that document. This declaration was discounted loner aero. I That is one point. There are two otners: xne one is tnac ine iaea oi entangling alliances found no favor whatever with the committee; -and the other is that there was a round denunciation of the results of legisla tive and administrative fusion in North Carolina. It means, unless the action of the committee is reversed, a straight fight next year. It means that the head, the heart, the conscience of the people are to be appealed to. The speak easy business is over with. Ground has been found tor a re united party to stand upon." In other words, the Observer fol lows the advice of Grover Cleve land to yield to "the arbitra ment of the party declarations," advice which Grover offered when adherence to it resulted in benefit to him, but adyice which he ignored when his own interests would not be enhanced and when only the party that made him would be benefitted by loyalty to its declarations, thus exercising a rule or ruin policy, piece of treachery that will never be forgotten. But Grover is now back number. Let him pass and let us turn our faces hopefully towards the future, trastlng that a traitor will never more become the leader of the great Democratic party, and that all those who were honest and sincere in following Cleveland and his ignus fatuus will, like the gifted Henry Watterson, wash their hands of the past delusion and return to the Democratic fold and help to fight the battles for good and honest government in both State and nation. Commenting upon the withdrawal of Mr. Watterson from the so called National Democratic party, the Observer, among other things, makes these pertinent remarks: "But the vast majority of those who gave this movement their coun tenance and were responsible for its being, deserted it and went bodiiy to the Republicans, using the name of the National Democratic party as a cover under which they might pass across the lines. They could not stand isolation; they had not the nerve to stand with a hopeless minority; they had no just apprecia tion of that noble sentiment of the Prohibitionists: "A vote which is cast for principle is never thrown away." Mr. Watterson did well to quit any such flag. So good a man as General Buckner may well be' ashamed of those who pushed him into leader ship and deserted him at the polls. Of the remnant the leadership is mercenary, and of the whole move ment it may be said that the play is over. Ring the curtain down." The University of Georgia is the object of a warfare si nail ar to that which has been waged against the University of North Carolina for several years, and with about the same lack of success. Referring to the repeated attacks made through the Legislature of that State, the Atlanta Constitution says "they come to nothing, for the legislature, representing the people, puts them aside." There's the safety valve for all this claptrap and bombast against State aid to higher educa tion "the legislature, representing the people, puts them aside." And so it will continue to do, in both Georgia and North Carolina. Pur suing the subject, the Constitution says: "This spirit that prompts these attacks is too narrow and bigoted to be described. It repre sents nothing conservative, dignified, broad-minded and constructive in Georgia. So far from seeking to im prove, it seeks to destroy and dis establish." The Chicago Journal is one gold bug paper that takes no stock in the repeated death and burial of the free silver cause. It warns the friends of the gold standard not to be deceived, and notifies them that instead of a decline of "silverism," every sign points to its growth and "to the certainity of another contest over the question as bitter, as fierce, and as clamorous as the first." So, after all, Bryan was right when he referred to the last campaign as "The First Battle," notwithstanding all the talk about the complete overthrow of the "silver heresy," as its enemies are pleased to term the free coinage policy. i. We agree with the Raleigh News and Observer in its statement that the recent address of the' State Dem ocratic Executive Committee "ought to be printed by the tens of thous ands and circulated broadcast In every county in the State." That address is clear cut, doesn't dodge issues, means what it says and says what it means, is honest and forceful, and its declarations should be placed in the hands and in the minds oi every honest and patriotic son of the Old North State. If this is done it will be a season of seed sowing and the harvest will be gathered in the elections next year. - A CALL TO DUTY. If anybody believed North Caro lina Democracy would abandon the Chicago platform in the next cam paign he will be wiser after reading the pointed and stirring address issued by the State Executive Oom mittee, which appears in full in this issue of The Sentinel. In reference to the Chicago plat form, and particularly to the free coinage plank, the address is clear cut and without ambiguity and leaves not a nail upon which to hang a prediction that the fight for bi metallism will be abandoned. Those who may have calculated upon such a turn reckoned without their host and placed too small value upon the integrity and loyalty and courage of the invincible Democracy of the Old North State. Just a quotation here and thi re from the address wili be sufficient to 9how the firm stand taken upon the Chicago platform, including the cur rency feature. Referring to the recent elections, it says the peop!e"have expressed their faith in the Chicago platform, their be'ief in bimetallism, their disgust and disapproval ot Republican creeds and practices, and, abovt, "all, their hatred of the tyrannous gold stand ard. They show that they will no longer submit to the robbery of trusts, the domination of bosses and the oppression of the money power." Again: "We rejoice that 'sham in ternational bimetallism' has been ex posed. There Is now no room for Republican dodging." And further: "ve reaffirm our belief in the principle of the Chicago and State platforms of the Demo cratic party, as adopted in 1896, in their entirety; and we will still sup port those principles until they are written in our laws." The committee performed a gra cious and deserved act in expressing confidence in the honor and integrity of our peerless leader, William Jen nings Bryan. It also did the proper thing in invi ting the co operation of all voters who desire the supremacy of Demo cratic principles. The arraignment of the incompe tent Republican administration of State affairs is timely, as is the ap peal to every patriotic citizen to aid the Democratic party in restoring good government and white suprem acy in North Carolina. The address is a call to duty and should awaken a response from every trua son of the State .who desires the blessings which can only be secured through the great Democratic party THE MESSAGE. The message presented to Congress Monday by the President is not conspicuous for originality of Ideas and we do not think it deserves to be classified as a very strong State paper. Of course it was to be expected that the Apostle of protection would commend the -Dingley tariff, the strongest exponent of that idea ever placed upon the statute books,, not withstanding it has failed to proved a revenue producer and that the deficit has grown under its opera tion. The public was somewhat curious to see what the President would say

H. upon the important subject of cur rency, but tre public's stock of wisdom in reference to the question will not be burdened to the overflow ing point after having read his re marks pertaining thereto. He says the present financial system is an evil and is costly facts that most people know and appreciate and con frse but he fails to even hazard a specific for the trouble. His recom mendations along this line bear the impress of. inability to fathom the great problem and his suggestions may be apjtly termed makeshifts and experiments, with a tendency to still further increase the burdens upon the people by a continuance of currency contraction by, practically, retiring United States notes. He refers to the international monetary commission farce and sug gests the hope that certain barriers to the successful culmination of the efforts of the envoys may yet be re moved. A very weak thread upon which to hang the expectations of a settlement ot our currency troubles, to be sure. j The President dwells at length upon the Cuban question and denom inates it the most important problem of our foreign relations, and yet what he says reminds one very much of the charge to a jury of a Judge, who was exceedingly anxious to avoid the suspicion of leaning to one side or the other. He admits that Cuba's desire to be free is a natural instinct and that Spain's warfare upon the island has been uncivilized. However, he appears to place con fidence in the reform movements of the Sagastan government, opposes recognition of Cuban belligerency and advocates a continuance of a waiting policy, with an intimation that some of these days, if SpaiL fails to pacify Cuba, the United States may feel it to be its duty to offer serious interference. In passing, it may be remarked that the Presi dent puts more faith than most folks in the promised reforms of Spain. Somewhat in contradistinction to his Cuban policy is the President's pronnnciamento in favor of the annexation of Hawaii. Moat Ameri cans had rather have one Cuba than many Hawaiis, if the question of citizenship is considered in such a transaction. It really appears ludicrous to hear such a rantankerous high tariff leader pleading for reciprocity, the very opposite of high tariff The President's reaffirmation of adherence to the civil Bervice-system will call torth many grunts ot dis approval from pie hunting Republi cans. The Caucasian, Butler's paper, states what is absolutely untrue in saying that Mr. Clement Manly "made a speech against the adoption of a free silver resolution in his county convention in the spring of last year " The free silver resolu tion received only two or three negative votes and Mr. Manly was not one of those who so voted. We remember distinctly that Mr. Manly made a speech after the resolutions had been adopted and that he acquiesced in the action of the Con vention.

The Chairman's upler did work during the campaign and his recei t endorsement at the hands of the State Executive Committee give the lie to the Caucasian's unjust insinuations. Dingley announces that he is per fectly satisfied with the working of the Dingley tariff It was hardly to be expected that he would renounce hid work so early, and yet it is umaz ing how little it takes to bring- satis faction to a politician when hid owi record figures in the reckoning. The people do not look at this iniquitous inpRsure through the glasses turned out at the Dingley lens factory, and if the father of the tariff bill is sincere in his present expressions 'he will have occasion to wonder what struck bioa when it comes time for the people to express their opinion of the tariff bill. Fool ball continues to claim vic tims. The New York World puts the record this early in the season at "8 killed, 17 maimed or injured , for life, and 126 jumped on until they were insensible or badly hurt." Still this brutality is countenanced and en couraged by the management of many colleges and universities, be it said to their discredit. It is time that othtr States should follow the example of Georgia and enact laws against this practice, which is more fatal than the prize fight and fre quently as inhuman.

It is verv mu.h needed and is really popular and growing in favor. We lately saw it mentioned that Senator Mason, of Illinois, favored it, and had recently discussed it in a public speech in his state. . In the last congress, it will be recalled there were resolutions introduced looking to the change, and it was understood to be popular with the members. Th people can he trusted to choose their own offieiuls and legislators. They should have the right to vote directly for pretd iei t und senators as for members of tie federal house and for governor. We have never seen a reason offered in opposition that was not built upon a distrust of the very people who support the government and uphold and preserve it, and that was not flimsy and untenable.

Lioet Their Purchasing Power. Atlanta Constitution. The financial editor of the New York Evening Post must have met a man with a light. Commenting on the condition of the dry goods market, he remarks: "The purchasing power with buyers for consumption seems to be ex tremely limited in all lines of prints." The editor has here run full against the whole secret of the hard times, and has exposed it to the gaze of the public possibly without realizing tha importance of the discovery. Never theless he states a fundamental fact. Not only in prints, but in all lines of marketable goods, the reduction of the purchasing power of consumers has made its baneful influence felt.

Publisher Gazette Restored to Health bv Paine's Celery The Haverhill Gazette, now in the front rank of newspapers, stands for the journalistic ability of one man. John B. Wright impressed his strong personality on the paper from the day that he secured control. His aenrate sense of news and steady judgement of men and events has built up the Haverhill Gazette to its present newspaper leadership of northern Massachusetts. Editor Wright's long and brilliant work on the Boston Herald, as chief of department of "spesial writers," has all been utilized in the building up of this successful newsp aper. It will surprise no one that getting out a big newspaper, like the Gazette. morning after morning and year at ! ter year, in the heat and smoke of i fierce political conflicts, should en taile great menttl and physical , strain.
