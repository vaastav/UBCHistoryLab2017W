EDITORIAL NOTES. A full pajre of our space this week is given to President Roosevelt's mes ege. As the first message of the new president, it will be read with much interest. The MrCwIIotigh frii't to the Odd Fellows Home has been the meant of determining to quite an extent "who's who" among the newspapers of the state. They say in Washington that Con gressman Foster of Vermont, who makes his debut this session, is the handsomest member of the House. "Handsome is as handsome does." ISrattleboro has three doorkeepers in the national Houses of Congress. Their motto is, "I had rather be a doorkeeper in the House of Congress than to dwell in the tents of wicked ness." "Mr. Dooley" gave ltoosevelt the worst roasting he ever got in his article, "Alone in Cubin." The presi dent paid him back last week by en tertaining him several days at the White House. It is now nnnounced that the pros peels are that the two I.nmoille county candidates for secretary of state will come to an understanding and only one of them will claim the county's support. Which will lie down inside the other ? The canal treaty that was mangled beyond recognition by the last Senate will be known us the l'auncefote-llay treaty. The one just concluded, in which American rights are duly safe guarded, will be known as the J!ay Pauncetote treaty. This emphasizes the dilference between the two. The Populist pirty is dead. Its sen ators and representatives in Congress have formally allied themselves with the Hemocracy, and Populism will henceforth be a relie of the past only. It was during Cleveland's administra tion a threatening movement, but the Democracy trimmed sails to meet it and it fell into the pocket of the old I'rty. A man's house caught tire in North field. The liretnen did their best to save the property. After the fire, the ehiet of the tire department was some what surprised to receive from the party a bill for if 10 worth ol whiskey which he alleged the firemen stofe from the burning house and imbibed while lighting the flames. It was probably of the incombustible kind, and could have been left inide with entire safety. To be sure it is a spectacle calcu lated to open the eyes of the grandees ot Europe and many in thiseountry that the children of President ltoose velt attend the public schools ot Washington, instead of being clois tered under private instruction. Rut it is not done tor show purposes. The president is wise enough to know that the welfare of his children requires that they should meet their fellows on the one common plane afforded by the public schools. The Iscst hope of democracy is the public school and its j worst enemy private tutelage. A few voices from the anxious seats and the. waited sepulchres may be heard lamenting the indecorum ot the president of this great country attend ing a footlall game, and so far for- ' getting the dignity of hi position as j actually to yell with the crowd and to Jump over a fence, silk hat in hand, so as to get a U'tter view ot the proceed ings, tmt the great mass of Americans love ltoosevelt the better for it and their respect for him and his exalted otll-e is not one whit lessened because they have evidence that the same warm blood that pulses through their reins animates the presidential frame. Would that more of our public men were of Koosevelt's stripe and acted their own natural selves. In the town of Waldcn, of the 8o0 or I) cows tested, only two were found 

HERALD AND NEW5, affected, while in the town of Willis ton, ot over a thousand tested, fully .v,.,. r.i,r,h. tt-vro condemned. The Hurlington News points out that in the former town the ratio of deaths j lrom consumption for the last five! years was one to 191, while in the lat ,.e toa n if was onlv one to 2ly. This . would seem to indicate that tubercu- losis in cattle acts as a preventive to tuberculosis in the individual. It certainly sustains l'rof. Koch's theory that the two diseases are not at all allied and that tuberculous products may be eaten with impunity. We im agine that the next session ot the leg islature will see this subject pretty well threshed out. There is a good deal about it that is not understood, but such subjects are the very ones j that Vermont legislatures delight in. LAW AS A SWORD; NOTASHIELD. Law is all right enough, but in it, as in most matters, it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Vermont is law-ridden. Successive legislatures assemble, and, to make a pretence of doing something, pass more laws, until the state is tied up with a net work of statutes that no man can tathom. If you doubt this, make an honest effort to post up on your duties as a citizen by reading the Vermont statutes. You will probably learn to your surprise that you are doing things every day that subject you to fine and possible imprisonment, if taken up. Vastly more sense is shown In law- enforcement than in law-enaction, but the possibilities of our statutes for causing trouble and suffering and ex pense w'thout any compensating pub lic advantages are unlimited. It you have nn enemy, there is a safe and certain way for you to pay the grudge. Head up the Vermont statutes, watch your opportunity and revenge is as certain as daylight. When complaints are made as the law provides, what ever the animus, the ollicers must do their duty in enforcement. Then the unlucky victim is haled to court and branded as a public offender, con victed and penalized, when, in fact, he has violated some mere technicality that no one except an enemy would stop to notice. Cases of this kind will occur to all readers. A fresh instance is reported by the Montpelier Journal. A woman ofl'.erlin was arrested, under indict ment, for keeping an unlicensed dog. She was complained of by a spitetul neighbor. She was ignorant that she had violated any law. There was nothing to do but plead guilty. Her fiue of $1,5 she was unable to pay, and would have had to work it out at Rut land had not friends come forward and paid it. One-third of the fine wrung from this woman went to the venge ful complainant. The majesty of the law had been vindicated and justice smiled in triumph ! The Journal well says : "This is the law it may be good law but it is not justice. Constables in towns and policemen in cities of the state are warranted in shooting at sight all unlicensed dogs. Surely that ought to be sulllcient to protect the stale against any great number of canines on which the owners have not paid the tax provided by law. After the law makers of 1902 have tinkered to their heart's content the woodchuck, muskrat, hedgehog, moose, deer and caribou laws, amend ed the age at which a puppy becomes a dog, framed a new set ot rules for road commissioners, legalized the grand list of a few towns in which the ollicers did not know their duty, and decided whether or not it is wise to spray fruit trees in blossom, they might do vorse than to repeal out right this law pertaining to unlicensed dogs, which is s ire to work hardships in individual cases, ami has done so in one instance during the present term of Washington county court." A similar case occurred in a neigh boring town. For sheltering an un licensed dog that had come to him, and then killing it, a man was appre hended, and. tK'ing unable to settle the case because he was poor, he was taken to Chelsea jail, where he is now in eontinenr'ut. A wife and three little children were left without a pro vider, destitute, and compelled to call on the town for help, tif what conse quence are all the dogs and dog laws this side of Tophet compared to the hardships of human beings needlessly caused by their operation? Are our laws for dogs and deer and muskrats and lawyers or are they for men and women ? If all the copies of the Vermont statutes in existence should be as sembled in one place, and, some dark night, fire should break out and con sume all the volumes but one and alrout half of that, Vermont would be vastly better off until the next legis lative session assembled.

DECEMBER 5, 1901. SILVER LAKE. REAL ESTATE. A large deal recently resulted in about 4HI acre of Barnard's timbered land changing hand. Messrs. Hadlev of Marion, Mass., sold two lots to Frank P. Robinson of Hudson, N. H., and John A. Jacquith of Tilton, game state, for the round aum of f lsoo. Thit land haa been in the Hadley family probably forty years; has heavy timber, prineillv spruce; haa never been culled, none taken out only what has been stolen. The same party also bought of that live real estate dealer, Wm. H. Edmunds of Beibtl, the well-known Dauiel Angell timber lot of Wrt acres and the Edward Brannon lot of 100, both in Barnard join ing the Hadley :; price paid for the last two fl3U0. , . We understand that Robinson and Jaquith will another year erect a large team mill and commence the manufact ure of lumber on an extensive scale. DOOB. Barnard was congratulating herself on the increased number and liner breeds of dogs over former years, making a larger revenue from licenses, but now comes the reaction in paying for sheep killed. The selectmen were quite busy Saturday, the 3oth, auditing and paying bills presented. The amount was much larger than for merlymore than the increased revenue so the dog speculation is not a howling success. Fox hounds are a grand breed, affording the owner a luxury no other dog can give him, also of great benefit to poultiy raisers, helping the income for taxes. Now comes the pullhaclt in this case. According to the present miserable deer law, no dog is allowed to follow a deer off his owner's premises under a penalty of death and a 100 tine, one-half to tbe com plainant. A recent cane coming to my knowledge reads as follows: One of the finest fox hounds in this section of Ver mont, one that had never an inclination for any w ild game but the fox, born, rear ed and educated for this and this only, was out one day following a cold track. In crossing the hills a common cur, worth less tor any purpose, went on in company, the hound making no objection, supHis inir him to be resnectable. Soon the two, running together, started up a young deer, the cur, a shepherd, yelling in pur auit. the hound trailing. On they went until they reached the river w nere lue deer crossed, going into the forest safely; but Mr. Hound found himself locked in a county official's, arms. He made no denial of beiiig in bad company or of identifica tion, showing his legal collar plainly marked w ith the owner's name. Acknow l edging his guilt, a siring confined him until his master was notified. He came at once and was allowed to take the dog home alive to await the action of Windsor count v court. Who can say that this poor dog or his owner are guilty of breaking any legal statute of the state of Vermont ?
