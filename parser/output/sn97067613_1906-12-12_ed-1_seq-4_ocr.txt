News and Citizen MORRISVILLE AND HYDE PARK L. H.LEWIS, EDITOR '.VLDWESDAY, DCCIMBER 12, 1906. The dcnth of Gov. Ilcnrtce lcnves but few of the old-time active mem bers of the Lamoille County Bar; in fact Col. Sawyer of Hyde Park and Judge Powers of Morrisville are the onl two kit of the hire and strong membership of tliecounly bar twenty five years ugo. The fearless men who are naviga ting the air with more or less success,' say their vehicles will soon take the place of those that move on land or sea. Perhaps they wi'l, but seeing is believing. Railway and other trans portation shares no tendency to slump oil account of the prediction. The death of O. S. Bliss of Georgia, Yt., will cause sincere regret on li e part of many of the fanners of La nioille county, who had an acquaint ance with him. II; was inteiested in the organization of the Vermont Dairymen's Association and in many ways, especially by his pen and voice, aided in the improvement and enlight enment of the Vermont farm and the Vermont farmer. He will be greatly missed at the meetings of the Assoeia tiou. Osage Indians do not come under the name of " the poor Indian." Each member of the tribe will be worth at least $50,000 in land and annuities with the allotments they are now takin Indian Territory, making them the richest Indiansin theUnited States. Alaska will henceforth have a voice (though not a vote) in the Congress of the United States. The new representative of the territory, Frank H. Uaskey, was presented in the House last week and sworn in. The appearance of a delegate from that far away portion of the nation al domain elicited great applause from the members. Heartiest congratulations to Col. G. Benedict, senior editor of the Bur lington Free Press, who on Monday last reached the grand age of SO years." Nomanhasseenmorechangcs and improvements in theart of print ing, a newspaper : than he, and no man has been identified with the pres3 of Vermont a longer period, and no man has done more with his pen for the good of the state. With the press of the entire state we join most heartily in wishing the grand old editor many more years of life, and we trust they will be filled with the happiness that a long life of usefulness is worthy of. Mark Twain is crushed again. Anothet New England public library has, more or less contumeliously " t'run out " one of his books. This time it is the library at Worcester, Mass., and the book is "Eve's Diary," which contains fifty or more etchings of Eve in the costume which prevailed at the time of her residence in the garden of Eden. The librarian, a "respectable married lady," looked the book through and through, and was horror-stricken at the pictures. She showed them to the trustees, who are men, and they agreed with her; so out goes another of the Twain books. This time, howevei , it is the pictures and not the subject-matter, so Uncle Mark needn't feel so bad as in the case of" Huckleberry Finn." 8 jTh$ .Japanese question, tfrqariL upon at some length in message, and wnich i the YresufetjS has become a "question" because of the refusal of certain San Francisco schools to ad mit Japanese pupils, caused a great deal of discussion in Congress at the opening of the session, and indeed it should. TheCalifornians, if they are so deathly afraid of the Japs, may send them along east, where we will guatantee to get along with them and make useful citizens of them. We have but little sympathy with California's perennial nightmare over the "yellow peril," because there's no peril to it. We would gladly trade off some of our Rutheniums, Czechs. Libyans, Dalmatians, Serbs and other outlandish people, dumped into our eastern ports, for a few smart, quick, alert, up-to-date Japs That's how we feel about it. CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. . ! The wise Huli. lav buyer does not wait until just before Christmas to make purchases of articles for pres. cnts. He begins early, when the shelves are full, the variety complete, and there is no rush and hurry on the part of both buyer and seller. He has, in fact, already begun, and will be well through with the work before some others get awake to the fact that Christmas is coming. The loyal citizen always docs his holiday trading at home. He would do this, even if it were done at some disadvantage, but it is really to bis own advantage, as well as to the home dealer, that he makes his pur chases here. ,IIe saves time and money by trading at home, and in the vast majority of instances he is better suited with his purchases, with the piivilege of change if for any rea son that is desirable, than if he trans acted his trading by mail or went to the city. Besides.it is only fair to home merchants, who help b.ar the public burdens, who a.c public spirited and ready to aid every worthy cause, to give them the full measure of tfie home Holiday trade. Thus one assists another and each work for the go jd of all. - Before starting in on your Holiday advertising you would do well to consult the ad vertising columns of the Ni;vs and Citizen, which contain a complete Holiday directory. Our advertisers are men of standing and responsibility in the community, and their statements are to be relied upon as absolutely correct. Why the Longevity of Our Ex-Governors? The death of ex-Gov. Hendee again breaks the chain of Vermont's long line of living ex-Goveriiors, of whom, prior to his death, there were fifteen, a larger number by more than double those of any other state in the Union. Can this fact be accounted for upon any other theory than that Vermont' calls to the Executi vechair a class of men, the calm serenity of whose pri vate lives, as a whole, is a little su perior to those of her sister states ? The pure water which flows down our mountain sines, tn pure air which is the proverbial possession of our mountain state, may account in part for the superior longevity of out Vermont Governors, but may it not be true that the public men of other states live faster than those ot Ver io jnt ? Far be it from us to speak dis respect 'tillyoF thc Executives of our sister states; but we are confronted with a fact and not a theory, and it seems to us that that fact is worthy of consideration. One state has only one living ex Governor and we believe that no state except Vermont has more than seven, and that we should have four teen it seems to us warrants some thing more than a passing comment. Does it not speak volumes for the up rightness, safnity, temperance and puiity of the men which Vermont calls to occupy the Executive chair? Think over the list from Holbrook of '62 to Proctor of '06 and see if you re-call the names of any who do not measure up to a high standard in these particulars; and is it not' to this fact that we largely owe our su periority in the matter of the longev ity of our ex Governors ? And if this is so, does not the fact constitute an object lesson well worth emphasizing? PARADISE VALLEY. Fred Dairs and family are moving Into the house with liob't Reed.

C, Dec. 8, 1000, Dear Nchlihors ; Usually on top of Thanksgiving comes the President's message, his annual instructions and advice to Congress, and by that sin you know hat the lid is off and Congress is "off." The message came in Tuesday last, the second day of the session and in length and number of subjects treated it breaks all records. Of course there are some who don't en dorse it all among the members of both houses, but as to that, there are some who don't wholly agree with the Sermon on the Mount, so, it seems, neither human nor divine can please everybody. But the vast ma joiity of both Democrats and Repub licans are pretty thoroughly in ac cord with its essen'ial suggestions. Each member of the two houses was given a ropy of the message as the respective clerks began to read it, hut the reading occupied over two and one half hours and many of the Sen ators and members of the House i e came weary with attentive listening and wandered out long before ihe reading wis concluded. The California delegation in the House has been up in arms ever since because of the President's language on the Japanese question, but it is altogether likely that the ebullition will simmer down and that peace and harmony will continue to pre vail. All ihe talk of war with Japan or that California will eecede from the Union and set up an ana foreign government is of course only the idle hot air of the hour. In many years of attendance I do not remember to have seen as full an attendanceof members ofboth houses as there was Monday. Though the proceedings were very brief and unin teresting, yet the galleries were packed with visitors to, the doors long before high noon when in the absence of a previous resolution to the contrary both houses' met and hundreds who were disappointed in not being ab e to obtain seats wan- ('ered aimlessly around the corridors and asked questions. Ot these latter, move a little later. As to the galler ies, the arrangements are the same in both the House and Senate. Im mediately behind and over the Vice President and Speaker is the press gallery, for seeing and hearing, the most eligible of all Admis sion to this is only given jointly by the pre siding officer of each house to the accredited Washington correspond ent of the newspapers of thiscountry and Europe, and the admission holds good while the correspondent acts in the capacity in which he was admit ted. It goes without saying that the " press boys " here are the flo wrtft and pick of the world's journalism, ! many of them bearing names well known herever the English lan-1 guage is read and spoken. Beside this gallery thare are two "card galleries '' admission to which is only by the official card of a Sena tor or member of the House, issued by him to any friend. Then there are two men's galleries, a ladies' gal lery and in the Senate a Senators' gallery and in the House a member's gallery. There is no admission to any one of these except to those who are personally introduced by a Senator or Member. Finally, there is the diplomatic gallery in each House reserved rigidly for member attaches of foreign legations. Usu ally these galleries are vacant, and hardly ever occupied by more than two or three ultra distinguished vis itors. The foreigners appear to take very little interest in our system of lawmaking. I will add that one half of the front row in the Senator's and Member's gallery is strictly and al ways reserved for the family of the President. As for the President himself, he is the one man in the wide world Jwho, by an unwritten law, cannot look at either house in sesson. Bythe same unwritten law he cannot enter the Capitol except once a year. He is expected in his room in the rear of -a-;l Ilia fui-u'i. .a . schoolboy ' was taH.' the Senate just one-half hour before Congress adjourns. Otherwise, if not sigii"d before adjournment, they would fail.' It would require too much time to send them to the VYIiitt House and get them buck therefore, for this purpose and on this (ktumou only, he must be on the spot. The President's ro in is always open in charge ot fin attendant, and visitors inspect it at their pleasure.

As a matter of fact, Congressman "Nick."
